<text>Richard is a male given name. It originates, via Old French, from Old Frankish and is a compound of the words descending from Proto-Germanic &quot;*rīk-&quot; &#x27;ruler, leader, king&#x27; and &quot;*hardu-&quot; &#x27;strong, brave, hardy&#x27;, and it therefore means &#x27;strong in rule&#x27;. Nicknames include &quot;Richie&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, &quot;Dickon&quot;, &quot;Dickie&quot;, &quot;Rich&quot;, &quot;Rick&quot;, &quot;Rico&quot;, &quot;Ricky&quot;, and more.

Richard is a common English (the name was introduced into England by the Normans), German and French male name. It&#x27;s also used in many more languages, particularly Germanic, such as Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, and Dutch, as well as other languages including Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Finnish. Richard is cognate with variants of the name in other European languages, such as the Swedish &quot;Rickard&quot;, the Portuguese and Spanish &quot;Ricardo&quot; and the Italian &quot;Riccardo&quot; (see comprehensive variant list below).

<text>Cornelis Lely (; 23 September 1854 – 22 January 1929) was a Dutch politician of the Liberal Union and civil engineer. He oversaw the passage of an act of parliament authorising construction of the Zuiderzee Works, a huge project – designed to his own plans – that turned the Zuiderzee into a lake and made possible the conversion of a vast area of former seabed into dry land. Lelystad, the capital of the province of Flevoland, is named after him.

== Early life ==
Cornelis Lely was born on 23 September 1854 in Amsterdam, son of an oilseed trader. Lely went to the Hogere Burgerschool (HBS). He later studied at the Polytechnic School of Delft and graduated as civil engineer in 1875.

==Career outline==
Between 1886 and 1891, Lely led the technical research team that explored the possibility, later approved by a State Commission, of enclosing the Zuiderzee. The Dutch parliament passed the law creating the Zuiderzee Works on 14 June 1918, using Lely&#x27;s plan. He served three times as Minister of Transport and Water Management (in 1891–1894, 1897–1901, and 1913–1918) and in this role was hugely influential in advocating the implementation of his own plans. The scheme was finally approved and realised after severe flooding along the shores of the Zuiderzee in 1916.

In 1898 as minister he implemented a law on local railroads and tramways, which played a significant role in the development of the Dutch countryside.

In 1895 Lely became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Lely was governor of Suriname from 1902 to 1905. In Suriname, he achieved the initiation and construction of the Lawa Railway from Paramaribo to Benzdorp.

==Remembrance==
The city of Lelystad, situated in the Eastern Flevoland polder and capital of Flevoland province, was named after him. The flags of the province and of the city are both adorned with a white fleur-de-lys to note his contribution.

In the city of Amsterdam the &quot;Cornelis Lelylaan&quot;, a major thoroughfare, is named after him and the Amsterdam Lelylaan station, one of the city&#x27;s main railway stations, is situated on this road.

In 1905, the Surinamese village of Kofi Djompo was renamed Lelydorp in his honour; Lely having led the construction of a new railway from Paramaribo that ran through the area. Most of the railway has now gone, but Lelydorp survives and is now the capital of Wanica District. It lies on the road from Paramaribo to Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport.

A statue of Lely stands on the western point of the Afsluitdijk. It was sculpted by Mari Andriessen and dedicated on 23 September 1954, the 100th anniversary of Lely&#x27;s birth. A replica of this statue stands in the center of Lelystad, on a tower of basalt blocks, designed by . In Lelystad&#x27;s city hall is a statue of Lely made by Piet Esser.

<text>The Beita incident was a confrontation that took place between Israeli settlers from Elon Moreh and Palestinian residents of Beita, on 6 April 1988. Three people were killed and several others wounded.

==Incident==
The incident occurred when a group of 15 teenagers from the Israeli settlement of Elon Moreh, north of Beita, had gone hiking during the Passover school holiday accompanied by a guide and two guards, Romam Aldube and Menachem Ilan. About 10 kilometres South of Elon Moreh, whilst on land belonging to Beita village, they came across a farmer, Mousa Saleh Bani Shamseh. After an exchange of words, Romam Aldube shot him dead. The group then continued into the village.

Within the village a rumour had spread that the Israelis had come to poison the village well. A crowd gathered and confronted the group. Palestinian residents said the guards provoked the incident by shooting 19-year-old, Hatem Fayez Ahmd al-Jaber who approached the Israelis. Other reports describe the mother of Mousa Saleh throwing a stone at Aldube. The crowd then charged the hikers, disarming the guards and destroyed their guns. Aldube received a serious head wound. 15-year-old Israeli Tirza Porat from Elon Moreh was killed during this incident. She was the first Israeli civilian casualty in the West Bank during the First Intifada.

Initial reports in the media stated that Tirza Porat had been killed by Palestinian stone throwers. An official statement spoke of the group falling &#x27;into the hands of pogromists and murderers&#x27;. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir attended her funeral at which there were cries of &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Wipe Beita off the map&quot;. The following day the IDF revealed that she had been accidentally shot in the head with the M16 carbine belonging to Romam Aldubi, a Jewish 26-year-old violence-prone religious nationalist. It was also revealed that &#x27;the young settlers, instructed by their elders, had rendered untruthful accounts.&#x27; Despite knowing from the start who was responsible the Israeli Army dynamited 15 buildings in Beita. They also killed a sixteen-year-old boy Issam Abdul Halim Mohammad Said and arrested all male adult residents, six of whom were later deported. Romam Aldubi was brought to trial in Israel, but the charges were dropped on the grounds &quot;that what had happened [was] already punishment enough&quot;.

Chief of Staff Gen. Dan Shomron later said that Palestinian villagers protected the Israelis from further harm. Some residents helped the teenagers, including several women who hid three girls inside their homes.

A medic in a CBS News crew on site began treating the Israelis injured, some of whom were evacuated by Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulances. As well as the two fatalities several villagers suffered severe gunshot wounds. Three people were killed and several others wounded.

<doc id="1189386" wikidata="Q1634050" url="?curid=1189386" title="Horseshoe orbit">
<text>In celestial mechanics, a horseshoe orbit is a type of co-orbital motion of a small orbiting body relative to a larger orbiting body. The osculating (instantaneous) orbital period of the smaller body remains very near that of the larger body, and if its orbit is a little more eccentric than that of the larger body, during every period it appears to trace an ellipse around a point on the larger object&#x27;s orbit.
However, the loop is not closed but drifts forward or backward so that the point it circles will appear to move smoothly along the larger body&#x27;s orbit over a long period of time. When the object approaches the larger body closely at either end of its trajectory, its apparent direction changes. Over an entire cycle the center traces the outline of a horseshoe, with the larger body between the &#x27;horns&#x27;.

Asteroids in horseshoe orbits with respect to Earth include 54509 YORP, , , and possibly . A broader definition includes 3753 Cruithne, which can be said to be in a compound and/or transition orbit, or and . By 2016, 12 horseshoe librators of Earth have been discovered.

Saturn&#x27;s moons Epimetheus and Janus occupy horseshoe orbits with respect to each other (in their case, there is no repeated looping: each one traces a full horseshoe with respect to the other).

==Explanation of horseshoe orbital cycle==

===Background===
The following explanation relates to an asteroid which is in such an orbit around the Sun, and is also affected by the Earth.

The asteroid is in almost the same solar orbit as Earth. Both take approximately one year to orbit the Sun.

It is also necessary to grasp two rules of orbit dynamics:

#A body closer to the Sun completes an orbit more quickly than a body farther away.
#If a body accelerates along its orbit, its orbit moves outwards from the Sun. If it decelerates, the orbital radius decreases.

The horseshoe orbit arises because the gravitational attraction of the Earth changes the shape of the elliptical orbit of the asteroid. The shape changes are very small but result in significant changes relative to the Earth.

The horseshoe becomes apparent only when mapping the movement of the asteroid relative to both the Sun and the Earth. The asteroid always orbits the Sun in the same direction. However, it goes through a cycle of catching up with the Earth and falling behind, so that its movement relative to both the Sun and the Earth traces a shape like the outline of a horseshoe.

===Stages of the orbit===

Starting at point A, on the inner ring between and Earth, the satellite is orbiting faster than the Earth and is on its way toward passing between the Earth and the Sun. But Earth&#x27;s gravity exerts an outward accelerating force, pulling the satellite into a higher orbit which (per Kepler&#x27;s third law) decreases its angular speed.

When the satellite gets to point B, it is traveling at the same speed as Earth. Earth&#x27;s gravity is still accelerating the satellite along the orbital path, and continues to pull the satellite into a higher orbit. Eventually, at Point C, the satellite reaches a high and slow enough orbit such that it starts to lag behind Earth. It then spends the next century or more appearing to drift &#x27;backwards&#x27; around the orbit when viewed relative to the Earth. Its orbit around the Sun still takes only slightly more than one Earth year. Given enough time, the Earth and the satellite will be on opposite sides of the Sun.

Eventually the satellite comes around to point D where Earth&#x27;s gravity is now reducing the satellite&#x27;s orbital velocity. This causes it to fall into a lower orbit, which actually increases the angular speed of the satellite around the Sun. This continues until point E where the satellite&#x27;s orbit is now lower and faster than Earth&#x27;s orbit, and it begins moving out ahead of Earth. Over the next few centuries it completes its journey back to point A.

On the longer term, asteroids can transfer between horseshoe orbits and quasi-satellite orbits. Quasi-satellites aren&#x27;t gravitationally bound to their planet, but appear to circle it in a retrograde direction as they circle the Sun with the same orbital period as the planet. By 2016, orbital calculations showed that four of Earth&#x27;s horseshoe librators and all five of its then known quasi-satellites repeatedly transfer between horseshoe and quasi-satellite orbits.

===Energy viewpoint===
A somewhat different, but equivalent, view of the situation may be noted by considering conservation of energy. It is a theorem of classical mechanics that a body moving in a time-independent potential field will have its total energy, &quot;E = T + V&quot;, conserved, where &quot;E&quot; is total energy, &quot;T&quot; is kinetic energy (always non-negative) and &quot;V&quot; is potential energy, which is negative. It is apparent then, since &quot;V = -GM/R&quot; near a gravitating body of mass &quot;M&quot; and orbital radius &quot;R&quot;, that seen from a &quot;stationary&quot; frame, V will be increasing for the region behind M, and decreasing for the region in front of it. However, orbits with lower total energy have shorter periods, and so a body moving slowly on the forward side of a planet will lose energy, fall into a shorter-period orbit, and thus slowly move away, or be &quot;repelled&quot; from it. Bodies moving slowly on the trailing side of the planet will gain energy, rise to a higher, slower, orbit, and thereby fall behind, similarly repelled. Thus a small body can move back and forth between a leading and a trailing position, never approaching too close to the planet that dominates the region.

==Tadpole orbit==

:&quot;See also Trojan (celestial body).&quot;
Figure 1 above shows shorter orbits around the Lagrangian points and (i.e. the lines close to the blue triangles). These are called tadpole orbits and can be explained in a similar way, except that the asteroid&#x27;s distance from the Earth does not oscillate as far as the point on the other side of the Sun. As it moves closer to or farther from the Earth, the changing pull of Earth&#x27;s gravitational field causes it to accelerate or decelerate, causing a change in its orbit known as libration.

An example of a tadpole orbit is Polydeuces, a small moon of Saturn which librates around the trailing point relative to a larger moon, Dione. In relation to the orbit of Earth, the asteroid is in a tadpole orbit around the leading point.
2020 VT1 follows a temporary horseshoe orbit with respect to Mars.

<text>The British Rail Class 166 &quot;Networker Turbo is a fleet of [[diesel multiple unit#Diesel–hydraulic|diesel-hydraulic multiple unit]] passenger trains, built by [[ABB Group|ABB Transportation]] at their [[Holgate Road carriage works|Holgate Road Works]] in [[York]] between 1992 and 1993. They were specified by and built for [[British Rail]], the state-owned railway operator in [[Great Britain]] at the time. The trains were designed as a faster, air-conditioned variant of the [[British Rail Class 165|Class 165 &quot;Turbo&quot;]], intended for longer-distance services, and, like the 165s, belong to the [[Networker (train)|Networker family of trains]]. They are known as Networker Turbos to distinguish them from the electrically propelled members of that family. Today the 166s, alongside the 165s, are normally referred to as Thames Turbos, the Networker Turbo Express or just simply Turbos&quot;.

The Class 166s are still in service today, solely operated by Great Western Railway. Until 2017, they operated only on express and local services in the Thames Valley area alongside the Class 165 units. In this time, they were based at Reading TMD but since July 2017, the 166 units have been gradually moved over to be based at St Philip&#x27;s Marsh depot to operate local and regional services around Bristol and Exeter. Nowadays, the majority of the 166s are based in Bristol while many 165s remain in the Thames Valley.

==Description==
These units are a modification of the Class 165 design. They have a top speed of (suitable for mainline use), are carpeted throughout, and have air-conditioning. Externally, the class 166 can be distinguished from a Class 165 by opening hoppers on every other window. Until late 2013 the presence of first class at each end was another distinguishing feature.

Other differences over a 165 are as follows:
*Air conditioning
*Two toilets (a 165 only has one toilet per unit)
*Tables in first class and in one third of the middle carriage
*Dedicated cycle/luggage storage in the middle carriage
*Different interior panelling between the door and seating areas

Twenty-one 3-car units were built, numbered 166201-221. Each unit was formed of two outer driving motors, and an intermediate motor. The technical description of the formation is DMCL-MS-DMSL. Individual carriages are numbered as follows:
*58101-58121 - DMCL
*58601-58621 - MS
*58122-58142 - DMSL (changed from DMCL in 2013)

The units were built to replace Class 117, Class 119 and Class 121 DMUs, and locomotive-hauled trains on services from London Paddington along the Great Western Main Line.

Six cars were added to the original order in 1991 after Network SouthEast acquired some of the Cotswold Line services from Regional Railways to allow Class 158 units to be converted to Class 159s for the &quot;West of England&quot; services.

Their operation in the Bristol area is slightly different. All services in the Bristol area have guards and will in the future so the trains will not be driver only operated at all in the Bristol area. The practice of the opening/closing of the doors is also different, in which the driver releases the doors which are then closed by the guard. All 166 units now have local door panels fitted in at the doors of the end coaches, this is to allow the units to stop at stations with short platforms such as Avoncliff and Dilton Marsh. In these instances, the guard releases only their local door with these new panels, so drivers do not release the doors at the stations with short platforms. This method of operation has now been retrofitted to North Downs and Oxfordshire services.

==Operations==

When built, these units were operated by the &quot;Thames Line&quot; and &quot;North Downs Line&quot; subdivisions of Network SouthEast.

Their main destinations included fast-trains to Reading, Newbury and Oxford, with some services continuing beyond Oxford to Banbury and Stratford-upon-Avon, or along the Cotswold Line to Evesham, Worcester, Great Malvern and Hereford. Units are also used on the Reading to Gatwick Airport services along the North Downs Line. Many services operated by the 166 were branded as &quot;Turbo Express&quot; in the timetables.

Following privatisation, the units passed to the Thames Trains franchise. In April 2004, operation of the Thames Trains franchise passed to the First Great Western Link, and subsequently to First Great Western.

In 2012, First Great Western took delivery of five Class 180 &quot;Adelante&quot; units for Cotswold Line services, and three-car &quot;Sprinter&quot; units for Reading to Basingstoke Line services, allowing Class 165 and 166 units to be used entirely for Thames Valley services.

In July 2017, the 166s began to transfer over to be based at St Philip&#x27;s Marsh depot in Bristol, where they would then begin operation on the Severn Beach line to allow other services to be strengthened further west. Since September 2017, they have rapidly been introduced on other services such as the Weston-super-Mare to Filton Abbey Wood / Bristol Parkway service and the Cardiff Central to Taunton services. In January 2018, they began service on the Golden Valley Line and in February 2018, they began service on the Heart of Wessex Line, as well as operating some services on the Wessex Main Line as far as Warminster and Southampton Central. In January 2019, they also began operating the regional service between Cardiff Central and Portsmouth Harbour which allowed more of the Class 158 units that solely operated this service to move more west.

In December 2020, they began operating on the Riviera Line and Avocet Line following the retirement of the Class 143 units.

The transfer of the 166 (and 165) units to services in and around Bristol and Exeter have overall allowed units that previously operated these services to move further west, such as the Class 150 and Class 158 units. While the majority of the fleet is based at St Phillip&#x27;s Marsh depot now, some of the units still do remain based at Reading TMD for Thames Valley services where they were all planned to be replaced by Class 769 units.

==London and Thames Valley Refresh==

Towards the end of January 2010, First Great Western announced an £8 million refresh programme to their fleet of Class 166 Turbo DMU trains.
The carpets and seats were retrimmed, interiors repainted, Passenger Information Displays replaced with a GPS-based system, and toilets upgraded. The refresh work was carried out at Reading Depot. All 151 vehicles have now been refurbished.

In late 2014, another set of refreshes to the Class 166 was started. The changes made during the 2010 refresh remain in place, with some upgrades, including the fitting of LED head/tail lights, new toilets which are more accessible than the old toilets, new door buzzers &amp; new door buttons of the standard design with a round button on a yellow ring. All units have now received the refresh. Unit 166204 was named in honour of Twyford station master Norman Topsom MBE who retired in November 2015.

<text>The Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) was a Pan-Africanist organization founded by Malcolm X in 1964. The OAAU was modeled on the Organization of African Unity, which had impressed Malcolm X during his visit to Africa in April and May 1964. The purpose of the OAAU was to fight for the human rights of African Americans and promote cooperation among Africans and people of African descent in the Americas.

Malcolm X announced the establishment of the OAAU at a public meeting in New York&#x27;s Audubon Ballroom on June 28, 1964. He had written the group&#x27;s charter with John Henrik Clarke, Albert Cleage, Jesse Gray, and Gloria Richardson, among others. In a memo dated July 2, 1964, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover described the nascent OAAU as a threat to the national security of the United States.

Malcolm X, along with John Henrik Clarke, wrote the following into the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) Basic Unity Program:

# Restoration: &quot;In order to release ourselves from the oppression of our enslavers then, it is absolutely necessary for the Afro-American to restore communication with Africa.&quot;
# Reorientation: &quot;We can learn much about Africa by reading informative books and by listening to the experiences of those who have traveled there.&quot;
# Education: &quot;The Organization of Afro-American Unity will devise original educational methods and procedures which will liberate the minds of our children. We will ... encourage qualified Afro-Americans to write and publish the textbooks needed to liberate our minds ... educating them [our children] at home.&quot;
# Economic Security: &quot;After the Emancipation Proclamation ... it was realized that the Afro-American constituted the largest homogeneous ethnic group with a common origin and common group experience in the United States and, if allowed to exercise economic or political freedom, would in a short period of time own this country. We must establish a technician bank. We must do this so that the newly independent nations of Africa can turn to us who are their brothers for the technicians they will need now and in the future.&quot;
# Self Defense: &quot;In order to enslave a people and keep them subjugated, their right to self defense must be denied. We encourage the Afro-Americans to defend themselves against the wanton attacks of the racist aggressors whose sole aim is to deny us the guarantee of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights and of the Constitution of the United States.&quot;

The OAAU pushed for black control of every aspect of the black community. At the founding rally, Malcolm X stated that the organization&#x27;s principal concern was the human rights of blacks, but that it would also focus on voter registration, school boycotts, rent strikes, housing rehabilitation, and social programs for addicts, unwed mothers, and troubled children. Malcolm X saw the OAAU as a way of &quot;un-brainwashing&quot; black people, ridding them of the lies they had been told about themselves and their culture.

On July 17, 1964, Malcolm X was welcomed to the second meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Cairo as a representative of the OAAU.

When a reporter asked whether white people could join the OAAU, Malcolm X said, &quot;Definitely not.&quot; Then he added, &quot;If John Brown were still alive, we might accept him.&quot;

Malcolm X did not have sufficient time to invest in the OAAU to help it flourish. After his death, Malcolm X&#x27;s half-sister, Ella Little-Collins, took over the leadership of the OAAU, but dwindling membership and Malcolm X&#x27;s absence eventually led to the collapse of the organization.

<text>Charles Wooden VC (24 March 1829 – 24 April 1876) was a German-born soldier in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Crimean War==
He was awarded the Victoria Cross for acts of gallantry during the Crimean War. He was 25 years old, and a sergeant-major in the 17th Lancers (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own), British Army. On 26 October 1854, in the Crimea, at Balaklava, Sergeant-Major Wooden went out with surgeon James Mouat to the assistance of an officer who was lying seriously wounded in an exposed position, after the retreat of the Light Cavalry. He helped to dress the officer&#x27;s wounds under heavy fire from the enemy.

This order, carried by the young Captain Louis Nolan and misinterpreted by Lord Lucan, began one of the most famous of all military engagements – The Charge of the Light Brigade – on 25 October 1854. Charles Wooden rode in this action.

Captain William Morris of the 17th Lancers, with about 20 men as yet comparatively unscathed in the sea of carnage all around, came upon a squadron of Russian Hussars. Ordering his men to keep together, he rode straight at the Russian leader, running him through with his sword with such force that he toppled him over the side of his horse, and, unable to disengage his hand from his sword, fell with him. The Russians closed on Morris and slashed at him with their sabres, cutting through his forage cap until he lost consciousness. He was taken prisoner but, in the confusion of the field, managed to slip away, capture a horse and make a dash for freedom, only to fall from his horse due to his wounds. Pursued by the Russians through the thick smoke of the battlefield, he caught another horse, but fell again when the horse was shot. This time the horse fell on him, trapping his leg. When he came to, in agony from a broken right arm, broken ribs and three deep head wounds, he managed to free his leg and stagger towards the British lines. By a strange coincidence he came across the body of his good friend Captain Nolan; and lay down beside it. (Morris and Nolan had earlier exchanged the letters customary between friends before battle, promising to inform the other&#x27;s loved ones should anything happen to them.) Once again, Morris lapsed into unconsciousness.

An attempt was made by Turkish troops to recover the two men; but, as Russian fire rained down upon them, they abandoned it. A message was then sent to the 17th Lancers; and Sergeant-Major Charles Wooden of the 17th Lancers (who had ridden in the charge, and had had his horse shot from under him) and Surgeon Mouat of the 6th Dragoons, set out under heavy fire to rescue the stricken Morris. After roughly dressing his wounds, they succeeded in returning to their lines. For this action both were to be awarded Britain&#x27;s highest military honour, the Victoria Cross. Morris survived his wounds, and died four years later in India.

Sergeant-Major Wooden was something of a character in the 17th Lancers. One night, returning to camp the worse for wear after a drinking session, he was challenged by the sentry on guard duty, but could not remember the password. &quot;&#x27;tish me&quot;, Wooden whispered in a slurred voice. &quot;Who?&quot; asked the sentry. &quot;&#x27;tish me, &#x27;tish me!&quot; came the answer. Down came the sentry&#x27;s lance as he demanded to know just which &#x27;me&#x27; it was.

By now in a temper, Wooden bellowed: &quot;&#x27;tish me, the Devil&quot;. The sentry, now exercising his better judgement on recognising his Sergeant-Major retorted: &quot;Pass, &#x27;tish me the Devil!&quot; From that moment the nickname stuck and for the remainder of his service with the &#x27;Death or Glory Boys&#x27;, Wooden remained &quot;Tish me the Devil&quot;.

Wooden, a German by birth, was not a popular man in the regiment possibly because of his odd demeanour and strong German accent. Even the award of his VC was controversial. At first he was not entered for the award although Dr Mouat was. Wooden wrote to Dr Mouat saying that if Mouat was to receive a VC then so should he as he had been at Mouat&#x27;s side during the rescue of Lt Col Morris. Dr Mouat agreed, and wrote to the Horse Guards supporting Wooden&#x27;s claim.

The reply to his letter reads: &quot;His Royal Highness feels very unwilling to bring any further claim for the Victoria Cross for an act performed at so distant a period but as the decoration has been conferred on Dr James Mouat for the part he took in the rescue of Lt. Col. Morris and Sergeant-Major Wooden appears to have acted in a manner very honourable to him on the occasion and, by his gallantry, been equally instrumental in saving the life of this officer, His Royal Highness is induced to submit the case.&quot; Wooden&#x27;s VC was gazetted on 26 October 1858.

His VC citation reads:
Wooden&#x27;s other medal entitlements are the Crimea Medal (with bars Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman and Sebastopol), Turkish Medal, French War Medal and the Indian Mutiny Medal.

==Later service==
He exchanged into the 6th Dragoons to become Quartermaster there (presumably with promotion to the rank of officer) in 1860, exchanged into the 5th Lancers in 1865, retired on half-pay in 1871, and was appointed Quartermaster of the 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers) in 1872.

On 14 April 1876 Wooden shot himself following a drinking session, having complained of severe head pains the previous week. An inquest recorded death by suicide due to temporary insanity. He was 47 years old and had served 30 years with the army. He is buried in St James&#x27;s Cemetery, Dover.

==The Medal==
His VC is on display in The Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum in Thoresby Park, Nottinghamshire.

<text>The American Philosophical Association (APA) is the main professional organization for philosophers in the United States. Founded in 1900, its mission is to promote the exchange of ideas among philosophers, to encourage creative and scholarly activity in philosophy, to facilitate the professional work and teaching of philosophers, and to represent philosophy as a discipline. The APA&#x27;s governance has included Robert Audi, Jaegwon Kim and Ruth Barcan Marcus.

==Activities==
The association has three divisions: Pacific, Central, and Eastern. Each division organizes a large annual conference. The biggest of these is the Eastern Division Meeting, which usually attracts around 2,000 philosophers and takes place in a different East Coast city each December. The Eastern Division Meeting is also the United States&#x27; largest recruitment event for philosophy jobs, with numerous universities sending teams to interview candidates for academic posts. The two evening receptions are traditionally referred to as &#x27;smokers,&#x27; a carry over from the days in which smoking was common. These events serve the dual purpose of informally continuing interviews and catching up with friends from across the country.

== Presidents ==
The presidency of a division of the American Philosophical Association is considered to be a professional honor. 

Recent presidents of the Eastern Division include: 
Recent presidents of the Central Division include: 

Recent presidents of the Pacific Division include: 

==Prizes==
The American Philosophical Association awards several prizes. A prominent example is the American Philosophical Association Book Prize (formerly known as the Matchette Foundation Book Prize, one of the oldest prizes in philosophy). It is awarded biannually to the best book published in the field over a two-year period by a &quot;younger scholar&quot; (defined as someone age 40 or younger at the time of publication or someone who received his or her Ph.D. 10 or fewer years before the time of publication). Awarded for the first time in 2000, the Book Prize is now awarded in odd years, alternating with the Article Prize awarded in even years. The APA Book Prize has been won by such figures as David Kellogg Lewis, Lawrence Sklar, Bas van Fraassen, Michael Friedman, Loran Lomasky, Paul Guyer, John Cooper, Ted Sider, and Michael Smith. Another of the most distinguished prizes is the Royce Lectures in the philosophy of mind, awarded to a distinguished philosopher every four years. They have been delivered by Robert Stalnaker, Jerry Fodor, Hilary Putnam, Sydney Shoemaker, Saul Kripke, and Elizabeth Anscombe. Another such prize is the Rockefeller Prize. The Rockefeller Prize ($1,000) is awarded every two years for the best unpublished article-length work in philosophy by a non-academically affiliated philosopher. The winning work is then published in the &quot;Journal of Value Inquiry&quot; at the behest of the winner and the journal.

==Other philosophical societies==
While the APA serves as the main learned society for philosophy professors in North America, many other philosophy societies have sprung up to serve as venues for philosophers to specialize.

Next to the APA, the second largest philosophic society is the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, which was created in 1962 by American philosophers who were interested in continental philosophy, some of whom were dissatisfied with the analytic approach of the APA. Since then, however, many members of SPEP have participated extensively in the APA and have also served in leadership positions, including Linda Alcoff and Edward S. Casey.

<doc id="1189405" wikidata="Q7205161" url="?curid=1189405" title="Ploutis Servas">
<text>Ploutis Servas (Πλουτής Σέρβας in Greek; 22 May 1907 – 14 February 2001), was a Cypriot former politician, reporter, and author. Servas was born Ploutarhos Loizou Savvidis (Πλούταρχος Λοΐζου Σαββίδης) and changed his surname to Servas while still a student in secondary education.

Servas was born in Limassol in 1907. In 1929–1934, he studied political and social sciences at the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West in Moscow. He returned to Cyprus in the 1930s and had to sign a declaration saying he would not be involved in politics in order to be allowed to set foot in the country. He became a member of the Secretariat of the illegal Communist Party of Cyprus (CPC) and founder and first general secretary of AKEL (1941–1945). He was also the first elected Mayor of Limassol 1943–1946 and 1946–1949. As mayor he participated in the consultative assembly and advocated accepting the British plan of self-government for Cyprus in 1948. For that opinion he became isolated within his party and was expelled in 1952.

He supported Ioannis Clerides in the 1960 elections, but wasn&#x27;t an active politician again himself. He worked mainly as a reporter and a writer. He wrote multiple books on political issues.

His death on 14 February 2001 caused controversy in Cyprus as in his will he had asked to be cremated. There were no crematoria in Cyprus and there was a heated debate between those supporting the availability of cremation as an alternative and those (mainly religious Orthodox Christians) who disapproved of it.

<doc id="1189409" wikidata="Q2005153" url="?curid=1189409" title="Military Staff Committee">
<text>The Military Staff Committee (MSC) is the United Nations Security Council subsidiary body whose role, as defined by the United Nations Charter, is to plan UN military operations and assist in the regulation of armaments. Although the Military Staff Committee continues to exist, negotiation efforts between the United States, the Soviet Union and other nations in the late 1940s failed, and the committee has since been largely defunct, only serving in an advisory capacity.

The greatest purpose of the MSC, arising from Article 45 of the UN Charter, was intended to provide command staff for a set of air-force contingents. These contingents, provided by the permanent five members of the Security Council (the Republic of China (now the People&#x27;s Republic of China), France, the Soviet Union (now Russia), the United Kingdom, and the United States), were to be held at ready for the discretionary use of the United Nations.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the United States Department of State in 1939. The Declaration by United Nations was made on 1 January 1943 by an initial 29 states representing the Allies of World War II in support of the principals of the Atlantic Charter. A security subcommittee was established on 15 April 1942, and in 1943, members of the US Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC) joined the committee. The JSSC soon began leading planning for a joint-military force after the end of World War II. They changed the terminology of the organization from an &quot;international police force&quot; to &quot;international military force&quot; and recommended creating spheres of influence around the world, where the United States, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union would maintain international forces. Under the plan, the United States was to have responsibility for the Americas, Great Britain and the Soviet Union would have joint responsibility the rest of the world; with the exception of the Far East, which would be the responsibility of all three powers and China. The JSSC approached planning from a nationalistic angle, believing a multi-national force impractical.
After being modified by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, the plan was spread through the United States Department of State, where Cordell Hull, the Secretary of State, favored an multi-national organization. Hull was dedicated to the project and formed a new drafting committee that discarded the spheres of influence plan. After the Moscow Conference of 1943, the Moscow Declarations were issued on 30 October 1943. The declarations favored establishing a multi-national organization.

After extensive planning, a draft charter was completed by 29 April 1944. The draft proposed having member nations maintain forces that could be called into action. If the forces were used, they would be led by a Security and Armaments Commission. Though written by Americans, some senators feared the nation&#x27;s autonomy would be lost under the plan. Hull countered by saying that the troops would not be under United Nations control, and that details would be decided later and voted on by the Senate. At the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944, the Soviet Union and United Kingdom supported the plan over Soviet proposals for an international air force. The Soviet Union also proposed putting bases in smaller nations at the conference, but withdrew the proposal after American resistance.

It was at the conference that the concept of a Security and Armaments Commission was replaced by a Military Staff Committee, a British proposal based on the US/UK Combined Chiefs of Staff command structure used in World War II. Minor changes to the plan were made at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in 1945. The UN was formally established 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council—France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the UK and the US—and by a majority of the other 46 signatories. The MSC was established in Article 46 and 47 of the Charter, which defines the membership of the Committee as &quot;the Chiefs of Staff of the permanent members of the Security Council or their representatives&quot;. In the first United Nations Security Council Resolution, the Military Staff Committee was established and directed to meet in London on 1 February 1946.

In the UN Charter, the MSC is designated to advise and assist the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on &quot;plans for the application of armed force&quot; and is made &quot;responsible under the Security Council for the strategic direction of any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council&quot;.

=== Early discussion ===

Though the charter had been approved, much of the MSC&#x27;s function was still undecided. The British favored a &quot;high powered and effective body&quot; whereas the United States preferred a far more limited body. By mid-October 1945, the United States had proposed its view of the MSC and its function. Conflict over the organization&#x27;s size continued: air force generals such as Henry H. Arnold wanted a large United Nations air force that would be flexible and able to display the organization&#x27;s power. United States Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower sent General Matthew Ridgway as his representative; Eisenhower supported the UN, saying &quot;we must make this organisation work&quot;. General George Kenney represented the United States Air Force, and Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner the United States Navy. The MSC struggled to be organized; namely because no-one was willing to propose who the force would fight against.

At the first meeting in February 1946, operational procedures were established. Further discussions began in March in New York City. The US considered that the committee could oversee decolonization and border disputes, but was cautious that too much money was not spent and Congress retained war powers. The Soviet Union, fearing undue Western influence, was reluctant to participate in the MSC, and delegates had little negotiating power. Americans aimed to have the force active by June 1946, and proposed &quot;comparable strength&quot;, where permanent members of the UNSC keep forces at combat readiness, size would be based on the size of their armed forces.

Throughout 1946, American negotiators, particularly Kenney, attempted to compromise with the Soviets, but the Soviet Union would not negotiate, and the Americans (largely Turner and Ridgway) were inflexible on many points. Most other involved nations also expressed little interest; Turner stated that the &quot;US delegation has been the only delegation in the entire history of the Military Staff Committee to have made any specific proposals&quot;, besides one United Kingdom proposal. The British similarly felt that &quot;Russian intransigence&quot; was the cause of slow progress.

In September, the Soviet Union published a letter outlining their main objections to the American plan. However, by then the United States had largely given up hope for compromise. Debate was moved to the UNSC, and in a report titled MS/264 issued on April 30, 1947 by the MSC outlining proposals, differences were expressed between the Soviet Union and United States. However, the MSC unanimously agreed to more than half of the 41 articles in the report. Nations agreed the force would not be a standing army and that use would only be a last resort. All UN members were encouraged to contribute forces, facilities, or other assistance, though the majority of initial troops would come from the great powers. However, there were numerous disagreements as well. The Soviet Union demanded forces only be based in their nations and favored a more limited authority. The United States favored a larger force and comparable strength, whereas the Soviets proposed a smaller force with equal contributions. Mediation attempts repeatedly failed. The nations could not agree on leadership of the force, where bases would be located, and whether the MSC would be able to fight wars.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office noted in December 1947 that &quot;an unusual feature of this part of the work of the MSC is that agreement appears to have been brought, by normal standards of United Nations progress, unusually close. The prospect of success is however, more apparent than real. All these discussions presuppose agreement on the General Principles and such agreement remains remote.&quot; By August 1948, after conflicts such as the Berlin Blockade and 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état, and despite efforts at compromise by various people including US Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the MSC was essentially defunct.

=== Dormancy and reform efforts ===
United Nations peacekeeping began as early as 1948 under the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. The MSC was not considered to command troops in the Korean War, though it was fought by troops under the United Nations Command. In 1992, the United Nations Department of Peace Operations was established &quot;to provide political and executive direction to UN peacekeeping operations and maintain contact with the UNSC, troop and financial contributors, and parties to the conflict in the implementation of UNSC mandates.&quot; The United Nations Department of Field Support was established in 2008. Such organizations in the United Nations Secretariat supplanted the MSC&#x27;s role, and it currently functions in an advisory capacity to the UNSC. In 1982, Colonel Norman L. Dodd wrote that &quot;the Committee still meets once a month but the representatives of the Chiefs of Staff are of Colonel rank and nothing of substance is discussed or ever agreed.&quot;

British naval historian Eric Grove describes the MSC as &quot;a sterile monument to the faded hopes of the founders of the UN&quot;. Proposals for reviving the MSC have been presented. Grove wrote in 1993 that the negotiations the MSC underwent in 1947 and 1948 provide &quot;a starting point for considering the possibilities of the UN Charter operating as it was originally intended&quot; and &quot;the specific points of disagreement that prevented constructing a working system then are much less likely to cause problems now&quot;. In 1994, the author Kai Bird proposed a &quot;sizable standing UN army with troops from around the globe&quot;. Every two weeks the MSC meets, largely to set the date of its next meeting.

== Role ==
The role of the Military Staff Committee is to advise and assist the UN Security Council on all questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. The Committee&#x27;s recommendations and assistance were initially expected to be provided to the UN Security Council in the following areas:

* Actions requiring the use of military forces under article 42
* Agreements to provide military forces to the Security Council under articles 43 and 44
* The readiness of immediately available air force contingents for combined international enforcement action under article 45
* Planning for the application of armed force under article 46
* Formulating plans for the regulation of armaments under article 26

== Membership ==
The MSC is made up of the chiefs of staff of the military branches of the UNSC&#x27;s permanent members, represented by delegated representatives. The chairmanship of the MSC rotates in alphabetical order (by country name) at the beginning of each month through the representatives of the five permanent members.

Meetings of the Committee are held at the call of the chairman at any time they deems necessary, but the interval between meetings shall not exceed fourteen days. The Committee&#x27;s programme of work is prepared in advance and published in the UN Journal and on the Committee&#x27;s website.

<text>The Cotswold Line is an railway line between and in England.

==History==
===Early years===
The line between Oxford and Worcester was built under an 1845 Act of Parliament and opened in 1851 as part of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway.

The Act required the line to be built to Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge but delays, disputes and increasing costs led to its being completed as standard gauge.

The first stage of the Worcester and Hereford Railway opened between Henwick and Malvern Link on 25 July 1859. The bridge over the River Severn was approved for traffic the following year, and trains started running through from Malvern Link to Worcester Shrub Hill station on 17 May 1860. A short extension from Malvern Link to opened on 25 May 1860.

On 1 July 1860 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway absorbed both the Worcester &amp; Hereford Railway and the Newport, Abergavenny &amp; Hereford Railway to form the West Midland Railway.

On 13 September 1861 the final stage of the railway opened between Malvern Wells and Shelwick Junction. This junction is just north of Hereford station on the line between Hereford and Shrewsbury, and it finally created a through route between Worcester and Hereford.

The Great Western Railway took over the West Midland Railway in 1863.

The original tunnel through the ridge of the Malvern Hills, Colwall Tunnel, was completed in July 1860. However, the tunnel was unstable, and it was closed for short periods in 1861 and again in 1907 following rock falls. Eventually the GWR decided to build a new tunnel to the south of the existing one. This opened for traffic on 2 August 1926. The old tunnel was abandoned, and during World War II it was used to store torpedoes.

In the early 1970s, 25 miles from Moreton-in-Marsh to Norton Junction, Worcester were converted from double to single track.

Following serious floods, which washed parts of embankments away, the line was closed for about a fortnight during July and August 2007 for repairs.

===Improvement works 2008–2011===
Network Rail completed the redoubling of of track from just east of to , and from to about west of Evesham on 22 August 2011. This was intended to improve reliability, enable non-stop operations and allow an hourly off peak service to run on the line. The Office of Rail Regulation approved the work in June 2008, although the planned work was over-budget and had to await final approval. In December 2008 vegetation was cleared. A six-week closure of all or part of the line between Oxford and Worcester for preparatory works took place in July and August 2009. Further weekend work planned for February 2010 was postponed by Network Rail. Initial work began in autumn of 2010, with the majority of the second track being relaid between December 2010 and May 2011 when the line was closed at 21.30 from Monday to Thursday. In March 2011 construction works were started on additional structures and signalling equipment that the new line needed, including three new platforms at Charlbury, Ascott-under-Wychwood and . Footbridges at Charlbury and Honeybourne as well as preparation for the upgrade of six Level Crossings. The new double track section between Charlbury and Ascott re-opened on 6 June 2011; the line between Oxford and Moreton-in-Marsh having been closed during the previous nine days. The section between Moreton and Evesham reopened as double track on 22 August 2011 with the line closed for the preceding two weeks.

=== Platform extensions 2018 ===
The line was closed from 16 to 25 November 2018, between Moreton-In-Marsh and Worcester Shrub Hill, so that platforms could be extended to accommodate Class 800 trains.

=== Opening of Worcestershire Parkway 2020 ===
Worcestershire Parkway railway station opened in February 2020, following a long-standing proposal for a new split-level station where the line crosses over the Birmingham and Bristol Railway route. Connecting services are provided by CrossCountry on the Cardiff to Nottingham line and there is parking for 483 cars.

==Route==
The line comprises all or part of the following Network Rail routes:

*GW 200 from Oxford
*GW 310 from Wolvercot Junction
*GW 300 from Norton Junction
*GW 340 from Worcester Shrub Hill
*GW 730 from Shelwick Junction to Hereford

===Infrastructure===
The line is single track between the following places:
*Wolvercot Junction, (about north of Oxford) and .
* west of and Norton Junction ( south east of )
*Worcester Shrub Hill through to Henwick.
*Malvern Wells, ( south of ) and Shelwick Junction ( north of Hereford) with a crossing place at .

Other sections are double track.

Significant civil engineering structures on the line include Campden Tunnel (), the Colwall Tunnels (), Ledbury Tunnel () and viaducts at Worcester and Ledbury.

=== Detail===

====Oxford to Charlbury====
After departing Oxford station, the Cotswold Line shares track with the Cherwell Valley Line to Banbury. About north of the station, the line crosses the Sheepwash Channel which links the Castle Mill Stream and Oxford Canal with the River Thames. Immediately east of the current line is the Rewley Road Swing Bridge over the channel which used to carry the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s (LNWR) Buckinghamshire Railway line to its terminus at Oxford Rewley Road. The swing bridge is a listed building. The Rewley Road station building has been dismantled and re-erected at Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The built up area east of the railway, visible across the Oxford Canal, is Jericho, a district which originated as lodgings outside the city walls where travellers could rest if they arrived after the gates were locked. The Eagle Ironworks of William Lucy &amp; Co. was near the first road bridge over the track on Walton Well Road.

After the bridge, the open area to the left is Port Meadow, a water meadow bordering the Thames with a Bronze Age round barrow. The former LNWR Buckinghamshire Railway branches away to the north east. The section from Oxford to Bicester has been connected to the Chiltern Main Line by a new chord at Bicester, enabling through trains from Oxford to London Marylebone to run from September 2015. Proposals exist for re-opening the whole line and are included in the Draft Milton Keynes &amp; South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy, but there are many planning and funding matters to be resolved.

The line passes through Wolvercote. To the west, Lower Wolvercote was a centre for paper making, mainly for the Oxford University Press from the 17th century until 1998 and is the site of Godstow Abbey, a Benedictine convent founded in the 12th century. The line passes under the viaduct carrying the A34 Oxford Western Bypass and further under the A40 road linking London and Fishguard.
The line now turns west; here the former Buckinghamshire Junction Railway link with the Buckinghamshire Railway used to converge from the east. About after Oxford station, station was in the short stretch between here and where the Witney Railway diverged to the south-west. So far, the line has been close to the River Thames but the river now swings away to the south through a landscape dotted with gravel pits. The line now climbs the valley of the River Evenlode repeatedly crossing and re-crossing the river. station serves the villages of Long Hanborough, Church Hanborough, Freeland and Bladon. The Oxford Bus Museum is next to Hanborough station.

From Hanborough the line enters the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and beyond Hanborough is station. Building the line through Combe was difficult with several deep cuttings, four crossings of the Evenlode, and the diversion of a length of the river. To the south, just after the third river crossing are the remains of North Leigh Roman Villa. About beyond the villa the line crosses the course of Akeman Street Roman road. The Oxfordshire Way long-distance footpath follows Akeman Street from the north east to a point about north of the railway before turning to run through Stonesfield and meet the line at Charlbury station. The next station is . Between Finstock and Charlbury the deer park to the west of the line is Cornbury Park, original venue for the Cornbury Music Festival, which has now been replaced by the Wilderness Festival. The woodlands south west of the park are the remains of Wychwood Forest named after the Hwicce, one of the Anglo-Saxon peoples of Britain. Charlbury station is the start of the redoubled track and is first stop for faster trains over the line and retains its original Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway clapperboard building. Sir Peter Parker lived nearby at Minster Lovell and was a regular user of Charlbury station while chairman of the British Railways Board (1976 to 1983). The patronage of the head of the organisation may have helped to save the line at a time when the Serpell Report was calling for more rail closures. This is section of track has a maximum speed of 

====Charlbury to Moreton-in-Marsh====
The line is now heading south-west and the site of Ascot d&#x27;Oilly Castle is to the north-west as the train enters Ascott-under-Wychwood. Few trains call at station, but there is a signal box controlling the level crossing and the points that were formerly the end of the single track section from Wolvercot Junction. beyond Ascott is station which serves the villages of Shipton-under-Wychwood, Milton-under-Wychwood and Fifield.

Still following the Evenlode, the line now turns north-west. There is another level crossing near Bruern Abbey. The next junction on the line was at from where the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway went west to Cheltenham via and east to near . Kingham village is north of the station. The village west of the station is Bledington. The Oxfordshire Way which has been close to the railway since Akeman Street now turns west to Bourton-on-the-Water but it is replaced by another long-distance footpath, the Diamond Way. Beyond Kingham, the line passes through the site of the former railway station, closed in 1966. At Moreton-in-Marsh the line crosses the course of another major Roman road, the Fosse Way which linked &quot;Isca Dumnoniorum&quot; (Exeter) and &quot;Lindum Colonia&quot; (Lincoln). Moreton-in-Marsh was the headquarters of the railway spot-hire company Cotswold Rail until the company moved to Gloucester.

====Moreton-in-Marsh to Hereford====
About after Oxford is Moreton-in-Marsh. This was once the southern end of the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. The line then passes the corner of the Roman town of Dorn. The Cotswold Line leaves the Evenlode which drains into the Thames and enters the catchment of the River Severn. The first level crossing appears. The building west of the crossing is a brick works and the neighbouring pits were the site of Jurassic clay extraction for the works. The village to the north is Paxford. The large country house to the west is Northwick Park, former home of Edward Spencer-Churchill and site of a United States Army hospital during World War II and afterwards a centre for Polish refugees. The line the passes the site of station, about east of Chipping Campden itself. From here the line goes into cutting, then the Campden Tunnel under the Cotswold escarpment. In 1851 unrest among the navvies building the tunnel resulted in a riot – the &#x27;Battle of Campden Tunnel&#x27;.

The next station is Honeybourne. From 1905 until 1977 this was the junction with the GWR line between Cheltenham and . The track to the north remains as a link to the large former military depot at Long Marston. There is a good business case for the restoration of the Stratford-Cotswolds link. The large compound to the north with high walls, chapel, and floodlights is Long Lartin prison. There is another level crossing, where station used to be. The line crosses the River Avon into Evesham. Opposite Evesham&#x27;s Cotswold Line station is the former Midland Railway station, once on the Ashchurch &amp; Barnt Green line. The line becomes single track again about west of Evesham and then crosses the River Avon twice more and follows it towards .
West of Pershore, where the line crosses over the Cross Country Route, the new Worcestershire Parkway station has been opened. Just beyond, the line passes through Norton Junction where there was formerly a station. The junction links the line to the Cross Country Route. Here double track restarts.

About after Oxford is Worcester Shrub Hill station. Here are connections to commuter lines going to . Worcester Foregate Street station gives connections to the city centre and other lines to Birmingham. later the line reaches Malvern Link station. Great Malvern station follows, and later is the site of the former Malvern Wells station. After Malvern Wells the line enters the long Colwall New Tunnel. This is the second Colwall tunnel; the entrance to the original tunnel can be seen to the north. When the tunnel is below the ridge of the Malvern Hills, the line crosses the boundary between Worcestershire and Herefordshire. The line reaches Colwall station, where The Coca-Cola Company plant (now demolished) next to the station used to bottle Malvern Water, a local mineral water. Next to the bridge carrying the B4218 road over the railway is an unusual five-sided cottage. When the railway was built one corner had to be demolished and replaced by a plain wall. After passing through another tunnel, Ledbury station is passed and Hereford station ends the journey on the line.

==Services==
, the previous off peak weekday service continues: roughly an hourly service between London and Worcester. Due to constraints of the former single track, there are some two-hour gaps. These services are extensions of the half-hourly Oxford fast trains. Some of the former gaps have been partly filled by three additional trains as far as Moreton-in-Marsh (running through from/to London Paddington).

During peak hours, both Oxford fast trains are extended to Worcester, giving a half-hourly service. Overall, about half the trains continue to/from Great Malvern and five trains a day continue to and from Hereford.

There is also an additional commuter service to and from Oxford in the morning and evening, which additionally calls at the halts (their &quot;Parliamentary&quot; service, preventing their closure).

The historic problem of some trains having to wait at passing loops, extending journey times, has been eliminated by the redoubling, although some still have to wait at Charlbury or Evesham.

Due to short platforms, passengers alighting at stations except Shrub Hill, Worcestershire Parkway, Oxford and Hereford should listen to onboard announcements telling them from which coaches they should alight. Normally this is from the 2–5 coaches at the country end of the train (further from the ticket barrier at ).

In 2007 some trains in the morning rush hour started at but this was discontinued from December 2008.

==Usage==
The busiest stations on this line are the city stations at Oxford, Worcester and Hereford, followed by Great Malvern. The busiest station served exclusively by Great Western Railway&#x27;s Cotswold Line services is Moreton-in-Marsh, followed by Hanborough.

==Poetry==
The line features in two notable poems: &quot;Adlestrop&quot; by Edward Thomas and &quot;Pershore Station, or A Liverish Journey First Class&quot; by John Betjeman.

<text>Kent School is a private college-preparatory day and boarding school in Kent, Connecticut. Founded in 1906, it is affiliated with the Episcopal Church. It educates around 520 boys and girls in grades 9–12.

Kent was one of the first schools to provide tuition discounts based on what a family could afford to pay. The school&#x27;s list of notable alumni includes philosopher John Rawls, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, and three winners of the Pulitzer Prize.

== History ==

=== Founding and ethos ===
Kent School was founded by Anglo-Catholic Episcopal priest Frederick Herbert Sill in 1906. It arrived at the tail end of the wave of British-style boarding schools set up at the turn of the twentieth century. Sill admired England and wanted to spread English influence within the United States. The school was originally associated with the Anglican Benedictine Order of the Holy Cross, but gained its independence from the Order in 1943.

Although Kent has occasionally been categorized within Saint Grottlesex, a group of boarding schools with traditionally upper-class student bodies, the school advertises itself as &quot;an elite school, not a school for elites.&quot; Under Sill, Kent&#x27;s culture was egalitarian for its day. When Kent was founded, the Gilded Age had ended, and the New York elite that Sill expected to fund his school were either unwilling or unable to bankroll another prep school.

Sill realized that many of his students would have to come &quot;from families of moderate means who could not afford the tuition fees at the then established boarding schools of the [Episcopal] Church.&quot; To accommodate those families, he introduced a &quot;sliding-scale tuition model,&quot; a forerunner of today&#x27;s financial aid system, under which poor parents paid only what they could afford, and rich parents were asked to cover the difference. In 1927, the average tuition fee was $800, with parents contributing anything from $0 to $1,500. By contrast, that year, the St. Grottlesex schools all charged between $1,200 and $1,400.

Under Sill, all students, rich or poor, were required to help pay their own way by working on the school farm or doing school chores. Sill also discouraged rich students from flaunting their wealth, explaining that &quot;we [do not] object to fur coats as such, but to see school boys sporting fur coats ... strikes us as rather ostentatious.&quot; Kent was also said to have been &quot;more accommodating to those students who were drawn to creative pursuits than some of Kent&#x27;s counterparts.&quot;

Despite its humble beginnings, Kent established a strong reputation. Due to Sill&#x27;s desire to limit the student body to 300 students, the school&#x27;s waitlist became &quot;unmanageably long.&quot; To meet increasing demand, Sill established South Kent School in 1923. He retired in 1941 after a paralytic stroke, and died in 1952.

=== Development ===
Following Kent&#x27;s 1943 disassociation from the Order of the Holy Cross, the school retained its broader affiliation with the Episcopal Church. However, in the 1950s, it began allowing Catholic students to attend Sunday Mass in town. Today, attendance at Kent&#x27;s Episcopal Sunday chapel service is voluntary.

In 1954, Kent admitted its first African-American and Asian students. In addition, the school offered a scholarship to a black South African student in 1955. However, the apartheid-era South African government refused to grant the student a passport, causing an international incident.

The school established a coordinate girls&#x27; school in 1960, over a decade before the other St. Grottlesex schools adopted co-education. However, until 1992, girls occupied a separate campus nearly five miles away. When Kent began admitting girls, it dropped the sliding-scale tuition model and shifted to a more conventional financial aid system.

=== Present day ===
Richardson W. Schell &#x27;69 became headmaster in 1981 and led the school until 2020. When he arrived, Kent was in a period of transition. Under Sill, the school had been reliant on tuition (and Sill&#x27;s policy of simple living) to make ends meet. With the cost of education spiraling upwards, Kent ran budget deficits for much of the 1970s. In addition, Kent spent much of its financial endowment building the new girls&#x27; campus. When Schell took over, Kent&#x27;s endowment stood at $3 million ($10.4 million in May 2024 dollars).

Schell improved Kent&#x27;s financial position by raising a large endowment, which stood at $87 million in 2017. He also attracted wealthy international students; at Kent, international students typically pay full tuition, although some scholarships may be awarded. Under Schell, the percentage of international students at Kent increased roughly fourfold, doubling to 15.5% by 1996 and doubling again to 30% by 2015. As of the 2023–24 school year, Kent does not disclose its percentage of international students, but it states that its students come from 30 U.S. states and 34 countries. Although Kent&#x27;s increased revenues generally allowed the school to offer more robust financial aid to domestic students, the percentage of students on financial aid has fluctuated in recent years, shifting from 22% in 1999 to 43% in 2013, 29% in 2019, and 35% in 2023.

In 2020, Michael Hirschfeld was appointed Head of School. He was previously Kent&#x27;s assistant director of admissions in the 1990s, and most recently served as rector of St. Paul&#x27;s School in New Hampshire. The student body shrunk during the COVID-19 pandemic, dropping from 580 students in 2020 to 504 in 2021. Since 2022, enrollment has held steady at 520 students. The school&#x27;s strategic plan states that its near-term priorities are to &quot;move toward 50% of students on financial aid,&quot; to maintain the boarding student population at 470, and to improve the school dormitories and faculty housing.

In the 2021–22 school year, Kent enrolled 80 freshmen (in school jargon, &quot;Third Formers&quot;), 125 sophomores (&quot;Fourth Formers&quot;), 149 juniors (&quot;Fifth Formers&quot;), and 150 seniors and post-graduate students (&quot;Sixth Formers&quot; and &quot;PGs&quot;), for a total enrollment of 504 students. Of these 504 students, Kent reported that 289 were white (57.3%), 134 were Asian (26.6%), 24 were black (4.8%), 24 were Hispanic (4.8%), and 33 were multiracial (6.5%); the survey did not allow Kent to classify students in two or more categories, or to distinguish between domestic and international students.

== Academics ==
Kent follows a trimester system in which a school year is fall, winter, and spring terms. Classes are held from Monday to Saturday, with Wednesdays and Saturdays being half-days to accommodate athletic contests and other after-school activities. The school has announced that it intends to phase out Advanced Placement classes and to replace them with Kent-designed &quot;Advanced Studies&quot; classes.

Kent grades students on an unweighted 4.0 GPA scale, but does not rank students or calculate a student&#x27;s cumulative GPA. Students in the Class of 2023 had an average SAT score of 1313 and an average ACT score of 28.1.

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2023–24 school year, Kent charged boarding students $73,450 and day students $54,600, plus other optional and mandatory fees. 35% of students received financial aid, which covered, on average, $54,000.

=== Endowment and expenses ===
In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2022–23 school year, Kent reported total assets of $214.9 million, net assets of $167.4 million, investment holdings of $132.2 million, and cash holdings of $17.8 million. Kent also reported $38.5 million in program service expenses and $6.8 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

===Crew===

The Kent School Boat Club was begun at Kent in 1922 with the encouragement of Father Sill. Sill was the coxswain of the Columbia crew which won the first ever Poughkeepsie Regatta.

Kent competed for the Thames Challenge Cup in 1933 with the support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who sent a letter to Sill offering his &quot;good wishes for a successful trip&quot; and commenting on how &quot;the presence of a crew of American school boys will be helpful in strengthening the ties between good sportsmen of the two countries.&quot; That year, Kent won the Thames Challenge Cup. The Times in Britain wrote, &quot;Kent School were almost certainly the best crew that ever rowed in the Thames Cup.&quot; Kent competed at Henley 32 times and won 5 times, most recently in 1972. The school was featured twice in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, once in May 1937 and again in June 1948. Stuart Auchincloss &#x27;48 was featured on the cover of the latter publication. Kent Boys Crew also won the New England Championship Regatta 25 times since 1947.

The girls team began in 1973. They won Henley in 2002 and two National Championships in 1986 and 1987. They have also won the New England Championship Regatta seven different times, including four of the first five times, it competed for it.

In 2006, Kent Boys Crew won the New England championship and became the first American crew to challenge for the recently established Prince Albert Challenge Cup at Henley. In 2010, Kent Boys Crew won the New England points trophy and placed 1st at Youth Nationals. The team traveled to Henley and were the runners-up for the Princess Elizabeth Cup, losing to Eton College.

====Honors====
* Henley Royal Regatta, Thames Challenge Cup 1933, 1938, 1947, 1950
* Henley Royal Regatta, Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup 1972

===Football===
Football at Kent competes in the Housatonic Valley League. In the past 17 years, the team has earned seven league championships and two New England Championships.

=== Squash ===
In 2021–22, the Kent Boys&#x27; squash team won its first boys national title after a 4–3 final against three-time defending champions Brunswick.

==Controversies==

Following the 1999 premiere of Seth MacFarlane (class of 1991) animated TV sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Kent headmaster Richardson Schell urged Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s advertisers to cancel their advertising with the show. He called its brand of humor &quot;obnoxious&quot; and said that some of its jokes were racist. He also questioned whether the name of the show&#x27;s dysfunctional Griffin family was a personal insult to his secretary, who was also named Griffin. Reportedly, Schell helped persuade companies like Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, KFC, and Sprint to withdraw their advertising from the show. MacFarlane&#x27;s mother, who had worked at the school for 22 years, resigned in protest. In 2022 (two years after Schell&#x27;s retirement) Kent awarded MacFarlane its alumni achievement award. To commemorate the occasion, the school commissioned a Kent student to create a video in which MacFarlane&#x27;s friends and family recounted episodes from his childhood.
In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on a lawsuit alleging that Kent School failed to report alleged sexual misconduct by a faculty member toward a 15-year-old student in 1987 and 1988. The report came on the heels of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight&quot; team revealing decades of alleged sexual abuse at numerous New England prep schools and alleged retaliation for student complaints. The reporters noted faculty alleged as abusers being relocated to different schools, including Kent.

<text>Willie Gathrel Hefner (April 11, 1930 – September 2, 2009), was an American radio personality and Democratic U.S. Congressman from North Carolina, serving between 1975 and 1999.

==Life and career==
Born in Elora, Tennessee, Hefner graduated from high school in Sardis, Alabama. He attended the University of Alabama, and he became the president and owner of radio station WRKB in Kannapolis, North Carolina. He was a member of the Harvesters Quartet, a group of gospel music singers based in North Carolina, from 1954 to 1967, and was a television performer on numerous North Carolina TV channels.

In 1974, he was elected as a Democrat to the 94th United States Congress; he served a total of 12 terms, from January 3, 1975, until January 3, 1999, when he retired from Congress.

Hefner built a reputation as an advocate for veterans, and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salisbury, North Carolina, was renamed in his honor on April 16, 1999.

After retiring from Congress, Hefner moved with his wife, Nancy, to Alabama. He served from October 2001 until November 2002 as the District One commissioner for Marshall County, Alabama. He died in Huntsville, Alabama, on September 2, 2009, after suffering a brain aneurysm.

<doc id="1189417" wikidata="Q2730433" url="?curid=1189417" title="Cream (colour)">
<text>Cream is the colour of the cream produced by cattle grazing on natural pasture with plants rich in yellow carotenoid pigments, some of which are incorporated into the fresh milk (specifically, the butterfat). This gives a yellow tone to otherwise-white milk at higher fat concentrations (so the colour of dairy cream could be considered partway between the colours of natural cow&#x27;s milk and butter). Cream is the pastel colour of yellow, much as pink is to red. By mixing yellow and white, cream can be produced.

The first recorded use of &quot;cream&quot; as a colour name in English was in 1590.

==In nature==
Birds
* The cream-coloured courser
* The cream-coloured woodpecker

Mammals
* The cream-coloured giant squirrel

==In human culture==

===Art===
* Cream is used as a skin tone in some forms of art, mostly anime. It is also used to describe the general skin tone of East and South East Asia.

===Clothing===
* Men&#x27;s white tuxedo jackets are usually a shade of cream or ivory to better stand out against the white dress shirt.

===Interior design===
* The colour cream is widely used as one of the off-white colours in interior design.

===Sports===
* The Indiana University Bloomington Hoosiers&#x27; official colours are cream and crimson.
* The University of Nebraska Cornhuskers&#x27; official colours are scarlet and cream.
*The University of Oklahoma Sooners&#x27; official colours are crimson and cream.
*Club América&#x27;s original colours are cream and blue, before switching to yellow and blue.
*Universitario de Deportes&#x27; official colours are cream and burgundy.
*Sport Club Corinthians Paulista&#x27;s first uniform featured cream shirts before switching definitively to white shirts (due to a washing up error), which were kept since then.

<doc id="1189425" wikidata="Q837274" url="?curid=1189425" title="Van Emde Boas tree">
<text>A van Emde Boas tree (), also known as a vEB tree or van Emde Boas priority queue, is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with -bit integer keys. It was invented by a team led by Dutch computer scientist Peter van Emde Boas in 1975. It performs all operations in time (assuming that an formula_1 bit operation can be performed in constant time), or equivalently in formula_2 time, where formula_3 is the largest element that can be stored in the tree. The parameter formula_4 is not to be confused with the actual number of elements stored in the tree, by which the performance of other tree data-structures is often measured. 

The standard vEB tree has inadequate space efficiency. For example, for storing 32-bit integers (i.e., when formula_5), it requires formula_6 bits of storage. However, similar data structures with equally good time efficiency and space efficiency of formula_7 (where formula_8 is the number of stored elements) exist, and vEB trees can be modified to require only formula_9 space. 

==Supported operations==
A vEB supports the operations of an &quot;ordered associative array&quot;, which includes the usual associative array operations along with two more &quot;order&quot; operations, &quot;FindNext&quot; and &quot;FindPrevious&quot;:
*&quot;Insert&quot;: insert a key/value pair with an -bit key
*&quot;Delete&quot;: remove the key/value pair with a given key
*&quot;Lookup&quot;: find the value associated with a given key
*&quot;FindNext&quot;: find the key/value pair with the smallest key which is greater than a given 
*&quot;FindPrevious&quot;: find the key/value pair with the largest key which is smaller than a given 

A vEB tree also supports the operations &quot;Minimum&quot; and &quot;Maximum&quot;, which return the minimum and maximum element stored in the tree respectively. These both run in formula_10 time, since the minimum and maximum element are stored as attributes in each tree.

==Function==

 Let formula_11 for some integer formula_12. Define formula_3. A vEB tree over the universe formula_14 has a root node that stores an array of length formula_15. is a pointer to a vEB tree that is responsible for the values formula_16. Additionally, &quot;T&quot; stores two values and as well as an auxiliary vEB tree .

Data is stored in a vEB tree as follows: The smallest value currently in the tree is stored in and largest value is stored in . Note that is not stored anywhere else in the vEB tree, while is. If &quot;T&quot; is empty then we use the convention that and . Any other value formula_17 is stored in the subtree where formula_18. The auxiliary tree keeps track of which children are non-empty, so contains the value formula_19 if and only if is non-empty.

===FindNext===

The operation that searches for the successor of an element &quot;x&quot; in a vEB tree proceeds as follows: If then the search is complete, and the answer is . If then the next element does not exist, return M. Otherwise, let formula_18. If , then the value being searched for is contained in , so the search proceeds recursively in . Otherwise, we search for the successor of the value &quot;i&quot; in . This gives us the index &quot;j&quot; of the first subtree that contains an element larger than &quot;x&quot;. The algorithm then returns . The element found on the children level needs to be composed with the high bits to form a complete next element.

 function FindNext(T, x)
 if x &lt; T.min then
 return T.min
 if x ≥ T.max then &quot;// no next element&quot;
 return M
 i = floor(x/formula_15)
 lo = x mod formula_15
 if lo &lt; T.children[i].max then
 return (formula_15 i) + FindNext(T.children[i], lo)
 j = FindNext(T.aux, i)
 return (formula_15 j) + T.children[j].min
 end

Note that, in any case, the algorithm performs formula_10 work and then possibly recurses on a subtree over a universe of size formula_26 (an formula_27 bit universe). This gives a recurrence for the running time of formula_28, which resolves to formula_29.

===Insert===

The call that inserts a value into a vEB tree operates as follows:

# If &quot;T&quot; is empty then we set and we are done.
# Otherwise, if then we insert into the subtree responsible for and then set . If was previously empty, then we also insert into 
# Otherwise, if then we insert into the subtree responsible for and then set . If was previously empty, then we also insert into 
# Otherwise, so we insert into the subtree responsible for . If was previously empty, then we also insert into .

In code:
 function Insert(T, x)
 if T.min == x || T.max == x then &quot;// x is already inserted&quot;
 return
 if T.min &gt; T.max then &quot;// T is empty&quot;
 T.min = T.max = x;
 return
 if x &lt; T.min then
 swap(x, T.min)
 if x &gt; T.max then
 T.max = x
 i = floor(x / formula_15)
 lo = x mod formula_15
 Insert(T.children[i], lo)
 if T.children[i].min == T.children[i].max then
 Insert(T.aux, i)
 end

The key to the efficiency of this procedure is that inserting an element into an empty vEB tree takes time. So, even though the algorithm sometimes makes two recursive calls, this only occurs when the first recursive call was into an empty subtree. This gives the same running time recurrence of as before.

===Delete===

Deletion from vEB trees is the trickiest of the operations. The call that deletes a value &quot;x&quot; from a vEB tree T operates as follows:

# If then &quot;x&quot; is the only element stored in the tree and we set and to indicate that the tree is empty.
# Otherwise, if then we need to find the second-smallest value &quot;y&quot; in the vEB tree, delete it from its current location, and set . The second-smallest value &quot;y&quot; is , so it can be found in time. We delete &quot;y&quot; from the subtree that contains it.
# If and then we delete x from the subtree that contains &quot;x&quot;.
# If then we will need to find the second-largest value &quot;y&quot; in the vEB tree and set . We start by deleting x as in previous case. Then value &quot;y&quot; is either or , so it can be found in time.
# In any of the above cases, if we delete the last element &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; from any subtree then we also delete &quot;i&quot; from .

In code:
 function Delete(T, x)
 if T.min == T.max == x then
 T.min = M
 T.max = −1
 return
 if x == T.min then
 hi = T.aux.min * formula_15
 j = T.aux.min
 T.min = x = hi + T.children[j].min
 i = floor(x / formula_15)
 lo = x mod formula_15
 Delete(T.children[i], lo)
 if T.children[i] is empty then
 Delete(T.aux, i)
 if x == T.max then
 if T.aux is empty then
 T.max = T.min
 else
 hi = T.aux.max * formula_15
 j = T.aux.max
 T.max = hi + T.children[j].max
 end

Again, the efficiency of this procedure hinges on the fact that deleting from a vEB tree that contains only one element takes only constant time. In particular, the second Delete call only executes if &quot;x&quot; was the only element in prior to the deletion.

===In practice===

The assumption that is an integer is unnecessary. The operations formula_36 and formula_37 can be replaced by taking only higher-order and the lower-order bits of , respectively. On any existing machine, this is more efficient than division or remainder computations.

In practical implementations, especially on machines with &quot;shift-by-k&quot; and &quot;find first zero&quot; instructions, performance can further be improved by switching to a bit array once equal to the word size (or a small multiple thereof) is reached. Since all operations on a single word are constant time, this does not affect the asymptotic performance, but it does avoid the majority of the pointer storage and several pointer dereferences, achieving a significant practical savings in time and space with this trick.

An optimization of vEB trees is to discard empty subtrees. This makes vEB trees quite compact when they contain many elements, because no subtrees are created until something needs to be added to them. Initially, each element added creates about new trees containing about pointers all together. As the tree grows, more and more subtrees are reused, especially the larger ones. In a full tree of elements, only space is used. Moreover, unlike a binary search tree, most of this space is being used to store data: even for billions of elements, the pointers in a full vEB tree number in the thousands.

The implementation described above uses pointers and occupies a total space of , proportional to the size of the key universe. This can be seen as follows. The recurrence is formula_38.
Resolving that would lead to formula_39.
One can, fortunately, also show that by induction.

== Similar structures ==

The space usage of vEB trees is an enormous overhead unless a large fraction of the universe of keys is being stored. This is one reason why vEB trees are not popular in practice. This limitation can be addressed by changing the array used to store children to another data structure. One possibility is to use only a fixed number of bits per level, which results in a trie. Alternatively, each array may be replaced by a hash table, reducing the space to (where is the number of elements stored in the data structure) at the expense of making the data structure randomized.

x-fast tries and the more complicated y-fast tries have comparable update and query times to vEB trees and use randomized hash tables to reduce the space used. x-fast tries use space while y-fast tries use space.

Fusion trees are another type of tree data structure that implements an associative array on w-bit integers on a finite universe. They use word-level parallelism and bit manipulation techniques to achieve time for predecessor/successor queries and updates, where is the word size. Fusion trees use space and can be made dynamic with hashing or exponential trees.

== Implementations ==
There is a verified implementation in Isabelle (proof assistant). Both functional correctness and time bounds are proved.
Efficient imperative Standard ML code can be generated.

<doc id="1189432" wikidata="Q203036" url="?curid=1189432" title="Rafael del Riego">
<text>Rafael del Riego y Flórez (7 April 1784 – 7 November 1823) was a Spanish general and liberal politician, who played a key role in the establishment of the Liberal Triennium (&quot;Trienio liberal&quot; in Spanish). He led the rebellion that bears his name, which ultimately contributed to the definitive loss of the Spanish Empire in the Americas.

== Early life ==
Riego was born on 7 April 1784 (according to other sources 24 November 1785) in Tuña, Tineo in Asturias. After graduating from the University of Oviedo in 1807, he moved to Madrid, where he joined the army.

== Peninsular War ==
In 1808, during the Spanish War of Independence he was taken captive by the French and imprisoned in El Escorial, from where he eventually escaped.

On 10 November he took part in the Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros, after which he once again was taken prisoner. Three days later he was sent to France, and, after he changed his name to &quot;Riego&quot; (without the &quot;del&quot;), was eventually released. He traveled around England and the German states, and in 1814 he returned to Spain, right before the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was abolished by Fernando VII. In Spain, Riego once again joined the army with a rank of lieutenant colonel and took an oath to the Constitution. During the six years of absolutism that followed the restoration of King Fernando VII, Spanish liberals wished to restore the Spanish Constitution, which the King had abolished in May 1814. Riego joined the freemasons and collaborated with liberals in several conspiracies against the King, which failed.

== 1820 revolt ==
In 1819, the King was assembling the most significant fleet and army to fight in the Spanish American wars of independence. Riego was given command of the Asturian Battalion. After arriving in Cádiz, together with other liberal officers, he started a mutiny of the entire army on 1 January 1820, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution.

Riego&#x27;s troops marched through the cities of Andalusia with the hope of starting an anti-absolutist uprising, but the local population was mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, took place in Galicia, and it quickly spread throughout Spain. On 7 March 1820, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Francisco Ballesteros, and on 10 March, the King agreed to restore the Constitution.

== Later life ==
The new progressive government promoted Riego to field marshal and made him Captain General of Galicia. On 8 January 1821 he took command of Aragon, and moved to Zaragoza. On 18 June, he married his cousin Maria Teresa del Riego y Bustillos. On 4 September 1821, because of a failed republican revolt, he was wrongly accused of republicanism and imprisoned.

However, his popularity grew, and demonstrations took place in Madrid demanding his release. In March 1822, he was elected to the Cortes Generales and eventually released from prison.

In December 1822, at the Congress of Verona, the Quintuple Alliance countries decided that a Spain that was bordering on republicanism was a threat to the balance of Europe, and France was chosen to force a restoring of the absolute monarchy in Spain.

On 7 April 1823, the French army crossed over the Pyrennes. Riego took command of the Third Army and resisted the invaders as well as local absolutist groups. On 15 September he was betrayed and taken prisoner in a country estate near the village of Arquillos, Jaén. He was taken to Madrid. Despite asking for clemency from the King, having approached religion and repented of his &quot;constitutional crimes&quot; during his imprisonment, completely retracting at the last minute his political convictions to the delight of the absolutists, Riego was found guilty of high treason against altar and throne, as he was one of the members of parliament who voted in favor of taking the power from the King. On 7 November 1823, he was hanged at La Cebada Square in Madrid.

== Memory ==
&quot;El Himno de Riego&quot;, a song written in honour of Riego, became the anthem of the First (1873–1874) and Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). Currently his portrait is displayed in the building of the Cortes Generales.

<text>==History==
The earliest evidence found of the old state road system is on a 1917 State Road Department map; in 1923 the Florida State Legislature began writing the routes into law. Every two years, when the legislature met, new roads were added, at first by number, and later giving the SRD the ability to choose a number. Many routes, specifically SR 2, had not only a main route, but spurs and loops to different places. These were mostly caused by the legislature. Even when a road was also a U.S. Highway, the State Road number was signed.

Up to and including 1939, every road written into law by the legislature was given a number by the SRD. This included the range from SR 397 to SR 449, which included most of the 1926 Bond Issue Roads in Orange County and some other major roads. The 1939 numbering ended with SR 545; 546 to 549 were skipped.

In 1941, many laws were passed assigning not only the main roads, as had been done in Orange County, but a lot of minor roads, to the State Road System in many counties. FDOT did not give these all numbers. Information about which were assigned is sparse. Very few roads were added in 1943 and 1945 due to World War II; the system got to at least SR 625, added in 1945. A state law passed in 1941 authorized a renumbering; this didn&#x27;t happen until 1945, also because of the war.

==Table==
Not all routes after 545 are in the table, since that information is much more limited.

<doc id="1189445" wikidata="Q1931968" url="?curid=1189445" title="Stereotactic surgery">
<text>Stereotactic surgery is a minimally invasive form of surgical intervention that makes use of a three-dimensional coordinate system to locate small targets inside the body and to perform on them some action such as ablation, biopsy, lesion, injection, stimulation, implantation, radiosurgery (SRS), etc.

In theory, any organ system inside the body can be subjected to stereotactic surgery. However, difficulties in setting up a reliable frame of reference (such as bone landmarks, which bear a constant spatial relation to soft tissues) mean that its applications have been, traditionally and until recently, limited to brain surgery. Besides the brain, biopsy and surgery of the breast are done routinely to locate, sample (biopsy), and remove tissue. Plain X-ray images (radiographic mammography), computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to guide the procedure.

Another accepted form of &quot;stereotactic&quot; is &quot;stereotaxic&quot;. The word roots are &quot;&quot;, a prefix derived from the Greek word στερεός (&quot;stereos&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;), and &quot;-taxis&quot; (a suffix of Neo-Latin and ISV, derived from Greek &quot;taxis&quot;, &quot;arrangement&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, from &quot;tassein&quot;, &quot;to arrange&quot;).

==Uses==
The surgery is used to treat various brain cancers, benign, and functional disorders of the brain. This is sometimes combined with whole brain radiotherapy, and a 2021 systematic review found this combination led to the greatest improvement of survival for those with single brain metastasis. 

Amongst the malignant brain disorders are: brain metastasis and glioblastoma. The benign brain disorders are: meningioma, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, vestibular schwannoma, and pituitary adenoma. Functional disorders are: trigeminal neuralgia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and epilepsy.

==Procedure==
Stereotactic surgery works on the basis of three main components:
* A stereotactic planning system, including atlas, multimodality image matching tools, coordinates calculator, etc.
* A stereotactic device or apparatus
* A stereotactic localization and placement procedure

Modern stereotactic planning systems are computer based. The stereotactic atlas is a series of cross sections of anatomical structure (for example, a human brain), depicted in reference to a two-coordinate frame. Thus, each brain structure can be easily assigned a range of three coordinate numbers, which will be used for positioning the stereotactic device. In most atlases, the three dimensions are: latero-lateral (), dorso-ventral () and rostro-caudal ().

The stereotactic apparatus uses a set of three coordinates (, and ) in an orthogonal frame of reference (cartesian coordinates), or, alternatively, a cylindrical coordinates system, also with three coordinates: angle, depth and antero-posterior (or axial) location. The mechanical device has head-holding clamps and bars which puts the head in a fixed position in reference to the coordinate system (the so-called zero or origin). In small laboratory animals, these are usually bone landmarks which are known to bear a constant spatial relation to soft tissue. For example, brain atlases often use the external auditory meatus, the inferior orbital ridges, the median point of the maxilla between the incisive teeth. or the bregma (confluence of sutures of frontal and parietal bones), as such landmarks. In humans, the reference points, as described above, are intracerebral structures which are clearly discernible in a radiograph or tomograph. In newborn human babies, the &quot;soft spot&quot; where the coronal and sagittal sutures meet (known as the fontanelle) becomes the bregma when this gap closes.

Guide bars in the , and directions (or alternatively, in the polar coordinate holder), fitted with high precision vernier scales allow the neurosurgeon to position the point of a probe (an electrode, a cannula, etc.) inside the brain, at the calculated coordinates for the desired structure, through a small trephined hole in the skull.

Currently, a number of manufacturers produce stereotactic devices fitted for neurosurgery in humans, for both brain and spine procedures, as well as for animal experimentation.

=== Types frame systems ===

# Simple orthogonal system: The probe is directed perpendicular to a square base unit fixed to the skull. These provide three degrees of freedom by means of a carriage that moved orthogonally along the base plate or along a bar attached parallel to the base plate of the instrument. Attached to the carriage was a second track that extended across the head frame perpendicularly.
# Burr hole mounted system: This provides a limited range of possible intracranial target points with a fixed entry point. They provided two angular degrees of freedom and a depth adjustment. The surgeon could place the burr hole over nonessential brain tissue and utilize the instrument to direct the probe to the target point from the fixed entry point at the burr hole.
# Arc-quadrant systems: Probes are directed perpendicular to the tangent of an arc (which rotates about the vertical axis) and a quadrant (which rotates about the horizontal axis). The probe, directed to a depth equal to the radius of the sphere defined by the arc-quadrant, will always arrive at the center or focal point of that sphere.
# Arc-phantom systems: An aiming bow attaches to the head ring, which is fixed to the patient&#x27;s skull, and can be transferred to a similar ring that contains a simulated target. In this system, the phantom target is moved on the simulator to 3D coordinates. After adjusting the probe holder on the aiming bow so that the probe touches the desired target on the phantom, the transferable aiming bow is moved from the phantom base ring to the base ring on the patient. The probe is then lowered to the determined depth in order to reach the target point deep in the patient&#x27;s brain.

==Treatment==

===Stereotactic radiosurgery===

Stereotactic radiosurgery utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets in the head or spine without the need to make an incision. This concept requires steep dose gradients to reduce injury to adjacent normal tissue while maintaining treatment efficacy in the target. As a consequence of this definition, the overall treatment accuracy should match the treatment planning margins of 1–2 mm or better. To use this paradigm optimally and treat patients with the highest possible accuracy and precision, all errors, from image acquisition over treatment planning to mechanical aspects of the delivery of treatment and intra-fraction motion concerns, must be systematically optimized. To assure quality of patient care the procedure involves a multidisciplinary team consisting of a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, and radiation therapist. Dedicated, commercially available stereotactic radiosurgery programs are provided by the irrespective Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, and Novalis Radiosurgery devices.

Stereotactic radiosurgery provides an efficient, safe, and minimal invasive treatment alternative for patients diagnosed with malignant, benign and functional indications in the brain and spine, including but not limited to both primary and secondary tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a well-described management option for most metastases, meningiomas, schwannomas, pituitary adenomas, arteriovenous malformations, and trigeminal neuralgia, among others.

Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy and although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications, the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different. The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the total accumulated radiation dose. Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of radiobiology: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation. Today, both treatment techniques are complementary as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.

A second, more recent evolution extrapolates the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery to extra-cranial targets, most notably in the lung, liver, pancreas, and prostate. This treatment approach, entitled stereotactic body radiotherapy or SBRT, is challenged by various types of motion. On top of patient immobilization challenges and the associated patient motion, extra-cranial lesions move with respect to the patient&#x27;s position due to respiration, bladder and rectum filling. Like stereotactic radiosurgery, the intent of stereotactic body radiotherapy is to eradicate a defined extra-cranial target. However, target motion requires larger treatment margins around the target to compensate for the positioning uncertainty. This in turn implies more normal tissue exposed to high doses, which could result in negative treatment side effects. As a consequence, stereotactic body radiotherapy is mostly delivered in a limited number of fractions, thereby blending the concept of stereotactic radiosurgery with the therapeutic benefits of fractionated radiotherapy. To monitor and correct target motion for accurate and precise patient positioning prior and during treatment, advanced image-guided technologies are commercially available and included in the radiosurgery programs offered by the CyberKnife and Novalis communities.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===

Functional neurosurgery comprises treatment of several disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, hyperkinesia, disorder of muscle tone, intractable pain, convulsive disorders and psychological phenomena. Treatment for these phenomena was believed to be located in the superficial parts of the CNS and PNS. Most of the interventions made for treatment consisted of cortical extirpation.
To alleviate extra pyramidal disorders, pioneer Russell Meyers dissected or transected the head of the caudate nucleus in 1939, and part of the putamen and globus pallidus.
Attempts to abolish intractable pain were made with success by transection of the spinothalamic tract at spinal medullary level and further proximally, even at mesencephalic levels.

In 1939-1941 Putnam and Oliver tried to improve Parkinsonism and hyperkinesias by trying a series of modifications of the lateral and antero-lateral cordotomies. Additionally, other scientists like Schurman, Walker, and Guiot made significant contributions to functional neurosurgery. In 1953, Cooper discovered by chance that ligation of the anterior chorioidal artery resulted in improvement of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Similarly, when Grood was performing an operation in a patient with Parkinson&#x27;s, he accidentally lesioned the thalamus. This caused the patient&#x27;s tremors to stop. From then on, thalamic lesions became the target point with more satisfactory results.

More recent clinical applications can be seen in surgeries used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease, such as Pallidotomy or Thalamotomy (lesioning procedures), or Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). During DBS, an electrode is placed into the thalamus, the pallidum of the subthalmamic nucleus, parts of brain that are involved in motor control, and are affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The electrode is connected to a small battery operated stimulator that is placed under the collarbone, where a wire runs beneath the skin to connect it to the electrode in the brain. The stimulator produces electrical impulses that affect the nerve cells around the electrode and should help alleviate tremors or symptoms that are associated with the affected area.

In Thalamotomy, a needle electrode is placed into the thalamus, and the patient must cooperate with tasks assigned to find the affected area- after this area of the thalamus is located, a small high frequency current is applied to the electrode and this destroys a small part of the thalamus. Approximately 90% of patients experience instantaneous tremor relief.

In Pallidotomy, an almost identical procedure to thalamotomy, a small part of the pallidum is destroyed and 80% of patients see improvement in rigidity and hypokinesia and a tremor relief or improvement comes weeks after the procedure.

==History==
The stereotactic method was first published in 1908 by two British scientists, Victor Horsley, a physician and neurosurgeon, and Robert H. Clarke, a physiologist and was built by Swift &amp; Son; the two scientists stopped collaborating after the 1908 publication. The Horsley–Clarke apparatus used a Cartesian (three-orthogonal axis) system. That device is in the Science Museum, London; a copy was brought to the US by Ernest Sachs and is in the Department of Neurosurgery at UCLA. Clarke used the original to do research that led to publications of primate and cat brain atlases. There is no evidence it was ever used in a human surgery. The first stereotactic device designed for the human brain appears to have been an adaptation of the Horseley–Clarke frame built at Aubrey T. Mussen&#x27;s behest by a London workshop in 1918, but it received little attention and does not appear to have been used on people. It was a frame made of brass.

The first stereotactic device used in humans was used by Martin Kirschner, for a method to treat trigeminal neuralgia by inserting an electrode into the trigeminal nerve and ablating it. He published this in 1933.

In 1947 and 1949, two neurosurgeons working at Temple University in Philadelphia, Ernest A. Spiegel (who had fled Austria when the Nazis took over) and Henry T. Wycis, published their work on a device similar to the Horsley–Clarke apparatus in using a cartesian system; it was attached to the patient&#x27;s head with a plaster cast instead of screws. Their device was the first to be used for brain surgery; they used it for psychosurgery. They also created the first atlas of the human brain, and used intracranial reference points, generated by using medical images acquired with contrast agents.

The work of Spiegel and Wycis sparked enormous interest and research. In Paris, Jean Talairach collaborated with Marcel David, Henri Hacaen, and Julian de Ajuriaguerra on a stereotactic device, publishing their first work in 1949 and eventually developing the Talairach coordinates. In Japan, Hirotaro Narabayashi was doing similar work.

In 1949, Lars Leksell published a device that used polar coordinates instead of cartesian, and two years later he published work where he used his device to target a beam of radiation into a brain. Leksell&#x27;s radiosurgery system is also used by the Gamma Knife device, and by other neurosurgeons, using linear accelerators, proton beam therapy and neutron capture therapy. Lars Leksell went on to commercialize his inventions by founding Elekta in 1972.

In 1979, Russell A. Brown proposed a device, now known as the N-localizer, that enables guidance of stereotactic surgery using tomographic images that are obtained via medical imaging technologies such as X-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET). The N-localizer comprises a diagonal rod that spans two vertical rods to form an N-shape that allows tomographic images to be mapped to physical space. This device became almost universally adopted by the 1980s and is included in the Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW), Kelly-Goerss, Leksell, Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW), Micromar-ETM03B, FiMe-BlueFrame, Macom, and Adeor-Zeppelin stereotactic frames and in the Gamma Knife radiosurgery system. An alternative to the N-localizer is the Sturm-Pastyr localizer that is included in the Riechert-Mundinger and Zamorano-Dujovny stereotactic frames.

Other localization methods also exist that do not make use of tomographic images produced by CT, MRI, or PET, but instead conventional radiographs.

The stereotactic method has continued to evolve, and at present employs an elaborate mixture of image-guided surgery that uses computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and stereotactic localization.

== History in Latin America ==

In 1970, in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Aparatos Especiales company, produced the first Stereotactic System in Latin America. Antonio Martos Calvo, together with Jorge Candia and Jorge Olivetti through the request of neurosurgeon Jorge Schvarc (1942-2019), developed an equipment based on the principle of Hitchcock Stereotactic System. The patient was seated in an adapted chair with two telescopic arms attached at it base, which fixed the stereotactic frame preventing the patient’s movement. 

A double radiopaque ruler attached to the side of the frame made it possible to obtain the antero-posterior and latero-lateral X-ray images without the need of moving the radiopaque ruler. The thermal coagulation lesion was performed using tungsten monopole electrodes of 1,5mm of diameter (without temperature control) with a 3mm active tip, utilizing an electrical bipolar coagulator. The lesion size was previously determined by testing the electrode in egg albumin. Coagulation size was the result of the electrical coagulator power regulation and the application time of the radiofrequency. The first surgery performed with this system was a Trigeminal Nucleotractothomy. Jorge Schvarcz performed more than 700 functional surgeries until 1994 when, due to health problems he stopped exercising his profession. But the equipment developed kept improving on a neurosurgery history. 

This was the beginning of the developing of technology to produce stereotactic devices in Latin America. This was the beginning of the first stereotactic manufacturer of Latin America – The Brazilian Micromar. 

==Research==
Stereotactic surgery is sometimes used to aid in several different types of animal research studies. Specifically, it is used to target specific sites of the brain and directly introduce pharmacological agents to the brain which otherwise may not be able to cross the blood–brain barrier. In rodents, the main applications of stereotactic surgery are to introduce fluids directly to the brain or to implant cannulae and microdialysis probes. Site specific central microinjections are used when rodents do not need to be awake and behaving or when the substance to be injected has a long duration of action. For protocols in which rodents’ behaviors must be assessed soon after injection, stereotactic surgery can be used to implant a cannula through which the animal can be injected after recovery from the surgery. These protocols take longer than site-specific central injections in anesthetized mice because they require the construction of cannulae, wire plugs, and injection needles, but induce less stress in the animals because they allow for a recovery period for the healing of trauma induced to the brain before injection. Surgery can also be used for microdialysis protocols to implant and tether the dialysis probe and guide cannula.

<text>Alopecia universalis (AU), also known as alopecia areata universalis, is a medical condition involving the loss of all body hair, including eyebrows, eyelashes, chest hair, armpit hair, and pubic hair. It is the most severe form of alopecia areata (AA). People with the condition are usually healthy and have no other symptoms and a normal life expectancy.

==Causes==
Alopecia universalis can occur at any age, and is currently believed to be an autoimmune disorder, in which a person&#x27;s immune system attacks the hair follicles. Genetic factors may contribute to AU, as about 20% of those affected have a family member with alopecia.

==Treatment==
Many treatments have been explored, including immunomodulatory agents such as imiquimod. Tofacitinib citrate may also have benefits. In June 2014, a 25-year-old man with almost no hair on his body was reported to have grown a full head of hair, as well as eyebrows, eyelashes, and facial, armpit, and other hair, following eight months of treatment. However, there is no single accepted therapy, for which has systematically proven to be effective and for which the benefits would outweigh the costs (e.g., Tofacitinib is expensive and has side effects; treatment effects disappear with discontinuation of treatment). 

Contact immunotherapy involves the use of contact allergens, such as diphencyprone and squaric acid dibutylester, to induce an immune response that is thought to oppose the action of cells causing hair loss. A review that combined and analyzed the findings of 45 studies comprising 2,227 patients showed any hair regrowth in 54.5% and complete hair regrowth in 24.9% of patients with AT and AU using contact immunotherapy. In addition to its helpful effects in treating AU, it can have side effects that can be very serious, such as severe dermatitis.

Topical and intralesional corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, have also shown to be an effective treatment for AT and AU patients. A controlled study comprising 28 patients found positive terminal hair growth in eight of the patients (28.5%) using a 0.05% clobetasol propionate ointment. This is very similar to the results obtained from immunotherapy treatment trials. Additionally, studies suggest that intralesional applications are much more effective than topical applications of steroids. However, the main side effect is increased risk of cutaneous atrophy at the site of treatment; folliculitis is also an occasional complication.

Janus kinase inhibitors, previously used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases, such as arthritis, have successfully shown to be effective in the initial trials of treatment for alopecia patients. Multiple cases of treatments have been successful, one of them being of a 22-year-old man with a history of AU and atopic dermatitis (AD). This man was treated with JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and after ten months, he experienced hair regrowth on all of his affected body parts and subsequent improvement of his AD. Current research and findings suggest that systemic JAK inhibitors eliminate and prevent the development of AA, while topical JAK inhibitors promote hair regrowth and reverse the established disease. Many clinical trials are ongoing involving JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib and tofacitinib.

<text>The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) is Australia&#x27;s national environmental organisation, launched in 1965 in response to a proposal by the World Wide Fund for Nature for a more co-ordinated approach to sustainability. 

One high-profile campaign was &quot;Save the Whales&quot;, which ended commercial whaling in Australia, following widespread protest against the huge slaughter. Another was to protect the vulnerable Great Barrier Reef by classifying it as a marine park, from which mining, drilling and trawling were banned. By 2000, ACF initiatives extended across a wide range of agendas, such as climate change, clean energy, rainforest preservation, greenhouse pollution and land tenure reform in the Indigenous communities.
ACF is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit organisation focused on advocacy, policy, research and community organising, with a membership of 700,000. Its president, , is Mara Bún.

== Origins ==
Discussions regarding the need for an Australian conservation organisation originated in the 1960s through HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a founder of the World Wide Fund for Nature pivotal in establishment of the conservation movement in Australia. The head of the World Wide Fund, Philip Crowe, visited Australia in 1965 to advocate for more meaningful conservation action, recommending federal coordination, tax deductible donations for conservation and a national wildlife survey as three important measures. The Australian Conservation Foundation was established at a meeting of founders in Canberra, with the objective of supporting &quot;conservation policies and schemes that need special encouragement by whatever methods are most appropriate,&quot; with funding obtained by public appeal for &quot;material as well as moral support&quot; to its work. Sir Garfield Berwick was elected as the foundation president and governance was by a member-elected council. 

==Campaigns and programs==
The Australian Conservation Foundation campaigns on a wide range of environmental issues, including climate change, environmental law, clean energy, nuclear energy, economics, drivers of unsustainability, water management, and Indigenous land rights.

Campaigns and programs are selected predominantly for their capacity to contribute to reforms of national significance. This means that ACF tends not to become directly involved in local environmental issues, except where action on these contributes to achieving broader goals, such as highlighting examples of national problems or generating examples of solutions with larger potential. An example is the Stand up for Straddie campaign, which highlighted the effects of sand mining on Stradbroke Island. The organisation is acutely aware of its limited resources and strives to apply these strategically. This said, ACF is often called upon to comment on local issues and will often lend local environmental groups a helping hand. More often than not, ACF will work closely with other environmental groups – large or small – on the understanding that more can be achieved through co-operation. An example is ACF&#x27;s collaboration with The Wilderness Society and others on the Places You Love campaign and role in the Stop Adani alliance.

In August 2007, ACF launched a new campaign – Who on Earth Cares – with Cate Blanchett as its ambassador, aiming to provide online community spaces for people to show they care about climate change in Australia, and who want to see Australia reduce its greenhouse pollution. ACF joined a number of other Australian conservation organisations to launch the Places You Love campaign ahead of the September 2013 Federal election. The organisations are all concerned with the Council of Australian Government&#x27;s&#x27; proposals to wind back Australian environmental laws.

=== Successes ===

==== Ending commercial whaling in Australia ====
ACF pressed the Federal Government to lead a campaign for a worldwide ban to whaling and for an end to whaling in Australian waters. Thirty thousand supporters responded to a television advertising campaign to &#x27;Save the Whales&#x27;. In a 2004 speech to mark the 25-year anniversary of the end of this slaughter, former ACF president, Peter Garrett, described the ban on whaling – which came after examination of evidence from scientists and conservation groups that included the ACF and Project Jonah – as &quot;a critical moment for...the many Australians who were beginning to attach a greater significance to the protection of our natural world&quot;.

==== Mining prevented in Antarctica ====
ACF played a significant role in securing Antarctica&#x27;s conservation and protection. In 1989 the Hawke Government implemented a treaty to ban mining in Antarctica indefinitely.

==== Wet Tropics gains World Heritage listing ====
ACF campaigned for many years in the 1970s and 1980s to protect the Daintree Rainforests and achieve World Heritage status for the Wet Tropics area – a move that now protects around 900,000 hectares.

==== Koongarra gains World Heritage listing ====
The Koongarra area within Kakadu National Park was inscribed onto the World Heritage List in June 2011. ACF, with traditional owner Jeffrey Lee, worked persistently for over 30 years to have this area recognised and protected from mining.

==== The formation of Landcare ====
In 1989 ACF joined forces with the National Farmers&#x27; Federation (NFF) to launch Landcare – a grassroots movement dedicated to managing environmental issues in local communities across Australia. As of 2017, the Landcare movement is made up of more than 5,400 local groups across the nation.

==== Support for Cape York ====
Since 1975, ACF has been supporting a land tenure reform process with the twin aims of delivering land justice to Indigenous traditional owners, and protecting high conservation value lands across the Cape York Peninsula. Since 1995 the Cape York land tenure resolution process has returned more than three million hectares of land to Aboriginal ownership. This includes more than two million hectares of Aboriginal owned and jointly managed national parks and more than a million hectares of Aboriginal freehold.

==== The Climate Reality Project ====
The Climate Reality Project Australia, formed in 2006, ran in partnership with the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) until 2016. Since December 2016, it is hosted by the Melbourne Sustainability Society Institute. Founded by former US vice president Al Gore, the project has been successful in ensuring that one in 60 Australians have seen a presentation on the harmful effects of climate change and how they can work towards grassroots, worldwide solutions.

==== Protecting the Great Barrier Reef ====
Since its formation, ACF has protected the Great Barrier Reef from oil drilling, limestone mining, overfishing and trawling. In 1969, ACF kickstarted a Royal Commission which led to a ban on oil drilling on the reef. Six years later, after a national campaign by ACF and other community groups, the Australian government declared the Great Barrier Reef a national marine park. In the 1980s, the ACF community campaigned for the Reef&#x27;s World Heritage listing – and won. In the early 2000s, one of ACF&#x27;s greatest successes was in influencing the expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Over 3,500 submissions from ACF supporters to the Marine Park Authority saw environmentally protected areas of the reef increase from five per cent to one third of its expanse. More recently, ACF has sought to protect the reef through climate litigation, exemplified by their case against Woodside Energy regarding the Scarborough gas project, which aimed to address the potential climate impacts on the reef.

==== Jabiluka and Kakadu National Park ====
ACF and other environment groups worked closely with the Mirarr people to halt the Jabiluka uranium mine at Kakadu and the 1998 blockade gained significant media attention and put Jabiluka on the national and international agenda. This campaign took a big step forward when the Mirarr people and mining company ERA signed an agreement that gives the Mirarr a veto on any future development at the stalled Jabiluka mine-site. ACF Executive Director Don Henry described the decision as &quot;good news for Kakadu and a tribute to the power and persistence of the Mirarr and their many supporters&quot;.

==== Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change ====
The Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change released a report, The Business Case For Early Action, which showed that significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved at an affordable cost to the Australian economy – an important step in getting business and government support. ACF led the development of the Roundtable in 2006 – which included CEOs from BP Australia, Insurance Australia Group, Origin Energy, Swiss Re, Visy Industries, Westpac and ACF. The Roundtable commissioned CSIRO and the Allen Consulting Group to determine climate impacts on Australia and model the economic effects of a 60% reduction in emissions by 2050 and supported the call to act, and act early, on the important issue of climate change. The Report highlighted the fact that many Australian industries, including two of the nation&#x27;s largest export earners – agriculture and tourism – may be seriously impacted if action on climate change is delayed. Recommendations put forward by the Roundtable called for Australian Governments to work with business and the community to develop a policy framework that allows industry to respond effectively.

==== Creation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation ====
In December 2010 ACF released a report, Funding the transition to a clean energy economy, which assessed the tools used to support clean energy investment in other countries, and first put forward the blueprint for a $2 billion a year Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The $10 billion CEFC was accepted as part of the Clean Energy Future Package in July 2011, passing through parliament as law in June 2012.

==== People’s Climate March 2015 ====
In 2015, ACF led the People&#x27;s Climate March in Melbourne, which kicked off global marches around the world. The rally brought out more than 60,000 people and was the biggest march in the world that weekend.

=== Recent campaigns ===
====Stopping the Adani Carmichael coal mine====

In November 2015, ACF filed a case to challenge the federal government&#x27;s approval of Adani Mining&#x27;s Carmichael coal mine (&#x27;Carmichael case&#x27;) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (&#x27;EPBC Act). The purpose of the case was to highlight Australia&#x27;s failed environmental laws, Australia&#x27;s failure to act on climate change and to stop the Carmichael coal mine – a mine that would be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. ACF argued that in making his decision, the Environment Minister did not correctly or fully consider the impact or likely impact of pollution on the Great Barrier Reef from the coal burnt in India.

The hearings were held in Brisbane&#x27;s Federal Court on 3–4 May 2016 before Justice Griffiths. The Federal Court dismissed ACF&#x27;s challenge on Monday 29 August 2016. On 3 March, ACF went back to court to appeal the decision stating that the government was using the &quot;drug dealer’s defence&quot;. ACF is also a member of the StopAdani Alliance – a grassroots movement of local action groups working to build &quot;the biggest environmental movement in Australia’s history&quot; to stop Adani&#x27;s mine.

====Shifting to 100% clean energy====

In April 2016, ACF published &#x27;We love a sun-powered country&#x27;, a vision document urging the Australian federal government to commit to a national Clean Energy Transformation Plan to shift Australia to 100% clean energy by 2050; transition Australia away from coal, oil and gas; and increase energy efficiency. In the same month, ACF launched a Clean Energy Leadership Forum with 17 prominent Australians from diverse sectors to develop a blueprint for a clean energy transformation. Members include former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce, AGL Energy CEO Mr Andrew Vesey and TV presenter Ms Indira Naidoo.

Members presented this evidence-based plan for transition to political decision makers in November 2016.

The blueprint details eight foundational actions that should form the basis of Australia&#x27;s national plan to drive a clean energy transition:
# Update the electricity market to speed up a clean energy transition 
# Facilitate and accelerate the inevitable closure of coal plants
# Accelerate the uptake of clean energy and support the development of new technology
# Create an attractive sustainable investment environment for clean energy
# Ensure a just transition for communities and workers
# Protect vulnerable Australians 
# Make Australia&#x27;s buildings and businesses much more efficient users of energy
# Dramatically reduce transport emissions 
Culture and conservation economy

ACF continues its efforts to promote a cultural and conservation economy for Northern Australia and to create economic opportunities for Indigenous communities through workshops and cultural and knowledge exchanges between government, the tourism industry and Indigenous communities in the Kimberley, Cape York and Kakadu.

====Nuclear-free====

ACF continues to campaign for a nuclear-free future, calling on governments to reduce radioactive risks by stopping uranium mining and export, withdrawing from the global nuclear industry and responsibly managing Australia&#x27;s radioactive waste.

==History==

===The 1960s===
The ACF&#x27;s founders were drawn from Australia&#x27;s scientific, public service, business and political decision makers. A 1963 memo from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh inspired Francis Ratcliffe to consult with his CSIRO colleagues, and work with conservationists and community leaders, to establish a national conservation body. Ratcliffe saw conservation as one of the three most important issues facing humanity, along with the avoidance of an atomic war and achieving racial harmony. In August 1964, at a conference in Canberra, the organisation that was to become the Australian Conservation Foundation was born. Its first president was Sir Garfield Barwick, then Chief Justice of the High Court. The ACF came into being as a legal entity when its certificate of incorporation was issued in August 1966.

Early meetings of the ACF Council identified the Mallee, rainforests, the Great Barrier Reef and central Australia as the areas most needing coordinated national attention and action. However, due to limited resources and the urgency of the threats to the Great Barrier Reef, the ACF focussed on protecting the Reef from mining and oil drilling. During the 1960s, the ACF developed most of the campaign methods it used for the following twenty-five years. They included research, policy development, education and lobbying. The ACF gave support to other conservation organisations and established local branches.

Ratcliffe had a vision of building a large body of members to support ACF financially and assist with community education. As the 1960s drew to a close, the wave of public support for conservation escalated.

===The 1970s===

The 1970s was the decade when the ACF consolidated its operations, extended its vision and committed to long-term plans for the achievement of conservation goals.

In 1970, the campaign to protect large areas of the Mallee in Victoria was resolved in favour of conservation. In 1972 the remote and beautiful Lake Pedder in Tasmania was flooded by a hydroelectric dam. A group of ACF members, angered by the organisation&#x27;s failure to speak without fear or favour in opposition to the flooding of Lake Pedder, worked to bring about internal change. The ACF&#x27;s approach to conservation campaigning became more strategic, active and independent and throughout the 1970s public awareness of conservation issues increased.

In 1973, Gough Whitlam, then Prime Minister of Australia, launched the first issue of &quot;Habitat&quot;, the ACF&#x27;s magazine. Prince Philip, then president of the ACF, wrote that &quot;Habitat will provide essential news on conservation matters to the public at large&quot;.

The ACF pressed the federal government to lead a campaign for a worldwide ban on whaling and for an end to whaling in Australian waters. Thirty thousand supporters responded to a television advertising campaign to &quot;Save the Whales&quot;. Nine years of vigorous public campaigning later, a moratorium was declared on commercial whaling in 1981.

In 1974, Australia signed the World Heritage Convention and the ACF proposed World Heritage nominations for areas of great natural and cultural value, beginning with the Great Barrier Reef and Fraser Island.

Throughout the 1970s, ACF campaigned against uranium mining. The organisation was a principal party at the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (Fox Inquiry) into mining at Ranger in Kakadu, and pressed for the creation of a major national park to protect both the natural and cultural values of the area.

Inspired by its president, Dr Nugget Coombs, economist, environmentalist and Indigenous rights activist, the ACF moved to support Aboriginal land rights, and in 1978, pledged to work collaboratively with the Northern and Central Land Councils.

The ACF became increasingly involved in urban issues. ACF Councillor and unionist Jack Mundey was the force behind &quot;green bans&quot;, that saw unions withdraw their labour from demolition sites to protect historic urban precincts like The Rocks in Sydney. Pollution, climate change and population growth became topics of debate in the pages of &quot;Habitat&quot;.

===The 1980s===
The explosive environmental issue of the early 1980s was the campaign to protect the Franklin River, one of the last wild rivers in Australia. ACF mobilised supporters and resources behind the campaign that went all the way to the High Court to prevent the damming of the river. A pervasive theme in the 1980s was the fight for Australia&#x27;s native forests. In 1987, ACF and other environment groups pushed forests into the spotlight. Daintree&#x27;s tropical rainforests finally gained World Heritage listing in 1988, despite the vehement opposition of the then Queensland Government. Kakadu&#x27;s cultural and natural qualities were again under threat from uranium mining during the 1980s.

ACF played a lead role in securing Stages 1 and 2 of the Kakadu National Park and establishing an inquiry into the proposed Coronation Hill mine. The late 1980s saw ACF make a major effort to redress Australia&#x27;s massive land degradation problems. In 1989 a historic alliance between ACF and the National Farmers Federation called for the establishment of a national Landcare program. Landcare provided a vision for the transformation to ecological sustainability that was embraced by all major political parties. The 1990s were to be declared &#x27;The Decade of Landcare&#x27;.

One of the most important environment decisions in global terms was the Australian government&#x27;s rejection of mining in Antarctica in 1989. A policy of protection for Antarctica had been developed by ACF in the mid-1970s and it was ACF&#x27;s persistence with its vision and the success of its public awareness campaign that eventually convinced the government to act. In 1989 Peter Garrett, rock star and environmental activist, became President of ACF. Peter brought to the organisation his passion and commitment to a wide range of issues including anti-uranium, indigenous rights and Northern Australia.

Throughout the 1980s, ACF developed into an organisation that was more professional, more strategic in its alliances and more politically sophisticated. The decade closed with environmental issues high on the political agenda and ACF the leading national advocate for the environment.

===The 1990s===
In the 1990s ACF redefined its vision and sought to inspire a society that was environmentally aware and responsible. ACF positioned itself in the mainstream and by the end of the 1990s mainstream society had changed the way it viewed the environment. At the close of the millennium, progressive business came to understand environmental responsibility as a competitive advantage and more than sixty percent of Australians listed the environment as one of their major concerns.

The 1990s began on a high note. The environment was the focus of the federal election and ACF was swamped by the media with requests for information to produce environment-related TV programs, newspaper feature articles and radio documentaries. On World Environment Day 1990, ACF and Telecom Australia held a nationwide video conference for young people throughout the country to discuss ways to reduce ozone-depleting substances. Then in 1993 the recession hit and media attention turned away from the environment. Despite financial constraints, ACF continued to extend its influence through initiatives such as the Green Jobs Unit, which promoted employment creating environmental solutions; the alliance with the National Farmers Federation, which was renewed in 1996 and again in 2000; and the establishment of the GeneEthics Network to focus on the impact of genetic engineering.

ACF broadened its engagement with Indigenous peoples, both in Australia and in the Asia-Pacific region. The fight to stop mining at Coronation Hill succeeded in 1991 and from 1992 ACF was key in highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea.

The 1990s were the decade in which greenhouse pollution and climate change became critical issues. ACF helped to establish the Sustainable Energy Industries Council of Australia and the Federal government agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by the year 2005. When Canberra backtracked on this commitment in the mid-1990s, ACF spoke out in international forums including the 1995 Berlin Climate Change Conference.

In 1995 ACF launched its first website with a view to facilitating more frequent and effective communication with its diverse range of supporters. ACF worked to bring the degraded state of the Murray-Darling Basin to public attention. In 1996 ACF introduced the concept of environmental flows into the political arena and launched a major campaign to reverse the decline of Australia&#x27;s rivers.

ACF and other environment groups worked with the Mirrar people to halt the Jabiluka uranium mine at Kakadu. The 1998 blockade gained significant media attention and placed Jabiluka on the national and international agenda.

===21st century===

In 2000 ACF&#x27;s Natural Advantage: A Blueprint for a Sustainable Australia was launched by Sir William Deane, then Governor General of Australia. The blueprint outlined ACF&#x27;s vision for a sustainable Australia and set out inspirational and long-term solutions to environmental problems. Some of the key initiatives of the blueprint were a national project of sustainability reform; a long-term, strategic commitment to land and water repair; greenhouse gas reductions and energy efficiency; environmental tax reform; reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians; and building social capital to ensure all Australians benefit from their great natural advantages.

In the early years of the new millennium ACF &#x27;walked the talk&#x27; and moved its head office to the 60L Green Building in Carlton. ACF&#x27;s supporter base grew and many more Australians expressed a desire to make a difference for the environment. Polls regularly placed the environment among Australians&#x27; top concerns.

ACF has entered into a range of partnerships with Indigenous Australians, particularly in Northern Australia, with the scientific and business sector and with rural communities. ACF is developing a national community outreach program to inspire individual action on some of the most pressing environmental challenges Australians face. ACF&#x27;s achievements for the decade of 2000–2010 include the restoration of flows to the Snowy River, the banning of radioactive waste dumps in SA, a halt to broadscale land clearing in Queensland, the promised rehabilitation of the Jabiluka mine site in Kakadu and the declaration of new Marine Parks in Victoria.

==Funding==

The Australian Conservation Foundation reported total revenue of $18.1 Million and an expenditure of $19.26m Australian in 2023. The additional expenditure was drawn from operating reserves. Approximately 90 per cent of ACF&#x27;s income is received through individual donations, bequests, memberships and grants. 

ACF disclosed $16.38 Million raised in 2023 from donations and bequests. The ACF spends $1.3 Million on acquisition of donors &quot;through external service providers&quot;. They reported a net surplus of $3,263,972. Other sources of ACF income include rental income from the 60L Building and returns from ethical investments. The ACF reported full time equivalent staff (FTE) of 96 persons. 

==Organisation==

The Australian Conservation Foundation is governed by a 21-member Council of Representatives elected every three years by the organisation&#x27;s membership.[2] The Council meets regularly to determine organisational policy and priorities. ACF&#x27;s democratic structure helps to ensure that its sixty-odd staff keep in touch with Australia&#x27;s diverse grassroots environmental movement, while maintaining a high degree of professionalism and a strategic approach to sustainability issues of national significance. Council elects an Executive which meets more frequently to debate and decide on organisational matters in more detail. Council also appoints a voluntary President who represents ACF at a high level and who chairs Council meetings. In 2005 Professor Ian Lowe, distinguished Australian scientist and Emeritus Professor of Science, Technology and Society at Griffith University, was appointed President, replacing Peter Garrett. Professor Lowe served until June 2014. Don Henry was the CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation from 1998 to 2014. The current CEO is Kelly O&#x27;Shanassy.

The governing body of the Foundation is the Board, which consists of the President, two Vice-Presidents, four Councillors and up to four co-opted members. Co-opted Board members are chosen on the basis of their skills and experience, thus ensuring an appropriate mix of skills and experience within the Board.

<text>Enrique Figueroa Suárez (born February 25, 1964), also known as &quot;Quique Figueroa&quot;, is a Puerto Rican sailor. Figueroa is the only sailor of Puerto Rico to win four gold medals in the Central American-Caribbean Games. He has also competed at five Olympic Games, from 1988 to 2004 and in 2020. In 1999, Figueroa and his wife Carla Malatrasi won a gold medal in sailing in the Pan Am Hobie competition celebrated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. On March 3, 2003 the Senate of Puerto Rico honored Enrique Figueroa and his wife Carla Malatrasi by recognizing their achievements.

==Early years==
He was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he was raised and where he went to school receiving his primary and secondary education. He first became interested and participated in sailing when he was ten years old. In 1980, when he was sixteen, he participated in his first competition, the 3rd &quot;Hobie 16 worlds&quot; celebrated in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands where he came in 3rd place. The following year (1981), he participated in the 6th Hobie Fourteen Worlds in Fortaleza, Brazil where he came first.

In 1984, Figueroa was in the 7th Hobie 14 Worlds celebrated in Puerto Azul, Philippines and came 3rd; in the same year, he enrolled the Universidad del Sagrado Corazon (Sacred Heart University) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he majored in Business Marketing.

==Competitions==
Among the other competitions in which Figueroa has participated are:
* In 1985, Hobie 14 Worlds in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico where he won 1st place and
* In 1986, 6th Hobie 16 Worlds in Suva, Fiji where he took 2nd place.

In 1994, Figueroa won the IYRU World Sailing Championship title. He met and married Carla Malatrasi, a sportswoman from Puerto Rico who also loves sailing. In 1999, Figueroa and his wife Malatrasi won a gold medal in sailing in the Pan Am Hobie competition celebrated in Winnipeg, Canada. Figueroa competed in the 2000 Olympic Games held in Sydney, Australia without his wife. She stayed behind to give birth to the first of their two daughters, Isabella Victoria. In 2002, Figueroa and his wife came in 3rd place in the Hobie Racing-ISAF Sailing Games H-16 which took place in Marseille, France in which they went against 36 teams representing 20 nations.

On February 2, 2004, Figueroa and teammate Jorge Hernández, won the Olympic Games Rolex Regatta; they were named champions by beating twenty-nine entries in the tornado fleet. The regatta winners had their sights set on the 2004 Olympics and Partalympic Games in Athens, Greece. 503 sailors participated with a fleet of 323 boats representing 39 nations. Figueroa went to the 2004 Olympic Games and represented Puerto Rico at the Olympics for the fourth time.

==Honors and recognitions==
On March 3, 2003 the Senate of Puerto Rico honored Enrique Figueroa and his wife Carla Malatrasi by recognizing their achievements. Figueroa has been named &quot;Puerto Rican National Sportsman of the Year&quot; in sailing for 10 consecutive years.

<doc id="1189455" wikidata="Q1269170" url="?curid=1189455" title="Dynegy">
<text>Dynegy Inc. is an electric company based in Houston, Texas. It owns and operates a number of power stations in the U.S., all of which are powered by fossil fuels. Dynegy was acquired by Vistra Corp on April 9, 2018. The company is located at 601 Travis Street in Downtown Houston. The company was founded in 1984 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse. It was originally an energy brokerage, buying and selling natural gas supplies. It changed its name to NGC Corporation in 1995 after entering the electrical power generation business.

The company adopted the name Dynegy in 1998. Dynegy maintained a rivalry with the Houston-based Enron energy and trading firm, which it initially agreed to buy in 2001, before withdrawing from the deal as the extent of wrongdoing by Enron emerged.

Dynegy nearly went bankrupt in 2002, and several executives were eventually convicted of financial fraud and mismanagement. Dynegy exited the energy trading business in 2002 and the natural gas supply business in 2005, focusing its efforts on electrical generation. The company has one major subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings. It also has three operating subsidiaries: GasCo, CoalCo, and the &quot;stub group&quot; (for other miscellaneous business enterprises).

Dynegy Inc. was the subject of two unsuccessful takeover efforts in 2010. Its Dynegy Holdings subsidiary went bankrupt in November 2011, and Dynegy Inc. itself filed for bankruptcy protection on July 6, 2012. Its GasCo and CoalCo subsidiaries were unaffected by the bankruptcy filing. Dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on October 2, 2012. On April 9, 2018 Vistra Corp closed its acquisition of Dynegy following a FERC determination that the $1.7 billion deal raised no competitive concerns.

==Corporate predecessors==
===Natural Gas Clearinghouse===
Natural Gas Clearinghouse (NGC) was created in 1985 by Charles Watson; a consortium of natural gas pipeline companies that included Transco; investment bank Morgan Stanley; and the legal firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. A major investor was Kenneth Lay, later the chief executive officer of the energy firm Enron. Its first headquarters was on the 40th floor of the Transco Tower in Houston, Texas. NGC was so successful that in 1985 Morgan Stanley bought out some of the other investors and took a majority stake in the company.

NGC was purchased by Noble Affiliates, Inc. and Apache Corporation, independent oil and gas exploration and production companies, for a reported $50 million in 1989. In 1993, LG&amp;E Energy Corporation took a stake in NGC, which by then was the largest independent natural gas marketing firm in the United States and had revenues of more than US$2 billion. NGC purchased Trident NGL in 1994 in a deal worth more than $750 million. That same year, it also established a partnership with Nova (also known as Novagas Clearinghouse, a natural gas marketing company based in Canada) and British Gas, which gave both companies a financial stake in NGC.

===NGC Corporation===
Natural Gas Clearinghouse shortened its name to NGC Corporation in 1995 after its merger with Trident NGL closed. It became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange that same year. By 1996, it had grown to US$550 million in assets, and carried US$525 million in long-term debt. NGC Corporation also established several subsidiaries to enable it to enter the electrical generation, marketing, and sales areas. Electric Clearinghouse sold electricity, and the Energy Store marketed it. In August 1996, it purchased the natural gas gathering, marketing, and processing operations of Chevron Corporation. The latter deal gave Chevron a 29 percent stake in NGC. NGC followed that deal by buying Destec Energy for US$1.27 billion. The deal required NGC Corporation to sell Destec&#x27;s power generation subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for US$407 million, although NGC Corporation retained Destec&#x27;s 20 domestic gas-fired power plants.

==Dynegy history==

===Growth===
In June 1998, NGC Corporation changed its name to Dynegy, Inc. The company&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;We believe in people.&quot; Nova announced two months later that it was seeking to sell its stake in Dynegy. Dynegy bought Illinova Corporation in 1999 in a deal worth US$1.75 billion and the assumption of US$2.25 billion of Illinova Corp. debt. The deal also allowed Nova and British Gas to sell their stake in Dynegy.

Dynegy also began branching into areas outside natural gas and electrical generation. In August 2000, the company announced that it had purchased Extant Inc., a broadband provider building a nationwide fiber optic network, for US$152.5 million.

Dynegy, along with Enron, El Paso Corporation, Reliant Energy, and several other energy companies, was accused of price manipulation and other fraudulent practices during the California electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001. The case against Dynegy was dismissed in 2003.

In 2001, Dynegy made a white knight US$8 billion takeover bid for Enron, which was saddled with $13 billion in debt and whose stock had plummeted. The deal began unraveling two weeks later as Enron revealed even larger financial losses and more debt than previously reported. Dynegy withdrew its merger offer on November 28. Enron sued Dynegy on December 2, the day after Enron declared bankruptcy. (The lawsuit was settled in August 2002 after Dynegy agreed to pay Enron US$25 million for backing out of the deal.) Enron attempted to sell off assets in an effort to stay afloat. On January 3, 2002, Dynegy successfully acquired Enron&#x27;s Northern Natural Gas Company pipeline. NNGC was Enron&#x27;s most lucrative pipeline asset and had been put up as collateral in return for Dynegy providing financing to Enron during merger talks.

===Near-bankruptcy of 2002===

Dynegy came close to bankruptcy in 2002. Investor pressure on energy stocks in the wake of the Enron collapse pushed Dynegy&#x27;s stock price down 42 percent by late April. The company also admitted on April 26 that it made a large accounting error on a fuel contract, which further depressed the stock price 22 percent. Moody&#x27;s Investors Service announced it was reviewing all US$4 billion of Dynegy debt. In financial distress, Dynegy successfully applied for a US$900 million line of credit. On May 1, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened a formal investigation into how Dynegy&#x27;s &quot;Project Alpha&quot;, an internal corporate initiative that allegedly inflated income from natural gas transactions and illegally structured business partnerships to avoid income. Two weeks later, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Dynegy&#x27;s Illinova subsidiary was part of the investigation. Illinova had formed a joint partnership named Catlin in January 2000 with a little-known investment company named Black Thunder. Catlin took over some of Illinova&#x27;s electrical generating assets. Although Black Thunder put up almost 90 percent of the money to form Catlin, Dynegy was required to buy out Black Thunder&#x27;s investment or sell off the assets if Catlin did not earn a specified high rate of return. On May 28, Dynegy founder, president, and chief executive officer Charles Watson resigned. Dynegy Inc. chairman Dan Dienstbier was named interim CEO. In mid-June, Dynegy reported that its first quarter income had fallen 80 percent. It also admitted that it had signed long-term power contracts that would not produce revenue for years to come; but it had charged the income to the current year&#x27;s revenues in an attempt to bolster its bottom line. On June 19, Dynegy&#x27;s chief financial office, Rob Doty, resigned. The following day, Dynegy shut down its online energy trading system.

Dynegy was quickly approaching bankruptcy by late June 2002. On June 25, the company announced it would sell off assets in an attempt to raise US$2 billion in cash. Moody&#x27;s downgraded the rating of the company&#x27;s bonds to &quot;junk&quot; status on June 28. Dynegy announced it might need a financial partner to help it stabilize. After the July 23 announcement, the company&#x27;s shares dropped 64 percent. Desperate for cash, Dynegy sold the Northern Natural Gas Company to MidAmerican Energy Holdings for $928 million on July 29 ($572 less than it paid for it). The sale saved Dynegy from bankruptcy.

Although Dynegy avoided bankruptcy, the fallout from the company&#x27;s accounting practices continued throughout 2002. In August, former Dynegy controller and chief accounting officer Bradley P. Farnsworth sued the company, saying he&#x27;d been fired after refusing to help manipulate the company&#x27;s financial statements in the summer of 2000. The company suspended its dividend on August 12. On September 3, interim chairman Glenn F. Tilton resigned in order to become chief executive officer of United Airlines. On September 24, Dynegy announced that it had agreed to pay a US$3 million fine for using the Catlin company and other business partnerships to hide losses and taxable income. It also admitted that it had engaged in &quot;round-trip&quot; trades, phony natural gas and electricity trades designed to mislead investors and other companies about the success of Dynegy&#x27;s online trading operation. The company later fired five traders after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) discovered that Dynegy energy traders had supplied false prices to industry trade publications. The company later paid a US$5 million fine to the CFTC. Still needing cash, Dynegy sold its Hornsea natural gas storage site in the United Kingdom to help pay the fine.

Dynegy shuttered its online energy trading business for good on October 16, 2002. The closure led Dynegy to lay off 14 percent of its workforce, which left it with just 4,600 employees.

Several Dynegy executives were later convicted or indicted for their roles in Dynegy&#x27;s near-collapse. In June 2003, Jamie Olis (former Senior Director of Tax Planning), Gene Foster (former Vice President for Taxation), and Helen Sharkey (a former employee in Dynegy&#x27;s risk control and deal structure groups), were indicted on numerous counts of mail and wire fraud. According to court documents, the three employees conceived of a plan in early 2001 to borrow money but make it look like operational revenue. A corporation known as ABG Gas Supply was created. ABG secured loans from Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Deutsche Bank to buy natural gas at market prices. ABG then sold this gas at a discount to Dynegy, which resold it at market prices and booked a $300 million profit. ABG then bought natural gas at market prices, and sold it at a premium to Dynegy. The profits ABG booked were then used to repay the loans. Prosecutors accused Olis, Foster, and Sharkey of deceiving auditors, regulators, and other company executives regarding the transactions. Foster and Sharkey pleaded guilty two months later. Olis was found guilty in March 2004, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. (A year later, after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a different case held that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the Constitution, Olis&#x27; sentence was reduced to just six years in prison.) In December 2003, three former executives at Nicor Energy LLC (a joint venture of Dynegy and Nicor), were indicted for illegally manipulating that firm&#x27;s income by US$11 million in 2001 to hide losses. Former chief financial officer Robert Doty agreed to pay a $376,650 fine in October 2007 for his role in helping to conceal the ABG Gas Supply scheme.

Shareholders, too, were unhappy with Dynegy&#x27;s actions during the financial crisis. A class action lawsuit was filed against the company in 2002. In April 2005, Dynegy agreed to settle the lawsuit. Shareholders would be paid a total of US$468 million. To come up with the money, Dynegy paid out $250 million in cash and issued $68 million in stock to the plaintiffs. Its insurance companies paid another $150 million to the plaintiffs.

===Recovery and restructuring===
On October 23, 2002, Dynegy hired Bruce Williamson, a former Duke Energy executive, as its chief executive officer. Six weeks later, Dynegy hired Nick J. Caruso, a former chief financial officer at Royal Dutch Shell, as its new chief financial officer.

Williamson began a program of cost cutting, elimination of unprofitable businesses, and financial restructuring. As Williamson later told the &quot;New York Times&quot; in June 2005, &quot;We had businesses in trading, in marketing, in broadband communications, in Europe, in communications as far as China. What we have done is very systematically sell those off, shut down offices and concentrate on the two businesses that looked like we had a competitive advantage.&quot; Dynegy sold its telecommunications business in Europe in January 2003, restated its income for 2001 and 2002, sold a natural gas terminal in Louisiana, sold its telecommunications business in North America in April 2003, engaged in a US$1.6 billion refinancing and other restructuring of its debt, sold its Illinois Power Company subsidiary to Ameren, and nullified a number of contracts in non-core or money-losing areas. In March 2004, Wiliamson was named chairman of the company, succeeding Dan Dienstbier (who retired).

Dynegy undertook a strategy to move into coal-fired and hydroelectric electrical generation in 2004, and out of natural gas distribution and trading. In November 2004, the company acquired four natural gas-fired and four hydroelectric power generation plants in the Northeast United States. In March 2005, it agreed to settle a 1999 dispute with the Environmental Protection Agency by spending US$321 million to repair and upgrade coal-fired generating plants in Illinois to reduce pollutants. In mid-2005, Dynegy hired Credit Suisse First Boston to assist it in finding a buyer for its natural gas transmission businesses. The sale of this business came quickly: In August 2005, Dynegy sold this business to Targa Resources, a company owned by private equity firm Warburg Pincus.

In September 2006, Dynegy and LS Power Group agreed to a joint venture in a deal worth US$2.3 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Dynegy gave LS Power a 40 percent stake in Dynegy itself while LS Power contributed 10 of its power plants. Dynegy also agreed to create a 245 million new Class B shares, which it turned over to LS Power. In May 2007, ChevronTexaco announced it was selling its 12 percent stake in Dynegy to the public. The sale netted ChevronTexaco US$680 million by July. The joint venture did not last, however. In August 2009, LS Power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from Dynegy for US$1.025 billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture. Part of the reason for the joint venture&#x27;s demise was another collapse in Dynegy&#x27;s share price. Dynegy&#x27;s shares fell 80 percent in the two years after the deal closed, and the company posted a large $345 million loss in the second quarter of 2009. LS Power also agreed to return all its Class B shares, so that Dynegy would only have 95 million shares of common stock outstanding. The dissolution of the joint venture left LS Power with a 15 percent stake in Dynegy.

Dynegy&#x27;s move into coal-powered electrical generation was not without controversy. In September 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Dynegy and other utilities, arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coal-fired generating plants created. After a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering, Dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company. Its move into coal-fired electrical generation led the National Environmental Trust, an environmental group, to derisively call Dynegy the &quot;king of coal&quot; in 2008.

===Takeover battles===
On August 13, 2010, the Blackstone Group announced plans to purchase Dynegy for US$4.7 billion. As part of the deal, NRG Energy would acquire four natural gas plants in California and Maine for US$1.36 Billion. Seneca Capital, Dynegy&#x27;s largest shareholder, fought the purchase in a proxy fight. Dynegy investor Carl Icahn also promised a proxy battle, arguing that Blackstone Group&#x27;s offer was too low. Icahn raised his stake in Dynegy to 12.9 percent in preparation for the shareholder fight. Seneca Capital nominated former railroad executive E. Hunter Harrison and former energy company executive Jeff D. Hunter for the Dynegy board of directors, challenging Bruce Williamson and David Biegler (a Williamson ally).

A series of maneuvers followed. Dynegy executives said the offer was a good one, as the deal would give Dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt. With energy prices at cyclical lows, the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing. Blackstone Group initially said it would not offer more than US$4.50 per share, but then revised its offer later that day to US$5.00 a share. Worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the Blackstone Group offer, Dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to November 23, but postponement did not occur. Legal counsel advised that Delaware law (under which Dynegy was incorporated) considered a postponement a new meeting, and that would require notifying shareholders (again) and giving at least 20 days&#x27; notice. Furthermore, Dynegy&#x27;s proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement (which could lead to lawsuits). Legal counsel also believed that Dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes, which would delay a meeting until early 2011. During the shareholder meeting, management&#x27;s fears proved accurate. On November 19, Dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the Blackstone bid. (Dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date, and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose.) During the four-day recess, Dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the Blackstone Group bid failed. On November 23, 2010, Dynegy management and Blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the US$5.00 a share bid.

On December 15, 2010, Icahn offered a US$5.50 a share cash bid for Dynegy. Dynegy&#x27;s board asked for other bids, but none emerged. But Icahn, too, found little support among shareholders. He extended his offer by two weeks on January 25, 2011. That same day, Seneca Capital said it would not even entertain a US$6.00 a share bid. Dynegy&#x27;s board urged shareholders to accept the Icahn bid, or risk bankruptcy. But by mid-February, even those investors willing to accept the Icahn bid had rescinded these offers. Icahn extended his offer by few days. The Icahn bid, too, collapsed.

On February 20, 2011, Bruce Williamson resigned as Dynegy&#x27;s chairman, and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on March 11. Chief financial officer Holli C. Nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on March 11 as well. Board member Thomas W. Elward was named interim chairman, and Robert C. Flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer. Harrison was elected to the board of directors. Also elected to the board were Vincent J. Intrieri, Senior Managing Director of Icahn Capital, and Samuel J. Merksamer, an investment analyst for Icahn Capital.

==2012 bankruptcy==
The takeover bids all came after one of Dynegy&#x27;s largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy. On November 7, 2011 Dynegy Holdings, the largest of Dynegy Inc.&#x27;s four subsidiaries, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

The bankruptcy was a novel one. Dynegy had structured itself so that Dynegy Inc. (the holding company) had little debt. Nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings, which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions. Dynegy Inc. created three operating divisions: the natural gas group (GasCo), the coal group (CoalCo), and a group for all other businesses (known as &quot;the stub group&quot;). GasCo and CoalCo were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either Dynegy Inc. or Dynegy Holdings. Part of the structure meant that few of the natural GasCo&#x27;s and CoalCo&#x27;s dividends were given to Dynegy Holdings. To separate Dynegy Holdings from Dynegy Inc., Dynegy Holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company (LLC). This legal maneuver took advantage of a Delaware Supreme Court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an LLC&#x27;s board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty. Finally, GasCo and CoalCo sold themselves to Dynegy Inc., which left Dynegy Holdings holding US$1.25 billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of GasCo and CoalCo in the event of a default. Under the structure adopted by Dynegy Inc., the company could meet its debt obligations to Dynegy Holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt. This provided an incentive for Dynegy Inc. to withhold payment and force Dynegy Holdings to declare bankruptcy (thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off).

The restructuring plan put Dynegy&#x27;s assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of Dynegy Holdings. The goal was to protect Dynegy&#x27;s secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors. The plan had already generated one lawsuit. In 2011, U.S. Bancorp, representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two Dynegy power plants new Newburgh, New York (the Danskammer Generating Station and the Roseton Generating Station).

On March 8, 2011, Dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt. The company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm Lazard and the law firm White &amp; Case to advise it on debt restructuring. Vincent Intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee.

On March 9, 2012, the November 2011 bankruptcy of Dynegy Holdings ran into difficulty. An examiner appointed by the United States bankruptcy court found that the Dynegy Inc.&#x27;s purchase of CoalCo was fraudulent. The examiner found that Dynegy Holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place, and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the Dynegy Holdings board of directors. This allowed the Dynegy Holdings board of directors to sue the Dynegy Inc. board of directors for damages (which could run into the billions of dollars). This threw the Dynegy Holdings bankruptcy filing into doubt, and put Dynegy Inc. on the hook for billions in debt. The bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of Dynegy Holdings to recover these debts.

The bankruptcy court examiner&#x27;s finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of Dynegy Inc. itself. On April 3, 2012, Dynegy Inc. announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. bankruptcy trustee, the board of directors of Dynegy Holdings, and its other creditors. The agreement, which affected US$2.25 billion in debt, gave all creditors 99 percent of the stock of Dynegy Inc. once it emerged from bankruptcy. Existing shareholders would get just 1 percent of the stock in the new company, with warrants enabling them to buy up to 13.5 of common stock at a set price over the next five years. Accordingly, Dynegy Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 5, 2012. The bankruptcy plan filed by Dynegy Inc. also called for a merger with Dynegy Holdings. The bankruptcy filing did not, however, affect GasCo, CoalCo, or the &quot;stub group&quot;, and allowed the Dynegy Holdings bankruptcy to proceed. Dynegy&#x27;s stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange following the bankruptcy filing. U.S. Bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a $540 million claim against the company in bankruptcy court. The bondholders represented by U.S. Bancorp would also get a further US$31 million if the Danskammer and Roseton plants are sold.

As part of its bankruptcy filing, Dynegy moved its corporate headquarters. In November 2011, the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at 601 Travis Street in Houston. (It occupied these quarters early July 2012.) Dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the Wells Fargo Plaza, however. As part of its bankruptcy filing, the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which Dynegy would abandon of space at Wells Fargo Plaza. The company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining as well.

Dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on August 24, at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan. A court hearing on the creditor-approved bankruptcy plan would then be held September 5, after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection.

Dynegy Inc. posted a second-quarter 2012 loss of $1.06 billion, an increase to $8.65 per share from 95 cents per share a year ago. The company blamed, among other things, markedly lower demand for its electricity, much lower prices for its coal, and a $941 million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to Dynegy Holdings. The company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in September 2012.

Dynegy agreed to auction off its Roseton and Danskammer energy plants in New York state in order to emerge from bankruptcy. Dynegy had signed a sale-leaseback agreement in 2001 with Public Services Enterprise Group for the Roseton and Danskammer facilities. Fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders (up to $571 million), while the remaining 50 percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors. The unsecured creditors would get $200 million in cash. Unsecured creditors also would receive 99 percent of Dynegy&#x27;s new stock, with the company retaining the rest (with warrants to purchase 13.5 percent of the stock after five years). Dynegy also agreed to pay holders of $206 million in subordinated capital income securities just $55 million in principal and $16 million in interest to settle their claims. The bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between Dynegy Holdings and Dynegy, Inc.

Dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on October 2, 2012, and its shares began trading on October 3 under the &quot;DYN&quot; symbol.

==Post-bankruptcy==
On November 5, 2012, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission settled a decade-old lawsuit which alleged that Dynegy had manipulated the California energy market. While the lawsuit continued, Dynegy sold its California subsidiary to NRG Energy, Inc. NRG Energy subsequently agreed to pay $20 million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than $100 million to install 200 public fast-charging electric vehicle stations and 10,000 plug-in stations throughout California. Twenty percent of the stations were required to be in low-income neighborhoods.

On January 4, 2013, Dynegy&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Howell, resigned. Howell continued as a consultant to the company, and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition.

On February 2, 2013, Dynegy&#x27;s South Bay Power Plant in San Diego, California, was imploded. The demolition of the smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than 1,000 people.

===Roseton and Danskammer sales===
The sale of the Roseton and Danskammer plants—a condition of Dynegy&#x27;s emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly. On November 8, 2012, members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 320 struck the Roseton and Danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and Dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits. Dynegy&#x27;s bankruptcy also left $17 million in unpaid property taxes in Orange County, New York. This created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools in Ulster County and create severe cutbacks in Orange County services. On December 10, 2012, Dynegy announced it would sell the Roseton plant to Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy for $19.5 million in cash. The sale closed on April 30, 2013.

The Danskammer plant sale was far more troubled. The plant was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, rendering it inoperable. On December 10, Dynegy said that ICS NY Holdings would buy the plant for $3.5 million and demolish it. But the ICS sale stalled. Under the terms of the auction, ICS NY had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement, and pay its portion of the plant&#x27;s outstanding property taxes. But, Dynegy said, the company never did either. ICS defended itself, saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement. On May 25, 2013, Dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ICA to fulfill its obligations. The court imposed a July 31 deadline for ICS to close the sale, but it did not meet the deadline. Dynegy subsequently sought another buyer. Helios Power Capital, a private equity firm, agreed to purchase the plant for $3.5 million in cash on August 20. The court approved the sale on September 2.

===Ameren purchase===
In mid-March 2013, Dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of Ameren, an Illinois power company. The deal, worth $900 million, involved Ameren&#x27;s Ameren Energy Generating Co. (Genco); Genco&#x27;s controlling interest in Electric Energy Inc.; AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Co.; and Ameren Energy Marketing Co. Dynegy formed a subsidiary, Illinois Power Holdings (IPH), to purchase the Ameren subsidiaries. No cash changed hands; rather, IPH agreed to assume $825 million in debt owed by Genco and the other subsidiaries. Ameren also transferred about $180 million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in 2015. Ameren retained Genco&#x27;s inactive Hutsonville and Meredosia plants, and agreed to buy back from IPH for $133 million three natural gas electrical generating plants. Dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants. Under the deal, Dynegy acquired five coal-fired generating plants: Coffeen in Coffeen, Illinois; Duck Creek in Canton, Illinois; E.D. Edwards in Bartonville, Illinois; Joppa in Joppa, Illinois; and Newton in Newton, Illinois.

As the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval, Dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt. The company obtained $1.3 billion in term loan B facilities and $500 million in revolving credit. The company used this income to retire an $800 million, seven-year line of credit and a $500 million, two-year line of credit. Dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years. Two syndicated loans made up the $1.3 billion loan package. The $800 million loan and the $500 million loan were both due in 2020. This left Dynegy with $1.28 billion in lines of credit and $500 million in outstanding bonds.

The Ameren plants-for-debt swap also ran into trouble. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from Dynegy&#x27;s expanding market share in the Midwest. But on April 16, FERC said that the studies submitted by Dynegy and Ameren were inadequate, and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to FERC by July 14. On July 16, FERC again declined to approve or disapprove the Dynegy-Ameren deal. The agency said that it Dynegy&#x27;s study showed it charging market rates for energy in the Midwest. But FERC said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit Dynegy to charge much more. Furthermore, federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area IPH could serve. FERC asked Dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion. In August, the Sierra Club formally filed opposition to the Dynegy-Ameren deal. The environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave Dynegy too much market power. It also argued that Dynegy and Ameren had submitted only regional market power data, and had not accounted for local impacts (which could be very severe).

Another obstacle emerged on June 6. Ameren was required to install pollution-reducing equipment on its five coal-fired generating plants in 2015. But because Ameren was in financial difficulty, it sought and received a waiver from the state of Illinois granting it a five-year delay. Ameren sought to transfer this delay to Dynegy, so that Dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until 2020, either. But the Illinois Pollution Control Board denied Ameren&#x27;s request. Dynegy filed its own request for a five-year waiver in July, and warned that the Ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver. But the Sierra Club, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, and other environmental groups said Dynegy had the resources to install the equipment, and opposed a waiver. ACM Partners, a financial firm hired by the Sierra Club, also argued that Dynegy purposefully left IPH significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent company&#x27;s resources. Dynegy disagreed, but the firm warned that if IPH went bankrupt, workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation. The Illinois AFL-CIO, however, supported Dynegy&#x27;s request on September 16, saying that local jobs depended on the waiver. The pollution board said it would make a decision by November 2013. Foresight Energy, a major Illinois coal mining company, said it would install the $500 million anti-pollution devices for free if Dynegy agreed to sign a long-term contract to accept coal only from Foresight Energy. Dynegy declined the offer (in part because it already has long-term coal contracts), and environmental groups opposed it.

There was some speculation by financial analysts that the Dynegy-Ameren deal was a poor one. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of UBS Investment Research, said Dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coal-powered plants rather than add pollution control devices. Dumoulin-Smith said that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in July 2018. Because the Edwards plant is in an area of low air quality, EPA is likely to force Dynegy to close the plant anyway. The remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of Duck Creek Station which spent nearly US$800m on sulfur dioxide removal, and may also be forced to close if EPA regulations tighten in the future (a highly likely possibility, he said).

===2014 acquisitions===
On August 22, 2014, Dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously. Dynegy acquired Duke’s Midwest Generation assets and retail business for $2.8 billion in cash, and the power generating assets of EquiPower Resources for $3.45 billion, with $3.35 billion in cash and $100 million in stock. This increased the company&#x27;s generating capacity from 13000 MW to nearly 26000 MW.

===Acquisition by Vistra===
On April 9, 2018, Vistra Corp closed its acquisition of Dynegy following a FERC determination that the $1.7 billion deal raised no competitive concerns.

== Controversy ==
In June 2021, the Attorney General of Illinois filed a lawsuit against Dynegy claiming that the company polluted groundwater with contaminants from coal ash.

<text>The first Asp was a schooner in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

&quot;Asp&quot;, the former British merchant vessel &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, was captured on Lake Ontario in 1812 by the schooner , purchased by the Navy from the prize court: outfitted; and commissioned on 6 February 1813.

==Service history==

===Battle of York===
&quot;Asp&quot; got underway on 25 April 1813 as a unit of Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s Lake Ontario squadron escorting General Henry Dearborn&#x27;s 1,700 troops to York (now Toronto), Canada. The squadron arrived off York two days later. While Dearborn&#x27;s troops hustled ashore, &quot;Asp&quot; and the other ships of the squadron supported them by bombarding the town&#x27;s defenses. Outnumbered and outgunned, the defenders gave way after a brief, but stubborn, defense. The squadron remained at York for about a week loading booty of war and destroying that which could not be carried on. At York, the American force captured the 10-gun brig and destroyed an &#x27;almost complete&#x27; 24-gun ship. When the warships left York, they spent the following two weeks convoying reinforcements and supplies to General Dearborn.

===Battle of Fort George===
The next enterprise decided upon was an attack on Fort George, located almost due south from York across the western end of Lake Ontario and on the Canadian side of the Niagara River where it empties into Lake Ontario. Commodore Chauncy carefully reconnoitered the defenses of the British stronghold on 26 May. Before dawn the following morning, the squadron moved in with the embarked assault troops. While the larger ships of the squadron bombarded the various defenses and batteries around the fort, &quot;Asp&quot; joined and in covering the landings themselves. Their point-blank grape shot fire riddled the British ranks to such a degree that the American troops easily established a beachhead and soon drove off the remnants of the British who tried unsuccessfully to rally further inland. In that victorious combined operation, the American Army and Navy succeeded in securing the Niagara frontier and the river by forcing the British to evacuate the entire area. It also allowed the Lake Erie squadron to be augmented by five vessels which had been bottled up in the Niagara between the falls and British batteries at the southern (Lake Erie) end of the river.

===At Sackett&#x27;s Harbor===
While the American squadron had been concentrating on the western end of Lake Ontario, the British had been augmenting their squadron at Kingston in the eastern portion. Late in May, they made an unsuccessful attempt to carry Sackett&#x27;s Harbor by storm. Chauncy took his squadron – &quot;Asp&quot; included – back to the eastern part of the lake and, on 2 June, put into Sackett&#x27;s Harbor where he was forced to remain due to the temporary inferiority of his force to that of the British. The enemy then ranged the lake at will capturing stockpiles and intercepting American supplies.

===Raid on York===
However, on 21 July, the American squadron weighed anchor and set a course for the western end of the lake. The warships arrived at Niagara on the 27th and loaded a force of American troops to repeat the attack on York carried out the previous summer. On 30 July, the squadron conducted another successful raid on York, destroying 11 British transports and carrying off 5 cannon, some ammunition, and some flour. The ships returned to Niagara and disembarked the troops on 3 August.

===Action off the Niagara===
While &quot;Asp&quot; and the rest of the American squadron were still at Niagara, the British squadron appeared off the anchorage on the 7th. For three days, the two squadrons went through a tedious series of maneuvers ostensibly to bring about an action. A somewhat desultory action took place on the evening of the 10th. It consisted of some long-range gunfire in which &quot;Asp&quot; participated. The main result of that skirmish was the loss of two American schooners, &quot;Growler&quot; and , which ships turned in the wrong direction and were cut off by the British. After another day or so of ineffectual maneuvering, the American squadron headed for Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, where it arrived on the 13th. After taking on five weeks worth of provisions, the warships departed the harbor that same evening. The two squadrons spent the next month sailing up and down the lake, each trying to maneuver the other into a position of decisive advantage to itself.

===Action off the Genesee===
Near the mouth of the Genesee River on 11 September, the American warships exchanged gunfire with their British counterparts from extreme range. Though the British received the worst of it due to the American superiority in long guns, damage to both sides proved almost inconsequential; and the British escaped into Amherst Bay.

=== Action off Burlington===
After a 17-day hiatus, the two forces met again on 28 September at York Bay. When the British ships were sighted, &quot;Asp&quot; was in tow of the American lead ship, , with following close behind. The other American ships followed some distance astern. Fearing the loss of their sternmost ships, the British came around. The three leading American ships bore down upon them. The British van, composed of their two largest ships, the flagship 
 and , opened with their starboard batteries. The Americans responded, and &quot;Pike&quot; quickly shot away &quot;Wolfe&#x27;s&quot; main topmast and main yard. Thereupon, the British flagship crowded sail on her foremast and moved off in headlong flight covered by &quot;Royal George&quot;. All other British ships, with the exception of &quot;Royal George&quot;, followed the example of the flagship. &quot;Pike&quot; tried to pursue but did not cast off &quot;Asp&quot; and, therefore, made no gain on the fleeing enemy who made good his escape. For the remainder of the 1813 navigation season, the American squadron kept the British blockaded in Kingston.

=== Later operations===
With the British cleared from Lake Ontario, &quot;Asp&quot; and the other schooners became transports for troops and stores. On one occasion, 17 November 1813, she assisted in transporting 1,100 of General William Henry Harrison&#x27;s troops from the mouth of the Genesee River to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. &quot;Asp&quot; never again saw combat and, apparently, served through the remainder of the war as a transport. She was sold at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on 15 May 1815.

<text>Peter Waage (29 June 1833 – 13 January 1900) was a Norwegian chemist and professor of chemistry at the University of Kristiania. Along with his brother-in-law Cato Maximilian Guldberg, he co-discovered and developed the law of mass action between 1864 and 1879.
==Biography==
He grew up on the island of Hidra in Vest-Agder, Norway. He was the son of Peder Pedersen Waage (1796–1872) and Regine Lovise Wathne (1802–72). He attended the Bergen Cathedral School and studied chemistry and mineralogy at the University of Kristiania (now University of Oslo) under Adolph Strecker. In 1858, he received the Crown Prince&#x27;s gold medal (&quot;Kronprinsens gullmedalje&quot;) for work on the development of a theory of oxygen-containing acid radicals. He became a cand.real. in 1859. He subsequently traveled to France and Germany, where he studied for two years including time spent with Robert Bunsen in Heidelberg.

In 1861, Waage was made an associate professor and in 1866 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Kristiania. He remained a professor at the University over 30 years. He was also chairman of the Norwegian Polytechnic Society from 1868 to 1869, and the first chairman of the Norwegian branch of the YMCA when it was established in 1880.

==Personal life==
He was married twice. In 1862, he married Johanne Christiane Tandberg Riddervold (1838- 1869), daughter of Hans Riddervold (1795-1876) and Anne Marie Bull (1804-70). Following the death of his first wife, he was married in 1870 with Mathilde Sofie Guldberg (1845-1907), sister of Cato Guldberg.

<text>Charles Wachsmuth (September 13, 1829 – February 7, 1896) was a German-American paleontologist and businessman. After emigrating to the United States, he became a renowned expert on the Paleozoic fossil animals known as crinoids. He and his collaborator, Frank Springer, published numerous articles on the subject and built an exceptional collection of crinoid fossils. The culmination of his work was the two-volume &quot;Monograph of the North American Crinoidea Camerata&quot;, coauthored with Springer and published posthumously in 1897.

==Early life==
Wachsmuth was born on September 13, 1829, in Hanover, Germany. His father, Christian Wachsmuth, was a lawyer and member of the Frankfurt parliament who intended his son to follow him in the legal profession. However, ill health forced Charles to leave school at age sixteen. His physician recommended a career in business. In 1852, he emigrated to the United States and worked in New York as an agent for a Hamburg shipping firm until 1854.

The climate in New York did not agree with Wachsmuth and after recovering from a severe attack of pneumonia he moved west in 1855 and settled in Burlington, Iowa. That same year he married Bernandina Lorenz and opened a grocery store.

==Paleontology==

Poor health continued to plague Wachsmuth. His doctor recommended outdoor exercise and suggested fossil hunting as a pleasant and healthy pastime. Wachsmuth soon found that the local limestone formations held an extensive array of the Paleozoic fossil animals known as crinoids. Eventually, the region would be recognized as one of the world&#x27;s richest sources of these fossils.

Wachsmuth became an enthusiastic collector and student of crinoid fossils. His health finally improved and he turned over the operation of his business to his wife so that he could devote all his time to his new passion. Over the next few years, the collection grew to the point where it began to attract the attention of scientists across the country. Geologists Amos Worthen and Fielding Meek borrowed specimens while preparing their geological survey of Illinois. In 1864, Louis Agassiz came to Burlington to meet Wachsmuth and view his collection.

By 1865, the grocery business had made Wachsmuth financially independent. He and his wife traveled first to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to visit Agassiz and the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Next, the Wachsmuths continued on to Europe where they examined museum collections and collected fossils to take home. His last stop was the British Museum in London where he was pleased to learn that the reputation of his collection in Burlington had preceded him.

When Wachsmuth returned to Burlington in 1866, he devoted all his energies to the continued collection and study of crinoid fossils. In 1866 he coauthored his first paper with Agassiz student William H. Niles, showing that the Burlington formation was actually composed of two geological horizons. At this time, Wachsmuth preferred to focus on research and let others publish.

In 1869, Frank Springer, a young attorney, began to practice law in Burlington. Springer had studied natural history at the University of Iowa but decided that law was a more practical career. In Burlington, he soon made friends with Wachsmuth and joined him in the collection and study of crinoids. In 1872, Springer moved his law practice to New Mexico but continued to collaborate with Wachsmuth and returned to Burlington whenever possible.

In 1872, Agassiz visited Burlington again and was impressed by the growth of the collection and the quality of the fossils. He purchased the collection for $6,000 and hired Wachsmuth to take charge of the entire crinoid assemblage at Harvard&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Agassiz encouraged Wachsmuth to study the literature on crinoids and publish his own findings. Wachsmuth held this position until Agassiz&#x27;s death in December, 1873.

Wachsmuth traveled to Europe and Asia in 1874, bringing with him a small collection of crinoid fossils which he sold to the British Museum for £80. He returned to Burlington the same year and set out to build another, even larger collection of fossils. 

With the help of his wife and Frank Springer, the new collection of crinoids soon rivaled any in the world. Because of his health, Wachsmuth spent winters collecting fossils in the warmer climate of the American South. Springer traveled to Europe and brought back an extensive selection of fossils from England, France, Russia, and Bohemia. Other fossils from around the world were purchased or acquired in trade. Wachsmuth built a special, fireproof museum behind his home to store the fossils. In addition a comprehensive library of crinoid literature was gathered.

Wachsmuth and Springer published their findings in a variety of scientific journals. They were not interested in naming and describing new species but instead concentrated on issues of morphology and classification. The culmination of their work was the two-volume &quot;Monograph of the North American Crinoidea Camerata&quot; (1897), published by the Museum of Comparative Zoology after Wachsmuth’s death. This work fundamentally revised contemporary crinoid taxonomy.

After a period of declining health, Wachsmuth died on February 7, 1896. Springer maintained the museum and library in Burlington for another fifteen years and then donated the collection to the Smithsonian.

Wachsmuth was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Geological Society of America, the Iowa Academy of Science, the Imperial Society of Natural Sciences of Moscow, and corresponding member of the Philadelphia Academy of Science.

<text>John Francis Wade (1 January 1711 – 16 August 1786) was an English hymnist who is usually credited with writing and composing the hymn &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; (which was translated as &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot; in 1841 by Frederick Oakeley). The authorship is disputed, with 13th-century cardinal St. Bonaventure and King John IV of Portugal being proposed as alternative composers, although the earliest known manuscripts of the hymn discovered from 1946 all bear Wade&#x27;s signature. Others argue for John Reading () or anonymous Cistercian monks.

Wade fled to France after the Jacobite rising of 1745 was crushed. As a Catholic layman, he lived with exiled English Catholics in France, where he taught music and worked on church music for private use.

==Jacobite symbolism==
Bennett Zon, Editor of the &quot;Yale Journal of Music and Religion&quot;, has noted that Wade&#x27;s Roman Catholic liturgical books were often decorated with Jacobite floral imagery. He argued that the texts had coded Jacobite meanings. He has suggested that the hymn &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; is a birth ode to Bonnie Prince Charlie, replete with secret references decipherable by the &quot;faithful&quot;: the followers of the Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart.

<doc id="1189485" wikidata="Q298439" url="?curid=1189485" title="Abu al-Wafa' al-Buzjani">
<text>Abū al-Wafāʾ Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ismāʿīl ibn al-ʿAbbās al-Būzjānī or Abū al-Wafā Būzhjānī (, ; 10 June 940 – 15 July 998) was a Persian mathematician and astronomer who worked in Baghdad. He made important innovations in spherical trigonometry, and his work on arithmetic for businessmen contains the first instance of using negative numbers in a medieval Islamic text.

He is also credited with compiling the tables of sines and tangents at 15&#x27; intervals. He also introduced the secant and cosecant functions, as well studied the interrelations between the six trigonometric lines associated with an arc. His &quot;Almagest&quot; was widely read by medieval Arabic astronomers in the centuries after his death. He is known to have written several other books that have not survived.

==Life==
He was born in Buzhgan, (now Torbat-e Jam) in Khorasan (in today&#x27;s Iran). At age 19, in 959, he moved to Baghdad and remained there until his death in 998. He was a contemporary of the distinguished scientists Abū Sahl al-Qūhī and al-Sijzi who were in Baghdad at the time and others such as Abu Nasr Mansur, Abu-Mahmud Khojandi, Kushyar Gilani and al-Biruni. In Baghdad, he received patronage from members of the Buyid court.

==Astronomy==
Abu al-Wafa&#x27; was the first to build a wall quadrant to observe the sky. It has been suggested that he was influenced by the works of al-Battani as the latter described a quadrant instrument in his &quot;Kitāb az-Zīj&quot;. His use of the concept of the tangent helped solve problems involving right-angled spherical triangles. He developed a new technique to calculate sine tables, allowing him to construct more accurate tables than his predecessors.

In 997, he participated in an experiment to determine the difference in local time between his location, Baghdad, and that of al-Biruni (who was living in Kath, now a part of Uzbekistan). The result was very close to present-day calculations, showing a difference of approximately 1 hour between the two longitudes. Abu al-Wafa is also known to have worked with Abū Sahl al-Qūhī, who was a famous maker of astronomical instruments. While what is extant from his works lacks theoretical innovation, his observational data were used by many later astronomers, including al-Biruni.

===&quot;Almagest&quot;===
Among his works on astronomy, only the first seven treatises of his &quot;Almagest&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Majisṭī&quot;) are now extant. The work covers numerous topics in the fields of plane and spherical trigonometry, planetary theory, and solutions to determine the direction of Qibla.

==Mathematics==
He defined the tangent function, and he established several trigonometric identities in their modern form, where the ancient Greek mathematicians had expressed the equivalent identities in terms of chords. The trigonometric identities he introduced were:

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3

He may have discovered the law of sines for spherical triangles, however, other scholars like Abu-Mahmud Khojandi have been credited with the same achievement:

:formula_4

where formula_5 are the sides of the triangle (measured in radians on the unit sphere) and formula_6 are the opposing angles.

Some sources suggest that he introduced the tangent function, although other sources give the credit for this innovation to al-Marwazi.

<doc id="1189487" wikidata="Q728170" url="?curid=1189487" title="Exodus (band)">
<text>Exodus is an American thrash metal band formed in 1979 in Richmond, California. Their current lineup consists of guitarists Gary Holt and Lee Altus, bassist Jack Gibson, drummer Tom Hunting, and lead vocalist Rob Dukes. There are no original members left in Exodus other than Hunting, who departed from the band twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Exodus is also notable for featuring a then-unknown Kirk Hammett, who was the band&#x27;s lead guitarist from its inception until his departure in 1983, when he left to join fellow Bay Area thrash metal band Metallica. Holt (who replaced original guitarist Tim Agnello in 1981) has been the most consistent member throughout various lineup changes and breakups, and is the only member to appear on all of Exodus&#x27; recordings. Much of the band&#x27;s career has also been affected by feuds between both band members and record companies, two extended hiatuses, deaths of former band members, and drug addictions.

Since its formation, Exodus has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, one compilation album, and a re-recording of their first album. The band had particular success during the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums: &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; (1985), &quot;Pleasures of the Flesh&quot; (1987), and &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot; (1989). The critical praise given to &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot; garnered attention from major labels, including Capitol Records, with whom Exodus signed in 1989 and released two albums for the label: &quot;Impact Is Imminent&quot; (1990) and &quot;Force of Habit&quot; (1992). After their first breakup in 1993 and a short-lived reunion during 1997–1998, Exodus reunited once again in 2001, and since then, they have released six more studio albums, starting with and including &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot; (2004), which reignited Exodus&#x27; popularity and is considered to be a key part in the early-to-mid-2000s thrash metal revival movement. The band&#x27;s eleventh and latest studio album, &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot;, was released in 2021. Exodus is currently working on new material for their next studio album for a 2026 release. 

Along with Metallica, Exodus is often credited as pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, and have been referred to as one of the region&#x27;s so-called &quot;Big Six&quot; alongside Testament, Death Angel, Lȧȧz Rockit, Forbidden, and Vio-lence. Exodus has sold over five million albums worldwide, and they are also considered to be one of the &quot;Big Eight&quot; of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill, and Death Angel. 

==History==
===Formation and early years (1979–1984)===

Exodus was formed in 1979 by guitarists Kirk Hammett and Tim Agnello, drummer and vocalist Tom Hunting, and vocalist Keith Stewart, while they attended high school together. The band added bass guitarist Carlton Melson in 1980, and the quintet began making a name for themselves playing backyard parties and various school functions. They played mostly cover songs in the vein of 1970s hard rock and the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) acts but also developed some of their own original songs. Stewart soon left the band and Hunting became the band&#x27;s sole vocalist for some time. Melson was replaced in 1981 by bass guitarist Jeff Andrews. Agnello would also leave the group, moving to New York City and staying involved in the music industry as a guitar player, manager, and writer. This left Exodus to perform as a power trio until a replacement was found in Hammett&#x27;s friend and Exodus roadie Gary Holt.

Also in 1981, Hammett met El Cerrito resident Paul Baloff at a North Berkeley house party, a friendship that was started – according to Hammett – by their shared admiration for punk rock and 1970s heavy metal music. Baloff became the band&#x27;s lead vocalist and the quintet recorded a three-track demo tape in 1982, consisting of three songs &quot;Whipping Queen&quot;, &quot;Death and Domination&quot; and &quot;Warlord&quot;, a release which would be Hammett&#x27;s only recording with Exodus until 2014. The band&#x27;s music began to incorporate elements of hardcore punk into their NWOBHM roots, and Exodus was considered a pioneer of the Bay Area thrash metal scene. In November 1982, Exodus opened a show at the Old Waldorf club in San Francisco for Metallica, a then-relatively unknown (and unsigned) band from Los Angeles. As the band began playing more shows in Bay Area clubs, they gained a large, fervent fanbase known for their violent concert behavior.

In April 1983, Hammett left Exodus to replace Dave Mustaine in Metallica on the recommendation of manager and producer Mark Whitaker, leaving Holt to effectively take creative control of the band. Hammett was replaced short term by Mike Maung, followed by Evan McCaskey, before the band finally found a permanent replacement in guitarist Rick Hunolt. Jeff Andrews also left to start an early incarnation of pioneering death metal band Possessed, and was replaced by bass guitarist Rob McKillop.

In the spring of 1984, Exodus entered Turk Street Studios with producer Doug Piercy (then-guitarist of Anvil Chorus and later Heathen) to record demos of songs that would later appear on their debut album. The band was signed to New York-based Torrid Records and Exodus entered Prairie Sun Recording Studios in Cotati that summer.

===&quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; and rise in popularity (1984–1991)===

The band recorded their debut album, &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot;, in the summer of 1984 with the band&#x27;s manager Mark Whitaker producing. Concert photos from their 1984 performance at Aquatic Park&#x27;s Eastern Front Metal Festival (with Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies) and at Ruthie&#x27;s Inn (with Megadeth and Slayer) were included on the album sleeve inserts. Originally titled &quot;A Lesson in Violence&quot;, the album was not released until April 1985 amidst creative and business setbacks. Whilst &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; is considered a highly influential thrash metal album today, critics have regarded the delay in its release as having hindered the impact the album could have had. As AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia would later write in his review for the album, &quot;Had it been released immediately after it was recorded in 1984, Exodus&#x27; &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; might be regarded today alongside Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; as one of the landmark albums responsible for launching the thrash metal wave.&quot; Exodus promoted the album by going on tour with Venom and Slayer. Four songs from their performance of April 5, 1985 at Studio 54 in New York City were filmed and released on home video as &quot;Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge&quot;. The band subsequently toured or played selected shows with Exciter, Megadeth, Anthrax, King Diamond, Possessed, D.R.I., Nuclear Assault and Hirax.
Shortly after touring for &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; was complete, Baloff was fired from the band allegedly due to his behavior related to alcohol and substance abuse. He was replaced by Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza, who had previously been the lead vocalist for Legacy, a precursor of fellow Bay Area thrashers Testament. Baloff went on to form the band Piranha in 1987.

Exodus&#x27; lineup remained stable for the recording of their next two albums, and the underground success attained with &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; would lead to the group&#x27;s signing to Sony/Combat Records, who released the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Pleasures of the Flesh&quot; in October 1987. The album was engineered by a then-unknown Sylvia Massy, who would go on to produce two releases by progressive metal band Tool. In support of &quot;Pleasures of the Flesh&quot;, Exodus toured with Anthrax, Celtic Frost, M.O.D., Lȧȧz Rockit and Testament.

The group&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;, was released in January 1989. A music video for the song &quot;The Toxic Waltz&quot; would receive consistent rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. Promotion for the album included Exodus embarking on the U.S. Headbangers Ball Tour with Anthrax and Helloween, which brought the band to a wider audience. Early in the tour, drummer Tom Hunting left the band for health and personal reasons. Vio-lence drummer Perry Strickland was quickly brought into the fold as a temporary replacement for the remainder of the tour, and John Tempesta would fill the position on a permanent basis until the band&#x27;s first breakup in 1993. &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot; reached No. 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

After the success of &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;, Exodus signed a multi-album deal with Capitol Records in 1989. The band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Impact Is Imminent&quot; was released in June 1990. Despite being released on a major label, &quot;Impact Is Imminent&quot; was not as successful as &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot; and debuted at No. 137 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Until the release of &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; in 2014, &quot;Impact Is Imminent&quot; was Exodus&#x27; last album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Exodus spent the latter half of 1990 touring in support of the album, including North America with Suicidal Tendencies and Pantera. Due to their label refusing to pay tour support, the world tour for &quot;Impact for Imminent&quot; was cut short; they were originally slated to tour Europe with Annihilator and Judas Priest as part of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Painkiller&quot; tour (where Exodus was replaced by Pantera), and the band was also reportedly intended to be the replacement for Death Angel as the support act of the Clash of the Titans tour in North America with Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax before the offer went to the then-up-and-coming band Alice in Chains.

In 1991, the band released their first live album, &quot;Good Friendly Violent Fun&quot;, which was recorded at The Fillmore on July 14, 1989.

===&quot;Force of Habit&quot;, hiatus, and first reunion (1991–2000)===
After the release of &quot;Good Friendly Violent Fun&quot;, the band toured sporadically for a year. Bass guitarist McKillop was replaced by Michael Butler before the group recorded and released their next studio album titled &quot;Force of Habit&quot; in 1992. This album was something of a departure from the band&#x27;s signature sound, containing several slower, &quot;heavier&quot; songs with less emphasis on the thrash aspect of their older material. The 11-minute song &quot;Architect of Pain&quot; is a good example of the change of direction, having a much slow and progressive, grinding feel than the usual high tempo thrash they had become known for. After touring for &quot;Force of Habit&quot; was completed, behind-the-scenes issues as well as a changing musical environment prompted the band to split up.

Holt and Hunting formed the groove/thrash metal outfit Wardance in the mid-1990s, playing several shows around the Bay Area and recording a four-song demo, but the group never gained momentum and eventually disbanded.

Holt and Hunting reunited with Baloff and Hunolt for a short Exodus tour in 1997. The lineup was completed with Wardance bassist Jack Gibson. They released a live album titled &quot;Another Lesson in Violence&quot; recorded at the Trocadero Transfer in front of a home town audience. However, the group disbanded again the following year, in part due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way promotion for the live album was handled, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed, but never released due to a financial dispute.

===Second reunion, &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot;, and switching singers (2001–2004)===
In 2001, Exodus reformed once again with the 1997 lineup, initially to play the Thrash of the Titans concert, which was held as a benefit for Chuck Billy and Chuck Schuldiner, both of whom were battling cancer. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play shows in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.

However, on February 2, 2002, Paul Baloff died after suffering a stroke. Former vocalist Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza was brought back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments. Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff&#x27;s death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio album. The result was 2004&#x27;s &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot;, released on Nuclear Blast Records. An oddity of the recording sessions was that one track, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, was dropped under mysterious circumstances. The song chronicled Exodus&#x27; time under Century Media (of which Nuclear Blast is a subsidiary). Although it was publicly denied, rumors swirled that Century Media forced the song off the record. &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; was replaced with &quot;Impaler&quot;, a song which was written when Kirk Hammett was still in the band, and was previously featured on the &quot;Another Lesson in Violence&quot; live record. Despite selling fewer than 15,000 copies in its first year of release, &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot; received generally positive reviews from fans and critics alike, and is now considered to be an important part of the 2000s thrash metal revival movement. Throughout 2004, Exodus toured worldwide in support of the album.

In September 2004, Souza once again left the band due to business and personal differences. This led to a bitter feud between himself and Holt, who subsequently issued a statement in which he was heavily critical of Souza, claiming he had suddenly left the band while on tour only a day before they were due to leave for a show in Mexico City. In retrospective accounts, both Holt and Souza stated that the reasons for the split were primarily financial: Souza had a full time job as a union carpenter having to care for his family, but his managers posed him an ultimatum as a result of his continued absence from his day job due to touring.

Exhumed frontman Matt Harvey filled in for the Mexico City date and Steev Esquivel (Defiance and Skinlab) played on the fall South American dates. The band eventually found a permanent replacement in Rob Dukes.

===Rob Dukes era (2005–2014)===

In 2005, Rick Hunolt left the band to focus on his family, and was replaced by Heathen guitarist Lee Altus. Tom Hunting also took leave of the band following a re-occurrence of the nervous problems that led to his initial departure in 1989. Hunting was replaced with Paul Bostaph, who had previously played with Slayer and Testament. The revamped lineup released the album &quot;Shovel Headed Kill Machine&quot; in 2005. The tour for the album led to extensive travel of North America, Europe, and Japan, as well as their first-ever visit to Australia.

Hunting returned to the band in March 2007 in time to record and release their eighth studio album &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A&quot;. They performed at the Wacken Open Air Festival in the summer of 2008. In April 2009, Exodus embarked on a co-headlining North American tour with Kreator and also featuring Belphegor, Warbringer, and Epicurean. Exodus then went on tour supporting Arch Enemy along with Arsis and Mutiny Within.

Exodus provided the voices of the customers at the Duncan Hills Coffee Shop and five of the sick people in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;.

Exodus released a re-recording of their 1985 debut album &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; entitled &quot;Let There Be Blood&quot; in 2008. Gary Holt released the following statement about the band&#x27;s decision to revisit their debut album: &quot;After many years in the planning and discussion stage, we have finally completed the re-recording of &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot;. We have decided to call it &quot;Let There Be Blood&quot; and it is our way of paying homage to [late singer] Paul Baloff by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are. We aren&#x27;t trying to replace the original; that&#x27;s impossible anyway. We are just giving these songs the benefit of modern production. It&#x27;s something we talked about before Paul&#x27;s death and it&#x27;s always been important to us to do. We were super excited about entering the studio once again to record these classics, and now it&#x27;s back to writing the next studio record!&quot;

The album &quot;Exhibit B: The Human Condition&quot; was recorded in northern California with British producer Andy Sneap (Megadeth, Arch Enemy, Kreator) and released on Nuclear Blast Records in May 2010. The band was included on Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; 20th anniversary tour, along with Testament. Exodus was featured on the cover of &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine&#x27;s June 2010 issue, with a feature article on them.


Exodus co-headlined with Kreator, Suicidal Angels and Death Angel on the Thrashfest tour in late 2010 and were one of the headlining bands at Wacken Open Air 2011.

Exodus opened for Rob Zombie and Slayer in 2011 on the Hell on Earth tour. Gary Holt filled in for Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman during the tour after Hanneman contracted necrotizing fasciitis caused by a spider bite. Holt filled in for Hanneman again on Slayer&#x27;s next tour in the summer of 2012. When Exodus also toured in the summer of 2012, guitarist Rick Hunolt (who left Exodus in 2005) filled in for Holt. Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O&#x27;Brien also filled in for Holt during this time. Upon Hanneman&#x27;s death in 2013, Holt became his permanent replacement but assured fans that Exodus would continue.

On February 4, 2012, a Paul Baloff Memorial Reunion Concert was held at the Oakland Metro Opera House. Former and current Exodus members in attendance included Kirk Hammett, Rick Hunolt, Gary Holt, Jeff Andrews, Lee Altus, Rob Dukes, Tom Hunting and Jack Gibson. It was the first time they had all played together since 1983. The band was confirmed for the Graspop Festival and for the Hellfest in June 2012. By the summer of 2012, Exodus had begun writing new material for their tenth studio album. On March 27, it was announced that the band entered the studio and were well into recording drum tracks, and the album was expected for a fall 2014 release.

===Reunion with Steve Souza (2014–2025)===
On June 8, 2014, Exodus announced that vocalist Rob Dukes had left the band, and was replaced by Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza, making this the second time he had rejoined the band. Souza stepped in to record vocals for the new album, the first to feature him since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot;. The bands tenth studio album &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot;, was released on October 14, 2014. Original guitarist and founding member Kirk Hammett made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Salt the Wound&quot;, marking his first recording with Exodus since the 1982 demo. The album received positive reviews from music critics upon its release, and peaked at  38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the band&#x27;s highest chart position to that point. Heathen guitarist Kragen Lum was brought in to replace Gary Holt for several live dates while Holt performed and recorded with Slayer. Exodus toured throughout 2015 in support of &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot;, performing at that year&#x27;s edition of Australian Soundwave Festival, which was held across two weekends, and along with Shattered Sun, they supported Testament on their &quot;Dark Roots of Thrash II&quot; tour in the spring. Exodus then toured around Europe in June, including two nights at the Underworld in London.

Writing for the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; began as early as 2016, but actual recording of the album was uncertain due to Holt&#x27;s involvement with Slayer. In 2017, drummer Tom Hunting said that the band had several songs written, with the remainder still being worked on. Souza explained that the material did not sound like a continuation of &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot;, but rather &quot;a lot of records put together&quot;. Hunting said that the album could include another appearance by Kirk Hammett and a possible guest appearance by former guitarist Rick Hunolt. Progress was slow in the coming years, mostly interrupted by both Exodus&#x27; constant touring and Holt&#x27;s commitment to Slayer&#x27;s farewell tour. Recording of the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album began in September 2020. Holt revealed on Instagram two months later that the title of album would be &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot; and it would be released in June 2021.

Former members Rick Hunolt and Rob Dukes joined the band on stage at The Chapel in San Francisco for a one-off reunion show in July 2017. Exodus appeared at the 2018 edition of the Rockharz Open Air in Germany, as one of the early bands on the main stage. The band also headlined the 2018 installment of the MTV Headbangers Ball European Tour (along with Death Angel, Suicidal Angels and Sodom) from late November to mid-December 2018, and toured Europe with Testament and Death Angel in February and March 2020 by taking part in The Bay Strikes Back tour.

On April 13, 2021, three days after his 56th birthday, it was announced that drummer Tom Hunting had been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach. As the result of his health issues, the band also announced that the release of &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot; would be delayed to November 2021. Exodus supported the album with a spring 2022 tour in North America with Testament and Death Angel, as part of the Bay Strikes Back tour, which was initially supposed to take place in the fall of 2021 but the COVID-19 pandemic meant postponing the tour to next year. While Hunting was recovering from his cancer surgery, the band recruited drummer John Tempesta for the August 22 show in Las Vegas and the September 11 show in Cave-In-Rock. Hunting rejoined Exodus for their appearance at the Aftershock Festival in Sacramento on October 7, 2021. The band continued to tour behind &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot; in Europe and North America throughout the summer and fall of 2022, again with Testament and Death Angel, followed by another North American tour in January and February 2023 with Anthrax and Black Label Society. Due to &quot;family concerns&quot;, guitarist Lee Altus did not participate in the European tour, and he was filled in by Brandon Ellis of The Black Dahlia Murder.

About two weeks after the release of &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot;, Holt spoke to &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; about a potential follow-up album. When the interviewer reminded him to &quot;be careful about losing [his] cell phone&quot;, in reference to a similar incident in which Metallica and original Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett lost his cell phone containing riffs that he had recorded for &quot;Hardwired... to Self-Destruct&quot;, Holt responded: &quot;I have my stuff backed up, but if I lose my phone, I wouldn&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ve used the stuff I have really wanted to and by the time we do the next album, I&#x27;ll probably record another thousand riffs that I don&#x27;t listen back to.&quot; In a December 2021 interview with &quot;Guitar.com&quot;, Holt promised that there would not be another seven-year gap in between two studio albums.

On June 20, 2023, it was announced that Exodus had parted ways with Nuclear Blast after 20 years on the label, and they were signed to Napalm Records. A few days later, Holt confirmed via Instagram that he was &quot;fully in writing mode now, assembling the pieces of the next album opener.&quot; Souza announced in October 2023 that the band would enter the studio around March or April 2024 to begin recording their new album, which was expected to be released by September of that year; he would later clarify that studio plans were pushed back to May 2024 due to slow progress and he had not yet heard anything that the members of Exodus were writing. Holt stated in an interview with &quot;Full Metal Jackie&quot; in August 2024 that the band would record their new album in early 2025. 

On April 10, 2024, Exodus announced that a new live album, titled &quot;British Disaster: The Battle of &#x27;89 (Live at the Astoria)&quot;, would be released on May 31. It was recorded live at the London Astoria on March 8, 1989 during the band&#x27;s &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot; tour. On November 1, 2024, the band released their cover version of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Beating Around the Bush&quot;.

===Souza&#x27;s third departure and Dukes&#x27; return (2025–present)===
On January 15, 2025, it was announced that frontman Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza and Exodus had parted ways, and the band had replaced him with his predecessor Rob Dukes, stating: &quot;We are beyond stoked to have Rob back ripping up the stage with us and he&#x27;s looking forward to crushing everything like only he can.&quot; Exodus also announced its plans to record a new album with Dukes. Souza revealed that he was fired from the band, which was later confirmed by Exodus themselves.

Exodus will play its first shows with Dukes in 11 years at the UC Theatre in Berkeley on April 25, 2025, and at the House of Blues in Anaheim the next day; both of those shows will see the band commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of their debut album &quot;Bonded by Blood&quot; and will also celebrate what would have been former singer Paul Baloff&#x27;s 65th birthday. Holt announced in February 2025 that the band will release their new album in 2026.

==Musical style, legacy and influences==

Exodus has been credited as one of the pioneers of the thrash metal genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s, and is often credited as the first Bay Area thrash metal band to exist, predating Metallica, who was originally from Los Angeles. Exodus is also considered to be a member of the &quot;Big Eight&quot; of the genre, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill, and Death Angel. Alternatively, Exodus has been called one of &quot;The Other Big Four&quot; or &quot;The Second Big Four&quot; of thrash metal, alongside Testament, Overkill, and Death Angel.
The members of Exodus have cited numerous artists as an influence or inspiration to their sound, including AC/DC, Angel Witch, Black Sabbath, David Bowie, Roy Buchanan, Glen Campbell, the Clash, Ry Cooder, Deep Purple, Diamond Head, Discharge, the Doors, the Exploited, GBH, Jimi Hendrix, Iron Maiden, Elton John, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Mercyful Fate, Gary Moore, Motörhead, Nazareth, Ted Nugent, Pink Floyd, Queen, Rainbow, the Sex Pistols, Sweet Savage, Thin Lizzy, Tygers of Pan Tang, UFO, Van Halen, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Venom.

Many thrash metal bands, including Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Death Angel, Vio-lence, Sepultura, Flotsam and Jetsam, Annihilator, Dark Angel, Forbidden, Sacred Reich, Heathen, Artillery, Havok, and Evile, as well as other bands such as Obituary, Cannibal Corpse, Darkthrone, Fear Factory, Eyehategod, and Primal Fear, have cited Exodus as an influence or inspiration to their music.

&quot;Loudwire.com&quot; placed Exodus at number five on its list of the 10 Best Thrash Bands of All Time, calling them &quot;The original kings of the Bay Area thrash scene&quot;, and saying that &quot;While their uncompromising sound and uneven output in the coming decades kept world domination and platinum success ever at bay, you&#x27;d be hard passed to finger any other band, short of Slayer, perhaps, that&#x27;s flown the thrash flag as proudly and unwaveringly as Exodus.&quot; In 1989, Brad Tolinski of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine wrote that, &quot;If Exodus is a speed metal equivalent of the Rolling Stones, then New York-based Anthrax must surely be the genre&#x27;s The Beatles.&quot; In 2002, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV noted that Exodus &quot;was instrumental in pioneering thrash metal — a style of music that blended the fury of hardcore and the razor-edged precision of such British bands as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest — and soon became the toast of the Bay Area metal scene, which also included Metallica, Testament, Flotsam &amp; Jetsam and Death Angel.&quot; Ultimate Guitar also referred to Exodus as the &quot;historical bridge between &#x27;The Big Four&#x27; of thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax) and the genre&#x27;s second wave in the late 1980s&quot;, while Ken McIntyre of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; described them as &quot;arguably the most musically violent band in the Bay Area thrash movement.&quot;
===&quot;Big Four&quot; debate===
Due Exodus&#x27; involvement in the early 1980s thrash metal scene, it has been debated among journalists and musicians alike over whether or not Exodus warrants the status of inclusion in the &quot;Big Five&quot; of thrash metal, along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax. Mike McPadden of VH1 stated, &quot;Much is made of Thrash&#x27;s Big Four [...] True devotees know, however, that Big Five is the actual proper figure and that Exodus is the band that completes the quintet.&quot; Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian also stated that, &quot;People talk about the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; all the time, but back then it was really the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; because Exodus were just as important and just as influential as everybody else.&quot; Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine said in a 1990 interview that, in his point of view, Exodus were among the &quot;Big Four&quot; and Anthrax were not. He is quoted saying, &quot;Exodus are a much better band [than Anthrax] – I really like Exodus. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are really great guitar players. I like Scott Ian, but anyone else in that band kind of bores me. Having a disco thing is not what I think having a metal band is all about, and that guy had the audacity to say that he and I should work together! I felt like saying what are you planning to do? Open a disco fashion shop?&quot; Mustaine has also been quoted as saying, &quot;You know, people will say there&#x27;s a whole other generation, like the &#x27;Medium Four&#x27; [laughs], and I think there&#x27;s a lot of great bands that fit that bill, too. But I think probably Exodus, because there was nobody else at the time that had that kind of pull or that kind of importance in the metal community. Granted, it was with Baloff, and Baloff had a voice that you had to have an acquired taste for, but you know, I liked him.&quot;

In addition to Ian and Mustaine, Holt has agreed that Exodus should be included in the &quot;Big Five&quot; of thrash metal because they &quot;were there at the start of thrash metal with Metallica in the real early &#x27;80s. Same thing with Megadeth because Mustaine was a part of Metallica&#x27;s birth and he also created Megadeth.&quot; Frontman Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza has stated that the fact that Exodus was not included in the &quot;Big Four&quot; does not bother him, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard that term many times and it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me. It&#x27;s not the truth. There&#x27;s them, and Overkill, Testament and Exodus. You could also talk about Kreator, Sodom and Destruction, if you want to get down to it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me — I&#x27;m content where I&#x27;m at.&quot;

<text>Camp Shelby is a military post whose South Gate is located at the southern boundary of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on U.S. Highway 49. It is the largest state-owned training site in the nation. During wartime, the camp&#x27;s mission is to serve as a major independent mobilization station of the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center is the largest reserve component training site, covering , allowing up to battalion-level maneuver training, Gunnery Table 8-12, field artillery firing points and a wide range of support facilities. This is the normal Annual Training location for National Guard and Reserve units located in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. However, units from across the country use its assets to support a variety of missions. The 2nd Battalion, 114th Field Artillery conducts its gunnery training and has the bulk of its combat equipment stored in the Mobilization and Annual Training Equipment Site (MATES) located there.

Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center (CSJFTC), encompassing over 525 square kilometers, is located in portions of Perry and Forrest Counties, in south Mississippi. The training center was established during World War I and it has served almost continuously since then as a training site, not only for the Reserve Components of the Army, but also for the Active Components of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The training site consists of a mix of State, Department of Defense, and U.S. Forest Service lands in the DeSoto National Forest.

Encompassing more than , Camp Shelby, Mississippi is the largest state-owned and operated field training center in the United States. It is a training ground for the Abrams M1 Tank, Paladin Howitzers and home to the 3rd Brigade 87th Division Training Support. Camp Shelby serves as a training site for National Guardsmen and Reservists from throughout the country hosting as many as 100,000 personnel annually.

==History==
Camp Shelby was established in 1917. The post was named in honor of Isaac Shelby, Indian fighter, Revolutionary War hero and 1st Governor of Kentucky, by the first troops to train here, the 38th Division.

In 1934, the State of Mississippi acquired the site for use as a summer camp by the National Guard. Because of Camp Shelby&#x27;s natural advantages of climate and location, plus a great variety of terrain including part of the Ragland Hills, it was reopened in 1940 as a federal installation. Some of the divisions that have trained in Mississippi include the 31st, 37th, 38th, 43rd, 63rd, 65th, 69th, 85th, 94th, and the 99th Divisions.

The famous Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Battalion trained here in preparation for World War II (See the 1951 movie &quot;Go For Broke!&quot; and the 2006 movie Only the Brave). Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAC) units also trained here. The post contained a large convalescent hospital and had a prisoner of war camp which housed soldiers of the famous German Afrika Korps. Camp Shelby is also home to the Mississippi Armed Forces Museum. The history of Camp Shelby is significant part of the museum&#x27;s collection.

The post closed shortly after the end of World War II. During the Korean War, Camp Shelby was established as an emergency railhead facility.

In the summer of 1954, non-divisional National Guard units trained at Camp Shelby and in 1956, it was designated a permanent training site by Continental Army Command (now FORSCOM). Over 5,000 troops were processed through Camp Shelby during Desert Storm operations.

The 199th Light Infantry Brigade trained at Camp Shelby from September to November 1966 in preparation for deployment to Vietnam from Fort Benning Georgia. The 199th was the only combat unit to train at Camp Shelby during the Vietnam War.

Camp Shelby was federalized as a FORSCOM Mobilization Center on June 6, 2004. Since then, several Regimental or Brigade Combat Teams have mobilized through Camp Shelby including the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment (Tennessee Army National Guard); the 155th Heavy Brigade Combat Team (MS ARNG); the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division (PA ARNG); the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division (PA ARNG) ; the 53rd Brigade Combat Team (FL ARNG); the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division (MN ARNG); the 41st Brigade Combat Team (OR ARNG); the 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (LA ARNG); the 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team (ID ARNG), the 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (NY ARNG), and the 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (GA ARNG).

U.S. Navy Seabee units homeported or mobilized from the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Gulfport, Mississippi utilize Camp Shelby as the site for their Field Training Exercises (FTX).

Camp Shelby is also home to the Youth Challenge Academy (a military structured GED and State High School diploma program established in 1994 to aid Mississippi High school dropouts, ages 16 to 18, designed and operated by the National Guard Bureau).

In mid-2007, the Air National Guard opened a new combat training runway at Camp Shelby. The Shelby Auxiliary Field One is one of only two facilities in the world designed for C-17 Globemaster III short-field landing training. It was constructed to meet Air Force C-17 training requirements.

Contingency Operating Location 3 at Camp Shelby is used for Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps field training.

Camp Shelby also serves as the training facility for the Mississippi State Guard annual training and is home to the 310th Battalion (MSSG) 315th MP Co.

<doc id="1189497" wikidata="Q34129" url="?curid=1189497" title="Tigre language">
<text>Tigre (, ), also known as Tigrayit (), is an Ethio-Semitic language spoken in the Horn of Africa, primarily by the Tigre people of Eritrea. It is believed to be the most closely related living language to Ge&#x27;ez, which is still in use as the liturgical language of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Tigre has a lexical similarity of 71% with Ge’ez and of 64% with Tigrinya. As of 1997, Tigre was spoken by approximately 800,000 Tigre people in Eritrea. The Tigre mainly inhabit western Eritrea, though they also reside in the northern highlands of Eritrea and its extension into the adjacent parts of Sudan, as well as Eritrea&#x27;s Red Sea coast north of Zula. There is a small number of Tigre speakers in Sudan, as well as communities of speakers found in the diaspora.

The Tigre people are not to be confused with their neighbors to the south, the Tigrinya people of Eritrea and the Tigrayans of Ethiopia, both of whom speak Tigrinya. Tigrinya is also derived from the parent Geʽez tongue, but is quite distinct from Tigre despite the similarity in name.

==Dialects==
There are several dialects of Tigre, some of them are; Mansa’ (Mensa), Habab, Barka, Semhar, Algeden, Senhit (Ad-Tekleis, Ad-Temariam, Bet-Juk, Marya Kayah) and Dahalik, which is spoken in the Dahlak Archipelago. Intelligibility between the dialects is above 91% (except Dahalik), where intelligibility between Dahalik and the other dialects is between 24% and 51%.

Tigre speakers in Sudan also call the language &quot;hāsā&quot;. However the term &#x27;Hasa&#x27;, and in other variations of names such as &#x27;Xasa&#x27; or &#x27;Khasa&#x27; is considered pejorative by the Tigre.

==Vocabulary==
===Numerals===
The cardinal and ordinal numbers in Tigre are as follows:

Ordinal numbers have both feminine and masculine form. To describe the masculine form -&quot;ay&quot; is added and respective -&quot;ayt&quot; to describe the feminine form.

==Phonology==
Tigre has preserved the two pharyngeal consonants of Ge&#x27;ez. The Ge&#x27;ez vowel inventory has almost been preserved except that the two vowels which are phonetically close to and [a] seem to have evolved into a pair of phonemes which have the same quality (the same articulation) but differ in length; [a] vs. . The original phonemic distinction according to quality survives in Tigrinya. The vowel , traditionally named &quot;first order vowel&quot;, is most commonly transcribed &quot;ä&quot; in Semitic linguistics.

The phonemes of Tigre are displayed below in both International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols (indicated by the IPA brackets) and the symbols common (though not universal) among linguists who work on Ethiopian Semitic languages. For the long vowel , the symbol &#x27;ā&#x27; is used per Raz (1983). Three consonants, /p, p&#x27;, x/, occur only in a small number of loanwords, hence they are written in parentheses.

As in other Ethiopian Semitic languages, the phonemic status of is questionable; it may be possible to treat it as an epenthetic vowel that is introduced to break up consonant clusters.


===Consonant length===
Consonant length is phonemic in Tigre (that is, a pair of words can be distinct by consonant length alone), although there are few such minimal pairs. Some consonants do not occur long; these include the pharyngeal consonants, the glottal consonants, , and . In this language, long consonants arise almost solely by gemination as a morphological process; there are few, if any, long consonants in word roots. Gemination is especially prominent in verb morphology.

==Grammar==

These notes use the spelling adopted by Camperio (1936 – see bibliography) which seems to approximate to Italian rules.

Nouns are of two genders, masculine and feminine. 
*Indefinite article: masculine uoro አሮ e.g. uoro ennas አሮ እነስ – a man; feminine hatte ሐተ e.g. hatte sit ሐተ እሲት – a woman.
* The definite article, &quot;the&quot;, when expressed, is la ለ e.g. ለጸሐይ ወ ለወርሕ – the sun and the moon.

As we might expect from a Semitic language, specifically feminine forms, where they exist, are often formed of an element with t:
* masculine: አድግ ʼadəg- donkey, ass; feminine: እድግሀት ʼədgəhat – she-ass;
* masculine: ከልብ kalb – dog; feminine: ከልበት kalbat – bitch;
* masculine: ከድመይ kadmay – serving man; ከድመይት kadmayt – serving-woman;
* masculine: መምበ mamba – lord, master; መምበይት mambayt – lady, mistress.

In a similar way, sound-changes can also mark the difference between singular and plural:
* ነጉስ nəgus – king; negüs – kings; 
* በሐር bahar – sea; አብሑር ʼabhur – seas; 
* እሲት ʼəsit – woman; አንስ ʼans – women;

* በገዐት baga‘āt – one sheep; አበግዕ ʼābagəʽ – sheep, plural;
* አርዌ ʼārwē – Snake; አረዊት ārawit – snakes, plural;
* ሖግ ḥog – foot; ሐነግ ḥanag – feet; plural
* እገር ʼəgər – foot; አእጋር ʼā’əgār feet; plural 
* አዘን ʼəzən – ear; አእዛን ʼaʼəzān – ears;
* ሰዐት saʽat – hour; ሰዓታትsaʽātāt – hours;
* አንፍ ʼānəf – nose; አንፎታት ʼanfotāt – noses;
* ህዳይ hədāy – wedding; ህዳያት hədāyāt – weddings;
* አብ ʼāb – father; አበው ʼābaw – fathers;
* እም ʼəm – mother; እመወት ʼəmawat – mothers;
* ኮኮብ kokob – star;ከዋክብ kawākəb – stars;
* ጓነ gʷāna – foreigner;ጓኖታት gʷānotāt – foreigners;
* ረአስ raʼas – head; አርእስ ʼarʼəs – heads;
* ጸፍር ṣəfər – paw, hoof; አጸፍር ʼāṣfār – claws, hooves;
* ከብድ kabəd – belly; አክቡድ ʼākbud – bellies.
* ልበስ ləbas- ልበሰት ləbasat clothes

Personal pronouns distinguish &quot;you, masculine&quot; and &quot;you, feminine&quot; in both singular and plural:
*አነ ʼana – I, me
*እንታ ʼənta – you, singular, masculine
*እንቲ ʼənti – you, singular, feminine
*ህቱ hətu – he, him, it (masc.)
*ህታ həti – she, her, it (fem.)

*እንትን ʼəntən – you, plural, feminine
*ህቶም hətom – they, them, masculine
*ህተን həten – they, them, feminine

The possessive pronouns appear (a) suffixed to the noun, (b) as separate words:

*my – (a) -ya የ example: kətābya ክታብየ- my book; (b) nāy ናየ with masculine nouns; nāya ናየ with feminine nouns; 
*your (sing. mas. &amp; fem.) – (a) -ka ካ example: kətābka ክታብካ- your book; (b) with masc. nāyka ናይካ, with fem. nāyki ናይኪ;

==Writing system==
Since around 1889, the Ge&#x27;ez script (Ethiopic script) has been used to write the Tigre language. Tigre speakers formerly used Arabic more widely as a lingua franca. The Bible has been translated into the Tigre language.

===Ge&#x27;ez script===
Ge&#x27;ez script is an abugida, with each character representing a consonant+vowel combination. Ge&#x27;ez and its script are also called Ethiopic. The script has been modified slightly to write Tigre.

<text>Marriott International, Inc. is an American multinational company that operates, franchises, and licenses lodging brands that include hotel, residential, and timeshare properties. Marriott International owns over 36 hotel and timeshare brands with 9,000 locations and 1,597,380 rooms across its network (as of 2023). Marriott International is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. The company is the successor to the hospitality division of the Marriott Corporation, founded by J. Willard Marriott (1900–1985) and his wife Alice Marriott (1907–2000).

==Profile==
Marriott International is the largest hotel company in the world by the number of available rooms. It has 36 brands with 9,361 properties containing 1,706,331 rooms in 144 countries and territories. Of these 9,361 properties 1,981 are managed but not owned by Marriott, 7,192 are owned and managed by independent hospitality companies under franchise agreements with Marriott, and 51 are both owned and managed by Marriott. The company also operates 20 hotel reservation centers.

Marriott International, Inc. was formed in 1993 when Marriott Corporation split into two companies: Marriott International, Inc., which franchises and manages properties, and Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels &amp; Resorts), which owns properties.

Since the founders were missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, copies of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; are provided in hotel rooms in addition to the Bible.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
Marriott Corporation was founded by John Willard Marriott in 1927 when he and his wife, Alice Marriott, opened a root beer stand in Washington, D.C. After serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New England, Marriott traveled to Washington, D.C. where he experienced the humid summer weather of the city. Marriott was convinced that what residents of the city needed was a place to get a cool drink, and so after returning to Utah and graduating from The University of Utah, Marriott purchased the rights to franchise an A&amp;W Root Beer stand in Columbia Heights. The first summer saw brisk business, but as cold weather approached they realized the seasonal nature of their business and received permission from A&amp;W to start selling food. He named the restaurant Hot Shoppes and watched as it grew in popularity. Always looking for new ways to improve his company, he bought the vacant lot next to one of his Hot Shoppes, removed the curb, and began offering the first drive-in service on the East Coast. This move popularized the restaurants, and by 1932, the Marriott&#x27;s owned 7 Hot Shoppes in the D.C. area. In 1953, Hot Shoppes, Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.

The company opened its first hotel, the Marriott Motor Hotel, in Arlington, Virginia, on January 16, 1957. It cost $9 per night, plus an extra $1 for every person that was in the car. Its second hotel, the Marriott Key Bridge Motor Hotel in Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia, opened in 1959, and was Marriott International&#x27;s longest continuously operating hotel until its closure in July 2021.

Hot Shoppes, Inc. was renamed the Marriott Corporation in 1967.

In 1972, the Marriott lodging division acquired the Greek-based Sun Line cruise line, which it owned until 1987.

In 1976, the company opened two theme parks, each named Marriott&#x27;s Great America, in California and Illinois. Marriott sold the parks in 1984, with the California park bought by the City of Santa Clara and the Illinois park bought by Bally Manufacturing, then the parent company of the Six Flags Corporation(both are now owned by Six Flags).

===Marriott International ===
Marriott International, Inc. was formed in 1993 when Marriott Corporation split into two companies: Marriott International, Inc., which franchises and manages properties, and Host Marriott Corporation (now Host Hotels &amp; Resorts), which owns properties.

In 1995, Marriott was the first hotel company to offer online reservations.

In April 1995, Marriott acquired a 49% interest in The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Marriott believed that it could increase sales and profit margins for The Ritz-Carlton, a troubled chain with many properties either losing money or barely breaking even. The cost to Marriott was estimated to have been about $200million in cash and assumed debt. The next year, Marriott spent $331million to acquire The Ritz-Carlton, Atlanta, and buy a majority interest in two properties owned by William Johnson, a real estate developer who had purchased The Ritz-Carlton, Boston in 1983 and expanded his Ritz-Carlton holdings over the next twenty years. Ritz-Carlton expanded into the timeshare market. Ritz Carlton benefited from Marriott&#x27;s reservation system and buying power. In 1998, Marriott acquired majority ownership of The Ritz-Carlton.

In 1997, the company acquired the Renaissance Hotels and Ramada brands from Chow Tai Fook Group and its associate company, New World Development. Marriott International also signed an agreement to manage hotels owned by New World Development. The same year the company also got into the home cleaning business by starting a new venture dubbed HomeSolutions.

In 2001, the Marriott World Trade Center was destroyed during the September 11 attacks.

In 2002, CTF Hotel Holdings Inc., a company that owns a hotel in Hong Kong managed by Marriott, sued Marriott alleging that Marriott engaged in extortion and bribery. According to the allegations, Marriott contracted to receive audio-visual services from Molloy. Marriott paid an inflated amount to Molloy and pocketed the 1.7 million dollars above its fee. Marriott had to return the money to CTF Hotel. CTF Hotel also accused Marriott of accepting bribes from suppliers.

In 2003, the company completed the corporate spin-off of its senior living properties (now part of Sunrise Senior Living) and Marriott Distribution Services. In the same year, the owners of the Marriott-operated, Town Hotels, sued Marriott for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and fraud. They claimed that Marriott along with the Avendra hotel chain violated West Virginia law by contracting with vendors and receiving &quot;sponsorship fees&quot; from them to provide services to Town Hotels, when according to the contract, Marriott was forbidden to profit from the contract except for management fees.
In 2004, the company sold its right to the Ramada brand to Cendant, acquired in 1997.

In 2005, Marriott International and Marriott Vacation Club International were two of the 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the Second inauguration of George W. Bush.

On July 19, 2006, Marriott implemented a smoking ban in all buildings it operated in the United States and Canada effective September 2006.

In 2007, Marriott became the first hotel chain to serve food that is completely free of trans fats at all of its North American properties.

Hotels franchised or operated by the company were affected by the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing, the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing in 2008, and the 2009 Jakarta bombings.

On November 11, 2010, Marriott announced plans to add over 600 hotel properties by 2015, primarily in emerging markets: India, where it planned to have 100 hotel properties, China, and Southeast Asia.

On January 21, 2011, Marriott said that adult movies would not be included in the entertainment offered at new hotels, which would use an Internet-based video on demand system.

In 2011, Mitt Romney received $260,390 in director&#x27;s fees from Marriott International, despite the fact that he had already stepped down from the board of directors to run for President of the United States. His released 2010 tax returns showed earnings in 2010 of $113,881 in director&#x27;s fees from Marriott. In February 2012, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported on Romney&#x27;s years overseeing tax matters for Marriott, which had included several &quot;scams&quot; (quoting John McCain) and legal actions brought against Marriott, which Marriott lost in court, over its manipulations of the U.S. Tax Code.

Effective March 31, 2012, Bill Marriott assumed the role of executive chairman of the company and relinquished the role of chief executive officer to Arne Sorenson.

In December 2012, Guinness World Records recognized the JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, a five star hotel, as the tallest hotel in the world.

In 2013, the owners of the Madison 92nd Street Associates LLC, who contracted with Marriott to manage their hotel, sued Marriott for $400 million, alleging that Marriott had conspired with the workers&#x27; committee. They claimed that Marriott allowed the workers to unionize at the Madison-owned hotel in exchange for not unionizing at Marriott&#x27;s flagship hotels.

On October 3, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined Marriott $600,000 for unlawful use of a &quot;containment&quot; feature of a Wi-Fi monitoring system to deliberately interfere with client-owned networks in the convention space of its Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center in Nashville. The scheme disrupted operation of clients&#x27; mobile phone hotspots via Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks. Marriott International, Inc., the American Hotel and Lodging Association and Ryman Hospitality Properties responded by unsuccessfully petitioning the FCC to change the rules to allow them to continue jamming client-owned networks, a position which they were forced to abandon in early 2015 in response to backlash from clients, mainstream media, major technology companies, and mobile carriers. The incident drew unfavorable publicity to Marriott&#x27;s practice of charging exorbitant fees for Wi-Fi.

On April 1, 2015, Marriott acquired Canadian hotel chain Delta Hotels, which operated 38 hotels at that time.

On November 16, 2015, Marriott announced the acquisition of Starwood for $13billion. A higher offer for Starwood at $14billion from a consortium led by China&#x27;s Anbang Insurance Group was announced March 3, 2016. After Marriott raised its bid to $13.6billion on March 21, Starwood terminated the Anbang agreement and proceeded with the merger with Marriott. Following receipt of regulatory approvals, Marriott closed the merger with Starwood on September 23, 2016, creating the world&#x27;s largest hotel company with over 5700 properties, 1.1million rooms, and a portfolio of 30 brands. The Starwood acquisition gave Marriott a larger non-US presence; approximately 75% of Starwood&#x27;s revenues were from non-US markets.

On November 30, 2018, Marriott disclosed that the former Starwood brands had been subject to a data breach. After the disclosure, Attorney General of New York Barbara Underwood announced an investigation into the data breach. The cyberattack was found to be a part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort that also hacked health insurers and the security clearance files of millions more Americans. The hackers are suspected of working on behalf of the Ministry of State Security, the country&#x27;s Communist-controlled civilian spy agency. Initially, Marriott said that 500 million customers&#x27; personal information had been exposed. In January 2019, the company updated the number of guests affected to &quot;less than 383 million&quot; customers, and claimed many of the customer&#x27;s payment cards had expired. The UK Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office fined Marriott £18 million for breaches to GDPR law that contributed to the breach. Australia&#x27;s Information Commissioner served Marriott an &#x27;enforceable undertaking&#x27; to improve their security.

In 2019 and 2021, Marriott faced an investigation and a class action lawsuit in the US for its practice of charging resort fees that were not included in the room price, with the services included in these &quot;resort fees&quot; unclear. This method is prohibited in many parts of the world and is known as &quot;drip pricing&quot;.

In December 2019, the company acquired Elegant Hotels, operator of 7 hotels in Barbados.

In February 2020, the company discovered a data breach that included the theft of contact information for 5.2 million customers.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company instituted additional cleanliness standards, including requiring the use of electrostatic sprayers with disinfectant, adding disinfecting wipes in all hotel rooms, and removing or re-arranging furniture in public areas to allow more space for social distancing. During the pandemic, global occupancy fell as low as 31%.

President and CEO Arne Sorenson died on February 15, 2021, from pancreatic cancer. On February 23, 2021, Anthony Capuano was appointed to fill Sorensen&#x27;s vacancy as CEO and Director, having previously served as Marriott&#x27;s group president of global development, design and operations.

In November 2021, the company was criticized for refusing to host the World Uyghur Congress at one of its properties in Prague, citing reasons of &quot;political neutrality&quot;.

In August 2022, employees began moving into the company&#x27;s new 21-story, 785,000-square-foot headquarters building on Wisconsin Avenue, ahead of an official opening on September 21. The new building was constructed over four years as part of a $600 million downtown Bethesda campus, together with the adjacent Marriott Bethesda Downtown hotel.

In 2023, a criminal investigation was opened against Marriott in Poland, claiming that it acted fraudulently and unethically against the Lim company, the owner of a Warsaw hotel. During the COVID-19 period, Marriott would not keep up the hotel&#x27;s maintenance and shifted the costs of maintaining the empty hotel to the Lim Company. At the same time Marriott prevented the Lim Company from renting the hotel to the National Health Fund for doctors&#x27; housing or contracting for advertising deals until the Lim Company would pay unwarranted bonuses to Marriott.

Also in the same year, on May 1, Marriott announced that it completed the acquisition of Mexican hotelier Hoteles City Express. By this move, Marriott officially entered the affordable midscale-segment under &quot;City Express by Marriott&quot; brands. The company also launched another brand focusing on budget extended stays called StudioRes in August, and an extension to its Four Points by Sheraton brand called Four Points Express in September.

In August 2024, Marriott announced a long-term licensing agreement with Sonder, adding 10,500 rooms to their portfolio and allowing customers to earn or redeem Marriott Bonvoy points at Sonder properties starting in late 2024. 

==Corporate affairs==
=== Senior leadership ===
From Marriott&#x27;s founding in 1927 to 2012, the company&#x27;s senior leadership was led by members of the Marriott family. In 2012, Arne Sorenson became the first non-Marriott family member to be appointed chief executive; this practice continued when Anthony Capuano was named his successor in 2021. The current practice is members of the Marriott family are named chairman while other company executives are named as chief executive.

===Environment===
Marriott International reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 5,166 Kt (-1,643 /-24.1% y-o-y) and aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

=== Loyalty program ===
Marriott Bonvoy is Marriott&#x27;s current loyalty program and was formed in the February 2019 merger of its three former rewards programs: Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest. Starwood Preferred Guest (also known as SPG) was founded in 1999 as the first in the industry to enforce a policy of no blackout dates, no capacity controls, and online redemption. In 2012, Starwood Preferred Guest began offering lifetime status and a dedicated Starwood ambassador for loyal members. Ritz-Carlton Rewards was founded in 2010. Members were able to receive air miles instead of reward points and able to earn ten points (or two miles) for every dollar spent on any Ritz-Carlton room rates. Despite the restriction of membership to only one of the two programs, members of Ritz-Carlton Rewards were able to earn points in other Marriott hotels, while Marriott Rewards members were able to earn points at a Ritz-Carlton.

==The Luxury Collection==

The Luxury Collection is a brand of Marriott International for luxury properties. It is notable as the first &quot;soft brand&quot; hotel chain. Most hotels of the brand are located in converted historic buildings, including palaces or older hotels. The brand also enlists notable designers to craft luxury travel accessories that are available exclusively on the brand&#x27;s website.

===History===
The Luxury Collection brand began on January 13, 1992, when ITT Sheraton designated 28 of its most expensive hotels and 33 of the Sheraton Towers, as the &quot;ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection&quot;.

In February 1994, ITT Sheraton Hotels and Resorts acquired a controlling interest in CIGA (Compagnia Italiana Grandi Alberghi, or Italian Grand Hotels Company), an Italian international hotel chain that owned several luxury properties in Europe. The majority of the CIGA hotels were folded into The Luxury Collection. CIGA&#x27;s original logo, the four horses of St. Mark, was kept for The Luxury Collection brand logo until 2010; each Luxury Collection hotel now uses its own logo.

In 2011, it embarked on an advertising campaign. In 2012, the brand announced a major expansion in Asia, particularly in China. Also in 2014, the brand signed Danish supermodel Helena Christensen as spokesperson. In 2015, the company launched a $700 million program to renovate properties.

===Properties===
As of December 31, 2020, there were 118 hotels comprising 23,243 rooms operating under the brand. Amongst its several most notable hotels are Hotel Alfonso XIII, Gritti Palace Hotel, IVY Hotel + Residences, Hotel Imperial, ITC Grand Chola, Marqués de Riscal Hotel, The Nines, Palace Hotel, San Francisco, The Park Tower Knightsbridge Hotel, Phoenician Resort, Hotel President Wilson, The St. Anthony Hotel, and Royal Hawaiian Hotel. The Royal Penthouse Suite at Hotel President Wilson in Geneva, part of The Luxury Collection, billed at per night, is listed at the top of the World&#x27;s 15 Most Expensive Hotel Suites list compiled by CNN in 2012.

==Great America parks==
Marriott developed three theme parks, of which two opened: Marriott&#x27;s Great America in Santa Clara, California and Marriott&#x27;s Great America in Gurnee, Illinois. A third site was proposed but never built in the Washington D.C. area, but was cancelled due to strong opposition by surrounding residents. The parks were operated by Marriott from 1976 until 1984, and were themed to celebrate American history. The American-themed areas under Marriott&#x27;s tenure of ownership included &quot;Carousel Plaza&quot; (the first section beyond the main gates); small-town-themed &quot;Hometown Square&quot;; &quot;The Great Midwest Livestock Exposition At County Fair&quot; with a Turn of the Century rural-fair theme; &quot;Yankee Harbor&quot;, inspired by a 19th-century New England port; &quot;Yukon Territory&quot;, resembling a Canadian/Alaskan logging camp; and the French Quarter-modeled &quot;Orleans Place&quot;. At the opening, the parks had nearly identical layouts.

In 1984, Marriott disposed of its theme park division; both parks were sold and today are associated with national theme park chains. The Gurnee location was sold to Six Flags where it operates today as Six Flags Great America. The Santa Clara location was sold to the City of Santa Clara, who retained the underlying property and sold the park to Kings Entertainment Company, renamed Paramount Parks in 1993. From 1993 to 2006, the Santa Clara location was known as Paramount&#x27;s Great America. In 2006, Paramount Parks was acquired by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company; the Santa Clara park operates today as California&#x27;s Great America. In the years after their sale, the layouts of both of the parks have diverged substantially.

<doc id="1189507" wikidata="Q4824359" url="?curid=1189507" title="Australian Koala Foundation">
<text>The Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) is registered Australian charity created in 1986, dedicated to the effective management and conservation of the koala and its habitat. It is the principal non-profit, non-governmental organisation dedicated to the conservation and effective management of the wild koala and its habitat.

In 2023, the AKF finished its signature project, the Koala Habitat Atlas, which took approximately $20m of scientific time and field work to create. The KHA is provided free of charge to members of the public when they are trying to produce scientific proof that koala habitat could be destroyed if development and industry projects are approved.   

The AKF believes that existing laws, like the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (&quot;EPBC Act&quot;) are inadequate to protect the koala and feel that the federal government is wasting time and resources on research at the expense of habitat conservation.

In 2016 and 2019 the AFK declared that koalas were &quot;functionally extinct&quot;, but those claims were subsequently challenged as untrue by one person and AKF still stands by that view. The claim in May 2019 by the AKF that Australia&#x27;s koala population was as low as 80,000 animals was challenged by reports that the true population could be more than 300,000.   

In 2019 the AKF expressed grave concerns over the &quot;EPBC Act&quot;, claiming it did not go far enough to protect koalas.

The 2019–20 Australian bushfire season had a devastating impact on koala habitat and populations. 

The AFK has lobbied for a specific federal koala protection act, akin to the United States&#x27; Bald Eagle Endangered Species Act, which has protected its fauna emblem, the bald eagle, since 1973.

The AKF created &quot;Save the Koala Month&quot;, held annually each September, to raise funds for its work and to ensure that people around the world can celebrate the koala.  

Deborah Tabart has headed the Australian Koala Foundation for 33 years. She is the author of &quot;The Koala Manifesto&quot;, which tells the story of the koala, and offers steps we can take to save the koala. &quot;The Koala Manifesto&quot; calls for ten key actions that will need to happen to save the koala and its habitat, and change our relationship with nature.

A current project of AKF is the Koala Kiss Project. AKF has coined the term &quot;kiss point&quot; to describe the point in the landscape where areas of koala habitat are connected. In some areas koala habitat comes close to each other, but remain separated by divisions of cleared land. AKF is undertaking a huge project to identify and connect these crucial points of habitat.

<doc id="1189508" wikidata="Q7956844" url="?curid=1189508" title="WVII-TV">
<text>WVII-TV (channel 7) is a television station in Bangor, Maine, United States, affiliated with ABC. The station is owned by Rockfleet Broadcasting alongside Fox affiliate WFVX-LD (channel 22). WVII-TV and WFVX-LD share studios on Target Industrial Circle in West Bangor; through a channel sharing agreement, the two stations transmit using WVII-TV&#x27;s spectrum from an antenna on Black Cap Mountain along the Penobscot and Hancock county line.

WVII-TV serves as the default ABC affiliate through cable for the Presque Isle market, as that area does not have an ABC affiliate of its own. It is carried in the local tier of Charter Spectrum&#x27;s cable system in Presque Isle, and is also offered as the ABC affiliate in the Presque Isle Dish Network and DirecTV channel lineups.

==History==
The station signed on October 15, 1965, as WEMT under the ownership of Downeast Television, an ownership group that included Melvin Stone, owner of WGUY (1250 AM, later WNSW on 1200 AM; now defunct) and Rumford&#x27;s WRUM, and Herbert Hoffman, owner of WBOS-AM-FM in Boston. Until WEMT went on the air, ABC maintained secondary affiliations with CBS affiliate WABI-TV (channel 5) and NBC affiliate WLBZ-TV (channel 2). It is the only television station in Bangor to have never switched its network affiliation. Downeast sold WEMT to Eastern Maine Broadcasting Systems (a subsidiary of Valley Communications, owner of WPNO in Auburn and WSKW and WTOS-FM in Skowhegan) on February 2, 1976. The new owners changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WVII-TV that September. Although ABC was the nation&#x27;s number one network by that time, Eastern Maine Broadcasting Systems suffered from massive financial problems during its ownership of WVII, bouncing paychecks, relying on an outdated Super 8mm film camera to film stories and lacking basic amenities such as air conditioning; the station went unnoticed in Bangor during this time. WVII did see some success as a border blaster when viewers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, discovered the station&#x27;s late-night offering, &quot;Dick Stacey&#x27;s Country Jamboree&quot;. Eastern Maine Broadcasting Systems sold the station to Seaway Communications, a minority-controlled company that already owned WAEO-TV (now WJFW-TV) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, on July 23, 1982.

WVII suffered a transmitter failure on February 9, 1995, due to a fire, knocking the station off the air in the middle of the 6 p.m. news, during a Bangor Hydro Electric advertisement. The following day, TCI Cable, whose facilities shared a real property line with WVII on Target Industrial Circle, ran a transmission line from its building to the WVII studios, allowing the station to resume normal operations for Bangor cable viewers; however, until a temporary transmitter was activated on February 19, cable systems in areas outside of Bangor were forced to carry distant affiliates for programming (WVII was supplemented by WMTW in the Augusta and Waterville areas (which are considered to be part of the Portland area), while Miami affiliate WPLG was carried in the Presque Isle market in place of WVII) and over-the-air viewers outside of the Bangor market&#x27;s extreme western fringes lost ABC programming completely during that time. WVII would not return to full-power broadcasting until April 1995; at that time, it became the second station in Bangor to broadcast in stereo. The cause of the fire was determined by the station&#x27;s chief engineer to have been a snake crawling into the final on the transmitter causing an electrical short.

Seaway Broadcasting merged with current owner Rockfleet Broadcasting in 1998. Under Rockfleet, WVII ventured into low-power broadcasting in Bangor; it signed a local marketing agreement with James McLeod, owner of W30BF (the former Bangor transmitter for Maine Public Television Plus) and WBGR-LP (channel 33), in 2000, and relaunched channel 30 as UPN affiliate WCKD-LP, which also carried some Fox Sports programming (in the 1990s, WVII itself carried some sports programming from Fox on a secondary basis), in 2001. WCKD tried to become a full Fox affiliate that October after Portland&#x27;s WPXT announced that it would switch to The WB, but was blocked from doing so by UPN; this did not stop the station from continuing its existing relationship with Fox Sports. As a result, from October 2001 to April 2003, Fox&#x27;s prime time and children&#x27;s programming in the Bangor and Portland areas was carried by Foxnet, which served as the network&#x27;s affiliate for the entire state of Maine during that time. After Rockfleet Broadcasting acquired W22BU (channel 22) from MS Communications in 2003, it changed that station&#x27;s call letters to WFVX-LP and, on April 13, affiliated it with Fox. Rockfleet moved all of WCKD&#x27;s syndicated and local programming, but not the UPN affiliation, to WFVX. That August, Rockfleet and James McLeod agreed to end the LMA with WCKD.

WVII made national news in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article on October 30, 2006, quoting General Manager Michael Palmer saying &quot;when Bar Harbor is underwater, then we can do global warming stories. Until then,&quot; he added, &quot;no more.&quot; According to Palmer, this policy, implemented the preceding summer, was introduced because: &quot;a) we do local news, b) the issue evolved from hard science into hard politics and c) despite what you may have heard from the mainstream media, this science is far from conclusive.&quot; In an e-mail message to the station&#x27;s operations manager, a news anchor, and a news reporter, Palmer placed &quot;global warming stories in the same category as &#x27;the killer African bee scare&#x27; from the 1970s or, more recently, the Y2K scare when everyone&#x27;s computer was going to self-destruct.&quot; Palmer eventually told the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; that the e-mail was in response to an &quot;overtly political&quot; report from a former reporter and that the station did not intend to stop reporting on global warming altogether; on the following night&#x27;s newscast, WVII broadcast a report in which residents were asked if they felt global temperatures were rising &quot;so we could immediately dispel the rumor.&quot;

In August 2008, WVII and WFVX began to split live coverage of New England Patriots pre-season games. Channel 7 had previously shown the games in 1995 and since 2001; however, National Football League rules required WVII to show them on tape delay, despite several efforts by the station to carry live telecasts.

WVII has been digital-only since February 17, 2009, the original date when all television stations in the United States transitioned from analog broadcasts to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (the date would later change to June 12, 2009). Initially, the digital signal remained on UHF channel 14 (where it broadcast before the transition), but it subsequently returned to its former analog channel, 7.

The station received national attention when the station&#x27;s main anchor team, Cindy Michaels (who also acted as WVII/WFVX&#x27;s news director) and Tony Consiglio (who also doubled as executive producer), resigned their positions on-air at the end of the 6 p.m. newscast on November 20, 2012; effective immediately. Michaels and Consiglio later told the &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; and other media outlets that they felt compelled to resign due to conflicts with upper management of both the station and Rockfleet. They claimed that management interfered with the news department so much that in the end, it was impossible to present balanced newscasts. They took the step of resigning on-air because they wanted a chance to say goodbye to their viewers. They were replaced by former WABI-TV and WQCB radio news anchor Craig Colson, who also became news director for WVII and WFVX, in December 2012.

In June 2013, WVII and WFVX reached a deal to carry Husson University sports. This was followed a month later with a deal to carry University of Maine sports; as a result, WVII and WFVX replaced WABI-TV as the television flagship of the Black Bear Sports Network. As part of the deal, Black Bear sports telecasts are also seen on Stadium College Sports, and production is handled by Pack Network (WABI had produced its telecasts in-house).

In early September 2017, WVII replaced their long-time version of the commonly-used Circle 7 logo from ABC (used among their channel 7 stations) with a different logo variation made up of a block number &quot;7&quot;.

On February 28, 2022, WVII and WFVX temporarily changed their logos to blue and yellow, the colors of the Ukrainian flag, in support of Ukraine after the 2022 Russian invasion.

In July 2023, a WVII employee was indicted on felony theft charges. According to District Attorney Chris Almy, Melissa Moran, the former accounts manager for WVII/WFVX, stole more than $200,000 from the station over a period of two years. 

WVII is one of a few ABC affiliates to air paid programming on weekdays.

==News operation==
WVII has spent most of its history as a distant third place in the Nielsen ratings behind WABI and WLBZ, at point in its early existence not registering any measurable or identifiable audience in one of the smallest media markets in the U.S. Since the early 2010s, it is quickly catching up with WLBZ in the Eastern Maine market. Its news operation is quite small compared to its rivals. The station produces newscasts at 6 a.m. (on WVII), 7 a.m. (on WFVX), noon, 6 p.m., 6:30 and 10 p.m. (on WFVX), and 11 p.m. WVII&#x27;s website offers on-demand video of its newscasts.

Unlike most ABC affiliates, WVII does not air weeknight newscasts at 5 and/or 5:30, though it did produce a 5:30 newscast until August 1998. It currently does not air weekend newscasts; the 6 p.m. edition ended in September 1998, and the 11 p.m. show was dropped in July 2003. However, WFVX began airing a weekend 10 p.m. newscast in September 2012. The station also ended its 6:30 a.m. newscast on October 1, 1998, though it returned on September 7, 2011. WVII also attempted a noon newscast during the 1990s. On February 4, 2016, WVII brought back a Noon newscast.

WVII operated its own weather department during the 20th century, serving as an entry-level opening for aspiring television meteorologists. On October 1, 2002, the station contracted out its forecasts to AccuWeather. The segments are recorded in advance with rotating meteorologists and fed via satellite to Bangor from AccuWeather&#x27;s headquarters in State College, Pennsylvania (which WVII occasionally refers to as the &quot;ABC 7 Weather Center&quot;). Weekend forecasts started being produced by co-owned WJFW in Wisconsin in 2018, followed by weekday newscasts on January 1, 2020.

WVII began taping the 10 and 11 p.m. newscasts earlier in the evening on October 16, 2006, though the sports report was still seen live on Fridays so that game highlights and scores from high school football games could still be featured. As of September 2011, WFVX has resumed airing a live newscast at 10.

When providing regional and state coverage, WVII and CBS affiliate WGME-TV in Portland share content and video footage. During the summer months, the station periodically airs its early evening news at 6 on Fridays from a town selected in advance. These newscasts are known as &quot;ABC 7 News on the Road&quot;, and include features about the town where the show is being broadcast from.

In December 2012, WVII and WFVX converted to high definition. A new website, studio and HD graphics were also added during this transition.

<doc id="1189516" wikidata="Q171553" url="?curid=1189516" title="Mark Blundell">
<text>Mark Blundell (born 8 April 1966) is a British racing driver who competed in Formula One for four seasons, sports cars, and CART. He won the 1992 24 Hours of Le Mans. He was a Formula One presenter for the British broadcaster ITV until the end of the 2008 season when the TV broadcasting rights switched to the BBC. Blundell returned to the track in 2019, driving in the Kwik Fit British Touring Car Championship for the Trade Price Cars team. Blundell has returned to the series in a new role for 2020 helping to form the latest name to line the grid - MB Motorsport as Sporting Director working with Laser Tools Racing. He is CEO of Europe wide sports management group, MB Partners.

==Background==
Blundell was born in Barnet, London. He first dabbled in motor sport at the age of 14, racing motocross bikes across England. At the age of 17 he made the switch to four wheels, starting his driving career in Formula Ford. In his first season he placed second in both British Junior Formula Ford Championships. The following year, Blundell won both the Esso British and Snetterton Formula Ford 1600 crowns. The next year, he began racing in the more powerful Formula Ford 2000 category, and won the BBC Grandstand series. He returned to FF1600 to compete in the European Championship racing, taking pole, and finishing fourth overall. In 1986, he won another championship in Formula Ford 2000, this time the European title.

In 1987, Blundell moved on to racing in Formula 3000 and started a number of Formula Three races for TOM&#x27;S-Toyota. 1988 brought a switch to the works Lola team in F3000. Blundell completed the season in sixth place.

==Formula One==
Blundell signed with the sports car team at Nissan for 1989, landing a factory seat. He also managed a test drive with Williams F1 Team. By 1990, Blundell left F3000 to concentrate on sports cars. That same year, he earned pole position at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race driving a Nissan R90CK. Blundell became the youngest driver to achieve pole position at the Le Mans 24 Hours, with a 6.040-second margin ahead of second place.

1991 marked Blundell&#x27;s transition into Formula One. His debut season saw a sixth place in Belgium with the Brabham Yamaha team while also maintaining his testing deal with Williams. However, the following season, he was not retained by Brabham, and was left without a race seat in Formula One. He declined Williams&#x27; offer to stay on as their test driver for 1992, as he had his eyes solely on a full-time race seat. He told his contemporary Damon Hill about the vacant Williams test seat, which Hill eventually took. Having failed to land a drive for 1992, Blundell eventually signed a testing deal with McLaren. Whilst being a full-time tester for McLaren, he also continued to race sports cars. That year, with the factory Peugeot outfit, he won the Le Mans 24 Hours, adding to his earlier pole.

Blundell returned to Formula One in 1993. A drive with Ligier netted him his first two podium finishes in South Africa and Germany, and tenth in the final World Championship standings. It was a one-year deal with Ligier, however, and in 1994 Blundell signed with Tyrrell. Blundell managed only one podium finish in the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix, which was the last Formula One podium finish for Tyrrell. At the end of the season, owing to lack of sponsorship, Tyrrell released Blundell as the retirement of Nigel Mansell meant a return to McLaren, this time, in a race seat. Teamed with future two-time world champion Mika Häkkinen, Blundell recorded five points finishes and once again took tenth in the final standings. 1995 also saw continued success in sports cars with a fourth place showing in Le Mans, but was Blundell&#x27;s final year in Formula One, owing to the signing of David Coulthard by McLaren.

Blundell achieved 3 podiums, and scored a total of 32 championship points.

Blundell came close to making a return to Formula One in 2001. He had advanced negotiations with Prost Grand Prix to be the team&#x27;s test and development driver but the deal was not concluded.

==CART==
Out of Formula One, Blundell moved to the United States and joined the CART racing team PacWest, alongside fellow former Formula One driver Maurício Gugelmin. Early in the season, Blundell crashed head-on into a concrete wall in Rio, resulting in a broken foot and ankle and forcing him to miss three races. Despite this, he was third in the rookie standings with three top six finishes in the U.S. 500, Detroit Grand Prix, and Michigan International Speedway races.

In 1997 Blundell came within one corner of winning the Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix before running out of fuel, an event he described at the time as the worst disappointment of his career. In the next race, he passed Gil de Ferran on the final straight to win the Grand Prix of Portland by 0.027 seconds. Blundell recorded further race victories in Toronto and Fontana en route to sixth in the championship. That year he was also named British Driver of the Year by &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine.

A crash whilst testing at Gateway in early 1999 left Blundell to miss 8 races in the middle of the 1999 season. He returned to PacWest for a final season in 2000. However, after finishing 21st in the championship with 18 points, he left PacWest racing by mutual agreement.

==From driving to commentating==

Blundell again crossed the Atlantic to focus on his sports car racing. He failed to finish Le Mans with the MG Lola team, though he and his teammates impressed. Off-track, Blundell joined ITV television in Britain as an analyst for the 2002 Formula One season. This position lasted until the end of the 2008 Formula One season when ITV lost coverage to the BBC.

Since 2001, Blundell&#x27;s racing involvement has steadily declined, with only the occasional event. He did test a Dale Coyne Champ Car to help prepare Darren Manning for a one-off in the first CART race in Britain at Rockingham, and raced in the British round of the World Rally Championship. In 2003, along with Johnny Herbert and David Brabham, he finished second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, completing a 1–2 sweep by Bentley. In 2003 he finished third at the 12 Hours of Sebring driving for Bentley alongside Johnny Herbert and David Brabham.

From 2004, Blundell ran a management company, 2MB Sports Management, with fellow ex-F1 driver and friend Martin Brundle, until Brundle decided to devote more time to his television career. The company represent drivers including McLaren test driver Gary Paffett, British Formula 3 champion and IndyCar driver Mike Conway, Ferrari junior Callum Ilott, BMW backed racer Tom Blomqvist, IndyCar driver Jordan King, British F4 champion Kiern Jewiss and British GT driver Patrick Kibble.

==Helmet==
Blundell&#x27;s helmet is yellow with three red stripes and two yellow gaps in the middle, a blue stripe in the entire chin area and a blue circle on the top with his golden initials on it. The rear of his helmet bears the motto &quot;The Will To Win&quot; – a quote from his grandfather.

<text>James Jeremiah Wadsworth (June 12, 1905 – March 13, 1984) was an American politician and diplomat from New York.

==Early life==
A member of the prominent Genesee Valley Wadsworths, James J. Wadsworth was born in Groveland, New York on June 12, 1905. He was a direct descendant of pioneer William Wadsworth, a founder of Hartford, Connecticut.

His great-grandfather, James S. Wadsworth, was a Union general in the American Civil War, killed in the Battle of the Wilderness of 1864. Both his grandfather, James Wolcott Wadsworth, and his father, James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr., represented New York in Congress. His other grandfather was United States Secretary of State John Hay. His sister Evelyn was married to William Stuart Symington; they were the parents of James Wadsworth Symington, his nephew.

Wadsworth graduated from Fay School in 1918, from St. Mark&#x27;s School, and from Yale University in 1927, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.

==Career==
Wadsworth was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939–40 and 1941. He resigned his seat in 1941.

Wadsworth was medically unfit for World War II because of an injured leg, but aided the war effort as an assistant manager at the Curtiss-Wright Corporation plant in Buffalo, New York. In 1950, he became deputy administrator of the civil defense office for the National Security Resources Board, which drafted many of the civil defense plans that were prepared at the height of the Cold War.

From 1953 to 1960, Wadsworth was Deputy Chief of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations. He was appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations by President Eisenhower, and he served from 1960 to 1961.

In 1965, President Johnson appointed Wadsworth to the Federal Communications Commission, and he served until 1970. Wadsworth left the FCC to join the American team negotiating a charter for the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat).

==Personal life==
In 1927, Wadsworth was married to Harty Griggs Tilton (1906–1965), a daughter of Benjamin Trowbridge Tilton and Anna Billings (née Griggs) Tilton. Together, they were the parents of:

* Alice Wadsworth (1928–1998), who married Trowbridge Strong (1925–2001) in 1948.

He died in Rochester, New York on March 13, 1984. He was buried at Temple Hill Cemetery in Geneseo.

He was talked about as a candidate for Governor of New York, but did not run. In 1906, he was defeated for re-election by Peter A. Porter.

* James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr. (1877–1952), who became a U.S. Senator and married Alice Evelyn Hay, daughter of Secretary of State John Hay.
* Harriet Travers Wadsworth (1881–1975), who married Fletcher Harper, a polo player and fox hunter who was the grandson of Fletcher Harper, in 1913.

<text>James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. (August 12, 1877June 21, 1952) was an American politician, a Republican from New York. He was the son of New York State Comptroller James Wolcott Wadsworth, and the grandson of Union General James S. Wadsworth.

==Early life==
Wadsworth was born in Geneseo, New York on August 12, 1877. He was the son of New York State Comptroller James Wolcott Wadsworth (1846–1926) and Louisa (née Travers) Wadsworth (1848–1931).

His paternal grandparents were Union General James S. Wadsworth and Mary Craig (née Wharton) Wadsworth (1814–1874). His grandfather built a 13,000 square-foot house in Geneseo in 1835.

Wadsworth attended St. Mark&#x27;s School, then graduated from Yale in New Haven, Connecticut in 1898, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.

==Career==
After Yale, he served as a private in the Volunteer Army in the Puerto Rican Campaign during the Spanish–American War. Upon leaving the Army, he entered the livestock and farming business, first in New York and then Texas.

He became active early in Republican politics. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1910; and was Speaker from 1906 to 1910.

In 1912, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the Republican ticket with Job. E. Hedges, but was defeated. In 1914, at the first popular election for the U.S. Senate (until 1911, the U.S. senators had been elected by the New York State Legislature), Wadsworth defeated Democrat James W. Gerard (the incumbent United States Ambassador to Germany) and Progressive Bainbridge Colby. Wadsworth was the Senate Minority Whip in 1915 because the Democrats held the majority of Senate seats. He was re-elected in 1920 but defeated by Democrat Robert F. Wagner in 1926. In 1921, Wadsworth was considered for the post of Secretary of War by President Warren G. Harding but was ultimately passed over in favor of John W. Weeks.

Wadsworth was a proponent of individual rights and feared what he considered the threat of federal intervention into the private lives of Americans. He believed that the only purpose of the United States Constitution is to limit the powers of government and to protect the rights of citizens. For this reason, he voted against the Eighteenth Amendment when it was before the Senate. Before Prohibition went into effect, Wadsworth predicted that there would be widespread violations and contempt for the law.

By the mid-1920s, Wadsworth was one of a handful of congressmen who spoke out forcefully and frequently against prohibition. He was especially concerned that citizens could be prosecuted by both state and federal officials for a single violation of prohibition law. This seemed to him to constitute double jeopardy, inconsistent with the spirit if not the letter of the Fifth Amendment.

In 1926, he joined the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment and made 131 speeches across the country for the organization between then and repeal. His political acumen and contacts proved valuable in overturning prohibition.

He served in the U.S. House from 1933 to 1951, and, like Alton Lennon, Garrett Withers, Claude Pepper, Hugh Mitchell, Matthew M. Neely, and Magnus Johnson, is one of the few modern Senators to serve later in the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, he opposed the isolationism of many of his conservative Republican colleagues, opposed anti-lynching legislation on state&#x27;s rights grounds, rejected minimum wage laws and most of FDR&#x27;s domestic policy. Although Wadsworth never ran for president, his name was mentioned as a possible candidate in 1936 and 1944.

Winifred Stanley, a representative from Buffalo NY, was kept off the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary by Wadsworth Jr. who was in charge of assignments. Stanley made clear that she wanted to maintain in &quot;peacetime the drive and energy which women have contributed to the war.&quot; Thus in 1944, Stanley had introduced a bill for the National Labor Relations Board to bar discrimination in pay on the basis of sex. The bill died in committee. Wadsworth&#x27;s reason was his opposition to women in the workplace, according to a House of Representatives history of women in Congress.

A confidential 1943 analysis of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office described Wadsworth as

He was a hereditary companion of Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was also a member of the United Spanish War Veterans.

==Personal life==
Wadsworth was married to Alice Evelyn Hay (1880–1960). She was the daughter of former United States Secretary of State John Hay under President Theodore Roosevelt. Through her sister Helen Hay Whitney, she was the aunt of John Hay Whitney, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Alice, who opposed women&#x27;s suffrage, served as president of the National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage, which Wadsworth also opposed. Together, they were the parents of:

* Evelyn Wadsworth (1903–1972), who married Stuart Symington (1901–1988) in 1924. Symington was the first Secretary of the Air Force and a Democratic U.S. Senator from Missouri, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960.
* James Jeremiah Wadsworth (1905–1984), who served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
* Reverdy J. Wadsworth (1914–1970), who married Eleanor Katherine Roosevelt (1915–1995), the daughter of Henry Latrobe Roosevelt, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

Wadsworth died on June 21, 1952, in Washington, D.C. He was buried in Temple Hill Cemetery in Geneseo.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Evelyn, he was the grandfather of James Wadsworth Symington (b. 1927), who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Missouri as a Democrat, from 1969 to 1977.

Through his son James, he was the grandfather of Alice Wadsworth (1928–1998) who was married to Trowbridge Strong (1925–2001) in 1948 at the home of Wadsworth&#x27;s grandfather, General James Wadsworth.

<text>Jeremiah Wadsworth (July 12, 1743 – April 30, 1804) was an American sea captain, merchant, and statesman from Hartford, Connecticut who profited from his position as a government official charged with supplying the Continental Army. He represented Connecticut in both the Continental Congress and the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life==
He was a son of Daniel Wadsworth and Abigail ( Talcott) Wadsworth. He was a descendant of William Wadsworth, one of the founders of Hartford and a pastor of the town&#x27;s Center Congregational Church. He went to sea in 1761 at the age of 18 for health reasons, starting as a regular sailor on one of his uncle&#x27;s ships.

==Career==
Wadsworth eventually rose to become first mate of a vessel and eventually a captain who made his fortune in the West India trade.

===During the American Revolution===

When the war started, Wadsworth was appointed to a committee charged with buying 5,000 pairs of yarn stockings for the army (which had already been sent to Canada). He served on another committee to procure 1,800 pounds of &quot;lawful money in specie&quot; in exchange for bills for use by the army. The Connecticut General Assembly later commissioned him and Col. Jonathan Fitch to find a large number of tin kettles for the army. The next assignment was to buy up as much pork as he could (both to furnish the American army and to keep it out of the hands and stomachs of the British forces).

Having served effectively in these assignments in Connecticut, Congress elected him Deputy Commissary General of Purchases on June 17, 1777, but he resigned in August. When Congress reorganized the supply system, he became Commissary General in April 1778, resigning in December 1779.

Reaching the rank of colonel, he became commissary for Comte de Rochambeau&#x27;s army until the war&#x27;s end. In the summer of 1783, he went to Paris to report to the French on his activities. He is said to have turned a good profit for himself in his transactions for supplies.

Wadsworth was a good friend of Nathanael Greene and during the time Greene was Quarter-master General they formed some investment partnerships.

Like many of Connecticut&#x27;s elite at the time, Wadsworth owned slaves. He bought an entire family, including Peleg Nott, who went on to become a Black Governor of Connecticut, presiding over the state&#x27;s Black community. Wadsworth freed Nott circa 1780. For a time, Wadsworth owned a 6,600-acre plantation in South Carolina, along with the 129 slaves who farmed it.

===After the Revolution===
Wadsworth became a &quot;pioneer in banking, insurance, and the breeding of cattle&quot; after the war, according to historian North Callahan. He served as the second President of the Bank of New York from 1785 to 1786.

He was a member of the Continental Congress in 1788 and a member of the Connecticut convention which ratified the U.S. Constitution in 1788. From 1789 to 1795 he served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Wadsworth initially lost reelection in 1790 but was specially reelected when his initial successor Pierpont Edwards declined to take his seat. He was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1795 and of the state Executive Council from 1795 to 1801, and simultaneously served as a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors.

He was appointed Treaty Commissioner, by George Washington, at the Treaty of Big Tree between the U.S. and the Seneca nation in 1797.

==Personal life==
In 1767, Wadsworth married Mehithabel Russell, a daughter of William H. Russell and Mary ( Pierpont) Russell. His domestic arrangements were described by Lydia Sigourney in her memoirs. He built two mansions near his own house, one for his daughter Catharine, who had married Nathaniel Terry, and one for his son, Daniel Wadsworth.

He died in Hartford, Connecticut, April 30, 1804, and is interred in the Ancient Burying Ground.

<text>Peleg Wadsworth (May 6, 1748 – November 12, 1829) was an American Patriot officer during the American Revolutionary War and a Congressman from Massachusetts representing the District of Maine. He was also grandfather of noted American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

==Early life==

Wadsworth was born in Duxbury in the Province of Massachusetts Bay (now Duxbury, Massachusetts) to Peleg and Susanna (Sampson) Wadsworth. He graduated from Harvard College with an A.B. (1769) and an A.M. (1772), and taught school for several years in Plymouth, Massachusetts, with his former classmate Alexander Scammel. There he met Elizabeth Bartlett (1753 – 1825), whom he married in 1772.

==American Revolutionary War==
The Wadsworths lived in Kingston, until 1775, when Wadsworth recruited a company of minutemen, of which he was chosen captain. His company mustered in response to the alarms generated by the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. He was fifth in descendant to Christopher Wadsworth, who came from England to the Americas in 1632. The Plymouth County battalion, commanded by Col. Theophilus Cotton marched to Marshfield to attack a garrison of British troops there. The attack was delayed for two days, allowing the British time to escape Marshfield by sea. During that time, Capt. Wadsworth, frustrated with the delay, advanced his company to within firing range of the British encampment, nearly instigating combat.

Wadsworth served as aide to Gen. Artemas Ward in March 1776, and as an engineer under Gen. John Thomas in 1776, assisting in laying out the defenses of Roxbury, Massachusetts. He was present at the Battle of Long Island on August 1, 1776. He was made brigadier general of militia in 1777 and Adjutant General of Massachusetts in 1778.

Wadsworth&#x27;s finest military engagement was in one of the worst American military defeats of the war. In the summer of 1779 he served as second in command to General Solomon Lovell over the land forces sent to make a combined arms attack on Fort George at Castine, in the so-called Penobscot Expedition. Commodore Dudley Saltonstall was in command of the naval forces. Lt. Colonel Paul Revere also served in this expedition as commander of artillery. While General Lovell remained aboard the Commodore&#x27;s vessel, Wadsworth and Revere landed with the infantry and artillery and laid siege to the fort for about two weeks. Due to the reluctance of the Commodore to launch a naval attack in support of the ground forces, the British garrison held out until ships of the Royal Navy arrived from New York City and drove the American Navy up the Penobscot River where all 43 American warships were sunk or were scuttled and burned, comprising most of the American fleet, making it the worst American naval disaster prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Wadsworth, still with the forces on shore, organized and led a successful overland retreat through the Maine frontier. Colonel Revere and Commodore Saltonstall were court-martialed for their roles in the debacle (Revere was acquitted, Saltonstall was &quot;dismissed the service&quot;).

In March 1780, Wadsworth was given command of all the troops raised for the defense of the Province of Maine. On February 17, 1781, a party of 25 Loyalists overran his headquarters in Thomaston; this was in revenge for Wadsworth ordering the court-martial and execution of a guide who had assisted Loyalists traveling from Falmouth (now Portland) to Fort George. Wadsworth was captured and imprisoned in Fort George at Bagaduce (Castine) (the same fort he had led the attack against in the summer of 1779), but he and fellow prisoner Maj. Benjamin Burton eventually escaped on June 15, 1781 by cutting a hole in the ceiling of their jail and crawling out along the joists. Wadsworth then returned to his family in Plymouth, where he remained until the war&#x27;s end.

==After war years==
In April 1784 Wadsworth returned to Maine, purchased 1.5 acres (6,000 m2) of land on Back Street (now Congress Street in Portland), engaged in surveying, and opened a store in early 1785. There he also built a house, now the historic Wadsworth-Longfellow House. He headed the committee that organized the first convention to discuss independence for Maine from Massachusetts, held in January 1786. He and his wife had eleven children: Alexander Scammell (9 May 1774 – 28 August 1775); Charles Lee (26 January 1776 – 29 September 1848); Zilpah (6 January 1778 – 12 March 1851); Elizabeth (21 September 1779 – 1 August 1802); John (1 September 1781 – 22 January 1860); Lucia (12 June 1783 – 17 October 1864); Henry (21 June 1785 – 4 September 1804); George (6 January 1788 – 8 April 1816); Alexander Scammell (7 May 1790 – 5 April 1851); Samuel Bartlett (1 September 1791 – 2 October 1874); and Peleg (10 October 1793 – 17 January 1875). Zilpah became the mother of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Although Wadsworth continued to live in Portland, in 1790 he purchased 7,800 acres (30 km2) from the Commonwealth in what became the town of Hiram, settled his son Charles there in 1795, and also in 1795 began building Wadsworth Hall for his retirement.

In 1792 Wadsworth was chosen a presidential elector and a member of the Massachusetts Senate, and from 1793 to 1807 was the first representative in Congress from the region of Massachusetts that later became Maine. In January 1807 he moved to Hiram where he incorporated the township (February 27, 1807) and served as selectman, treasurer and magistrate. For the remainder of his life he devoted himself to farming and local concerns. He died in Hiram on November 12, 1829, and is buried in the family cemetery at Wadsworth Hall.

==Legacy==
Wadsworth&#x27;s Portland house was declared a National Historic Landmark for its association with him and with his grandson, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The house at Portland was gifted to the Maine Historical Society by his granddaughter Anne Longfellow Pierce upon her death in 1901. She was the last family member to live in the home. Wadsworth Hall, Peleg Wadsworth&#x27;s home in Hiram, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Johan Wagenaar (1 November 1862 – 17 June 1941) was a Dutch composer and organist.

==Life==
Born in Utrecht, out of wedlock, he was the son of Cypriaan Gerard Berger van Hengst and Johanna Wagenaar. Wagenaar&#x27;s parents were of different social strata: his father was an aristocrat, while his mother was of more humble origins. For this reason, Wagenaar&#x27;s parents were not married, and thus Wagenaar received his mother&#x27;s name as his family name. While Wagenaar resented that his parents never got married, he was by no means neglected by his father.

Wagenaar evidenced a talent for music as a child. However, he did not begin to receive a formal education in music until age 13, with subsequent instruction in piano, organ, violin, theory, and composition. He was under the tutelage of the composer Richard Hol and the organist Samuel de Lange, Jr. In 1892, he studied with Brahms&#x27; friend Heinrich von Herzogenberg in Berlin, specifically taking lessons in counterpoint.

In 1888, he succeeded Richard Hol as organist of Utrecht Cathedral, and earned fame for his skills at organ performances. In Utrecht, Wagenaar became a teacher at the music school in 1896, and the school&#x27;s director in 1904. He also received an appointment with the Utrecht Municipal Orchestra (Utrechtsch Stedelijk Orkest). Between 1919 and 1937, Wagenaar was director of the Royal Conservatory at the Hague. His pupils included Peter van Anrooy, Emile Enthoven, Henri van Goudoever, Alexander Voormolen, Leon Orthel, Clara Wildschut, Allard de Ridder, Willem Pijper, Hendrika Tussenbroek, and Bernard Wagenaar. 

On 23 July 1897, Wagenaar married Dina Petronella van Valkenburg. They had two daughters. He died in Den Haag.

==Works==
Wagenaar&#x27;s compositions include operas, cantatas, organ music, and orchestral works. The music of Hector Berlioz had a modest influence on his works, but a much more pronounced influence was Richard Strauss.

In his later years, Wagenaar received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Utrecht University.

<doc id="1189550" wikidata="Q7226186" url="?curid=1189550" title="Polycarpos Giorkatzis">
<text>Polykarpos Giorkatzis ( (); 5 July 1932 – 15 March 1970) was a Greek Cypriot politician. He served as the first Minister of the Interior of the Republic of Cyprus. He also served as provisional minister of Labour in the period leading to Cyprus being proclaimed an independent state. Before entering the political stage he fought for EOKA. His political career evolved from a staunch supporter of Makarios to becoming one of the archbishop&#x27;s principal political rivals. He was assassinated in 1970.

==EOKA years==
Giorkatzis joined the ranks of EOKA, the Greek Cypriot organization fighting against British rule in Cyprus, in his twenties and assumed the nom de guerre &quot;Laertes&quot;. He became regional commander of EOKA operations in Nicosia. He was nicknamed &quot;Houdini&quot; in reference to his several successful escapes including from the Nicosia hospital on 31 August 1956 and from Nicosia Central Prisons on 2 May 1958. After the end of the struggle he claimed to have been tortured whilst held captive by the colonial security forces.

==Political career==
===Provisional Minister of Labour===
Giorkatzis was appointed Minister of Labour in the transitional government set up immediately before the Republic of Cyprus became independent. The Ministry of Labour, however, was effectively run by Tassos Papadopoulos, who held the official title of Minister of the Interior. British pressure had forced Makarios to distance Giorkatzis, a former active EOKA member from the Ministry of Interior which was in charge of internal security, police and intelligence.

===Minister of the Interior===

Following the first elections in 1960, Archbishop Makarios III, officially swapped the ministries between the two men. Typically for the ex-EOKA ministers in Makarios&#x27; first Council of Ministers, Giorkatzis was very young at the time, aged 29. He also had no higher education.

As Minister of the Interior, Giorkatzis quickly became notorious for using the police as his personal army. It is rumoured that he also set up a vast information network. He was also the leader of the underground Greek Cypriot pro-Enosis movement, initially known simply as the Organisation, which later clashed with the Turkish Cypriot TMT in the intercommunal strife which began in December 1963. Giorkatzis&#x27; code name in the Organisation was &quot;Akritas&quot;, another name for the legendary Byzantine hero Digenis, an obvious link to the pseudonym of EOKA leader Georgios Grivas. Giorkatzis is alleged to have authored the so-called Akritas plan (plan of action in case of clashes between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus). The document became famous after it was leaked to the press, and acquired its popular name from the codename signed under it. With Glafkos Clerides he established the first centre right party of Cyprus, attracting many of the EOKA members in its ranks.

===Links to failed Greek PM assassination===

In 1968, Giorkatzis offered assistance to Alekos Panagoulis, a Greek political activist (and later politician), who opposed the rise of the military junta in Greece, in his attempted assassination of dictator Georgios Papadopoulos on 13 August 1968. Panagoulis was arrested shortly after the failure of the attempt. It is not likely Giorkatzis was acting out of ideology. It is much more probable that he attempted to use Panagoulis as part of some greater plan, since there were growing signs of disagreement between the government of Cyprus under President and Archbishop Makarios and the military junta in Greece. What is known is that Giorkatzis simultaneously attempted to ship explosives and weapons to Greece using diplomatic bag prerogatives.

Despite the torture he was subjected to, Panagoulis revealed nothing. However, the Giorkatzis connection became known to the junta and Archbishop Makarios, President of the Republic of Cyprus, was forced by the junta to ask for Giorkatzis&#x27; resignation. The dictator Georgios Papadopoulos, the target of the attempt, had been godfather at the baptism of Giorkatzis&#x27; first child, Constantinos, just a year earlier, which particularly incensed Papadopoulos.

==Assassination==

A week later, Giorkatzis drove to a secret night rendezvous in an open area outside the village of Mia Milia. He asked a close associate to accompany him, but dropped him off some distance from the meeting point and drove on alone. As Giorkatzis&#x27; car approached another car parked at the meeting point, the occupants of the other car opened fire with automatic weapons. One of them then walked up to Giorkatzis&#x27; car and delivered a coup de grâce. They then drove off leaving Giorkatzis dead at the scene. Fanis Demetriou, the police officer in charge of the investigation, quickly found evidence pointing towards the same two Greek officers in Makarios&#x27; entourage who had been found to be involved in the Hermes plot. After he reported this to his superiors, Demetriou was ordered off the case. The two particular Greek officers were eventually only questioned several weeks later, at which time they gave identical accounts of their whereabouts on the night of the murder. They both left the island shortly thereafter and never returned.

Giorkatzis&#x27; widow Fotini married Tassos Papadopoulos, then Minister of Labour, two years after her husband&#x27;s death. Papadopoulos and Giorkatzis had been close friends, and Papadopoulos had been best man at Giorkatzis&#x27; wedding.

Though Giorkatzis planned and executed an operation to assassinate the President of the Republic, and though his role in this has been acknowledged by the courts, the yearly church service in his memory is attended by prominent figures among the Greek Cypriot political leadership and at least one street has been named after him. A museum honoring the most distinguished aspects of his life is active in his birthplace in Palaichori, formally opened in 2002 by the then President Glafkos Clerides.

==Quotes==
* &quot;Anything can happen now. To Makarios, people are like lemons: when they are squeezed dry, he throws them away.&quot; Quoted soon after the failed assassination attempt on Makarios on 8 March 1970. Giorkatzis was removed from a plane whilst trying to flee to Beirut.

<text>In mathematics, a path in a topological space formula_1 is a continuous function from a closed interval into formula_2 

Paths play an important role in the fields of topology and mathematical analysis. 
For example, a topological space for which there exists a path connecting any two points is said to be path-connected. Any space may be broken up into path-connected components. The set of path-connected components of a space formula_1 is often denoted formula_4 

One can also define paths and loops in pointed spaces, which are important in homotopy theory. If formula_1 is a topological space with basepoint formula_6 then a path in formula_1 is one whose initial point is formula_8. Likewise, a loop in formula_1 is one that is based at formula_8.

== Definition ==

A &quot;curve&quot; in a topological space formula_1 is a continuous function formula_12 from a non-empty and non-degenerate interval formula_13 
A &#x27; in formula_1 is a curve formula_15 whose domain formula_16 is a compact non-degenerate interval (meaning formula_17 are real numbers), where formula_18 is called the &#x27; of the path and formula_19 is called its . 
A is a path whose initial point is formula_20 and whose terminal point is formula_21 
Every non-degenerate compact interval formula_16 is homeomorphic to formula_23 which is why a is sometimes, especially in homotopy theory, defined to be a continuous function formula_24 from the closed unit interval formula_25 into formula_2
An or 0 in formula_1 is a path in formula_1 that is also a topological embedding. 

Importantly, a path is not just a subset of formula_1 that &quot;looks like&quot; a curve, it also includes a parameterization. For example, the maps formula_30 and formula_31 represent two different paths from 0 to 1 on the real line. 

A loop in a space formula_1 based at formula_33 is a path from formula_20 to formula_35 A loop may be equally well regarded as a map formula_24 with formula_37 or as a continuous map from the unit circle formula_38 to formula_1
:formula_40
This is because formula_38 is the quotient space of formula_42 when formula_43 is identified with formula_44 The set of all loops in formula_1 forms a space called the loop space of formula_2

== Homotopy of paths ==

Paths and loops are central subjects of study in the branch of algebraic topology called homotopy theory. A homotopy of paths makes precise the notion of continuously deforming a path while keeping its endpoints fixed.

Specifically, a homotopy of paths, or path-homotopy, in formula_1 is a family of paths formula_48 indexed by formula_42 such that
* formula_50 and formula_51 are fixed. 
* the map formula_52 given by formula_53 is continuous. 
The paths formula_54 and formula_55 connected by a homotopy are said to be homotopic (or more precisely path-homotopic, to distinguish between the relation defined on all continuous functions between fixed spaces). One can likewise define a homotopy of loops keeping the base point fixed.

The relation of being homotopic is an equivalence relation on paths in a topological space. The equivalence class of a path formula_56 under this relation is called the homotopy class of formula_57 often denoted formula_58 

== Path composition ==

One can compose paths in a topological space in the following manner. Suppose formula_56 is a path from formula_20 to formula_61 and formula_62 is a path from formula_61 to formula_64. The path formula_65 is defined as the path obtained by first traversing formula_56 and then traversing formula_62:
:formula_68
Clearly path composition is only defined when the terminal point of formula_56 coincides with the initial point of formula_70 If one considers all loops based at a point formula_6 then path composition is a binary operation. 

Path composition, whenever defined, is not associative due to the difference in parametrization. However it associative up to path-homotopy. That is, formula_72 Path composition defines a group structure on the set of homotopy classes of loops based at a point formula_8 in formula_2 The resultant group is called the fundamental group of formula_1 based at formula_6 usually denoted formula_77 

In situations calling for associativity of path composition &quot;on the nose,&quot; a path in formula_1 may instead be defined as a continuous map from an interval formula_79 to formula_1 for any real formula_81 (Such a path is called a Moore path.) A path formula_56 of this kind has a length formula_83 defined as formula_84 Path composition is then defined as before with the following modification:
:formula_85

Whereas with the previous definition, formula_57 formula_62, and formula_65 all have length formula_89 (the length of the domain of the map), this definition makes formula_90 What made associativity fail for the previous definition is that although formula_91 and formula_92have the same length, namely formula_93 the midpoint of formula_91 occurred between formula_62 and formula_96 whereas the midpoint of formula_92 occurred between formula_56 and formula_62. With this modified definition formula_91 and formula_92 have the same length, namely formula_102 and the same midpoint, found at formula_103 in both formula_91 and formula_92; more generally they have the same parametrization throughout.

== Fundamental groupoid ==

There is a categorical picture of paths which is sometimes useful. Any topological space formula_1 gives rise to a category where the objects are the points of formula_1 and the morphisms are the homotopy classes of paths. Since any morphism in this category is an isomorphism, this category is a groupoid called the fundamental groupoid of formula_2 Loops in this category are the endomorphisms (all of which are actually automorphisms). The automorphism group of a point formula_8 in formula_1 is just the fundamental group based at formula_8. More generally, one can define the fundamental groupoid on any subset formula_112 of formula_113 using homotopy classes of paths joining points of formula_114 This is convenient for Van Kampen&#x27;s Theorem.

<doc id="1189567" wikidata="Q712817" url="?curid=1189567" title="Georgios Grivas">
<text>Georgios Grivas (; 6 June 1897 – 27 January 1974), also known by his nickname Digenis (), was the Cypriot founder and leader of the Greek and Greek Cypriot paramilitary organisations Organization X (1942–1949), EOKA (1955–1959) and EOKA B (1971–1974).

A specialist of guerrilla and asymmetric warfare, he was one of the main actors in the Cypriot War of Independence, securing the independence of Cyprus against the British Empire. He died only six months prior to the 1974 Cypriot coup and subsequent Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

==Early life==
Grivas was born in Trikomo on 23 May 1898, the fourth child of Greek Cypriot parents Kalomira Hatzimichael and Theodoros Grivas. He grew up in Trikomo. After attending his village school, he studied at the Pancyprian Gymnasium in Nicosia from 1909 to 1915, living with his grandmother during this time.

==Early military career==
In 1916, Grivas moved to Greece; according to his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; of London, he had left the family home after learning that his father intended him to become a physician. He took Greek citizenship and enrolled at the Hellenic Military Academy. He completed his military studies at the École Militaire in Paris. He graduated in 1919, and joined the Hellenic Army with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant and was immediately posted on the Asia Minor front of the Greco-Turkish War. He served in the Hellenic Army&#x27;s 10th Division and participated in its advance from Smyrna to Panormos (today Bandirma) and Eskişehir, past Bursa and the Battle of Sakarya. With the subsequent retreat of the Hellenic Army from Asia Minor in 1922 (because of the Treaty of Lausanne), he was placed at Redestos in Thrace. He was decorated for his bravery and promoted to Lieutenant. He was later selected to study at the French Military Academy and upon his return to Greece he served in a number of posts, including that of a lecturer at the Hellenic Military Academy. He was promoted to captain in 1925 and to Major in 1935. In 1938, he married Vasiliki Deka, the daughter of an Athenian pharmacist.

==World War II and German occupation==
With the beginning of World War II, Grivas was transferred to the operations department of the central headquarters of the Hellenic Army, working on the strategic defensive plans for Northern Greece. When the Greco-Italian War broke out, Grivas was deployed to the Albanian front in December 1940, and served as Chief of Staff of the 2nd Division.

Following the German-Italian-Bulgarian occupation of Greece during World War II, Grivas founded and led the Organisation &quot;X&quot;, a guerrilla organisation made up of officers of the Greek Army, playing a role in the Greek Resistance to the Axis occupation of Greece. Its activities included spying for the Allied powers and launching attacks and sabotage operations against the occupiers. During the events of December 1944, members of Organisation X, using weapons recovered from the retreating Germans, fought at the Theseon alongside Greek and British monarchist forces to prevent EAM/ELAS fighters to take control of Athens.

In 1946, he retired from the Hellenic Army on his own request with subsequent attempts to enter politics being unsuccessful.

==The EOKA guerrilla campaign==

Following his retirement, Grivas focused on the idea of ridding Cyprus of British colonial rule and eventually uniting it with Greece (Enosis). As a member of the secret Committee for the Cyprus Struggle he took the oath of Enosis together with the newly elected Archbishop Makarios III, with whom he collaborated for preparing the armed struggle. He arrived secretly in Cyprus in October 1954 and began immediately the formation of his guerrilla organisation EOKA. On 1 April 1955 with a declaration that he signed as DIGENIS and a number of bombings against various targets in the four major cities and military installations, he announced the beginning of his campaign for Self Determination – Union with Greece.

He directed the first EOKA operations from his hideout in Nicosia but soon after he moved to the Troodos mountains to lead his guerrilla teams. At the time he wanted only British soldiers and their Greek collaborators to be targeted and prohibited attacks on the Turkish Cypriots. He recruited Grigoris Afxentiou as one of the team leaders, initially of the Famagusta district. Grivas escaped capture twice after he was surrounded by British forces at Spilia in December 1955, leading to the Battle of Spilia, and at Kykkos in May 1956. A month later, chased by the British forces, he was secretly transferred from the mountains by the car of a passionate EOKA fighter, Kostis Efstathiou, also known as &quot;Pachykostis&quot;, and found refuge in a hideout at Limassol from where he directed not only the military activities but also the political campaign, since Archbishop Makarios in March 1956 was exiled by the authorities.

During the struggle, the British colonial administration had offered a reward of 10,000 British pounds plus passage to anywhere in the world for information leading to the arrest of Colonel Grivas.

==Return to Greece==
With the signing of the Zurich-London agreements in early 1959 and the declaration of Cyprus as an independent state Grivas reluctantly ordered cease-fire. His views were at odds with those of Makarios who had accepted the above agreements on behalf of the Greek Cypriot population. In March 1959, Grivas came out of his hideout and departed (in exile, requested by the UK as part of the cease fire agreement) for Athens where he received a hero&#x27;s welcome as the liberator of the Greek Cypriots and was subsequently decorated with the highest honours by the Greek Parliament and the Athens Academy and promoted to the rank of General. Not long after his return, Grivas was persuaded to enter politics as head of a coalition party but soon abandoned this route after the disappointing percentage his party obtained in the general election of 1963.

Grivas returned to Cyprus in 1964 after the outbreak of intercommunal violence between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots to take over the Supreme Command of the Greek Cypriot forces organised under Makarios&#x27;s National Guard as well as the Greek military division sent to Cyprus by the government of George Papandreou to assist in the island&#x27;s defence against a possible Turkish attack. He directed the construction of defence forts and complexes aiming at withstanding a Turkish invasion. On 15 November 1967, Greek Cypriot National Guard under his direct command overran two small villages on the critical Larnaca, Limassol, Nicosia intersection, resulting in the deaths of 27 people, mostly armed Turkish Cypriots as well as Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries at Kofinou and Agios Theodoros. The immediate result of this event was Turkey&#x27;s ultimatum, which prompted the Greek military government to recall both the Greek Division and General Grivas to Athens.

From 1968 to 1969, under strict surveillance, Grivas participated in a resistance movement aiming at deposing the ruling military junta and restoring democracy in Greece, along with a number of Greek Army officers including Colonel Dimitrios Opropoulos and Majors Spyros Moustaklis, Nikolaos Lytras and George Karousos as well as Greek Cypriot students and professionals many of them former EOKA fighters. Grivas began the formation of armed resistance cells in a number of neighbourhoods in Athens which were armed with guns and explosives that were brought in secretly from Cyprus. The organisation, however, was discovered by the authorities and many of its members were arrested.
==Later life and death==
After the discovery of Grivas&#x27; plans by the authorities, he secretly returned to Cyprus on 31 August 1971, where he formed the armed organisation EOKA B, which he used as leverage in his attempts to persuade or force Makarios to change his policy and adopt the line of &quot;Self Determination – Union&quot; with Greece. EOKA B didn&#x27;t overthrow Makarios but the armed struggle led to a vicious circle of violence and anti-violence that amounted to civil war among the Greek-Cypriot Community from 1971 to 1974.

While hiding at a house in Limassol on 27 January 1974, Grivas died of heart failure at the age of 76. The post-Grivas EOKA B then signed a secret agreement with Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis, the &quot;invisible dictator&quot; of Greece, and was controlled directly from Athens. Grivas&#x27; funeral and burial was held on 29 January 1974, in the garden of the house that had been Grivas&#x27; last hideout during the EOKA struggle (1955–1959) and was attended by tens of thousands of Greek Cypriots. Upon his death, the Cypriot Government declared a three-day official mourning and three days later, the Parliament of Cyprus declared General Grivas &quot;A worthy son of the motherland&quot;. The government of Makarios, the target of Grivas&#x27; campaign for enosis, formally boycotted the event.

==Aftermath==
The Second Junta of Greece, under Ioannidis, overthrew Makarios just six months after Grivas&#x27; death. Ioannidis had been planning to overthrow Makarios in spring 1974, but the final decision to act was made on 2 July 1974 after Makarios decided to directly oppose the Ioannidis regime by expelling from the Cypriot National Guard 550 Greek officers. That meant the loss of military control of Cyprus for Greece as well as the humiliation of Ioannidis. The coup d&#x27;état of 15 July 1974 that overthrew Makarios was executed by forces of the Cypriot National Guard under direct instructions from Greece. The National Guard was led by Greek officers and consisted of Greek-Cypriot conscripts. The EOKA B members and other pro-enosis forces joined the National Guard in the afternoon of Monday 15 July 1974 in the fight against Makarios&#x27; forces. The coup was swiftly followed by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July. This invasion took Ioannides by surprise, who failed to prepare Cyprus for a Turkish invasion and failed to coerce the Greek generals whom he had appointed to apply &quot;Plan K&quot; and provide military assistance to Cyprus. That marked the downfall of Ioannidis.

<text>James Justinian Morier (15 August 1782 – 19 March 1849) was a British diplomat and author noted for his novels about the Qajar dynasty in Iran, most famously for the &quot;Hajji Baba&quot; series.

==Early life==

Morier was born in Ottoman Smyrna, the second son of Isaac Morier, a Swiss-born merchant, British by naturalisation, and a member of the London-based Levant Company, and Elizabeth Clara Van Lennep. After private education in England, he worked in his father&#x27;s Smyrna business between 1799 and 1806.

==Diplomatic career==
===Career in Iran===
Through the influence of his uncle, Admiral William Waldegrave, 1st Baron Radstock, he entered the diplomatic service. He first visited Iran in 1808 as secretary to Harford Jones-Brydges, a special British envoy to the Shah, publishing an account of his experiences in 1812 under the title &quot;A Journey through Iran, Armenia and Asia Minor to Constantinople in the years 1808 and 1809&quot;. In 1809 he accompanied the Iranian envoy, Mirza Abul Hasan, to Britain, and in 1810 returned to Iran as Secretary of Embassy on the staff of Sir Gore Ouseley, first Ambassador to Iran. He remained there as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in 1814–1816. After his return to England he published &quot;A second journey through Persia, Armenia, and Asia Minor, to Constantinople, between the years 1810 and 1816&quot;.

===Commissioner to Mexico===
Morier married Harriet Fulke Greville in London in 1820. Between 1824 and 1826 he was special commissioner to Mexico, where he negotiated a British-Mexican Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation ratified in 1827.

==Writing career==
With his knowledge of Eastern life and manners, Morier wrote several entertaining novels. The most popular were &quot;The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan&quot; (1824) and its sequel, &quot;The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan in England&quot; (1828). The former novel is a sort of &quot;Gil Blas&quot; set in Persia. The Persian minister to England is said to have protested in behalf of his government against its satire and manner of speaking. There followed &quot;Zohrab the Hostage&quot; (1832), &quot;Ayesha the Maid of Kars&quot; (1834), and &quot;The Mirza&quot; (1841), all full of brilliant description, character-painting, and delicate satire, and several others of lesser quality.

&quot;The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan&quot; has been reprinted many times, with bibliophile editions from Random House in 1937 designed and illustrated by Cyrus Leroy Baldridge and from The Heritage Press in 1947 illustrated by Honoré Guilbeau. Some later editions have been prefaced by Walter Scott&#x27;s generous appreciation of Morier&#x27;s work, first published in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; in January 1829. A Persian translation of the book was produced by Douglas Craven Phillott.

==Death==
Morier died suddenly in Brighton of &quot;cerebral congestion&quot; on 19 March 1849. His wife died in London in 1858.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Adventures of Hajji Baba&quot; is an American movie, based on the Hajji Baba novels, which was produced in 1954.

Operation Hajji Baba, a humanitarian airlift operation conducted in 1952 by the US Air Force, took its name from the Hajji Baba novels.

Morier is credited with introducing into English the word &quot;&quot;, meaning absurd or foolish talk. It derives from the Turkish word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;empty&quot;.

In 1842, botanist Boiss. published &quot;Moriera&quot; a genus of flowering plants from Central Asia, belonging to the family Brassicaceae in his honour.

<text>Henry Morley (15 September 1822 – 14 May 1894) was an English academic who was one of the earliest professors of English literature in Great Britain. Morley wrote a popular book containing biographies of famous English writers.

==Life==
The son of apothecary Henry Morley, the younger Morley was born in Hatton Garden, London. He was educated at a Moravian Church school in Neuwied, Germany at the age of ten, from 1833 to 1835, then he attended a preparatory school in Stockwell and entered King&#x27;s College London in 1838 for medical studies. Morley graduated in 1843 and became part of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, a professional organization, that same year.

Morley worked as a physician in partnership with another doctor in Madeley, Shropshire, but it turned into a financial failure because of the dishonesty of his partner who was unlicensed. In 1848, he established a school in Manchester and started writing in his spare time. Morley wrote some satirical articles that were published and gained the attention of Charles Dickens.

At Dickens&#x27; invitation, Morley moved to London in 1850 to become an editor of and a contributor to Dickens&#x27; publication, &quot;Household Words&quot;. When that publication dissolved, Morley worked for its successor, &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. From 1859 to 1864, Morley also edited and wrote for &quot;The Examiner&quot;.

From 1865 to 1889, Morley served as Professor of English Literature at University College London, his students including the Indian writer Rabindranath Tagore. Noted for his knowledge of English literature, Morley was considered to be an engaging and warm teacher. He also delivered popular lectures on literature in different parts of Great Britain. He was awarded an honorary LLD degree by the University of Edinburgh in 1879. Henry Morley was a strong supporter of degrees for women. He supported in particular Annie Leigh Browne when she opened in 1882 a residence for women students at Byng Place, renamed College Hall in 1886.

From 1882 to 1889, Morley was principal of University Hall, a research library in Bloomsbury, London. 

Morley&#x27;s biography was written in 1898 by Henry Shaen Solly, his son-in-law and former student.

Morley died on 14 May 1894 in Carisbrooke on the Isle of Wight and is buried at Carisbrooke Cemetery.

==Works==
Morley was the editor of two book series. &quot;Morley&#x27;s Universal Library&quot;, drawing on the concept of a universal library, was published from 1883 by George Routledge. &quot;Cassell&#x27;s National Library&quot; was published from 1886, totalling 209 weekly editions.

Morley was the author of biographies on Bernard Palissy, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Gerolamo Cardano and Clément Marot. He also wrote introductions to two books written by John Locke—the 1884 edition of &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; and the 1889 edition of &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot;.

Morley&#x27;s principal work, however, was &quot;English Writers&quot; (10 volumes 1864-94), coming down to William Shakespeare. His &quot;First Sketch of English Literature&quot;—the study for the larger work—had reached at his death a circulation of 34,000 copies.

<doc id="1189582" wikidata="Q1060890" url="?curid=1189582" title="Shivering">
<text>Shivering (also called shuddering) is a bodily function in response to cold and extreme fear in warm-blooded animals. When the core body temperature drops, the shivering reflex is triggered to maintain homeostasis. Skeletal muscles begin to shake in small movements, creating warmth by expending energy. Shivering can also be a response to fever, as a person may feel cold. During fever, the hypothalamic set point for temperature is raised. The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold until the new set point is reached. Severe chills with violent shivering are called rigors. Rigors occur because the patient&#x27;s body is shivering in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point.

== Understanding Shivering ==
When understanding the concept of shivering it is important to understand the human physiological responses to cold exposure. There are many reactions that humans have to the cold such as “cutaneous vasoconstriction and shivering thermogenesis” these processes “decrease heat loss and increase metabolic heat production”.  

Cutaneous vasoconstriction is the narrowing of blood vessels in the skin reducing blood flow and heat loss to environmental temperatures. This process is one of the many natural defenses&#x27; humans have against cold temperatures.  

Thermogenesis (shivering) is when the body comes in contact with cold temperatures in the environment and the body feels as though it needs to raise its core body to protect itself. This is a primary trigger for the mechanism of heat production in mammalian bodies when exposed to cold. This process generates heat though high speed contractions of the skeletal muscles. It begins by having the hypothalamus triggering a signal in the muscles to contract and relax making heat the excess product of the rapid muscle movement that the process causes.  

== Biological basis ==
Located in the posterior hypothalamus near the wall of the third ventricle is an area called the primary motor center for shivering. This area is normally inhibited by signals from the heat center in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area but is excited by cold signals from the skin and spinal cord. Therefore, this center becomes activated when the body temperature falls even a fraction of a degree below a critical temperature level.

Increased muscular activity results in the generation of heat as a byproduct. Most often, when the purpose of the muscle activity is to produce motion, the heat is wasted energy. In shivering, the heat is the main intended product and is utilized for warmth.

Newborn babies, infants, and young children experience a greater (net) heat loss than adults because of greater surface-area-to-volume ratio. As they cannot shiver to maintain body heat, they rely on non-shivering thermogenesis. Children have an increased amount of brown adipose tissue (increased vascular supply, and high mitochondrial density), and, when cold-stressed, will have greater oxygen consumption and will release norepinephrine. Norepinephrine will react with lipases in brown fat to break down fat into triglycerides. Triglycerides are then metabolized to glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids. These are then further degraded in the needed heat-generating process to form CO2 and water. Chemically, in mitochondria, the proton gradient producing the proton electromotive force that is ordinarily used to synthesize ATP is instead bypassed to produce heat directly.

Shivering can also appear after surgery. This is known as postanesthetic shivering.

In humans, shivering can also be caused by cognition. This is known as psychogenic shivering.

==Shivering and the elderly==

The functional capacity of the thermoregulatory system alters with aging, reducing the resistance of elderly people to extreme external temperatures. The shiver response may be greatly diminished or even absent in the elderly, resulting in a significant drop in mean deep body temperature upon exposure to cold. Standard tests of thermoregulatory function show a markedly different rate of decline of thermoregulatory processes in different individuals with ageing.

<text>Lewis Morris (April 8, 1726 – January 22, 1798) was an American Founding Father, landowner, and developer from Morrisania, New York, presently part of Bronx County. He signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence as a delegate to the Continental Congress from New York.

==Early life and family==
Morris was born on April 8, 1726, at his family&#x27;s estate, Morrisania, presently part of Bronx County, in what was then the Province of New York. He was the third Lewis Morris in the Morris family. He was the son of Lewis Morris (1698–1762) and Katrintje &quot;Catherine&quot; Staats (1697–1731). After his mother died, his father married Sarah Gouverneur (1714–1786). He graduated from Yale College in 1746, and upon his father&#x27;s death in 1762, he inherited the bulk of the estate.

Morris&#x27; father had seven children, including his siblings, Staats Long Morris (1728–1800) and Richard Morris (1730–1810), and his half-siblings, Mary Lawrence, Gouverneur Morris (1752–1816), Isabella, and Catherine. His uncle was Robert Hunter Morris (1700–1764), the governor of Pennsylvania. His cousin by marriage was William Paterson (1745–1806), the governor of New Jersey and father-in-law of Stephen Van Rensselaer, the lieutenant governor of New York, who was the brother of Philip Schuyler Van Rensselaer, mayor of Albany, New York. Anthony Walton White (1750–1803), a Continental Army general, was his cousin through Morris&#x27; aunt, Elizabeth Morris (1712–).

===Family history===
His great-grandfather, Richard Morris (died 1672), immigrated to New York through Barbados after being part of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army in the English Civil War of 1648. He purchased the first tract of land in the Bronx that became the basis for the Morrisania manor. Richard and his young wife died, leaving behind an infant son, Lewis Morris (1671–1746). Richard&#x27;s brother, Colonel Lewis Morris, also of Barbados, came to Morrisania to help manage the estate owned by his infant nephew. Col. Morris and his wife were childless.

When he came of age, Lewis Morris expanded and patented the estate. He married Isabella and went on to serve as the 8th colonial governor of New Jersey. Morris was a popular governor who championed land owning rights for the colonists. Morristown, New Jersey, was named for him.

==Career==
In 1769, he was elected to the New York General Assembly. In 1774, as the Revolution drew near, he resigned from the Admiralty Court.

===American Revolution===
When active revolution began, he was a member of the New York Provincial Congress, the revolutionary government, from 1775 until 1777. That body, in turn, sent Morris to the Continental Congress for those same years. While in Congress, he was an active supporter of independence and signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. When warned by his brother Staats Morris, who was a general in the British army, of the consequences that would follow his signing of the rebellious document, Morris stated, &quot;Damn the consequences. Give me the pen.&quot;

In 1777, Lewis returned to New York, became a county judge of Westchester County, and was appointed a member of the New York State Senate representing the Southern District, which consisted of Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond, Suffolk and Westchester counties. He served in the 1st New York State Legislature, which began on September 9, 1777, until the end of the 4th Legislature, on July 1, 1781.

His eldest three sons served during the Revolutionary War and had distinguished military careers.

===Post-Revolution===
Beginning on July 1, 1783, he returned to the New York State Senate and served in the 7th Legislature through to the end of the 13th Legislature, ending on June 30, 1790. In 1788, when the New York convention met to ratify the U.S. Constitution, he was one of the delegates. Morris was a Federalist presidential elector in the 1796 election and cast his votes for John Adams and Thomas Pinckney.

In 1784, Morris was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. On May 1 of the same year, he was appointed to the first Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and served until his death, when he was replaced by Simeon De Witt.

==Personal life==

On September 24, 1749, Lewis married Mary Walton (1727–1794), a member of a well-known merchant family. Maria was the daughter of Jacob Walton and Maria (née Beekman) Walton. They had ten children:

* Catherine Morris (1751–1835), who married Thomas Lawrence (1744–1823).
* Mary Morris (1752–1776).
* Col. Lewis V. Morris (1754–1824), who married Ann B. Elliott (1762–1848), sister-in-law of Congressman Daniel Huger.
* Gen. Jacob Morris (1755–1844), who married Mary Cox (1758–1827) (Morris, New York is named after him).
* Sarah Morris (born 1757), who died young.
* Lt. William Walton Morris (1760–1832), aide-de-camp to General Anthony Wayne who married Sarah Carpender.
* Helena Magdalena Morris (1762–1840), who married John Rutherfurd (1760–1840), a Senator from New Jersey
* James Morris (1764–1827), who married Helen Van Cortlandt (1768–1812), daughter of Augustus Van Cortlandt and granddaughter of Frederick Van Cortlandt.
* Capt. Staats Morris (1765–1826), who married Everarda van Braam Houckgeest (1765–1816), the daughter of Andreas van Braam Houckgeest and Baroness Catharina C.G. van Reeds van Oudtshoorn.
* Capt. Richard Valentine Morris (1768–1815), who married Anne Walton (1773–1858)

After the war, Morris had to rebuild the family estate, which had been looted and burned by the British when they occupied New York. In 1790, he offered the land, now part of the South Bronx neighborhood of Morrisania, as the site of the U.S. capital. He died on the estate and is buried in the family vault beneath St. Ann&#x27;s Church in the Bronx.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest son, Lewis V. Morris, he was grandfather to Lewis Morris (1785–1863) and Sabina Elliott Morris (1789–1857). Lewis Morris (b. 1785) was the father of Charles Manigault Morris (1820–1895), a Confederate officer. Sabina married her first cousin, Robert Walter Rutherfurd (1788–1852), the son of John Rutherfurd and Helena Morris, and was the mother of Lewis Morris Rutherfurd (1816–1892), a pioneering astrophotographer who took the first telescopic photographs of the moon and sun, as well as many stars and planets.

Through his son, Staats Morris, his great-grandson was Daniel François van Braam Morris (b. 1840), a Dutchman and governor of Celebes in the Dutch East Indies. A great-granddaughter of his grandfather, Lewis Morris, named Mary Antill was married to Gerritt G. Lansing, himself a brother of Congressman John Lansing. John Lansing&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, was married to Edward Livingston, a great-grandson of Philip Livingston.

== In popular culture ==
Lewis Morris is portrayed by Ronald Kross in the 1969 Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot; and by Howard Caine in the 1972 film. Although Morris was chairman of the New York delegation to the Second Continental Congress, he abstained (&quot;courteously&quot;) on every vote, claiming that the New York Provincial Congress never gave Morris explicit instructions on anything. However, when George Washington noted in a dispatch that Morris&#x27;s estates were destroyed by the British, but his family was taken to safety in Connecticut, Morris abandons his lack of instructions and moves to sign the Declaration.

<doc id="1189596" wikidata="Q3398347" url="?curid=1189596" title="Lewis Morris (1701–1765)">
<text>Lewis Morris (2 March 1701 – 11 April 1765) was a Welsh hydrographer, antiquary, poet and lexicographer, the eldest of the Morris brothers of Anglesey.

Lewis Morris was the eldest son of Morris ap Rhisiart Morris, a farmer, of Llanfihangel-Tre&#x27;r-Beirdd in Anglesey.

His bardic name was Llewelyn Ddu o Fôn (&quot;Black Llewelyn [Lewis] of Anglesey&quot;). The correspondence between him and his younger brothers is a valuable historical source. In 1751, he founded the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion along with his brother Richard.

==Career as a cartographer==

Although there is no record of his having had any further education, Lewis Morris began his career as an estate-surveyor, and was employed by the Meyrick family of Bodorgan. He worked as a Customs official from 1729, and was later involved in the Cardiganshire mining industry. However, he is perhaps best known for his hydrographic surveys of the Welsh Coast.

The idea for the survey probably arose while he was working as a Customs official in Holyhead, where he would have come into contact with many seafarers. At this time there were no accurate and up-to-date hydrographic charts of the Welsh coast and many ships and people died as a result.

Morris put his idea for a survey to the Admiralty, but they showed little interest and he was obliged to undertake the work at his own expense. The result of his efforts was the publication of &quot;Plans of harbours, bars, bays, and roads in St. George&#x27;s-Channel&quot; in 1748.

While this work had a major impact on the safety of shipping around the Welsh coast at the time; Morris&#x27;s contribution to British cartography was for many years eclipsed by his other achievements.

==Later career==
In his spare time, Morris began prospecting for lead, and during the 1750s he was in constant dispute with his employers and was prosecuted and lost his job as collector of tolls at Aberdyfi. He visited London several times in order to contest court cases relating to his industrial activities; whilst there, he assisted his brother Richard in setting up the Cymmrodorion Society. However, Lewis&#x27;s long-term project, the publication of a dictionary, was never completed.

He died on 11 April 1765 and is buried in Llangunnor Churchyard in Wales.

<text>Sir Lewis Morris (23 January 1833 – 12 November 1907) was a Welsh academic and politician. He was also a popular poet of the Anglo-Welsh school.

==Background==
Born in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire in south-west Wales to Lewis Edward William Morris and Sophia Hughes, he first attended Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School there (1841–47). Then in 1847 he transferred to Cowbridge Grammar School on the appointment to it of the energetically reviving and academically gifted young headmaster, Hugo Harper. There &quot;he gave promise of his future classical scholarship by writing a prize poem on Pompeii&quot;. In 1850 he was one of about thirty Cowbridge boys who followed Harper to Sherborne whither the latter was bound on a similar mission of resuscitating a moribund school. Such &quot;swarming&quot; in the wake of a charismatic headmaster was typical of the period. Morris and Harper remained lifelong friends. He studied classics at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating in 1856: the first student in thirty years to obtain first-class honours in both his preliminary and his final examinations. In 1868 he married Florence Pollard.

==Career==
He then became a lawyer. He was Liberal candidate for Pembroke Boroughs in 1886 but lost to his Conservative opponent. He was Liberal candidate for Carmarthen Boroughs in 1892 but retired before the poll. He was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1895, and narrowly missed being appointed Poet Laureate, possibly because of his association with Oscar Wilde. One of his most famous poems is &quot;Love&#x27;s Suicide&quot;.

He is buried at the parish church of Saint Cynnwr in Llangunnor.

<doc id="1189604" wikidata="Q8015942" url="?curid=1189604" title="William Mure (scholar)">
<text>William Mure (10 July 1799 – 1 April 1860) was a Scottish scholar and Conservative politician. He sat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1846 to 1855 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Renfrewshire and was Laird of Caldwell in Ayrshire.

==Early life==
William Mure was born on 10 July 1799 at Caldwell House, near Ayrshire. He was the eldest son of William Mure of Caldwell (d. 1831), colonel of the Renfrew militia, and Lord Rector of Glasgow University from 1793 to 1794, and Anne Blair Mure (d. 1854). She was the eldest daughter of Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet (1741–1787) of Dunskey, Wigtownshire. His paternal grandfather was William Mure (1718–1776), Baron of the Exchequer, and a descendant of the Mures of Rowallan. His younger brother was M.P. and judge David Mure, Lord Mure (1810–1891).

He was educated at Westminster School, at the University of Edinburgh, and afterwards in Germany at the University of Bonn.

===Succession===
Mure succeeded to the Caldwell estates on his father&#x27;s death, 9 February 1831.

==Career==
When he was about twenty-two he contributed to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; an article on Spanish literature. His first independent publication was &quot;Brief Remarks on the Chronology of the Egyptian Dynasties&quot; (against Champollion), issued in 1829; (London, 8vo). It was followed in 1832 by &quot;A Dissertation on the Calendar and Zodiac of Ancient Egypt&quot; (Edinburgh, 8vo).

In 1838, Mure began a tour in Greece, leaving Ancona for Corfu on 17 February. He studied the &#x27;topography of Ithaca, and visited Acarnania, Delphi, Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnese. He published an interesting &quot;Journal of a Tour in Greece and the Ionian Islands&quot; in 1842 (Edinburgh, 8vo). His principal work, &quot;A Critical History of the Language and Literature of Antient Greece,&quot; was issued 1850–7, London, 8vo ; 2nd edit. 1859, 8vo ; it consists of five volumes, but deals only with a part of the subject, viz. the early history of writing, Homer, Hesiod, the early lyric poets and historians Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon. It contains no account of the dramatists, orators, or any literature subsequent to 380 B.C. Mure also published &quot;The Commercial Policy of Pitt and Peel,&quot; 1847, 8vo ; &quot;Selections from the Family Papers [of the Mures] preserved at Caldwell,&quot; Maitland Club, 1854, 8vo ; &quot;Remarks on the Appendices to the second vol. 3rd edit, of Mr. Grote&#x27;s History of Greece,&quot; London, 1851, 8vo; and &quot;National Criticism in 1858&quot; (on a criticism of Mure&#x27;s &#x27;History of the Literature of Greece&#x27;), London, 1858, 8vo.

===Political career===
He was M.P. for Renfrewshire from 1846 to 1855 in the conservative interest, but seldom spoke in the house. He was created D.C.L. by Oxford University on 9 June 1833. He was a man of commanding presence, winning manners, and kindly disposition. He was, like his father, for many years colonel of the Renfrewshire militia, and, like his father and grandfather, was Lord Rector of Glasgow University from 1847 to 1848.

==Personal life==
On 7 February 1825, Mure married Laura Markham, the second daughter of William Markham of Becca Hall, Yorkshire, and granddaughter of William Markham (1719–1807) the Archbishop of York from 1776 to 1807, and had issue three sons and three daughters.
*William Mure (1830–1880), who was Lieutenant-Colonel in the Scots Fusilier Guards, M.P. for Renfrewshire from 1874 to 1880.
*Charles Reginald Mure, who became an officer in the 43rd light infantry.
*Emma Mure (1833–1911), who married Thomas Lister, 3rd Baron Ribblesdale (1828–1876)

He died at Kensington Park Gardens, London, on 1 April 1860, aged 60. Mure is buried in the parish church of Neilston.

<text>Juan Fernando Arango Sáenz (born 16 May 1980) is a Venezuelan former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. Arango was considered by some in the sport as the greatest Venezuelan footballer of all time.
He spent the better part of his professional career in La Liga with Mallorca, appearing in 196 official games, and also played several years with Borussia Mönchengladbach for which he signed at the age of 29.

Arango was Venezuela&#x27;s record holder in international caps and goals for several years, scoring 22 times in 129 matches between 1999 and 2015. He represented the nation in six Copa América tournaments.

==Club career==
===Early years and Mallorca===
Arango&#x27;s parents hailed from Colombia, having immigrated to Venezuela before he was born, in the city of Maracay. He started playing as a professional at the age of sixteen with Nueva Cádiz FC, which ascended to the Venezuelan Primera División the following season under the name Zulia FC.

The following year, Arango joined Caracas FC but, after six months playing with the team he was bought by Mexico&#x27;s C.F. Monterrey. He represented two other clubs in the latter country, C.F. Pachuca and Puebla FC, until 2004, when he joined La Liga side RCD Mallorca in Spain (coached by Benito Floro, also his boss at Monterrey) on a one-year link, with an option for a further three.

On 20 March 2005, Arango suffered a serious injury after a brutal collision with Sevilla FC&#x27;s Javi Navarro. He fell unconscious, broke his cheekbone, swallowed his tongue and got serious cuts in his face; he returned to play a month later and, in the following season, was the team&#x27;s top scorer with 11 league goals.

In 2006, EFE chose Arango as the third best Latin American player in the Spanish league, with the first place taken by Pablo Aimar. The following year, he also obtained a Spanish passport, in March. On 9 March 2008, he scored his first hat-trick for Mallorca, in a 7–1 home thrashing of Recreativo de Huelva, with teammate Dani Güiza – who finished as the campaign&#x27;s Pichichi – adding two; he only missed one league game from 2005 to 2008 combined.

===Borussia Mönchengladbach===

On 26 June 2009, as his contract was due to expire at the end of 2009–10, Arango was sold to Borussia Mönchengladbach for €3.6 million, penning a three-year contract. In his third season in the Bundesliga he netted six goals in 34 games and also provided 12 assists, as his team finished fourth and qualified for the UEFA Champions League.

On 10 December 2012, Gladbach manager Lucien Favre hailed Arango as one of the best left-footed players in the world, after the Venezuelan scored a 48-yard stunner in a 2–0 defeat of 1. FSV Mainz 05 the previous day. In the following year, he was ranked as the most popular footballer in the world by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics.

Arango scored his first goal of the 2013–14 campaign on 24 August 2013, but in a 2–4 away defeat to Bayer 04 Leverkusen. He also found the net in his team&#x27;s next league fixture, opening the scoring in a 4–1 home success over SV Werder Bremen.

===Tijuana===
Arango returned to Mexico at the age of 34, signing with Club Tijuana on 22 May 2014. In April of the following year, he was handed a two-match ban by the Mexican Football Federation after footage showed him biting Monterrey player Jesús Zavala in an action that eluded the referee.

===Late career===
On 28 January 2016, Arango joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Aged 36, he returned to both his country and Zulia one year later.

Arango then had another spell with the Cosmos, leaving in January 2018.

==International career==
At the 2004 Copa América, Arango appeared in all three group stage matches for Venezuela. In the 2007 edition, held in his country, he helped the national team finish first in the group stage, and scored in the quarterfinals against Uruguay, but in a 4–1 defeat.

Also in that year, Arango was chosen national team captain by newly appointed coach César Farías. In the 2011 Copa América in Argentina, he helped the &quot;Vinotinto&quot; to a best-ever fourth-place finish in the continental competition, scoring in the third-place match, a 1–4 loss against Peru for what was his 100th cap.

In his 116th international appearance, Arango levelled the record for the most goals scored for Venezuela with 22 goals, scoring in the 56th minute against Bolivia in a 1–1 draw for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers on 7 June 2013.

==Style of play==
A left-footed playmaker, who was known for his technical skills, leadership and ability both to score and create goals, courtesy of his striking ability, crossing and passing, Arango was a classic number ten, who was capable of playing both as an attacking midfielder and as a winger. Nicknamed &quot;Arangol&quot;, he was also a dead ball specialist, who was highly regarded by pundits for his exceptional accuracy from free kicks and his ability to bend the ball.

==Personal life==
Arango is the son-in law of Argenis Tortolero, brother-in-law of Edson Tortolero, and father of Juan Arango Jr., all of whom were professional footballers.

<doc id="1189614" wikidata="Q701064" url="?curid=1189614" title="The Perfect Score">
<text>The Perfect Score is a 2004 American teen comedy-heist film directed by Brian Robbins and starring Chris Evans, Erika Christensen, Bryan Greenberg, Scarlett Johansson, Darius Miles, and Leonardo Nam.

The film focuses on a group of six New Jersey high school students whose futures will be jeopardized if they fail the upcoming SAT exam. They conspire to break into a regional office of the Lawrence Township, New Jersey–based Educational Testing Service (ETS), which prepares and distributes the SAT, and steal the answers to the exam, so they can all get perfect scores. The film deals with themes of one&#x27;s future, morality, individuality, and feelings.

&quot;The Perfect Score&quot; has similarities to other high school films, including &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985) and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993), which are often referenced throughout the film. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $10 million.

==Plot==
Everyman high school student Kyle needs a high score on the SAT to get into Cornell University&#x27;s architecture program. He constantly compares himself to his older brother Larry, who is now living above his parents&#x27; garage. Kyle&#x27;s best friend, Matty, wants to get a high score to go to the same college as his girlfriend, but he is an underachiever who had previously received a low score on his PSAT. They feel the SAT is blocking their futures.

The two boys realize fellow student Francesca Curtis&#x27; father owns the building that houses the regional office of ETS, where the SAT answers are located. She initially doesn&#x27;t want to help but reconsiders, saying &quot;What the hell? It sounds like fun.&quot; Meanwhile, Kyle is attracted to Anna Ross, the second-highest-ranked student in the school, and he tells her about the plan. Anna had bombed a previous SAT and needs a good score to get into Brown University.

Matty doesn&#x27;t like the fact that Anna now knows about the plan and rants, right in front of stoner Roy, who then has to be included in the heist. Finally, Anna tells the school basketball star Desmond Rhodes, who needs a score of 900 or better to join the basketball team at St. John&#x27;s University.

An early attempt to break into the ETS offices fails, but they then devise another plan. On the eve of the exam, Francesca will arrange for Kyle and Matty to have a meeting near the top floor, staying after closing. The other three will wait outside and watch the night guard until Francesca, Kyle, and Matty have successfully stolen the answers.

The plan initially goes well, with Francesca, Kyle, and Matty successfully avoiding security cameras and the night guard. However, the answers are located on a computer, and only the technical genius Roy can crack the password; he and the other two get into the building, and Roy correctly guesses the password after seeing a photograph of an employee. Still, the answers can&#x27;t be printed, so the group decides to take the test with their combined knowledge and get the answers that way. In the early hours of the morning, they are finished and have all the answers written down.

Just then, the guard comes up the stairs, and they try to escape through the ceiling; however, Francesca is left behind and is about to be discovered, so Matty sacrifices himself to save her. Everyone else escapes, but each faces a certain confrontation before the exam. Kyle&#x27;s brother asks him if he&#x27;s really worse than a thief, Matty is bailed out by Francesca, Anna finds independence from her parents, and Desmond&#x27;s mother convinces Roy to quit drugs.

Before the SAT testing begins, the group realizes that, although it will help get them what they want, they would be better off without cheating. Roy grabs the answers and randomly distributes them in the bathroom. After the decision, Matty comments that &quot;this whole thing was for nothing.&quot; Kyle replies, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say nothing&quot;, as he glances at Anna. Matty and Francesca also share a look, as they have also presumably started a relationship.

Each person eventually gets their desired test score without the answers: Kyle&#x27;s dream of becoming an architect is still alive by attending Syracuse University, Desmond ends up going to St. John&#x27;s, Matty becomes an actor, Francesca writes a novel (which is about six kids who conspire to steal the answers to the SAT), and Anna decides to travel to Europe for a while before starting college. Roy explains that he earned the highest SAT in the county, and, guided by Desmond&#x27;s mom, he gets a GED. He then puts his untapped intelligence to use through programming, becoming a successful video game designer.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 109 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Neither funny nor suspenseful, this heist/teen flick also fails to explore its potentially socially relevant premise.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; critic Keith Uhlich called it an &quot;MTV film that extreme right-wing moralists can be proud of, as it posits a quintessentially American world of racial, intellectual, and sexual conformity.&quot; Many compared the film unfavorably with &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, and many even called it a rip-off. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote the film off as being &quot;like &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; recast as a video game for simpletons.&quot; Likewise, Roger Ebert awarded the film two stars out of four, calling the film &quot;too palatable. It maintains a tone of light seriousness, and it depends on the caper for too much of its entertainment value.&quot; Ebert&#x27;s review went on to point out that &quot;The Perfect Score&quot; was given a wide release, but that &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot;, a teen drama film that received much more acclaim, was given a very limited release.

===Box office===
The film opened in 2,208 theaters and grossed $4.8 million, making for a $2,207 per-theater average. Placing fifth over the weekend, the film saw sharp declines in the following weeks and ended its domestic run with $10.3 million.

<text>Lindley Murray (1745 – 16 February 1826) was an American Quaker lawyer, writer, and grammarian, best known for his English-language grammar books used in schools in England and the United States.

Murray practised law in New York. As the colonies began to fight for independence with the American Revolution (1765–1783) and in the lead-up to the Revolutionary War, Murray sat on the Committee of Sixty and the Committee of One Hundred to manage events in the Province of New York. Some Quakers did not want him to be associated with a public committee. Still, he sat on the committee to protect his family&#x27;s shipping interests, which would be inhibited by the Continental Association&#x27;s nonimportation clause. Murray spent the first half of the Revolutionary War in Islip, Long Island, living leisurely. With British troops in control of Manhattan, Murray returned to the island and joined his father in the import-export and shipping businesses that made him rich during the second half of the war.

In 1783, Murray retired, and one year later, he left America for England. Settling at Holgate, near York, he devoted the rest of his life to literary pursuits. His first book was &quot;Power of Religion on the Mind&quot; (1787). In 1795, he issued his &quot;Grammar of the English Language&quot;. This was followed by &quot;English Exercises&quot;, and the &quot;English Reader&quot;. These books passed through several editions, and the &quot;Grammar&quot; was the standard textbook for fifty years throughout England and America. While he was able, he was an active member of the local Quaker Meeting.

==Colonial America==
===Early life and education===
Lindley Murray was born in 1745, in Harper Tavern, near Swatara Township, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, His father, Robert Murray, a Quaker, was one of the leading New York merchants. His mother, Mary Lindley Murray, was a Quaker. Mary&#x27;s father, Thomas Lindley, also a member of the Society of Friends, immigrated from Ireland to Pennsylvania in 1718. Lindley was the eldest of the Murrays&#x27; twelve children, five of whom made it to adulthood. They included Lindley, John, Susannah, and Beulah, who were alive at the time of their mother&#x27;s death. Susannah was married to Col. Gilbert Colden Willett, a British officer, and Beulah was married to Martin Hoffman. John married Catharine Bowne.

As he was growing up, Murray saw and met with people from around the world and heard the latest news of those who visited his parents. He received an education founded on values of the Age of Enlightenment. When six years old, he was sent to a Quaker school in Philadelphia, but soon departed for North Carolina with his parents, where they lived until 1753. They then moved to New York, where Murray attended school, but it proved difficult. Against his wishes, at fourteen, he was sent to work at his father&#x27;s accounting firm; Murray was mainly interested in science and literature. He left home to study at a Burlington, New Jersey boardingschool, and started to study French. His parents brought him back to New York and hired a private tutor. His father still wanted him to go into business, but in a letter, Lindley argued so convincingly for a literary career that his father&#x27;s lawyer suggested letting Murray study law.

===Law career===
In 1761, Murray studied law under Samuel Kissam, his father&#x27;s attorney and John Jay&#x27;s teacher. Murray passed the bar in 1765 and established his law practice in the Province of New York in 1767. He joined the Debating Club to exchange viewpoints, as did Jay and other sons of prominent families. Murray left his practice to live on Long Island for the first four years of the Revolutionary War. He returned to New York in 1779. Murray retired in 1783.

===Marital life===
Murray was married on 22 June 1767, in New York City, to Hannah Dobson, the daughter of Thomas Dobson. They had no children. Murray was a Quaker throughout his life. 

Murray and his wife followed his father to England by 1770 and lived there for up to four years. Once he returned to Colonial America, he was among the Quaker founders and a director of the Union Library Society, with about 1,000 volumes.

==American Revolution==
Conflicts between colonists and their British rulers led to the American Revolutionary War. The colonists who wanted to break away from British governance were patriots; those who remained loyal to The Crown were loyalists. A nonimportation clause of Article 10 of the Continental Association called for a complete ban on British goods effective 1 February 1775. The Committee of Sixty in New York saw it as their mission to prevent British goods from being unloaded from ships onto Colonial land. According to Monaghan, Murray joined the committee to protect his family&#x27;s import and shipping-related businesses, and it is not likely that he was a patriot. Not all of the members were patriots; about 22 committee members became loyalists.

Murray&#x27;s father, Robert, tried to have British goods unloaded starting 1 February, when a ship arrived at his dock, but was unsuccessful. In the middle of the month, a ship that he owned, with his goods from Britain on it, was prevented from docking. Robert sent a ship from his business in Elizabeth, New Jersey to come alongside the loaded &quot;Beulah&quot; near Staten Island. Murray family members and crew from the ships unloaded 1.5 or 2 tons of cargo onto the ship from Elizabeth. The clandestine event was discovered, harming Robert&#x27;s and other Murray family members&#x27; reputation and financial position. The Committee of Sixty were faulted by other colonies for not preventing the ship from being unloaded. Robert was nearly banned from the city.

The Committee of Sixty grew to the Committee of One Hundred and Murray remained on the committee, although he continued to get pressure from Quakers to remove himself from the public committee. He dealt with the anger that some of the city&#x27;s residents had about the &quot;Beulah&quot; affair.

With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (19 April 1775 – 3 September 1783), Murray went with his wife to Islip, Long Island, where they lived for four years, fishing, shooting, and sailing. He returned to New York in 1779.
Murray left the city that was in turmoil at the beginning of the war. Over the time he was gone, the British gained control of the city. Since he was considered to be loyal to the British troops, he may have lived in the city safely. In 1779, Murray decided to work for his father, Robert Murray, as a merchant. Murray earned a fortune by the end of the war. The British troops left the city after the signing of the Treaty of Paris (3 September 1783). Once the soldiers left the city, loyalists did not benefit from their protection.

After he retired, Murray and his wife Hannah moved to a manor that he named Bellevue. (Bellevue Hospital is named after the estate.) His estate was near his father, about north of the city (now Lower Manhattan). He had developed a painful muscular problem, and had little success with treatments he received.

==England==
===Later years===
In hopes of improving his health, Murray and his wife left America and moved to England for a milder climate in the summer of 1784. He never returned. Murray was a recorded minister of the York Monthly Meeting for eleven years until his voice failed. For the last 16 years of his life, he never left the house. Murray died on 16 February 1826, near York, England. Hannah died on 25 September 1834.

===Literary pursuits===
In England, he spent his time in literary pursuits at Holgate House, near York. His library became noted for its theological, (English linguistics), and historical treasures. He studied botany, and his garden was said to have more varieties of plants than the Royal Gardens at Kew. He composed his grammar books there in the summer house at Holgate House.

Murray&#x27;s first published work, &quot;The Power of Religion on the Mind&quot; was originally published in 1787, and it was in its 20th edition in 1842. It was twice translated into French. &quot;Extracts from the Writings of divers Eminent Men representing the Evils of Stage Plays, &amp;c.&quot; was added to the 8th edition in 1795.

As requested by teachers at a Friends&#x27; school for girls in York, he wrote suitable lesson books, including his &quot;English Grammar&quot; that was published in 1795. The work became rapidly popular; it went through nearly fifty editions, was edited, abridged, simplified, and enlarged in England and America, and for a long time was used in schools to the exclusion of all other grammar books. Influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment, Murray&#x27;s book won Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s approval and is said to have inspired anti-slavery sentiment in America and abroad.

In 1816, an edition corrected by the author was issued in 2 volumes. An &#x27;Abridgment&#x27; of this version by Murray, issued two years later, went through more than 120 editions of 10,000 each. In 1835, it was printed at the New England Institution for the Blind in embossed characters. Two years later, it was translated into Marathi and published in Bombay. &quot;English Exercises&quot; followed (1797), with &quot;A Key&quot; (1847). Murray&#x27;s &quot;English Reader&quot;, &quot;Sequel&quot;, and &quot;Introduction&quot;, issued respectively in 1799, 1800, and 1801, were equally successful, as well as the &quot;Lecteur Francais&quot;, 1802, and &quot;Introduction to the Lecteur Francais&quot;, 1807. &quot;An English Spelling Book&quot;, 1804, and was translated into Spanish (1841). &quot;First Book for Children&quot; was published with portrait and woodcuts in 1859. In addition to the praises that his works , he was criticised for his failure to provide sufficient etymology and to have published mistakes.

The sales of the &quot;Grammar&quot;, &quot;Exercises&quot;, &quot;Key&quot;, and &quot;Lecteur Francais&quot; brought Murray in each case £700, and he devoted the whole sum to philanthropic objects. The copyright of his religious works he presented to his publishers. By his will, a sum of money for the purchase and distribution of religious literature was vested in trustees in America. When the Retreat for the Insane was founded in York by William Tuke in 1792, Murray continued Tuke&#x27;s efforts to introduce a humane system of treatment.

==Legacy==
There are two historical markers for Murray in Harper Tavern, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania on PA 934, one of them .2 mile north of US 22. The other at the corner of Bellegrove Road (PA 934) &amp; Jonestown Road. Both markers have the same wording: &quot;Famous grammarian, author of the English Grammar, was born 7 June 1745, in a house near this point. Robert Murray, his father, owned a mill here from 1745 to 1746.&quot; 

Built in 1850, the one-room Lindley Murray schoolhouse of East Hanover Township, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, was named for Murray.

<doc id="1189618" wikidata="Q6768996" url="?curid=1189618" title="Mark Napier (historian)">
<text>Mark Napier (24 July 1798 – 23 November 1879) was a Scottish lawyer, biographer and historical author. He was called to the Bar, practised as an advocate, and was made Sheriff of Dumfries and Galloway. Napier wrote from a strongly Cavalier and Jacobite standpoint. He published Memoirs of the Napiers, of Montrose, and of Graham of Claverhouse, the last of which gave rise to controversy.

Napier was a member of the Edinburgh Calotype Club and the Photographic Society of Scotland. Founded in 1843 the club is one of the world&#x27;s first photographic clubs.

==Life==
Born on 24 July 1798, he was descended from the Napiers of Merchiston. His great-grandfather Francis Napier, 6th Lord Napier had five sons, of whom the youngest, Mark, a major-general in the army, was the grandfather of the biographer. His father was Francis Napier, a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, and his mother was Mary Elizabeth Jane Douglas, eldest daughter of Colonel Archibald Hamilton of Innerwick, Haddingtonshire. He was educated at Edinburgh High School and the university of Edinburgh, and passed advocate at the Scottish bar in 1820.

In the 1830s Mark Napier is listed as an advocate living at 11 Stafford Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s west end. 
In 1844 he was appointed sheriff-depute of Dumfriesshire, to which Galloway was subsequently added (in 1874), an office he held for the rest his life.

He died at his residence at 6 Ainslie Place on the Moray Estate in west Edinburgh, on 23 November 1879, as the oldest member of the Faculty of Advocates then discharging legal duties. He is buried in St Cuthberts churchyard in Edinburgh.

==Works==
Napier&#x27;s reputation was literary rather than legal: his only strictly legal works were &quot;The Law of Prescription in Scotland&quot;, 1839, 2nd edit. 1854, and &quot;Letters to the Commissioners of Supply of the County of Dumfries, in Reply to a Report of a Committee of their Number on the Subject of Sheriff Courts&quot;, 1852, 2nd edit. 1852.

In 1834 Napier published &quot;Memoirs&quot; of John Napier of Merchiston; and in 1839 he edited Napier&#x27;s unpublished manuscripts with an introduction. His other biographical works suffered from partisan exaggerations arising from his Jacobitism. On the Marquis of Montrose he published &quot;Montrose and the Covenanters&quot;, 1838, &quot;Life and Times of Montrose&quot;, 1840, &quot;Memorials of Montrose and his Times&quot;, a collection of original documents edited for the Maitland Club (vol. i. 1848, and vol. ii. 1850); and the summation in &quot;Memoirs of the Marquis of Montrose&quot;, two vols. 1856.

Napier&#x27;s &quot;Memorials of Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee&quot;, 1859–62, included letters of Claverhouse and other documents not previously available in print. The publication raised acrimonious controversy related to the execution by drowning of the two Covenanter women, Margaret Maclachlan and Margaret Wilson, who are still known as the &quot;Wigtown Martyrs&quot;, because Napier raised doubts as to whether the two women&#x27;s execution ever took place at all; and he replied to his objectors in the &quot;Case for the Crown in re the Wigtown Martyrs proved to be Myths versus Wodrow and Lord Macaulay, Patrick the Pedlar and Principal Tulloch&quot;, 1863; and in &quot;History Rescued, in Reply to History Vindicated&quot; (by the Rev. Archibald Stewart), 1870.

Napier in 1835 published a &quot;History of the Partition of Lennox&quot;; the Napiers had an historical connection with the earldom of Lennox. He also edited vols. ii. and iii. of John Spotiswood&#x27;s &quot;History of the Church of Scotland&quot; for the Bannatyne Club in 1847. &quot;The Lennox of Auld, an Epistolary Review of “The Lennox” by William Fraser&quot; was published posthumously in 1880, edited by his son Francis.

==Family==
Napier married his cousin Charlotte Ogilvy (1806-1883), daughter of Alexander Ogilvy, and widow of William Dick Macfarlane, and by her had a son and a daughter: Francis John Hamilton Scott, commander in the Royal Navy, and Frances Anne, married to Lieutenant-colonel Cecil Rice.

<text>John Neal (August 25, 1793 – June 20, 1876) was an American writer, critic, editor, lecturer, and activist. Considered both eccentric and influential, he delivered speeches and published essays, novels, poems, and short stories between the 1810s and 1870s in the United States and Great Britain, championing American literary nationalism and regionalism in their earliest stages. Neal advanced the development of American art, fought for women&#x27;s rights, advocated the end of slavery and racial prejudice, and helped establish the American gymnastics movement.

The first American author to use natural diction and a pioneer of colloquialism, Neal was the first to use the phrase &quot;son-of-a-bitch&quot; in a US work of fiction. He attained his greatest literary achievements between 1817 and 1835, during which time he was America&#x27;s first daily newspaper columnist, the first American published in British literary journals, author of the first history of American literature, America&#x27;s first art critic, a short story pioneer, a children&#x27;s literature pioneer, and a forerunner of the American Renaissance. As one of the first men to advocate women&#x27;s rights in the US and the first American lecturer on the issue, for over fifty years he supported female writers and organizers, affirmed intellectual equality between men and women, fought coverture laws against women&#x27;s economic rights, and demanded suffrage, equal pay, and better education for women. He was the first American to establish a public gymnasium in the US and championed athletics to regulate violent tendencies with which he himself had struggled throughout his life.

A largely self-educated man who attended no schools after the age of twelve, Neal was a child laborer who left self-employment in dry goods at twenty-two to pursue dual careers in law and literature. By middle age, Neal had attained comfortable wealth and community standing in his native Portland, Maine, through varied business investments, arts patronage, and civic leadership.

Neal is considered an author without a masterpiece, though his short stories are his highest literary achievements and ranked with the best of his age. &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; is considered his best novel, &quot;Otter-Bag, the Oneida Chief&quot; and &quot;David Whicher&quot; his best tales, and &quot;The Yankee&quot; his most influential periodical. His &quot;Rights of Women&quot; speech (1843) at the peak of his influence as a feminist had a considerable impact on the future of the movement.

==Biography==
===Childhood and early employment===
John Neal and his twin sister Rachel were born in the town of Portland in the Massachusetts District of Maine on August 25, 1793, the only children of John and Rachel Hall Neal. The senior John Neal, a school teacher, died a month later. Neal&#x27;s mother, described by former pupil Elizabeth Oakes Smith as a woman of &quot;clear intellect, and no little self-reliance and independence of will&quot;, made up the lost family income by establishing her own school and renting rooms in her home to boarders. She also received assistance from the siblings&#x27; unmarried uncle, James Neal, and others in their Quaker community. Neal grew up in &quot;genteel poverty&quot;, attending his mother&#x27;s school, a Quaker boarding school, and the public school in Portland. 

Neal claimed his lifelong struggle with a short temper and violent tendencies originated in the public school, at which he was bullied and physically abused by classmates and the schoolmaster. To reduce his mother&#x27;s financial burden, Neal left school and home at the age of twelve for full-time employment.
As an adolescent haberdasher and dry goods salesman in Portland and Portsmouth, Neal learned dishonest business practices like passing off counterfeit money and misrepresenting merchandise quality and quantity. Laid off multiple times due to business failures resulting from the 1806 Non-importation Act against British imports, Neal traveled through Maine as an itinerant penmanship instructor, watercolor teacher, and miniature portrait artist. At twenty years of age in 1814, he answered an ad for employment with a dry goods shop in Boston and moved to the larger city.

In Boston, Neal established a partnership with John Pierpont and Pierpont&#x27;s brother in-law, whereby they exploited supply chain constrictions caused by the War of 1812 to make quick profits smuggling contraband British dry goods between Boston, New York City, and Baltimore. They established stores in Boston, Baltimore, and Charleston before the recession following the war upended the firm and left Pierpont and Neal bankrupt in Baltimore in 1816. Though the &quot;Pierpont, Lord, and Neal&quot; wholesale/retail chain proved to be short-lived, Neal&#x27;s relationship with Pierpont grew into the closest and longest-lived friendship of his life.

Neal&#x27;s experience in business riding out the multiple booms and busts that eventually left him bankrupt at age twenty-two made him into a proud and ambitious young man who viewed reliance on his own talents and resources as the key to his recovery and future success.

===Building a career in Baltimore===
Neal&#x27;s time in Baltimore between his business failure in 1816 and his departure for London in 1823 was the busiest period of his life as he juggled overlapping careers in editorship, journalism, poetry, novels, law study, and later, law practice. During this period he taught himself to read and write in eleven languages, published seven books, read law for four years, completed an independent course of law study in eighteen months that was designed to be completed in seven-to-eight years, earned admission to the bar in a community known for rigorous requirements, and contributed prodigiously to newspapers and literary magazines, two of which he edited at different points.
Two months after Neal&#x27;s bankruptcy trial, he submitted his first contribution to &quot;The Portico&quot; and quickly became the magazine&#x27;s second-most prolific contributor of poems, essays, and literary criticism, though he was never paid. Two years later he took over as editor for what ended up being the last issue. The magazine was closely associated with the Delphian Club, which he founded in 1816 with Dr. Tobias Watkins, John Pierpont, and four other men. Neal felt indebted to this &quot;high-minded, generous, unselfish&quot; association of &quot;intellectual and companionable&quot; people for many of the happy memories and employment connections he enjoyed in Baltimore. While writing his earliest poetry, novels, and essays he was studying law as an unpaid apprentice in the office of William H. Winder, a fellow Delphian.

Neal&#x27;s business failure had left him without enough &quot;money to take a letter from the post-office&quot;, so Neal &quot;cast about for something better to do... and, after considering the matter for ten minutes or so, determined to try my hand at a novel.&quot; When he wrote his first book, fewer than seventy novels had been published by &quot;not more than half a dozen [American] authors; and of these, only Washington Irving had received more than enough to pay for the salt in his porridge.&quot; Neal was nevertheless inspired by Pierpont&#x27;s financial success with his poem &quot;The Airs of Palestine&quot; (1816) and encouraged by the reception of his initial submissions to &quot;The Portico&quot;. He resolved that &quot;there was nothing left for me but authorship, or starvation, if I persisted in my plan of studying law&quot;.

Composing his first and only bound volume of poetry was Neal&#x27;s nighttime distraction from laboring sixteen hours a day, seven days a week, for more than four months to produce an index for six years of weekly publications of Hezekiah Niles&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Register&quot; magazine, which Niles admitted was &quot;the most laborious work of the kind that ever appeared in any country&quot;. 

In 1819, he published a play and took his first paying job as a newspaper editor, becoming the country&#x27;s first daily columnist. The same year he wrote three-quarters of &quot;History of the American Revolution&quot;, otherwise credited to Paul Allen. Neal&#x27;s substantial literary output earned him the moniker from his Delphian Club associates. By these means he was able to pay his expenses while completing his apprenticeship and independently studying law. He was admitted to the bar and started practicing law in Baltimore in 1820.

Neal&#x27;s final years in Baltimore were his most productive as a novelist. He published one novel in 1822 and three more the following year, eventually rising to the status of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s chief rival for recognition as America&#x27;s leading novelist. In this turbulent period he quit the Delphian Club on bad terms and accepted excommunication from the Society of Friends after his participation in a street brawl. In reaction to insults against prominent lawyer William Pinkney published in &quot;Randolph&quot; just after Pinkney died, his son Edward Coote Pinkney challenged Neal to a duel. Having established himself six years earlier as an outspoken opponent of dueling, Neal refused and the two engaged in a battle of printed words in the fall of that year. Neal became &quot;weary of the law—weary as death&quot;, feeling that he spent those years in &quot;open war, with the whole tribe of lawyers in America&quot;. &quot;Ironically... at precisely the moment when [Neal] was endeavoring to establish himself as &quot;the&quot; American writer, Neal was also alienating friends, critics, and the general public at an alarming rate.&quot;

By late 1823, Neal was ready to relocate away from Baltimore. According to him, the catalyst to move to London was a dinner party with an English friend who quoted Sydney Smith&#x27;s 1820 then-notorious remark, &quot;in the four quarters of the globe, who reads an American book?&quot;. Whether it had more to do with Smith or Pinkney, Neal took less than a month after that dinner date to settle his affairs in Baltimore and secure passage on a ship bound for the UK on December 15, 1823.

===Writing in London===

Neal&#x27;s relocation to London figured into three professional goals that guided him through the 1820s: to supplant Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper as the leading American literary voice, to bring about a new distinctly American literary style, and to reverse the British literary establishment&#x27;s disdain for American writers. He followed Irving&#x27;s precedent of using temporary residence in London to earn more money and notoriety from the British literary market. London publishers had already pirated &quot;Seventy-Six&quot; and &quot;Logan&quot;, but Neal hoped those companies would pay him to publish &quot;Errata&quot; and &quot;Randolph&quot; if he were present to negotiate. They refused.

Neal brought enough money to survive for only a few months on the assumption that &quot;if people gave any thing for books here, they would not be able to starve me, since I could live upon air, and write faster than any man that ever lived.&quot; His financial situation had become desperate when William Blackwood asked Neal in April 1824 to become a regular contributor to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. For the next year and a half, Neal was &quot;handsomely paid&quot; to be one of the magazine&#x27;s most prolific contributors.

His first &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; article, a profile on the 1824 candidates for US president and the five presidents who had served to that point, was the first article by an American to appear in a British literary journal and was quoted and republished widely throughout Europe. As the first written history of American literature, the &quot;American Writers&quot; series was Neal&#x27;s most noteworthy contribution to the magazine. Blackwood provided the platform for Neal&#x27;s earliest written works on gender and women&#x27;s rights and published &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;, but a back-and-forth over manuscript revisions in autumn 1825 soured the relationship and Neal was once again without a source of income.

After a short time earning much less money writing articles for other British periodicals, thirty-two year-old John Neal met seventy-seven year-old utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham through the London Debating Societies. In late 1825 Bentham offered him rooms at his &quot;Hermitage&quot; and a position as his personal secretary. Neal spent the next year and a half writing for Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Westminster Review&quot;.

In spring 1827, Bentham financed Neal&#x27;s return to the US. He left the UK having caught the attention of the British literary elite, published the novel he brought with him, and &quot;succeeded to perfection&quot; in educating the British about American institutions, habits, and prospects. Yet &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; was not received as the great American novel and it failed to earn Neal the level of international fame he had hoped for, so he returned to the US no longer Cooper&#x27;s chief rival.

===Return to Portland, Maine===
Neal returned to the United States from Europe in June 1827 with plans to settle in New York City, but stopped first in his native Portland to visit his mother and sister. There he was confronted by citizens offended by his derision of prominent citizens in the semi-autobiographical &quot;Errata&quot;, the way he depicted New England dialect and habits in &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;, and his criticism of American writers in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Residents posted broadsides, engaged in verbally and physically violent exchanges with Neal in the streets, and conspired to block his admission to the bar. Neal defiantly resolved to settle in Portland instead of New York. Verily, verily,&#x27; said I, &#x27;if they take that position, here I will stay, till I am both rooted and grounded—grounded in the graveyard, if nowhere else.
Neal became a proponent in the US of athletics he had practiced abroad, including Friedrich Jahn&#x27;s early Turnen gymnastics and boxing and fencing techniques he learned in Paris, London, and Baltimore. He opened Maine&#x27;s first gymnasium in 1827, making him the first American to establish a public gym in the US. He offered lessons in boxing and fencing in his law office. The same year he started gyms in nearby Saco and at Bowdoin College. The year before he had published articles on German gymnastics in the &quot;American Journal of Education&quot; and urged Thomas Jefferson to include a gymnastics school at the University of Virginia. Neal&#x27;s athletic pursuits modeled &quot;a new sense of maleness&quot; that favored &quot;forbearance based on strength&quot; and helped him regulate the violent tendencies with which he struggled throughout his life.

In 1828, Neal established &quot;The Yankee&quot; magazine with himself as editor, and continued publication through the end of 1829. He used its pages to vindicate himself to fellow Portlanders, critique American art and drama, host a discourse on the nature of New Englander identity, advance his developing feminist ideas, and encourage new literary voices, most of them women. Neal also edited many other periodicals between the late 1820s and the mid 1840s and was during this time a highly sought-after contributor on a variety of topics.

Neal published three novels from material he produced in London and focused his new creative writing efforts on a body of short stories that represents his greatest literary achievement. Neal published an average of one tale per year between 1828 and 1846, helping to shape the relatively new short story genre. He began traveling as a lecturer in 1829, reaching the height of his influence in the women&#x27;s rights movement in 1843 when he was delivering speeches before large crowds in New York City and reaching wider audiences through the press. This period of juggling literary, activist, athletic, legal, artistic, social, and business pursuits was captured by Neal&#x27;s law apprentice James Brooks in 1833:
Neal was... a boxing-master, and fencing-master too, and as a printer&#x27;s devil came in, crying &quot;copy, more copy,&quot; he would race with a huge swan&#x27;s quill, full gallop, over sheets of paper as with a steam-pen, and off went one page, and off went another, and then a lesson in boxing, the thump of glove to glove, then the mask, and the stamp of the sandal, and the ringing of the foils.
===Family and civic leadership===

In 1828, Neal married his second cousin Eleanor Hall and together they had five children between 1829 and 1847. The couple raised their children in the house he built on Portland&#x27;s prestigious State Street in 1836. Also in 1836 he received an honorary master&#x27;s degree from Bowdoin College, the same institution at which Neal made a living as a self-employed teenage penmanship instructor and that later educated the more economically privileged Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

After the 1830s, Neal became less active in literary circles and increasingly occupied with business, activism, and local arts and civic projects, particularly after receiving inheritances from two paternal uncles that dramatically reduced his need to rely on writing as a source of income. James Neal died in 1832 and Stephen Neal in 1836, but the second inheritance was held up until 1858 in a legal battle involving Stephen&#x27;s daughter, suffragist Lydia Neal Dennett. In 1845 he became the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company&#x27;s first agent in Maine, earning enough in commissions that he decided to retire from the lecture circuit, law practice, and most writing projects. Neal began developing and managing local real estate, operating multiple granite quarries, developing railroad connections to Portland, and investing in land speculation in Cairo, Illinois. He led the movement to incorporate Portland as a city and build the community&#x27;s first parks and sidewalks. He became interested in architecture, interior design, and furniture design, developing pioneering, simple, and functional solutions that influenced other designers outside his local area.

Many of his literary contemporaries interpreted Neal&#x27;s change in focus as a disappearance. Hawthorne wrote in 1845 of &quot;that wild fellow, John Neal&quot;, who &quot;surely has long been dead, else he never could keep himself so quiet.&quot; James Russell Lowell in 1848 claimed he had &quot;wasted in Maine the sinews and cords of his pugilist brain&quot;. Friend and fellow Portland native Henry Wadsworth Longfellow described Neal in 1860 as &quot;a good deal tempered down but fire enough still&quot;.

After years of vaguely affiliating with Unitarianism and universalism, Neal converted to Congregationalism in 1851. Through deepened religiosity he found new moral arguments for women&#x27;s rights, potential release from his violent tendencies, and inspiration for seven religious essays. Neal collected these &quot;exhortations&quot; in &quot;One Word More&quot; (1854), which &quot;rambles passionately for two hundred pages and closes with breathless metaphor&quot; in an effort to convert &quot;the reasoning and thoughtful among believers&quot;.

At the urging of Longfellow and other friends, John Neal returned to novel writing late in life, publishing &quot;True Womanhood&quot; in 1859. To fill a gap in his income between 1863 and 1866 he wrote three dime novels. In 1869 he published his &quot;most readable book, and certainly one of the most entertaining autobiographies to come out of nineteenth-century America&quot;. Reflecting on his life this way inspired Neal to amplify his activism and assume regional leadership roles in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. His last two books are a collection of pieces for and about children titled &quot;Great Mysteries and Little Plagues&quot; (1870), and a guidebook for his hometown titled &quot;Portland Illustrated&quot; (1874).
By 1870, in his old age, he had amassed a comfortable fortune, valued at $80,000. His last appearance in the public eye was likely an 1875 syndicated article from the &quot;Portland Advertiser&quot; about an eighty-one year-old Neal physically overpowering a man in his early twenties who was smoking on a non-smoking streetcar. John Neal died on June 20, 1876, and was buried in the Neal family plot in Portland&#x27;s Western Cemetery.

==Writing==
Neal&#x27;s body of literary work spans almost sixty years from the end of the War of 1812 to a decade following the Civil War, though he achieved his major literary accomplishments between 1817 and 1835. His writing both reflects and challenges shifting American ways of life over those years. He started his career as an American reading public was just beginning to emerge, working immediately and consistently within the nation&#x27;s developing &quot;complex web of print culture&quot;. Throughout his adult life, especially in the 1830s, Neal was a prolific contributor to newspapers and magazines, writing essays on a wide variety of topics including but not limited to art criticism, literary criticism, phrenology, women&#x27;s rights, early German gymnastics, and slavery. 

His efforts to subvert the influence of the British literary elite and to develop a rival American literature were largely credited to his successors until more recent twenty-first century scholarship shifted that credit to Neal. His short stories are &quot;his highest literary achievement&quot; and are ranked with those of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, and Rudyard Kipling. John Neal is often considered an influential American literary figure with no masterpiece of his own.

===Style===

Defying the rigid moralism and sentimentality of his American contemporaries Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, Neal&#x27;s early novels between the late 1810s and 1820s depict dark, physically-flawed, conflicted Byronesque heroes of great intellect and morals. His brand of Romanticism reflected an aversion for self-criticism and revision, relying instead on &quot;nearly automatic writing&quot; to define his style, enhance the commercial viability of his works, and craft a new American literature. As a pioneer of &quot;talk[ing] on paper&quot; or &quot;natural writing&quot;, Neal was &quot;the first in America to be natural in his diction&quot; and his work represents &quot;the first deviation from... Irvingesque graciousness&quot; in which &quot;not only characters but also genres converse, and are interrogated, challenged, and transformed.&quot; Neal declared that he &quot;never shall write what is now worshipped under the name of &quot;classical&quot; English&quot;, which was &quot;the deadest language I ever met with or heard of&quot;.

Neal&#x27;s voice was one of many following the War of 1812 calling for an American literary nationalism, but Neal felt his colleagues&#x27; work relied too much on British conventions. By contrast, he felt that &quot;to succeed..., I must be unlike all that have gone before me&quot; and issue &quot;another Declaration of Independence, in the great &quot;Republic of Letters&quot;.&quot; To achieve this he exploited distinctly American characters, settings, historical events, and manners of speech in his writing. This was a &quot;caustic assault&quot; on British literary elites viewed as aristocrats writing for personal amusement, in contrast to American authors as middle class professionals plying a commercial trade for sustenance. By mimicking the common and sometimes profane language of his countrymen in fiction, Neal hoped to appeal to a broader readership of minimally educated book buyers, thereby intending to guarantee the existence of an American national literature by ensuring its economic viability.

Starting in the late 1820s, Neal shifted his focus from nationalism to regionalism to challenge the rise of Jacksonianism in the US by showcasing and contrasting coexisting regional and multicultural differences within the United States. The collection of essays and stories he published in his magazine &quot;The Yankee&quot; &quot;lays the groundwork for reading the nation itself as a collection of voices in conversation&quot; and &quot;asks readers to decide for themselves how to manage the multiple and contending sides of a federal union.&quot; To preserve variations in American English he feared might disappear in an increasingly nationalist climate, he became one of the first writers to employ colloquialism and regional dialects in his writing.

===Literary criticism===
Neal used literary criticism in magazines and novels to encourage desired changes in the field and to uplift new writers, most of them women. Noted for his &quot;critical vision&quot;, Neal expressed judgments that were widely accepted in his lifetime. &quot;My opinion of other [people&#x27;s] writings&quot;, he said, &quot;has never been ill received; and in every case... my judgment has been confirmed, sooner or later, without a single exception.&quot; Fred Lewis Pattee corroborated this statement seventy years after Neal&#x27;s death: &quot;Where he condemned, time has almost without exception condemned also.&quot;

As an American literary nationalist, he called for &quot;faithful representations of native character&quot; in literature that utilize the &quot;abundant and hidden sources of fertility... in the northern, as well as the southern Americas&quot;. His &quot;American Writers&quot; essay series in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (1824) is the earliest written history of American literature, and was reprinted as a collection in 1937. Neal dismissed almost all of the 120 authors he critiqued in that series as derivative of their British predecessors.
John Neal used his role as critic, particularly in the pages of his magazine &quot;The Yankee&quot;, to draw attention to newer writers in whose work he saw promise. John Greenleaf Whittier, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow all received their first &quot;substantial sponsorship or praise&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s pages. When submitting poetry to Neal for review, Whittier made the request, &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, say so privately; and &quot;I will quit poetry, and everything also of a literary nature&quot;&quot;.

Poe was Neal&#x27;s most historically impactful discovery and when he quit poetry for short stories it was likely due to Neal&#x27;s influence. Poe thanked Neal for &quot;the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard&quot;. After Poe&#x27;s death two decades later, Neal defended his legacy against attacks in Rufus Wilmot Griswold&#x27;s unsympathetic obituary of Poe, labeling Griswold &quot;a Rhadamanthus, who is not to be bilked of his fee, a thimble-full of newspaper notoriety&quot;.

===Short stories===
Called &quot;the inventor of the American short story&quot;, Neal&#x27;s tales are &quot;his highest literary achievement&quot;. He published an average of one per year between 1828 and 1846, helping to shape the relatively new short story genre, particularly early children&#x27;s literature.

Considered his best short stories, &quot;Otter-Bag, the Oneida Chief&quot; (1829) and &quot;David Whicher&quot; (1832) &quot;overshadow the less inspired efforts of his more famous contemporaries and add a dimension to the art of storytelling not to be found in Irving and Poe, rarely in Hawthorne, and rarely in American fiction until Melville and Twain decades later (and Faulkner a century later) began telling their tales.&quot; Ironically, &quot;David Whicher&quot; was published anonymously and not attributed to Neal until the 1960s. &quot;The Haunted Man&quot; (1832) is noteworthy as the first work of fiction to utilize psychotherapy. &quot;The Old Pussy-Cat and the Two Little Pussy-Cats&quot; and &quot;The Life and Adventures of Tom Pop&quot; (1835) are both considered pioneering works of children&#x27;s literature.

Like his magazine essays and lectures, Neal&#x27;s stories challenged American socio-political phenomena that grew in the period leading up to and including Andrew Jackson&#x27;s terms as US president (1829–1837): manifest destiny, empire building, Indian removal, consolidation of federal power, racialized citizenship, and the Cult of Domesticity. &quot;David Whicher&quot; challenged a body of popular literature that converged in the 1820s around a &quot;divisive and destructive insistence on frontiersman and the Indian as implacable enemies&quot;. &quot;Idiosyncrasies&quot; is a &quot;manifesto for human rights&quot; in the face of &quot;hegemonic patriarchalism&quot;. His stories in this period also used humor and satire to address social and political phenomena, most notably &quot;Courtship&quot; (1829), &quot;The Utilitarian&quot; (1830), &quot;The Young Phrenologist&quot; (1836), &quot;Animal Magnetism&quot; (1839), and &quot;The Ins and the Outs&quot; (1841).

===Novels===
With the exception of &quot;True Womanhood&quot; (1859), John Neal published all of his novels between 1817 and 1833. The first five he wrote and published in Baltimore: &quot;Keep Cool&quot; (1817), &quot;Logan&quot; (1822), &quot;Seventy-Six&quot; (1823), &quot;Randolph&quot; (1823), and &quot;Errata&quot; (1823). He wrote &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; in Baltimore, but revised and published it in London in 1825. He published &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; (1828), &quot;Authorship&quot; (1830), and &quot;The Down-Easters&quot; (1833) while living in Portland, Maine, but all are reworkings of content he wrote in London.

&quot;Keep Cool&quot;, Neal&#x27;s first novel, made him &quot;the first in America to be natural in his diction&quot; and the &quot;father of American subversive fiction&quot;. Generally regarded as a failure, the book shows that &quot;the gulf between Neal&#x27;s prophetic vision of a native literature and his own capacity to fulfill that vision is painfully apparent&quot;. The productivity of Neal&#x27;s Baltimore days is &quot;hard to believe—until one reads the novels&quot; and notices the haste with which they were written.

&quot;Logan, a Family History&quot; is a &quot;gothic tapestry&quot; of &quot;superstition, supernatural suggestions, brutality, sensuality, colossal hatred, delirium, rape, insanity, murder... incest and cannibalism&quot;. By &quot;elevating emotional effect over coherence, the novel excites its readers to death.&quot; It challenged the national narrative of American Indians&#x27; foreordained disappearance in the face of White Americans&#x27; territorial expansion and collapsed racial boundaries between the two groups.

&quot;Seventy-Six&quot; was Neal&#x27;s favorite of his novels. When it was released in 1823, Neal was at the height of his prominence as a novelist, being at the time the chief rival of leading American author, James Fenimore Cooper. Inspired by Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Spy&quot;, Neal based his story on historical research compiled a few years earlier while helping his friend Paul Allen write his &quot;History of the American Revolution&quot;. &quot;Seventy-Six&quot; was criticized at the time for its use of profanity and was recognized later as the first work of American fiction to use the phrase &quot;son-of-a-bitch&quot;.

&quot;Brother Jonathan: or, the New Englanders&quot; was the most &quot;complex, ambitious, and demanding&quot; American novel until Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Littlepage Manuscripts&quot; trilogy twenty years later. As &quot;one of the most emphatic, even shrill examples of U.S. nationalistic literature&quot;, it is &quot;positively bristling with regional accents, from the New England twang of its protagonists through to bursts of patois in Virginian, Georgian, Scottish, Penobscot Indian, and Ebonics&quot;. Running counter to Neal&#x27;s purported nationalist theme, &quot;the diverse linguistic styles&quot; used in the novel &quot;subvert the fiction of a unified, national whole&quot; in the US. The novel&#x27;s &quot;greatest achievement [is] its faithful if irreverent representation of American customs and American speech&quot; that nevertheless &quot;was read by American reviewers as outright slander&quot; against the US and &quot;aroused a terrible storm... in Portland [where] he was denounced with great indignation.&quot;

&quot;Rachel Dyer: a North American Story&quot; (1828) is widely considered to be John Neal&#x27;s most successful novel, most readable for a modern audience, and most successful at manifesting his desire for a national American literature. Along with &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; and &quot;The Down-Easters&quot;, it is notable for depicting peculiar American folkways, accents, and slang. One hundred years later it provided source material for the &quot;Dictionary of American English&quot;. A historical fiction like many of Neal&#x27;s other novels, it is the first hardcover novel based on the Salem witch trials and influenced John Greenleaf Whittier and Nathaniel Hawthorne to include witchcraft in their creative writing.

===Art criticism and patronage===
Neal was the first American art critic, though he did not receive this recognition until the twentieth century. Scholar William David Barry argued that Neal&#x27;s impact in this field may be superior to his role in fiction. Starting in 1819 with articles in Baltimore newspapers, Neal expanded to a much wider audience with &quot;Randolph&quot; (1823), which communicated his opinions through the thin veil of the novel&#x27;s protagonist. Though he continued work in this field at least as late 1869, his chief impact was in the 1820s. Neal around this time regularly visited Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s Peale Museum, courted his daughter Rosalba Carriera Peale, and sat for portraits with his niece Sarah Miriam Peale.

Neal&#x27;s approach to art criticism in the early 1820s was intuitive and showed disdain for connoisseurship, which he viewed as aristocratic and incompatible with American democratic ideals. Neal shows some initial influence from August Wilhelm Schlegel&#x27;s &quot;Course of Lectures in Dramatic Art and Literature&quot; and Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;Discourses&quot;, but largely broke with those sensibilities over the course of the decade. By the late 1820s he came to dismiss history painting and show preference for &quot;the unadulterated truth of the American locality and nature&quot; he found in portraits and landscapes, anticipating the rise of the Hudson River School. The positive attention Neal paid to American portrait painters trained in the &quot;humbler contingencies&quot; of sign painting and applied arts was accompanied by his acknowledgment of the artist&#x27;s often conflicting priorities: preserving likeness of the subject without offending the customer. Neal was also unique in his effort in this period to raise the status of engraving as fine art, paying particular attention to engraved paintings published in &quot;The Token&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic Souvenir&quot; annual gift books.

Reynolds&#x27;s approach to art criticism would remain dominant in both the US and UK until John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Painters&quot; was published in 1843, though Neal&#x27;s &quot;Landscape and Portrait-Painting&quot; (1829) anticipated many of those Ruskinesque changes by distinguishing between &quot;things seen by the artist&quot; and &quot;things as they are&quot;.

After Neal had accumulated sufficient wealth and influence toward the middle of the nineteenth century, he began patronizing and uplifting artists in the Portland, Maine area. Painter Charles Codman and sculptor Benjamin Paul Akers both became steadily patronized as a result of Neal&#x27;s encouragement, patronage, and connections. Neal also helped guide the work and careers of Franklin Simmons, John Rollin Tilton, and Harrison Bird Brown. Brown became Portland&#x27;s most successful artist of the nineteenth century.

Comparatively constant is Neal&#x27;s taste for bold, unlabored approaches to painting that utilize &quot;an offhand, free, sketchy style, without high finish&quot;. The same could be said of Neal&#x27;s &quot;fantastic mixture of common sense and absurdity, of intelligent observation and dross&quot; that portrays Neal the art critic as &quot;melodramatic, addicted to exaggeration, superficial, inconsistent, ill-informed, naive&quot;. These descriptors apply less to his final essays on art (1868 and 1869) that conspicuously lack the qualities of Neal&#x27;s boastful, confident, and passionate style in the 1820s. His opinions from that earlier period &quot;to a remarkable degree... have stood the trying test of time.&quot;

===Poetry===
The bulk of Neal&#x27;s poetry was published in &quot;The Portico&quot; while studying law in Baltimore. His only bound collection of poems is &quot;Battle of Niagara, A Poem, without Notes; and Goldau, or the Maniac Harper&quot;, published in 1818. Though &quot;Battle of Niagara&quot; brought him little fame or money, it is considered the best poetic description of Niagara Falls up to that time. Poems by Neal are also featured in &quot;Specimens of American Poetry&quot; edited by Samuel Kettell (1829), &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot; edited by Rufus Wilmot Griswold (1850), and &quot;American Poetry from the Beginning to Whitman&quot; edited by Louis Untermeyer (1931). Griswold considered Neal one of the best poets of his age.

===Drama and theatrical criticism===
Neal authored two plays, neither of which were ever produced on stage: &quot;Otho: A Tragedy, in Five Acts&quot; (1819) and &quot;Our Ephraim, or The New Englanders, A What-d&#x27;ye-call-it?—in three Acts&quot; (1835).

Neal wrote &quot;Otho&quot; hoping it would see production with Thomas Abthorpe Cooper in the lead, but Cooper showed no interest. The play was written in verse and heavily inspired by the works of Lord Byron; John Pierpont considered it too dense and wrote to Neal that it needed &quot;a sky-light or two&quot; cut into it. It was also described as &quot;at once both mystifying and trite&quot;. Neal brought the script with him to London with plans to revise it and have it produced for the stage while he was there, but he never achieved that goal.
&quot;Our Ephraim&quot; was commissioned in 1834 by actor James Henry Hackett, who asked Neal to &quot;squat right down &amp; in your ready style in two or three days conjure me together something &#x27;curious nice. Hackett rejected the play upon receipt as unsuitable for production: too many roles requiring a rural Maine accent, unrealistic set requirements, and too much scheduled improvisation. The play nevertheless represents &quot;a significant advance in early American theatrical realism&quot; and is the &quot;fullest detailing of Yankee dialect&quot; of any work Neal produced.

Neal&#x27;s most noteworthy work of theatrical criticism is his five-installment essay &quot;The Drama&quot; (1829). Condemning stilted dialogue, Neal contended that &quot;when a person talks beautifully in his sorrow, it shows both great preparation and insincerity&quot; and urged that playwrights should, &quot;avoid poetry whenever the characters are much in earnest.&quot; Sixty years later William Dean Howells was considered innovative for saying the same thing.

==Editing==
Neal found his first two positions as editor through fellow members of the Delphian Club in Baltimore. His longest stint as editor was for &quot;The Yankee&quot;, which he founded only a few months after returning from London in 1827. Maine&#x27;s first literary periodical, it ran weekly until, for financial reasons, it merged with a Boston magazine and was renamed &quot;The Yankee and Boston Literary Gazette&quot; as a monthly publication. It merged with &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot; when it ceased publication at the end of 1829. When starting his last stint as editor, he declared, &quot;Having ten or fifteen minutes to spare, we have made up our minds to edit a newspaper.&quot; After Neal left in a huff few weeks later, the next editor announced, &quot;John Neal has retired from the editorship of the &quot;Transcript&quot;, the fifteen minutes having expired.&quot;

Despite professing allegiance to Benthamian Utilitarianism in &quot;The Yankee&quot;, Neal dedicated much more space in its pages to reinforcing Northern New England&#x27;s standing on the national stage and championing American regionalism. His regionalism was distinct from those later in the century &quot;who tended to portray regional spaces in nostalgic or sentimental terms as &#x27;enclaves of tradition&#x27; that were posed against an increasingly urban and industrial nation.&quot; Instead, &quot;Neal remained committed to imagining regions as dynamic, future-oriented spaces whose identities would—and should—remain elusive.&quot;

Controversial at the time for its lack of association with any political party or other interest group, &quot;The Yankee&quot; was free to cover &quot;every thing from church to state, from the tallest tome, no matter how thick, down to the smallest affairs, of tokens and souvenirs and lady-actress&#x27;s feet—of poets and dogs, of paintings and side-walks, of Bentham and Jeffrey, and sleigh-rides and huskings, of politics and religion, and &#x27;courting&#x27; and &#x27;blackberrying. The magazine&#x27;s greatest impact on literature was uplifting new voices like John Greenleaf Whittier, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Elizabeth Oakes Smith, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Most of the new writers whose works he published and wrote about in &quot;The Yankee&quot; were women.

==Lecturing==

Between 1829 and 1848, Neal supplemented his income as a lecturer. Traveling on the lyceum movement circuit, he covered topics such as &quot;literature, eloquence, the fine arts, political economy, temperance, poets and poetry, public-speaking, our pilgrim-fathers, colonization, law and lawyers, the study of languages, natural-history, phrenology, women&#x27;s-rights, self-education, self-reliance, and self-distrust, progress of opinion, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&quot;.

When asked without notice to address the theme of freedom in Portland, Maine, on Independence Day 1832, Neal accepted and gave an unprepared speech that was his first on women&#x27;s rights. He used the principles of the American Revolution to attack slavery as an affront to liberty, and female disfranchisement and coverture as taxation without representation. Women&#x27;s rights became a favorite topic of his frequent lecture engagements between 1832 and 1843 throughout the northeastern states. As they were almost always published afterward and often covered in newspaper reviews, these events broadened Neal&#x27;s sphere of influence and made his ideas accessible to readers not necessarily aligned with his views. Margaret Fuller admired Neal&#x27;s &quot;magnetic genius&quot;, &quot;lion heart&quot;, and &quot;sense of the ludicrous&quot; as a lecturer, though she poked fun at his &quot;exaggeration and coxcombry&quot;. His most well-attended and influential address was the 1843 &quot;Rights of Women&quot; speech at New York City&#x27;s largest auditorium at the time, the Broadway Tabernacle.

==Activism==
Using magazine and newspaper articles, short stories, novels, lectures, political organizing, and personal relationships, Neal throughout his adult life addressed issues including feminism, women&#x27;s rights, slavery, rights of free Black Americans, rights of American Indians, dueling, temperance, lotteries, capital punishment, militia tax, insolvency law, and social hierarchy. Of these, &quot;women&#x27;s rights were the cause for which he fought longer and more consistently than for any other.&quot; Much of Neal&#x27;s writing and lecturing on these topics demonstrated &quot;a basic distrust of institutions and a continuing plea for self-examination and self-reliance&quot;.

Additionally, Neal was heavily involved in William Henry Harrison&#x27;s 1840 presidential campaign, which almost resulted in his appointment as a district attorney. He also promoted the pseudoscience movements phrenology, animal magnetism, spiritualism, and clairvoyance.

===Feminism===
Neal was America&#x27;s first women&#x27;s rights lecturer and one of the first male advocates of women&#x27;s rights and feminist causes in the US. At least as early as 1817 and late as 1873, he used journalism, fiction, lectures, political organizing, and personal relationships to advance feminist issues in the US and UK, reaching the height of his influence in this field around 1843. Neal supported female writers and organizers, affirmed intellectual equality between men and women, fought coverture laws against women&#x27;s economic rights, and demanded suffrage, equal pay, and better education for women.

Neal&#x27;s early focus on female education was primarily influenced by Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; as well as works by Catharine Macaulay and Judith Sargent Murray. His early feminist essays from the 1820s fill an intellectual gap between eighteenth-century feminists and their pre-Seneca Falls Convention successors Sarah Moore Grimké, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Margaret Fuller. As a male writer insulated from many forms of attack leveled against earlier female feminist thinkers, Neal&#x27;s advocacy was crucial to bringing the field back into published discourse in the US and UK after a lull at the turn of the century.

From the &quot;feminist undertones&quot; in his first novel (1817) through the illustrations of &quot;patriarchal cruelty&quot; in &quot;Errata&quot; (1823) and &quot;Idiosyncrasies&quot; (1843) to the vindication of independent, unmarried women in &quot;True Womanhood&quot; (1859), Neal broke with writers of his generation by consciously and consistently including women and women&#x27;s issues throughout his career as a writer of fiction. &quot;Idiosyncrasies&quot; explored the male feminist perspective through the character Lee who said, &quot;we men... imprison the soul of woman, and set a seal upon her faculties—... allowing her no share whatever in... governing ourselves: Having found the cause... and believing in my heart... that where the evil was, there the remedy must be sought for, I went to work&quot;.

&quot;Men and Women&quot; (1824), his first feminist essay, recalls the eighteenth-century priority of female education: &quot;Wait until women are educated like men—treated like men—and permitted to talk freely, without being put to shame, &quot;because&quot; they are women&quot;. At that future time, he posited that the greatest of male writers &quot;will be &quot;equalled&quot; by women&quot;. Going further than his predecessors on intellectual equality, he &quot;maintain[ed] that women are not &quot;inferior&quot; to men, but only &quot;unlike&quot; men, in their intellectual properties&quot; and &quot;would have women treated like men, of common sense.&quot; The article more fully explores the concept he raised in &quot;Essay on Duelling&quot; (1817), in which when he urged women to use &quot;the &quot;reason&quot; that Heaven has apportioned so equally between her, and her brother&quot; to rid the world of duels.

Over the 1820s, Neal shifted his focus from educational and intellectual ideas to political and economic issues like coverture and suffrage. In an 1845 letter to activist Margaret Fuller, he said
I tell you there is no hope for woman, till she has a hand in making the law—no chance for her till her vote is worth as much as a mans vote. When it is—woman will not be fobbed off with a six-pence a day for the very work a man would get a dollar for... All you and others are doing to elevate woman, is only fitted to make her feel more sensibly the long abuse of her own understanding, when she comes to her senses. You might as well educate slaves—and still keep them in bondage.

Neal delivered America&#x27;s first women&#x27;s rights lecture as an Independence Day address in Portland, Maine in 1832. He declared that under coverture and without suffrage, women were victims of the same crime of taxation without representation that caused the Revolutionary War. He reached the peak of his influence on feminist issues at the time of his &quot;Rights of Women&quot; speech (1843) before a crowd of 3,000 people in New York City. He attacked the concept of virtual representation in government that suffrage opponents argued women could enjoy through men: &quot;Just reverse the condition of the two sexes: give to Women all the power now enjoyed by Men... What a clamour there would be then, about &quot;equal rights&quot;, about a &quot;privileged class&quot;, about being &quot;taxed without their own consent&quot;, and &quot;virtual representation&quot;, and all that!&quot;

The &quot;Rights of Women&quot; speech was widely covered, albeit dismissed, by the press, and Neal printed it later that year in the pages of &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; magazine, of which he was editor. He used that magazine in 1843 to publish his own essays calling for equal pay and better workplace conditions for women, and to host a printed debate of correspondence on the merits of women&#x27;s suffrage between himself and Eliza W. Farnham. Looking back more than forty years later, the second volume of the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; (1887) remembered that the lecture &quot;roused considerable discussion..., was extensively copied, and... had a wide, silent influence, preparing the way for action. It was a scathing satire, and men felt the rebuke.&quot;

For twenty years following his work with &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; magazine, Neal wrote about women almost exclusively in fiction but only occasionally about feminist issues in periodicals. He mused about crossdressing and the performative nature of gender in &quot;Masquerading&quot; (1864), &quot;one of the most interesting essays of his career&quot;. He followed this with two women&#x27;s rights essays for the &quot;American Phrenological Journal&quot; (1867), the women&#x27;s rights chapter of his autobiography (1869), and twelve articles in &quot;The Revolution&quot; (1868–1870).

Neal became prominently involved as an organizer in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement following the Civil War, finding influence in local, regional, and national organizations. When the American Equal Rights Association split in 1869 over the Fifteenth Amendment, Neal regretted the division of efforts, but lent his support to the subsequent National Woman Suffrage Association because of its insistence upon immediate suffrage for all women. He cofounded the New England Woman Suffrage Association in 1868, organized Portland&#x27;s first public meeting on women&#x27;s suffrage in 1870, and cofounded Maine&#x27;s first statewide Woman Suffrage Association in 1873.

===Slavery===
Neal was &quot;resolutely and heartily opposed to slavery&quot;, interpreting the ideals of the Declaration of Independence to mean that &quot;the slaves in America were created free... Ergo—They may abolish the government, which, by keeping them as they are kept, has &#x27;violated its trust. In reaction to widespread rape of enslaved women, he reported that &quot;white fathers... are guilty of selling their own flesh and blood to bondage... In the Southern States of America, where coloured women are sought after, purchased, and cohabited with by white men... because the profit of the master is in direct proportion to the fruitfulness of the slave.&quot;

Believing that &quot;sudden emancipation of the whole [enslaved population], at once, is impossible&quot; and that it would perpetuate Black Americans&#x27; status as &quot;a much-to-be-dreaded caste&quot; in the US, he supported &quot;gradual emancipation [which] has done well in the New England states; and in New York.&quot; Because New England had &quot;nothing to lose by emancipation; but rather...much to gain by it; since the value of white labour would rise&quot;, Neal called for federally-funded compensated emancipation to spread the cost throughout the states.

Neal supported the American Colonization Society, founding the Portland, Maine local chapter in 1833, serving as its secretary, and later meeting with Liberia&#x27;s first president, Joseph Jenkins Roberts. Neal likely avoided the movement for &quot;immediate, unconditional, and universal emancipation&quot; because of a long-standing feud with William Lloyd Garrison. The feud was not resolved until Neal declared in 1865 that &quot;I was wrong... and Mr. Garrison was right.&quot;

===Rights of Black Americans===
Neal protested disfranchisement of free Black Americans by revealing how &quot;&quot;free-born&quot; Americans... &quot;because of their colour&quot;,&quot; not just in the slave states, &quot;but in the states where slavery is regarded with horror... are suffered even to &quot;vote&quot;... being either excluded by law... or excluded, by fear&quot;. Wary of &quot;practical racism&quot; among White Northerners, Neal drew attention to members of his gymnasium who in 1828 &quot;voted that... no colored man... can be permitted to exercise with white citizens of our free and equal-community. Hurra for New-England! We have no prejudices here—None but wholesome prejudices, at any rate.&quot; Disappointed they would not admit the Black men he sponsored for membership, Neal ended his involvement with the gym shortly thereafter. In fiction, Neal explored the differences between Northern and Southern prejudices against Black Americans, particularly in &quot;The Down-Easters&quot; (1833). He nevertheless believed in phrenological inferiority, explaining that &quot;while we disregard &quot;colour&quot;, we pay great attention to &quot;form&quot;, in our estimation of &quot;capacity&quot;. The &quot;negro&quot; head is very bad.&quot; This led him to a proto-eugenicist argument for legalizing interracial marriage so that future generations of &quot;the negroes of America would no longer be a separate, inferior class, without political power, without privilege, and without a share in the great commonwealth&quot;.

===Rights of American Indians===
Neal published essays, novels, and short stories to advocate the rights of American Indians. At a time when &quot;native American&quot; was a nativist term referring to Anglo-Americans, Neal declared in his first novel (1817) that &quot;the Indian is the only native American.&quot; In &quot;A Summary View of America&quot; (1824), Neal argued that American Indians &quot;have never been the aggressors&quot; in conflicts with European-Americans and that &quot;no people, ancient or modern... have been so deplorably oppressed, belied, and wronged, in every possible way.&quot; He called for recognition of Indigenous sovereignty, decrying that &quot;the law of nations has never been regarded, in dealing with them:... their ambassadors have been seized, imprisoned, and butchered... [and] war has never been declared against them&quot;. Outlining the process by which the US government seized Indigenous land, Neal said,
The frontier people pick a quarrel with the Indians... No declaration of war follows; no ceremony; but, forth goes General [Andrew] Jackson—or general somebody else; wasting and firing the whole country. A truce follows: a ceding of the conquered country—for the protection of the whites.
Neal used novels like &quot;Logan&quot; (1822) to challenge racial boundaries between White and Indigenous Americans. Reacting to the Indian Removal Act (1830) and popular literature that supported it, Neal published the short story &quot;David Whicher&quot; (1832) to explore peaceful multiethnic coexistence in the US. The tale also &quot;contested how popular literature employed colonial violence to provide a model of and justification for its continuation in the name of national expansion&quot;.

===Temperance===
As a child, Neal decided to avoid intemperate drinking and maintained this personal conviction throughout his life. He did not associate himself with the temperance movement until after he returned to Portland, Maine, from London. His first invitation to lecture an audience was for the annual address for the Portland Association for the Promotion of Temperance in 1829. Neal Dow, John Neal&#x27;s cousin, was a leader of the prohibition movement, and in 1836 Neal engaged in public debates with his cousin to defend moderate wine drinking as an alternative to total abstinence. It was in this period between the late 1830s and late 1840s that Neal became disillusioned with the temperance movement, which had moved away from a focus on moral suasion to enacting prohibition laws; Dow and his followers &quot;instead of regarding the injunction, &quot;&#x27;Be temperate in all things&quot;,&#x27; were furiously intemperate on the subject of temperance; making total abstinence the condition of citizenship, and almost of civilization.&quot; Neal remained convinced of &quot;the evils of intemperance... They could not well be exaggerated; the only question was about the remedy.&quot;

===Dueling===
In his first novel (1817), Neal portrayed dueling as a holdover from an aristocratic era that is immoral, pointless, antidemocratic, and anti-American, charging &quot;that here, in America, a gentleman may cut another&#x27;s throat, or blow out his brains with complete impunity.&quot; His &quot;Essay on Duelling&quot; that year attacked the institution as a gendered performance, or &quot;the unqualified evidence of manhood&quot;, believing that &quot;in his closet every man wishes duelling abolished, and if every man who wishes it sincerely in private would but speak as firmly in publick , it would be abolished.&quot;

===Social hierarchy===
Neal&#x27;s Quaker upbringing likely instilled in him an aversion to &quot;worldly titles&quot; he said were unfitting in republican society. He mocked them with humorous works like the title page of his first novel (1817) that claimed the book was &quot;Reviewed By—Himself—&#x27;Esquire. In &quot;A Summary View of America&quot; (1824) he decried that the US had fallen away from its ideals of equality to a place in which &quot;titles are multiplying... Even the pride of ancestry... has found root in that republican soil. There is a tremendous contention... between the families of yesterday, and those of the day before.&quot; As a lawyer he refused to address Chief Justice John Marshall or any other judge as &quot;your honor,&quot; claiming that &quot;there is no greater humbug in the minds of men than this obsequious bowing to men of high station. The great thinkers of the world are the workers of the world, the producers of the world.&quot;

===Militia tax===
In his &quot;United States&quot; essay (1826), Neal made his first published argument against the poll tax that financed the US militia system. He said that both &quot;the poor and the rich are taxed... under the militia law&quot; which was designed &quot;to defend property of the rich man. The rich, of course, do not appear in the field. The poor do. The latter cannot afford to keep away; the former can.&quot; He proposed replacing the poll tax with a property tax to pay men serving in militias, thereby making the system more equitable.

===Lotteries===
Neal made his earliest arguments against lotteries in Baltimore newspapers as a law apprentice, then in &quot;Logan&quot; (1822). His argument that the law should treat lotteries the same as other forms of gambling found influence across the US and in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. In &quot;The Yankee&quot;, he &quot;opened fire upon all [lottery] offices... both at the bar, and in our legislative halls, and never rested, until the system was up-rooted... throughout our whole country&quot;. Lotteries fell into disfavor in the US in the 1830s.

===Capital punishment===
Neal began his campaign against public executions after witnessing one in Baltimore. He attacked capital punishment by writing in newspapers, magazines, novels, and debates, achieving national influence in the US and reaching a more limited audience in the UK. Late in life he related still &quot;having no belief in the wisdom of strangulation, for men, women, and children, however they might seem to deserve it, and being fully persuaded that the worst men have most need of repentance, and that they who are unfit to live, are still more unfit to die.&quot;

===Bankruptcy law===
Neal became active in bankruptcy law reform shortly after his own bankruptcy in 1816. As a young Baltimore lawyer he took an unpopular stance against Chief Justice Marshall&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Sturges v. Crowninshield&quot; (1819) and played a prominent role in the movement for a national bankruptcy law. He continued by attacking the policy of imprisonment for debt in his Baltimore novels and in American and British newspapers later in the 1820s.

==Legacy==
===Scattered genius===

Neal&#x27;s reputation as an intellectually dispersed and uncontrolled genius is supported by biographer Windsor Daggett, who said &quot;he scattered his genius into many channels at a loss.&quot; Historian Edward H. Elwell said &quot;he wrote for everything because he could not write long for anything.&quot; By Neal&#x27;s own admission, a year-long stint as newspaper editor was &quot;a long while, for any thing I had to do with.&quot; American literature scholar Fred Lewis Pattee saw Neal&#x27;s as &quot;genius of a type that must be especially defined&quot; with words like &quot;energy and persistence&quot; but also &quot;ignorance colossal&quot;. American literature scholar Theresa A. Goddu concluded that Neal had been canonized as &quot;half wildman, half genius&quot;. Edgar Allan Poe was &quot;inclined to rank John Neal first, or at all events second, among our men of indisputable &quot;genius&quot;&quot;, but in the same paragraph rated his work as &quot;massive and undetailed&quot;, &quot;hurried and indistinct&quot;, and &quot;deficient in a sense of completeness&quot;.

Contemporaries and scholars of Neal alike are disposed to lament his inability to achieve what others saw as the potential of his abilities. Biographer Donald A. Sears classified him as &quot;a writer without a masterpiece&quot; who &quot;lived to be eclipsed by writers of lesser genius but greater control of their talents.&quot; Daggett said &quot;he flashed youthful brilliance. He never quite caught up with it or conquered it, and so he sometimes wore the stamp of failure in the minds of his contemporaries.&quot; American literature scholar Alexander Cowie referred to Neal as &quot;the victim of his own lust for words&quot; with &quot;no single work of fiction which deserves to be revived for its sheer merit&quot; and no books &quot;worth placing on the shelves of any library save as a &#x27;believe it or not&#x27; specimen&quot;. In an 1848 poem, James Russell Lowell classified Neal as &quot;a man who made less than he might have&quot; who was good at &quot;whisking out flocks of comets, but never a star&quot; because he was &quot;too hasty to wait till Art&#x27;s ripe fruit should drop&quot;, and concluded that &quot;could he only have waited he might have been great&quot;.

===Influence===

Neal&#x27;s creative work had indirect influence on many writers during and after his life. Seba Smith, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow are all known to have enjoyed and been influenced by Neal&#x27;s early poems and novels. Smith is most famous for his &quot;Jack Downing&quot; humor series, which was likely influenced by Neal&#x27;s humorous use of regional dialect. It is also likely that Edgar Allan Poe developed many of his characteristic traits as a writer under the influence of Neal&#x27;s articles in &quot;The Yankee&quot; in the late 1820s.

Many scholars conclude that most defining authors of the mid-nineteenth-century American renaissance earned their reputations by employing techniques learned from Neal&#x27;s work earlier in the century, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe, and Herman Melville. Biographer Benjamin Lease pointed to Neal&#x27;s comparatively better remembered immediate predecessors, Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, as lacking an obvious link to those mid-century masters that Neal clearly demonstrates. He further argued that Neal&#x27;s ability to influence such disparate figures as Poe and Whitman demonstrates the weight of his work.

===Historical status===
Aligned with their twentieth-century predecessors, both Lease and Sears in the 1970s classified John Neal as a transitional figure in literature who came after the initial wave of British-imitating American literature but before the great American Renaissance that occurred after Neal had published the bulk of his work. More recent scholarship placed Neal &quot;Not exactly &#x27;beneath&#x27; the &#x27;American Renaissance, but &quot;scattered across it.&quot; American literature scholars Edward Watts, David J. Carlson, and Maya Merlob contended that Neal was written out of the Renaissance because of his distance from the Boston–Concord circle and his utilization of popular styles and modes viewed at a lower artistic level. Despite this neglect in the 20th century, Neal&#x27;s life and works started experiencing a resurgence in interest among scholars in the 21st century.

<text>Leontios () was Bishop of Neapolis (Limassol) in Cyprus in the 7th century. He wrote a &quot;Life&quot; of John the Merciful, commissioned by the archbishop of Constantia Arcadius; a &quot;Life&quot; of Simeon the Holy Fool; a lost &quot;Life&quot; of Spyridon, an apologia against the Jews and another apologia in defence of icons. His apologia in defence of the icons was read by the bishop of Constantia, Constantine II at the Second Council of Nicaea that focused on the Byzantine Iconoclasm. His works are considered among the few works giving any insight into the vernacular Greek of Early and Middle Byzantium. He was probably present at the Lateran council in Rome in 649. His work was translated in Latin and published in Patrologia Graeca. He is also credited with a Dialogue with a Jew, containing a defense of the Christian veneration of images, fragments of which are quoted in the treatise On the Holy Images of John Damascene and in the Acts of the Council of Nicea of 787.

<text>John Norris, sometimes called John Norris of Bemerton (1657–1712), was an English theologian, philosopher and poet associated with the Cambridge Platonists.

==Life==

John Norris was born at Collingbourne Kingston, Wiltshire. He was educated at Winchester School, and Exeter College, Oxford, gaining a B.A. in 1680. He was later appointed a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford (M.A. 1684). He lived a quiet life as a country parson and thinker at Fugglestone St Peter with Bemerton, Wiltshire, from 1692 until his death early in 1712.

==Works==
In philosophy he was a Platonist and mystic. He became an early opponent of John Locke, whose &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1690) he attacked in &quot;Christian Blessedness or Discourses upon the Beatitudes&quot; in the same year; he also combatted Locke&#x27;s theories in his &quot;Essay toward the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World&quot; (1701–4). He attacked religious schism in &quot;Christian Blessedness&quot; and &quot;The Charge of Schism, Continued.&quot; 
Others among his 23 works are &quot;An Idea of Happiness&quot; (1683), &quot;Miscellanies&quot; (1687), &quot;Theory and Regulation of Love&quot; (1688), and a &quot;Discourse concerning the Immortality of the Soul&quot; (1708). His most popular work is &quot;A Collection of Miscellanies, consisting of Poems, Essays, Discourses and Letters&quot; (1687).

His frequently-cited poem &quot;The Resignation&quot; was often published during the first half of the eighteenth century. Samuel Richardson quoted it to Andrew Millar (a prominent London bookseller) on the death of Millar&#x27;s son, possibly from the then most recent edition, &quot;A Collection of Miscellanies&quot; (London: E. Parker, 1740).

<doc id="1189627" wikidata="Q850141" url="?curid=1189627" title="Caroline Norton">
<text>Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton, Lady Stirling-Maxwell (&quot;née&quot; Sheridan; 22 March 1808 – 15 June 1877) was an active English social reformer and author. She left her husband, who was accused by many of coercive behaviour, in 1836. Her husband then sued her close friend Lord Melbourne, then the Whig Prime Minister, for criminal conversation (adultery). 

Although the jury found her friend not guilty of adultery, she failed to gain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons due to the laws at the time which favoured fathers. Norton&#x27;s campaigning led to the passage of the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870. She modelled for the fresco of &quot;Justice&quot; in the House of Lords by Daniel Maclise, who chose her as a famous victim of injustice.

==Youth and marriage==
Caroline Norton was born in London to Thomas Sheridan and the novelist Caroline Henrietta Callander. Her father was an actor, soldier and colonial administrator, the son of the prominent Irish playwright and Whig statesman Richard Brinsley Sheridan and his wife Elizabeth Ann Linley. Caroline&#x27;s Scottish mother was the daughter of a landed gentleman, Col. Sir James Callander of Craigforth and Lady Elizabeth MacDonnell, sister of an Irish peer, the 1st Marquess of Antrim. Mrs. Sheridan authored three short novels described by one of her daughter&#x27;s biographers as &quot;rather stiff with the style of the eighteenth century, but none without a certain charm and wit...&quot;

In 1817, her father died in South Africa while serving as colonial secretary at the Cape of Good Hope. His family was left almost penniless. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, an old friend of her grandfather, arranged for them to live at Hampton Court Palace in a &quot;grace and favour&quot; apartment for several years.

The combined beauty and accomplishments of the Sheridan sisters led to their being collectively referred to as the Three &quot;Graces&quot;. The eldest, Helen, was a songwriter who married Price Blackwood, the 4th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye. Through her, Caroline became the aunt of Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, later the third Governor General of Canada and eighth Viceroy of India. Her younger sister, Georgiana, seen as the prettiest, later married Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset.

In 1827, she married George Chapple Norton, barrister, Member of Parliament for Guildford, and the younger brother of Lord Grantley. George was a jealous and possessive husband given to violent fits of drunkenness. The union quickly proved unhappy due to his mental and physical abuse. To make matters worse, George was unsuccessful as a barrister, and the couple fought bitterly over money.

During her early married years, Caroline used her beauty, wit and political ties to set herself up as a major society hostess. Her unorthodox behaviour and candid conversation raised many eyebrows in 19th-century English high society; she made enemies and admirers in almost equal measure. Among her friends were literary and political luminaries such as Samuel Rogers, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Edward Trelawny, Abraham Hayward, Mary Shelley, Fanny Kemble, Benjamin Disraeli, the future King Leopold I of Belgium and William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. She also claimed in later life to have taken part in the Tolpuddle Martyrs protest march in 1834.

Despite his jealousy and pride, George encouraged his wife to use her ties to advance his career. It was through her influence that in 1831 he was made a Metropolitan Police Magistrate. During these years, Caroline turned to prose and poetry as means of releasing her inner emotions and earning money. Her first book, &quot;The Sorrows of Rosalie&quot; (1829), was well received. &quot;The Undying One&quot; (1830), a romance founded on the legend of the Wandering Jew, soon followed. From 1832 to 1837, she edited &quot;The Court Magazine and Belle Assemblée&quot;. In 1843, she petitioned Sir Robert Peel for the post of Poet Laureate after the death of Robert Southey, but was unsuccessful.

==Separation and Melbourne scandal==
In 1836, Caroline left her husband. She managed to subsist on her earnings as an author, but George claimed these as his, arguing this successfully in court. Paid nothing by her husband and her earnings confiscated, Norton used the law to her own advantage. Running up bills in her husband&#x27;s name, she told the creditors when they came to collect, that if they wished to be paid, they could sue her husband.

Not long after their separation, George abducted their sons, hiding them with relatives in Scotland and later in Yorkshire, refusing to tell Caroline their whereabouts. George accused Caroline of involvement in an ongoing affair with a close friend, Lord Melbourne, then Whig Prime Minister. Initially, George demanded £10,000 from Melbourne, but Melbourne refused to be blackmailed and George instead took the Prime Minister to court.

Lord Melbourne wrote to Lord Holland, &quot;The fact is [that George] is a stupid brute, and [Caroline] had not temper nor dissimulation enough to enable her to manage him.&quot; Despite this admission, hoping to avert an even worse scandal, he pleaded with Caroline to return to George, insisting that &quot;a woman should never part from her husband whilst she can remain with him.&quot; Lord Melbourne relented a few days later, stating that he understood her decision to leave:

This conduct upon his part seems perfectly unaccountable...You know that I have always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought it for the best. I am afraid it is no longer possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that you have done your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.

At the end of a nine-day trial, the jury threw out George&#x27;s claim, siding with Melbourne, but the publicity almost brought down the government. The scandal eventually died, but not before Caroline&#x27;s reputation was ruined and her friendship with Melbourne destroyed. George continued to keep Caroline from seeing her three sons and blocked her from receiving a divorce. Under English law in 1836, children were the legal property of their father and there was little Caroline could do to regain custody.

==Political activity==

Caroline soon faced an additional tragedy; the death of her youngest son, William, in 1842. The child, out riding alone, fell from his horse and was injured. According to Caroline, the child&#x27;s wounds were minor, but they were not properly treated and blood-poisoning set in. George, realising that the child was near death, sent for Caroline. Unfortunately, William died before she arrived in Scotland. Caroline blamed George for the child&#x27;s death, accusing him of neglect. After William&#x27;s death, George allowed Caroline to visit their sons, but he retained full custody and all of her visits were supervised.

Due to her dismal domestic situation, Caroline became deeply involved in the passage of laws promoting social justice, especially those granting rights to married and divorced women. Her poems &quot;A Voice from the Factories&quot; (1836) and &quot;The Child of the Islands&quot; (1845) centred on her political views.

When Parliament debated divorce reform in 1855, Caroline submitted to members a detailed account of her own marriage, and described the difficulties faced by women as the result of existing laws.
An English wife may not leave her husband&#x27;s house. Not only can he sue her for restitution of &quot;conjugal rights,&quot; but he has a right to enter the house of any friend or relation with whom she may take refuge...and carry her away by force...

If her husband take proceedings for a divorce, she is not, in the first instance, allowed to defend herself...She is not represented by attorney, nor permitted to be considered a party to the suit between him and her supposed lover, for &quot;damages.&quot;

If an English wife be guilty of infidelity, her husband can divorce her so as to marry again; but she cannot divorce the husband, a vinculo, however profligate he may be...

Those dear children, the loss of whose pattering steps and sweet occasional voices made the silence of [my] new home intolerable as the anguish of death...what I suffered respecting those children, God knows ... under the evil law which suffered any man, for vengeance or for interest, to take baby children from the mother.
Mainly through Caroline&#x27;s intense campaigning, which included a letter to Queen Victoria, Parliament passed the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870, which she worked on with the suffragist Barbara Bodichon. One recent biographer, Diane Atkinson, notes that unlike in 1839 and 1857, Caroline played no part in campaigning for the 1870 Act. Under the Custody of Children Act, legally separated or divorced wives, provided they were not found guilty of criminal conversation, were granted the custody of their children up to the age of seven, and periodic access thereafter. The Act applied in England, Wales and Ireland only. While Caroline could have hoped for custody of her youngest son, and access to her older sons who were seven and ten when the Act was passed into law, her husband insisted that they stay in Scotland.

The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to petition in the Court of Chancery, in practice few women had the financial means to exert their rights. The Matrimonial Causes Act reformed the law on divorce, among others making divorce more affordable, and established a model of marriage based on contract. The Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 allowed married women to inherit property and take court action on their own behalf. The Act granted married women in the UK, for the first time, a separate legal identity from their husband.

In 1849 Daniel Maclise finished his fresco of &quot;Justice&quot; in the House of Lords, for which Caroline had modelled. He chose her as one seen by many as a famous victim of injustice. Caroline&#x27;s old friend Lord Melbourne opposed the reforms she fought for. He was scolded for his opposition by Queen Victoria; the Queen wrote that he defended his actions, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you should give a woman too much right... there should not be two conflicting powers... a man ought to have the right in a family.&quot;

While Caroline fought to extend women&#x27;s legal rights, she eschewed further social activism and had no interest in the 19th-century women&#x27;s movement on issues such as women&#x27;s suffrage. In fact, in an article published in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1838, she countered a claim that she was a &quot;radical&quot;: &quot;The natural position of woman is inferiority to man. Amen! That is a thing of God&#x27;s appointing, not of man&#x27;s devising. I believe it sincerely, as part of my religion. I never pretended to the wild and ridiculous doctrine of equality.&quot;

==Later life==
Caroline is said to have had a five-year affair with a prominent Conservative politician Sidney Herbert in the early 1840s, but Herbert married another woman in 1846. In middle age, she befriended the author George Meredith. She served as the inspiration for Diana Warwick, the intelligent, fiery-tempered heroine of Meredith&#x27;s novel &quot;Diana of the Crossways&quot;, published in 1885. Caroline finally became free with George&#x27;s death in 1875. She married an old friend, the Scottish historical writer and politician Sir W. Stirling Maxwell in March 1877. Caroline died in London three months later.

==Family and descendants==
Caroline&#x27;s eldest son, Fletcher Norton, died of tuberculosis in Paris at the age of 30. She was devastated by the loss.

In 1854, her remaining son, Thomas Brinsley Norton, married a young Italian, Maria Chiara Elisa Federigo, whom he met in Naples. Thomas also suffered from poor health, and spent much of his life as an invalid, reliant upon his mother for financial assistance. Despite this, he lived long enough to succeed his uncle as 4th Baron Grantley of Markenfield. Lord Grantley also predeceased his mother, dying in 1877.

Thomas&#x27; son, John, inherited the title and estates. The 5th Lord Grantley was a numismatist, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, the Royal Numismatic Society and the British Numismatic Society. He assembled a large collection of coins and grew orchids. John caused a scandal in 1879 by running off with another man&#x27;s wife, the former Katharine McVickar, daughter of a wealthy American stockbroker. The jilted husband was the 5th Lord Grantley&#x27;s older cousin, Major Charles Grantley Campbell Norton. Katharine&#x27;s marriage to Charles was annulled, and Katharine and John were married that November, five days before the birth of their first child. Despite her scandalous introduction to British society, Katharine went on to become a successful London hostess.

==Commemoration==
In April 2021 English Heritage announced that Caroline was one of six women to be honoured that year with a blue plaque marking her central London home for over 30 years. It was unveiled on 3 Chesterfield Street, Mayfair by Antonia Fraser.

<doc id="1189630" wikidata="Q918776" url="?curid=1189630" title="British Astronomical Association">
<text>The British Astronomical Association (BAA) was formed in 1890 as a national body to support the UK&#x27;s amateur astronomers.

Throughout its history, the BAA has encouraged observers to make scientifically valuable observations, often in collaboration with professional colleagues. Among the BAA&#x27;s first presidents was Walter Maunder, discoverer of the seventeenth century dearth in sunspots now known as the Maunder Minimum which he achieved by analysing historical observations. Later, this spirit of observing the night sky scientifically was championed by George Alcock, who discovered five comets and five novae using nothing more than a pair of binoculars.

The BAA continues to contribute to the science of astronomy, even despite modern competition from space-based telescopes and highly automated professional observatories. Modern digital sensors, coupled with techniques such as lucky imaging, mean that even modest amateur equipment can rival what professional observatories could have achieved a few decades ago. The vastness of the night sky, together with the sheer number of amateur observatories, mean that BAA members are often the first to pick up new phenomena. In recent years, the Association&#x27;s leading supernova hunter, Tom Boles (President 2003–5), has discovered over 150 supernovae. He now holds the world record for the greatest number of such events discovered by any individual in history.

More recently the BAA has worked increasingly with international partners. Modern communications allow astronomers in different time zones around the world to hand over the monitoring of variable stars and planetary weather systems to colleagues on other continents as the Sun comes up, resulting in a 24-hour watch on the sky. For example, the Association&#x27;s Variable Star Section works closely with the American Association of Variable Star Observers, meanwhile its Jupiter Section works with a global network of planetary observers through the JUPOS collaboration.

==Publications==
The Association&#x27;s longest standing publication is its journal, published six times a year and sent to all members. Once a year, the Association also publishes a handbook which comprises an almanac for the following year. Electronic bulletins are issued to give more immediate notice by email of discoveries, astronomical news and BAA meetings.

==Structure==
The Association operates a wide range of observing Sections which specialise in particular branches of astronomy, welcoming observers and astronomy enthusiasts of all abilities in a spirit of collaboration and mutual help.

It also founded and supports the Campaign for Dark Skies, a UK-wide campaign against excessive light pollution.

In 2022, after seventy-nine years of leasing office space from the Royal Astronomical Society, in Burlington House, Piccadilly, London the association moved out.

==History==
In October 1890, the BAA was formed to support amateur astronomers in the UK. In many ways it is a counterpart to the Royal Astronomical Society - which primarily supports professional observers - and the two organisations have long shared the same premises. The idea for this organisation was first publicly proposed by Irish astronomer William H. S. Monck in a letter published in &quot;The English Mechanic&quot; on 12 July.

Playing a significant role in the founding of the Association was English astronomer E. Walter Maunder, with the help of his brother Frid Maunder and William H. Maw. The first meeting of the Association was held on 24 October 1890, with 60 of the initial 283 members in attendance. Initially it was decided to run the association with a provisional 48-member Council that included four women: Margaret Huggins, Elizabeth Brown, Agnes Clerke and Agnes Giberne.

The society formed several observing Sections for specialised topics in astronomy. Elizabeth Brown, possibly the only woman in England at the time to own her own observatory, became Director of the Solar Section. The Association was presented with or bequeathed various astronomical instruments, but lacked the funds to build their own observatory. A total of 477 instruments were acquired during the first 117 years since the Association was founded.

==Eclipse Expeditions==
In addition to members making independent arrangements there have been several more or less officially organised expeditions to observe several total solar eclipses in various parts of the World. These include:-
*1896 to Vadsø, Norway for the eclipse of 9 August.
*1898 to India for the eclipse of 22 January.
*1900 to the United States, Portugal, Spain, Algeria and at sea (aboard the R.M.S. Austral) for the eclipse of 28 May.
*1905 to Burgos (Spain), Labrador (Canada) and at sea (aboard the ss Arcadia) for the eclipse of 30 August.
*1914 for eclipse of 21 August.
*1922 to Stanthorpe (Queensland) by members of the New South Wales Branch for the eclipse of 21 September.
*1936 to the Mediterranean for the eclipse of 19 June.
*1973 aboard the cruise ship Monte Umbe 30 June.
*1999 to Truro, Cornwall for the eclipse of 11 August.

==Branches==
The Association held monthly meetings in London, but also established branches to cater for members who could not attend London activities and desired to meet in their own areas.

The first of these was the Northwestern Branch which served members in the Northwest of England, centred on Manchester. The Branch was formed in 1892, in 1903 it seceded from the BAA to form the Manchester Astronomical Society.

**Samuel O’Kell 1892–1895
**Prof. Thomas Hamilton Core 1895–1903

In 1891, a group of amateurs in Australia began discussing the idea of setting up branches of the BAA in their own country. What would become the New South Wales Branch was established in 1895 and would be the only one to survive for more than a brief period. This branch became the second oldest astronomy organisation in Australia and is still in existence. It is an affiliate organisation now called Sydney City Skywatchers to better reflect its location and membership.

A West of Scotland Branch was established by an inaugural meeting held on 23 November 1894, to be based in Glasgow. In 1905 authority was granted to enrol members from the whole of Scotland, but it was not until 1937 that the name was changed to &quot;Scottish Branch&quot;. In 1954 the Branch seceded from the BAA to form the Astronomical Society of Glasgow.

<doc id="1189635" wikidata="Q6250929" url="?curid=1189635" title="John O'Keeffe (writer)">
<text>John O&#x27;Keeffe (24 June 1747 – 4 February 1833) was an Irish actor and dramatist. He wrote a number of farces, amusing dramatic pieces and librettos for pasticcio operas, many of which had great success. Among these are &quot;Tony Lumpkin in Town&quot; (1778), &quot;Love in a Camp&quot; (1786), and &quot;Omai&quot; (1785), an account of the voyages of the Tahitian explorer Omai, and &quot;Wild Oats&quot; (1791).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Keeffe was born in Abbey Street, Dublin in 1747 to Roman Catholic parents and was educated by the Jesuits. His father was from King&#x27;s County and his mother (née O&#x27;Connor) from County Wexford. After showing a talent for drawing he studied art at an academy in Dublin, but grew increasingly more interested in the theatre. After a two-year period in London, where he became an admirer of David Garrick, he settled on a career as an actor and playwright. O&#x27;Keeffe wrote his first play &quot;The She Gallant&quot; when he was twenty, and it was performed in Dublin at the Smock Alley Theatre. In Cork, in late September 1774, O&#x27;Keeffe married Mary Heaphy, a Protestant actress and the daughter of Tottenham Heaphy, manager of the Dublin Theatre Royal. The marriage ended badly when O&#x27;Keeffe discovered that she was having an affair with the Scottish actor George Graham. O&#x27;Keeffe left Ireland with their children, and Mary was denied access to her son and daughter, John Tottenham O&#x27;Keeffe and Adelaide O&#x27;Keeffe. Mary Heaphy, according to Adelaide O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s memoir of her father, married Graham without first divorcing her husband. She did not consider her marriage to the Catholic John O&#x27;Keeffe to be sufficiently binding.

==Success==
In 1777, O&#x27;Keeffe moved to London. The following year he wrote &quot;Tony Lumpkin in Town&quot;, a sequel to Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, and sent it to the manager of the Haymarket Theatre. The play was successfully produced, and O&#x27;Keeffe regularly wrote for the Haymarket thereafter. In 1782, O&#x27;Keeffe had his two children sent abroad to France to prevent their mother&#x27;s access to them. His son did well but his daughter suffered in convent schools.

Between 1782 and 1796, O&#x27;Keeffe wrote around 28 plays and librettos for comic operas. &quot;The Poor Soldier&quot; (1783), a comic opera with libretto by O&#x27;Keeffe and music by William Shield, was a farce about the lives of British soldiers returning home after the American War of Independence. O&#x27;Keeffe also wrote &quot;The Son-in-Law&quot;, &quot;Agreeable Surprise&quot; (which includes the lyrical poem &quot;Amo, Amas&quot;), and &quot;The Castle of Andalusia&quot;.

O&#x27;Keeffe had problems with his eyes ever since he had fallen into the River Liffey in his youth. From the mid-1770s, O&#x27;Keeffe increasingly lost his sight, and from 1781 his plays had to be dictated by him. In spite of this, he was a prolific writer and was the most-frequently produced playwright in London in the last quarter of the 18th century. O&#x27;Keeffe contributed many Irish folksongs to the musical scores by Samuel Arnold and Shield such as &quot;I am a Friar of Orders Grey&quot; and &quot;The Thorn&quot; are still popular. For many of these songs, the comic operas are the earliest source. From 1788, his only daughter Adelaide became his amanuensis and eventual caretaker until his death. Adelaide O&#x27;Keeffe was a popular novelist and an important children&#x27;s poet who authored the first children&#x27;s novel in verse, &quot;A Trip to the Coast&quot; (1819).

In 1800, a benefit performance was staged for him at Covent Garden. In 1826, O&#x27;Keeffe wrote his memoirs, which covered his life experiences and various interactions with the leading artistic figures of his day. The memoirs were dictated to his daughter Adelaide who oversaw their publication. The same year he was awarded a pension by George IV. However, much of the information in his memoir is not accurate. In the year following his death, Adelaide O&#x27;Keeffe completed her own memoir of her father; &quot;Memoir&quot; prefaced her edited collection of his poetry, &quot;O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Legacy to His Daughter, Being the Poetic Works of the Late John O&#x27;Keeffe, Esq., the Dramatic Author&quot;. He died in 1833 in Southampton and was buried there.

==Legacy==
In the 19th century, the essayist William Hazlitt described O&#x27;Keeffe as the &quot;English Molière&quot;, observing &quot;in light, careless laughter and pleasant exaggeration of the humorous, we have no equal to him&quot;. His &quot;Wild Oats&quot; has been revived in 1976, 1995 and 2012 by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal National Theatre and the Bristol Old Vic respectively.

<doc id="1189639" wikidata="Q6029461" url="?curid=1189639" title="Robert Orme">
<text>Robert Orme (25 December 1728 – 13 January 1801) was a British historian of India. Son of a British East India Company physician and surgeon, he entered the service of the Company in Bengal in 1743. He was regarded as an authority on India.

He was appointed as a Member of the Council at Fort St. George, Madras, between 1754 and 1758. In that capacity he was instrumental in the sending of a young Robert Clive as the head of a punitive expedition in 1757 to Calcutta, after the Black Hole incident of 1756. He returned to England in 1760, and was appointed as historiographer to the British East India Company in 1769.

Orme wrote &quot;A History of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan from 1745&quot; (1763–78). He also published &quot;Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, the Morattoes and English Concerns in Indostan from the year 1659&quot; (1782).

==Life==
Born on Christmas Day 1728 at Anjengo, Travancore State, India, he was the second son of Alexander Orme, a physician and surgeon in the service of the East India Company. His mother&#x27;s maiden name was Hill. He was sent when about two years old to the house of his aunt, Mrs. Robert Adams, in Cavendish Square, London. From about 1734 to 1741 he was educated at Harrow School under Dr James Cox, and was then placed for a year in the office of the accountant-general of the Royal African Company.

In 1742 Orme went to Calcutta, where his elder brother William was a Writer in the East India Company. Orme engaged himself in the mercantile house of Jackson &amp; Wedderburn at Calcutta, and made a voyage to Surat. On returning to Calcutta in 1743 he was himself appointed a Writer in the East India Company&#x27;s service. He acquired a reputation for knowledge of Indian customs, and in 1752 was asked to state his opinion on the regulation of the police in Calcutta. In 1753 he visited England, and during his absence in 1754 was appointed by the court of directors a member of the council at Madras. Returning to India, he arrived at Madras on 14 September 1754. He took an active part in the deliberations of the council respecting the military operations in the Carnatic, 1754–8, and recommended the appointment of Clive to command the expedition against Suráj-ud-Dowlah. Orme was for some years close to Clive, but the friendship was broken off about 1769.

From 1757 to 1758 Orme was commissary and accountant-general. At the end of 1758, his health being poor, he left India with a small fortune. The &quot;Grantham&quot;, the ship in which he sailed, was captured by the French on 4 January 1759 and taken to Mauritius. Orme ultimately reached Nantes in France in the spring of 1760.

In the autumn of 1760 Orme bought a house in Harley Street, London. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 8 November 1770, and from about 1769 till his death was salaried historiographer to the East India Company.

In 1792 Orme retired to Great Ealing, Middlesex, where he died on 13 January 1801, in his 73rd year. He was buried on 21 January in the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s, Ealing where there was a memorial tablet. He was an admirer of Samuel Johnson.

==Works==
In 1752 Orme drew up part of &quot;A General Idea of the Government and People of Indostan&quot;. This was afterwards completed, and posthumously published in Orme&#x27;s &quot;Historical Fragments&quot;, edition of 1805. Orme was given access to the records at the India House, and obtained information from the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, whom he visited in 1773 at his country seat in France.

In London, Orme formed a library of ancient and modern classics, and arranged his materials – collected since 1742 – for an Indian history. In August 1763 he published the first volume of his major work, &quot;A History of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan from the year 1745&quot;; vol. ii. was published in two parts in 1778. Orme was complimented on his work by Sir William Jones.

George Bruce Malleson, in his &quot;History of the French in India&quot;, thought Orme&#x27;s history generally accurate, though failing to treat the French as principals in the story. Orme told Samuel Parr that in preparing the third volume he completely formed every sentence in his mind before writing it down. A third edition of the work appeared in 1780, a fourth in 1790, a fifth in 1799. There were other editions in 1803 and 1861 in London, and Madras. In 1782 Orme published &quot;Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, of the Morattoes, and of the English Concerns in Indostan from the year 1659&quot;. This was reprinted in 1805 (London), with a memoir of the author, giving some extracts from his correspondence with William Robertson the historian, and others (cf. Edin. Rev. January 1807, p. 391 seq.). Orme&#x27;s essays ‘On the Origin of the English Establishment … at Broach and Surat’ and ‘A General Idea of the Government and People of Indostan’ were included in this volume.

==Family==
Orme was married, but this is said to have been unknown even to close friends during his lifetime. The court of directors of the East India Company gave his widow an annuity.

==Legacy==
A bust of Orme at the age of forty-six, made in 1774 by Joseph Nollekens, was bequeathed to the East India Company; an engraving of it forms the frontispiece to Orme&#x27;s &quot;Historical Fragments&quot;, ed. 1805.

Orme bequeathed to his friend and executor, John Roberts, chairman of the court of directors, all his books, manuscripts, &amp;c., with a request – duly carried out – that he would present them to the East India Company. This collection, which went to the library of the India Office, consisted of 51 volumes of printed tracts on India and the East India Company; 231 manuscript volumes, compiled by Orme, containing information on Indian affairs; letters relating to the company&#x27;s affairs; and maps, charts, plans, &amp;c. In the maps accompanying his published works Orme had marked hundreds of places for the first time. A part of Orme&#x27;s library had been sold by him at Sotheby&#x27;s about April 1796, when he gave up his house in Harley Street.

<text>Caesar Otway (1780–1842) was an Irish writer and clergyman who wanted to study and improve the condition of the poor.

==Life==
Caesar Otway was born at Castle Otway near Nenagh, County Tipperary, Ireland. His parents were Cooke and Elizabeth Otway and his elder brothers included Admiral Robert Otway and Loftus who became a general. Cooke had been an officer in the Irish Volunteers militia.

Otway matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 December 1796, being then 16 years old, and graduated B.A. in 1801. He took holy orders in the Church of Ireland in 1810. He worked as a parish priest for 17 years, before becoming assistant chaplain at the Magdalen Asylum, Leeson Street in Dublin.

Otway was involved in the establishment of a number of journals. With Joseph Henderson Singer, he started, in 1825, the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot;, the first Irish religious magazine for Anglicans. He was a good friend of the writer William Carleton, who first made his mark in the &quot;Examiner&quot;. He co-operated with George Petrie in the first volume of the &quot;Dublin Penny Journal&quot;, where he wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Terence O&#x27;Toole.&quot; He was also a contributor to the &quot;Dublin University Magazine.&quot;

Otway died on 16 March 1842 in Dublin, at the age of 63.

==Works==
Otway is best remembered as a writer of Irish tales. His writings, which display humour and sympathy with the poorer classes in Ireland, include &quot;Sketches in Ireland&quot; (1827), &quot;Sketches in Erris and Tyrawley&quot; and &quot;A Tour in Connaught&quot; (1839). Other works were:

* &quot;A Letter the Roman Catholic Priests of Ireland&quot;, 1814, as &quot;C. O.&quot; 
* &quot;A Lecture on Miracles...with Appendices&quot;, 1823. 
* &quot;The Intellectuality of Domestic Animals&quot;, 1817.

==Family==
In 1803 Otway married Frances Hastings with whom he had five children: John Hastings Otway, Caesar George Otway, Loftus Otway, Jane Otway and Frances Otway. After Frances died in 1833, he remarried on 17 January 1837; his second wife was Elizabeth la Touche, daughter of James Digges la Touche of Dublin,

<text>George Outram (25 March 1805 – 15 September 1856) was a Scottish humorous poet, Scottish advocate, friend of John Wilson, and for some time editor of &quot;The Herald&quot; in Glasgow.

==Life==

Outram was born on 25 March 1805 the son of Elizabeth Knox (1779–1866) and Joseph Outram, manager of the Clyde Ironworks. He was born in the parish of New Monkland and Coatbridge. In 1807 the family moved to Leith, the harbour area of Edinburgh. He attended Leith High School and then the University of Edinburgh. He qualified as an advocate in 1827.

In the 1830s he is listed as living at 14 Fettes Row, on the northern fringe of Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town.

In 1837 he married Frances McRobbie (d.1880) who had been born in Jamaica. In the same year he took over the parent company which printed the &quot;Glasgow Herald,&quot; founded in 1783 by John Mennons. Under Outram&#x27;s leadership the company grew considerably, becoming the &quot;eponymous&quot; Scottish printing company and renaming itself George Outram &amp; Co. From 19 July 1839 the newspaper bore the name of &quot;Outram &amp; Co&quot; as its printer.

He died at his country residence of Rosemore on the Holy Loch near Dunoon on 15 September 1856.
