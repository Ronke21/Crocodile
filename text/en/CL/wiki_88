It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority, led first by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the 22nd Canadian Ministry, and then by Prime Minister John Turner and the 23rd Canadian Ministry.

<text>James Robert Rebhorn (September 1, 1948 – March 21, 2014) was an American character actor. Rebhorn appeared in over 100 films, television series, and plays.

Rebhorn portrayed George Wilbur in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, Dr. McElwaine in &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, and FBI Agent Flynn in &quot;White Sands&quot; and Mr. Trask in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (all in 1992), John Merino in &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot;, Albert Nimziki in &quot;Independence Day&quot; , Charlie Reynolds in &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot; , Alvin Hooks in &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; , and Dr. Larry Banks in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;.

He had several recurring roles in TV series, including Charles Garnett/ Dr. Horace Garrison/Albert Lawrence Cheney in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Captain Elchisak in &quot;Third Watch&quot;, Bertram Webster in &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;, Reese Hughes in &quot;White Collar&quot;, Carl Franklin in &quot;Big Lake&quot;, and Frank Mathison in &quot;Homeland&quot;.

==Early life==
Rebhorn was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Ardell Frances (&quot;née&quot; Hoch) and James Harry Rebhorn, an industrial engineer and salesman. He was of German descent. Rebhorn moved to Anderson, Indiana, as a child and graduated from Madison Heights High School in 1966. A devout Lutheran, he attended Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, where he studied political science.

While there, he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Richard S. Huffman was one of his instructors and directed him in a lead role in Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Lysistrata&quot; as well as Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tricks of Scapin&quot;. After graduating in 1970, Rebhorn moved to New York City, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts in acting from Columbia University&#x27;s School of the Arts, and joined the metropolitan theater scene.

==Career==
An early performance was in &quot;Butterflies are Free&quot; at the Peterborough Players in New Hampshire in 1974. Rebhorn played Peter Latham in &quot;Forty Carats&quot; at the GasLight Dinner Theatre in Salt Lake City in the 1970s. He was known both for portraying WASP stereotypes, lawyers, politicians, doctors, and military men, as well as portraying individuals engaged in or responsible for criminal behavior.

He delivered equally notable performances in a variety of other roles, including that of a brutal serial killer on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (he would later return to the show in the recurring role of defense attorney Charles Garnett), Ellard Muscatine in &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992), Fred Waters in &quot;Blank Check&quot; (1994), Clyde Frost, the father of famed bullrider Lane Frost, in &quot;8 Seconds&quot; (1994), Lt. Tyler in &quot;White Squall&quot; (1996), and a shipping magnate in &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999).

One of his best known performances was in the popular 1996 film &quot;Independence Day&quot;, where he played Secretary of Defense Albert Nimziki. He acted in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992), and played an expert witness in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; (1992). He appeared in &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; as an obsessed district attorney the following year. Rebhorn played an FBI agent in the 1994 film &quot;Guarding Tess&quot;.

Rebhorn played several roles on television, including an abusive stepfather, Bradley Raines, on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1983 to 1985, and an abusive father, Henry Lange, on sister soap &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1988 to 1991. An earlier daytime role was as John Brady in &quot;Texas&quot; from 1981 to 1982.

In 1991, he played the role of Ezra in the television movie/pilot &quot;Plymouth&quot;. He cameoed in Madonna&#x27;s video for her single &quot;Bad Girl&quot; along with Christopher Walken (1993). In 1994, he appeared in an episode of the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, titled &quot;Farewell, My Little Viking&quot;, as Mr. McFlemp.

In 1998, he played the district attorney in the two part series finale of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. He appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Regarding Henry&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; and &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the Chris Rock film &quot;Head of State&quot;, as Democratic Senator Bill Arnot. In 2004, he appeared in the television miniseries &quot;Reversible Errors&quot;. His role in the short-lived and controversial NBC drama &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot; cast him as the father of the title character. From 2009 to 2013, Rebhorn played the recurring role of Reese Hughes, the FBI white-collar division chief, on &quot;White Collar&quot;.

Starting in 2011, Rebhorn appeared in the Showtime series &quot;Homeland&quot; as Frank Mathison, father of the series&#x27; main character Carrie Mathison, played by Claire Danes. His character suffered from bipolar disorder like Danes&#x27;s character did. However, Frank had been able to get it under control and became quite functional on a daily basis with the correct dosing of medications, and would often encourage Carrie to do the same. Rebhorn&#x27;s death in 2014 meant his character died in the show as well. The season 4 finale of &quot;Homeland&quot; was dedicated to him.

In 2004 he appeared on Broadway as Juror 4 in the Roundabout Theatre Company production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; at the American Airlines Theatre.

Rebhorn appeared as a judge in &quot;Baby Mama&quot;. In the movie &quot;The Box&quot;, Rebhorn portrayed a NASA scientist. He had a recurring role on the series &quot;White Collar&quot; as Special Agent Reese Hughes. Rebhorn co-starred in the Comedy Central sitcom &quot;Big Lake&quot; in 2010. He played Max Kenton&#x27;s uncle in the movie &quot;Real Steel&quot; in 2011. He starred as Oren in the miniseries &quot;Coma&quot;. Rebhorn starred as Gary Pandamiglio in the 2012 Mike Birbiglia comedy &quot;Sleepwalk with Me&quot;.

In 2012, he played the role of Archbishop McGovern in &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, the 13th episode of the second season of the CBS police procedural drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. He co-starred in the romantic comedy &quot;The Perfect Wedding&quot; in 2013. His stage career included seven Broadway productions, as well as numerous appearances with New York City&#x27;s Roundabout Theatre Company.

==Personal life==
Rebhorn was married to Rebecca Linn and was the father of two daughters.

==Death ==
Rebhorn died at his home in South Orange, New Jersey on March 21, 2014, as a result of melanoma, which he had been battling since 1992. Rebhorn wrote his own obituary.

<doc id="1186186" wikidata="Q117443" url="?curid=1186186" title="Peter Skene Ogden">
<text>Peter Skene Ogden (alternately Skeene, Skein, or Skeen; baptised 12 February 1790 – 27 September 1854) was a British-Canadian fur trader and an early explorer of what is now British Columbia and the Western United States. During his many expeditions, he explored parts of Oregon, Washington, Nevada, California, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Despite early confrontations with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) while working for the North West Company, he later became a senior official in the operations of the HBC&#x27;s Columbia Department, serving as manager of Fort Simpson and similar posts.

==Family==
Ogden was a son of Chief Justice of the Admiralty Court (1788-1808) Isaac Ogden of Quebec and his wife Sarah Hanson. The family was descended from a 17th-century British emigrant to the American colonies (Long Island and New Jersey).

Both Isaac and his father David were Loyalists during the American Revolution; Isaac relocated to England at this time, then later returned to British-run Quebec. One of Peter&#x27;s brothers, Charles Richard Ogden, was a lawyer, politician, and public servant from Canada East. Peter Skene Ogden married Julia Rivet/Reava, a Metis/Nez Perce.

==Professional life==
After a brief time with the American Fur Company, Ogden joined the North West Company in 1809. His first post was at Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan, in 1810, and by 1814 he was in charge of a post at Green Lake, Saskatchewan, south.

Ogden had frequent run-ins with the rival HBC employees and engaged in physical violence on several occasions. In 1816, HBC clerks reported that Ogden killed an Indian who had traded with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The Indian was &quot;butchered in a most cruel manner&quot;, according to HBC officer James Bird. Although many in the North West Company viewed this as a necessary part of living in the Northwest, the HBC viewed Ogden as a dangerous man whose actions were deplorable, especially considering his background as the son of a judge. Ogden was charged with murder, and the North West Company moved him further west to attempt to avoid any further confrontations with the HBC. He served at different posts in modern-day Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia for the next several years.
As a way of ending the ongoing strife between the two companies, the HBC and the North West Company merged in 1821. Ogden&#x27;s violent history placed the now larger HBC in a quandary. Some in the company management severely disliked and distrusted Ogden, but newly appointed governor George Simpson pushed for his reinstatement, arguing that he had done no more than many others during the &quot;fur-trade wars&quot;. Ogden was admitted to the reconfigured HBC with the rank of Chief Trader in 1823 and put in charge of Spokane House. In November 1824, he was put in charge of the Snake River Country of the HBC&#x27;s Columbia Department Expedition.

Between 1824 and 1830, Ogden led a series of expeditions to explore and trap in the Snake River Country. One of the company&#x27;s objectives was to bring as many furs from this area as possible to the HBC so as to create a &quot;fur desert&quot;, which was intended to discourage inroads by American trappers and traders. The exploration trips included:

*1824–25: Ogden led a fur brigade that expanded HBC&#x27;s influence along the Snake River east to Montana&#x27;s Bitterroot River and south to the Bear River in present-day Utah. During this trip, near modern Mountain Green, Utah, 23 freemen, independent trappers outfitted by HBC, defected with about 700 beaver pelts to Americans operating in the area.
*1825–26: Traveling south from the Columbia River to the Deschutes River in Oregon, Ogden then turned east and traveled through the Blue Mountains to the Snake River.
*1826–27: From Walla Walla, in present-day Washington, an expedition explored the Deschutes River, following it to Klamath Lake and an area near the upper Rogue River and Mount McLoughlin.
*1828–29: Ogden explored the Great Salt Lake and the Weber River drainage, where the Ogden River, and subsequently the current city of Ogden, Utah, is named for him. He explored areas of the Great Basin, finding and following the Humboldt River, later named for German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, west to its dry sink in present-day Nevada. A year earlier, in 1827, American trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith had become the first American to cross the Great Basin in 1827, traversing west to east from the Sierra Nevada near Ebbetts Pass. Smith, however, missed Humboldt Lake and the Humboldt River, and nearly died for lack of food and water. Ogden&#x27;s easier route following the river eventually became part of the California Trail.
*1829–30: Leaving Fort Vancouver on 28 August 1829, Ogden proceeded to Walla Walla, then to the Great Salt Lake, then southwest, probably reaching the Gulf of California. He then went north through California, skirting the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada in order to avoid contact with Mexican authorities. The party arrived at Fort Nez Perce on 30 June and transferred to canoe-like Columbia boats. On 3 July, at The Dalles, nine men plus the wife and two sons of one of the men were drowned when their boat was caught in a whirlpool; also lost were 300 beaver pelts and all papers from the trip, including Ogden&#x27;s journal. Ogden and the other survivors reached Fort Vancouver on 6 July 1830.

In 1830, Ogden was sent north to establish a new HBC post named Fort Simpson near the mouth of the Nass River in British Columbia. He also managed an outpost on the south coast of Alaska. In 1834, he was promoted to Chief Factor, HBC&#x27;s highest field rank, spending 9 years at his new post at Fort St. James in the New Caledonia district of British Columbia, together from 1835 until 1844. In 1844, he took a one year leave of absence, spent predominantly in England. He returned to Lower Canada in 1845, whereupon after a accompanying clandestine survey trip from Lachine to the Columbia district, he arrived in Fort Vancouver and followed his orders to purchase Cape Disappointment for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He administered Fort Vancouver in the late 1840s. There Ogden fought successfully against American fur competition and successfully negotiated with local native tribes, including the Cayuse. In 1847, Ogden averted an Indian war and successfully negotiated for the lives of 49 settlers taken as slaves by the Cayuse and Umatilla Indians after the Whitman massacre.

==Retirement and death==
Ogden retired to Oregon City, Oregon, with one of his several Native American wives. His contact with native tribes led him to write a memoir, &quot;Traits of American Indian Life and Character. By a Fur Trader&quot;. The book was published posthumously in 1855. He died in 1854 and is buried at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City. His fur brigade captain&#x27;s journal for his expedition of 1826-1827 has been published as Peter Skene Ogden, &quot;Snake Country Journal 1826-1827&quot; (London: Hudson&#x27;s Bay Record Society, 1967, vol. 23 ed. K.G. Davies).

<doc id="1186194" wikidata="Q2816456" url="?curid=1186194" title="39th Canadian Parliament">
<text>The 39th Canadian Parliament was in session from April 3, 2006 until September 7, 2008. The membership was set by the 2006 federal election on January 23, 2006, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections. The Parliament was dissolved on September 7, 2008, with an election to determine the membership of the 40th Parliament occurring on October 14, 2008.

There were two sessions of the 39th Parliament:
==Overview==
The 39th Parliament was the longest minority government led by any federal government up to this point, except Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party government in the 14th Parliament, which fluctuated between majority and minority status. No other Conservative minority had previously lasted a full year, and only Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s governments had lasted more than two.

The 39th Parliament was controlled by a Conservative Party minority, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the 28th Canadian Ministry, which assumed power on February 6, 2006. The Official Opposition was the Liberal Party, led first by interim leader Bill Graham, and then by Stéphane Dion for the remainder of the Parliament&#x27;s life.

The Speaker was Liberal Peter Milliken. Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only votes in a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus was effectively reduced by one. This, along with the defection of Wajid Khan to the Conservatives enabled the Conservatives to pass legislation with the cooperation of any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or New Democratic Party (NDP).

The party standings as of the election and as of dissolution on September 7, 2008, are on the table below. Between these events, five members of the House of Commons crossed the floor, one died, twelve resigned, and nine members were elected in by-elections to fill vacancies, leaving four vacancies at dissolution. In that same period, two senators died, six reached the mandatory retirement age of 75, four resigned, and two were appointed to fill vacancies, leaving fifteen vacancies at dissolution. Step-by-step changes are listed in the Members section. See List of Canadian federal electoral districts for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

The Parliament was dissolved by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper on September 7, 2008. The general election for the members of the 40th Parliament of Canada was held on October 14, 2008.
¹Members of the Canadian Senate are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and remain as senators until the age of 75, even if the House of Commons has been dissolved or an election has been called.
²Lillian Dyck was officially designated as affiliated with the New Democratic Party, despite the fact that the party would not accept her affiliation (due to the party&#x27;s position on the Senate). Her official affiliation did not change until October 31, 2006.
³André Arthur, Louise Thibault, Bill Casey.
4 Blair Wilson as a member of Green Party.

==Major events==

===Floor-crossing===
Five members of parliament crossed the floor since the election on January 23, 2006:

On February 6, 2006, David Emerson, elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Vancouver Kingsway, crossed the floor to join Stephen Harper&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of International Trade.

On January 5, 2007, Wajid Khan, elected as the Liberal MP for Mississauga—Streetsville, crossed the floor to join the Conservative Party.

On February 6, 2007, Garth Turner, elected as a Conservative MP for Halton, moved to the Liberal caucus. He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Tory caucus on October 18, 2006.

On June 26, 2007, Joe Comuzzi, elected as a Liberal MP for Thunder Bay—Superior North, moved to the Conservative caucus. He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Liberal caucus on March 21, 2007.

On August 30, 2008, Blair Wilson elected as a Liberal MP for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country, moved to the Green caucus. He had been sitting as an Independent since he resigned from the Liberal caucus on October 28, 2007.

During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then-Prime Minister Paul Martin. After the election results were announced, Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On February 1, 2006, the Liberal Party Caucus chose Bill Graham as parliamentary leader, meaning he served as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons until the election of Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader at the Liberal Party leadership convention, held December 2–3, 2006.

On March 18, 2006 Martin tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.

===Five priorities===

Prime Minister Harper said he would move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign. At least four of these would require legislative action: the passage of a &quot;Federal Accountability Act&quot; in response to the sponsorship scandal; setting longer mandatory sentences; lowering the Goods &amp; Services Tax to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6; and negotiating with the provinces to shorten wait-times (this priority was replaced, post-election, with combating crime by creating more police officers). The child allowance and first GST were in place by July 1, 2006. On December 6, 2006, another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling &quot;on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages.&quot; The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled. (See Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage for more information.) and on January 1, 2008 the second GST reduction came into effect. The Federal Accountability Act received Royal Assent on December 12, 2006

===Resignations and by-elections===
On September 20, 2006 Liberal MP Joe Fontana (London North Centre) resigned to run in the London mayoralty election. Fontana was replaced in the riding by Liberal Glen Pearson after a by-election on November 27, 2006.

Liberal MP Jean Lapierre declared on January 11, 2007 that he would resign from the Liberal Party at the end of the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on January 28, leaving the Outremont district vacant. On July 28, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called by-elections for this and two other Quebec ridings, which were held on September 17, 2007. Newcomer NDP candidate Thomas Mulcair won this riding over star Liberal candidate Jocelyn Coulon, only the second-ever time Outremont has not been won by a Liberal candidate. Mulcair was previously a Provincial Liberal Cabinet Minister in Quebec.

On February 21, 2007, Yvan Loubier (representing Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for the Bloc Québécois) resigned in order to run in the 2007 Quebec general election. Loubier was replaced in a by-election on September 17, 2007, by newcomer Bloc candidate Ève-Mary Thaï Thi Lac.

One day later, on February 22, veteran Liberal MP and former Liberal Party of Canada interim leader Bill Graham announced that he would not seek reelection in the next federal election. On June 19, 2007, Graham announced he would be resigning his Toronto Centre seat effective July 2, 2007, to allow former Ontario New Democratic Party Premier and Liberal Party leadership candidate Bob Rae to run in the riding. Rae went on to win the Liberal stronghold riding in a March 17, 2008 byelection.

On March 8, 2007, Liberal MP Jim Peterson announced that he would not be a candidate in his Willowdale riding in the next federal election. On June 20, 2007, Peterson followed Bill Graham&#x27;s lead and announced his resignation from the House of Commons, effective July 12. Both Bill Graham and Jim Peterson resigned their seats early in the hope that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would be compelled to add those vacant seats to the scheduled September 17, 2007 by-elections in Quebec. On July 23, the Tory government announced that it would delay the Ontario by-elections so as not to overlap with the impending 2007 Ontario general election scheduled for October 10, 2007. When the by-election was eventually held in the riding on March 17, 2008, appointed former Liberal Party leadership candidate Martha Hall Findlay won handily.

Also in March 2007, Bloc Québécois MP and former BQ House Leader Michel Gauthier announced that he would not run in the next federal election. He resigned his seat of Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean on July 29, 2007. Gauthier was replaced in a by-election on September 17, 2007, by newcomer Conservative candidate and former Roberval mayor Denis Lebel.

On July 5, 2007, Liberal MP Stephen Owen announced he would resign his seat of Vancouver Quadra to accept a position at the University of British Columbia, his resignation effective July 27, 2007. Owen was replaced in the riding by former BC Provincial Liberal MLA Joyce Murray, after a by-election on March 17, 2008.

On July 11, 2007, Liberal MP Gary Merasty announced he would resign his Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River seat, due to &quot;family considerations&quot;, effective August 31, 2007. Merasty was replaced in the riding by Conservative newcomer Rob Clarke, after a by-election on March 17, 2008.

On December 12, 2007, Liberal MP Lucienne Robillard announced she would resign her seat of Westmount-Ville-Marie effective January 25, 2008.

On March 14, 2008 Bloc MP Maka Kotto resigned, followed by Liberal MP Brenda Chamberlain resigned on April 7. Another Liberal MP, John Godfrey, resigned on August 1.

==Major bills and motions==
Important business of the 39th Parliament includes the following bills and motions. Note that not all of these bills become law. Motions (excepting those which pass bills) have no effect in law. A complete list of bills of the 39th Parliament is on the Parliament&#x27;s website, divided into bills from the 1st and 2nd sessions. On the site, the bills are divided into government bills, private member&#x27;s bills, and private bills for both the House and the Senate.

===Noteworthy acts passed by 39th Parliament===

====Federal Accountability Act====
Bill C-2, the &quot;Federal Accountability Act&quot; (officially &quot;An Act providing for conflict of interest rules, restrictions on election financing and measures respecting administrative transparency, oversight and accountability&quot;), received Royal Assent in the Senate on December 12, 2006, and is now becoming law. The Act plans to reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; create a five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; provide protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the Auditor General to follow the money spent by the government.

A motion in the House to extend Canada&#x27;s mission in Afghanistan by two years was successful. The motion was supported by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, allowing it to narrowly pass 149–145 on May 17, 2006. Even outside of government bills, the Prime Minister&#x27;s support of Canada&#x27;s action has been a recurring topic, gaining him both supporters and critics among the Canadian population. On March 13, 2008, the mission was further extended until July 2011 by a vote of 197–77, with Conservative and Liberal MPs in favour, and Bloc and NDP MPs opposed.

====Reaffirming the Kyoto Protocol====
A motion passed by the opposition parties (161 for to 115 against) on February 5, 2007 to reaffirm Canada&#x27;s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. The motion may not have any legal effect, but it is related to Bill C-288 – which received Royal Assent on June 22, 2007.

The provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador have already implemented fixed election dates for their own provincial elections. Bill C-16 passed in the House on November 6, 2006 and the Senate on March 28, 2007. The House began discussing the amendments made in the Senate on April 21, 2007.

Among other things, the bill raised the age of consent to 16 from 14, imposed minimum mandatory sentence for crimes involving firearms, instituted a &quot;three-strikes-and-you&#x27;re-out&quot; (also known as a &quot;reverse onus sentencing&quot;) for habitual offenders, and restricted &quot;house arrest&quot; policies for serious offenders.

===Noteworthy motions passed by 39th Parliament===

====Québécois nationhood====
A successful motion in the House to recognise the Québécois as a nation within a united Canada. The motion was put forward by the Prime Minister in reaction to an announced motion by Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe that would recognise Quebec as a nation, but did not contain the words &quot;in Canada&quot;. The motion easily passed 266 to 16, with all party leaders voting in favour, including Duceppe

====Conscientious Objectors to a War Not Sanctioned by UN====

On June 3, 2008, the Parliament of Canada passed a motion (137 to 110) which recommended that the government immediately implement a program which would &quot;allow conscientious objectors…to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations…to…remain in Canada…&quot; The motion gained international attention from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Britain&#x27;s BBC and the New Zealand press.

==== Jordan&#x27;s Principle ====

Private Member&#x27;s Motion 296 which stated &quot;That, in the opinion of the House, the government should immediately adopt a child first principle, based on Jordan&#x27;s Principle, to resolve jurisdictional disputes involving the care of First Nations children.&quot; was passed unanimously in the House of Commons on December 12, 2007.

===Failed acts and motions===

====Re-opening the same-sex marriage debate====

A government motion to reopen the same-sex marriage debate failed. The 38th Canadian Parliament, led by the Liberals, had legalized same-sex marriage a year earlier. Several provinces had legalized same-sex marriage before that. During his campaign, Harper promised a parliamentary vote on reopening the issue. The motion failed 175–123 leaving same-sex marriage legal in Canada and the legal debate about it closed.

====Extending anti-terror laws====
A failed government motion (159 opposed to 124 in favour) to renew certain sunsetted provisions of the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act&quot;, first passed by the Liberals after 9/11 that suspended some civil liberties in order to combat terrorism.

===Acts that died on the Order Paper===

====Eight-year Senate terms====
Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled &quot;An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure)&quot; was a bill to limit new Senators&#x27; tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, senators can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced by the government in the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.

====Senate Appointment Consultations Act====
Bill C-20 (previously Bill C-43), titled &quot;An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate&quot;, was a bill to hold referendums on Senate appointments, introduced December 13, 2006. The bill did not pass by the end of the 1st session of parliament, and was reintroduced in the 2nd session on November 13, 2007. The bill was sent to a legislative committee before second reading on February 13, 2008, but it did not become law before the end of the session.

====Expanding the House of Commons====
Bill C-22 (previously Bill C-56), titled &quot;An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Democratic representation)&quot; was a bill which would add 22 seats to the House of Commons. This would increase the number to 330 seats, although these seats probably will not be in use until at least 2014. Under the proposed plan, Ontario would gain ten seats, British Columbia would get another seven seats, and Alberta would receive another five seats. The bill did not pass by the end of the 1st session of parliament, and was reintroduced in the 2nd session. The bill was delayed by an amendment by the Bloc and did not become law by the end of the session.

====Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006====

Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a long list of minor changes to tax law contained a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not notice the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.

====Bill C-61 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)====

Bill C-61, titled &quot;An Act to amend the Copyright Act&quot;, automatically died before second reading when the 39th Parliament was dissolved prematurely and an election was called by the Governor General Michaëlle Jean at Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s request on September 7, 2008. The controversial bill was tabled in 2008 during the second session of the 39th Canadian Parliament by Minister of Industry Jim Prentice.

<text>Hansa Bryggeri (Hansa Brewery) is the local brewery of Bergen, Norway.
It was established in 1891 by Waldemar Stoud Platou when he acquired the minor local brewery Det Sembske Bryggeri. The name &quot;Hansa&quot; is meant to reflect Bergen&#x27;s history as one of the Hansa trading cities.

The brewery was originally situated in a part of Bergen called Kalfaret, at the foot of mount Fløyen, but relocated to an industrial area outside the city during the 1980s.

Hansa Bryggeri merged with the Østfold-based &quot;Borg Bryggerier&quot; (Borg Breweries) in 1997, which resulted in the creation of the company &quot;Hansa Borg Bryggerier&quot;.

<text>Nicole Stephanie Danielle Lyn (born February 24, 1978) is a Canadian television actress. She is best known for her roles as Susan Kushner in &quot;Ramona&quot; and Emily Roberts on the Canadian teen comedy series &quot;Student Bodies&quot;.

==Early life==
Lyn was born in Brampton, Ontario, to Cheryl Gabay, a Jamaican woman of Afro-Jamaican descent, and Peter Lyn, who is Chinese-Jamaican. She grew up in the Toronto area. As a child, Nicole danced in the National Ballet School&#x27;s Junior Dance division, and was also a member of the Canadian Children&#x27;s Opera Chorus. Nicole entered show business when she was offered a spot on a Jordache billboard after accompanying her aunt, a model, to her audition.

==Career==
She auditioned for and was admitted to Claude Watson School for the Arts at age 10. She worked filming commercials, guest starring roles, and had co-starring role on the Canadian kid-com &quot;Eric&#x27;s World&quot; (1991). She later auditioned for and attended Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts in Toronto from grade 7 - 9, where she was a dance major.

She later moved to Jamaica (where her father resides) in grade 10 and attended Belair High School in Mandeville.

One of her first auditions upon returning to Canada was for the YTV teen sitcom &quot;Student Bodies&quot; (1997), on which she landed a lead role alongside Jamie Elman, Katie Emme McIninch, Ross Hull, Jennifer Finnigan, and Mark Taylor.

Lyn made her acting debut in the television series &quot;Ramona&quot;.

She has made television guest appearances on &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;, &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot;, &quot;My Secret Identity&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;, and &quot;Psych&quot;. She was a series regular in the Canadian television shows &quot;Eric&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Student Bodies&quot;.

Lyn also appeared in the television film, &quot;The Feast Of All Saints&quot; based on an Anne Rice novel of the same name.

Lyn has appeared in television films such as &quot;On Thin Ice: The Tai Babilonia Story&quot; and &quot;Dying To Dance&quot;, and appeared in the feature film &quot;Deliver Us From Eva&quot;.

Lyn also DJs under the name &quot;Ms. Nix&quot; and serves as an announcer on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot;.

==Personal life==
On July 10, 2004, Lyn married Dulé Hill, an actor on &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Psych&quot;. On November 28, 2012, after eight years of marriage, Hill filed for divorce from Lyn, citing irreconcilable differences.

In 2014, she began a relationship with Chad Easterling. She gave birth to her son, Crosby Sparrow Easterling, on June 13, 2018.

<doc id="1186218" wikidata="Q295073" url="?curid=1186218" title="Tite Kubo">
<text>, known professionally as , is a Japanese manga artist and character designer. His manga series &quot;Bleach&quot; (2001–2016) had over 130 million copies in circulation as of 2022.

==Career==
Kubo was born on June 26, 1977, in Hiroshima Prefecture, where his father worked as a town council member. In elementary school, he had already decided to become a manga artist, due to reading the manga &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;. His first one-shot was &quot;Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine&quot;, written for the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1996. He wrote his first manga &quot;Zombiepowder&quot;, which was also published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1999. It ran a short 27 chapters before being canceled in 2000. According to the author&#x27;s commentary, Kubo was in a state of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it. Kubo later stated that he was not used to the magazine weekly serialization and used to pay more attention to his editor&#x27;s comments rather than his own ideas.

His next series, &quot;Bleach&quot;, about Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student who becomes a &quot;shinigami&quot; and fights creatures known as Hollows, began running in the same magazine in 2001. Kubo initially expected the series&#x27; serialization to continue no longer than five years. The original story concept was submitted to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; shortly after the cancellation of &quot;Zombiepowder&quot;, but was rejected. Akira Toriyama, creator of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, saw the story and wrote a letter of encouragement to Kubo. &quot;Bleach&quot; ran for 15 years of serialization and reached over 698 chapters from 2001 to 2016. Additionally, an anime adaptation of the series was broadcast in TV Tokyo for 8 years from 2004 to 2012, spanning over 366 episodes. The manga was named a winner of the Shogakukan Manga Award for its category in 2004. Kubo and Makoto Matsubara have co-authored two novelizations of the &quot;Bleach&quot; series, which were published by Shueisha under their &quot;Jump Books&quot; label. The first was released in Japan on December 16, 2006, followed by a on December 22, 2007, a on December 13, 2008, and a on December 4, 2010. Kubo also appeared in the episode 112 of the Japanese radio program of &quot;Bleach B-Station&quot;. In that program, Kubo was interviewed by Masakazu Morita, voice actor of Ichigo Kurosaki, the main character of &quot;Bleach&quot;, and answered several questions from fans. On July 26, 2008, Kubo went to the United States for the first time and made an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con.

Kubo provided character designs for Madhouse&#x27;s anime adaptations of Ango Sakaguchi&#x27;s &quot;Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita&quot; and Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Thread&quot; and &quot;Hell Screen&quot;, which are parts of the &quot;Aoi Bungaku&quot; series. In 2018, Kubo returned to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and published a one-shot, &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;, in commemoration of the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Later on, in 2020, the one-shot was serialized in the magazine with a seasonal release schedule. The 4-chapter first season was published in August to September 2020. A second season of the series has been announced.

==Style==
Both of Kubo&#x27;s serialized works are shōnen manga with a heavy focus on action. His fight scenes are noted for swift cuts and dramatic angle changes between panels, as well as minimal inclusion of background art or splash pages. As a character designer, Kubo held to a distinctively angular and lanky style through &quot;Zombiepowder&quot; and the early portions of &quot;Bleach&quot;, which filled out somewhat as &quot;Bleach&quot; continued. His designs often incorporate elements of body horror.

==Influences==
Kubo&#x27;s earliest influence is from Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s manga &quot;Gegege no Kitaro&quot;. He remembers trying to sketch its characters and found his own designs to be simpler than that of Mizuki&#x27;s. &quot;Bleach&quot; was first conceived from a desire on Kubo&#x27;s part to draw &quot;shinigami&quot; in kimono, which formed the basis for the design of the Shinigami in the series, and conception of the character Rukia Kuchiki. Kubo has cited influences for elements of &quot;Bleach&quot; ranging from other manga series to music, foreign language, architecture, and film. He attributes his interest in drawing the supernatural and monsters to Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;GeGeGe no Kitaro&quot; and &quot;Bleach&quot;″s focus on interesting weaponry and battle scenes to Masami Kurumada&#x27;s &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, both manga Kubo enjoyed as a boy. Kubo stated that Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; taught him that all villains must be &quot;strong, scary and cool&quot; without exception, and added that to this day no fight scene has shocked him more than Trunks&#x27; first appearance. The action style and storytelling found in &quot;Bleach&quot; are inspired by cinema, though Kubo has not revealed any specific movie as being an influence for fight scenes. Kubo has also stated that he wishes to make &quot;Bleach&quot; an experience that can only be found by reading manga, and dismissed ideas of creating any live-action film adaptations of the series.

In the making of battle scenes, Kubo&#x27;s comments that he imagines the fights with the empty backgrounds and then he tries to find the best angle to make it. Then, he tries to make the injuries look very realistic in order to make the readers feel the character&#x27;s pain. Kubo mentions he sometimes is bored while illustrating them, so he tries to add a few jokes to make it more humorous. When creating characters, Kubo first attempts to create the design and later decide how the character&#x27;s personality will be according to what he drew. Since creating them like this, Kubo considers every character to be unique and wants each of them to be developed along the series. When asked about romantic relationships between certain characters, Kubo answers saying that he does not want to turn the series into a love story since he thinks there are more exciting aspects concerning their personalities. While the Soul Reapers&#x27; attacks and arsenal have Japanese names, other characters from the series also use different languages to describe their terms: German words used for powers from the Quincy and English for the members of X-Cution. In the case of the Hollows and Arrancars, Kubo choose to use Spanish terms about their abilities as he is interested in the Spanish language for sounding &quot;bewitching&quot; and &quot;mellow&quot; from his perspective.

<text>The Strike Fighter Squadron 14 (VFA-14) &quot;Tophatters&quot; are a United States Navy fighter attack squadron based at Naval Air Station Lemoore. They fly the F/A-18E Super Hornet, and are the Navy&#x27;s oldest active squadron, having formed in 1919. Their callsign is &quot;Camelot&quot;, and their tail code is &quot;NG.&quot;

==History==
Since its inception the squadron has flown 23 different type aircraft, had its designation changed fourteen times, operated from 20 different aircraft carriers (and several battleships) and had 92 commanding officers (the 93rd is now in command).

Over the years the squadron has been assigned many different missions, including patrol and observation in its early years, and scouting, attack, fighter, bombing, and forward air control missions when it became associated with carrier-based operations. The squadron adopted the classic Top Hat as its squadron patch and called themselves the &quot;High Hats&quot;.

===Early years===
The squadron began carrier operations on board the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier in 1926. The squadron, then designated Fighter Plane Squadron One, set the record for carrier landings in a single day. Flying the TS-1, they logged 127 traps by the end of flight operations.

In 1929 the squadron was assigned to , where it began as a fighter squadron and transitioned to a bomber squadron. Throughout the 1930s, it flew the Boeing FB-5, Boeing F2B, Boeing F4B, Curtiss F11C Goshawk, Curtiss SBC Helldiver and the SB2U-1 Vindicator. In 1939, while flying the Vindicator, the squadron was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet and .

===1940s===

While on &quot;Ranger&quot;, the squadron provided air support for the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942. During the four days of 8 – 11 November, the pilots destroyed 16 enemy aircraft. Flying the Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber, the squadron participated in Operation Leader, the only American naval air strike against German forces in Norway.

In November 1944, the squadron transferred to the Pacific Fleet, and participated in the Leyte Campaign while attached to . After transferring to , the squadron bombed fortifications on Formosa in January 1945, supported the assault on Iwo Jima in February, participated in the first naval carrier strike on Tokyo, and completed Pacific combat operations with strikes on Okinawa in early March 1945.

After the war&#x27;s end VB-4 made four cruises aboard , including a world cruise between 28 September 1948 and 21 February 1949, after which the squadron was based on the U.S. East Coast. On 15 November 1946 VB-4 became Attack Squadron 1A (VA-1A), and in August 1948 the squadron was again redesignated Attack Squadron 14 (VA-14) and transitioned from the SB2C-5 Helldiver to the F4U-4 Corsair. In December 1949 VA-14 was redesignated Fighter Squadron 14 (VF-14).

===1950s===

In 1951 and 1952 VF-14 made two deployments to the Mediterranean Sea aboard the modernized , still flying the F4U Corsair. In 1953, they deployed in USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42) on another Med cruise with Air Task Group (ATG-201), (which included VF-11, VA-12, VF-13, AND VA-15). In 1954, VF-14 took on the role of all-weather interceptor when they transitioned to the F3D-2 Skyknight, but only made a three-months deployment aboard in late 1954. As the F3D proved unsuitable for carrier operations, the squadron transitioned to the F3H-2N Demon in 1955. VF-14 made two deployments aboard in 1957. The squadron was then re-equipped with F3H-2s. VF-14 and its parent CVG-1 were then reassigned to and made eight deployments to the Mediterranean Sea up to 1969.

===1960s===

In May 1963, the squadron transitioned to the F-4B Phantom II and on 23 January 1964 they became the first Phantom squadron to operate on board &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;. In June 1966, after moving to NAS Oceana, the squadron deployed to the South China Sea to conduct air strikes and support missions against military targets in North Vietnam. During this combat deployment, the squadron flew 1,688 hours on 967 combat sorties and delivered 651,624 pounds of ordnance, in addition to flying its traditional combat air patrol and fighter escort missions. When &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for modernization, CVW-1 and VF-14 were reassigned to in 1969 and stayed with it for nine deployments until 1982.

===1970s===

In January 1974, after four Mediterranean deployments, the squadron transitioned to the Navy&#x27;s newest fighter, the F-14A Tomcat at NAS Miramar and was teamed with VF-32 as the first two Tomcat squadrons to arrive at NAS Oceana. In June 1975 they became the first Atlantic squadron to deploy with the F-14A alongside VF-32 aboard USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. In October 1978, the squadron set an all-time F-14 flight hour record when they flew 977 hours in one month while deployed in the Mediterranean.

In 1976, VF-14 launched the 100th AIM-54 Phoenix missile against a simulated cruise missile at a range of , killing it at a range of from &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. During the same cruise, VF-14 intercepted a Soviet Tu-95 on 21 July. VF-14 escorted the bomber for around 45 minutes, during which the Soviet bomber made two passes over &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;.

===1980s===
In August 1980, the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean Sea on &quot;John F Kennedy&quot;. During this deployment, VF-14 won the Silver Anchor Award and the Battle &quot;E&quot; Award for combat readiness, for the second year in a row. The achievements that contributed to the awards included 3 missile firing exercises with a 100% kill ratio, first East Coast TCS installations and 26,500 accident free flying hours over the space of 8 years.

In June 1982 VF-14 was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing 6 aboard , and in July was named the &quot;Best Fighter Squadron&quot; for its performance in the Fleet Fighter Air Combat Readiness Program (FFARP).

In October and early November 1983 the squadron supported the American-led Invasion of Grenada. Following this, VF-14 proceeded east to the Mediterranean to participate in contingency operations off the coast of Lebanon. In early December 1983, the Tophatters were again called upon to provide combat air support for the elements of the multi-national forces in Beirut.

On 1 April 1985, the squadron returned to &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, where they spent the rest of the year on a turnaround-training schedule, which included eleven detachments to various parts of the United States and Canada. Although again aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, VF-14 was now assigned to Carrier Air Wing 3.

On 18 April 1986, the squadron departed for the Mediterranean once again and were extended on deployment due to the Lebanon hostage crisis. Upon their return to the United States, the squadron was again proclaimed the &quot;Best Fighter Squadron&quot; by winning the 1987 FFARP award.

In 1989, VF-14 was presented with the &quot;Grand Slam&quot; award in recognition of their perfect missile firing record. The squadron entered 1990 conducting workups for deployment and making portcalls in Portland, Mayport, New York City and Boston. During exercises off Puerto Rico, the squadron operated against French Super Étendard and F-8 Crusaders from the .

===1990s===
On 10 August 1990, eight days after the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait, the squadron was ordered to emergency deploy to the Red Sea aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; to take part in Operation Desert Shield. During the months leading up to the war, the squadron assisted in enforcing the Iraqi embargo flying combat air patrol (CAP) and standing alert duty continuously. On the morning of 17 January 1991, the squadron once again flew into combat when they joined United Nations forces in the air assault on Iraq. VF-14 and VF-32 flew CAP and fighter escort missions for CVW-3 strike and support aircraft throughout Desert Storm operating in Western and Central Iraq initially and then conducting long range barrier CAP missions in eastern Iraq near the Iranian border with other Tomcat squadrons from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf that lasted an unprecedented 7–8 hours. After combat operations ended, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; remained briefly in the Red Sea stopping off the coast of Egypt for a portcall before returning to NAS Oceana after eight months at sea.

In December 1991, VF-14 became one of the first squadrons to begin training for the Tomcat&#x27;s new air-to-ground mission. After low altitude flight training and several strike-related schools, the squadron put their new skills to the test during Air Wing work-ups in Fallon, Nevada.

In October 1992, the squadron again headed east for a Mediterranean deployment. Once past the Rock of Gibraltar, VF-14 began flying air superiority and reconnaissance missions in the Adriatic Sea in support of UN policies in the former Yugoslavia. During this deployment, the squadron also participated in several exercises with Egypt, Morocco and Turkey, while continuing to support operations off the coast of the former Yugoslavia and Operation Provide Comfort in Iraq.

In 1995, the squadron was the test bed for the Tomcat air-to-ground rockets program. The squadron was awarded the Fighter Fling Banner Blaster award for their superior performance in the air-to-air gunnery arena.

In late 1995, the squadron was detached from CVW-3 when the Navy began reducing the number of Tomcat squadrons to carrier air wings from two to one and retaining the TARPS-capable squadrons. As a non-TARPS squadron, VF-14 was originally slated for disestablishment and temporarily assigned to Fighter Wing One at NAS Oceana. The following year saw much uncertainty for many Tomcat squadrons, but a grassroots campaign to continue the lineage of the Navy&#x27;s oldest squadron was successful in saving the squadron from extinction and the squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 8, which was losing VF-84, with sister squadron VF-41.

In January 1996, the squadron once again rejoined &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. In March, the squadron deployed on . In June the squadron took a 40-day cruise aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; to Ireland and England. Next, VF-14 visited the Mediterranean and other areas.

During March 1998, VF-14 changed its home to . In 1999, the squadron participated in NATO&#x27;s Operation Allied Force and in Operation Southern Watch. VF-14 dropped more than 395,000 pounds of ordnance on various targets in support of Operation Allied Force, and guided 190 different weapons fired from other aircraft onto targets, including laser guided bombs and laser guided AGM-65 Maverick missiles, scoring a 100% success rate while guiding AGM-65 Maverick missiles

===2000s===

In April 2001, VF-14 embarked on their final F-14 cruise on board , supporting Operation Southern Watch and Operation Enduring Freedom. As the carrier headed for home and on its way to South Africa they were given order to head to the North Persian Gulf after the September 11 attacks. USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;/CVW-8 had been elected to be the night carrier during Operation Enduring Freedom and thus did not see action until 8 October, VF-14 attacked a radar warning installation near Kabul during CVW-8&#x27;s initial strike, which had been envisioned to have a section of F/A-18s, a section of F-14s from VF-14 and an EA-6B from VAQ-141, but due to insufficient fuel available for the Hornets, only the F-14s and the EA-6B pressed on. After their return to the US in November, VF-14 had dropped 173,324 lbs of ordnance (174 laser-guided bombs), VF-14 also buddy-lased 28 AGM-65s and 23 laser-guided bombs.

After their last F-14 cruise VF-14 and VF-41 relocated to NAS Lemoore and began the transition to the F/A-18 Super Hornet switching to CVW-11 and . Both squadrons deployed to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) aboard USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; and prior to arrival in the Persian Gulf, two VF-14 F/A-18Es and two F/A-18Fs (VFA-41) were forward deployed to in late March 2003 to augment its airwing. The Super Hornets were requested to boost the air refueling capabilities of CVW-14 as well as qualified Forward Air Controllers, Airborne (FAC (A)) (the F/A-18Fs). The division of F/A-18s flew from USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; to USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, a trip. On 6 April, the Hornets returned to USS &quot;Nimitz&quot;. During OIF, VFA-14 expended laser-guided bombs, JDAM bombs and AGM-65 missiles and conducted numerous long-range missions to northern Baghdad and Tikrit.

After its OIF cruise in 2003, VFA-14 conducted Air Wing training at NAS Fallon and made the maiden deployment with in 2004, the cruise took them from Virginia to California around South America. After work-ups in 2004 they deployed for a 2005 cruise, supporting OIF and flying over 2,100 sorties and over 4,300 flight hours.

In 2006, VFA-14 made detachments to NAS Fallon and a joint exercise with the Royal Air Force to Scotland. Training continued through 2006 with a Strike Fighter Advance Readiness Program (SFARP) with a three-week detachment to NAS Fallon. VFA-14 and CVW-11 participated in Navy Fleet Week in San Francisco in early October. During this period, two F/A-18Es made a flyover during a San Francisco 49ers football game. Training continued into 2007 in preparation for the up-coming GULF/WESTPAC deployment in support of OIF and OEF, and exercise Valiant Shield near Guam.

On 18 January 2008, it was announced that CVW-11 would deploy on 24 January to the Pacific for a surge-deployment on board &quot;Nimitz&quot;.

During 2009 CVW-11 and the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group conducted several training exercises off the coast of Southern California including composite unit training and joint task force training in anticipation for their 2009–2010 deployment. On 28 July it was reported that CVW-11 and the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group was to depart for a seven-month deployment.

===2010s===

VFA-14 and VFA-41 changed air wings and carriers to CVW-9 and and on 27 July 2011 CVW-9 deployed on board USS &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, counter-piracy and maritime security operations. VFA-14 conducted combat flights in support of Operations Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel over Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The squadron returned to NAS Lemoore, North Island, Point Mugu, and Whidbey Island in May 2019.

===2020s===
VFA-14 participated in dual carrier operations in the South China Sea with the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike, as well as joint exercise Valiant Shield in June 2022, and bilateral exercises Noble Fusion in February and Jungle Warfare in March, both with the Japanese Self-Defense Force, and, most recently, VFA-14 trained alongside 26 participating nations during Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2022 in July. In early August 2024, the squadron was deployed on the USS Abraham Lincoln in response to heightened tensions between Iran and Israel.

<text>Bad Segeberg (; Low German: Sebarg) is a German town of 16,000 inhabitants, located in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, capital of the district (Kreis) Segeberg. It is situated approximately northeast of Hamburg, and west of Lübeck.

It is famous for its annual Karl May Festival, which takes place in the town&#x27;s Kalkberg Stadium, a large amphitheater originally built by the Reich Labour Service into an exploited quarry at the Segeberger Kalkberg.

There is a large television tower in the middle of the town.

==Geography==
Bad Segeberg is not far from the eastern edge of the hills of Ostholstein. The western part of the town is bordered by the Trave, the northern part by the Ihlsee and forests, the northeast is bordered by the Großer Segeberger See, and the west is also bordered by forests. In the south, Bad Segeberg is bordered by the towns of Högersdorf and Klein Gladebrügge.

Geologically, the area around Bad Segeberg is unique because it is the only area with Karst topography in Schleswig-Holstein, which is indicated by the presence of sinkholes in the area. There were even sinkholes in the town itself, although these have all been filled in and are no longer visible. The only exception is the Kleiner Segeberger See, which is a sinkhole that is filled with water at the foot of the Segeberger Kalkberg.

<text>Stanley Philip Smyl (born January 28, 1958) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player. He was selected 40th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft and went on to play his entire NHL career with the team until his retirement in 1991. He featured in the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals with the Canucks.

Smyl was born in Glendon, Alberta, but grew up in nearby St. Paul, Alberta. As a junior, he appeared in three consecutive Memorial Cups with the New Westminster Bruins, winning the championship in 1977 and 1978.

Nicknamed &quot;Steamer&quot; by the Bellingham Blazer fans for his relentless and hard-nosed style of play, he served as captain for a team record eight seasons, later tied by Henrik Sedin. He retired as the Canucks&#x27; all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points – all of which have been since surpassed by Henrik and Daniel Sedin. Smyl&#x27;s number 12 was the first retired number in Canucks&#x27; history, as it was raised to the Pacific Coliseum rafters in 1991. It now hangs with Pavel Bure&#x27;s number 10, Trevor Linden&#x27;s number 16, Markus Näslund&#x27;s number 19, Daniel Sedin&#x27;s number 22, and Henrik Sedin&#x27;s number 33 at Rogers Arena.

The end of his playing career coincided with the beginning of a 13-year coaching career, serving as an assistant with the Canucks and a head coach with the club&#x27;s minor league affiliates: the Syracuse Crunch, Kansas City Blades and Manitoba Moose. Upon being let go as coach of the Moose, he was reassigned to the Canucks&#x27; front office where he has served as director of player development and director of collegiate scouting, before being appointed role as senior advisor on hockey operations. In December 2021, Smyl briefly served as interim general manager of the Canucks after general manager Jim Benning was relieved of his duties.

==Playing career==
===Junior career (1974–78)===
Smyl played Junior A with the Bellingham Blazers of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) for one season in 1974–75. Notching 33 points in 25 playoff games, he led the Blazers to a Fred Page Cup title as league champions in a 4–2 win over the Kelowna Buckaroos. Advancing to a best-of-seven series with the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) champions for a berth in the 1975 Royal Bank Cup, the Blazers lost the Pacific regional title to the Spruce Grove Mets.

Following his playoffs with the Blazers, Smyl debuted at the major junior level with the New Westminster Bruins of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). He appeared in three playoff games, being a part of the Bruins franchise&#x27;s first President&#x27;s Cup as WCHL champions. Joining the Bruins full-time the following season, Smyl put up 74 points in 72 games as the Bruins captured their second consecutive WCHL title. Earning a berth in the 1976 Memorial Cup, they lost the Canadian major junior title to the Hamilton Fincups.

In 1976–77, New Westminster repeated as President&#x27;s Cup champions as Smyl posted 66 points in the regular season, then 13 points in 13 playoff games. Returning to the Memorial Cup, the Bruins won their first major junior title in franchise history. Playing in his third and final major junior season, Smyl recorded a WCJHL career high 76 points over 53 games. In the 1978 WCHL playoffs, he notched 35 points in 20 games, capturing his third consecutive President&#x27;s Cup with the Bruins. At the 1978 Memorial Cup, Smyl was named the tournament MVP and received tournament All-Star Team honours with 14 points in five games. The Bruins became the first team to repeat as Memorial Cup champions in consecutive years as the Bruins won for the second straight year.

===Vancouver Canucks===
====Draft to Stanley Cup run (1978–82)====
After a decorated season with the New Westminster Bruins, his final year of junior, Smyl was a third round, 40th overall selection in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft by the Vancouver Canucks. Smyl entered the NHL with the Canucks the following season in 1978–79. Playing on a line with fellow rookies Thomas Gradin and Curt Fraser, he scored 14 goals and 38 points over 62 games in his first season. He also proved to be physical, earning 89 penalty minutes as well. As the Canucks qualified for the 1979 playoffs as the final seed, Smyl scored his first NHL post-season goal in game one of the preliminary round against the Philadelphia Flyers. Vancouver won the game 3–2, but went on to lose the best-of-three series in three games. Smyl also played three games for the Central Hockey League&#x27;s Dallas Black Hawks during the campaign.

Smyl became a point-per-game player in his second NHL season, leading the Canucks in scoring with 31 goals and 78 points over 77 games in 1979–80. In the second half of the season, he registered a team record point-scoring streak that lasted 12 games (five goals and 22 points) between February 7 and March 4, 1980. The streak broke Dennis Kearns&#x27; 11-game mark, set three years prior in March 1977. Shortly after the streak ended, he notched his first NHL career hat trick against the goaltender Pat Riggin during a game against the Atlanta Flames on March 7. Nearly a month later, he notched four assists in one game – a 5–0 win against the Edmonton Oilers on April 1, 1980.

The following campaign, Smyl was involved in an on-ice incident during a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on March 17, 1981. During the first period, opposing forward Gary Rissling him in the face. Joined by several teammates, Smyl began fighting Rissling. Consequently, Smyl and Rissling both received minor penalties for roughing and major penalties for fighting, while additionally being ejected from the game. A week later, Rissling received a four-game suspension from NHL executive vice president Brian O&#x27;Neill. Smyl was not injured on the play and appeared in all 80 games for the Canucks in 1980–81, notching 25 goals and 63 points.

Early in the 1981–82 season, Smyl recorded a five-point game, notching a hat trick and two assists, in an 8–4 win against the Philadelphia Flyers on October 31, 1981. Late in the campaign, he was named team captain, succeeding defenceman Kevin McCarthy, who had broken his ankle during practice. He went on to complete the campaign with 34 goals and 78 points over 80 games.

Despite finishing the regular season with a losing record, the Canucks embarked on a playoff run to the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup Finals in team history. In the fifth and deciding game of the semi-finals against the Chicago Black Hawks, Smyl notched two goals in a 6–2 win to capture the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl as conference champions, sending the Canucks to the Finals. Facing the New York Islanders, who had finished the regular season 41 points ahead of the Canucks and had won the Stanley Cup the previous two years, they were swept in four games. Smyl scored the Canucks&#x27; only goal in their 3–1 defeat in game four, tying the game at 1–1 in the first period on his own rebound before Mike Bossy scored twice to secure the Islanders&#x27; win. Smyl accumulated 19 points in 18 playoff games, second in team scoring to Thomas Gradin.

====Captaincy and retirement (1982–91)====
During the subsequent off-season, Canucks general manager Harry Neale appointed Smyl as McCarthy&#x27;s permanent successor as team captain. The decision was influenced by the Canucks&#x27; run to the Finals under Smyl&#x27;s captaincy. Neale commented, &quot;We reached a tremendous high last spring under Stan as captain and we feel we want to continue that atmosphere.&quot; Consequently, McCarthy asked to be traded, but remained with the team for one-and-a-half seasons thereafter until he was dealt to the Pittsburgh Penguins in January 1984.

In his first full season as captain, Smyl recorded career highs with 38 goals and 50 assists. In addition to leading the club in scoring for the second time in his career, his 88 points established a club record (it was broken by Patrik Sundström&#x27;s 91 points the following season). Late in the campaign, he recorded the most prolific month by a Canucks player in team history with 31 points (10 goals and 21 assists) over 16 games in March 1983. During that span, he reeled off a 13-game point streak from February 27 to March 23 that included eight goals and 27 points. At 13 games, the streak surpassed the previous team record he set in 1980, but was quickly broken by teammate Darcy Rota six days later with a 14-game scoring streak of his own. Smyl, Rota and Gradin formed a high-scoring top line for Vancouver; all three teammates finished among the league&#x27;s top 30 players in points. Entering the 1983 playoffs, the Canucks attempted to defend their Clarence S. Campbell Bowl of the previous season, but were defeated in four games of a best-of-five series against the Calgary Flames. Smyl helped the Canucks stave off elimination in game three, scoring the game winning goal with 57 seconds to go in regulation, but they were defeated the following game.

The following season in 1983–84, Smyl&#x27;s production dipped to 67 points. Vancouver met the Flames in the first round of the playoffs for the second consecutive year, losing in four games once more. Smyl and the Canucks would not qualify for the playoffs again for five years. He remained in the 60-point range in the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons. On February 27, 1985, Smyl scored his 187th career goal to pass Don Lever as the Canucks&#x27; all-time leading goal-scorer.

Late in the 1985–86 season, Smyl suffered torn knee ligaments due to a blindsiding check from opposing forward Alain Côté during the final minute of a 7–6 win against the Quebec Nordiques on March 26, 1987. He was sidelined for the remainder of the campaign. In the off-season, Smyl was re-signed by the Canucks to a multi-year contract in July 1986.

The following season, the Canucks met the Nordiques in a game on October 13, 1986. Smyl fought Côté during the game, but he was consequently sidelined by re-injuring his knee. Upon returning to the lineup, Smyl was involved in an altercation with Montreal Canadiens forward Stéphane Richer that led to a bench-clearing brawl during a game on November 2. After spearing Richer late in the third period, Canadiens forward Claude Lemieux then sucker-punched Smyl in the head on his way to the bench. A total of 139 penalty minutes were assessed to both teams and the Canadiens went on to win the game 5–3.
Later in the season, Smyl became the Canucks&#x27; all-time leader in regular season games played with 648, passing Harold Snepsts in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers on November 5, 1985. The following month, Smyl became the Canucks all-time points leader on December 14, 1986. Notching his sixth career hat trick against the Chicago Blackhawks, he recorded his 551st career point to pass Thomas Gradin&#x27;s all-time leading mark of 550. A little over a month later, Smyl was awarded the first and only penalty shot of his NHL career during a game against the Calgary Flames on January 16, 1987. Facing goaltender Mike Vernon, he scored to help the Canucks win 9–5. There was speculation at the trade deadline in March 1987 that Smyl would be traded to a playoff contender, as the Canucks were in the midst of another losing season. Smyl responded by asserting that Vancouver was his home and he had no desire to be dealt away. He finished the campaign with 20 goals and 43 points over 66 games in an injury-shortened season. It marked the lowest points total of his career and the start of a decrease in production in the remaining four seasons before his retirement.

After recording eight consecutive 20-plus goal seasons, Smyl&#x27;s production dipped to 12 goals and 37 points over 57 games in 1987–88. Injured during the season, Smyl was temporarily replaced by defenceman Daryl Stanley as team captain in his absence. The following year, Smyl appeared in his last playoffs with the Canucks, as well as his first in five years. The Canucks took the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winner Calgary Flames to seven games in the first round, but lost the deciding game in overtime. Smyl had an opportunity to win the series for Vancouver on a breakaway in overtime, but was stopped by a Mike Vernon glove save. Smyl was held without a point in the series.
In 1989–90, Smyl played his last season as team captain and recorded 16 points in 47 games. He was often a healthy scratch (non-dressing player) and did not score his first goal of the season until the final game on March 31, 1990, a 6–3 win against the Los Angeles Kings (he had not previously scored since April 2, 1989 – the final game of the previous season). At the start of the next season, Smyl resigned his captaincy and it was split throughout the season between Dan Quinn, Doug Lidster and Trevor Linden (the captaincy would be retained by Linden). Smyl had held the position for eight years, the longest tenure among Canucks captains all-time. He scored his last NHL goal on December 5, 1990, against the New Jersey Devils. He played his last game on March 16, 1991, against the New York Islanders. After managing 14 points in 45 games, Smyl retired at the end of the 1990–91 season.

==Legacy and honours==
Smyl retired with Canucks franchise records in every major statistical category with 262 goals, 411 assists and 673 points in 896 games played. He became the first Canucks player to have his jersey number retired as his #12 was raised to the rafters at the Pacific Coliseum on November 3, 1991. In 2000, he was inducted into the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame.

Smyl&#x27;s all-time team records stood for more than a decade until Trevor Linden (who was part of the Canucks tri-captaincy after Smyl resigned the captaincy) overtook them, beginning with his goals mark in 2002–03. The following season in 2003–04, Linden played in his 897th game and recorded his 674th point as a Canuck to surpass Smyl on both marks. Smyl&#x27;s last major mark of assists was passed by Linden on November 8, 2007 and then surpassed by Henrik Sedin in the 2009-10 season. Later Canucks captain Markus Näslund would, in turn, surpass Linden&#x27;s marks in goals and points, but not games. Smyl was later present as Linden&#x27;s retirement ceremony as he joined Smyl as the only two players to have their jersey numbers retired by the Canucks. Näslund joined them in that honour during the 2010–11 season.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics, held in Vancouver, Smyl was named the official ambassador for Molson Canadian Hockey House – a pavilion for hockey fans and players that was temporarily raised in Downtown Vancouver. He also ran a leg with the Olympic torch on the last day of the relay on February 12, 2010.

==International play==
During his final year of junior, Smyl was selected to the Canadian national junior team for the 1978 World Junior Championships, held in Québec, Canada. Playing as the host nation, Canada earned the bronze medal, having finished third in round-robin play. Smyl notched a goal and an assist over six games.

Smyl got his first and only opportunity to represent Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s team in 1985. After the Canucks became the first team eliminated from contention for the 1985 Stanley Cup playoffs, Hockey Canada selected Smyl and four other Canucks – Doug Halward, Doug Lidster, Tony Tanti and Cam Neely – to the national team for the 1985 World Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Facing the Soviet Union in the second game of the final round, Smyl scored the game winner, his only goal of the tournament, for Canada in a 3–1 victory. The win placed Canada in contention for their first gold medal at the World Championships in 24 years. However, they lost the gold medal to Czechoslovakia in a 5–3 loss. Smyl contributed two points in 10 games while playing on a line with Brian MacLellan and Bernie Nicholls.

==Playing style==
Smyl was relatively small for an NHL player at 5 feet and 8 inches. He was known for his two-way play, being responsible on defence, while also producing offensively. He compensated for his size with toughness and relentless checking that made him a fan favourite and earned him the nickname &quot;Steamer&quot;. Smyl was also a strong leader, serving as captain for the Canucks for eight seasons.

==Coaching and front office career==
===Assistant with Vancouver===
When Smyl announced his retirement on July 3, 1991, he was concurrently named a Canucks assistant coach, along with Rick Ley, to Pat Quinn. He was honoured for his playing career, spent entirely with the Canucks, during a pre-game ceremony on November 3. In his third year behind the bench, Smyl was involved in his second Stanley Cup Finals with the Canucks in 1994. Vancouver went to seven games with the New York Rangers, losing 3–2 in the deciding game. Smyl helped coach opposite Rangers assistant coach Colin Campbell, who was also a part of the Canucks&#x27; 1982 Cup run as a player.

Between 1994 and 1999, the Canucks&#x27; head coaching position changed five times. Ley overtook head coaching duties from 1994 to 1996 as Quinn returned to his executive positions as president and general manager. After Ley was fired late in the 1995–96 season, Quinn served as the Canucks&#x27; interim head coach until Tom Renney was hired for the beginning of the 1996–97 season. In turn, Renney was fired after one-and-a-half seasons and replaced by Mike Keenan. Throughout the changes, Smyl remained in his position as assistant under all four head coaches.

===Minor league head coach===
In June 1999, Smyl was named head coach of the Canucks&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. He became the second coach in Crunch history, replacing Jack McIlhargey, who had served for five seasons. He coached the Crunch to a .500 season in his debut behind the bench. In the 2000 off-season, the Canucks signed a two-year affiliation agreement with the Kansas City Blades of the International Hockey League (IHL). Smyl was reassigned to Kansas City, replacing their previous coach Paul MacLean.

When the IHL folded following Smyl&#x27;s first season with the Blades, he was moved back to the AHL, named coach of the Manitoba Moose on June 28, 2001. He coached them to the second round in 2002–03. On March 2, 2004, he notched his 100th win as head coach of the Moose in a 3–0 win over the Milwaukee Admirals. However, as the Moose missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years in 2004, Smyl was dismissed as head coach on June 7, 2004, and reassigned within the Canucks organization. He was replaced by Washington Capitals assistant coach Randy Carlyle. Some Moose players later commented that Carlyle exhibited a stronger presence and was more demanding in comparison to Smyl.

===Canucks front office===
Let go as Moose head coach, Smyl was named the Canucks&#x27; Director of Player Development in the 2004 off-season. Much of his time was spent overseeing the play of prospects within the Canucks&#x27; farm system – for example those playing with the Manitoba Moose of the AHL and Victoria Salmon Kings of the ECHL. He served in that capacity for four years until Mike Gillis took over as Canucks general manager from Dave Nonis after the 2007–08 season. Gillis expanded the Canucks&#x27; player development and scouting departments and assigned Smyl the newly created position as Director of Collegiate Scouting. Former NHL player Dave Gagner assumed Smyl&#x27;s former Director of Player Development role. After one season in that role, Smyl was re-positioned to a role as Senior Advisor to Gillis before the 2008–09 season on September 11, 2008. In his duties as Advisor he still partially oversees collegiate scouting.

On December 5–9, 2021, Smyl briefly served as interim general manager of the Canucks after the firing of Jim Benning.

On October 05, 2023 Smyl announced he was stepping away from his Hockey Operations position after 45 years but is remaining with the club as a community and business ambassador. 

==Personal life==
Smyl left home at 13 years old to pursue his hockey career in British Columbia. His wife was Jennifer Smyl, who passed away in September 2022.

<text>Washim (Vatsagulma) is a city and a Municipal Council in Washim district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Washim is the district headquarters of Washim district.

==History==

Washim was known earlier known as Vatsagulma and it was the capital of the Vatsagulma line of Vakataka dynasty. During British times Washim was bifurcated in into two separated districts namely Akola and Yavatmal. 

=== Divisions ===
The district is divided in two sub divisions and 6 tehsils. The tehsils are below:

* Malegaon
* Mangrulpir
* Karnaja
* Manora
* Washim
* Risod

===Medieval History===
During the middle of the 18th century, Washim was a famous centre of cloth production along with Balapur. It is clearly brought out by one of the articles of the treaty of Kanakpur entered into between Janoji Bhonsle and the Peshwa Madhavrao I after the battle between the two in 1769. The article states that the Bhosle&#x27;s should send annually to the Peshva cloth manufactured at Washim and Balapur worth Rs. 5,000. Mint was also in existence at Washim. The town was looted by the Pindaris in 1809 along with some other places in Berar region.

When in 1768–69, the Peshva attacked the Bhosle, his army had come from Aurangabad through the pass to Washim from which place it moved forward on its expedition. Afterward, it was decided that the Peshva Madhavrav and Janoji Bhosle should meet at Washim and accordingly the terms of the treaty were finalized there and the treaty was signed at Kanakpur. The temple of Balaji at Washim was constructed by Bhavani Kaloo who was the Divan of Sabaji Bhosle.

However, before the establishment of the Vakataka rule with Washim as their capital, the place was an important center from the religious point of view and it even now contains many old temples and tirthas which are revered by the people.

==Demographics==
 India census, Washim had a population of 78,387. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Washim has an average literacy rate of 70%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 76%, and female literacy is 62%. In Washim, 15% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==Civic administration==
The municipal council was established at Washim in 1869 and is now governed under the Maharashtra Municipalities Act, 1965. It covers, according to the Census of 1961, an area of 42.16 square km. The municipal council is composed of 18 members with two seats each being reserved for the scheduled castes and women.

With a view to providing various facilities to the town&#x27;s people, the municipality conducts primary schools and a high school and maintains a dispensary. The underground drainage system is present in the town. Also, there are stone-lined gutters and sewage. The meeting hall of the municipality is used by the town&#x27;s people as a town hall. Protected piped water is supplied to the town, but wells and Ek Burji Dam form the main source of water supply.

==Places of interest==
The antiquity of the town has given rise to a number of objects and places of interest in the town. The chief among them is Padmatirtha, Balaji temple, Rama temple, Madhyameshvara temple, Godeshvara temple, two Jain temples and Narayana Maharaja Temple. The Vatsagulmamahatmya mentions that the town contains 108 holy tanks and tirthas. A few of them can still be identified in the town.

* Kondeshwar Mandir, Kondala Zamare is one of the most famous Shiva Temple, located at Kondala Zamare ( from Washim). Kondeshwar mandir has a rich history and is surrounded by beautiful hills. Mythology detects- Ram, Sita, and Laxman has visited the temple during &#x27;Vanwas&#x27;, there is a place where there are &#x27;Ram-Sita Paduka&#x27; resides. Besides religious importance, Kondeshwar temple is famous for a Kund (A pond about 60 feet deep) that attracts visitors as they can enjoy joyful swimming. Kondeshwar is quite crowded during &#x27;Shravan month&#x27; and &#x27;Mahashivratri&#x27; as devotees across the state visit the temple.
*Padmatirth Washim is known to have had 108 &quot;tirthas&quot;, holy places or sacred springs, associated with different gods and rishis. The Padmatirtha is one of the chief tirthas created by Vishnu. The reference to this tirtha has already occurred in the story connected with the origin of the name of the town, it is situated in the northern quarters of the town. The sides are built up in cut stones. Now the tirtha comprises two &quot;kundas&quot;, a reservoir for rainwater harvesting, one to the north and the other to the south. Recently one Shri Rama-Narayan Toshnival has constructed a small but artistic temple dedicated to Mahadeva in the centre of the kund used formerly by those who entered the tirtha for swimming as their resting place it is a cement concrete construction. An east-west bridge has been put across the tirtha to facilitate the entrance to the temple in the middle of the reservoir. It is said that the colour of the &quot;shalunka&quot;, base of lingam also called parashakti, placed in the temple changes thrice in a day i. e., once in the morning, then in the afternoon and last in the evening. According to the British raj era Land and Revenue Settlement report of 1871, the tank used to supply all the drinking water required by the town but it has since lost its purity and taste. The people use the tirtha for the immersion of bones and ashes of the dead whose last rites are performed on its bank. the tirtha is also used for swimming purposes.
*Balaji Mandir The temple of Balaji is a considerably old temple in the town and was constructed by Bhavani Kaloo who rose to be the divan of Sabaji Bhosle and Janoji Bhosle (king of Nagpur kingdom). He constructed the temple in 1779 AD when he was the Subhedar at the thana of Karanja. The shrine is much revered. The images in the temple of Vyankateshvar Balaji are said to have been buried during Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign to save them from destruction. All trace of them was lost, but in about 1760 a horseman happened casually to turn up a little earth with his stick and perceived a finger of an image. Images of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahadeva, Parvati, Devi, Ganapati, and Naga were taken out. At that time Bhavani Kaloo, who had been patwari of the village Khadi Dhanini in Mangrul tahsil but had become the Divan (or according to some accounts, a general) of the Bhosale Rajas, was at Bashini. He set up the present temple, a fine building standing in a large paved quadrangle, with a well-built veranda for pilgrims to stay, a bhandara for Brahmans to take food and various offices. The work took 12 years but was finished, according to an inscription on a pillar in front, in 1700 Shaka (1776 CE). The Dev Talav or Balaji Talav, a large square tank with stone-built sides, strongly and handsomely finished, and with a Jalakridasthana platform, resting-place for swimmers in the middle of the water body was made at the same time. The chief image is of black stone and sparkles with ornaments; a fine view of the town is to be obtained from the top of the temple gateway, though the staircase is rather abrupt. A dome plated with gold has recently been constructed over the inner chamber of the temple. According to the old Gazetteer &#x27;large jagirs and inaams were given for the support of the temple, the present revenue being Rs. 11,000 from those sources and Rs. 3,000 from kangi offerings. A big fair is held in honor of Balaji, in Ashvina month (September–October). About 12,000 to 15,000 people assemble at the time of the fair.
*Balaji Talav The Deo talav also known as Balaji talav, a large square tank with stone-built sides, strongly and handsomely finished and with a jalakridasthana, resting place for swimmers in the middle, was laid out at the time of the construction of Balaji mandir in 1770 CE. The temple is flanked on one side by the temple of Vyankateshvar Balaji and on the other by that of Ramchandra. The tree plantations by the tile side of the tank have now thoroughly disappeared. During the Ganapati festival, the immersion of the idols takes place in this tank and as a result, this tank is getting silted gradually. However, the tank still stands in good condition.
*Rama Mandir On the other side of the Deo talav is a temple dedicated to Ramchandra, a large enclosed building but not, by any means as fine as the temple of Balaji. it contains images of Lakshmana, Sita, Maruti and Radha-Krishna besides that of Ramchandra. It is said to have been built by one Bhagvandas Maharaj Bairagi about 250 years ago. In front of the temple, has recently been constructed a two-storeyed dharmashala. It is used by the bairagis who visit the temple. Marriage and such other religious functions also take place in this Dharamshala. Ramanavami is celebrated at this temple with great pomp.
*Daridrya Harana Tirtha The Daridrya-Harana Tirtha is said to have been created by Shri Dattatreya. Well built as the tank seems to have been formerly, the steps on only one side are noticeable now. By the side of the tank is a large banyan tree. One anecdote about the tirtha says that king Dashratha of Ayodhya, the father of Rama, killed Shravan by mistake by sitting over this tree.
*Madhyameshvar Mandir was constructed about 5 to 7 years ago. After entering a big audience hall there is an inner chamber where is placed a shalunka of Shiva. At the time of the construction of the temple, some images and inscriptions were excavated at the site. The temple is said to have been constructed at a place where according to the belief of astronomers passes the equator and hence the temple is known as the Madhyameshvara temple.
*Narayana Maharaja Temple has recently been constructed over the samadhi of Narayan Maharaj who stayed at Washim. The image of Narayan Maharaj has been placed over the samadhi. One has to go a few steps below the ground level to reach this shrine. From there another staircase leads to the altar where is placed the image of Shri Dattatreya. The whole construction is of white marble. The temple owns some adjacent land. The audience hall is under construction. Every year a small fair attended by the local populace is held on Datta Jayanti.
*Gondeshvara Temple To the west of the town is the temple of Gondeshvara, much in a dilapidated condition. In the temple, are three images viz., those of Vishnu, his sister, and Lakshmi. By the side of the temple is ample garden land making the whole panorama of the temple extremely beautiful.
*Shringi Rishi To the southeast direction, on the way to Pusad, there is a small town called Ansing which is the corrupt name of Ekshring Shringi Rishi. He was the one who performed Putrakameshti yagnya or the holy pyre for Dasharatha and his wives Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. Then they begot Ram, Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughna. His temple is located in the far east of town.

<doc id="1186237" wikidata="Q1674071" url="?curid=1186237" title="Islam in the Philippines">
<text>[[Islam]] in [[Philippines|the Philippines]] is the second largest religion in the country, and the faith was the first-recorded monotheistic religion in the Philippines. Historically, Islam reached the Philippine archipelago in the 14th century, through contact with Muslim Malay and Arab merchants along Southeast Asian trade networks, in addition to Yemeni missionaries from the tribe of Alawi of Yemen from the Persian Gulf, southern India, and their followers from several sultanates in the wider Malay Archipelago. The first missionaries then followed in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. They facilitated the formation of sultanates and conquests in mainland Mindanao and Sulu. Native Filipinos who converted to Islam came to be known as the Moros while others were known as Bahasapillan Muslims, with Muslim conquest reaching as far as Tondo that was later supplanted by Bruneian Empire vassal-state of Maynila.

Muslim sultanates had already begun expanding in the central Philippines by the 16th century, when the Spanish fleet led by Ferdinand Magellan arrived. The Spanish referred to Muslim inhabitants of the Philippines as &quot;Moros,&quot; after the Muslim &quot;Moors&quot; they had regarded with disdain in Iberia and the Maghreb. The subsequent Spanish conquest led to Catholic Christianity becoming the predominant religion in most of the modern-day Philippines, with Islam becoming a significant minority religion.

In the 21st century, there is some disagreement regarding the size of the Muslim population. The 2020 census conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority found that 6.4% (6,981,710) of Filipinos were Muslims, up from 6.0% (6,064,744) in 2015. However, it was reported in 2004 that some Muslim groups asserted that the proper number was between eight and twelve percent. Presently, the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) estimates Muslims constitute 11% of the total population, attributing the difference to a number of factors.

Most Muslims live in parts of Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu Archipelago – an area known as Bangsamoro or the Moro region. The Bangsamoro region is predominantly Muslim, with 91% of its 4.9 million inhabitants adhering to Islam. Some have migrated into urban and rural areas in different parts of the country. Most Muslim Filipinos practice Sunni Islam according to the Shafi&#x27;i school with the Hanbali (Athari) school in minority.

==History==
In 1380, the Sunni Shaykh Makhdum Karim reached the Sulu Archipelago and Jolo in the Philippines and established Islam in the country through trade in several regions of the island. In 1390, Minangkabau Prince Rajah Baguinda and his followers preached Islam on the islands. The Sheik Karimol Makhdum Mosque was the first mosque established in the Philippines on Simunul in Mindanao in the 14th century.

Subsequent settlements by Indian Muslim missionaries traveling to Malaysia and Indonesia helped strengthen Islam in the Philippines and each settlement was governed by a datu, rajah and sultan. Islam was introduced by Chinese Muslims, Indian Muslims, and Persians. Islamic provinces founded in the Philippines included the Sunni Sultanate of Maguindanao, Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Lanao and other parts of the southern Philippines.

When the Spanish fleet led by Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in the Philippines in 1565, they were met by local datus as they traveled in the islands. Arriving in the Maynila (now the Philippine capital of Manila), a vassal-state of the Sultanate of Brunei, in 1570 they were met by the Muslim rajah, Rajah Sulayman.

By the next century conquests had reached the Sulu islands in the southern tip of the Philippines where the population was Buddhist and Hindu and they took up the task of converting the animistic population to Islam with renewed zeal. By the 15th century, half of Luzon (Northern Philippines) and the islands of Mindanao in the south had become subject to the various Muslim sultanates of Borneo and much of the population in the almost of South were converted to Islam. However, the Visayas was largely dominated by Hindu-Buddhist societies led by rajahs and datus who strongly resisted Islam. One reason could be the economic and political disasters preeuropean Muslim pirates from the Mindanao region brought during raids. These frequent attacks gave way to naming present-day Cebu as then-&quot;Sugbo&quot; or scorched earth which was a defensive technique implemented by the Visayans so the pirates had nothing much to loot.

===Influences of Zheng He&#x27;s voyages===
The Chinese Muslim mariner Zheng He is credited with founding several Chinese Muslim communities during China&#x27;s early Ming dynasty. 

===Bruneian conquest (16th century)===
In the year 1498–99, the Bruneian Empire conducted a series of raids against the natives of the Taytay in Palawan and the island of Mindoro which had been subjugated to the Islamic Bruneian Empire under Sultan Bolkiah.
Furthermore, Sultan Bolkiah&#x27;s victory over Sulu, as well as his marriages to Laila Menchanai the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir al-Ombra (an uncle of Sharifa Mahandun married to Nakhoda Angging or Maharaja Anddin of Sulu), and to the daughter of Datu Kemin, widened Brunei&#x27;s influence in the Philippines.

In Luzon, a new dynasty in Maynila began under a local leader who accepted Islam and became Rajah Salalila who created a union through his marriage to the daughter of Sultan Bolkiah and Puteri Laila Menchanai of Sulu, which established Brunei&#x27;s influence in the region. He also started to established a trading challenge to the already rich House of Lakandula in Tondo. Islam was further strengthened by the arrival of Muslim traders and from Jolo, Mindanao, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

=== Spanish encounter ===
Rajah Sulayman was the Rajah of Maynila, a polity at the mouth of the Pasig River where it meets Manila Bay, at the time the Spanish forces first came to Luzon.

Sulayman resisted the Spanish forces, and thus, along with Rajah Matanda and Lakan Dula, was one of three Rajahs who played significant roles in what was the Spanish conquest of their polities of the Pasig River delta in the early 1570s.

Moro (derived from the Spanish word meaning &quot;Moors&quot;) is the appellation inherited from the Spaniards, for Filipino Muslims of Mindanao. The Spanish distinguished the Moro from the &quot;Indios&quot;, which referred to the Christianised people of Luzon and the Visayas. Islam continued to spread in Mindanao, from centers such as Sulu and Cotabato.

The Muslims seek to establish an independent Islamic province in Mindanao to be named Bangsamoro. The term &quot;Bangsamoro&quot; is a combination of an Old Malay word meaning &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot; with the Spanish word &quot;Moro&quot; which means &quot;Muslim&quot;. A significant Moro Rebellion occurred during the Philippine–American War. Conflicts and rebellion have continued in the Philippines from the pre-colonial period up to the present. Other related issue with the Moro secession is the territorial dispute of eastern Sabah in Malaysia which claimed by the Sultanate of Sulu as their territory.

The Moros have a history of resistance against Spanish, American, and Japanese rule for over 400 years. The violent armed struggle against the Spanish, Americans, Japanese and Filipinos is considered by current Moro (Muslim) leaders as part of the four centuries long &quot;national liberation movement&quot; of the Bangsamoro (Muslim Nation). The 400-year-long resistance against the Japanese, Filipinos, Americans, and Spanish by the Moro/Muslims persisted and morphed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state.

Muslim leaders in Zamboanga petitioned the Ottoman Empire to send a representative to advise them on religious matters. A scholar from the Shaykh al-Islām was sent in response.

===Modern age===

In 2012, research was conducted on various cultural properties in Islamic areas in Mindanao. The research included the &#x27;Maradika&#x27; Qur&#x27;an of Bayang, description of the notes found in the Qur&#x27;an of Bayang, the Qur&#x27;an and Islamic manuscripts of the Sheikh Ahmad Bashir collection, the &#x27;Dibolodan&#x27; Qur&#x27;an of Bacong in Marantao, the Qur&#x27;an and prayer scroll of Guro sa Masiu in Taraka, the &#x27;Story of the Prophet Muhammad&#x27; at the Growing Memorial Research Center of the Dansalan College, and the Islamic Manuscript Art of the Philippines. In 2014, the Maradika Qur&#x27;an of Bayang was declared as a &quot;National Cultural Treasure&quot;, the first Islamic manuscript in the Philippines to be declared as such.

====Bangsa Sug and Bangsa Moro====
In 2018, a unification gathering of all the sultans of the Sulu archipelago and representatives from all ethnic communities in the Sulu archipelago commenced in Zamboanga City, declaring themselves as the &quot;Bangsa Sug&quot; peoples and separating them from the &quot;Bangsa Moro&quot; peoples of mainland central Mindanao. They cited the complete difference in cultures and customary ways of life as the primary reason for their separation from the Muslims of mainland central Mindanao. They also called the government to establish a separate Philippine state, called &quot;Bangsa Sug&quot;, from mainland Bangsa Moro or to incorporate the Sulu archipelago to whatever state is formed in the Zamboanga peninsula, if ever federalism in the Philippines is approved in the coming years.

====Balik Islam====
There is also a growing community of Filipino converts to Islam, known popularly as &quot;Balik Islam&quot; (return or returnees to Islam), often led by former Christian missionary converts.
 At the end of 2014, the NCMF estimated that there were 200,000–2,000,000 Filipinos who had converted to Islam since the 1970s.

==Bangsamoro Region==

Most Muslims in the Philippines live on the island of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and Palawan, also known collectively as MINSUPALA. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is the region of the Philippines that is composed of all the Philippines&#x27; predominantly Muslim provinces, namely: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. It also comprised the cities of Marawi, Lamitan, and Cotabato City and the 63 Barangays in North Cotabato who opted to join the autonomous region. It is the only region that has its own government. The regional capital is at Cotabato City, which is outside the jurisdiction of the former and defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) but is now part of the Bangsamoro region after the majority of the residents voted in favor for their inclusion in the autonomous region in the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law on January 21, 2019.

Other provinces and regions with large Muslim populations as well have a significant history with Moro/Muslims include Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, Bicol Region, Metro Cebu, Eastern Visayas, southern Palawan, Soccsksargen, Lanao del Norte, Davao City and the Zamboanga Peninsula. However, these are not part of the Bangsamoro region.

==Demographics==

The predominantly Muslim ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines are the Iranun, Jama Mapun, Kalagan, Kalibugan, Maguindanao, Maranao, Molbog, Sama (including the Badjao, Balanguingui, and various Tawi-Tawi Sama groups), Sangil, Tausūg, and Yakan. Muslims who were formerly Christians and animists are called the &quot;balik-Islam.&quot;

==Islamic schools of thought in the Philippines==
===Sufism===

Sufism was also brought through travelling merchants and often interspersed with the classical ASWJ. Representatives of this were the &quot;makhdumin&quot;, the first missionaries of Islam in the Philippines. Examples are the Darul Abdulqadir Jilani Dergah in Talon-Talon, Zamboanga City, and the Maharlika Blue Mosque community in Taguig City.

There are already many practitioners of Sufism in the country from different social status. The orders or &quot;tariqas&quot; that are present in the country are: the Naqshbandi Aliya, Naqshbandi Chisti, Qadiri, Rifai, Shattari, Rifai Qadiri Shadhili, Tijani, and Khalwati. The Naqshbandi Aliya tariqa have the most followers, concentrated in Manila, Cebu, Zamboanga, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. There are also Sufis from the students and alumni of known universities, such as the Ateneo de Manila University, the Ateneo de Zamboanga University, and Western Mindanao State University.

====Classical Traditional Southeast Asian Sufism (Sufism)====
Arrived during the early stages of Islam in Southeast Asia, it was brought through travelling merchants and was often interspersed with Sufism. Adherents are required to follow one school of law (&quot;madhhab&quot;) as a guidance in their legal and daily affairs.

Generally, in Southeast Asia, most adherents of the ASWJ follow the Shafi&#x27;i school of law, and the Ash&#x27;ari school of theology. Examples are the Sabiel al-Muhtadien and Darul Makhdumin Madrasah, located in Zamboanga, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

===Shi&#x27;ism===
The first Shi&#x27;as to arrive, together with the Sufis, were the Isma&#x27;ilis and the Kaysaniyyas (earlier offshoots of Shi&#x27;ism), who eventually blended with the orthodox (ASWJ) Muslims. More Shi&#x27;as would later arrive at the height of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Examples are the Masjid Imam Mahdi in Suterville, Zamboanga City, and the Masjid Karbala in Marawi City.

===Indigenous Islam===
Also referred to as, &quot;Ilmu kamaasan&quot;, &quot;Ilmu kamatoahan&quot;, &quot;Ilmu sa Matoah&quot;, and &quot;Ilmu Minatoah&quot; (knowledge of the elders), it is an indigenized amalgamation of Islam from the preceding schools of thought and local cultural customs, this is actually contextualized and simplified according to how the elders have understood Islam and the process of Islamization of the communities. These are normally communities located in far rural areas.

===Salafism===
Also known as the Athari, it is originally a school of thought from the Hanbali madhhab otherwise referred to as Traditionalist theology or Scripturalist theology, it then became the deviated school of Wahhabi Islam which is more puritanical in adherence to the Quran and Sunnah in the way of Salafu As-Salih.

This school of thought is notable for active propagation and conversion of people to Islam (&quot;Balik Islam&quot; phenomenon), marked intolerance for interfaith and intrafaith engagements, Examples of these groups are the Mahad Moro, Mahad Salamat, and Mahad Quran wal Hadith Zamboanga City, the Mercy Foundation in Manila and Davao City, the Al-Maarif Educational Center in Baguio City, and the Jamiatul Waqf al-Islamie, and Jamiato Monib al-Kouzbary al-Arabiyah in Marawi City.

===&quot;Ash&#x27;ari wal Maturidi&quot;===
This is the mainstream Sunni school of Islamic theology, founded by the Arab Muslim scholar, Shāfiʿī jurist, reformer (mujaddid), and scholastic theologian, Abū al-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī in the 9th–10th century, with the Persian Muslim scholar, Ḥanafī jurist, reformer (mujaddid), and scholastic theologian Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī in the 9th–10th century, it established an orthodox guideline based on scriptural authority, rationality, and theological rationalism. It is also a school of theology supporting the use of reason and speculative theology (kalām) to defend the faith.

Almost 95% of Sunni around the world are Ash&#x27;ari and Maturidi. They have a few educational institutions in the country, such as the Jamiatu Al-Hikmah in Mulondo, Lanao del Sur and the Muhajireen wal Ansar Academy in Taguig City as well as the 3 prominent ones namely, Darul Ifta Region 9 and Palawan, Sabiel al-Muhtadien and Darul Makhdumin Madrasah, located in Zamboanga, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

===&quot;Tablighi Jama&#x27;at&quot;===
The &quot;Tablighi Jama&#x27;at&quot; is a revivalist movement originated in South Asia, aiming at revitalizing Muslims’ practice of Islam. Politically neutral and tolerant, they are characterized by &quot;khurūj&quot; (regular traveling from one mosque to another) events to call people back to the mosque and pray, as well as their annual gatherings called &quot;ijtema&#x27;at&quot;. They are the most moderate, apolitical, and pacifist among the different Muslim groups.

Most Filipino &quot;Tablighi Jama&#x27;at&quot; members are Ash&#x27;ari and Maturidi scholars, such as Sheikh Aminollah Mimbala Batua and Mawlana Mahdi Batua, as well as Filipino ASWJ scholars like Mawlana Dr. Abdullatif Cadhe Sirad.

They can be found in many mosques, most prominent is the Jama&#x27;at of Mawlana Mahdi Batua of the Masjid Al-Dahab in Quiapo, Manila.

===&quot;Nurcu&quot;===
&quot;Nurcu&quot; is an Islamic movement calling people back to Islam. The basis of unity of this group is the multi-volume compilation of articles and books called the &quot;Risale-i Nur&quot; (&quot;epistle of light&quot; in Turkish), which is a voluminous commentary on the Quran and Hadith by Bediuzzaman Said Nursî, one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century.

Nursî&#x27;s main theme in his works is answering modern man&#x27;s major crisis – the absence of certainty of Faith. The &quot;Risale-i Nur&quot; is a monumental work that aims to address this. He also said that all suffering in the world is because of three things: ignorance, poverty, and misunderstanding. In his opinion, this can be healed by knowledge, service, and understanding others. This is elucidated in his &quot;magnum opus&quot; as a guide to Muslims.

This group is active in many parts of the country and has trained many educators. Notable among them is the Risale-i Nur Institute in Cagayan de Oro City and their &quot;dershaneler&quot; in different cities across the Philippines. They are also responsible for publishing many Islamic books for use in elementary, junior high, and high schools, as well as universities and colleges. It was tested in the former Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, during the term of then CHED Regional Secretary Norma Sharief.

===&quot;Hizmet&quot;===
It was founded by Turkish scholar Fethullah Gülen. Their principles actually come from the &quot;Risale-i Nur&quot;, except that in the present political context, it has been listed as a terrorist organization by the Turkish government since 2016.

However, it is important to note that the Hizmet movement focuses on the principles of &quot;service to humanity&quot; and &quot;dialogue and cooperation&quot; as mechanisms of understanding others. They are well known to have established several schools in the Philippines and is considered a world standard in science and mathematics education.

===&quot;Ahmadiyya&quot;===
Considered by most Muslim groups as heretics and non-Muslims, Ahmadis (as they call themselves) also believe in the major tenets of Islam, except they believed that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani is the last prophet and the promised &quot;Mahdi&quot; or &quot;messiah&quot;, of which majority of Muslim sects disagree due to the concept about the finality on the Prophethood of Muhammad.

This community consists of expatriates and predominatly Badjaos, who are normally in the lowest social strata in Moro society.

===Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light===
Derived from Shia Islam, the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light (AROPL), also called the Ahmadi Religion (not to be confused with the Sunni- and Sufi-derived messianist sect of Ahmadiyyah), is a messianist syncretic religious movement founded and led by an Egyptian-American religious leader Abdullah Hashem Aba as-Sadiq, a follower of Iraqi Shia Muslim cleric Ahmad al-Hassan, hence the name of the movement. Abdullah Hashem claimed and is believed by his followers to be the al-Qa&#x27;im (the second Mahdi), as Ahmad al-Hassan is the first Mahdi, who is also the key figure of the movement. Having elements of Judaism, Christianity as well as Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and other world religions, many of AROPL&#x27;s doctrines oppose those of traditional Islam, for example, the movement believes that the Kaaba is actually in Petra, Jordan instead of Mecca, Saudi Arabia; hijab and niqab wearing is not mandatory but they are either allowed; and the belief in reincarnation. Unlike also traditional Islam, the movement has its own sacred book called &quot;The Goal of the Wise&quot;, authored by Abdullah Hashem. AROPL&#x27;s headquarters is located in Manchester, United Kingdom.

The religious movement is relatively small, although increasing members are estimated to be less than a thousand followers globally, with at least three or four Filipino converts are reported.

<text>Dale Duesing (born September 26, 1945) is an American baritone. As an opera singer, he has had an international career spanning five decades.

Duesing grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He studied piano throughout childhood, and enrolled at Lawrence University, majoring in piano performance. He switched to vocal performance while in college, and won the Metropolitan Opera Competition in his final year of study. After traveling to Europe with a Fulbright Scholarship, Duesing made a name for himself there.

Duesing has performed at the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, La Scala (as Arlecchino in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, 1984), Vienna State Opera, Paris Opéra, and Covent Garden, among others.

He appeared at the Metropolitan from 1979 to 1989 in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (with Johanna Meier and René Kollo), &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (opposite Rita Shane, then Zdzisława Donat, as the Queen of Night), &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (as Silvio, with Carlo Bergonzi and Cornell MacNeil), &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (directed by John Dexter), &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (a performance later released on Compact Discs), &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (as Ned Keene, opposite Jon Vickers), &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (with Richard Cassilly, in Dexter&#x27;s production), and &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (as Dr Falke).

In 2006 and 2011 Mr. Duesing was seen as the Forester in &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; in The Netherlands.

The baritone has also sung under the direction of Karl Böhm, Leonard Bernstein, James Levine, Carlo Maria Giulini, Edo de Waart, Herbert von Karajan, and Seiji Ozawa.

In 1993, Duesing received a Grammy Award for his 1991 recording of Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;The Lovers&quot; with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and was named the Singer of the Year by &quot;Opernwelt&quot; magazine in 1994. Duesing made his debut as director at Frankfurt Opera with &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot;.

Other of his recordings include &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (conducted by Bernard Haitink, 1986), Hans Zender&#x27;s &quot;Stephen Climax&quot; (with Ronald Hamilton as St Simeon Stylites, 1990), and &quot;La vie avec un idiot&quot; (conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, 1992). On DVD are &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1996) and &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; (2009).

<text>In computer programming, a guard is a Boolean expression that must evaluate to true if the execution of the program is to continue in the branch in question. Regardless of which programming language is used, a guard clause, guard code, or guard statement is a check of integrity preconditions used to avoid errors during execution.

== Uses ==
A typical example is checking that a reference about to be processed is not null, which avoids null-pointer failures.

Other uses include using a Boolean field for idempotence (so subsequent calls are nops), as in the dispose pattern.
public String foo(String username) {
 if (username == null) {
 throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Username is null.&quot;);

 // Rest of the method code follows here...


=== Flatter code with less nesting ===
The guard provides an early exit from a subroutine, and is a commonly used deviation from structured programming, removing one level of nesting and resulting in flatter code: replacing codice_1 with codice_2.

Using guard clauses can be a refactoring technique to improve code. In general, less nesting is good, as it simplifies the code and reduces cognitive burden.

For example, in Python:
# This function has no guard clause
def f_noguard(x):
 if isinstance(x, int):
 #code
 #code
 #code
 return x + 1
 else:
 return None

# Equivalent function with a guard clause. Note that most of the code is less indented, which makes it easier to read and reason about
def f_guard(x):
 if not isinstance(x, int):
 return None
 #code
 #code
 #code
 return x + 1
Another example, written in C:
// This function has no guard clause
int funcNoGuard(int x) {
 if (x &gt;= 0) {
 //code
 //code
 //code
 return x + 1; 
 } else {
 return 0;
}

// Equivalent function with a guard clause
int funcGuard(int x) {
 if (x &lt; 0) {
 return 0;

 //code
 //code
 //code
 return x + 1; 


== Terminology ==
The term is used with specific meaning in APL, Haskell, Clean, Erlang, occam, Promela, OCaml, Swift, Python from version 3.10, and Scala programming languages. In Mathematica, guards are called &quot;constraints&quot;. Guards are the fundamental concept in Guarded Command Language, a language in formal methods. Guards can be used to augment pattern matching with the possibility to skip a pattern even if the structure matches. Boolean expressions in conditional statements usually also fit this definition of a guard although they are called &quot;conditions&quot;.

== Mathematics ==
In the following Haskell example, the guards occur between each pair of &quot;|&quot; and &quot;=&quot;:
f x
 | x &gt; 0 = 1
 | otherwise = 0
This is similar to the respective mathematical notation:

formula_1

In this case the guards are in the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;otherwise&quot; clauses.

== Multiple guards ==
If there are several parallel guards, they are normally tried in a top-to-bottom order, and the branch of the first to pass is chosen. Guards in a list of cases are typically parallel.

However, in Haskell list comprehensions the guards are in series, and if any of them fails, the list element is not produced. This would be the same as combining the separate guards with logical AND, except that there can be other list comprehension clauses among the guards.

==Evolution==
A simple conditional expression, already present in CPL in 1963, has a guard on first sub-expression, and another sub-expression to use in case the first one cannot be used. Some common ways to write this:
 (x&gt;0) -&gt; 1/x; 0
 x&gt;0 ? 1/x : 0

If the second sub-expression can be a further simple conditional expression, we can give more alternatives to try before the last &quot;fall-through&quot;:
 (x&gt;0) -&gt; 1/x; (x&lt;0) -&gt; -1/x; 0

In 1966 ISWIM had a form of conditional expression without an obligatory fall-through case, thus separating guard from the concept of choosing either-or. In the case of ISWIM, if none of the alternatives could be used, the value was to be &quot;undefined&quot;, which was defined to never compute into a value.

KRC, a &quot;miniaturized version&quot; of SASL (1976), was one of the first programming languages to use the term &quot;guard&quot;. Its function definitions could have several clauses, and the one to apply was chosen based on the guards that followed each clause:

 fac n = 1, n = 0
 = n * fac (n-1), n &gt; 0

Use of guard clauses, and the term &quot;guard clause&quot;, dates at least to Smalltalk practice in the 1990s, as codified by Kent Beck.

In 1996, Dyalog APL adopted an alternative pure functional style in which the guard is the only control structure. This example, in APL, computes the parity of the input number:
parity←{
 2∣⍵ : &#x27;odd&#x27;
 &#x27;even&#x27;


==Pattern guard==
In addition to a guard attached to a pattern, pattern guard can refer to the use of pattern matching in the context of a guard. In effect, a match of the pattern is taken to mean pass. This meaning was introduced in a proposal for Haskell by Simon Peyton Jones titled A new view of guards in April 1997 and was used in the implementation of the proposal. The feature provides the ability to use patterns in the guards of a pattern.

An example in extended Haskell:
 clunky env var1 var2
 | Just val1 &lt;- lookup env var1
 , Just val2 &lt;- lookup env var2
 = val1 + val2
 -- ...other equations for clunky...
This would read: &quot;Clunky for an environment and two variables, &quot;in case the lookups of the variables from the environment produce values&quot;, is the sum of the values. ...&quot; As in list comprehensions, the guards are in series, and if any of them fails the branch is not taken.

<text>In the Westminster system of government, the Estimates are an outline of government spending for the following fiscal year presented by the cabinet to parliament. The Estimates are drawn up by bureaucrats in the finance ministry in collaboration with cabinet ministers. They consist of detailed reports on how each department or ministry will spend its money. The estimates are normally introduced in the responsible chamber (the lower house in bicameral parliaments) just prior to the main Budget Day, which gives them time to be analyzed by House committees. Unlike the budget, the estimates contain no references to fiscal policy, long-term goals, or funding. After each section is reviewed by the relevant committee the entire Estimates are voted on as one bill. Defeat on the vote is treated as loss of supply and tantamount to loss of confidence. Unlike tax proposals in the budget, the Estimates are rarely controversial, with most issues being dealt with in committee.

Most of the countries also mandate an update or series of updates to the Estimates to account for changes in the economy or in government policy. In Canada, for instance, this update must be passed in December each year.

<doc id="1186262" wikidata="Q304698" url="?curid=1186262" title="Kraft process">
<text>The kraft process (also known as kraft pulping or sulfate process) is a process for conversion of wood into wood pulp, which consists of almost pure cellulose fibres, the main component of paper. The kraft process involves treatment of wood chips with a hot mixture of water, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and sodium sulfide (Na2S), known as white liquor, that breaks the bonds that link lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. The technology entails several steps, both mechanical and chemical. It is the dominant method for producing paper. In some situations, the process has been controversial because kraft plants can release odorous products and in some situations produce substantial liquid wastes.

The process name is derived from the German word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;strength&quot; in this context, due to the strength of the kraft paper produced using this process.

==History==

A precursor of the kraft process was used during the Napoleonic Wars in England. The kraft process was invented by Carl F. Dahl in 1879 in Danzig, Prussia, Germany. was issued in 1884, and a pulp mill using this technology began in Sweden in 1890. The invention of the recovery boiler by G. H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process. It enabled the recovery and reuse of the inorganic pulping chemicals such that a kraft mill is a nearly closed-cycle process with respect to inorganic chemicals, apart from those used in the bleaching process. For this reason, in the 1940s, the kraft process superseded the sulfite process as the dominant method for producing wood pulp.

==The process==

===Impregnation===
Common wood chips used in pulp production are long and thick. The chips are first wetted and preheated with steam. Cavities inside fresh wood chips are partly filled with liquid and partly with air. The steam treatment causes the air to expand and about 25% of the air to be expelled from the chips. The next step is to saturate the chips with black and white liquor. Air remaining in chips at the beginning of liquor impregnation is trapped within the chips. The impregnation can be done before or after the chips enter the digester and is normally done below . During impregnation, cooking liquors penetrate into the capillary structure of the chips and low temperature chemical reactions with the wood begin. A good impregnation is important to get a homogeneous cook and low rejects. About 40–60% of all alkali consumption, in the continuous process, occurs in the impregnation zone.

===Cooking===
The wood chips are then cooked in pressurized digesters. Some digesters operate in a batch manner and some in a continuous process. Digesters producing 1,000 tonnes or more of pulp per day are common, with the largest producing more than 3,500 tonnes per day. Typically, delignification requires around two hours at . Under digesting conditions, lignin and hemicellulose degrade to give fragments that are soluble in the strongly basic liquid. The solid pulp (about 50% by weight of the dry wood chips) is collected and washed. At this point the pulp is known as &quot;brown stock&quot; because of its color. The combined liquids, known as black liquor (because of its color), contain lignin fragments, carbohydrates from the breakdown of hemicellulose, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate and other inorganic salts.
One of the main chemical reactions that underpin the kraft process is the scission of ether bonds by the nucleophilic sulfide (S2−) or bisulfide (HS−) ions.

===Recovery process===
The excess black liquor contains about 15% solids and is concentrated in a multiple effect evaporator. After the first step the black liquor has about 20–30% solids. At this concentration the rosin soap rises to the surface and is skimmed off. The collected soap is further processed to tall oil. Removal of the soap improves the evaporation operation of the later effects.

The weak black liquor is further evaporated to 65% or even 80% solids (&quot;heavy black liquor&quot;) and burned in the recovery boiler to recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the pulping process. Higher solids in the concentrated black liquor increases the energy and chemical efficiency of the recovery cycle, but also gives higher viscosity and precipitation of solids (plugging and fouling of equipment). During combustion, sodium sulfate is reduced to sodium sulfide by the organic carbon in the mixture:

:1. Na2SO4 + 2 C → Na2S + 2 CO2

This reaction is similar to thermochemical sulfate reduction in geochemistry.

The molten salts (&quot;smelt&quot;) from the recovery boiler are dissolved in a process water known as &quot;weak wash&quot;. This process water, also known as &quot;weak white liquor&quot; is composed of all liquors used to wash lime mud and green liquor precipitates. The resulting solution of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfide is known as &quot;green liquor&quot;. The green liquor&#x27;s eponymous green colour arises from the presence of colloidal iron sulfide. This liquid is then mixed with calcium oxide, which becomes calcium hydroxide in solution, to regenerate the white liquor used in the pulping process through an equilibrium reaction (Na2S is shown since it is part of the green liquor, but does not participate in the reaction):

:2. Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 ←→ 2 NaOH + CaCO3

Calcium carbonate precipitates from the white liquor and is recovered and heated in a lime kiln where it is converted to calcium oxide (lime).

:3. CaCO3 → CaO + CO2

Calcium oxide (lime) is reacted with water to regenerate the calcium hydroxide used in Reaction 2:

:4. CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2

The combination of reactions 1 through 4 form a closed cycle with respect to sodium, sulfur and calcium and is the main concept of the so-called recausticizing process where sodium carbonate is reacted to regenerate sodium hydroxide.

The recovery boiler also generates high pressure steam which is fed to turbogenerators, reducing the steam pressure for the mill use and generating electricity. A modern kraft pulp mill is more than self-sufficient in its electrical generation and normally will provide a net flow of energy which can be used by an associated paper mill or sold to neighboring industries or communities through to the local electrical grid. Additionally, bark and wood residues are often burned in a separate power boiler to generate steam.

Although recovery boilers using G.H. Tomlinson&#x27;s invention have been in general use since the early 1930s, attempts have been made to find a more efficient process for the recovery of cooking chemicals. Weyerhaeuser has operated a Chemrec first generation black liquor entrained flow gasifier successfully at its New Bern plant in North Carolina, while a second generation plant is run in pilot scale at Smurfit Kappa&#x27;s plant in Piteå, Sweden.

An additional technology is employed to lower the use of lime. In &quot;partial borate autocausticizing&quot; (PBAC), boric acid is added which produces sodium borate in place of sodium carbonate.

===Blowing===
The finished cooked wood chips are blown to a collection tank called a blow tank that operates at atmospheric pressure. This releases a lot of steam and volatiles. The volatiles are condensed and collected; in the case of northern softwoods this consists mainly of raw turpentine.

===Screening===
Screening of the pulp after pulping is a process whereby the pulp is separated from large shives, knots, dirt and other debris. The &quot;accept&quot; is the pulp. The material separated from the pulp is called &quot;reject&quot;.

The screening section consists of different types of sieves (screens) and centrifugal cleaning. The sieves are normally set up in a multistage cascade operation because considerable amounts of good fibres can go to the reject stream when trying to achieve maximum purity in the accept flow.

The fiber containing shives and knots are separated from the rest of the reject and reprocessed either in a refiner or is sent back to the digester. The content of knots is typically 0.5–3.0% of the digester output, while the shives content is about 0.1–1.0%.

===Washing===
The brownstock from the blowing goes to the washing stages where the used cooking liquors are separated from the cellulose fibers. Normally a pulp mill has 3-5 washing stages in series. Washing stages are also placed after oxygen delignification and between the bleaching stages as well. Pulp washers use countercurrent flow between the stages such that the pulp moves in the opposite direction to the flow of washing waters. Several processes are involved: thickening / dilution, displacement and diffusion. The dilution factor is the measure of the amount of water used in washing compared with the theoretical amount required to displace the liquor from the thickened pulp. Lower dilution factor reduces energy consumption, while higher dilution factor normally gives cleaner pulp. Thorough washing of the pulp reduces the chemical oxygen demand (COD).

Several types of washing equipment are in use:
* Pressure diffusers
* Atmospheric diffusers
* Vacuum drum washers
* Drum displacers
* Wash presses

===Bleaching===
In a modern mill, brownstock (cellulose fibers containing approximately 5% residual lignin) produced by the pulping is first washed to remove some of the dissolved organic material and then further delignified by a variety of bleaching stages.

In the case of a plant designed to produce pulp to make brown sack paper or linerboard for boxes and packaging, the pulp does not always need to be bleached to a high brightness. Bleaching decreases the mass of pulp produced by about 5%, decreases the strength of the fibers and adds to the cost of manufacture.

===Process chemicals===
Process chemicals are added to improve the production process:
* Impregnation aids. Surfactants may be used to improve impregnation of the wood chips with the cooking liquors.
* Anthraquinone is used as a digester additive. It works as a redox catalyst by oxidizing cellulose and reducing lignin. This protects the cellulose from degradation and makes the lignin more water-soluble.
* An emulsion breaker can be added in the soap separation to speed up and improve the separation of soap from the used cooking liquors by flocculation.
* Defoamers remove foam and speed up the production process. Drainage of washing equipment is improved and gives cleaner pulp.
* Dispersing agents, detackifiers and complexing agents keep the system cleaner and reduce the need for maintenance stops.
* Fixation agents fix finely dispersed potential deposits to the fibers and thereby transport them out of the process.

==Comparison with other pulping processes==
Pulp produced by the kraft process is stronger than that made by other pulping processes and maintains a high effective sulfur ratio (sulfidity), an important determiner of the strength of the paper. Acidic sulfite processes degrade cellulose more than the kraft process, which leads to weaker fibers. Kraft pulping removes most of the lignin present originally in the wood whereas mechanical pulping processes leave most of the lignin in the fibers. The hydrophobic nature of lignin interferes with the formation of the hydrogen bonds between cellulose (and hemicellulose) in the fibers needed for the strength of paper (strength refers to tensile strength and resistance to tearing).

Kraft pulp is darker than other wood pulps, but it can be bleached to make very white pulp. Fully bleached kraft pulp is used to make high-quality paper where strength, whiteness, and resistance to yellowing are important.

The kraft process can use a wider range of fiber sources than most other pulping processes. All types of wood, including very resinous types like southern pine, and non-wood species like bamboo and kenaf can be used in the kraft process.

==Byproducts and emissions==
The main byproducts of kraft pulping are crude sulfate turpentine and tall oil soap. The availability of these is strongly dependent on wood species, growth conditions, storage time of logs and chips, and the mill&#x27;s process. Pines are the most extractive-rich woods. The raw turpentine is volatile and is distilled off the digester, while the raw soap is separated from the spent black liquor by decantation of the soap layer formed on top of the liquor storage tanks. From pines the average yield of turpentine is 5–10 kg/t pulp and of crude tall oil is 30–50 kg/t pulp.

Various byproducts containing hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and other volatile sulfur compounds are the cause of the malodorous air emissions characteristic for pulp mills utilizing the kraft process. The sulfur dioxide emissions of kraft-pulp mills are much lower than those from sulfite mills. In the ambient air outside a typical modern kraft-pulp mill, the sulfur-dioxide odour is perceivable only during disturbance situations, for example when the mill is shut down for a maintenance break, or when an extended power outage occurs. Control of odours is achieved through the collection and burning of these odorous gases in the recovery boiler alongside the black liquor. In modern mills, where well-dried solids are burned in the recovery boiler, hardly any sulfur dioxide leaves the boiler. At high boiler temperatures, the sodium released from the black liquor droplets reacts with sulfur dioxide, thereby effectively scavenging it by forming odourless sodium sulfate crystals.
Pulp mills are almost always located near large bodies of water due to their substantial demand for water. Delignification of chemical pulps releases considerable amounts of organic material into the environment, particularly into rivers or lakes. The wastewater effluent can also be a major source of pollution, containing lignins from the trees, high biological oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), along with alcohols, chlorates, heavy metals, and chelating agents. The process effluents can be treated in a biological effluent treatment plant, which can substantially reduce their toxicity.

<doc id="1186277" wikidata="Q365110" url="?curid=1186277" title="Philo of Larissa">
<text>Philo of [[Larissa]] ( &quot;Philon ho Larissaios&quot;; 159/8–84/3 BC) was a Greek philosopher. It is very probable that his actual name was Philio - with a second iota. He was a pupil of Clitomachus, whom he succeeded as head of the Academy. During the Mithridatic Wars which would see the destruction of the Academy, he travelled to Rome where Cicero heard him lecture. None of his writings survive. He was an Academic sceptic, like Clitomachus and Carneades before him, but he offered a more moderate view of skepticism than that of his teachers, permitting provisional beliefs without certainty.

==Life==
Philo was born in Larissa in 154/3 BC. He moved to Athens where he became a pupil of Clitomachus, whom he succeeded as head of the Third or New Academy in 110–109 BC. According to Sextus Empiricus, he was the founder of a &quot;Fourth Academy&quot;, but other writers refuse to admit the separate existence of more than three academies. He was the teacher of Antiochus of Ascalon who would become his adversary in the Platonist school.

During the Mithridatic wars Philo left Athens and took up his residence in Rome in 88 BC. In Rome he lectured on rhetoric and philosophy, and collected around him many eminent pupils, amongst whom Cicero was the most famous and the most enthusiastic.

Philo was the last undisputed scholarch of the Academy in direct succession from Plato. After his death in 84/3 BC, the Academy seceded into rivalling factions and eventually disappeared until the Neoplatonist revival.

==Philosophy==
None of Philo&#x27;s works are extant; our knowledge of his views is derived from Numenius, Sextus Empiricus and Cicero. In general, his philosophy was a reaction against the Academic skepticism of the Middle and New Academy in favor of the dogmatism of Plato.

He maintained that by means of conceptive notions (&quot;katalêptikê phantasia&quot;) objects could not be comprehended (&quot;akatalêpta&quot;), but were comprehensible according to their nature. How he understood the latter, whether he referred to the evidence and accordance of the sensations which we receive from things, or whether he had returned to the Platonic assumption of an immediate spiritual perception, is not clear. In opposition to his disciple Antiochus, he would not admit a separation of an Old and a New Academy, but would rather find the doubts of scepticism even in Socrates and Plato, and not less perhaps in the New Academy the recognition of truth which burst through its scepticism. At least on the one hand, even though he would not resist the evidence of the sensations, he wished even here to meet with antagonists who would endeavour to refute his positions i.e. he felt the need of subjecting afresh what he had provisionally set down in his own mind as true to the examination of scepticism; and on the other hand, he did not doubt of arriving at a sure conviction respecting the ultimate end of life.

<text>Philo of Byzantium (, &quot;Phílōn ho Byzántios&quot;, ), also known as Philo Mechanicus (Latin for &quot;Philo the Engineer&quot;), was a Greek engineer, physicist and writer on mechanics, who lived during the latter half of the 3rd century BC. Although he was from Byzantium he lived most of his life in Alexandria, Egypt. He was probably younger than Ctesibius, though some place him a century earlier.

==Works==
Philo was the author of a large work, the &quot;Syntaxis&quot; (, &quot;Mēkhanikḗ Sýntaxē&quot;), which contained the following sections:

* Isagoge (, &quot;Eisagōgḗ&quot;) – Introduction (general mathematics)
* Mochlica (, &quot;Mokhliká&quot;) – Leverage (mechanics)
* Limenopoeica (, &quot;Limenopoiiká&quot;) – Harbour Construction
* Belopoeica (, &quot;Belopoiiká&quot;) – Siege Engine Construction
* Pneumatica (, &quot;Pneumatiká&quot;) – Pneumatics
* Automatopoeica (, &quot;Automatopoiētiká&quot;) – Automatons (mechanical toys and diversions)

The military sections &quot;Belopoeica&quot; and &quot;Poliorcetica&quot; are extant in Greek, detailing missiles, the construction of fortresses, provisioning, attack and defence, as are fragments of &quot;Isagoge&quot; and &quot;Automatopoeica&quot; (ed. R. Schone, 1893, with German translation in Hermann August Theodor Köchly&#x27;s &quot;Griechische Kriegsschriftsteller&quot;, vol. i. 1853; E. A. Rochas d&#x27;Aiglun,&quot; Poliorcetique des Grecs&quot;, 1872).

Another portion of the work, on pneumatic engines, has been preserved in the form of a Latin translation () of an Arabic translation (ed. W. Schmidt, with German translation, in the works of Heron of Alexandria, vol. i., in the Teubner series, 1899; with French translation by Rochas, &quot;La Science des philosophes... dans l&#x27;antiquité&quot;, 1882). Further portions probably survive in a derivative form, incorporated into the works of Vitruvius and of Arabic authors.

The Philo line, a geometric construction that can be used to double the cube, is attributed to Philo.

=== Devices ===
According to recent research, a section of Philo&#x27;s &quot;Pneumatics&quot; which so far has been regarded as a later Arabic interpolation, includes the first description of a water mill in history, placing the invention of the water mill in the mid-third century BC by the Greeks.

Philo&#x27;s works also contain the oldest known application of a chain drive in a repeating crossbow. Two flat-linked chains were connected to a windlass, which by winding back and forth would automatically fire the machine&#x27;s arrows until its magazine was empty.

Philo also was the first to describe a gimbal: an eight-sided ink pot that could be turned any way without spilling and expose the ink on top. This was done by the suspension of the inkwell at the centre, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings which remained stationary no matter which way the pot turns.

In his &quot;Pneumatics&quot; (chapter 31) Philo describes an escapement mechanism, the earliest known, as part of a washstand. A counterweighted spoon, supplied by a water tank, tips over in a basin when full releasing a pumice in the process. Once the spoon has emptied, it is pulled up again by the counterweight, closing the door on the pumice by the tightening string. Remarkably, Philo&#x27;s comment that &quot;its construction is similar to that of clocks&quot; indicates that such escapements mechanism were already integrated in ancient water clocks.

He is also credited with the construction of the first thermoscope (or Philo thermometer), an early version of the thermometer.

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, Philo tackled the problem of doubling the cube. The doubling of the cube was necessitated by the following problem: given a catapult, construct a second catapult that is capable of firing a projectile twice as heavy as the projectile of the first catapult. His solution was to find the point of intersection of a rectangular hyperbola and a circle, a solution that is similar to the solution given by Hero of Alexandria several centuries later.

=== Apocrypha ===
A treatise titled &quot;Seven Wonders of the World&quot; (, &quot;Perì tō̂n Heptà Theamátōn&quot;) is sometimes attributed to this Philo but more probably belongs to a different Philo of Byzantium, distinguished as Philo the Paradoxographer, who lived in a much later date, probably the 4th–5th century AD. It is printed in R. Hercher&#x27;s edition of Aelian (Paris: Firmin Didot, 1858); an English translation by Jean Blackwood is included as an appendix in &quot;The Seven Wonders of the World&quot; by Michael Ashley (Glasgow: Fontana Paperbacks, 1980).

<doc id="1186284" wikidata="Q4116056" url="?curid=1186284" title="Islam in Uzbekistan">
<text>Islam is the dominant religion in Uzbekistan. Islamic customs were broadly adopted by the ruling elite, and they began patronage of scholars and conquerors such as Muhammad al-Bukhari, Al-Tirmidhi, Ismail Samani, al-Biruni, Avicenna, Tamerlane, Ulugh Begh, and Babur. Despite its predominance and history, the practice of Islam has been far from monolithic since the establishment of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Many versions of the faith have been practiced in today&#x27;s Republic of Uzbekistan. Most of them stray far from conventional Islamic tradition and law, and practice a far more relaxed approach. Heavily authoritarian interpretations of the Qur’an, including Shariah Law, as seen in parts of the Middle East, are almost unheard of in Uzbekistan. There are also traditions from the Zoroastrian era which are still practiced, before the introduction of Islam to the country.

The Muslim Board of Uzbekistan holds the Mushaf Othmani, the earliest existing copy of the Quran.

== Demographics ==
Almost 90% of the population is Muslim. The CIA Factbook estimates 88%, mostly Sunni. The country is regarded a cultural and religious hub in the Central Asian region.

Another estimate states that Muslims constitute 87% of the population while 9% of the population follow Russian Orthodox Christianity, 4% other religious and non-religious. An estimated 93,000 Jews were once present.

According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, Uzbekistan&#x27;s population is 96.3% Muslim, around 54% identifies as non-denominational Muslim, 18% as Sunni and 1% as Shia. And around 11% say they belong to a Sufi order.

== History ==
=== Medieval Islam ===


Islam was brought to ancestors of modern Uzbeks during the 8th century when the Arabs entered Central Asia. Islam initially took hold in the southern portions of Turkestan and thereafter gradually spread northward. Islam also took root due to the zealous missionary work of the Iranian Samanid rulers as a significant number of Turkic peoples accepted Islam. The territory became a world leading center of science, medicine, philosophy and invention, ushering in the period of the Golden Age of Islam. In the 14th-century, Tamerlane constructed many religious structures, including the Bibi-Khanym Mosque. He also constructed one of his finest buildings at the tomb of Ahmed Yesevi, an influential Turkic Sufi saint who spread Sufism among the nomads. Omar Aqta, Timur&#x27;s court calligrapher, is said to have transcribed the Qur&#x27;an using letters so small that the entire text of the book fit on a signet ring. Omar also is said to have created a Qur&#x27;an so large that a wheelbarrow was required to transport it. Folios of what is probably this larger Qur&#x27;an have been found, written in gold lettering on huge pages. Islam also spread amongst the Uzbeks with the conversion of Uzbeg Khan. Converted to Islam by Ibn Abdul Hamid, a Bukharan sayyid and sheikh of the Yasavi order, Uzbeg Khan promoted Islam amongst the Golden Horde and fostered Muslim missionary work to expand across Central Asia. In the long run, Islam enabled the khan to eliminate interfactional struggles in the Horde and to stabilize state institutions.

Notable scholars from the area today known as Uzbekistan include Imam Bukhari whose book, Sahih Bukhari is regarded by Sunni Muslims as the most authentic of all hadith compilations and the most authoritative book after the Qur&#x27;an. Other Muslim scholars from the region include Imam Tirmidhi and Abu Mansur Maturidi who was one of the pioneers of Islamic Jurisprudence scholars and his two works are considered to be authoritative on the subject. In Samarqand, the development of sciences in the Muslim world greatly prospered, waving the Timurid Renaissance. The work of Ali Qushji (d. 1474), who worked at Samarqand and then Istanbul, is seen as a late example of innovation in Islamic theoretical astronomy and it is believed he may have possibly had some influence on Nicolaus Copernicus due to similar arguments concerning the Earth&#x27;s rotation. The astronomical tradition established by the Maragha school continued at the Ulugh Beg Observatory at Samarqand. Founded by Ulugh Beg in the early 15th century, the observatory made considerable progress in observational astronomy.

=== Under the Russian Empire ===

The immediate founder of Jadidism was Crimean Tatar educator and politician Ismail Gasprinsky, which in 1883 began to publish the newspaper &quot;Translator - Terjiman&quot; in the Crimean Tatar and Russian languages. In the same year he opened the first Jadid school in Bakhchysarai. Gasprinsky paid great attention to the education of women.

On August 15, 1905, the Jadidists of Gasprinsky managed to create &quot;Ittifaq al-Muslimin&quot; (اتفاق المسلمين: &quot;Union of Muslims&quot;), whose first congress was held in Nizhny Novgorod on the steamer &quot;Gustav Struve&quot; and included 150 delegates from Crimea, Transcaucasia, Urals, Turkestan and Siberia. This party was presented in the Russian State Duma. The Samarkand mufti Mahmudhoja Behbudi took an active part in the work of the party. an example of an enlightened ruler was Tamerlane. Another representative of the Ittifak party Musa Bigeyev translated the Koran into Tatar in 1912 for which he received the nickname “Muslim Luther”. Another party representative Abdurashid Ibragimov suggested overcoming the strife between Shiites and Sunnis and suggested focusing on the Japanese Empire. In 1905, an associate of Gasprinsky Nasib-bek Usubbekov created an underground organization Difai in Elizavetpole.

The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 gave a certain impetus to the development of Jadidism and contributed to their final politicization. In 1908, the Jadids began in Orenburg to publish the magazine &quot;Shuro&quot; (شورا, &quot;Council&quot;), where Rizaitdin Fakhretdinov pursued the idea of succession Volga Bulgaria, Golden Horde and Kazan Khanate. In 1917, on the wave of disintegration of the Russian Empire, &quot;Shura-i-Islam&quot; (&quot;Council of Islam&quot;) was formed in Tashkent, and in Kokand was proclaimed the Turkestan Autonomy, a secular Republic. The local version of the Jadidists were the Young Bukharians, who professed similar ideas on the territory of Bukhara Emirate, as well as the Young Khivans in the Khivan Khanate.

In relation to the Soviet regime, the Jadids took a contradictory position. Some entered into an alliance with the Bolsheviks took part in the formation of Central Asian socialist nations (Fayzulla Khodjaev. Abdurauf Fitrat, Sadriddin Aini, Mirzo Mukhiddin Mansurov, Majid Qadiri), and others joined the anti-Soviet Basmachi movement (Usman Khoja).

=== Soviet Era ===
The grand mufti who headed the board met with hundreds of foreign delegations each year in his official capacity, and the board published a journal on Islamic issues, &quot;Muslims of the Soviet East&quot;. However, the Muslims working or participating in any of these organizations were carefully screened for political reliability. Furthermore, as the government ostensibly was promoting Islam with the one hand, it was working hard to eradicate it with the other. The government sponsored official anti-religious campaigns and severe crackdowns on any hint of an Islamic movement or network outside of the control of the state. Many mosques were closed.

=== Post-independence ===
==== 1990s ====

In the early 1990s with the end of Soviet power large groups of Islamic missionaries, mostly from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, came to Uzbekistan to propagate Sufi and Wahhabi interpretations of Islam. In 1992, in the town of Namangan, a group of radical Islamists educated at Islamic universities in Saudi Arabia took control of a government building and demanded that president Karimov declare an Islamic state in Uzbekistan and introduce shari‛a as the only legal system. The regime, however, prevailed, and eventually struck down hard on the Islamic militant groups, leaders of which later fled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and were later killed in fights against coalition forces. In 1992 and 1993 around 50 missionaries from Saudi Arabia were expelled from the country. The Sufi missionaries too were forced to end their activities in the country. For the most part, however, in the years after the independence Uzbekistan saw a resurgence of a traditional form of Islam. According to a public opinion survey conducted in 1994, interest in Islam is growing very rapidly. Very few people in Uzbekistan were interested in a form of Islam that would participate actively in political issues. Thus, the first years of post-Soviet religious freedom seem to have fostered a form of Islam related to the Uzbek population more in traditional and cultural terms than in political ones.

==== 2000s ====
The government is against the Hizb ut-Tahrir and the followers of Said Nursî of Turkey.

The government blames the May 2005 unrest in Uzbekistan on an aim to overthrow the government of Uzbekistan in order to make it a Central Asian theocratic republic. Uzbek President Islam Karimov &quot;placed blame for the unrest on Islamic extremist groups, a label that he has used to describe political opponents in recent years and that his critics say is used as a pretext for maintaining a repressive state.&quot; Hizb ut-Tahrir have denied involvement in the unrest, but expressed sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the unrest, firmly laying blame on the repressive practices and corruption of the government.

==== 2010s ====
After the death of president Karimov there was a significant rise of the Islamic piety among the population in Uzbekistan.

<text>Steven James Zahn ( ; born November 13, 1967), is an American actor. 

In film, Zahn is best known for his lead roles in &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; (1996), &quot;Happy, Texas&quot; (1999), &quot;Joy Ride&quot; (2001), &quot;National Security&quot; (2003), &quot;A Perfect Getaway&quot; (2009), the &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; film series (2010–2012), &quot;Cowboys&quot; (2020), and &quot;LaRoy, Texas&quot; (2023). His notable supporting roles in films include &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998), &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; (1999), &quot;Employee of the Month&quot; (2004), the &quot;Stuart Little&quot; film series (1999–2002), &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; (2001), &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005), &quot;Sahara&quot; (2005), &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; (2006), &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot; (2013), &quot;The Good Dinosaur&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; (2016) and &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (2017).

In television, Zahn is best known for his main cast credits as Davis McAlary in the HBO series &quot;Treme&quot; (2010–2013), Cobi in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Mad Dogs&quot; (2015–2016), Jude Ellis in the ABC science fiction series &quot;The Crossing&quot; (2018), and Mark Mossbacher in season 1 of the HBO anthology series &quot;The White Lotus&quot; (2021).

Zahn received an Independent Spirit Award, several nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Early life==
Zahn was born in Marshall, Minnesota, the son of Carleton Edward Zahn, a Lutheran minister, and Zelda Clair Zahn, a bookstore clerk and later a YMCA administrator. His father is of German and Swedish descent, and his mother is of German ancestry. Zahn spent part of his childhood in Mankato, Minnesota, attending Kennedy Elementary School, and moved to the suburbs of Minneapolis for high school, where he acted in school plays and became a two-time Minnesota state speech champion. Zahn graduated from Robbinsdale Cooper High School in New Hope in 1986, planning to eventually join the United States Marine Corps.
Zahn attended Gustavus Adolphus College for one semester but dropped out after seeing the original West End production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. &quot;I remember sitting through the second act thinking, I&#x27;m as good as that guy standing on the barricade,&quot; Zahn recalled. &quot;I wanted to be part of the circus.&quot; Zahn later enrolled in the Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard University, earning a Master of Fine Arts.

== Career ==
In 1991, Zahn made his professional stage debut in a Minnesota production of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; after falsely claiming to be a member of Actors&#x27; Equity. Zahn&#x27;s fellow actors suggested that Zahn study acting, inspiring him to enroll in American Repertory Theater&#x27;s two-year training program. At A.R.T., Zahn worked with the stage director Andrei Șerban.

In 1991, Zahn formed the Malaparte theater company with a group of actor friends, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard. From 1991 to 1992, Zahn played Hugo Peabody in a national tour of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; starring Tommy Tune, and subsequently appeared in two Off-Broadway plays, &quot;Sophistry&quot; and Eric Bogosian&#x27;s &quot;Suburbia&quot;.

After his breakout film role in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, Zahn quickly gained a reputation for playing amiable stoners, slackers, and sidekicks in films such as &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; (1996), &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998), and &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998). In the 1990s, Zahn was often approached by fans who assumed that he was an archetypal Generation X slacker, which was not the case. Zahn has said, &quot;I&#x27;m the guy who gets up at six without an alarm clock. I was always that guy.&quot;

In 1999, Zahn landed his first starring role in the critically acclaimed indie film &quot;Happy, Texas&quot;, for which he won a Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival. In the wake of &quot;Happy, Texas&quot;, Zahn began playing darker, more nuanced characters. He received Oscar buzz for his role as Drew Barrymore&#x27;s deadbeat ex in &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; (2001), and played investigative journalist Adam Penenberg in &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; (2003). A longtime Werner Herzog fan, Zahn campaigned for the role of Vietnam prisoner of war Duane W. Martin in Herzog&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot;; to prepare for the role, he lost 40 pounds by eating mostly raw food.

Zahn has also worked regularly in television, playing the role of Davis McClary on 36 episodes of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Treme&quot;.

From 2010 to 2012, Zahn portrayed Frank Heffley, the father of Greg Heffley, in the &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; film series.

In 2017, Zahn played Bad Ape in &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot;. He researched the role by watching chimpanzee videos on YouTube, and later said that the motion capture process and lengthy digital takes made Bad Ape &quot;the most challenging acting job I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;.

==Personal life==
Zahn met author and theater artist Robyn Peterman, the daughter of clothier J. Peterman, while they were performing in a national tour of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; in 1991. The couple married in 1994 and have two children. In the 1990s, they bought a cabin in Pennsylvania and then a farm in New Jersey, near the Delaware Water Gap. They next moved to a 36-acre horse farm outside Lexington, Kentucky, where Zahn gardens and raises horses, goats, and sheep. He and his wife also run a local community theater, in which Zahn occasionally performs. He also has a lake cabin near Pine City, Minnesota, where he enjoys tubing and fishing with his children. Zahn is a Lutheran. 

Zahn is a lifelong military history buff and has said that one of his biggest regrets was having turned down a role in the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. In 2007, Zahn was awarded an honorary Ph.D. in Fine Arts from Northern Kentucky University. A University of Kentucky sports fan, Zahn is often seen at games and events.

<doc id="1186297" wikidata="Q141991" url="?curid=1186297" title="Percé, Quebec">
<text>Percé () is a city located on the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, near the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula, in Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec, Canada.

Percé, member of the association of Most Beautiful Villages of Quebec, is mainly a tourist location particularly well known for the attractions of Percé Rock and Bonaventure Island. UNESCO Global Geoparks accredited Percé Geopark in 2018.

In addition to Percé itself, the town&#x27;s territory also includes the communities of Barachois, Belle-Anse, Bougainville, Bridgeville, Cap-d&#x27;Espoir, Cannes-de-Roches, Coin-du-Banc, L&#x27;Anse-à-Beaufils, Pointe-Saint-Pierre, Rameau, Saint-Georges-de-Malbaie, and Val-d&#x27;Espoir.

Percé is the seat of the judicial district of Gaspé. Within the territory of the city, the Railway station is also called Percé.

==History==

The area was within the traditional homelands of the Mi&#x27;kmaq people, who called the place &quot;Sigsôg&quot; (&quot;steep rocks&quot; or &quot;crags&quot;) and &quot;Pelseg&quot; (&quot;fishing place&quot;). In 1603, Samuel de Champlain visited the area and named the famous rock &quot;Isle Percée&quot; (&quot;Pierced Island&quot;). During the 17th century, the place was used primarily as a stop-over for ships travelling to Quebec.
Used as a seasonal fishing centre during the New France era, permanent settlement began in the early 19th century with the arrival of Irish, French Canadian, and Jersey natives. In 1801 the Parish of Saint-Michel-de-Percé was founded. Percé became the most important fishing location on the Gaspé Peninsula after Charles Robin, a native of Jersey, began his fishing establishment. Old buildings of the Charles Robin Company can still be seen there.

In 1842, the geographic township of Percé was formed, and 3 years later, the place was incorporated as a township municipality. In 1847, it was abolished, but on July 1, 1855, it was reestablished. On February 24, 1868, the Township Municipality of Percé was dissolved and split into the Municipality of Anse-du-Cap and the Municipality of Percé.

In 1942, the Royal Canadian Navy made a decision to expand Direction Finding and wireless intercept at Cap D&#x27;Espoir to a 24-hour basis in order to provide more bearings on German U-boats and to intercept enemy radio traffic. The Department of Transport placed its facilities at the disposal of the RCN. On May 21/45, the Canadian Naval Service approved the closing down and disposal of Harbour Grace and Cap D&#x27;Espoir intercept stations.

In 1971, Percé was greatly expanded and gained &quot;ville&quot; (town) status when it amalgamated with these 5 surrounding municipalities (with year of original incorporation):
* Municipality of Barachois (1953)
* Municipality of Bridgeville (1933)
* Municipality of Cap-d&#x27;Espoir (1935)
* Municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-la-Malbaie N°1 (1876)
* Municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-la-Malbaie N°2 (1876)

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Percé had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==
The main sector of economic activity is tourism due to the presence of Percé Rock as well as Bonaventure Island and its northern gannets. It was calculated that 60,000 visitors per year walked at the foot of the rock. However, it is now not recommended for visitors to approach within 500 meters of it due to the risk of landslides.

The two main attractions of the city of Percé are:
* The Île-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Percé National Park
* The Percé UNESCO Global Geopark

Percé has a strong tourist positioning in Quebec and internationally and is a driving force in the tourism industry for the Gaspé Peninsula. It is an icon of the tourism industry in Quebec and Canada. The efforts made in recent years have helped stimulate and diversify its economy through tourism, the city&#x27;s main economic activity niche.

With more than 500,000 visitors per year, the town of Percé plays an important role in the Quebec tourist economy, and has been rewarded for its undeniable quality of life.

==Arts and culture==
Les Percéides, an annual film festival in Percé, screens a weeklong series of films at various venues in the town, climaxing in an outdoor gala screening on the public beach.

==Attractions==

Percé Rock is a natural rock formation located close to the shore facing the town. It is a natural tourist attraction for its size, colour, and unusual door-like hole at one end of the rock. It can be seen from any of the belvederes in the area including Mont Joli, Mont Sainte-Anne and Pic de l&#x27;Aurore. Tourists can walk up to the hole in the rock at low tide.

Bonaventure Island occupies an area of 4.16 square km facing the town of Percé. It is populated by one of the most important gannet colonies in the world and many other species of birds such as puffins, cormorants and murres also use the island as a home and breeding ground.

Whale watching is also a popular attraction in local area, and most notably, North Atlantic right whales, one of the rarest whales, had begun to concentrate off Percé in 1995 (this species was used to be regarded as sporadic visitors into the Gulf of St. Lawrence until 1994, and gradual increases have been confirmed in the entire St. Lawrence since 1998), and Gaspe Peninsula has become the centre of sightings in St. Lawrence region.

Further inland from Percé lies Mount Blanc which has a deep crevasse, as well as many other belvederes that overlook Cannes-de-Roches. Mount Sainte-Anne, with a height of 375 metres, provides views of the sea and, during times of good visibility, Miscou Island in New Brunswick can be seen.

==Government==
List of former mayors:

* Georges Mamelonet (2003–2008)
* Denis Cain (2009–2009)
* Bruno Cloutier (2009–2013)
* André Boudreau (2013–2017)
* Cathy Poirier (2017–present)

==Infrastructure==

Percé can be accessed via Route 132, coming either from the north or the south. It is also reachable by air from the nearby Du Rocher-Percé Airport via private or charter aircraft - there is no scheduled air service to this airport. There was a rail link to Montreal, but that service was suspended in 2013, and there has been no indication of a resumption.

Behind the St. Michael&#x27;s Church of Percé, walking trails lead up past lookouts to the summit of Mont Saint-Anne of , the Grotto of Mother Mary with a waterfall and Crevasse. Another high hill, Mont-Blanc, has views of the region.

In the coastal waters, visitors can observe various species of marine mammals, such as seals and whales. The region is home to thousands of marine birds, which crowd the rocks of the Parc national de l&#x27;Ile-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Percé facing of the town, just 3.2 kilometres off the coast of Percé.

<doc id="1186307" wikidata="Q373328" url="?curid=1186307" title="Islam in Turkmenistan">
<text>According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 93.1% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s population is Muslim. Traditionally, the Turkmen of Turkmenistan, like their kin in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan are Sunni Muslims. Shia Muslims, the other main branch of Islam, are not numerous in Turkmenistan, and the Shia religious practices of the Azerbaijani and Kurdish minorities are not politicized. The great majority of Turkmen readily identify themselves as Muslims and acknowledge Islam as an integral part of their cultural heritage, but some support a revival of the religion&#x27;s status primarily as an element of national revival.

== History and structure ==

Islam was introduced to Turkmenistan during the period of Islamic conquest by the second and third Rashidun Caliphs, Umar and Uthman.

Integrated within the Turkmen tribal structure is the &quot;holy&quot; tribe called övlat. Ethnographers consider the övlat, of which six are active, as a revitalized form of the ancestor cult injected with Sufism. According to their genealogies, each tribe descends from Muhammad through one of the Four Caliphs. Because of their belief in the sacred origin and spiritual powers of the övlat representatives, Turkmen accord these tribes a special, holy status. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the övlat tribes became dispersed in small, compact groups in Turkmenistan. They attended and conferred blessings on all important communal and life-cycle events, and also acted as mediators between clans and tribes. The institution of the övlat retains some authority today. Many of the Turkmen who are revered for their spiritual powers trace their lineage to an övlat, and it is not uncommon, especially in rural areas, for such individuals to be present at life-cycle and other communal celebrations.

=== Islam in the Soviet Era ===

In the Soviet era, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and &quot;vestiges of the past.&quot; Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia with headquarters in Tashkent was established during World War II to supervise Islam in Central Asia. For the most part, the Muslim Board functioned as an instrument of propaganda whose activities did little to enhance the Muslim cause. Atheist indoctrination stifled religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male circumcision, continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in &quot;folk form&quot; as a kind of unofficial Islam not sanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.

== Religion after independence ==

The current government oversees official Islam through a structure inherited from the Soviet period. Turkmenistan&#x27;s Muslim Religious Board, together with that of Uzbekistan, constitutes the Muslim Religious Board of Mavarannahr. The Mavarannahr Board is based in Tashkent and exerts considerable influence in appointments of religious leaders in Turkmenistan. The governing body of Islamic judges (&quot;Kaziat&quot;) is registered with Turkmenistan&#x27;s Ministry of Justice, and a council of religious affairs under the Cabinet of Ministers monitors the activities of clergy. Individuals who wish to become members of the official clergy must attend official religious institutions; a few, however, may prove their qualifications simply by taking an examination.

Some Turkmen do not regularly attend mosque services or publicly demonstrate adherence, except through participation in officially sanctioned national traditions associated with Islam on a popular level, including life-cycle events such as weddings, burials, and pilgrimages. Since 1990, efforts have been made to regain some of the cultural heritage lost under Soviet rule. President Saparmurat Niyazov has ordered that basic Islamic principles be taught in public schools. More religious institutions, including religious schools and mosques, have appeared including those built with the support of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Turkey. Religious classes are held in both schools and mosques, with instruction in Arabic, the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith, and history of Islam.

Turkmenistan&#x27;s government stresses its secular nature and its support of freedom of religious belief, as embodied in the 1991 Law on Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Organizations in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic and institutionalized in the 1992 constitution. That document guarantees the separation of church and state; it also removes any legal basis for Islam to play a role in political life by prohibiting proselytizing, the dissemination of &quot;unofficial&quot; religious literature, discrimination based on religion, and the formation of religious political parties. In addition, the government reserves the right to appoint and dismiss anyone who teaches religious matters or who is a member of the clergy. Since independence, the Islamic leadership in Turkmenistan has been more assertive, but in large part it still responds to government control. The official governing body of religious judges gave its official support to President Niyazov in the June 1992 elections.

Some Muslim leaders are opposed to the secular form of government, especially one controlled by former Communists. Some official leaders and teachers working outside the official structure have vowed to increase the population&#x27;s knowledge of Islam, its role in society, and broaden adherence to its tenets. Alarmed that such activism may alienate Orthodox Slavs, the government has drawn up plans to elevate the council of religious affairs to ministry status in an effort to regulate religious activities more tightly.

<text>Christopher St John Sprigg (20 October 1907 – 12 February 1937), best known by his pseudonym Christopher Caudwell, was an English Marxist writer, literary critic, intellectual and activist.

==Life==
Christopher St John Sprigg was born into a Roman Catholic family, in Putney, London, on 20 October 1907. He was educated at the Benedictine Ealing Priory School, but left school at the age of 15 and worked first as a cub reporter at the &quot;Yorkshire Observer&quot;, where his father was literary editor, and then as editor of &quot;British Malaya&quot;.

Two years later his founded an aeronautical publishing company with his brother. He also published on automobiles and he designed a infinitely variable gear. He continued scientific studies and published &quot;The Crisis of Physics&quot; in 1936.

Caudwell became interested in Marxism in 1934 and began to study it with &quot;extraordinary intensity&quot;. In the summer of 1935, he wrote his first Marxist book entitled &quot;Illusion and Reality: A Study of the Sources of Poetry&quot;, which was published by Macmillan. Following the completion of his book he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain.

==Death and legacy==
According to the socialist magazine &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, Caudwell on 12 February 1937 &quot;was killed by fascists in the valley of Jarama during the Spanish Civil War. He died at a machine gun post, guarding the retreat of his comrades in the British Battalion of the International Brigade&quot;.

The Marxist historian E. P. Thompson wrote of Caudwell, &quot;It is not difficult to see Caudwell as a phenomenon – as an extraordinary shooting-star crossing England’s empirical night – as a premonitory sign of a more sophisticated Marxism whose true annunciation was delayed until the Sixties&quot;. The Marxist academic John Bellamy Foster similarly credited Caudwell with &quot;breathtaking intellectual achievements in a brief period of time&quot;.

In his 1942 introduction to &quot;The Fury of the Living&quot;, a collection of poems by John Singer, Hugh MacDiarmid called Caudwell (along with John Cornford, another young writer killed fighting in Spain), one of the &quot;few inspiring exceptions&quot; from the &quot;leftist poets of the comfortable classes&quot;.

In 1949, The Bodley Head also published the posthumously discovered manuscript of &quot;Further Studies in a Dying Culture,&quot; which included a preface by Edgell Rickword. His earlier (1938) book &quot;Studies in a Dying Culture,&quot; also published by The Bodley Head, was introduced by John Strachey. Both were published posthumously by Monthly Review.

<text>Philippe de Noailles, comte de Noailles and later prince de Poix, duc de Mouchy, and duc de Poix &quot;à brevêt&quot; (27 December 1715 in Paris27 June 1794 in Paris), was a younger brother of Louis de Noailles, and a more distinguished soldier than his brother. He was the son of Françoise Charlotte d&#x27;Aubigné, niece of Madame de Maintenon.

==Life==
He served at Minden and in other campaigns, and was made a marshal of France in 1775, on the same day as his brother. He was long in great favour at court, and his wife, Anne d&#x27;Arpajon, Comtesse de Noailles, was first lady of honour to Marie Antoinette, and was nicknamed by her Madame Etiquette. This court favor brought down punishment in the days of the French Revolution, and the old marshal, his sister, his wife, daughter-in-law and granddaughter were all guillotined on 27 June 1794. Twenty-five days later, the widow, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter of the 4th Duc de Noailles were also guillotined.

The Comte de Noailles received the Spanish title of Prince de Poix in 1729, and that of Duque de Mouchy with Grandeeship attached in 1747. In 1767, he received the additional French title of Duc de Poix &quot;à brevêt.&quot; The title of Prince de Poix passed to his son, Charles-Adrien, as a courtesy title on the latter&#x27;s birth in 1747, and after the child&#x27;s death later that year and the infant deaths of two more sons, came to rest on Noailles&#x27;s successor, Philippe-Louis-Marc-Antoine.

Two of de Noailles&#x27;s three surviving sons, Philippe-Louis-Marc-Antoine and Louis-Marie, were members of the National Constituent Assembly; Louis-Marie&#x27;s wife died with his parents.

<doc id="1186316" wikidata="Q82373" url="?curid=1186316" title="Islam in Uganda">
<text>Uganda is an overwhelmingly Christian majority country, with Islam being the second most widely professed faith. According to the 2014 National Census, Islam in Uganda was practised by 14 percent of the population. The Pew Research Center in 2014, however, estimated that 11.5 percent of Ugandans were Muslim, compared to 35.2 percent of Tanzanians, 9.7 percent of Kenyans, 6.2 percent of South Sudanese, 2.8 percent of Burundians, and 1.8 percent of Rwandans. The vast majority of Muslims in Uganda are Sunni. Small Shia and Ahmadi minorities are also present.

The Iganga District in the east of Uganda had the highest percentage of Muslims according to a 2009 published report.

==History==
The presence of Islam in Uganda was first recorded in 1844 when an Arab trader preached to Suuna II, the ruler of the Kingdom of Buganda in central Uganda. Islam was also spread throughout Uganda by Muslim colonial administrators who originally worked in northern Uganda when it was by controlled by the Khedivate of Egypt but were later employed by British colonial administrator Frederick Lugard when Egyptian control collapsed in the south. Despite persecution by the British, Islam flourished in the colonial period and was said to be fastest growing religion in Uganda by a colonial officer in the 1950s. Mosques were built in almost every established city in Uganda and the Uganda Muslim Education Association, founded by prince Badru Kakungulu with help by Asian Muslims, built hundreds of primary schools through introducing western educational curriculum into madrasah schools across the country.

==2002 census==
The 2002 national census recorded that Muslims represented 12.1 percent of the population.

=== Geographical distribution ===
Yumbe District is the only district with a Muslim-majority (76%). Muslims form a significant minority in the districts of Mayuge (36%) and Iganga (34%).

<doc id="1186329" wikidata="Q2748637" url="?curid=1186329" title="Islam in Kazakhstan">
<text>Islam is the largest religion practiced in Kazakhstan, with estimates of about 74% of the country&#x27;s population being Muslim. Ethnic Kazakhs are predominantly Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school. There are also small numbers of Shias. Geographically speaking, Kazakhstan is the northernmost Muslim-majority country in the world, and the largest in terms of land area. Kazakhs make up over half of the total population, and other ethnic groups of Muslim background include Uzbeks, Uyghurs and Tatars. Islam first arrived on the southern edges of the region in the 8th century from Arabs. According to the Constitution, The Republic of Kazakhstan proclaims itself as a democratic, secular, legal and social state whose highest values are a person, his life, rights, and freedoms.

Although Kazakhs identify with their Muslim heritage, religious practices are generally very moderate, and displays of religiosity, such as the wearing of the headscarf or daily attendance in mosques, are rare.

According to a survey by Central Asian Affairs, Kazakhs who self-identify as Muslims rose from 79% in 2007 to 93% in 2012, however the share of people praying daily and attending mosque weekly were found to have declined during the same period, from 22.94% to 18.20%. According to another study in 2012, 10% of the Kazakhs practice Islam in its totality and stated youth were frequenting mosques more often.&quot; In 2019, there were 2500 mosques in the country, a number which increased 37-fold since the fall of the Soviet Union.&quot;

==History==

Islam was first brought to the southern fringes of modern day Kazakhstan in 8th century, when the Arabs arrived in southern parts of Central Asia. Then it gradually spread across the Kazakh Steppe over following centuries.

The initial push to spread was given by the Battle of Talas in 751 AD, where nomads of Karluk Yabghu state allied themselves with Abbasid Arabs to stop the Chinese Tan dynasty advance. 
Following years, Islam took hold in the southern portions of Turkestan and thereafter gradually spread northward. Islam also took root due to zealous subjugation from Samanid rulers, notably in areas surrounding Taraz where a significant number of indigenous people converted to Islam.
In 1000s, Khoja Ahmad Yasawi, a Turkic poet and religions leader of Sufi Order made a big impact in spreading Islam among both sedentary and nomadic peoples of Central Asia, by writing in Middle Turkic language. He was widely regarded as one of the great spiritual leaders of the region. Which lead Timur to erect a Mausoleum in his name several centuries later.
During Golden Horde period, the first ruler to convert to Islam was Berke Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan. 
However Berke did not promote it to his subordinates. 
Only in 1321, ruler of the Horde - Özbeg Khan publicly converts to Islam by Ibn Abdul Hamid, a Sunni Sufi Bukharan sayyid and sheikh of the Yassawi order. Further he makes the Islam official religion of the state, and starts promoting it among his subordinates.
From that point on, all of the khans adopt Islamic names following Turco-Mongol tradition.
Following centuries, after dissolution of Golden Horde, all khans of Kazakh Khanate being from Jochi lineage would continue to have Islamic names.

During the 18th century, Russian influence rapidly increased toward the region. Led by Empress Catherine, the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs whom the Russians viewed as &quot;savages&quot;, ignorant of morals and ethics.

Russian policy gradually changed toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness. Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite Russian military institutions. In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing pan-Turkism, though many were persecuted as a result. During the Soviet era, Muslim institutions survived only in areas where Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims due to everyday Muslim practices. In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into Communist ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of the Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.

In more recent times, Kazakhs have gradually employed determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the Soviet Union. While not strongly fundamentalist, Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith, and even more devotedly in the countryside. Those who claim descent from the original Muslim warriors and missionaries of the 8th century command substantial respect in their communities. Kazakh political figures have also stressed the need to sponsor Islamic awareness. For example, the Kazakh Foreign Affairs Minister, Marat Tazhin, recently emphasized that Kazakhstan attaches importance to the use of &quot;positive potential Islam, learning of its history, culture and heritage.&quot;

Soviet authorities attempted to encourage a controlled form of Islam under the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan as a unifying force in the Central Asian societies, while at the same time prohibiting true religious freedom. Since independence, religious activity has increased significantly. Construction of mosques and religious schools accelerated in the 1990s, with financial help from Turkey, Egypt, and, primarily, Saudi Arabia. In 1991 170 mosques were operating with more than half of them being newly built. At that time an estimated 230 Muslim communities were active in Kazakhstan. Since then the number of mosques has risen to 2,320 as of 2013. In 2012 the President of Kazakhstan unveiled a new Khazret Sultan Mosque in the capital, that is the biggest Muslim worship facility in Central Asia.

==Islam and the state==

In 1990 Nursultan Nazarbayev, then the First Secretary of the Kazakhstan Communist Party, created a state basis for Islam by removing Kazakhstan from the authority of the Muslim Board of Central Asia, the Soviet-approved and politically oriented religious administration for all of Central Asia. Instead, Nazarbayev created a separate muftiate, or religious authority, for Kazakh Muslims.

With an eye toward the Islamic governments of nearby Iran and Afghanistan, the writers of the 1993 constitution specifically forbade religious political parties. The 1995 constitution forbids organizations that seek to stimulate racial, political, or religious discord, and imposes strict governmental control on foreign religious organizations. As did its predecessor, the 1995 constitution stipulates that Kazakhstan is a secular state; thus, Kazakhstan is the only Central Asian state whose constitution does not assign a special status to Islam. Though, Kazakhstan joined the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in the same year. This position was based on the Nazarbayev government&#x27;s foreign policy as much as on domestic considerations. Aware of the potential for investment from the Muslim countries of the Middle East, Nazarbayev visited Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia; at the same time, he preferred to cast Kazakhstan as a bridge between the Muslim East and the Christian West. For example, he initially accepted only observer status in the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), all of whose member nations are predominantly Muslim. The president&#x27;s first trip to the Muslim holy city of Mecca, which occurred in 1994, was part of an itinerary that also included a visit to Pope John Paul II in the Vatican.

<text>Anuradha Indrajith Cooray (born March 24, 1978) is a Sri Lankan marathon runner. Cooray was a competitor at the 2004 Olympic games, finishing 30th out of 113 in the marathon with a time of 2:19:24.

He won the gold medal in the marathon at the SAF games in Pakistan in 2004. He had previously been a 5000 and 10000 m runner.

Cooray is Sri Lanka&#x27;s national record holder in the men&#x27;s marathon and 10,000 metres and brings back memories of K.A. Karunaratne. Cooray started his running career as a 5000m runner at Divulapitiya Central College. He joined the Sri Lankan army in 1999, coming under the brigadier Perry Liyanage. Cooray reached his peak at the 2004 South Asian Games in Islamabad, April 2004, where he clocked two hours, 16 minutes, 36 seconds to secure the gold medal. Cooray&#x27;s main aim was to compete in the Athens Olympics with a personal best. However he finished eight minutes and 29 seconds behind the gold medalist Stefano Baldini (2:10:55).

Anuradha is currently living in Buckinghamshire, running again and competing for the Vale of Aylesbury Athletic Club. He represented Sri Lanka at the London 2012 Olympics in the marathon in 55th place. He also competed in the Rio 2016 Olympics in the marathon finishing in a time of 2:17:06 in 34th place. At the time of the London Olympics, he worked at Greggs in Aylesbury.

== Career Best Records ==
* Men&#x27;s marathon in 2 hours, 13 minutes, 47 seconds (National Record)
* Men&#x27;s Half-Marathon 1 hour, 4 minutes, 45 seconds (National Record)
* Men&#x27;s 10,000m in 29 minutes, 32 seconds

== London Marathon ==
* 2015 - Cooray produced the performance of his life in this year&#x27;s event to finish 14th in what was not only a new personal best by just over two minutes, but also a new national record with a time of 2 hours 13 minutes 47 seconds, breaking the previous record of 2 hours 14 minutes 31 seconds set by Lucien Rosa in the 1975 Fukuoka Marathon.
* 2013 - Cooray was able to complete the London Marathon 2013 taking the 14th place in 2 hours 17 minutes and 53 seconds. The event was contested by 35,000 participants. Considering his last year&#x27;s performance this is an advancement for him considering the position he finished and an indication of Cooray is still very much in the rhythm.
* 2012 - On the 32nd event of London Marathon, Cooray managed to complete in 23rd place out of 37,500 participants with a timing of 2 hours 17 minutes and 50 seconds.

<text>Paul de Noailles, 6th Duke of Noailles (4 January 1802 – 29 May 1885) was a French nobleman and historian.

He was the grandnephew of the heirless Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, 5th Duke of Noailles, and succeeded him as Duke of Noailles on the latter&#x27;s death in 1824, although he did not take his seat among the peers of France until his majority in 1827. A Knight of the Golden Fleece, he was also noted as a writer and parliamentary orator.

The Duke of Noailles was elected to succeed his friend and confidant Chateaubriand to the Académie Française on 11 January 1849 with twenty five votes out of thirty one. As Honoré de Balzac at that time obtained only four votes, this development occasioned an outburst of protest in the literary press. With the duc Pasquier and the duc de Broglie, the duc de Noailles formed the &quot;parti des ducs&quot; (dukes&#x27; party).

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1856.

==Family==
He was married on 5 February 1823 to Alice de Rochechouart-Mortemart, daughter of Victurnien de Rochechouart, 8th duc de Mortemart,
and had three children:

# Pauline-Victurnienne de Noailles
# Jules-Charles-Victurnien, 7th duc de Noailles
# Emmanuel-Henri-Victurnien, marquis de Noailles

<text>Birdy Nam Nam are a DJ crew from France. Birdy Nam Nam has won several prizes throughout their career including the DMC Technics 2002 World TEAM Championships. Birdy Nam Nam&#x27;s goal is to use the turntable player as an actual musical instrument. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2006 on Uncivilized World Records, and in March that year, they performed at the internationally renowned music conference SXSW. The group&#x27;s name is taken from a line in the 1968 Peter Sellers film &quot;The Party&quot;, directed by Blake Edwards.

==History==
Birdy Nam Nam sources their music from friends and their own albums, pressing beats and patterns into vinyl to assemble their music live.

In 2010, the band won the &quot;Electronic or Dance revelation of the year&quot; at the Victoires de la Musique. In 2012 they gained a wider audience in the Anglophone world thanks to Skrillex. At the &quot;Festival des Artefacts&quot; in Strasbourg, Skrillex played after Birdy Nam Nam and was impressed. He decided to remix their song &quot;Goin&#x27; In&quot; multiple times, and to release a remix album of BNN songs on his label Owsla.

<text>Kenneth Madison Hayne (born 5 June 1945) is a former Justice of the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the Australian court hierarchy.

==Early life and education==

Hayne was born in Gympie, Queensland and attended Scotch College, Melbourne. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) from the University of Melbourne, during which time he resided at Ormond College. Hayne was Editor of the &quot;Melbourne University Law Review&quot;. He then graduated with a Bachelor of Civil Law from Exeter College, Oxford University. He was also a Rhodes Scholar.

He is the husband of another High Court Judge, Michelle Gordon.

==Career==
Kenneth Hayne was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1971 and was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1984.

===Judicial activity===
Kenneth Hayne joined the bench in 1992 when he was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. From 7 June 1995 he sat on the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria, which is the highest court in the Australian State of Victoria.

Hayne was appointed as a Justice of the High Court in September 1997. He retired in 2015 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, in accordance with Section 72 of the Australian Constitution. He was replaced on the High Court by his wife, Federal Court judge Michelle Gordon.

Hayne has been described as being a part of a &#x27;core&#x27; of judges during his time on the High Court, usually forming the majority, and often writing joint reasons with Justice William Gummow. One notable exception was Hayne&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Thomas v Mowbray&quot;, where he joined Justice Michael Kirby in holding the Commonwealth&#x27;s regime of interim control orders applied in respect of suspected terrorists to be unconstitutional. Another, more recent, example is &quot;Kuczborski v Queensland&quot; [2014] HCA 46 in which Hayne J was the sole dissenter.

He serves as a commercial court judge, applying English Common Law, on the ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) Courts.

===Royal Commissioner===
In December 2017 Hayne was appointed to head the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The inquiry received continual media coverage and the report was delivered on 1 February 2019.

===Later public life===
In July 2019 (published in early August), in his first public statement since the Commission, Hayne diagnosed an increasing demand for royal commissions as a symptom that &quot;[t]rust in all sorts of institutions, governmental and private, has been damaged or destroyed&quot;. In his view, the public sees Australia&#x27;s “opaque” decision-making processes as “skewed, if not captured” by powerful vested interests, while leaders are “unable to conduct reasoned debates about policy matters” but instead resort to the “language of war” and seek to “portray opposing views as presenting existential threats to society as we now know it”. He noted, in particular, political reactions to the Uluru Statement from the Heart.

In August 2020, Hayne called upon all sides in politics to end &quot;dialogue of the deaf&quot;, as in hyper-partisan conflict over climate change and over the Indigenous voice to parliament proposed in the Uluru Statement. He hoped that the Covid-19 pandemic would encourage governmental institutions to trust the public more with the truth, so that in response the public might have greater trust in them.

==Notable judgments==
*&quot;Al-Kateb v Godwin&quot; indefinite detention of a stateless person
*&quot;Thomas v Mowbray&quot; concerning the validity of interim control orders
*&quot;Roach v Electoral Commissioner&quot; concerning the validity of Commonwealth legislation preventing prisoners from voting
*&quot;HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen&quot; relevance and admissibility of evidence, as well as directions to jury.
*&quot;Rowe v Electoral Commissioner&quot; concerning the validity of Commonwealth legislation restricting the time in which a voter may seek to enrol in an election
*&quot;South Australia v Totani&quot; issue regarding the separation of powers and in particular, parliament directing the courts
*&quot;Australian Electoral Commission v Johnston&quot; (sitting alone as the Court of Disputed Returns) invalidating the Western Australian Senate election from the 2013 federal election

==Honours==
Hayne received Australia&#x27;s highest civil honour when he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2002 for service to the judiciary, to the law as an outstanding scholar, barrister and jurist, and to the community in the advancement of both legal and general education. Hayne is a patron of the &quot;Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal&quot;.

<doc id="1186356" wikidata="Q7404717" url="?curid=1186356" title="Salinity in Australia">
<text>Soil salinity and dryland salinity are two problems degrading the environment of Australia. Salinity is a concern in most states, but especially in the south-west of Western Australia.

The Eastern Mallee and the Western Mallee of Western Australia are areas that are prone to salinity with little remedial action being undertaken to rectify the problem. Lands surrounding Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde and Dumbleyung Lake have also been affected.

In the Murray River valley irrigation has caused salinity problems. Land surrounding the town of Werrimull in the northwest of Victoria have been affected by salinity due to land clearing.

==Process==
The soil in Australia naturally contains salt, having accumulated over thousands of years. This salt may come from prevailing winds carrying ocean salt, the evaporation of inland seas, and from weathered parent rocks. Rainfall absorbs this salt on the surface, and carries it down into the subsoil where it is stored in unsaturated soil profiles, until it is once again mobilised by ground water and rising water tables. When this ground water comes closer to the surface, this salt is also brought up. As the water eventually evaporates, it leaves behind all this concentrated salt, resulting in soil salinity. 
This can be caused by an imbalance in the hydrological cycle, or by irrigation.

Prior to British settlement in 1788, groundwater levels were in equilibrium. Seasonal recharge, and year-round utilisation of ground water by deep rooted native vegetation resulted in ground water levels remaining static.
Land clearing in Australia has resulted in a loss of this native vegetation, replaced largely by agriculture and pasture crops. These are often shallow rooted annual plants which are unable to intercept and adequately absorb stored and rising ground water. This creates an imbalance in the hydrological cycle, and results in dryland salinity.
Salinity is classified as a dissolved salt content of a substance like soil or water. Salinity can prevent crops and other vegetation from growing leaving land empty.

Irrigation is also a contributor to salinity. Firstly, the addition of irrigation acts to simulate rainfall, and if not applied at appropriate levels, can result in the recharge of water tables, and promotes rises in the water table. 
Secondly, irrigation water itself can contain salts, which are deposited into the soil with its use. This level of salt can range from 0.5 - 2 tonne per hectare per year, and can greatly increase natural salt levels.

==Effects and impacts==
Over time this process has caused the thin top-soil layers to become irreversibly salty and no longer suited for agriculture. By 1999 an estimated 2.5 million hectares of land had become salinised since the introduction of European farming methods.

Currently, around 5.7 million hectares of land is classed as having &#x27;high potential&#x27; for salinisation with that number expected to rise to 17 million hectares by 2050.

High soil salt levels have dramatic impact on plant root zones, in both native vegetation as well as agricultural and pasture crops, natural wetlands and surrounding water ways. An increase in salt can decrease the ability of plants to absorb water through their roots by osmosis, cause leaf burn and necrosis through increased levels of sodium and chloride, and create nutrient and ionic imbalances resulting in poor growth and death. Salinity can also adversely affect infrastructure such as roads, buildings, underground pipes and cables through oxidation.

&quot;Muehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita&quot;, commonly known as the Remote Thorny Lignum, is a critically endangered species due to its intolerance to salinity.

===Impacts by state===
====New South Wales====
Currently 5% of New South Wales is affected by dry land salinity, and around 50% is under threat.
15% of current irrigated land is impacted, and up to 30% is currently under threat. 
The main regions currently affected, and at high risk, are The Murrumbidgee River catchment near Griffith, and Jemalong River Catchment near Forbes, as well as the Murray River irrigation area near Deniliquin.

====Victoria====
The current levels of salinity in Victoria are relatively small, with the main impact expected to occur in high risk areas in the coming years.
These high risk areas include the Campaspe, Loddon, Corangamite, Glenelg-Hopkins, Goulburn-Broken catchments, and Wimmera and Mallee regions.
The current cost to Victoria is estimated at $50million per year. This is expected to rise significantly with the impacts on agricultural land, wetlands and infrastructure in high risk areas to increase, mainly in part to an anticipated 10 fold increase in salt levels by 2050.

====Western Australia====
Western Australia contains the majority of land affected by salinity in Australia, with around 70%. 
Over 2 million hectares are currently affected, and around 4 million hectares of land are currently listed as high risk, and 50% of divertible water is already considered overly saline.
Around 450 plant species are endemic to areas that are at high risk of salinisation
75% of water bird species in decline, a 75% reduction in sealed road life, and $400million in lost profits.

====South Australia====
Salinity in South Australia is a problem in all principal agricultural areas, with 370000 hectares of land and wetlands impacted. At current rates, this is expected to increase by 60% by 2050.
It is expected to cost the state around $47million per year in lost agricultural profit, and is expected to taint more than 20% of ground water to levels above those safe for human consumption.

====Tasmania====
Tasmania is relatively unaffected by salinity, with around 1% of agricultural land, and 8% of farm land adversely affected by salt, resulting in a current cost to the state of around $5million per year, rising to around $13million by 2050. The majority of this salinity is irrigation based.

====Queensland====
Queensland is the least affected state of Australia, due to its unique seasonal rainfall. Around 15000 hectares are currently affected, with 3.1million hectares considered highrisk.
At current rates however, salinity is predicted to have moderate scale impacts on land and infrastructure by 2050, with 12,000 km of roads, 1500 km of rail lines, and around 2.8million hectares of agricultural land, remnant vegetation, and wetlands and streams negatively affected

==Impact reduction and management==
===Government initiatives===
The Australian governments have taken an integrated approach to target different scales of management. The approach is to manage the salinity issue at national, regional and state levels, down to local and individual farmers. Since 1983 the Australian governments have actioned the National Soil Conservation Program, National Landcare Program, Natural Heritage Trust, National Action Plan for Salinity and Water and Caring for our Country.

The National Landcare Program focused on improving resource management and practices at the farm and local level. The National Dryland Salinity Program (1993 to 2004), funded a broad range of research and development from which to roll out further government programs.

The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAPSWQ), implemented together with the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) program, ran from 2000 to 2008. The NAPSWQ was adopted through an intergovernmental agreement between Australian commonwealth, state and territory governments. The plan aimed to help support community action and land managers in adversely affected catchments, and was rolled out by regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) organisations. The governments committed $1.4 billion over seven years to tackle the salinity problem. The plan involved input and participation from government, community, local business and land managers. The NAPSWQ focused on 21 regions across Australia that were deemed; through hazard assessments and dryland salinity risk, to be most affected by salinity and water problems. The goal of the NAPSWQ was to motivate and enable regional communities in preventing, stabilising and reversing trends in salinity; improve water quality and secure reliable allocations for both human, industrial and environment use. The overarching objectives of the NHT were biodiversity conservation, sustainable use of natural resources, community capacity building and institutional change.
The final report for the NAPSWQ states that ‘With few exceptions the massive efforts involved in delivering NAPSWQ and NHT programs have at best halted the degradation of these resources. This has reinforced the view of the State of Environment (SoE) Report that concluded that the condition of these resources continues to decline despite the best efforts of the community and government&#x27;.

In 2008 the initiative Caring for our Country was started to replace the National Action Plan, which had ceased. This Australian Government initiative aims to build on the work done under the NAPSWQ, focusing on a more targeted asset-based approach, and aims to build attitudes of environmental stewardship.

==== Case study examples ====
Salinity management in the Murray-Darling Basin has included investment in salt interception schemes, rehabilitation of irrigation areas, and programs to educate landholders and irrigators on better practices

In the South-west rivers region of Western Australia, salinity impacts on potable and irrigation water supplies, and the areas unique biodiversity. Outcomes of NRM programs in Western Australia include re-vegetation, fencing, soil treatment, drainage works, treatment for soil erosion, monitoring programs, support of community projects, training, conservation agreements and a Strategic Tree Farming project.

Tasmania faces different salinity management issues due to its unique topography. Under the Caring for our Country Project Tasmania has set up demonstration farm sites which test management strategies of surface and sub-surface drainage, and trees planting to intercept water, and salt tolerant plant species.

===Best management practice===
There is no clear agreement about what constitutes best management practice for salinity in Australia. While there are a range of techniques and strategies available, success is often varied from one context to the next; there is no simple solution. Location, time frame and personal circumstances may all influence the effectiveness of particular options.

Possible management strategies include: 
*The use of salt-tolerant plants, such as:
**&quot;Atriplex amnicola&quot;
**Saltgrow - a hybrid gum tree being utilized within Australia to try to reverse damage within affected high-salinity areas. The tree has been highly successful, and has been attributed to be able to completely remove salinity within damaged areas and allowed new grasses and shrubs that are not salt resistant, to grow.
*The use of perennial crops and pastures
*Engineering responses including deep drainage and pumping (to lower groundwater)
*Reverse banks and interceptor banks (to divert surface water)
*Revegetation with native species
*Establishing trees
*Preventing further clearing in vulnerable areas

A number of organisations are seeking ways to reduce the impact of salinity on Australian agriculture, including the Cooperative Research Centre for Plant-Based Management of Dryland Salinity. Greening Australia and Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics have also implemented projects to alleviate salinity in Australia.

===Community-based management strategies===
Community-based approaches have been a key feature of many regional salinity management programs in Australia. This is in response to various government initiatives, notably the National Landcare Program (1989), Natural Heritage Trust (1997) and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (2000).
This approach provides the social platform required in many cases for the successful adoption of salinity management practices. Often lacking however, is the presence of scientific skills and detailed knowledge needed to develop viable technical and economic salinity management options. It is also suggested that community-based approaches may reinforce existing power structures, disadvantaging those who are already marginalised when making decisions about salinity management.

Below are some examples of community-based programs currently operating in Australia and their contributions to salinity management.

====Landcare====
Landcare groups involve community members and landowners working together in a voluntary capacity to improve land management practices. In relation to the management of salinity, these groups have been effective in: raising awareness and educating the community about dryland salinity; allowing local knowledge and information to be shared in order to develop suitable management plans; developing skills, building capacity and empowering communities to address salinity issues.

====Saltwatch====
Established in Victoria in 1987, Saltwatch is an ongoing community- and school-based program focused on monitoring salinity levels in Australian waterways. Students, teachers and community members are involved in collecting water samples from their local area, conducting salinity tests and recording this data. It is an effective educational tool that provides opportunities for partnerships to be developed between government agencies and the wider community, however it is not necessarily linked directly to the implementation of salinity management strategies.

==Climate change and its impact on salinity==
There are mixed predictions in relation to climate change&#x27;s effect on salinity in Australia. Climate change could potentially ameliorate salinity in Australia in some circumstances, but in others it may have detrimental effects. It is predicted that in some instances climate change will result in the reduction in annual rainfall leading to a drier and warmer climate, which will ultimately reduce salinity. Conversely climate changes impact on the salt concentration in water bodies is expected to be unfavourable.

Where there is a reduction in rainfall it is expected that salinity will be reduced. This will occur as a result of the water table being recharged less often, reducing the chance of the water table transporting underground salts to the surface of the land. Climate change may also result in the offsetting of rainfall into different seasons, resulting in larger down pours and extreme weather events in some locations within Australia. In these instances as evaporation will not occur at a faster pace than rainfall, it is likely to result in excessive additions to aquifers, which is also known as deep drainage. This is an issue as dryland salinity is onset by additional deep drainage. In Australia this will be most evident in South Australia, Victoria and the lower half of Western Australia. However these changes are expected to be minimal as the water table may already be reduced from excessive periods of drought.

On the other hand, the reduction of water in streams, rivers, water bodies and the like is likely to result in an increase of salt concentration in these water bodies. This will be particularly evident in groundwater flow systems of different catchments. Austin &quot;et al.&quot; of CSIRO have predicted that water in the Murrumbidgee will drop by up to approximately 48% by 2070 which will result in salt yields on the surface of the land falling by approximately 30%, however the stream salinity concentrations are predicted to increase by 11%.

<text>Arthur Guiterman (; November 20, 1871 Vienna – January 11, 1943 New York) was an American writer best known for his humorous poems.

==Life and career==
Guiterman was born of American parents in Vienna. His father was Alexander Gütermann, born in the Bavarian village Redwitz an der Rodach, and his mother was Louisa Wolf, born in Cincinnati. Arthur graduated from the City College of New York in 1891, and later was married in 1909 to Vida Lindo. He was an editor of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; and the &quot;Literary Digest&quot;. In 1910, he cofounded the Poetry Society of America, and later served as its president in 1925–26.

An example of his humour is a poem that talks about modern progress, with rhyming couplets such as &quot;First dentistry was painless;/Then bicycles were chainless&quot;. It ends on a more telling note:
Another Guiterman poem, &quot;On the Vanity of Earthly Greatness&quot;, illustrates the philosophy also incorporated into his humorous rhymes:
Perhaps his most-quoted poem is his 1936 &quot;D.A.R.ling&quot; satire about the Daughters of the American Revolution (and three other clubs open only to descendants of pre-Independence British Americans). That poem has an intricate, strongly dramatic rhythmical structure.

He also notably wrote the libretto for Walter Damrosch&#x27;s &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; which premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on May 12, 1937.

<doc id="1186363" wikidata="Q161571" url="?curid=1186363" title="Javier Mascherano">
<text>Javier Alejandro Mascherano (; born 8 June 1984) is an Argentine football manager and former player who is the current head coach of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami. As a player, he played as a centre-back or defensive midfielder, most notably for Liverpool, Barcelona and the Argentina national team, being heralded as one of the best defenders and midfielders of his generation.

Mascherano began his career at River Plate, where he earned his first senior honours, the Argentine Primera División, in the 2003–04 season. He moved to Brazilian side Corinthians in 2005, winning the Brazilian Série A that same year, and then joined West Ham United in the Premier League; however, his brief time with the Hammers was blighted by unusual contract terms with Global Soccer Agencies. At the beginning of 2007, Mascherano was loaned out to Liverpool and reached the UEFA Champions League final. Afterwards, his deal was made permanent for £18.7 million. He left for Barcelona in 2010, winning five La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues and two FIFA Club World Cups among other honours, in eight years before having stints in China and his native Argentina.

Mascherano made 147 appearances for the Argentina national team and is the second most capped player in the country&#x27;s history (after Lionel Messi). From his debut in 2003 until his retirement in 2018, he represented the nation at five Copa América tournaments, finishing runner-up in 2004, 2007, 2015, and 2016, and four FIFA World Cups, reaching the 2014 final. He twice won a gold medal at the Summer Olympics, in 2004 and 2008, becoming the first male footballer to achieve this double feat since Hungarian defender Dezső Novák in 1968. Between 2008 and 2011, Mascherano served as the captain of Argentina.

==Club career==
===River Plate===
Born in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe, Mascherano came through the youth ranks at River Plate in Buenos Aires, Argentina. However, before making his club debut he made his name representing Argentina.

Mascherano won his first silverware when River won the 2003–04 Clausura championship. In the 2004 Copa Libertadores River reached the semi-final, but lost on penalties to arch-rivals Boca Juniors. Around this time several clubs including Real Madrid, and Deportivo La Coruña declared an interest in signing Mascherano, but River Plate turned down all offers, saying that none of the interested parties were prepared to pay enough.

2004–05 was not a successful season for River, finishing third in the Apertura Championship and only tenth in the Clausura. In the Copa Libertadores River again lost in the semi-final, this time to São Paulo. After the Confederations Cup in Germany, Brazilian club Corinthians acquired Mascherano from River Plate for US$15 million.

===Corinthians===
The Brazilian Série A runs from April, so Mascherano joined Corinthians mid-season. After playing only nine games for his new club, in September 2005, Mascherano fractured his left foot, causing him to miss the end of the season. He returned to Argentina to be operated on by the national team doctor and recuperate. Corinthians, however, still won the Série A title with Mascherano&#x27;s compatriot, Carlos Tevez, as captain.

In total, Mascherano was out of action for six months, only returning on 5 March 2006. Corinthians were forced to start their 2006 Copa Libertadores without Mascherano, but he returned in time for the Round of 16 tie against River Plate, which the &quot;Timão&quot; lost. The 2006 Brazilian Série A also went badly for Corinthians – at one point, they were even battling relegation. In June, the league was interrupted for the 2006 World Cup.

Although his performances in both Brazil and Germany drew the attention of European clubs, Mascherano stated his desire to remain with Corinthians to help with their relegation battle and postponed any transfer until January at the earliest. Hours before the summer transfer window of 2006 closed in Europe, however, he joined West Ham United alongside Tevez for an undisclosed fee.

===West Ham===
Throughout the summer of 2006, Mascherano was linked with top clubs around Europe; he stated he would relish playing in Spain for Real Madrid or Barcelona. Serie A side Juventus was also interested in him, but he came with Carlos Tevez to West Ham instead. There were many rumours about the surprise nature of Mascherano and Tevez&#x27;s transfers, primarily regarding Media Sports Investment&#x27;s interest in buying out the club and whether they truly owned the two players, or whether a third party held their registration, and also that if a high enough (£112 million was touted) offer was received, West Ham would be forced to sell. (It has since been discovered that Mystere Services and Global Soccer Agencies are the companies that owned Mascherano.)

Before Mascherano joined, West Ham had won, drew and lost one game each. Upon his arrival, however, the Hammers went into free-fall, losing eight times and drawing once in all competitions before their next win on 29 October. During this time, Mascherano rarely featured in the squad despite their struggles, prompting rumours about financial clauses related to the amount of time he actually played. In October, national team coach Alfio Basile stated that he hoped Mascherano would leave West Ham &quot;as soon as possible&quot; and join Juventus.

On 16 January 2007, Liverpool requested clearance from FIFA to take Mascherano on loan from West Ham. FIFA&#x27;s rules state that no player can play for more than two clubs between 1 July and 30 June the following year, as Mascherano had already played for both Corinthians and West Ham during that time.

FIFA approved the deal on 31 January 2007. However, although Liverpool submitted his registration details before the midnight transfer deadline, the Premier League did not immediately announce whether it would allow Mascherano to play for Liverpool, saying that it wanted to &quot;take time to satisfy itself with the proposed arrangements&quot;.

In a further development, it was announced on 2 March that the Premier League were charging West Ham with breaking rule B13, concerning acting in good faith, and rule U18, which concerns the influence of third-party ownership. On 27 April, the Premier League issued West Ham a world-record fine of £5.5 million.

===Liverpool===

On 10 February 2007, Liverpool added Mascherano to their UEFA Champions League squad and gave him the number 20 shirt. Eventually, on 20 February 2007, Mascherano&#x27;s move to Liverpool became official after the Premier League accepted Liverpool&#x27;s request to register the player at Anfield.

Mascherano made his debut for Liverpool against Sheffield United on 24 February 2007, and was praised by the Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez and team captain Steven Gerrard after Liverpool&#x27;s 4–0 victory. After playing in a match against Arsenal on 31 March, Benítez called Mascherano a &quot;monster of a player&quot;. Similarly, his teammates were impressed by his talent; Xabi Alonso noted how mature a player he was for his age, saying, &quot;He has a cool mind on the pitch. He is analysing and thinking about the game in each moment.&quot; Mascherano&#x27;s first Champions League appearance came in the quarter-final first leg away to PSV Eindhoven on 3 April. Hastily establishing himself as a starter at the club, Mascherano played in the Champions League Final that year against Milan. He and teammate Alonso were successful in stifling the creative play of both Kaká and Clarence Seedorf for much of the match but Liverpool eventually succumbed to Milan, losing 2–1 at the Olympic Stadium in Athens. He was voted Liverpool&#x27;s man of the match by the fans on the official Liverpool website.
Following months of speculation, Mascherano signed a four-year permanent contract with Liverpool on 29 February 2008, ending his association with Media Sports Investments. The transfer reportedly cost Liverpool £18.6 million, and covered not only the transfer fee, but also the player&#x27;s wages for the four-year deal. It was allowed to go through immediately as Mascherano was not contracted to another club, making him exempt from the rules of the transfer window. He scored his first Premier League and Liverpool goal on 15 March 2008, with a 20-yard strike against Reading.

On 29 November 2009, Mascherano claimed the first goal in the 2–0 win against Everton at Goodison Park when his 30-yard shot appeared to be heading just off target before it took a wicked deflection off Joseph Yobo before finding the net. The goal officially went down as an own goal. In a match against Portsmouth on 19 December 2009, Mascherano was sent off for committing a bad foul on Tal Ben Haim. It was later confirmed that the sending off meant a four-match suspension for Mascherano. This was due to this being his second red card of the season, Liverpool went on to lose the match 2–0. Mascherano had the worst disciplinary record of the 2009–10 Premier League season with seven yellow cards and two red. He scored his first goal of the season with a bullet of a shot from outside the area in the UEFA Europa League against Unirea Urziceni away from home in a match Liverpool won 3–1 to secure their place in the round of 16 of the competition with an aggregate win of 4–1.

On 27 July 2010, after returning from a break after the 2010 World Cup, Mascherano informed new Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson that he wanted to leave the club. During that break, Hodgson had failed with several attempts to contact Mascherano, able only to leave messages for him saying that he was looking forward to meeting him back on Merseyside as his calls went unreturned.

Mascherano was held in high esteem by the Liverpool fans, who gave him his own song, (to the tune of the White Stripes&#x27; &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;). After winning the 2011 Champions League Final with Barcelona against Manchester United, Mascherano, speaking directly after the match, said, &quot;I want to say, I know that Liverpool supporters, after my exit, I know they were a little bit sad with me—this is for them as well.&quot;

Liverpool announced on 27 August that they had agreed a £17.25 million transfer fee with Barcelona for the player and had given permission for him to speak with the Spanish club.

====2008 Old Trafford incident====
In his first game at Old Trafford against Manchester United on 23 March 2008, Mascherano was sent off after collecting two yellow cards. He was initially booked for a late tackle on Paul Scholes, and later dismissed for running towards referee Steve Bennett to protest a yellow card shown to Fernando Torres. Mascherano had to be pushed from the field of play by Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso. Rafael Benítez was forced to leave the dugout and plead with Mascherano to leave the field, and he was escorted down the tunnel by Peter Crouch. The Football Association ruled that the usual one-game suspension be increased to three games for improper conduct. Mascherano admitted the improper conduct charge levelled at him, but appealed the further two-to-three-match suspension. This appeal was denied by the FA, however, and Mascherano was also fined £15,000; he demanded that this fine would be paid to a charity.

With the controversial incident behind him, Mascherano would play a role in Liverpool&#x27;s 2–1 win over Manchester United at Anfield on 13 September 2008, although he was at fault for failing to cover countryman Carlos Tevez, who scored for United less than three minutes into the game. Mascherano made amends for his mistake, and was instrumental in creating the goal which put Liverpool 2–1 up. Mascherano was voted Man of the Match by the fans on Liverpool&#x27;s official website.

===Barcelona===

On 28 August 2010, Mascherano agreed terms on a four-year contract with Barcelona for €24 million. On 30 August 2010, Mascherano passed his medical to complete his transfer and told Barça TV, &quot;The truth is it&#x27;s a dream, it&#x27;s a great joy.&quot; He made his league debut on 11 September 2010, starting in a 0–2 home defeat against recently promoted Hércules, marking the first defeat at the Camp Nou in 16 months. Mascherano had a mixed season at the Camp Nou, spending the first half of the season mainly coming off the bench but for the latter part playing out of position in a centre-back role. On 28 May 2011, Mascherano started alongside Gerard Piqué in the 2011 Champions League final against Manchester United at the Wembley Stadium. Barcelona went on to win the game 3–1, with Mascherano dedicating the win to Liverpool fans, some of which he had upset during his move. In the run to the final, Mascherano denied Arsenal&#x27;s Nicklas Bendtner a certain goal with a sliding tackle towards the end of the second leg of the round of 16 match, with the Catalan giants beating the Gunners 3–1, 4–3 on aggregate.

In his second season, Mascherano played almost exclusively as a centre-back, putting in consistent performances starting regularly for Barcelona in defence.

On 26 July 2012, Mascherano signed a contract extension, keeping him with the &quot;Blaugrana&quot; until 2016. His buyout clause was set at €100 million. On 7 June 2014, Mascherano signed an extension on his contract, tying him to the Catalan club until 2018 and keeping his buyout clause at €100 million.

On 6 June 2015, Mascherano started in the 2015 Champions League final, as the club won its fifth Champions League title by defeating Juventus 3–1 at Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion. This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup/Champions League twice.

Upon club captain Xavi&#x27;s departure in 2015, Mascherano was named the 4th captain of Barcelona for the 2015-16 season behind Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets. On 27 July 2016, Mascherano signed a new contract with Barcelona, which would keep him at the club until 2019.

On 26 April 2017, Mascherano scored his first and only goal for Barcelona, a penalty kick in a La Liga match against Osasuna.

On 23 January 2018, Barcelona announced that Mascherano would leave the club after seven and a half seasons.

===Hebei China Fortune===
On 24 January 2018, Chinese Super League side Hebei China Fortune announced the signing of Mascherano for €5.5 million, which would be effective 2 days later. He scored his first goal for the club in a Chinese FA Cup match against Shandong Luneng Taishan on 2 May 2018.

===Return to Argentina and retirement===
On 23 November 2019, it was announced that Mascherano would be joining Argentine club Estudiantes in January 2020 on a free transfer. He made his official debut in a league match against San Lorenzo on 25 January 2020, which ended in a 1–1 draw.

On 15 November 2020, Mascherano announced his retirement as a professional footballer.

==International career==
Mascherano&#x27;s first international appearance came in 2001. September of that year saw him play on the Argentina team that finished fourth in the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship. In June 2003, he played at the Toulon Tournament, becoming the competition&#x27;s best player as Argentina&#x27;s under-20s finished 3rd.

Mascherano&#x27;s impact at youth levels was such that he made his senior international debut before playing a single minute for River Plate&#x27;s first team (due to his central midfield position at club level being occupied by River&#x27;s long standing captain Leonardo Astrada, nicknamed &quot;the Chief&quot;). That international debut came in a friendly against Uruguay on 16 July 2003.

Halfway through the 2003–04 Apertura championship, Mascherano was called up to play in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Argentina again finished fourth with Mascherano the team&#x27;s outstanding player. He was however suspended for the third place play-off.

In January 2004, Mascherano joined up with Argentina U23 for the South American Pre-Olímpico tournament in Chile. Argentina won the tournament, thereby qualifying for the 2004 Summer Olympics. In August, Mascherano and the team went on to become gold medal-winners in Greece.

At the end of the 2003–04 season, Mascherano was included in the Argentina senior squad for the 2004 Copa América. Argentina lost to Brazil on penalties in the final, but Mascherano impressed enough to be voted Argentina&#x27;s player of the tournament by his teammates.

In the 2006 World Cup, Mascherano played every minute of every match for Argentina, with the team being eliminated by Germany in the quarter-finals.

His first two goals for the senior Argentina team came in July 2007 during the 2007 Copa América. On 5 July, he scored the only goal in Argentina&#x27;s final group stage match against Paraguay, which saw them finish in first place in their group with nine points. On 8 July, he scored a goal in a 4–0 victory over Peru in the quarter-finals. Argentina went on to reach the final of the tournament, where they suffered a 3–0 defeat to Brazil on 15 July. Mascherano&#x27;s outstanding performance at the tournament saw him widely selected as the best Argentine player in a squad full of stars.

On 8 June 2008, Mascherano received his first red card for the national team after receiving two yellow cards in a match against the United States. He was sent off in the 86th minute of the match, which finished 0–0.

Later that year, Mascherano was selected to represent Argentina under-23 squad at 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing as an overage player. He was thrilled at the call-up, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s important for any athlete to defend the gold medal. I might be the only person from my country ever to do it and I&#x27;ll go down in history.&quot; Argentina won the tournament, making Mascherano the first Argentine sportsman ever to win two Olympic gold medals.

Soon after being appointed head coach of Argentina in November 2008, Diego Maradona announced that he wanted Mascherano to be the team&#x27;s captain. &quot;I want Mascherano to be my captain because I believe he is the Argentinian player who is closest to the idea I have about the Argentinian shirt – sweat for it, sacrifice for it, being a professional, being close to the team-mate,&quot; Maradona said. &quot;I will convince him. He will be my captain.&quot;

Mascherano was appointed the new Argentina captain on 10 November, replacing Javier Zanetti. At the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was captained by Messi, who became Argentina&#x27;s youngest World Cup captain and reached the quarter-finals where they were again eliminated by Germany, 4–0. He only missed the last match of the group stage against Greece.
Mascherano captained Argentina during the 2011 Copa América on home soil, but the team were defeated by Uruguay at the quarter-final stage. In August 2011, Mascherano was replaced as Argentina captain by Lionel Messi, who was appointed to the role by new manager Alejandro Sabella. Mascherano became vice-captain in the national squad.
In the 2014 World Cup, Mascherano played his 100th international match for Argentina in a match against Iran, which &quot;la Albiceleste&quot; won 1–0. During the tournament, Messi wore the captain&#x27;s armband and commentators often described the team as Messi plus ten other players, however Mascherano was the squad&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader and midfield general. Mascherano asserted himself vocally, especially during the knockout rounds, where the media described him as Argentina&#x27;s best player after Messi&#x27;s prolific scoring stagnated after the group stage. During Argentina&#x27;s World Cup semi-final against the Netherlands, Mascherano was knocked unconscious by a header contested by Georginio Wijnaldum and was led off the pitch with a suspected concussion, although he resumed play moments later. In stoppage time, Mascherano tore his anus making a goal-saving slide tackle on Arjen Robben. Argentina would go on to advance to the final in a penalty shootout, with goalkeeper Sergio Romero saving kicks from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder. Thanks to Mascherano&#x27;s prowess as a defensive midfielder and leader, Argentina entered the final having not conceded a goal in 330 minutes during elimination games, as well as never having trailed in the tournament.

On 11 July, Mascherano was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA&#x27;s Golden Ball award for the tournament&#x27;s best player. He recorded the most tackles of any player at the tournament (30) and the third-most passes (576 at a success rate of 89%), playing in every minute of Argentina&#x27;s campaign. In the Final, Argentina lost 1–0 to Germany after extra time, with Mario Götze scoring in the 113th minute.
In May 2018, Mascherano was named in Jorge Sampaoli&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He earned his 143rd cap in a 4–0 friendly win against Haiti on 29 May 2018, equaling Javier Zanetti&#x27;s record for the most appearances for Argentina. His 144th cap came in Argentina&#x27;s opening match at the World Cup, a 1–1 draw against Iceland on 16 June 2018, thus becoming the sole most capped player in the country&#x27;s history.
On 30 June 2018, following Argentina&#x27;s elimination from the World Cup after a 4–3 loss against France in the Round of 16, Mascherano announced his retirement from international football, having obtained 147 caps and scored 3 goals for his country.

==Coaching career==
In December 2021, Mascherano was named manager of the Argentina under-20 team, taking over the side in early January. He led the national team at the 2024 Summer Olympics, where Argentina was eliminated in the quarterfinals.

On 26 November 2024, Major League Soccer side Inter Miami appointed Mascherano as their new head coach.

==Playing style==
Nicknamed &quot;El Jefecito&quot; (&quot;The Little Chief&quot;), Mascherano was a versatile, hard-working, and tactically intelligent footballer, with an excellent ability to read the game and organise his team; he was known in particular for his leadership skills, passing accuracy, energy, positional sense, tough marking of opponents, and hard-tackling style of play, despite his relatively small physical stature. Considered as one of the best defenders and defensive midfielders of his generation, although he has primarily served as either a holding midfielder or central defender throughout his career, he has also been deployed as a right-back or even as a box-to-box or central midfielder on occasion. Regarding Mascherano&#x27;s playing style, Jonathan Wilson noted in a 2013 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the Argentine was an example of a type of holding midfielder that he dubbed a &quot;destroyer&quot;, who &quot;clattered about making tackles and collecting bookings, his role almost entirely of regaining possession and distributing it simply.&quot;

==Personal life==
In October 2015, Mascherano admitted two counts of fraud totalling just over €1.5 million having failed to declare €1.5 million in earnings in 2011 and 2012. In January 2016, he appeared in court in an attempt to avoid imprisonment for the offences, and was fined €800,000. He was sentenced to one year in prison for evasion of tax payments. The sentence was suspended and resulted in no jail time served, provided he does not offend again during the suspended sentence.

<doc id="1186383" wikidata="Q2637700" url="?curid=1186383" title="Islam in Nigeria">
<text>Islam is one of the two largest religions in Nigeria. Nigeria also has the largest Muslim population in Africa. In 2018, the CIA World Factbook estimated that 53.5% of Nigeria&#x27;s population is Muslim. Islam is predominantly concentrated in the northern half of the country, with a significant Muslim minority existing in the southern region. Most of Northern Nigeria is governed under Sharia law, while the rest of the country is governed under secular law. The Muslim share of Nigeria&#x27;s population is growing, due to a higher fertility rate.

Merchants from North Africa and the Senegalese basin introduced Islam to what is now Nigeria during the 11th century, and it was the first monotheistic Abrahamic religion to arrive in Nigeria. The northern half of Nigeria was historically under the rule of various Islamic states and empires such as the Kanem–Bornu Empire, the Mali Empire, the Songhai Empire, and the Hausa Kingdoms. The Sokoto Caliphate, founded by Fulani Islamic scholar Usman dan Fodio, dominated northern Nigeria throughout the 19th century during the Fula jihads, until it was annexed by the British Empire in 1903. Portuguese missionaries introduced Christianity to the southern half of Nigeria during the 15th century, and it grew to be a dominant religion in Nigeria alongside Islam during British colonial rule beginning in the late 19th century.

Muslims in Nigeria are predominantly Sunnis of the Maliki school of thought. However, there is a significant Shia minority, primarily in Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Osun, Kwara, Yobe and Sokoto states (see Shia in Nigeria). In particular, A 2008 Pew Forum survey on religious diversity identified 5% of Nigerian Muslims as Shia. The Ahmadiyya movement also has a sizeable presence in the country.

==History==
===Islam in Northern Nigeria===

Islam was introduced to Nigeria during the 11th century through two geographical routes: North Africa and the Senegalese Basin. The origins of Islam in the country is linked with the development of Islam in the wider West Africa. Trade was the major connecting link that brought Islam into Nigeria. Islam was first documented in Central Sudan by medieval Islamic historians and geographers such as Al-Bakri, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Al-Maqrizi and later works of Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldun offered more notes about Islam in West Africa.

Islam grew in North-East Nigeria, in particular, the Kanem empire as a result of trade between Kanem and Northern African regions of Fezzan, Egypt and Cyrenaica in the eleventh century. Muslim merchants from the North sometimes remained in settlements along trade routes, this merchant class would later preach the message of Islam to their host communities. The first documented conversion of a traditional ruler was in the eleventh century when Mai Ume Jilmi of Kanem was converted by a Muslim scholar whose descendants later held a hereditary title of Chief Imam of Kanem.

Writings by Ahmad Fartua an Imam during the period of Idris Alooma provided glimpse of an active Islamic community in Bornu while religious archives showed Islam had been adopted as the religion of the majority of the leading figures in the Borno Empire during the reign of Mai (king) Idris Alooma (1571–1603), although a large part of that country still adhered to traditional religions. Alooma furthered the cause of Islam in the country by introducing Islamic courts, establishing mosques, and setting up a hostel in Makkah, the Islamic pilgrimage destination, for Kanuris.

In Hausaland, particularly Kano, Islam is noted to have penetrated the territory in the fourteenth century from West African traders who were the Mande people Muslims from the Senegalese basin and Muslim traders from Mali Empire. Muhammed Rumfa (1463 - 1499) was the first ruler to convert to Islam in Hausaland. It had spread to the major cities of the northern part of the country by the 16th century, later moving into the countryside and towards the Middle Belt uplands. However, there are some claims for an earlier arrival. The Nigeria-born Muslim scholar Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Abdul-Fattah Adelabu has argued that Islam had reached Sub-Sahara Africa, including Nigeria, as early as the 1st century of Hijrah through Muslim traders and expeditions during the reign of the Arab conqueror, Uqba ibn al Nafia (622–683), whose Islamic conquests under the Umayyad dynasty, during Muawiyah&#x27;s and Yazid&#x27;s time, spread all Northern Africa or the Maghrib Al-Arabi, which includes present-day Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.
====Fulani War====

In the early 19th century, Islamic scholar Usman dan Fodio launched a jihad, which is called the Fulani War, against the Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria. He was victorious, and established the Fulani Empire with its capital at Sokoto.

====Sokoto Caliphate====
In 1803, Usman dan Fodio founded the Sokoto Caliphate. Usman dan Fodio was elected &quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot; () by his followers. The Sokoto Caliphate became one of the largest empires in Africa, stretching from modern-day Burkina Faso to Cameroon and including most of northern Nigeria and southern Niger. At its height, the Sokoto state included over 30 different emirates under its political structure. In its hold, the caliphate ruled through much of the 19th century, until 29 July 1903, the second battle of Burmi concluded its dissolution by British and German forces.

=== Islam in Southwestern Nigeria ===
Islam also came to the southwestern Yoruba-speaking areas during the time of the Mali Empire. In his Movements of Islam in face of the Empires and Kingdoms in Yorubaland, Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu supported his claims on early arrival of Islam in the southwestern Nigeria by citing the Arab anthropologist Abduhu Badawi, who argued that the fall of Koush southern Egypt and the prosperity of the politically multicultural Abbasid period in the continent had created several streams of migration, moving west in the mid-9th Sub-Sahara. According to Adelabu, the popularity and influences of the Abbasid dynasty, the second great dynasty with the rulers carrying the title of &#x27;Caliph&#x27; fostered peaceful and prosperous search of pastures by the inter-cultured Muslims from Nile to Niger and Arab traders from Desert to Benue, echoing the conventional historical view that the conquest of North Africa by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate between AD 647–709 effectively ended Catholicism in Africa for several centuries. Islam in Ancient Yoruba is referred to as &quot;Esin Imale&quot;, which folk etymology states it comes from the word &quot;Mali.&quot; The earliest introduction of the religion to that region was through Malian itinerant traders (Wangara Traders) around the 14th century. Large-scale conversion to Islam happened in the 18th-19th centuries.

Yorubas came in contact with Islam around the 14th century during the reign of Mansa Kankan Musa of the Mali Empire. According to Al-Aluri, the first mosque was built in Ọyọ-Ile in AD 1550 although, there were no Yoruba Muslims, the mosque only served the spiritual needs of foreign Muslims living in Ọyọ. Progressively, Islam came to Yoruba land, and Muslims started building Mosques: Iwo town led, its first Mosque built in 1655 followed by Iṣẹyin, in 1760; Lagos, 1774; Ṣaki, 1790; and Oṣogbo, 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like Oyo (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), Ibadan, Abẹokuta, Ijẹbu-Ode, Ikirun, and Ẹdẹ before the 19th-century Sokoto jihad. Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yoruba land by mid 19th century. Before the decline of Ọyọ, several towns around it had large Muslim communities; when Ọyọ was destroyed these Muslims (Yoruba and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam protagonists. Second, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yoruba land, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their host. According to Eades, the religion &quot;differed in attraction&quot; and &quot;better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy&quot;; more influential Yorubas like (Seriki Kuku of Ijebu land) soon became Muslims with positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time like other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from Ọba Kosọkọ, after he came back from exile in Ẹpẹ. According to Gbadamọṣi (1972; 1978 in Eades, 1980) Islam soon spread to other Yoruba towns, especially, during the intra-tribal wars-when there was a high demand for Islamic teachers-who dubbed as both Quran teachers and amulet makers for Yoruba soldiers during the intra-tribal wars in Yoruba land. Islam, like Christianity also found a common ground with the natives that believed in Supreme Being, while there were some areas of disagreements, Islamic teachers impressed upon their audience the need to change from worshipping idols and embrace Allah. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Quranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam. Traditional shrines and ritual sites were replaced with Central Mosques in major Yoruba towns and cities.

===Maitatsine===

A fringe and heretical group, led by the cleric Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine, started in Kano in the late 1970s and operated throughout the 1980s. Maitatsine (since deceased) was from Cameroon, and claimed to have had divine revelations superseding those of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. With their own mosques and a doctrine antagonistic to established Islamic and societal leadership, its main appeal was to marginal and poverty-stricken urban in-migrants, whose rejection by the more established urban groups fostered this religious opposition. These disaffected adherents ultimately lashed out at the more traditional mosques and congregations, resulting in violent outbreaks in several cities of the north.

===Quranists===

Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or &#x27;Yan Kala Kato, are also present in Nigeria. &#x27;Yan Kala Kato is often mistaken for a militant group called Yan Tatsine (also known as Maitatsine), an unrelated group founded by Muhammadu Marwa. Marwa was killed in 1980. Marwa&#x27;s successor, Musa Makaniki, was arrested in 2004 and sentenced in 2006, but later released. And another leader of Yan Tatsine, Malam Badamasi, was killed in 2009. Notable Nigerian Quranists include Islamic scholars Mallam Saleh Idris Bello.

==Islam in Nigerian society==

As an institution in Northern Nigeria, Islam plays an important role in society. The five pillars of Islam, including the annual pilgrimage and daily prayers, are seen as important duties of Muslims. Support for the inclusion of a sharia legal system that governs family law and a religious view about modes of personal conduct has support within society.

According to Pew Research Center in 2010, Muslims in Nigeria overwhelmingly favoured Islam playing a large role in politics. A majority of Muslims in Nigeria favoured stoning and/or whipping adulterers, cutting off hands for crimes like theft or robbery, and the death penalty for those who abandon Islam.
Sheikh Adelabu has mentioned other aspects of culture influenced by Islam in Nigeria. He cited Arabic words used in Nigerian languages, especially Yoruba and Hausa names of the days such as Atalata (Ar. Ath-Thulatha الثلاثاء) for Tuesday, Alaruba (Ar. Al-Arbi&#x27;a الأربعاء) for Wednesday, Alamisi (Ar. Al-Khamis الخميس) for Thursday, and Jimoh (Ar. Al-Jum&#x27;ah الجمعة) for Friday. By far, Ojo Jimoh is the most favourably used. I usually preferred to the unpleasant Yoruba word for Friday Eti, which means Failure, Laziness or Abandonment. Maintaining that the wide adoption of Islamic faith and traditions has succeeded to lay impacts both on written and spoken Nigerian vernaculars, Sheikh Adelabu asserted nearly all technical terms and cultural usages of Hausa and Fulani were derived from Islamic heritages, citing a long list of Hausa words adopted from Arabic. In furthering supports for his claims, Sheikh Adelabu gave the following words to be Yoruba&#x27;s derivatives of Arabic vocabularies:
*Alaafia i.e. Good, Fine Or Healthy from derivative Al-Aafiah (Ar. العافية)
*Baale i.e. husband or spouse derived from Ba&#x27;al (Ar. بعل)
*Sanma i.e. heaven or sky adopted for Samaa` (Ar. السماء)
*Alubarika i.e. blessing used as Al-Barakah (Ar. البركة)
*Wakati i.e. hour or time formed from Waqt (Ar. وقت)
*Asiri i.e. Secrete or Hidden derivative of As-Sirr (Ar. السرّ)

=== Sharia law ===

In 2008, twelve states located in northern Nigeria had fully implemented Sharia law. The twelve states in northern Nigeria have populations where Muslims form the majority.

In 2014, homosexual men were targeted by &quot;Hisbah&quot;, the religious police. According to a member of the Sharia Commission, homosexuals should be killed by stoning, hanging or pushing them from a high place. In Nigeria, federal law criminalizes homosexual behaviour, but states with Sharia law imposed the death penalty.

=== Influence on culture ===
Historically, Islam fostered trade relations between North Africa and West Africa. Berbers traders from Tiaret during the Rustamid dynasty were involved in commerce with Audoghast. These trade routes went further south into the Kanuri and Hausa states of Northern Nigeria. Sharia was also introduced into Northern Nigeria as Islam spread across the region. In addition to law and trade, Islam had some influence in spreading the choice of dressing, language and choice of names.

Agbada dressing in West Africa is commonly associated with Muslims and Mallams, Iborun (neck covers) is worn by many Muslims in Southern Nigeria during prayers and crochet hats were once mostly worn by Muslims to had performed the pilgrimage. Some Hausa and Yoruba expressions and words are also influenced by Arabic, the language of the Koran. Assalam Alaykum is a familiar expression for greeting by Muslims and Allahu Akbar is used as a call to prayer. Names such as Mohammed, Ibrahim, Yunusa, Lamidi, Aliu and Suleiman are commonly given to Muslim children.

=== Nigerian Muslim Women and Hijab Politics ===
Among the half of the population that is Muslim, it&#x27;s estimated that about ⅓ of Muslim women in Nigeria wear the hijab. Despite this, there remains a divisive stance on whether hijab should be allowed to be worn by Muslim women and girls in schools, public spaces, and workplaces. Muslim women and girls who wear hijab and other forms of the veil including face coverings have reportedly faced persistent harassment and discrimination in both education and work settings over the last few years. A court decision banning the wearing of hijab in primary and secondary schools in Lagos State was upheld on October 17, 2014, with similar bans implemented formally and informally in other states and levels of institutions. However, the court decision was overturned two years later on July 21, 2016, ruling that “the ban on the use of hijab in public schools in the state was discriminatory against Muslim pupils.” The Lagos State government made another attempt to re-institute the ban in February of 2017 and was blocked, affirming the decision to uphold the right to hijab.

=== Traditional Islamic education ===

The practice of Almajiranci by students primarily from rural areas (who are called Almajiri—a transliteration of Al Muhajirun, the Arabic word for emigrant—. The almajiri system in Nigeria is highly controversial. The system has been attacked for promoting youth poverty and delinquency, for failing to teach young boys vocational skills and thus making them unequipped for the workforce, and for radicalizing boys and making them perfect recruits for gangs and Boko Haram. Others believe the almajiri system teaches young boys to be pious, good people who will benefit society.

== Extremism ==
In Nigeria, Pew Research polled the views of Muslims on extremist groups. 45% favoured Hezbollah, 49% favoured Hamas and 49% favoured Al-Qaeda. Unlike other Muslim countries, Nigeria was the only country where Muslims were positive towards Al-Qaeda.

=== Boko Haram ===

Boko Haram is a terrorist organisation. Its first attack was directed towards the Bauchi prison in 2009.

* On the night of 14–15 April 2014, 276 female students were kidnapped from the Government Secondary School in the town of Chibok in Borno State, Nigeria. Responsibility for the kidnappings was claimed by Boko Haram, an extremist terrorist organization based in northeastern Nigeria. 57 of the schoolgirls managed to escape over the next few months
*On the night of 5–6 May 2014, Boko Haram militants attacked the twin towns of Gamboru and Ngala in Borno State, Nigeria. Roughly 310 residents were killed in the 12-hour attack, and the town was largely destroyed.

* The 2014 Kano bombing was a terrorist attack on November 28, 2014, at the Central Mosque in Kano, Northern Nigeria, during the Boko Haram insurgency. The mosque, situated near the palace of the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, was targeted shortly after the Emir had urged civilians to defend themselves against Boko Haram.

The attack occurred during Friday prayers when three bombs exploded, killing over 120 Muslim worshippers and injuring 260 others. Two suicide bombers detonated their explosives, while gunmen opened fire on people trying to escape.

Witnesses reported that the two explosions happened in the mosque’s courtyard, with a third occurring on a nearby road. One witness noted that the imam was about to begin prayers when a car attempted to force its way into the mosque, and the occupant detonated the bombs after being stopped. This was among the deadliest attacks during the insurgency.

==Organisation of Nigerian Islam==
Sa&#x27;adu Abubakar, the 20th Sultan of Sokoto, is considered the spiritual leader of Nigeria&#x27;s Muslims.

Several Muslim organisations, lobbies and pressure groups exist, such as Nasfat, MPAC Nigeria and the Muslim Rights Concern.

<text>Nidelva is a river in Trondheim Municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. The name of the long river translates to &quot;the River Nid&quot; since the suffix &quot;elva&quot; or &quot;elven&quot; is the Norwegian word for &quot;the river&quot;.

==Location==
The Nidelva starts at the Hyttfossen waterfall which rises from Bjørsjøen, a small lake located just below Selbusjøen, the largest lake in the southern part of Trøndelag County. The Nidelva runs north through Klæbu, then to Tiller, and then through the city of Trondheim before reaching Trondheimsfjord by the island of Brattøra near Trondheim Central Station. The Nidelva is at its deepest at the Trongfossen, a deep ravine in the village of Klæbu. There are six hydro-electric power stations along the river. The Nidelva forms the last part of the Nea-Nidelvvassdraget watershed. The Nea River is a tributary which empties into Selbusjøen, which in turn flows into the Nidelva.

The popular Norwegian waltz, &quot;Nidelven Stille og Vakker du er&quot; (), was written by composer Oskar Hoddø (1916–1943). According to tradition, Hoddø wrote the waltz about the Nidelva River one night in late April 1940 while he was standing at Gamle Bybro in Trondheim.

<text>Cristian Alberto &#x27;Kily&#x27; González Peret (born 4 August 1974) is an Argentine football manager and former professional player who played mainly as a left winger, and is the manager of Unión.

He started his career with Rosario Central, which he would represent in three different spells, moving to Spain in 1996 where he appeared for Zaragoza and Valencia, amassing La Liga totals of 182 matches and 23 goals during seven seasons and winning the national championship with the latter. He also played in two consecutive UEFA Champions League finals (1999–2000, 2000–01) and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year in 2001. He left Valencia in 2003, spending three years in Italy with Inter Milan before returning to the Argentine league.

González&#x27;s spell in the Argentina national team lasted for ten years, in which he was selected for the 2002 World Cup and two Copa América tournaments, for a total of 56 caps, scoring 9 goals.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in Rosario, Santa Fe, González started playing with local Rosario Central, making his Argentine Primera División debut on 18 December 1993 in a 0–2 away loss against Gimnasia.

After two years, he moved to Boca Juniors, spending the 1995–96 season there, playing alongside Diego Maradona.

===Spain===
In 1996, González was transferred to Real Zaragoza. He appeared in his first game in La Liga on 8 September, playing 19 minutes in a 2–1 win against Sevilla and, during his three-year spell in Aragon, shared teams with countryman Gustavo López who was also a winger.

Subsequently, González joined fellow league club Valencia for 1,300 million pesetas, being teammate to also Argentines Pablo Aimar and Roberto Ayala for several seasons and contributing with 31 matches and two goals in the 2001–02 campaign as his team won the league title after a 31-year wait. Following the emergence of younger Vicente, he became surplus to requirements – only 13 appearances and 546 minutes of action in his last year, which also included a run-in with manager Rafael Benítez– and left the &quot;Che&quot; as a free agent; additionally, he amassed UEFA Champions League combined totals of 31 matches and five goals, as they reached the final in 2000 and 2001, and was granted Spanish nationality in early January 2001.

===Inter===
In summer 2003, González followed former Valencia coach Héctor Cuper to Inter Milan, and again shared teams with several compatriots.

He was used mainly as a substitute during his tenure, playing 75 official games and failing to find the net.

===Return home===
Aged 32, González returned to his country and Rosario Central, going on to still be an important first-team member during three top flight seasons. On 4 August 2009, he joined San Lorenzo who was managed by former national teammate Diego Simeone; after the former&#x27;s relegation, however, he decided to rejoin for a third spell and help in the Primera B Nacional campaign, following which he retired at 37.

In June 2020, after over a year in charge of its reserve team, González became Rosario Central&#x27;s manager on an 18-month contract. On his debut on 3 November, the club won 2–1 at home to Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba.

González led Central to the quarter-finals of the Copa Sudamericana in 2021, losing 5–3 on aggregate to Brazil&#x27;s Red Bull Bragantino in August. The following 20 March, after a derby defeat to Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, he was dismissed.

==International career==
An Argentine international since 1995, González made his debut on 8 November in a 0–1 home defeat to Brazil. He was selected by manager Marcelo Bielsa for his 1999 Copa América squad, scoring one of his nine goals in the nation&#x27;s 2–0 group stage win against Uruguay as the former went on to reach the quarter-finals only to be eliminated by eventual champions Brazil. He went on to become a regular member of the starting eleven under that coach, and also participated in the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, starting against England (and being replaced) and also appearing against Nigeria and Sweden in an eventual group stage exit.

Two years later, again under Bielsa, González was selected for the 2004 Summer Olympics tournament as one of three overaged players. He featured in all games and scored in the opener against Serbia (6–0), helping the &quot;Albiceleste&quot; win gold in Athens.

González also took part in the 2004 Copa América, netting three times in the tournament: his first two came in the group stage, in Argentina&#x27;s victories against Ecuador and Uruguay, and his last was a penalty in regulation time in the final against Brazil, which eventually ended in a shootout loss with the player again converting his attempt.

==Style of play==
González was a quick, strong and versatile midfielder, who was capable of playing both as a winger and as an attacking midfielder. His main attributes were his technical ability, vision, range of passing, determination and his powerful and accurate striking ability from distance, which enabled him both to create and score goals.

<doc id="1186391" wikidata="Q2293448" url="?curid=1186391" title="Tenchi Muyo! GXP">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series animated by AIC and broadcast on NTV from April 3 to September 25, 2002. It is the fourth installment of the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; line of series, succeeding &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo&quot;, localized in North America by Funimation. On November 11, 2012, it began airing on Adult Swim&#x27;s revived Toonami programming block. An anime OVA project titled &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP Paradise Shidō-hen&quot; by AIC and Saber Project premiered in May 2023.

==Plot==
Seina Yamada is a young Japanese high school student living with his parents and younger sister in rural Okayama, Japan. One morning, following a hapless bike ride through the country, a large spacecraft crashes into the lake behind the Masaki residence, causing a violent tsunami that Seina is unable to escape from and he sinks, almost drowning. He regains consciousness shortly after, meeting Amane Kaunaq, the spacecraft&#x27;s pilot, who gives Seina an application. Seina takes it, and shows it to his family at home. Mistaking it for a contest entry, his mother and sister aggressively force him to fill it out; afterwards he retreats to his room and falls asleep. The following morning, awakened aboard a vessel in orbit, Seina is informed by an official that he has successfully joined the Galaxy Police. It also revealed that the Galaxy Police originally meant to recruit Tenchi, but they got Seina instead.

===Setting===
Unlike &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; and &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo&quot;, which are spin-offs of &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki&quot;, &quot;GXP&quot; occurs during the same time period, making it a parallel series to the show. As such, the more-recognized cast do not play central roles, though they do make cameo appearances.

==Characters==
: 
:The unlikely protagonist of the series, Seina, a fifteen-year-old high school student with a supernatural penchant for bad luck (for himself AND for anyone around him), is mistakenly enlisted to the Galaxy Police after being coerced to fill out an application, which was meant to be given to Tenchi (his role model, who he addresses as &quot;senpai&quot;). His ultimate decision is to enroll, finding that, in the company of others and as the captain of his own ship, his otherwise unfortunate talent proves incredibly useful in rounding up pirates and other lawbreakers (leading to his nickname &#x27;Lorelei Seina&#x27;, as he is something of a siren in his ability to attract pirates).
: 
:Amane is a twenty-year-old Galaxy Police Detective 2nd Class whose crash-landing on Earth at the start of the series is solely responsible for the events that later ensue. Her mission was to give the application to Tenchi, but she mistook Seina as Tenchi&#x27;s apprentice. In spite of her justified decision to give Seina an application, her long-awaited promotion to Detective 1st Class was postponed and she was temporarily re-assigned as a GP Academy instructor for the semester in order to personally supervise and train Seina. With a genuine crush and empathy for the boy, Amane grows to like her new responsibility, becoming Ship&#x27;s Weapons Specialist (Tactical Officer) when Seina is given command of, first, the &quot;Kamidake&quot; and then later the &quot;Kamidake II&quot;, and the group are assigned their own patrol.
: 
:Kiriko is a twenty-four-year-old Immigration Officer for the Galaxy Police, whose double life in the agency is completely unknown to her family and peers on Earth (save for her mother and of-age members of the Masaki Village). Having grown up around Seina and developed a sympathy for his misfortune, she is the one most familiar with him and self-assigns herself the role of being his legal guardian and caretaker when he is accepted to the academy. In a manner identical to that of Amane (but with a suspicion that Lady Seto is behind it as a way to keep her close to Seina), she too is re-assigned to the GP Academy as an instructor for the semester. She becomes Ship&#x27;s OS Officer when Seina is given command of, first, the &quot;Kamidake&quot; and then later the &quot;Kamidake II&quot;, and the group are assigned their own patrol.
: 
:Ryoko is a nineteen-year-old space pirate captain and member of the notorious Da Ruma guild, who in spite of her ruthless profile, exhibits behavior quite the opposite of her profession (even becoming something of a celebrity among GP members). She is introduced to Seina early into his travel to the academy, bestowing a humble, competitive respect for him when his paranormal luck aids in the arrest of several dozen pirate ships. Her admiration for him develops into a more passionate one, however, and Ryoko finds herself caught between her feelings and her allegiance to the guild (especially when the families of her crew are held hostage). However, events work out for the best and she becomes not only a full-member of the GP but also Ship&#x27;s Pilot when Seina is given command of, first, the &quot;Kamidake&quot; and then later the &quot;Kamidake II&quot;, and the group are assigned their own patrol. As a part of her body enhancement (performed when she was a newborn), Ryoko is able to transmute her body to assume other guises, including the Wau Erma and a mermaid. Her parents named her after the legendary Ryoko Hakubi, the only space pirate to have ever taken-on planet Jurai&#x27;s defences.
: 
:Neju, contrary to her stature and demeanor, is a two-thousand-year-old former priestess of Melmas, a distant planet of religious psychics. Following a brief, unelaborate encounter with Seina, she makes a more established presence when he and the group are asked to escort her aboard their ship. To the blatant annoyance of the other girls, she immediately grows fond of Seina, treating him as an older brother figure and even making plans to marry him. Having fulfilled her term as Melmas&#x27; high-priestess, Neju accepts Lady Seto&#x27;s suggestion to enlist at the GP Academy, rather than return to secular life back on Melmas, as there was a hit on her. After a brief course at the Academy, Neju is assigned to the &quot;Kamidake II&quot;, and the group are assigned their own patrol.
: 
:Fuku is an infantile cabbit, developed as the nucleus of Seina&#x27;s succeeding vessel, the Kamidake II. As the heart and powerhouse of the ship, Fuku exercises superseding control over its entirety, most notably its energy output, which is influenced by her emotional vigor. She is initially troubled by the stress of belligerence, stunting her from exercising full potential, but soon thanks to Seina&#x27;s affection and support (later backed by that of the other girls) finds the strength to rise to the occasion and become a vital member of the crew.
; NB
:NB was originally a &quot;NB Reasoning Unit&quot; A.I. helper robot, specifically a new test model likely modified for Seina (according to Seina&#x27;s dormmates, Kenneth and Rajau), that Seina was issued when he enrolled in the G.P. Academy. During Seina&#x27;s re-training after his body-enhancement, Kiriko and Erma (Ryoko), not trusting Amane alone with Seina, added a video camera for surveillance; however, a short circuit, caused by Amane&#x27;s modifications and some weird extra installed programming, altered the personality of the robot. NB&#x27;s still the helper robot it was originally designed for, but now it has the personality and motivations of a voyeuristic pervert. NB is almost never found without its camera, hoping to catch girls in various stages of undress (and a weird obsession with &quot;chikuwa&quot; (a Japanese fish sausage)). Unfortunately for NB, the girls usually do catch it, and the end result is NB getting dented. He finally meets his match in Nabiko, a female version of himself that has been programmed to be &quot;intimate&quot; with him and which, despite his desperate attempts to flee from her, finally catches him and makes him, to his horror, &quot;impure&quot;. In the series&#x27; epilogue, it is shown that he ends up the father to a huge family of little NB&#x27;s and a henpecked husband.
: 
:Airi Masaki was first introduced in the third series of the &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki&quot; OVA and becomes a regular member of the &quot;Techi Muyo! GXP&quot; cast in Episode 4. She is Tenchi Masaki&#x27;s grandmother, but anyone mentioning the fact that she is a grandmother had better run fast...she never likes to hear that she is a grandmother; Seina found this out when, as part of a joke played on him by Amane, he called Airi &#x27;Granny&#x27; when her back was turned to him. When Seina found out, he was terrified (mostly because Airi was holding a chef&#x27;s knife at the time), and she made him write lines as punishment.
:She is the chairwoman for the Galaxy Police Academy and works closely with the Academy&#x27;s headmistress Mikami Kuramitsu. She also has a love for cooking, and would be found in one of the GP Academy&#x27;s restaurants practicing her skills. While a tough but fair administrator, she demonstrates some affection for Seina (feeling jealous of Seto for being able to hang around with Seina while she (Airi) is stuck doing paperwork and crying out for Seina to come back to regular GP duty when she gets overwhelmed by the mountains of paperwork) and shows respect for his being able to take Tarant Shank out by himself.
: 
:Lady Seto is the mother of Empress Misaki, the adopted mother of Noike Jurai, the grandmother of Ayeka and Sasami and a very powerful &#x27;behind the scenes&#x27; figure in Juraian politics...so much that because of her political craftiness and occasionally violent temper, she is referred to as &quot;The Devil Princess of Jurai&quot;. She is married to the Kamiki clan head Utsutsumi Kamiki.
:Her tree/ship, Mikagami, is known for her special attack: The Triple Z (AKA the &quot;Genocidal Dance&quot;), which literally causes all enemies to freeze in their tracks; either due to an Electromagnetic Pulse or some other mechanism (though the effect of this is left to the viewer&#x27;s imagination) followed by almost total obliteration, and this attack is as much feared by her allies as her enemies because of her enjoyment of using it. Due to her past (see her entry in &quot;List of Tenchi Muyo! supporting characters&quot;, she has an intense hatred of pirates.
:Seto has a reputation as an unofficial &quot;matchmaker&quot; in the Jurai empire and has been known to arrange marriages either to cement alliances or just to see happens for her own amusement. She is behind the four-bride wedding at the close of the series,
:While a lesser character in the &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki&quot; series, Lady Seto has a bigger and more influential role in &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot;, first meeting Seina Yamada when his transport ship was under attack by pirates. Seeing how Seina&#x27;s bad luck could be useful not only for the GP but for herself, she effectively takes Seina under her wing by helping him enter the GP Academy (feeling like the academy could use a little chaos once in a while) and requesting Mikami Kuramitsu to have Kiriko Masaki reassigned as an instructor at the Academy in order to train Seina to become a man. She enjoy teasing Seina (by sending her handmaidens to romantically harass him and once even offering to scrub his back!) but also has a great respect for him and seems to enjoy that Seina is a constant surprise to her: first, in their initial encounter by rounding up a huge batch of pirate ships that the Juraian fleet hadn&#x27;t been able to capture for months; next, by dealing with the Daluma pirate guild&#x27;s Good Luck Fleet in the first encounter (after it had escaped from her own fleet); finally, by bringing back the mecha that he found on the Wau planet, which turned out to contain a first generation Juraian seed and which meant that since the seed had bonded with Seina, he was now part of the Jurai royal family and third in line for the throne. Seto is suspected of being aware of her handmaidens&#x27; true loyalties when they kidnap Seina and prefers to see how the chase turns out rather than interfere.
: 
:Mitoto Kuramitsu is the daughter of Minami, as well as the mother of Mihoshi and Misao. Mitoto works as an extremely enthusiastic sanitation engineer (cleaning lady) for the Galaxy Police. She met Seina when he was first taken from Earth to the GP Academy, and was taken by Seina&#x27;s hair, which she constantly pets. Since then, Mitoto would be occasionally popping into Seina&#x27;s life from time-to-time, often helping him out during certain events in the boy&#x27;s life.
: &quot;(Toonami version; the redub was necessary due to Seiryo&#x27;s original English voice sounding too effeminate).
:After his humiliating &quot;defeat&quot; by Tenchi Masaki, Seiryō developed a personal hatred for all Earthlings, a grudge which would continue on into &quot;Tenchi Muyō! GXP&quot;. He holds a teacher&#x27;s position at the Galaxy Police Academy, and immediately develops a distaste for the human Seina Yamada when he becomes a cadet.
:Seina becomes Seiryō&#x27;s unwitting nemesis, constantly foiling his endless idiotic plots for revenge (mostly through Seina&#x27;s streak of bad luck). Having rebounded from his missed shot at Ayeka, Seiryō becomes infatuated again by childhood acquaintance Amane, despite being frequently and violently rejected; her attachment to Seina only serves to deepen his hatred for the young recruit, so much so that in Episode 6, Seiryō deliberately holds up the necessary body augmentation that Seina needed to at least survive life at the academy. However, Mikami Kuramitsu found out and punished Seriyō by assigning him to clean toilets... with her niece Mitoto supervising.
:Seiryō is brash and overconfident, often severely embarrassing himself through acts of sheer incompetence. However, he is also an accomplished fighter, and is quite proficient with a lightsword.
:After Amane allowed him to be captured by Kyo Komachi&#x27;s pirates in Episode 9, Seiryō learns during Episode 18 that, after long haggling over the ransom, the Tennan family has instead signed a supply contract with the Daluma pirate guild; Seiryō follows his father&#x27;s orders to assist the pirates (his family&#x27;s motto being &quot;The Customer/Client is God!&quot; (&quot;Otokui Kami-Sama wa&quot; (&quot;御得大神は&quot;))) and becomes the captain of the Daluma guild&#x27;s new anti-Seina Good Luck Fleet, constructing the Fleet&#x27;s flagship, Seiryo becomes the captain of the Daluma guild&#x27;s anti-Seina Good Luck Fleet&#x27;s flagship; in a stunning display of idiocy, Seriyō names his flagship &quot;Unko&quot; after all the other ships in the Daluma guild&#x27;s anti-Seina Good Luck Fleet&#x27;s flagship had taken many of the &quot;perfect good luck names&quot;. (運呼, &quot;Unko&quot; which could mean &quot;Luck Bringer&quot; in Japanese... is also translated as , lit. &quot;poop&quot;, a childish word for &quot;excrement&quot;, when spoken aloud).
:After fighting the G.P. ship &quot;Kamidake II&quot; to a standstill twice, Lady Seto decides to resolve the whole situation by issuing a challenge to Seiryō in Seina&#x27;s name to an official duel. However, during the duel when Seina slips on a piece of candy, his Shock Baton gets caught in Seiryō&#x27;s belt and loosens it completely, causing Seiryō&#x27;s pants to fall down and exposing his red &quot;fundoshi&quot; (loincloth) and costing Seiryō another match via embarrassment.
:At the end of the series, Seiryō works as the head waiter at a space station behind Earth&#x27;s moon, where Seina&#x27;s wedding was being held, as the station was owned by the Tennan family. While there, he encounters space pirate and former captor Kyō Komachi, and proposes to her after revealing that it was her birthday.
: 
:Tarant Shank is one of the main antagonists from &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; and becomes the main villain in Episode 10. He is a member of the dreaded Daluma Guild, but is also the most bloodthirsty and cruel of all the pirates, feared by both the Galaxy Police and his peers. He is captain of the &quot;Daidalos&quot;, and though sadistic enough to pass up an easy kill to instill more terror in his prey, is a survivalist and cowardly at heart, using others (even his own subordinates) as a shield when plans go awry and he has to escape.
:Shank has a grudge against GP officer Seina Yamada before ever meeting him, namely because his &quot;incompetent old man&quot; was captured in Seina&#x27;s first great lure before he actually arrived at the GP Academy, and continues his vendetta against Seina throughout the series, but, whether because of Seina&#x27;s bad-luck which affects pirates or for some other reason, Tarant usually winds up on the losing end of each encounter, also losing a part of his body which is cybernetically replaced. Another source of his rage is because of his further fall from grace after a loss to Seiryo with light swords, upending his chances of commanding the newest flagship of the Daluma fleet and causing him to strike out on his own. He later forms an alliance with a rogue faction within the Galaxy Army to abduct Fuku and the &quot;Kamidake II&quot; in order to learn the ship&#x27;s secrets, but is thwarted again by Seina and though injured manages to flee. He makes a final attempt on Seina&#x27;s life on the boy&#x27;s wedding day, but is trapped and captured single-handedly by Seina.
; Kyo Komachi
:Kyo Komachi is a pirate captain and member of the Daluma Pirate Guild. Physically, she is very commanding, extremely tall and muscular with indigo hair, and is one of the more sensible and honorable members of the Guild. She first appears in Episode 9 when her ship attacks the training vessel captained by Seiryo Tennan that Seina is serving on. Her light-sword battle with Seiryo is cut short when the ship&#x27;s systems go haywire and she and Seiryo are enveloped in sealant gel, but Seina&#x27;s quick action keeps them all from being drowned in the gel and earns her respect. Since she and Seiryo are intertwined in the gel, her crew are unable to cut her free without harming Seiryo, so they are forced to take him with them when they escape; however, in gratitude for Seina&#x27;s saving her life, she warns him about Tarant. When Ryoko is ordered by the Guild to have Seina assassinated, she strongly objects and later uses an arranged escape by Seiryo as a distraction to cover her rescue of the families of Ryoko&#x27;s crew that Shank was holding hostage. She becomes Seiryo&#x27;s second-in-command when he joins the Daluma Guild and is given command of the &quot;Unko&quot; (a name she desperately tries to keep him from announcing out loud, since it translates as &quot;excrement&quot;), and tries to provide some sense of stability (since Seiryo as a pirate captain is, to put it mildly, somewhat unstable). She accompanies him when he goes to face Seina in a one-on-one duel, but asks Seina privately to just play along with Seiryo. After Fuku and the &quot;Kamidake&quot; are taken by rogue Galaxy Army personnel, she provides information that aids Kiriko, Amane, Ryoko and Neiju in locating them and Seina (who has gone in pursuit on his own). In the final episode, it is revealed that Seina&#x27;s wedding day is the same date as her birthday and she and Seiryo begin a personal (romantic) relationship.

===Minor characters===
: (Alan)
: (Berry)
: (Cohen)
:Alan, Barry, and Cohen are recurring characters in Tenchi Muyo! GXP. These three made their appearance in the second episode. All three of them were on board the G.P. cruiser that had picked up Seina to transport him to the G.P. Academy. It was during the trip that they ran into Ryoko Balta&#x27;s ship, where they immediately &quot;surrendered&quot;. It turns out that the three are rabid fans of the space pirate, but were crushed when she took a liking to Seina. When Seina was given command of the original &quot;Kamidake&quot;, they became part of his crew, but were later reassigned to another GP ship. When that ship was captured by pirates, they gave themselves up as hostages to save the rest of the crew, but because of the gorgeous pirate girls switched their allegiance to the Daluma pirate guild, even eventually serving on board Seriyo Tennan&#x27;s ship &quot;Unko&quot;.
: (Kenneth Barl)
: (Rajau Ga Waura)
:Kenneth Barl, a human, and Rajau Ga Waura, a Wau, were Seina&#x27;s classmates and roommates at the GP Academy. Occasionally, the two would be featured in some point in Seina&#x27;s life in the GP, sometimes monitoring a satellite guarding Earth, mostly to protect members of the Jurai Royal family living there. Rajau became enamored of Erma, never realizing that Erma was one of Ryoko Balta&#x27;s guises.

==Production==
&quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; was officially announced on January 10, 2001 with a scheduled broadcast set for spring of the following year. When asked to direct the series, Shinichi Watanabe, though welcome to the opportunity, was cited as saying that he was unsure why he had been chosen, and that after watching previous &quot;Tenchi&quot; episodes, found the task of envisioning &quot;GXP&quot; to be &quot;tough&quot;.

First looks into the series was published on October 10 by &quot;Tenchi-Web.com&quot;, showcasing artwork and teaser trailer. More trailers were progressively added from November 2001 to February 2002 when it was announced on February 18 that &quot;GXP&quot; would premier on NTV on April 2. &quot;Tenchi-web&quot; then, a day later, scheduled a preview screening of the first and second episodes in Tokyo. In a similar fashion, Los Angeles based Anime Expo confirmed the attendance of Mamiko Noto, voice actress for the series, and that AIC would host a screening of &quot;GXP&quot; at the convention. Funimation later confirmed from Anime Expo New York that they had secured the licensing rights to the show.

&quot;GXP&quot; finished airing on September 24. Following a nine-month period, Funimation unveiled the official English website for the series on June 16, 2003, later confirming its release for March 4, 2004.

A new anime project titled &quot;Tenchi Muyo GXP Paradise Starting&quot; was announced by EXNOA on December 23, 2022. It was later confirmed that the project would be an OVA series animated by AIC and Saber Project and directed by Takashi Asami, with Hiroshi Negishi serving as chief director, Hideki Shirane writing and supervising series&#x27; scripts, Nana Hiiragi designing the characters and Digital Network Animation credited for animation production assistance. The series ran for six episodes released on a monthly basis, and the first episode was released on May 26, 2023. Crunchyroll licensed the series.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; aired on Colours TV&#x27;s Funimation block in 2006 from June 24 to September 17. Also aired in Hawaii on KIKU starting September 2006. Aired periodically on Funimation Channel.

It began airing on Adult Swim&#x27;s newly revived Toonami programming block on November 11, 2012 at 12:30 a.m. ET where it remained for 3 weeks until it was bumped to 1 a.m. to make way for Naruto, which claimed the 12:30 a.m. slot. 2 weeks later, it was moved to 3 a.m. due to lower than expected ratings where it remained for the rest of its run. &quot;GXP&quot; is the fourth &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; series to air on Toonami (the original OVAs, &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot; and &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo&quot; having been aired on the original Toonami in an edited form).

==Reception==
&quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; was met with mostly positive reception. It was initially believed that the premiere would not draw noteworthy attention, but the midnight screening of the first episode on September 9 reportedly garnered a 4.0% viewing share, a figure considered double that of other premiers such as &quot;Aquarian Age&quot; and &quot;Kanon&quot;.

The localization of &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; was met with generally positive reception as well. In a report by Right Stuf International on February 28, AIC became flooded with so much mail from American fans about its release that the company requested fans stop. Industry aggregator &quot;Mania.com&quot; gave the commercial releases ratings A through B, citing that &quot;the GXP series was a lot of fun&quot; but that &quot;[it] was over by the time you really get into it.&quot; &quot;Animefringe.com&quot;, an online magazine, published a positive review as well, citing a &quot;well balanced storyline&quot; and that &quot;GXP&quot; &quot;still has plenty of potential to go forward and compete in today&#x27;s booming anime world after its long absence from the spotlight.&quot;

==Media==

=== Anime ===
===Manga===

Masaki Kajishima, original creator of the &quot;Tenchi&quot; series, wrote and illustrated a manga for &quot;GXP&quot;, serialized in &quot;Comic Dragon&quot; (now &quot;Monthly Dragon Age&quot;) from June to September 2002. It was collected into a single volume and published by Kadokawa Shoten on August 29, 2002.

===Novels===
In addition to the manga, Kajishima also writes an ongoing light novel series retelling &quot;GXP&quot; from his perspective. The books were published by Kadokawa Shoten and go into more detail than the anime. The first volume was released on April 25, 2003. As of June 11, 2021, 17 books have been released.

==Plot==
During the American Civil War in 1863, Amy, a 12-year-old student at the Miss Martha Farnsworth Seminary for Young Ladies in rural Mississippi, discovers a seriously wounded Union soldier, John McBurney. She brings him to the school&#x27;s gated enclosure where the school headmistress, Martha Farnsworth, first insists on turning him over to Confederate troops, but then decides to restore him to health first. He is initially kept locked in the school&#x27;s music room and kept under watch. Edwina, the schoolteacher who has had no experience with men, takes an immediate liking to John, as does Carol, a 17-year-old student who makes advances with an experienced air.

John begins to bond with each of the women in the house, including the slave Hallie. As he charms each of them, the sexually repressed atmosphere of the school becomes filled with jealousy and deceit, and the women begin to turn on one another. After Carol, who earlier made a welcomed pass at John, witnesses John kissing Edwina in the garden, she ties a blue rag to the school&#x27;s entrance gate to alert the Confederate troops to the presence of a Yankee soldier. When a band of Confederate soldiers see it while passing the school, Martha lies and helps John pretend he is a relative loyal to the Confederacy.

Martha also becomes infatuated with John, and a flashback shows her having an incestuous relationship with her brother. Martha considers keeping John at the school as a handyman. She makes sexual advances toward him, which he resists.

Late one night, Edwina discovers John having sex with Carol in her bedroom. In a jealous rage, she beats him with a candlestick, causing him to fall down the staircase and break his leg severely. Martha insists he will die of gangrene unless they amputate his leg. The women carry him to the kitchen where they tie him to the table. Martha saws off his leg at the knee. When John awakens and learns that his leg has been amputated, he goes into a fury, convinced that Martha performed the operation as revenge for his rejection of her sexual advances.

John, again under lock and key, convinces Carol to unlock his door. He sneaks from his room into Martha&#x27;s and steals a pistol and some personal items of Martha&#x27;s including some letters from her brother. Convinced that Martha plans to hold him prisoner, John confronts Martha at gunpoint, claiming control of the house and declaring his intention to have his way with any of the women or girls. He gets drunk and then confronts the entire household, revealing that he read Martha&#x27;s letters and that they implicate Martha and her brother in an incestuous relationship. In a fit of anger he also accidentally kills Amy&#x27;s pet turtle, which he immediately regrets and apologizes for, to no avail, as Amy professes her hatred of him. Edwina follows John to his room and professes her love for him. They begin to kiss and it is later implied that they had sex.

Meanwhile, Martha convinces the others (except for Edwina, who is not present) that they need to kill John to prevent him from denouncing them to Union troops who have made camp within sight of the school. Martha asks Amy to pick mushrooms they can prepare &quot;especially for him&quot; and Amy says she knows just where to find some. At dinner, John apologizes for his actions, and Edwina reveals that she and John have made plans to leave the school and marry. John has been eating the mushrooms and the others pass the bowl without taking any except for Edwina. When she starts to eat some, Martha cries out for her to stop. John realizes he has been poisoned, leaves the dining room disoriented, and collapses in the hallway. The following day, the women sew his corpse into a burial shroud and carry him out of the gate to bury. They agree he died of exhaustion, and Amy denies she could ever pick a poisonous mushroom by mistake.

==Production==
Clint Eastwood was given a copy of the 1966 novel by producer Jennings Lang, and was engrossed throughout the night in reading it. This was the first of several films where Eastwood agreed to storylines where nubile females look at him adoringly (including minors in this film and &quot;Pale Rider&quot;). Eastwood considered the film as &quot;an opportunity to play true emotions and not totally operatic and not lighting cannons with cigars&quot;. Albert Maltz was brought in to draft the script, but disagreements in the end led to a revision of the script by Claude Traverse, who although uncredited, led to Maltz being credited under a pseudonym. Maltz had originally written a script with a happy ending, in which Eastwood&#x27;s character and the girl live happily ever after. Both Eastwood and director Don Siegel felt that an ending faithful to that of the book would be a stronger anti-war statement, and Eastwood&#x27;s character would be killed. The film, according to Siegel, deals with the themes of sex, violence and vengeance, and was based around &quot;the basic desire of women to castrate men&quot; though the central theme was the impact of a man having sex with multiple women.

Jeanne Moreau was considered for the role of the domineering Martha Farnsworth, but the role went to Geraldine Page, and actresses Elizabeth Hartman, Jo Ann Harris, Darlene Carr, Mae Mercer, and Pamelyn Ferdin were cast in supporting roles.

Universal initially wanted Siegel to film at a studio at Disney Studios Ranch, but Siegel preferred to have it filmed at an antebellum estate near Baton Rouge, Louisiana in Ascension Parish: the Ashland-Belle Helene Plantation, a historic house built in 1841, that was a plantation estate and home of Duncan Farrar Kenner. Portions of the interiors were filmed at Universal Studios. Filming started in April 1970 and lasted 10 weeks.

Eastwood had signed a long-term contract with Universal but became angry with the studio because he felt that they botched its release. This eventually led to his leaving the studio in 1975 after the release of &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot;, which he directed as well as starred in. He would not work with Universal again until 2008&#x27;s &quot;Changeling&quot;.

Eastwood said of his role in &quot;The Beguiled&quot;,

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is not, indeed, successful as baroque melodrama, and, towards the end, there are so many twists and turns of plot and character that everything that&#x27;s gone before is neutralized. People who consider themselves discriminating moviegoers, but who are uncommitted to Mr. Siegel will be hard put to accept it, other than as a sensational, misogynistic nightmare.&quot; A negative review in &quot;Variety&quot; said that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t come off, and the apparent attempt to mesh Charles Addams style with Tennessee Williams-type material cues audience laughter in all the wrong places.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that Siegel &quot;unfortunately elects to tell his story with a broad and leering humor that at times is barely distinguishable from a sexploitation shocker.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised &quot;The Beguiled&quot; as &quot;a film of psychological suspense laced with dark humor that is a triumph of style, totally engrossing and utterly convincing.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; slammed the film as &quot;anything but beguiling. Weird, yes; trashy, yes; pathetic, yes; beguiling, no.&quot; Nigel Andrews of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;a film that works best when it is most outrageous. Geraldine Page&#x27;s piously neurotic Miss Martha and Elizabeth Hartman&#x27;s sickly Edwina hover on the brink of self-parody for most of the film, and are pushed well over in Siegel&#x27;s climactic dream sequence, which begins with multiple-exposure effects and triangular embraces and ends with a shot of the two women supporting a limply naked Eastwood in the pose of Van Der Weyden&#x27;s &#x27;Pieta&#x27; (which hangs ambiguously on Page&#x27;s bedroom wall).&quot;

The film received major recognition in France, and was proposed by Pierre Rissient to the Cannes Film Festival, and while agreed to by Eastwood and Siegel, the producers declined. It would be widely screened in France later and is considered one of Eastwood&#x27;s finest works by the French. The film was poorly marketed and in the end grossed little over $1 million, earning less than a fourth of what &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; did at the same time and falling to below 50 in the charts within two weeks of release.

Made right before &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, this was a bold early attempt by Eastwood to play against type. It was not a hit, likely due to uncertainty on Universal&#x27;s part concerning how to market it, eventually leading them to advertise the film as a hothouse melodrama: &quot;One man...seven women...in a strange house!&quot; &quot;His love... or his life...&quot; According to Eastwood and Jennings Lang, the film, aside from being poorly publicized, flopped due to Eastwood&#x27;s being &quot;emasculated in the film&quot;. The film&#x27;s poster, for example, shows him with a gun, suggesting an action movie, but the only action consists of a few seconds of flashback to Eastwood&#x27;s character in battle before being wounded.

Quentin Tarantino later wrote the movie &quot;was the closest Siegel ever came to making an art film... and truth be told, as good as it is, as its director, he&#x27;s miscast. While the offbeat film is ultimately successful, it does bring out Siegel&#x27;s worst stylistic impulses. His fondness for Freudian imagery, his literalness in a tale that screams for ambiguity (a dream sequence in the middle makes explicit everything that had only been suggested). However, once Siegel settles down and focuses on Eastwood, the film comes alive.&quot;

&quot;The Beguiled&quot; holds a 90% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.3/10.Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

==Theme==
Even when faced with Siegel&#x27;s contentious statement about women, film critic Judith M. Kass probes deeper to uncover elements of feminism within &#x27;The Beguiled&#x27;, presenting an alternate perspective:

Kass continues: “The women in &quot;The Beguiled&quot; are not all bad; they are hard-pressed, unused to the lives they are leading, victimized by events they had not had in shaping, sexually thwarted at the stages in their development when they should be freest. They can trust no friend, let alone foe: the Confederates who offer to guard them obviously have rape in mind and the Yankee in their midst acts like the master of a private seraglio. Why shouldn’t they become desperate, say and do things that wouldn&#x27;t under ordinary circumstances?”

==Other film adaptations==

Sofia Coppola wrote and directed a film based on the same source material with Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning. It had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2017. The film was released by Focus Features on June 23, 2017.

<doc id="1186396" wikidata="Q2976612" url="?curid=1186396" title="Islam in Kyrgyzstan">
<text>The vast majority of people in Kyrgyzstan are Muslims; as of 2020, 90% of the country&#x27;s population were followers of Islam. Muslims in Kyrgyzstan are generally of the Sunni branch, mostly of the Hanafi school, which entered the region during the eighth century. Most Kyrgyz Muslims practice their religion in a specific way influenced by shamanic tribal customs. There has been a revival of Islamic practices since independence in Kyrgyzstan. For the most part religious leaders deal only with issues of religion and do not reach out to communities, but rather offer services to those who come to the mosque. There are regional differences, with the southern part of the country being more religious. Kyrgyzstan remained a secular state after the fall of communism, which had only superficial influence on religious practice when Kyrgyzstan was a Soviet republic, despite the policy of state atheism. Most of the Russian population of Kyrgyzstan is Russian Orthodox. The Uzbeks, who make up 14.9 percent of the population, are generally Sunni Muslims.

==The introduction of Islam==

Islam was introduced to the Kyrgyz tribes between the eighth and twelfth centuries. More recent exposure to Islam occurred in the seventeenth century, when the Jungars drove the Kyrgyz of the Tian Shan region into the Fergana Valley, whose population was totally Islamic. However, as the danger from the Jungars subsided, a few elements of the Kyrgyz population returned to some of their tribal customs. When the Quqon Khanate advanced into northern Kyrgyzstan in the eighteenth century, various northern Kyrgyz tribes remained aloof from the official Islamic practices of that regime. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the entire Kyrgyz population, including the tribes in the north, had converted to Sunni Islam. Each of the Muslim ethnic groups has a deep and long tradition of customary law. 
The ethnic Kyrgyz have also preserved pre-Islamic traditions and customs which are not contrary to the Islamic teachings, which is similar to what happened in Indonesia.

==Tribal influence==

Before Islam, the religion of the Kyrgyz people was Tengriism, the recognition of spiritual kinship with a particular type of animal and reverence for the Spirits of nature, ancestors, the earth and sky. Under this belief system, which predates their contact with Islam, Kyrgyz tribes traditionally adopted reindeer, camels, snakes, owls, and bears as objects of worship. The sky, earth, sun, moon, and stars also play an important religious role. The strong dependence of the nomads on the forces of nature reinforced such connections and fostered belief in shamanism. Traces of such beliefs remain in the religious practice of many of today&#x27;s Kyrgyz residing in the north. Kyrgyz sociologist Rakhat Achylova discussed how aspects of Tengrism were adopted into Kyrgyz Islam.

Knowledge of and interest in Islam is much stronger in the south than further north. Religious practice in the north is more mixed with animism and shamanist practices, giving worship there a resemblance to Siberian religious practice.

==Islam and the state==

While religion has not played a particularly significant role in the politics of Kyrgyzstan, more traditional elements of Islamic values have been urged despite the nation&#x27;s constitution stipulating to secularism. Although the constitution forbids the intrusion of any ideology or religion in the conduct of state business, a growing number of public figures have expressed support for the promotion of Islamic traditions. As in other parts of Central Asia, non-Central Asians have been concerned about the potential of a fundamentalist Islamic revolution that would emulate Iran and Afghanistan by bringing Islam directly into the shaping of state policy, to the detriment of the non-Islamic population.

Because of sensitivity about the economic consequences of a continued outflow of Russians (brain drain), then president Askar Akayev took particular pains to reassure the non-Kyrgyz that no Islamic revolution would occur. Akayev paid public visits to Bishkek&#x27;s main Russian Orthodox church and directed one million rubles from the state treasury toward that faith&#x27;s church-building fund. He also appropriated funds and other support for a German cultural center. Nevertheless, there has been support from local government to build bigger mosques and religious schools. Additionally, recent bills have been proposed to outlaw abortion, and numerous attempts have been made to decriminalize polygamy and to allow officials to travel to Mecca on a hajj under a tax-free agreement. In August 2016, the former President of Kyrgyzstan, Almazbek Atambayev, claimed that &quot;women can become radicalised to become terrorists if they put on Islamic dress.” His remarks followed several weeks of controversy over government-sponsored hoardings or banners put up in the streets of the capital Bishkek to try to dissuade Kyrgyz women from wearing Islamic clothing, notably the hijab, niqab and burka.

==Current status==
The state recognizes two Muslim feast days as official holidays: Eid ul-Fitr (&quot;Öröz Ayt&quot;), which ends Ramadan, and Eid ul-Adha (&quot;Kurban Ayt&quot;), which commemorates Ibrahim&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his son. The country also recognizes Orthodox Christmas as well as the traditional Persian festival of Nowruz.

<text>The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, or PNSN, collects and studies ground motions from about 400 seismometers in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. PNSN monitors volcanic and tectonic activity, gives advice and information to the public and policy makers, and works to mitigate earthquake hazard.

== Motivation ==
Damaging earthquakes are well known in the Pacific Northwest, including several larger than magnitude 7, most notably the M9 1700 Cascadia earthquake and the M7.0–7.3 earthquake in about 900AD on the Seattle Fault. The M6.5 1965 Puget Sound earthquake shook the Seattle, Washington, area, causing substantial damage and seven deaths. This event spurred the installation of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network in 1969 to monitor regional earthquake activity. Early in 1980 PNSN scientists detected unrest under Mt. St. Helens and by March 1980 predicted an eruption was likely to occur &quot;soon&quot;. On March 27 the first steam and ash explosion occurred. The PNSN expanded to better monitor Mt. St. Helens and other Cascade Volcanos leading up to the deadly May 18 eruption and in the years following.

== Observations and efficacy ==
Earthquakes are recorded frequently beneath Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Hood. After successfully using seismic activity to predict the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption, monitoring was expanded to other Cascade Mountains volcanoes. The PNSN, in conjunction with the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS, now monitors seismicity at all the Cascade volcanoes in Washington and Oregon.

The network was significantly expanded after the damaging 2001 Nisqually earthquake. After an earthquake on January 30, 2009, the network&#x27;s emergency notification system failed. A magnitude 4.3 earthquake in February 2015 showed that the present architecture of the network results in a significant delay in the early warning notification program, depending upon the location of the quake, leading to proposals to again expand the network. The early warning notification program was implemented with its reliability contingent upon unknown future funding, but with the election of Donald Trump &quot;future funding is uncertain&quot; according to Washington Congressman Derek Kilmer.
The president&#x27;s budget for the fiscal year commencing October 1, 2018, calls for reductions in funding and staff for the early warning notification program.
== Operations and data archiving ==
The network operates from the Earth and Space Sciences Department at the University of Washington in Seattle, and its data archiving is at the Data Management Center of the IRIS Consortium in Seattle. The network is also affiliated with the University of Oregon Department of Geology. It is the second largest of the regional seismic networks in the ANSS (Advanced National Seismic System) and has produced more data than the networks in the states of Alaska, Utah, Nevada, Hawaii and the New Madrid, Missouri-Tennessee-Kentucky-Arkansas area.

The network is funded primarily by the United States Geological Survey, which stations its own staff on the campus, and the network is managed by UW staff. Additional funding is provided by the Department of Energy, the State of Washington, and the State of Oregon.

<doc id="1186406" wikidata="Q242956" url="?curid=1186406" title="Rita Mae Brown">
<text>Rita Mae Brown (born November 28, 1944) is an American feminist writer, best known for her coming-of-age autobiographical novel, &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot;. Brown was active in a number of civil rights campaigns and criticized the marginalization of lesbians within feminist groups. Brown received the Pioneer Award for lifetime achievement at the Lambda Literary Awards in 2015.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Brown was born in 1944 in Hanover, Pennsylvania, to an unmarried teenage mother and her mother&#x27;s married boyfriend. Brown&#x27;s birth mother left her at an orphanage. Her mother&#x27;s cousin, Julia Brown, and her husband, Ralph, retrieved the newborn Brown from the orphanage, and raised her as their own in York, Pennsylvania, and later in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Julia and Ralph Brown were active Republicans in their local party.

===Education===
Starting in late 1962, Brown attended the University of Florida on a scholarship. In the spring of 1964, the administrators of the racially segregated university expelled her for participating in the civil rights movement. She subsequently enrolled at Broward Community College with the hope of transferring eventually to a more tolerant four-year institution.

===Early career===
Brown hitchhiked to New York City and lived there between 1964 and 1969, sometimes homeless, while attending New York University, where she received a degree in classics and English. In 1968, she received a certificate in cinematography from the New York School of Visual Arts.

Brown received a Ph.D. in literature from Union Institute &amp; University in 1976 and holds a doctorate in political science.

Brown wrote for &quot;Rat&quot;, an alternative bi-weekly that eventually became New York City&#x27;s first women&#x27;s liberation newspaper. She also contributed to &quot;Come Out!&quot;, the gay liberation newspaper in NYC, published by the Gay Liberation Front.

===Later career===
In 1982, Brown wrote a screenplay parodying the slasher genre titled &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;; retitled &quot;The Slumber Party Massacre&quot;, the producers decided to play it seriously, and it was given a limited release theatrically. Brown is featured in the feminist history film &quot;She&#x27;s Beautiful When She&#x27;s Angry&quot;.

==Philosophical and political views==
In the spring of 1964, during her study at the University of Florida in Gainesville, she became active in the American Civil Rights Movement. Later in the 1960s, she participated in the anti-war movement, the feminist movement and the Lesbian Liberation movement. She was involved with the Student Homophile League at Columbia University in 1967 but left it because the men in the league were not interested in women&#x27;s rights.

She was involved in the Redstockings, but also left the group because of its lack of involvement in lesbian rights. She then went on to join the Gay Liberation Front, where she suggested the formation of an all-lesbian group, since many of the women felt excluded from the feminist movement and the male-led gay liberation movement.

Brown took an administrative position with the fledgling National Organization for Women, but resigned in January 1970 over comments by Betty Friedan seen by some as anti-lesbian and by the NOW&#x27;s attempts to distance itself from lesbian organizations. Brown claimed that &quot;lesbian&quot; was &quot;the one word that can cause the Executive Committee [of NOW] a collective heart attack.&quot;

Brown played a leading role in the &quot;Lavender Menace&quot; zap of the Second Congress to Unite Women on May 1, 1970, which protested Friedan&#x27;s remarks and the exclusion of lesbians from the women&#x27;s movement. Brown and other lesbians from the Gay Liberation Front created The Woman-Identified Woman, which was distributed at the zap. The group that wrote the manifesto then went on to become the &quot;Radicalesbians&quot;.

While doing work for the American Civil Rights Movement, Brown was introduced to consciousness-raising groups, which she incorporated into the organizations she created and the ones she worked in.

In the early 1970s, she became a founding member of The Furies Collective, a separatist lesbian feminist collective in Washington, DC that held that heterosexuality was the root of all oppression. The women wanted to create a communal living situation for radical feminists. The group purchased two houses, where they lived together and used consciousness raising techniques to talk about things like homophobia, feminism, and child rearing. They believed that being a lesbian was a political act, not just a personal one. Brown was exiled from The Furies after a few months and the group dismantled in 1972, a year after its inception.

When asked if she had ever really come out, she told &quot;Time&quot; in 2008, I don&#x27;t believe in straight or gay. I really don&#x27;t. I think we&#x27;re all degrees of bisexual. There may be a few people on the extreme if it&#x27;s a bell curve who really truly are gay or really truly are straight. Because nobody had ever said these things and used their real name, I suddenly became the only lesbian in America. It was hysterical. It was a misnomer, but it&#x27;s okay. It was a fight worth fighting. Brown also does not consider herself a &quot;lesbian writer&quot; because she believes art is about connection and not about divisive labels. In a 2015 interview for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Brown was asked if she thought awards in gay and lesbian literature were important; she replied: I love language, I love literature, I love history, and I&#x27;m not even remotely interested in being gay. I find that one of those completely useless and confining categories. Those are definitions from our oppressors, if you will. I would use them warily. I would certainly not define myself — ever — in the terms of my oppressor. If you accept these terms, you&#x27;re now lumped in a group. Now, you may need to be lumped in a group politically in order to fight that oppression; I understand that, but I don&#x27;t accept it.

==Honors, decorations, awards and distinctions==
Brown received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Massachusetts Arts Council to publish her novel &quot;Six of One&quot;.

In 1982, Brown was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program for &quot;I Love Liberty&quot;, and again for the ABC mini-series &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; in 1985.

She was co-winner of the 1982 Writers Guild of America Award for &quot;I Love Liberty&quot;, and the recipient of the New York Public Library&#x27;s Literary Lion award of 1987.

In 2015, Brown was presented the Pioneer Award for lifetime achievement at the 27th Lambda Literary Awards.

In addition, Brown was nominated for an Audie award, and won both AudioFile Earphones and Publishers Weekly Listen-Up awards.

Brown received an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in 1992.

==Personal life==
Starting in 1973, Brown lived in the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. In 1978, she moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where she lived briefly with American actress, author, and screenwriter Fannie Flagg, whom she had met at a Los Angeles party hosted by Marlo Thomas. They later broke up due to, according to Brown, &quot;generational differences&quot;, although Flagg and Brown are the same age.

In 1979, Brown met and fell in love with tennis champion Martina Navratilova. In 1980, they bought a horse farm in Charlottesville where they lived together until their breakup, over Navratilova&#x27;s then concern that coming out would hurt her application for U.S. citizenship. Brown still lives on the estate in Charlottesville.

<text>Raoul Hausmann (July 12, 1886 – February 1, 1971) was an Austrian artist and writer. One of the key figures in Berlin Dada, his experimental photographic collages, sound poetry, and institutional critiques would have a profound influence on the European Avant-Garde in the aftermath of World War I.

==Early biography==
Raoul Hausmann was born in Vienna but moved to Berlin with his parents at the age of 14, in 1901. His earliest art training was from his father, a professional conservator and painter. He met Johannes Baader, an eccentric architect and another future member of Dada, in 1905. At around the same time he met Elfride Schaeffer, a violinist, whom he married in 1908, a year after the birth of their daughter, Vera. That same year Hausmann enrolled at a private Art School in Berlin, where he remained until 1911.

After seeing Expressionist paintings in Herwarth Walden&#x27;s gallery Der Sturm in 1912, Hausmann started to produce Expressionist prints in Erich Heckel&#x27;s studio, and became a staff writer for Walden&#x27;s magazine, also called &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, which provided a platform for his earliest polemical writings against the art establishment. In keeping with his Expressionist colleagues, he initially welcomed the war, believing it to be a necessary cleansing of a calcified society, although being an Austrian citizen living in Germany he was spared the draft.

Hausmann met Hannah Höch in 1915, and embarked upon an extramarital affair that produced an &#x27;artistically productive but turbulent bond&#x27; that would last until 1922 when she left him. The relationship&#x27;s turmoil even reached the point where Hausmann fantasized about killing Höch. He talked down to her about her opinions on everything from politics to art, and only came to her aid when the other artists of the Dada movement tried to exclude her from their art shows. Even after defending her art and arguing for its inclusion in the &quot;First International Dada Fair&quot;, he went on to say Höch &quot;was never part of the club.&quot; Though Hausmann repeatedly told Höch that he was going to leave his wife to be with her, he never did. 

In 1916 Hausmann met two more people who would become important influences on his subsequent career; the psychoanalyst Otto Gross who believed psychoanalysis to be the preparation for revolution, and the anarchist writer Franz Jung. By now his artistic circle had come to include the writer Salomo Friedlaender, Hans Richter, Emmy Hennings and members of Die Aktion magazine, which, along with &quot;Der Sturm&quot; and the anarchist paper &quot;Die Freie Straße&quot; published numerous articles by him in this period.

&#x27;The notion of destruction as an act of creation was the point of departure for Hausmann&#x27;s Dadasophy, his theoretical contribution to Berlin Dada.&#x27;
==Berlin Dada==
When Richard Huelsenbeck, a 24-year-old medical student who was a close friend of Hugo Ball and one of the founders of Dada, returned to Berlin in 1917, Hausmann was one of a group of young disaffected artists that began to form the nucleus of Berlin Dada around him. Huelsenbeck delivered his &quot;First Dada Speech in Germany&quot;, January 22, 1918 at the fashionable art dealer IB Neumann&#x27;s gallery, Kurfürstendamm Berlin. Over the course of the next few weeks, Hausmann, Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, John Heartfield, Jung, Höch, Walter Mehring and Baader started the Club Dada. The first event staged was an evening of poetry performances and lectures against the backdrop of a retrospective of paintings by the establishment artist Lovis Corinth at the Berlin Sezession, April 12, 1918. Amongst the contributors, Huelsenbeck recited the &quot;Dada Manifesto&quot;, Grosz danced a &quot;Sincopation&quot; homaging Jazz, whilst Hausmann ended the evening by shouting his manifesto &quot;The New Material In Painting&quot; at the by-now near riotous audience;

&quot;The threat of violence hung in the air. One envisioned Corinth&#x27;s pictures torn to shreds with chair legs. But in the end it didn&#x27;t come to that. As Raoul Hausmann shouted his programmatic plans for dadaist painting into the noise of the crowd, the manager of the sezession gallery turned the lights out on him.&quot;
===Photomontage===
The call for new materials in painting bore fruit later the same year when Hausmann and Höch holidayed on the Baltic Sea. The guest room they were staying in had a generic portrait of soldiers, onto which the patron had glued photographic portrait heads of his son five times.

&quot;It was like a thunderbolt: one could – I saw it instantaneously – make pictures, assembled entirely from cut-up photographs. Back in Berlin that september, I began to realize this new vision, and I made use of photographs from the press and the cinema.&quot; Hausmann, 1958

The photomontage became the technique most associated with Berlin Dada, used extensively by Hausmann, Höch, Heartfield, Baader and Grosz, and would prove a crucial influence on Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitzky and Russian Constructivism. It should also be pointed out that Grosz, Heartfield and Baader all laid claim to having invented the technique in later memoirs, although no works have surfaced to justify these claims.

At the same time, Hausmann started to experiment with sound poems he called &quot;phonemes&quot; and &quot;poster poems&quot;, originally created by the chance lining up of letters by a printer without Hausmann&#x27;s direct intervention. Later poems used words which were reversed, chopped up and strung out, then either typed out using a full range of typographical strategies, or performed with boisterous exuberance. Schwitters&#x27; Ursonate was directly influenced by a performance of one of Hausmann&#x27;s poems, &quot;fmsbwtazdu&quot;, at an event in Prague in 1921.

===Der Dada: a new periodical===
After Hausmann contributed to the first group show, held at Isaac Neumann&#x27;s Gallery, April 1919, the first edition of &quot;Der Dada&quot; appeared in June 1919. Edited by Hausmann and Baader, after receiving permission from Tristan Tzara in Zurich to use the name, the magazine also featured significant contributions from Huelsenbeck. The periodical contained drawings, polemics, poems and satires, all typeset in a multiplicity of opposing fonts and signs.

At the beginning of 1920, Baader, the &quot;Oberdada&quot;, Hausmann, the “Dadasoph&quot;, and the &quot;Welt-Dada&quot; Huelsenbeck undertook a six-week tour of Eastern Germany and Czechoslovakia, drawing large crowds and bemused reviews. The programme included primitivist verse, simultaneous poetry recitals by Baader and Hausmann, and Hausmann&#x27;s &quot;Dada-Trot (Sixty-One Step)&quot; described as &#x27;a truly splendid send-up of the most modern exotic-erotic social dances that have befallen us like a plague...&#x27;

===The First International Dada Fair, 1920===
Organised by Grosz, Heartfield and Hausmann, the fair was to become the most famous of all Berlin Dada&#x27;s exploits, featuring almost 200 works by artists including Francis Picabia, Hans Arp, Ernst and Rudolf Schlichter, as well as key works by Grosz, Höch and Hausmann. The work &quot;Tatlin At Home&quot;, 1920, can be clearly seen in one of the publicity photos taken by a professional photographer; the exhibition, whilst financially unsuccessful, gained prominent exposure in Amsterdam, Milan, Rome and Boston. The exhibition also proved to be one of the main influences on the content and layout of &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot;, the show of degenerate art put on by the Nazis in 1937, with key slogans such as &quot;Nehmen Sie DADA Ernst&quot;, &quot;Take Dada Seriously!&quot;, appearing in both exhibitions.

===The Mechanical Head===
The most famous work by Hausmann, &quot;Mechanischer Kopf (Der Geist Unserer Zeit)&quot;, &quot;&quot;The Mechanical Head (The Spirit of Our Time)&quot;, c. 1920, is the only surviving assemblage that Hausmann produced around 1919–20. The Spirit of Our Time is a collage of some sort by Raoul Hausmann, created in 1919, that shows an abstract, mechanical representation of modern man. The work combines photomontages, newspaper clippings and texts to explore themes of technology and the human experience in post-war Germany. Constructed from a hairdresser&#x27;s wig-making dummy, the piece has various measuring devices attached including a ruler, a pocket watch mechanism, a typewriter, some camera segments and a crocodile wallet.

&quot;Der Geist Unserer Zeit – Mechanischer Kopf&quot; specifically evokes the philosopher George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). For Hegel...everything is mind. Among Hegel&#x27;s disciples and critics was Karl Marx. Hausmann&#x27;s sculpture might be seen as an aggressively Marxist reversal of Hegel: this is a head whose &quot;thoughts&quot; are materially determined by objects literally fixed to it. However, there are deeper targets in western culture that give this modern masterpiece its force. Hausmann turns inside out the notion of the head as seat of reason, an assumption that lies behind the European fascination with the portrait. He reveals a head that is penetrated and governed by brute external forces.
==After Dada==
===Friendship with Schwitters===
Huelsenbeck finished his training to become a doctor in 1920 and started to practice medicine; by the end of the year he had published the &quot;Dada Almanach&quot; and &quot;The History of Dadaism&quot;, two historical records that implied that Dada was at an end. In the aftermath, Hausmann&#x27;s friendship with Kurt Schwitters deepened, and Hausmann started to take steps toward International Modernism. In September 1921, Hausmann, Höch, Schwitters and his wife Helma undertook an &#x27;anti-dada&#x27; tour to Prague. As well as his recitals of sound poems, he also presented a manifesto describing a machine &quot;capable of converting audio and visual signals interchangeably, that he later called the Optophone&quot;. After many years of experimentation, this device was patented in London in 1935. He also took part in an exhibition of photomontages in Berlin in 1931, organised by César Domela Nieuwenhuis.

In the late 1920s, he re-invented himself as a fashionable society photographer, and lived in a ménage à trois with his wife Hedwig and Vera Broido in the fashionable district of Charlottenburg, Berlin. Hannah Höch - by now herself living with a woman, the Dutch author Til Brugman – left a sketch of Hausmann around 1931:

&quot;After I had offered to renew friendly relations and we met frequently (with Til as well). At the time he was living with Heda Mankowicz-Hausmann and Vera Broido in Kaiser-Friedrich-Straße in Charlottenburg. Elfrided Hausmann-Scheffer, Til and I went there often. But I always found it very boring. He was just acting the photographer, and the lover of Vera B, showing off terribly with what he could afford to buy now – the ésprit was all gone.&quot; Hannah Höch
In later years, Hausmann exhibited his photographs widely, concentrating on nudes, landscapes and portraits. As Nazi persecution of avant-garde artists increased, he emigrated to Ibiza, where his photos concentrated on ethnographic motifs of pre-modern Ibizan life. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1937, but was forced to flee again in 1938 after the German invasion. He moved to Paris, then Peyrat-le-Château, near Limoges, living there illegally with his Jewish wife Hedwig, in a quiet, secluded manner, until 1944 . After the Normandy landings in 1944, the pair finally moved to Limoges.

The war over, Hausmann was once again able to work openly as an artist. He resumed correspondence with Schwitters with the aim to collaborate on a poetry magazine, &quot;PIN&quot;, but Schwitter&#x27;s death in 1948 stopped the project. He published books about Dada, including the autobiographical &quot;Courier Dada&quot;, (1958). He also worked on &quot;photograms&quot;, photomontages and sound poetry, and even returned to painting in the Fifties.

===Revival of interest in Dada===
In the 1950s there was a revival of interest in Dada, especially in America. As interest grew, Hausmann began corresponding with a number of leading American artists, discussing Dada and its contemporary relevance. He refuted the term &quot;Neo-Dada&quot;, currently in vogue, which had been applied to a number of artists including Yves Klein and the Nouveau Réalistes, Robert Rauschenberg and Fluxus.

&#x27;His almost complete isolation was relieved only by extensive and partly conflict-ridden correspondence with old friends from the Dada movement as well as young writers and artists such as Jasper Johns, Wolf Vostell and Daniel Spoerri.&#x27;

He wrote to George Maciunas, who had included his work in the early &quot;Fluxfests&quot;, in 1962:

&quot;I think even the Americans should not use the term &quot;neodadaism&quot; because &quot;neo&quot; means nothing and &quot;ism&quot; is old-fashioned. Why not simply &quot;Fluxus&quot;? It seems to me much better, because it&#x27;s new, and dada is historic. I was in correspondence with Tzara, Hulsenbeck and Hans Richter concerning this question, and they all declare &quot;neodadaism does not exist&quot;... So long.&quot;
He died on February 1, 1971, in Limoges. His last work, the book, &quot;Am Anfang war Dada&quot;, was published posthumously in 1972.

==Scientific interests and technical work==
In addition to his work as an artist, Hausmann was interested in science and technology throughout his career, especially emerging fields like television and sound film, and Einstein&#x27;s work on relativity (which Hausmann rejected). In 1929, he received a patent for a &quot;device for monitoring body cavities and tubes,&quot; which today we would call an endoscope (patent number DRP473166). While researching light and electronics for his artworks, Hausmann collaborated with a Russian engineer Daniel Broido to design a computer that used similar technology. The device was granted a patent by the British patent office in 1934 (patent number GB446338).

== Documentary and Artistic Estate ==

=== Berlinische Galerie ===
In addition to the documentary partial estate, the collection of the Berlinische Galerie in Berlin (Germany) also includes works of art by Hausmann. In addition to early paintings, these include around 60 works on paper from the years 1911 to 1930 as well as over 350 photographic works.

The documentary part of the estate was acquired by the museum in 1992 and focuses on evidence of Raoul Hausmann&#x27;s life and activities in Berlin up to his emigration in 1933, as well as correspondence with his wife Elfriede and his daughter Vera Hausmann up to Raoul Hausmann&#x27;s death.

In addition to biographical documents, the partial estate consists largely of correspondence. These document, among other things, Hausmann&#x27;s intellectual exchange with contemporaries, including Johannes Baader, Adolf Behne, César Domela-Nieuwenhuis, Otto Freundlich, Werner Gräff, Franz Jung, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, László Moholy-Nagy, Hans Richter, Franz Roh, Kurt Schwitters, Arthur Segal and Franz Wilhelm Seifert. Typewritten business correspondence has been preserved as carbon copies and reply letters.

In addition, manuscripts and texts by Hausmann (and third parties) on art, culture and philosophy, as well as technical and scientific studies, have survived in the partial estate.

The focus of the literary texts is the novel manuscript Hyle, whose stages of development are documented by manuscripts and typescripts.

In 2019, the Hausmann collection was expanded through a donation by the German universal artist Timm Ulrichs (*1940). The documentary collection comprises Ulrichs&#x27; correspondence with Hausmann from 1967 to 1970, enriched with drafts of Hausmann&#x27;s texts.

=== Musée d’Art Contemporain de la Haute Vienne Rochechouart ===
The Musée Départemental d&#x27;Art Contemporainfr] at Rochechouart Castle in France holds the second part of Raoul Hausmann&#x27;s documentary estate. In 1993, the museum acquired the largest part of Hausmann&#x27;s correspondence from the 1940s until his death in 1971, around 6,000 letters. In 1995, this part of the documentary estate came to the museum together with a large number of unpublished texts, including theoretical and poetic writings, typescripts and notebooks. In 1996, the purchase of more than 1,200 photographic negatives and contact sheets further supplemented the holdings at the museum in Rochechouart.

<text>Jean de Noailles, 5th [[Duke of Noailles]] (&quot;Jean Louis Paul François&quot;; 26 October 1739, Paris20 October 1824) was a French nobleman and scientist.

==Early life==
Jean-Louis-Paul-François de Noailles was the son of Catherine de Cossé-Brissac and Louis, 4th duc de Noailles, a Marshal of France in 1775. His father was a nephew of Marie Victoire de Noailles, daughter-in-law of Louis XIV of France, and his paternal grandmother, Françoise Charlotte d&#x27;Aubigné, was a niece of Madame de Maintenon.

He was in the army for a period. However, his eminence as a chemist gained him the election as a member of the Académie des sciences in 1777. He was also a Knight of Golden Fleece.

He became Duc d&#x27;Ayen in 1766 on his grandfather&#x27;s death, and Duc de Noailles on his father&#x27;s in 1793. Having emigrated in 1792, he lived in Switzerland until the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, when he took his seat as a Peer of France.

==French Revolution==
As a member of the royal military the Duke was away from his estates during much of the French Revolution and was not present for the death of his father, upon which he became the Duc de Noailles. His absence spared him being arrested along with most of his relatives on orders of Robespierre in May 1794. On 22 July that year, his 70-year-old mother (the dowager Duchess Françoise de Noailles), his wife (the Duchess Anne-Louise-Henriette), their eldest daughter Louise (the Vicomte de Noaille, by virtue of marriage to her cousin Marc Antoine de Noaille), and their second daughter, Adrienne de La Fayette, were condemned to the guillotine. All were executed except for Adrienne, who was spared at the last moment due to intervention by the future American president, James Monroe (the then U.S. Minister to France), because of her husband&#x27;s efforts for America during the American War for Independence) but only after her paternal grandmother, mother, and sister were beheaded within her sight. The Duke learned of their deaths weeks later. His family had lost many other members including two of his uncles (including Philippe de Noailles, duc de Mouchy) and numerous cousins and in-laws during the Revolution.

The Duke went into self-imposed exile in Switzerland until the Bourbon Restoration, returning to France and his ravaged estates after Napoleon and the Directory restored some order. Through the efforts of his daughter Adrienne de La Fayette, whose husband&#x27;s family also suffered greatly in the Revolution, some part of his once immense fortune was restored.

==Personal life==

On 25 February 1755, he was married to heiress Henriette-Anne-Louise d&#x27;Aguesseau, the daughter of Jean Baptiste Paulin d&#x27;Aguesseau de Fresne, Count of Compans and of Maligny, and Anne Louise Françoise du Pré, Dame of la Grange-Bleneau. It was an arranged marriage, worked out by Adrien-Maurice, 3rd duc de Noailles, as Henriette was heiress to the fortune of her paternal grandfather, Henri François d&#x27;Aguesseau, a three-time Chancellor of France. Jean and Henriette lived at the family residence in Paris, the Hôtel de Noailles on Rue Saint-Honoré, and were the parents of eight children:

* Adrien Paul Louis de Noailles (1756–1757), who died in infancy.
* Anne Jeanne Baptiste Louise de Noailles (1758–1794), who married her cousin the Louis-Marie, the Vicomte de Noailles.
* Marie-Adrienne-Françoise de Noailles (Nov. 2,1759–1807), who married Gilbert Du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.
* A daughter (born and died 11 December 1760), who died upon birth.
* Françoise Antoinette Louise de Noailles (1763–1788), who became the Comtesse de Thezan du Pourjol.
* Anne Paule Dominique de Noailles (June 22, 1766 – 1839), who became the Marquise de Pouzols, Marquise de Montagu.
* Angélique Françoise d&#x27;Assise Rosalie de Noailles (1767–1833), who became the Marquise de Grammont.
* Louis Gabriel de Noailles (1768–1770), who died in infancy.

Although the Duke remarried in 1796 to the Baroness Wilhelmine Justine of Mosheim (Yury Golovkin&#x27;s mother), he had no further children and was survived by only two of his eight children. Having no surviving sons and having survived his nephews, he was succeeded as duc de Noailles by his then 22 year old grandnephew, Paul de Noailles.

<doc id="1186411" wikidata="Q2096828" url="?curid=1186411" title="Pirongia">
<text>Pirongia is a small town in the Waipa District of the Waikato region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is 12 kilometres to the west of Te Awamutu, on the banks of the Waipā River, close to the foot of the 962 metre Mount Pirongia, which lies in Pirongia Forest Park to the west of the town.

Pirongia was originally named Alexandra, after the English Princess of Wales, but to avoid confusion with the town of that name in the South Island the name was changed to Pirongia. Some of the village&#x27;s businesses and organisations such as the Alexandra Hotel and the Alexandra Racing Club retain the earlier name. Alexandra Racing Club, established in 1866, is reputed to be the second oldest racing club in New Zealand.
==History==
===Early history===

At the northern end of the town, between the Waipā River and the Mangapiko Stream, is the site of Mātakitaki pā. This was the location of a Māori battle in May 1822 between invading musket-armed Ngāpuhi led by Hongi Hika and defending Waikato led by Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, during the musket wars.

Pirongia was sited where it is because of its proximity to the Aukati (the confiscation line along the Puniu River) and because in those days this was as far up the Waipā River that river steamers, supplying the new frontier settlements, could safely travel. As a result, Pirongia (Alexandra) was planned to be the hub servicing several redoubt settlements in the area. A large settlement was envisaged and 800 town sections were surveyed. Initially, there were two military redoubts here on the east and west sides of the river. Later a third Armed Constabulary Redoubt was constructed to replace the other two. The Armed Constabulary redoubt site can be viewed on Bellot Street and the site of the military redoubt is on Aubin Close. The AC Redoubt is well preserved and is protected by the Historic Places Trust.

===19th century===

Pirongia remained of strategic importance until 1881 when King Tāwhiao and his followers symbolically laid down their arms near the intersection of Crozier and Franklin Streets and declared peace, signaling an end to the armed conflict.

Initially, the settlement prospered. In its heyday of the mid-1870s, there were two hotels, a variety of shops, a bank, a blacksmith, a lending library, a school and later a creamery, mainly on Crozier and Franklin Streets.

However, the decision to route the main trunk railway via Te Awamutu, and the resulting gradual decline in the importance of river transport, together with the dispersal from the King Country of King Tāwhiao and his followers, meant that by the 1890s, Pirongia (Alexandra) was being superseded by Te Awamutu and other settlements on the railway line. One solution which was surveyed was a light railway, but an election in 1923 saw the scheme dropped. Many businesses moved to Te Awamutu or closed and the settlement gradually assumed the character of a small farming centre.

===Modern history===

The village has experienced rapid population growth since the 1980s as city-dwellers seeking a rural lifestyle have migrated to Pirongia. This has changed the town&#x27;s character from rural to suburban in a short period of time.

Pirongia has a rural fire force located in the village to protect native bush in the area. The rural fire force has a specialised off-road appliance designed for tough off-road terrain.

Pirongia Rugby Club has strong teams in the Waikato competition.

Pirongia is also home to Pirongia Clydesdale horses regularly seen at public events throughout the countryside.

The Pirongia Heritage and Information Centre (Te Whare Taonga O Ngaa Rohe o Arekahana) has displays and items of historical interest and is located on Franklin Street in the centre of the village.

The local Pūrekireki Marae is a meeting place for the Ngāti Maniapoto hapū of Apakura and Hikairo, and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Apakura. It includes the Marutehiakina meeting house.

<text>The London and Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR) was a railway company in England which was incorporated in 1837 and survived until 1846. Its railway ran from a junction with the London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR) at Norwood – which gives it access from London Bridge, just south of the River Thames in central London. It ran from Norwood to the South Coast at Brighton, together with a branch to Shoreham-by-Sea.

==Background==
During the English Regency, and particularly after the Napoleonic Wars, Brighton rapidly became a fashionable social resort, with more than 100,000 passengers being carried there each year by coach.

===Early schemes===
A proposal by William James in 1823 to connect London &quot;with the ports of Shoreham (Brighton), Rochester (Chatham) and Portsmouth by a line of Engine Railroad&quot; was largely ignored. However, about 1825 a company called The Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Wilts &amp; Somerset Railway employed John Rennie to survey a route to Brighton, but again the proposal came to nothing.

In 1829 Rennie was commissioned to survey two possible railway routes to Brighton. The first of these, via Dorking and Horsham and Shoreham was undertaken for him by Charles Blacker Vignoles, the other more direct route, via Croydon Redhill and Haywards Heath, was by Rennie himself. This latter route would have started at Kennington Park. However both of these schemes were abandoned due to lack of support in Parliament.

These schemes were revived in 1835, which generated further proposals so that by 1836 there were six possible routes under consideration. These were:

:* Rennie&#x27;s direct route via Redhill and Haywards Heath but amended to make use of the London and Croydon Railway from London Bridge
:* Henry Robinson Palmer&#x27;s via Woldingham, Oxted and Lindfield (with a proposed link to Dover).
:* Joseph Gibbs&#x27;s from London Bridge via Croydon.
:* Nicholas Wilcox Cundy&#x27;s from Nine Elms, via Mitcham, Leatherhead, Dorking, Horsham and Shoreham.
:* Charles Vignoles&#x27; from Elephant and Castle via Croydon, Merstham and Horsham.
:* Robert Stephenson&#x27;s from the London and Southampton Railway at Wimbledon, then via Epsom, Mickleham, Dorking, Horsham and Shoreham.

Eventually it became a battle between the supporters of Rennie&#x27;s direct route (which was the most difficult and expensive to build), and Stephenson&#x27;s (which was longer but involved less civil engineering work). After prolonged campaigns by the supporters of the different proposals, a bill for Stephenson&#x27;s route was approved by the House of Commons in 1836, but was later rejected by the House of Lords. A parliamentary committee of enquiry was established to consider the merits of all four schemes. The chairman of the committee moved that an Ordnance engineer should be appointed to survey all four routes. The proposal was agreed and a Captain Robert Alderson R.E. was engaged to do the work. He recommended the adoption of the Rennie direct route after Redhill. However, members of the Committee insisted that a stretch of the new route between Croydon and Redhill should be shared with the South Eastern Railway as part of its projected route to Dover, which had not been part of Rennie&#x27;s plan.
The final agreed route therefore consisted of a new line from a junction with the London and Croydon Railway (then under construction) at Norwood to Brighton with additional branches to Lewes and Shoreham. An act of Parliament, the (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. cxix) for the construction of the line was passed in July 1837, with an authorised capital of £2.4 million. The new company was also permitted to buy the track of the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Iron Railway. The expenditure associated with the parliamentary contest in choosing the route was estimated to be more than £193,000.

==Construction==
The London and Croydon Railway line ran from London Bridge to West Croydon and was opened in 1839.
The engineer for the Brighton extension was John Urpeth Rastrick, who began construction of the line in 1838. By July 1840, 6,206 men, 962 horses, five locomotives and seven stationary engines were employed.

The new main line included substantial earthworks and five tunnels through the North Downs at Merstham, the Wealden ridge near Balcombe and at Haywards Heath, and the South Downs at Patcham and Clayton. The railway also had a long, high viaduct over the River Ouse near Balcombe.

The Brighton - Shoreham branch was completed in May 1840, before the main line, as, aside from the deep cutting and short Belmont Tunnel and the embankment between Portslade and Southwick, there were no significant civil engineering works on this section. Locomotives and rolling stock had to be transshipped by road for what was, in the first year, an isolated stretch of railway. After the formation of the LBSCR the branch was successively extended to Portsmouth, becoming the Brighton to Portsmouth line.

The main line was opened in two sections, since major earthworks delayed completion in one piece. The Norwood Junction – Haywards Heath section was opened on 12 July 1841 and the remainder of the line from Haywards Heath to Brighton on 21 September 1841.

The branch line to Lewes authorised by the London and Brighton Railway Act 1837 was built 1844–46 by a separate company, the Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway.

===Architecture===

The railway employed the architect David Mocatta, who designed a number of attractive yet practical Italianate style stations using standardised modules. These were London Bridge, Croydon, Godstone Road, Red Hill and Reigate Road, Horley, Crawley, Haywards Heath, Hassocks Gate and Brighton. Only Mocatta&#x27;s station at Brighton is still standing (which also incorporated the railway offices), but his building is now largely obscured by later additions. Mocatta also designed the eight stone and brick pavilions and a stone balustrade which embellish Rastrick&#x27;s brick viaduct over the River Ouse.

The L&amp;BR built fully equipped locomotive depots and workshops at Brighton in 1840 and Horley in 1841. Horley was originally intended to serve as the principal workshop of the railway, but John Chester Craven decided in 1847 to develop Brighton railway works instead.

==Locomotives==
The L&amp;BR acquired 34 steam locomotives between January 1839 and March 1843, the first two of which were a 2-2-2 and an 0-4-2 supplied by Jones, Turner and Evans and used by the contractors constructing the line. The remainder were mainly 2-2-2 consisting of 16 supplied by Sharp, Roberts and Company, six by Edward Bury and Company, four by William Fairbairn, and three by G. and J. Rennie. The last three locomotives were 2-4-0 supplied by George Forrester and Company between October 1842 and March 1843. 
Initially these locomotives were the responsibility of the civil engineer and his assistant, but this arrangement was ended after an unfavourable report on their safety in 1843. From 1842 the L&amp;CR had pooled its locomotive stock with the South Eastern Railway(SER), to form the &#x27;Croydon and Dover Joint Committee&#x27;. From March 1844 the L&amp;BR joined the scheme and their locomotives were operated by the Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee, which also ordered further locomotives. These pooling arrangements had the advantage of providing the L&amp;BR with access to the South Eastern Railway repair facilities, at New Cross but caused great operating problems. In March 1845 John Gray was appointed as Locomotive Superintendent of the L&amp;BR and in April the company gave notice of withdrawal from the arrangement from January 1846, when the pooled locomotives were divided between the companies.

Following the dispersal of the pool in March 1845, the L&amp;BR acquired 44 locomotives, some of which it had previously owned, and the remainder from the
SER, L&amp;CR, or else those purchased by the Joint Committee.

==Amalgamation==
On 27 July 1846, the L&amp;B amalgamated with the L&amp;C, the Brighton and Chichester Railway and the Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. The amalgamation had been brought about by shareholders in the L&amp;CR and L&amp;BR who were dissatisfied with the early returns from their investment.

<doc id="1186415" wikidata="Q662706" url="?curid=1186415" title="David Cohen (politician)">
<text>David Cohen (November 13, 1914 – October 3, 2005) was an American lawyer, Democratic civil servant and politician. For the last 26 years of his life, he was a Philadelphia city councilman representing the northwest district. Having served a four-year term not consecutive to the other terms, he represented northwest Philadelphia for a total of 29 years. He died in office aged 90.

Cohen was a local Democratic and community leader during the mayoral administrations of Philadelphia Mayors Joseph S. Clark Jr. and Richardson Dilworth, a councilman during the administration of Mayor James Tate and the police commissionership of Mayor Frank Rizzo, and a councilman in the mayoral administrations of Mayors William J. Green III, Wilson Goode, Ed Rendell, and John F. Street. He served nearly 14 full years in City Council with future mayor Michael Nutter (who was elected mayor two years after Cohen&#x27;s death). His views on city issues were often at odds with the majority in city government. Rendell described him as the most tenacious political leader he ever met.

Cohen supported labor unions, collective bargaining, racial integration, desegregation, and equal opportunity since the late 1930s. He claimed he had anticipated trends of increasing support for such positions. He campaigned with planks of civil rights, workers rights, good government, constituent service and geographic inclusiveness.

In his first term on the City Council, he successfully sponsored in 1970 an air pollution measure, and emphasized it in his next campaign. His chemical right-to-know bill, in 1982, was one of the nation&#x27;s first. He opposed waste incineration within the city, successfully in the case of a proposed plant near the Philadelphia Naval Yard. During his tenure, two long existing waste facilities were shut down. He claimed that these curtailments in waste facility operations produced a saving of $1.5 billion in trash disposal costs over thirty years and enhanced the attractiveness of the city areas of South Philadelphia, Northern Liberties, and Roxborough as targets for development.

In 1995, Cohen declared himself &quot;a Franklin D. Roosevelt Democrat&quot;, and thereafter refused any other public comment on supporting political alliances in the city.

At his death in 2005 at age 90, Cohen was one of the oldest American elected leaders in office, serving at large on the City Council.

==Early political career==
Cohen, a child of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, was born in south Philadelphia. 
Cohen first became active in politics as a campaign worker for Democratic mayoral nominee John B. Kelly Sr. in 1935. He was appointed an attorney for the Rural Electrification Administration in Washington, D.C., in 1938 after graduating first in his class from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1937 and winning a graduate fellowship. As a graduate fellow, Cohen did research used for upholding the constitutionality of Pennsylvania&#x27;s law providing for a minimum wage equal to the federal minimum wage for some people not covered by the federal minimum wage.
As a Rural Electrification Administration attorney, Cohen drafted state laws for various states and became president of the agency union and participated in negotiations with two Secretaries of Agriculture.

Cohen resigned his position with the federal government in 1943, then located in St. Louis, Missouri, as the federal government dispersed federal agencies around the country to forestall an enemy attack on them in World War II, to prepare to enter the U.S. Army. Briefly working for the St. Louis Congress of Industrial Organizations while awaiting the completion of enlistment processing, Cohen made the transition from volunteer union leader to union staffer.

His first job after returning from New Guinea in the South Pacific theater, where he had reached the rank of the rank of staff sergeant, the highest rank for a non-commissioned officer, after declining to attend Officer Candidate School, was to legally represent federal union employees in New York City, where his wife&#x27;s family lived, and help them unionize. In one case, after independent journalist I. F. Stone interviewed him, he recruited Stone as a volunteer legal aide so that Stone could get a first hand view of the obstacles facing union workers.

After an unsuccessful run for Judge of Elections in 1953, Cohen was elected a Democratic committeeman in his division in 1954. He later became Treasurer of the 49th Ward Democratic Executive Committee, President of the Northwest Philadelphia Chapter of the American Jewish Congress, and head of the Northwest Philadelphia Chapter of the Community Chest. He also was active in the Jewish War Veterans, and often cited his experiences dealing with soldiers from rural areas in Missouri, running a health care clinic for soldiers in New Guinea and giving them legal advice as formative ones.

He spent the end of 1964 gathering information about violations of African-American voting rights in Mississippi in support of the challenge to the seating in Congress of Mississippi&#x27;s Congressional delegation.

Following the one man, one vote decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the wards of Philadelphia were redistricted, and the 49th Ward was split in half. Cohen was elected Democratic leader of the 17th Ward in 1966, and was continuously reelected henceforth. In 2002, he became the most senior Democratic ward leader in the City of Philadelphia, and he continued to serve as the 17th Ward Democratic leader until his death. 

==City council==
City Council redistricting left Northwest Philadelphia without an incumbent councilman, and Cohen was elected to that position in 1967, quintupling the November victory margin of the previous incumbent. 

Sworn in as a member of City Council in 1968, Cohen became a leader of the independent factions of the City Council, and worked to focus the City Council on previously slighted problems dealing with zoning, public health care, air pollution, governmental ethics, delivery of city services, and race relations. Elected a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Cohen supported the Presidential campaigns of Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy, and frequently spoke at rallies opposing the War in Vietnam.

Cohen resigned to run for Mayor of Philadelphia in 1971. After failing to garner adequate support to win the Democratic mayoral nomination, he withdrew and supported Congressman William J. Green III, who lost to former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo. 

Cohen remained active in Philadelphia politics and civic life, campaigning for George McGovern, running unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for City Controller in 1973 and for Councilman at large in 1975. He joined an unsuccessful effort to recall Mayor Rizzo in 1976 after Rizzo, who had won two elections opposing tax increases, pushed through the largest tax increase in Philadelphia history. Cohen was one of the leaders of the successful opposition to Mayor Rizzo&#x27;s campaign to amend the City Charter in order to allow Rizzo to seek a third consecutive term as mayor.

He returned to the Philadelphia City Council in 1980, this time as a Councilman at Large. He began his tenure by working to make the rules of City Council more effective and democratic. When City Council President George X. Schwartz, Council Majority Leader Harry Jannotti, and Councilman Louis Johanson were taped accepting bribes from FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks in the nationally prominent Abscam scandals, he and freshman councilman John F. Street, who later became Mayor of Philadelphia, began regularly demanding explanations and resignations from the implicated City Council members. When Schwartz resigned as City Council President in the fall of 1980, Cohen backed his successor as District Councilman in the 8th Councilmanic District, Joseph E. Coleman, whom Cohen had defeated in 1967 for the Democratic nomination, as Council President. Coleman, the first African-American to serve as Council President, later appointed Cohen as Chairman of City Council&#x27;s Rules Committee.

Cohen&#x27;s 25 years as at large councilman were the longest tenure in that position since it was created by City Charter amendment in 1951. Throughout it, Cohen was an independent voice in City Council, actively examining and often seeking to modify or defeat the proposals of Mayors William J. Green III, Wilson Goode, Ed Rendell, and John F. Street.

== Advanced years ==
Celebrating his 90th birthday as a member of City Council on November 13, 2004, Cohen told &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; he would not retire from City Council and would run for reelection in 2007.

Over 500 people attended a &quot;Tribute to Change&quot; reception at the University of Pennsylvania, held to raise money to fund Bread and Roses, a Philadelphia charitable foundation, and to honor him and his wife Florence Cohen for their lifetimes of activism, on September 12, 2005. The event, held near the law school where he had graduated first in his class more than 68 years earlier, turned out to be his last public appearance before his death.

==Personal background==
In 1946, Cohen married Florence Herzog, whom he had met when she too worked for the Rural Electrification Administration. Together they had four children. His wife headed a community organization, the Ogontz Area Neighbors Association, and two political organizations, the 17th Ward Democratic Women&#x27;s Club and the New Democratic Coalition of Philadelphia. From January 1980 until her retirement in September 1996, she served as his City Council Chief of Staff.

His son Denis P. Cohen served for 24 years as an assistant district attorney, and was a leader of the Philadelphia Bar Association. His son Mark B. Cohen is a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia. He was sworn in on January 2, 2018. His daughter Sherrie Cohen was a trial lawyer in Florida and Philadelphia, as well as an activist for public, political, and gay causes. His daughter Judy Cohen Minches was a reporter in New Jersey, a leader in her synagogue, and a mother of three.

==Death==
David Cohen died on October 3, 2005, at the age of 90, after a hospitalization at Albert Einstein Medical Center, a few blocks from his home of 53 years. The cause of death was heart failure, although he had entered the hospital for kidney failure. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; columnist Claude Lewis, a longtime observer of Philadelphia politics, metaphorically suggested in an October 5, 2005 column that he had died of heart failure because &quot;he used his heart so much.&quot;

He was buried in Har Nebo Cemetery in the Oxford Circle section of Philadelphia. His grave is located at the intersection of Israel and Shalom streets near entrance number 2. On his gravestone, unveiled on October 22, 2006, are the words &quot;conscience of the city.&quot;

<doc id="1186416" wikidata="Q3704837" url="?curid=1186416" title="SpinRite">
<text>SpinRite is a computer program for scanning RAS Random Access Storage devices such as hard disks, reading and rewriting data to resolve and retrieve data that is unreadable by DOS or Windows. The first version was released in 1987 by Steve Gibson. The current version, 6.1, was released in 2024. 

SpinRite is run from a bootable medium (such as a CD, DVD or USB flash drive) on a PC-compatible computer, allowing it to scan a computer&#x27;s storage medium. It does not depend on the operating system installed on the computer.

== History ==
SpinRite was originally written as a hard drive interleave tool. At the time SpinRite was designed, hard drives often had a defect list printed on the nameplate, listing known bad sectors discovered at the factory. In changing the drive&#x27;s interleave, SpinRite needed to be able to remap these physical defects into different logical sectors. SpinRite therefore gained its data recovery and testing capabilities as a side-effect of its original purpose. Drive interleave has long ceased to be an issue, but SpinRite continued to be developed, now using its remapping as a data recovery tool.

== Features ==
SpinRite tests the data surfaces of writeable magnetic disks, including IDE, SATA, and floppy disks, plus SSD Solid State Drives. It analyzes their contents and can refresh the magnetic disk surfaces or flash memory storage to allow them to operate more reliably.

SpinRite attempts to recover data from drives that the operating system cannot read. When the program encounters errors reading data, it tries to read the sector up to 2,000 times, in order to determine, by comparing the successive results, the most probable value of each bit. The data is then saved to the original location or to a location on the same disk; it does not save data elsewhere. In this respect, SpinRite differs from most data recovery software, which usually provides (and recommends) an option to save the recovered data onto another disk, or onto a separate partition on the same disk.

Gibson says he designed SpinRite to fix sector problems, not failures of circuit boards, motors, or other mechanical parts. When a hard drive&#x27;s ability to read data slows or begins unreliable, SpinRite may recover data that can then be copied to another drive.

SpinRite is claimed by its developer to have certain unique features, such as disabling of disk write caching, disabling of auto-relocation, compatibility with disk compression, identification of the &quot;data-to-flux-reversal encoder-decoder&quot; used in a drive, and separate testing of buffered and unbuffered disk read performance, and direct hardware-level access, whereby the drive&#x27;s internal controller interacts directly with the program, rather than through the operating system. This, in turn, allows dynamic head repositioning, whereby, when reading a faulty sector, the reading head is deliberately moved backwards and forwards many times, by varying amounts, in the hope that each time it returns to the sector, it may come to rest in a slightly different position. By performing statistical analysis on the succession of results thus obtained, SpinRite is, according to its maker, often able to &quot;reconstruct&quot; data from damaged sectors, and even in those cases in which complete reconstruction proves impossible, SpinRite is able to extract all intact bits from a partially unreadable, and write them back, or copy them to a new block, thereby minimizing the amount of data lost.

SpinRite is written in x86 assembly language, and runs on any PC-compatible computer, regardless of the operating system installed. It can operate on any attached storage device with a compatible interface.
Drives in computers with incompatible processors can be tested by attaching the drive to a compatible computer. Spinrite is distributed as a Microsoft Windows executable program which can create a bootable drive containing both the FreeDOS MS-DOS-compatible operating system and the Spinrite program itself.
Version 6 is compatible with hard disks containing any logical volume management or file system such as FAT16 or 32, NTFS, Ext3 as well as other Linux file systems, HFS+ For Mac OS X, TiVo and others.

Version 6 offers full access to the entire disk surface regardless of partitioning, Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) parameters and control of partial scanning within a specified percentage range. Version 5 was limited to AT Attachment (PATA, IDE) hard drives; version 6 may, on suitable motherboards, work on newer Serial ATA (SATA) and USB hard drives, and with any other type of drive—SCSI, 1394/FireWire—that can be made visible to MS-DOS through the addition of controller BIOS or add-on DOS drivers.

In May 2013, Steve Gibson announced the start of work on SpinRite 6.1 and 7.

== Issues ==

=== Solid state drives ===
Spinrite can be run and can be effective on SSDs, but running in a higher-level mode than 1 or 2 is detrimental, as it wears the SSD by writing to it unnecessarily. In episode #387 of the podcast Security Now! Gibson said &quot;Run Level 2 because Level 1 is not permitted to fix anything&quot; &quot;The difference is both Level 1 and 2 are read-only, and that&#x27;s the key. You don&#x27;t want to run Level 4&quot; In episode 194 of the podcast Security Now! Gibson said that he could &quot;see absolutely no possible benefit to running SpinRite on a solid-state drive&quot; and later &quot;SpinRite is all about mechanics and magnetics, neither of which exist, by design, in an SSD&quot;. In episode 338 Gibson clarified &quot;it is actually detrimental because [solid-state drives] don&#x27;t like to be written&quot;, but also pointing out that a read-only run could be beneficial: &quot;SpinRite&#x27;s Level 1 is a read-only scan, and doing that on an SSD makes a lot of sense. Do a read-only scan of an SSD, it&#x27;ll show the SSD&#x27;s controller that it&#x27;s got a problem reading a sector, and then it&#x27;ll map that out or rewrite it in order to strengthen that sector, if possible. So that ends up being a value for SpinRite on solid-state drives.&quot; Also, Gibson responded to a question on his website, saying that &quot;SpinRite works on thumb drives and on all other solid state drives&quot;.

=== S.M.A.R.T. on SATA drives ===
While SATA drives are supported, SATA controllers that include a processor and diagnostic software can limit SpinRite&#x27;s ability to obtain and display S.M.A.R.T. data (&quot;thin controller&quot; SATA controllers do not have this limitation). This data monitor does not affect SpinRite&#x27;s recovery and diagnostics ability; S.M.A.R.T. data when available helps long-term disk maintenance and failure prediction. GRC said in 2006 that this issue would be resolved in version 6.1, anticipated to be a free-of-charge upgrade for SpinRite 6.0 users. , SpinRite version 6.0 continued to be current, unable to function with systems that utilize EFI bios, with unchanged price.

=== Large drives ===
In certain cases, Spinrite can only analyze somewhere between the first 128 gigabytes and 1024 gigabytes of a drive depending on whether the drive has 512 bytes per sector or 4096 bytes per sector, and depending on the BIOS in use.

SpinRite uses cylinder-head-sector method when addressing the hard drive. This 28-bit addressing scheme is broken down as:

# Cylinder (16-bits): 0–65535
# Head (4-bits): 0–15
# Sector (8-bits): 0–255

This limits SpinRite to access a maximum of 268,435,456 sectors. Once SpinRite reaches track number 65,535 it will experience a division-by-zero error and halt with an error message. This appears to be due to a restriction of the FreeDOS operating system (an MS-DOS clone) supplied with Spinrite. Some users have reported that Spinrite has problems with very large drives, and that using, say, MS-DOS boot disk created from Windows 95 or 98 (which refers to itself as MS-DOS version 7, which is otherwise not sold separately), Spinrite will test the entire drive without software error; other users report that this did not resolve the Division Overflow error.

A December 2011 page on the Spinrite website says that an anomaly, which was named the &quot;Roger anomaly&quot; after its discoverer, is due to an error in the BIOS of some motherboards which does not affect normal use and hence may not be discovered. A motherboard with this problem will not work with Spinrite, although it is sometimes resolved in a later BIOS update. In case of a motherboard compatibility issue, Spinrite say that drives can always be temporarily connected to another motherboard where &quot;SpinRite will almost certainly agree to operate without trouble&quot;. Drive size is not mentioned as a factor.

== Reception ==
&quot;BYTE&quot; magazine in 1989 listed SpinRite as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that while alternatives had appeared, &quot;for now, SpinRite is our pick&quot;.

== Controversy ==

Some public reviewers doubt SpinRite&#x27;s ability to &quot;refresh&quot; aging drives, and &quot;recovery&quot; of sectors marked as &quot;damaged&quot; is considered by some to be undesirable and counter-productive.

<doc id="1186417" wikidata="Q3081535" url="?curid=1186417" title="Islam in Maldives">
<text>Islam is the state religion of the Maldives. The 2008 Constitution or &quot;Fehi Gānoon&quot; declares the significance of Islamic law in the country. The constitution requires that citizenship status be based on adherence to the state religion, which legally makes the country&#x27;s citizens 100% Muslim. 

==History==

Islamic influence in the Maldives may date as far back as the 10th century, with mentions of the region by Arabic accounts dating to around the 9th and 10th centuries. The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives Dhovemi converted to Islam in the year 1153 (or 1193, for certain copper plate grants give a later date). The king thereupon adopted the Muslim title and name (in Arabic) of Sultan (besides the old Dhivehi title of &quot;Maha Radun&quot; or &quot;Ras Kilege&quot; or &quot;Rasgefānu&quot;) Muhammad al-Adil, initiating a series of six Islamic dynasties consisting of eighty-four sultans and sultanas that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the Sultan up to 1965 was, &quot;Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives&quot; which came with the style &quot;Highness&quot;. The person traditionally deemed responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, opposite the Hukuru Mosque in the capital Malé. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives.

Scholars believe that the Islamization of the Maldives was a gradual process that likely took centuries, beginning before the official conversion of king Dhovemi and ending significantly after his conversion. 

=== Introduction of Islam ===

Maghrebi/Berber theory Arab interest in the Maldives also was reflected in the residence there in the 1340s of Ibn Battutah. The well-known Moroccan traveller wrote how a Berber from North Morocco, one &quot;Abu Barakat Yusuf the Berber&quot;, was believed to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the islands, reportedly convincing the local king after having subdued Ranna Maari, a monster coming from the sea. Even though this report has been contested in later sources, it does explain some crucial aspects of Maldivian culture. For instance, historically Arabic has been the prime language of administration there, instead of the Persian and Urdu languages used in the nearby Muslim states. Another link to North Africa was the Maliki school of jurisprudence, used throughout most of North Africa, which was the official one in the Maldives until the 17th century.

==== Somali theory ====

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias or felt partial towards the North African Maghrebi/Berber narrative of this Shaykh. Instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time. Even when Ibn Battuta visited an island of the Maldives, the governor of the island at that time was Abd Aziz Al Mogadishawi, a Somali.

Also another prominent Shaykh on the island during Ibn Battuta&#x27;s stay, was Shaykh Najib al Habashi Al Salih, another learned man from the Horn of Africa. His presence Indicating a strong Horn of African Islamic presence on the Island.

Scholars have spoken that Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari might have been a resident of Berbera, a significant trading port on the north western coast of Somaliland. &quot;Barbara&quot; or &quot;Barbaroi&quot; (Berbers), as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively. This is also seen when Ibn Battuta visited Mogadishu, he mentions that the Sultan at that time &#x27;Abu Bakr ibn Shaikh Omar&#x27;, was a Berber (Somali).

==== Persian theory ====

Another interpretation, in the &quot;Raadavalhi&quot; and &quot;Taarikh&quot;, is that Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari was Abu al-Barakat Yusuf Shams ud-Din at-Tabrizi, also locally known as Tabrīzugefānu. In the Arabic script the words al-Barbari and al-Tabrizi are very much alike, since, at the time, Arabic had several consonants that looked identical and could only be differentiated by overall context (this has since changed by addition of dots above or below letters to clarify pronunciation – For example, the letter &quot;ب&quot; in modern Arabic has a dot below, whereas the letter &quot;ت&quot; looks identical except there are two dots above it). &quot;ٮوسڡ الٮٮرٮرى&quot; could be read as &quot;Yusuf at-Tabrizi&quot; or &quot;Yusuf al-Barbari&quot;.

==Islamic influence==

Islam is the state religion of Maldives, and adherence to it is legally required for citizens by a revision of the constitution in 2008: Article 9, Section D and 10 states,&quot;A non-Muslim may not become a citizen of the Maldives.&quot;

&quot;The religion of the State of the Maldives is Islam. Islam shall be the one of the basis of all the laws of the Maldives. No law contrary to any tenet of Islam shall be enacted in the Maldives.&quot;

The traditional Islamic law code of sharia forms the Maldives&#x27; basic code of law, as interpreted to conform to local Maldivian conditions by the President, the attorney general, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Majlis. Article 142 of the constitution states, &quot;When deciding matters on which the Constitution or the law is silent, Judges must consider Islamic Shari’ah.&quot;

Proselytizing by non-Muslims in Maldives, including the public possession and distribution of non-Muslim religious materials (such as the Bible), is illegal. Public worship by adherents of religions other than Islam is forbidden.

On the inhabited islands, the mosque forms the central place where Islam is practiced. Because Friday is the most important day for Muslims to attend the mosque, shops and offices in towns and villages close around 11 a.m., reopening at 1 or 2 p.m., and the sermon begins by 12:35 p.m.

The prayer call is performed by the  (Muezzin). Most shops and offices close for fifteen minutes after each call. During the ninth Muslim month of Ramadan, cafés and restaurants are closed during the day, and working hours are limited.

== Mosques ==

Most inhabited Maldivian islands have several mosques; Malé has more than thirty. Most traditional mosques are whitewashed buildings constructed of coral stone with corrugated iron or thatched roofs. In addition to regular mosques are smaller, temporary mosques which accommodate fewer worshippers. These mosques are built in less time and labour in place of other mosques and buildings and will be demolished later on.

In Malé, the Islamic Centre and the Grand Friday Mosque, built in 1984 with funding from the Persian Gulf states, Pakistan, Brunei, and Malaysia, are imposing, elegant structures. The gold-colored dome of this mosque is the first structure sighted when approaching Malé. In mid-1991 Maldives had a total of 724 mosques and 266 women&#x27;s mosques. However in recent years, mosques made especially for women have been demolished and reconstructed for other purposes. All mosques in Maldives have a separate area where the women pray. Following the Islamic holy month of Ramadan is the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, and at early morning on this day the locals gather in congregation, usually at a large open field or park, to perform the Eid Salah.

==Radicalism==

&quot;The Guardian&quot; estimates that 50-100 fighters have joined ISIS and al-Qaeda from the Maldives. The Financial Times puts the number at 200.

* 2007 Malé bombing: On 29 September 2007 a homemade bomb went off in Sultan Park near the Islamic Centre in the Maldivian capital Malé, injuring 12 foreign tourists. In December, three men were sentenced to 15 years in jail after they confessed to the bombing. Two of those imprisoned, Mohamed Sobah and Ahmed Amin - both Maldivian natives in their early twenties-had their sentences changed from incarceration to three-year suspended sentences under observation and were later set free in August 2010.
* 2011 Ismail Khilath Rasheed controversy: In February 2012 almost all the Maldives National Museum&#x27;s pre-Islamic artifacts, dating back to before the 12th century, were destroyed during an attack: &quot;Some of the pieces can be put together but mostly they are made of sandstone, coral and limestone, and they are reduced to powder.&quot; He said the museum had &quot;nothing [left] to show&quot; of the country&#x27;s pre-Islamic history. Among the damaged objects were a six-faced coral statue, an high bust of Buddha, as well as assorted limestone and coral statues

==Religious Stand of Maldives and Public Etiquette ==
In 2008 after the ratification of the new constitution, multi-party democracy was instated in the Maldives.

The Maldivian religious party named the Adhaalath Party was founded by the religious scholars and religious activists. Under the new freedom of speech and relaxed laws radicalism and different forms of religious factions rose in Maldives.

The religious extremism was controlled by the state, since in every presidency the coalition governments consisted with the Adhaalath Party&#x27;s affiliation. The Islamic Ministry and major executive portfolio is represented by the Adaalath Party. In the Maldives, general clothing guidelines are observed as per democratic law instated and extremism is punishable by lengthy jail sentences.

<doc id="1186423" wikidata="Q1950639" url="?curid=1186423" title="Mount Pirongia">
<text>Mount Pirongia is an extinct stratovolcano located in the Waikato region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It rises to and is the highest peak around the Waikato plains. Pirongia&#x27;s many peaks are basaltic cones created by successive volcanic eruptions between the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, about 2.5 million years ago. In the adjacent picture, the characteristic profile of the mountain can be seen, along with a prominent accessory cone to the right (on the northern flank).

==History==

The Māori people of the Tainui waka (Ngāti Maniapoto, Waikato Tainui, Ngāti Hikairo) have strong whakapapa-based links to Mount Pirongia. The mountain was first encountered after landfall of the Tainui waka around 800 years ago. Early names bestowed on the mountain included Paewhenua (the land barrier, given by Rakātaura) and Pukehoua (now given to a flank cone on the eastern side of the mountain). The present name is:, which translates to &#x27;the putrid stench of Kahu&#x27;, or more gently, the &#x27;scented pathway of Kahu&#x27;. This name originates from Kahupekapeka (a Tainui tupuna), who following the death of her husband Uenga (descendent of the ariki Hoturoa), left Kāwhia with her son Rākamaomao and travelled inland, naming many peaks across the Waikato region. Kahupekapeka searched the bush on Pirongia for rongoā rākau (medicinal plants) to heal her body, which was afflicted by the miscarriage of her unborn child with Uenga.

To preserve the heritage of Mount Pirongia, &quot;Pirongia Te Aroaro o Kahu Restoration Society Inc&quot; was formed in 2002 as a result of deep-seated community interest in its ecological restoration. During 2001 DoC had invited nominations for a working group. The Society evolved from a hui at Pūrekireki Marae on 20 April 2002. The Māori people have a strong connection to Mount Pirongia.

==Geography==

Mount Pirongia is located to the west of Te Awamutu and from the small settlement of Pirongia, and lies in the Pirongia Forest Park. It is clearly visible from the Tasman Sea, being just from the coast at Aotea Harbour.

===Geology===

Mount Pirongia is the largest stratovolcano in the Alexandra Volcanic Group chain which extends inland from Mount Karioi near Raglan. It is a mainly basaltic volcano, though andesite dykes form the peaks of Wharauroa, Mahaukura, Tirohanga, Pirongia Summit and The Cone. To the west it merges into the highland terrain of the Karioi horst block and in the east it arises above the Hamilton Basin, a major rift-related depression bound by the Waipa Fault Zone. There are at least six edifice-forming members separated by features including those resulting from large volume collapse events. The largest debris avalanche (the Oparau breccia) cascaded at least 25 km southwest from Pirongia into the Kawhia Harbour and was larger in volume (3.3 km3) than the Mt. St. Helens collapse of 1980 (2.5 km3). The collapse was followed by late-stage eruptions from the summit area around 1.6 Ma. The mountain contains unusually crystal-rich lavas of (ankaramite basalt) that also occur on Karioi, Kakepuku and Te Kawa but are not found elsewhere in New Zealand. 
===Land use===
Mount Pirongia is a popular place for hunters from Hamilton seeking a quick day trip hunt, holding several feral goat herds on its bush-clad slopes. Rumours abound about small numbers of red deer released by farmers after an earlier deer farming boom went bust. Pirongia Forest Park is administered by the Waikato DoC office in Hamilton.
==Ecology==

Threatened plants include king fern, carmine rātā, thismia rodwayi and Wood Rose or Dactylanthus taylorii, a rare and endangered parasitic flowering plant, found on the ridges of Mount Pirongia. Near the summit there are mountain flax, coprosmas and ferns. Botanically, Mount Pirongia is also interesting area as it marks the transition between the warmth-loving kauri forest of the north and the beech and podocarp-beech forest in the south. The park&#x27;s latitude is the naturally occurring southern limit for kauri, mangeao, mairehau, tāwari and taraire.

The canopy in the podocarp forest of the lower slopes is tawa, with scattered rimu, kohekohe and a few other trees. The subcanopy has tree ferns, including wheki and ponga, and nikau palm, with pigeonwood (porokaiwhiri), hīnau, pukatea, supplejack (kareao), māhoe, hangehange, kanono and toropapa. Rātā replaces kohekohe at higher levels, until a change to upland forest (dominated by kāmahi, tawheowheo and tāwari) at about . Above that, kāmahi, tāwari and tawheowheo become more prominent until at tawa is very rare. Above there are also scattered Hall&#x27;s totara, miro, rātā and horopito, and, near the summit, pāhautea (at its northern limit on the west coast), but no rimu. Rocky summit pinnacles have the sub alpine species snow tōtara and eyebright (Euphrasia revoluta)&quot;.&quot;

Commonly found birds are: pīwakawaka, kōtare, tūī, kererū and kārearea. In 2019 funding was won for reintroduction of kōkako.

=== Pest control ===
Possums and goats have been controlled since 1996, brown and black rats since 2006 and mustelids since 2019, using traps and goat, deer and pig hunters. About 1,000 goats were culled in 2021-22. 1080 drops in 2007, 2014 and 2020 were effective in reducing possum numbers. The &quot;Pirongia-aroaro-o-Kahu Restoration Society&quot; has a network of bait stations on the north east side of Pirongia.

=== Tracks ===
==== Summit tracks ====
There are numerous tracks to the summit. All the tracks are well signposted, with bright orange plastic waymarks and near the summit have recently been laid with boardwalks (see photo below), some of them as part of Te Araroa long distance trail. A lookout platform was built on Pirongia summit after 1999. From it, it is possible to spot Mount Taranaki summit and Mount Ruapehu summit on a clear day (see sunset photo). On the west side there are Aotea, Kawhia and Raglan harbours.

* Mahaukura - Tirohanga Circuit (8–11 hours return) (4–6 hr / one way) is a longer distance but with a gradual climb from Grey Road. This track is considered difficult. It leads through many steep sections but gives excellent views from Wharauroa lookout (), the last to it having a fixed chain to assist climbing, Mahaukura peak () and Tirohanga peak. In winter and after rain the track becomes muddy and slippery. There are many narrow sections with a tangle of tree roots and rocks.
** Wharauroa Track (2 hr / one way) is an alternative route to Wharauroa lookout, which is shorter and about less to climb. It starts over farmland at O’Shea Road, before climbing through tawa bush.
* Tirohanga Track (3–5 hr / km one way) starts at Corcoran Road, climbs to Ruapane , skirts the hornblende andesite dike of Tirohanga and undulates with some chains, before merging with the Mahaukura Track.
** Ruapane Track (1 hr 30 min one way), a longer alternative route to Ruapane, starts at Waite Road.
* Bell Track via Kaniwhaniwha Caves (6-10 hr / one way) starts with the Nikau Walk from Limeworks Loop Road. It stays in the valley to the kahikatea recorded as the tallest native tree at , then climbs to a series of clearings, one with a campsite. Beyond it is very muddy, as it climbs to the ridge and the Cone () and then passes Pāhautea Hut to the summit.
* Tahuanui Track (4–5 hr / km one way) also starts with the Nikau Walk from Limeworks Loop Road. It climbs steadily beside the Kaniwhaniwha valley, before a short descent and ascent to join the Tirohanga Track to the summit.
* Hihikiwi Track (4–6 hr / km one way) climbs many steps in bush from Pirongia West Road, then rises further to an up and down ridge, to reach Hihikiwi Lookout (), where there are views down the Ōpārau valley to Kawhia Harbour. From the lookout there is a boardwalk and steps down and up to the hut.

==== Lower tracks ====
There are also lower level tracks -

* Corcoran Road Lookout (15 min return ) a short, wheelchair accessible track, in bush to a viewpoint.
* Mangakara Nature Walk (1 hr / 1.5 km return) views examples of miro, tawa, rimu, kahikatea, mahoe, rewarewa, kareao, pukatea, nikau and kāmahi bush.
* Nikau Walk (2 hr 30 min / 7 km return) like the Bell and Tahuanui Tracks, this walk starts at Limeworks Loop Road, passes through an area planted around 2010, then follows the Kaniwhaniwha stream to a nikau palm and tree fern fringed loop walk. A further 30 minutes of walking allows a visit to the long Kaniwhaniwha Cave, through the limestone.
* Ōpārau Route (1 hr one way) from Pirongia West Road is unmarked and crosses farmland to the park boundary. The Ōpārau River is unbridged and impassable after heavy rain.
* Walter Scott Reserve (1 hr 30 min loop track) was given to the Waikato Branch of Forest and Bird in 1963 and gazetted as a reserve in 1966, but has since had its surrounding bush converted to farmland. The reserve has tawa-kāmahi forest with pukatea, miro and king fern.

==== Track history ====
Pirongia was surveyed in 1884, when a very sketchy map was drawn. A trip to the summit from Pirongia (probably now the Wharauroa Route) was described in 1876, was said to be, &quot;not always well marked&quot; in 1879, in 1922 it was reported there were no tracks and, in 1924, that part of the track had become overgrown. Ascents of Pirongia were often reported in newspapers.

=== Hut ===
Between the Summit and The Cone, at the junction of the Bell and Hihikiwi Tracks, a hut built in 2015 has 20 bunks. An older hut with 6 bunks is next to it.

<text>Andrés Nicolás D&#x27;Alessandro (born 15 April 1981) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He has played top-flight football in Argentina, Germany, England, Spain, Brazil and Uruguay.

He won an Olympic gold medal with Argentina in 2004 and also played at that year&#x27;s Copa América.

In 2020, he was awarded Brazilian citizenship.

==Club career==
===Early career===
D&#x27;Alessandro was born in the La Paternal section of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He joined the labor force as a pizza delivery boy before becoming a professional footballer. Known as &quot;El Cabezón&quot; (&quot;The Big Headed&quot;) for how large his big head looks on his small frame rather than any ego connotations, he emerged through the River Plate youth system that has produced much of Argentina&#x27;s top talent over the years. He followed the likes of Santiago Solari and Pablo Aimar through the ranks, together with Javier Saviola, with whom he shared the limelight in the 2001 Youth World Championship. With the River Plate senior team, he won the 2001–02 and 2002–03 Primera División titles.

===Spell in Europe===
D&#x27;Alessandro attracted attention from European clubs following his success and performances at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. He eventually transferred to Wolfsburg in July 2003 for a club record €9 million. On 21 September 2005, D&#x27;Alessandro scored the Bundesliga&#x27;s 40,000th goal since its creation in 1963, netting the fourth goal in a 4–2 victory over Hannover 96.

On 31 January 2006, to the surprise of most fans, D&#x27;Alessandro joined English Premier League club Portsmouth on loan for the remainder of the season. His main objective with his new club was to blend in with new teammates and help his club to avoid relegation. On Easter Monday, 17 April, he scored his first goal in English football – a contender for goal of the season – in Portsmouth&#x27;s 2–1 defeat away to Charlton Athletic.

Portsmouth survived and manager Harry Redknapp sought to sign D&#x27;Alessandro on a permanent basis. But he was attracting the attention of many European clubs with strong interest from the likes of Atlético Madrid and Benfica. On 17 June he ended the speculation regarding his career by completing a season-long loan switch to La Liga outfit Real Zaragoza, citing his desire to play in Spain as a major factor in his decision. On 6 June 2007, he signed a contract at Zaragoza, keeping him at the club until 2011.

===Return to South America===
In 2008, he joined his former River Plate manager Ramón Díaz at Argentine club San Lorenzo. However, after Díaz left the club, D&#x27;Alesandro opted to move to Brazil to play for Internacional. Playing for the former Copa Libertadores champions, he described as a &quot;step forward&quot; in his career.

On 13 December 2008 it was reported on ESPN Deportes that the Los Angeles Galaxy had made a $10 million offer to Internacional for D&#x27;Alesandro but was declined. Their vice president Fernando Carvalho was quoted; &quot;The offer came from the Los Angeles Galaxy of the United States. I didn&#x27;t even want to listen to the details. The offer was for more money than we paid for D&#x27;Alessandro, who arrived here for five million euro, but we want to keep the Argentinian.&quot; D&#x27;Alessandro has become one of Internacional&#x27;s most idolized players of all time along the likes of Falcão, Valdomiro, and Fernandão. In 2008, he was part of Inter&#x27;s Sulamericana Championship. In 2009 Internacional finished in second place in both the Brasileirão and Copa do Brasil. In 2010, D&#x27;Alessandro led Internacional to their second Libertadores Championship, and was elected the best player in South America for that year; in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, he also helped Internacional to a third-place finish, and was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament&#x27;s third best player. In 2011 D&#x27;Alessadro had personally an even better year, but Internacional only managed to win the State Gaucho Championship. 2012 was a bad year for both Internacional and D&#x27;Alessandro. Furthermore, rumours of him leaving to play in China caused a major distraction; after long drawn out drama he stayed but soon was injured. In 2013 his game improved again, and while Inter only won the State Championship, he was praised as the only positive factor of the team that year. 2014 started well; D&#x27;Alessandro continued to play well and led Inter to their 4th straight Gaucho Championship.

On 3 February 2016, he returned to River Plate after years on a loan deal. He won his second Recopa Sudamericana and the Copa Argentina during his stay at the club. After that, he returned to Internacional de Porto Alegre on Dec 2016, and his successful career continues in this latter.

==International career==
D&#x27;Alessandro won the 2001 Under-20 World Championship with the Argentine youth side, held in Buenos Aires; due to his performances alongside his club teammate Javier Saviola, he was awarded the Silver Ball as the tournament&#x27;s second best player. D&#x27;Alessandro had originally started the tournament as a substitute, but injuries allowed him a place in the team in later matches. Argentina beat Ghana 3–0 in the final.

D&#x27;Alessandro has represented Argentina&#x27;s senior side on 28 occasions, scoring 4 times between 2001 and 2011. He also represented Argentina&#x27;s under-23 side at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, where Argentina won a gold medal.

D&#x27;Alessandro also took part in the 2004 Copa América with Argentina. He scored his only goal of the tournament in the group stage, in Argentina&#x27;s 6–1 victory over Ecuador In the final, against rivals Brazil, he missed Argentina&#x27;s first penalty in the resulting shootout, following a 2–2 draw after extra time; Argentina were defeated 4–2 in the shootout.

On 20 August 2010, Sergio Batista recalled D&#x27;Alessandro to the national team for a friendly against Spain, which was played on 7 September 2010 at the Monumental Stadium River Plate.

==Style of play==
A talented attacking midfielder, D&#x27;Alessandro is best known for his dribbling ability, creativity, and technical skill, and is capable beating players with body feints and tricks, such as the dragback (&quot;boba&quot;), nutmeg, or the Blomqvist shuffle; he is also an accurate free-kick taker. D&#x27;Alessandro is also known for his short passing ability, which makes him a capable assist provider.

In 2001, he was named one of the 100 best young footballers in the world by &quot;Don Balón&quot;, and he was also labelled one of Maradona&#x27;s potential heirs by the media and by Maradona himself; despite his precocious talent however, he was not able to fully fulfill the potential he demonstrated in his youth.

<text>George London (born George Burnstein; May 30, 1920 – March 24, 1985) was an American concert and operatic bass-baritone.

== Biography ==
George Burnstein was born to U.S. naturalized parents of Russian origin in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and grew up in Los Angeles, California. His operatic debut was in 1941 as George Burnson, singing Dr Grenvil in &quot;La traviata&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl. In the summer of 1945 Antal Doráti invited his longtime friend, the Hungarian bass Mihály Székely, to sing at the first concert of the newly reorganized Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Due to travel difficulties, Székely was unable to arrive in time, so Doráti called upon young George London as a substitute.

After performing widely with tenor Mario Lanza and soprano Frances Yeend as part of the Bel Canto Trio in 1947–48, London was engaged by the Vienna State Opera, where he scored his first major success in 1949. In 1950, he sang the role of Pater Profundis in Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony, conducted by Leopold Stokowski, with Carlos Alexander and Eugene Conley among the other soloists.

He was among the most famous exponents of his five signature roles: Don Giovanni, Boris Godunov, Wotan, Scarpia and Amfortas. He never recorded any role in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, although recital performances of Hans Sachs&#x27; monologues exist on record.

In 1951 he sang at the Bayreuth Festival as Amfortas in &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and reappeared frequently in the 1950s and early 1960s as Amfortas and in the title role of &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;. He made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in 1951 as Amonasro in &quot;Aida&quot;, and sang over 270 performances, both baritone and bass roles, such as Figaro and Count Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, The Speaker in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Mandryka in &quot;Arabella&quot;, Scarpia in &quot;Tosca&quot;, the title role in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Boris in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, Escamillo in &quot;Carmen&quot;, Iago in &quot;Otello&quot;, Amfortas in &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Wolfram in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, the four villains in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, Golaud in &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, and Mephistopheles in &quot;Faust&quot;.

In 1964, he created the role of Abdul in the American premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Last Savage&quot;. He was the first North American to sing the title role of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, at the height of the Cold War in 1960.

He frequently performed in English: Broadway show tunes and negro spirituals. He recorded many of his roles for RCA Victor, Columbia Records, and Decca. He recorded Verdi&#x27;s Requiem with Richard Tucker and Lucine Amara, under Eugene Ormandy. He also recorded Puccini&#x27;s Tosca with Mario Del Monaco and Renata Tebaldi under Francesco Molinari-Pradelli conducting the Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. A recording of a live concert with piano accompaniment is also available from VAI, which includes Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot;, as well as several Schubert Lieder and a variety of songs in English.

During his Met career, in 1956, he appeared on Ed Sullivan&#x27;s television program in an abridged version of act 2 of &quot;Tosca&quot;, opposite Maria Callas, conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos. A kinescope of that performance was preserved. Another black-and-white videotape of him in the same role, opposite Renata Tebaldi in a complete performance, is sometimes available. In 1958, London performed the leading role of Wotan, in the groundbreaking recording of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, conducted by Georg Solti, and produced by John Culshaw for Decca.

Having already sung the &quot;Rheingold&quot; Wotan and the &quot;Siegfried&quot; Wanderer roles at the Met in New York in December 1961 and January 1962, he was ready to sing his first complete &quot;Ring Cycle&quot;. This was to be the now legendary new production mounted by Wieland Wagner at the Cologne Opera in West Germany in May 1962. Wieland Wagner was ready to try out new singers and production ideas in advance of his new Bayreuth Festival production which was scheduled for the summer of 1965 with London as Wotan and the Wanderer.

The Cologne &quot;Ring&quot; proved to be a great success (a private recording of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; from this cycle exists to verify this) but London&#x27;s vocal health began to deteriorate rapidly during the 1963/64 season; subsequently the problem was diagnosed as a paralysed vocal cord. This problem increased so much that shortly after singing Wotan in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; at the Met in March 1965, he canceled his upcoming appearances at the Bayreuth Festival to rest and ideally recover his voice.

However, his vocal decline continued so severely that by March 1966, he performed his last appearance at the Metropolitan Opera: the role of Amfortas in &quot;Parsifal&quot;. London subsequently received injections of Teflon in his paralyzed vocal cord – then the state-of-the-art treatment for this condition – which filled it out and therefore restored his voice to some extent. But he decided the improvement did not let him achieve again his self-imposed highest standards. He therefore ended his singing career in 1967, at 46.

== George London Foundation ==
In 1971, London established the George London Foundation for Singers, which gives grants to young opera singers early in their careers. $80,000 is given each year to the winners of an annual competition.

== Directing ==
In 1975, he directed the first &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; produced by Seattle Opera, creating its &quot;Pacific Northwest Wagner Festival&quot;. From 1975 until 1977 he was general director of the Washington Opera.

== Vocal signature ==
His voice was large, dark and resonant with a massive, penetrating top. Although it was also rather thickly-textured, London at his best commanded a wide range of dynamics, from delicate &quot;pianississimi&quot; to resounding &quot;fortes&quot;. His musicianship won him acclaim on three continents. London was also a fine actor with a robust stage presence; he was tall, powerfully built and striking.

London&#x27;s talent was celebrated twice before his death. In the Carnegie Hall concert of 1981, introduced by Beverly Sills, performances were given by a long list of colleagues. In Vienna, 1984, some of the world&#x27;s greatest singers assembled to honor the artist.

== Health issues and death ==
In the 1960s, his voice began to deteriorate and partial vocal paralysis was diagnosed. He took injections of silicone and teflon, but did not improve. In 1977, a massive heart attack left him half paralyzed, with brain damage. After that, his health inexorably declined. A few years later, he managed to survive a second heart attack. On March 24, 1985, he died in Armonk, New York, after a third heart attack. He was 64 years old.

<doc id="1186463" wikidata="Q4115017" url="?curid=1186463" title="Islam in Somalia">
<text>Practitioners of Islam first entered Somalia in the northwestern city of Zeila during prophet Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime whereupon they built the Masjid al-Qiblatayn; as such, Islam has been a part of Somali society since the 7th century. 

Practicing Islam reinforces distinctions that further set Somalis apart from their immediate neighbors. Sunnism is the strand practiced by 90% of the population. Although Pew Research Center has not conducted a survey in Somalia, its Somali-majority northwestern neighbour Djibouti reported a creed breakdown of Muslims which was reported as 77% adhering to Sunnism, 8% as non-denominational Muslim, 2% as Shia, thirteen percent refusing to answer, and a further report inclusive of Somali Region stipulating 2% adherence to a minority sect (e.g. Ibadism, Quranism etc.).

The role of religious functionaries began to shrink in the 1950s and 1960s as some of their legal and educational powers and responsibilities were transferred to secular authorities. The position of religious leaders changed substantially after the 1969 revolution and the introduction of scientific socialism. Siad Barre insisted that his version of socialism was compatible with Qur&#x27;anic principles, and he condemned atheism. Religious leaders, however, were warned not to meddle in politics.

== History ==
=== Birth of Islam and Middle Ages ===

Islam was introduced to the northern Somali coast early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. Zeila&#x27;s two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque in the country. Somalis were among the earliest non-Arabs to convert to Islam. Several prominent shaykhs are traditionally credited with spreading Islam in Somalia, including Aw Barhadle, Aw Qudub, Aw Cisman Fiqi Cumar (“Garweyne”), and Aw Cisman Xasan Bin Cakaabir.

In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city, suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local Somali dynasties, who also ruled over the similarly-established Sultanate of Mogadishu in the littoral Benadir region to the south. Adal&#x27;s history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighboring Abyssinia.

In 1332, the Zeila-based King of Adal was slain in a military campaign aimed at halting the Abyssinian Emperor Amda Seyon I&#x27;s march toward the city to avenge the slaughtered Christians including a famous monk sent to wage peace and destroyed Churches by the Adalites. When the last Sultan of Ifat, Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din II, was also killed by Emperor Dawit I in Zeila in 1410, his children escaped to Yemen, before later returning in 1415. In the early 15th century, Adal&#x27;s capital was moved further inland to the town of Dakkar, where Sabr ad-Din II, the eldest son of Sa&#x27;ad ad-Din II, established a new base after his return from Yemen.

Adal&#x27;s headquarters were again relocated the following century, this time to Harar. From this new capital, Adal organized an effective army led by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (Ahmad &quot;Gurey&quot; or &quot;Gran&quot;) that invaded the Abyssinian empire. This 16th century campaign is historically known as the Conquest of Abyssinia (&quot;Futuh al-Habash&quot;). During the war, Imam Ahmad pioneered the use of cannons and firearms supplied by the Ottoman Empire, which he imported through Zeila and thousands of mercenaries from the Muslim world and nomadic Somalia to wage a &#x27;holy war&#x27; against Ethiopian King of Kings. The few Portuguese under Cristóvão da Gama that later that came to assist their Ethoipian coreligionist would tip the scale in their favour. Some scholars argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms like the matchlock musket, cannons and the arquebus over traditional weapons. By the 16th century, Somali Muslims cultivated religious ties with the BaʿAlawī Husaynis from Hadramawt, adopting aspects of their tradition. In 1503, Shaykh Sharif Abu Bakr al-Aydarus al-ʿAdanī introduced the Qadiriyya Sufi order into the Horn of Africa. 

During the Age of the Ajuran, the sultanates and republics of Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, Hobyo flourished and had a lucrative foreign commerce, with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia, India, Venetia, Persia, Egypt, Portugal and as far away as China. Vasco da Gama, who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century, noted that it was a large city with houses several storeys high and large palaces in its center, in addition to many mosques with cylindrical minarets. 

The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the &quot;City of Islam&quot;, and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries. In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya in modern-day India sailed to Mogadishu with cloth and spices, for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory. Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants. Mogadishu was also the center of a thriving textile industry known as &quot;toob benadir&quot;, specialized for the markets in Egypt, among other places.

=== Modern era ===

Because Muslims believe that their faith was revealed in its complete form to Muhammad, Bidʻah is seen as a major sin. One response was to stress a return to orthodox Muslim traditions and to oppose Westernization totally. The Sufi brotherhoods were at the forefront of this movement, personified in Somalia by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan in the early 20th century. Generally, the leaders of Islamic orders opposed the spread of Western education.

Another response was to reform Islam by reinterpreting it. From this perspective, early Islam was seen as a protest against abuse, corruption, and inequality; reformers therefore attempted to prove that Muslim scriptures contained all elements needed to deal with modernization. To this school of thought belongs Islamic socialism, identified particularly with Egyptian nationalist Gamal Abdul Nasser. His ideas appealed to a number of Somalis, especially those who had studied in Cairo in the 1950s and 1960s.

The 1961 constitution guaranteed freedom of religion but also declared the newly independent republic an Islamic state. The first two post-independence governments paid lip service to the principles of Islamic socialism but made relatively few changes. The coup of October 21, 1969, installed a radical regime committed to profound change. Shortly afterward, Stella d&#x27;Ottobre, the official newspaper of the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), published an editorial about relations between Islam and socialism and the differences between scientific and Islamic socialism. Islamic socialism was said to have become a servant of capitalism and neocolonialism and a tool manipulated by a privileged, rich, and powerful class. In contrast, scientific socialism was based on the altruistic values that inspired genuine Islam. Religious leaders should therefore leave secular affairs to the new leaders who were striving for goals that conformed with Islamic principles. Soon after, the government arrested several protesting religious leaders and accused them of counterrevolutionary propaganda and of conniving with reactionary elements in the Arabian Peninsula. The authorities also dismissed several members of religious tribunals for corruption and incompetence.
When the Three-Year Plan, 1971–1973, was launched in January 1971, SRC leaders felt compelled to win the support of religious leaders so as to transform the existing social structure. On September 4, 1971, Siad Barre exhorted more than 100 religious teachers to participate in building a new socialist society. He criticized their method of teaching in Qur&#x27;anic schools and charged some with using religion for personal profit.

The campaign for scientific socialism intensified in 1972. On the occasion of Eid al-Adha, the major Muslim festival associated with the pilgrimage, the president defined scientific socialism as half practical work and half ideological belief. He declared that work and belief were compatible with Islam because the Qur&#x27;an condemned exploitation and money lending and urged compassion, unity, and cooperation among Muslims. But he stressed the distinction between religion as an ideological instrument for the manipulation of power and as a moral force. He condemned the antireligious attitude of Marxists. Religion, Siad Barre said, was an integral part of the Somali worldview, but it belonged in the private sphere, whereas scientific socialism dealt with material concerns such as poverty. Religious leaders should exercise their moral influence but refrain from interfering in political or economic matters.

Religious orders always have played a significant role in Somali Islam. The rise of these orders (Tarika, &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;) was connected with the development of Sufism, a mystical sect within Islam that began during the 9th and 10th centuries and reached its height during the 12th and 13th. In Somalia, Sufi orders appeared in towns during the 15th century and rapidly became a revitalizing force. Followers of Sufism seek a closer personal relationship to God through special spiritual disciplines. Escape from self is facilitated by poverty, seclusion, and other forms of self-denial. Members of Sufi orders are commonly called dervishes, from the Persian &quot;daraawish&quot; (singular darwish, &quot;one who gave up worldly concerns to dedicate himself to the service of God and community&quot;). Leaders of branches or congregations of these orders are given the Arabic title &quot;shaykh&quot;, a term usually reserved for those learned in Islam and rarely applied to ordinary &quot;wadaads&quot; (holy men).

Dervishes wandered from place to place teaching. They are best known for their ceremonies, called dhikr, in which states of visionary ecstasy are induced by group- chanting of religious texts and by rhythmic gestures, dancing, and deep breathing. The object is to free oneself from the body and to be lifted into the presence of God. Dervishes have been important as founders of agricultural religious communities called &quot;jamaat&quot; (singular jamaa). A few of these were home to celibate men only, but usually the jamaat were inhabited by families. Most Somalis were nominal members of Sufi orders.
Local leaders of brotherhoods customarily asked lineage heads in the areas where they wished to settle for permission to build their mosques and communities. A piece of land was usually freely given; often it was an area between two clans or one in which nomads had access to a river. The presence of a jama&#x27;ah not only provided a buffer zone between two hostile groups, but also caused the giver to acquire a blessing since the land was considered given to God. Tenure was a matter of charity only, however, and sometimes became precarious in case of disagreements. No statistics were available in 1990 on the number of such settlements, but in the 1950s there were more than ninety in the south, with a total of about 35,000 members. Most were in the Bakool, Gedo, and Bay regions or along the middle and lower Shabele River. There were few jamaat in other regions because the climate and soil did not encourage agricultural settlements.

Membership in a brotherhood is theoretically a voluntary matter unrelated to kinship. However, lineages are often affiliated with a specific brotherhood and a man usually joins his father&#x27;s order. Initiation is followed by a ceremony during which the order&#x27;s dhikr is celebrated. Novices swear to accept the branch head as their spiritual guide.

Each order has its own hierarchy that is supposedly a substitute for the kin group from which the members have separated themselves. Veneration is given to previous heads of the order, known as the Chain of Blessing, rather than to ancestors. This practice is especially followed in the south, where place of residence tends to have more significance than lineage.
Because of the saint&#x27;s spiritual presence at his tomb, Sufi pilgrims journey there to pray for them and send blessings to them. Members of the saint&#x27;s order also visit the tomb, particularly on the anniversaries of his birth and death. Leaders of Sufi orders and their branches and of specific congregations are said to have &quot;baraka&quot;, a state of blessedness implying an inner spiritual power that is inherent in the religious office, and may cling to the tomb of a revered leader, who, upon death, is considered a pious Muslim. However, some religious leaders are venerated by Sufis because of their religious reputations, whether or not they were associated with an order or one of its communities. Sainthood also has been ascribed to other Sufis because of their status as founders of clans or large lineages. Northern pastoral nomads are likely to honor lineage founders as saints; sedentary Somalis revere saints for their piety and baraka.

The traditional learning of a wadaad includes a form of folk astronomy based on stellar movements and related to seasonal changes. Its primary objective is to signal the times for migration, but it may also be used to set the dates of rituals that are specifically Somali. This folk knowledge is also used in ritual methods of healing and averting misfortune, as well as for divination.

Wadaddo help avert misfortune by making protective amulets and charms that transmit some of their baraka to others, or by adding the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s baraka to the amulet through a written passage. The baraka of a saint may be obtained in the form of an object that has touched or been placed near his tomb.

Although wadaddo may use their power to curse as a sanction, misfortune generally is not attributed to curses or witchcraft. Somalis have accepted the orthodox Muslim view that a man&#x27;s conduct will be judged in an afterlife. However, a person who commits an antisocial act, such as patricide, is thought possessed of supernatural evil powers.

Like other Muslims, Somalis believe in jinn. Certain kinds of illness, including tuberculosis and pneumonia, or symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, are believed by some Somalis to result from spirit possession, namely, the Ifrit of the spirit world. The condition is treated by a shaykh, who reads portions of the Qur&#x27;an over the patient repeatedly.

Yibir clan members are popularly held to be descendants of Jewish Hebrew forebears. The etymology of the word &quot;Yibir&quot; is also believed by some to have come from the word for &quot;Hebrew&quot;. However, spokespersons for the Yibir have generally not tried to make their presence known to Jewish/Israeli authorities. Despite their putative Jewish origins, the overwhelming majority of the Yibir, like the Somali population in general, adhere to Islam and know practically nothing of Judaism.

== Denominations ==
=== Liberal Islam ===
In early January 1975, evoking the message of equality, justice, and social progress contained in the Qur&#x27;an, Siad Barre announced a new family law that gave women the right to inheritance on an equal basis with men. Some Somalis believe the law was proof that the SRC wanted to undermine the basic structure of Islamic society. In Mogadishu twenty-three religious leaders protested inside their mosques. They were arrested and charged with acting at the instigation of a foreign power and with violating state security; ten were executed. Sheikh Ahmed Sheikh Mohamed Walaaleeye and Sheikh Hassan Absiye Derie were among them. Most religious leaders, however, kept silent. The government continued to organize training courses for shaykhs in scientific socialism.

=== Sunni ===
For generations, &quot;Islam in Somalia&quot; leaned towards the Shafi’i jurisprudence, and Sufism, until recent decades when Salafism has made inroads. Influence of Islamic religious leaders has varied by region, being greater in the north than among some groups in the settled regions of the south. Among nomads, the exigencies of pastoral life gave greater weight to the warrior&#x27;s role, and religious leaders were expected to remain aloof from political matters.

=== Sufism ===
Three Sufi orders were prominent in Somalia. In order of their introduction into the country, they were the Qadiriyah, the Idrisiyah, and the Salihiyya. The Rifaiyah, an offshoot of the Qadiriyah, was represented mainly among Arabs resident in Mogadishu.

==== Qadiriya ====
The Qadiriyah, the oldest Sufi order, was founded in Baghdad by Abdul Qadir al-Jilani in 1166 and introduced to the Somali Adal in the 15th century. During the 18th century, it was spread among the Oromo and the Afar of Ethiopia, often under the leadership of Somali shaykhs. Its earliest known advocate in northern Somalia was Shaykh Abd ar Rahman az Zeilawi, who died in 1883. At that time, Qadiriyah adherents were merchants in the ports and elsewhere. In a separate development, the Qadiriyah order also spread into the southern Somali port cities of Baraawe and Mogadishu at an uncertain date. In 1819, Shaykh Ibrahim Hassan Jebro acquired land on the Jubba River and established a religious center in the form of a farming community, the first Somali jama&#x27;ah (congregation).

Outstanding figures of the Qadiriyah in Somalia included Shaykh Awes Mahammad Baraawi (d. 1909), who spread the teaching of the Sufi order in the southern interior. He wrote much devotional poetry in Arabic and attempted to translate traditional hymns from Arabic into Somali, working out his own phonetic system. Another was Shaykh Abdirrahman Abdullah of Mogadishu, who stressed deep mysticism. Because of his reputation for sanctity, his tomb at Mogadishu became a pilgrimage center for the Shebelle valley and his writings continued to be circulated by his followers as late as the early 1990s.
==== Idrisiya ====
The Idrisiyah order was founded by Ahmad ibn Idris (1760–1837) of Mecca. It was brought to Somalia by Shaykh Ali Maye Durogba of Merca in Somalia, a distinguished poet who joined the order during a pilgrimage to Mecca. His &quot;visions&quot; and &quot;miracles&quot; attributed to him gained him a reputation for sanctity, and his tomb became a popular destination for pilgrims. The Idrisiyah, the smallest of the three Sufi orders, has few ritual requirements beyond some simple prayers and hymns. During its ceremonies, however, participants often go into trances. A conflict over the leadership of the Idrisiyah among its Arab founders led to the establishment of the Salihiyah in 1887 by Muhammad ibn Salih. One of the Salihiyah&#x27;s proselytizers was former slave Shaykh Mahammad Guled ar Rashidi, who became a regional leader. He settled among the Shidle people (Bantus occupying the middle reaches of the Shebelle River), where he obtained land and established a jama&#x27;ah. Later he founded another jama&#x27;ah among the Ajuran (a section of the Hawiye clanfamily ) and then returned to establish still another community among the Shidle before his death in 1918.

==== Salihiyya ====

A Somali form of the Salihiya tariqa was established in what is now northern Somalia in 1890 by Ismail Urwayni. Urwayni&#x27;s proselytism in northern Somalia had a profound effect on the peninsula as it would later prompt the creation of the Darwiish State. The primary friction between the more established Qadiriya and the newly established Somali Salihism in the form of Urwayniya was their reaction to incursions by European colonialists with the former appearing too lax by adherents of the latter. Five years later, another neo-Salihiya figure expedited Urwaynism or Urwayniya through proselytizing, via the Darawiish wherein Diiriye Guure was sultan and wherein the Salihiyya preacher Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, would become emir of the Dervish movement in a lengthy resistance to the Abyssinian, Italian and British colonialists until 1920.

Generally, the Salihiyah and the Idrisiyah leaders were more interested in the establishment of a jama&#x27;ah along the Shabeelle and Jubba rivers and the fertile land between them than in teaching because few were learned in Islam. Their early efforts to establish farming communities resulted in cooperative cultivation and harvesting and some effective agricultural methods. In Somalia&#x27;s riverine region, for example, only jama&#x27;ah members thought of stripping the brush from areas around their fields to reduce the breeding places of tsetse flies.

=== Salafism and Zahirism ===

Following the outbreak of the civil war in the early 1990s, Islamism appeared to be largely confined to the radical Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya group. In 1992, Colonel Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed marshalled forces to successfully expel an Islamist extremist group linked to the outfit, which had laid siege to Bosaso, a prominent port city and the commercial capital of the northeastern part of the country. The turn of the 21st century saw an increasing prevalence of puritanical Sunnism, including in the form of Muwahhidism and Salafism.

Although there is no official demographic figures on Zahirism in Somalia, many Somalis follow methods of practicing Islam that aligns with Zahiri beliefs, such as a suspicion towards human authority regarding Islamic legal matters.

=== Shia ===
There has never been a comprehensive survey on religious affiliation in Somalia, and as such, figures on adherence are largely based upon speculation. The historian David Westerlund refers to both Shia and Wahhabi (Hanbali &quot;madhab&quot;) sects in Somalia as relatively recent developments.

Ibn Battuta in his travels to Zeila, in northwest Somalia, in the 14th century, described it as a town of Shiites. The city of Zeila began to gradually lose its Shiite character during the period between 1623 and 1639, when the Ottoman administrators came to increasingly regard the Shiism practised by the local Somali Shiites as heretic due to the ongoing Safavid-Ottoman War against Safi of Persia.

The Saudi invasion of Yemen in 2015 resulted in large amounts of Zaydi Shia Yemeni refugees seeking refuge in northern Somalia.

=== Non-denominational Muslim ===
Although there has never been a comprehensive census in Somalia that lists various Islamic denominations as an option, there have been some Somalis in the diaspora who have used the self-description of &quot;just a Muslim&quot; upon probes into their religious affiliation.

=== Ibadi ===
Ibadism is predominant in Oman and is characterized by the acceptance of fewer hadiths, and the acceptance of Jami Sahih and Tartib al-Musnad as canonical hadith collections. Although Ibadism has not officially been reported being practiced in Somalia, certain Eastern Harti clans who migrated from Somalia in the medieval period whom are known as Dishiishes or Muhdis live in modest numbers in Oman, wherein Ibadism is the state religion.

<text>Cathryn Lee Damon (September 11, 1930 – May 4, 1987) was an American actress known for her roles in sitcoms in the 1970s and 1980s. She was best known as Mary Campbell in &quot;Soap&quot;, for which she was nominated three times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, winning in 1980.

==Early years==
Damon was the elder daughter of Lee Frank Damon and Mary Cathryn Atwood. Her parents divorced and her mother married Walter A. Springer.

Damon was born in Seattle and raised in Tacoma and graduated from Stadium High School. As a child, she felt insecure, saying: &quot;I never thought I was attractive enough. I never thought I was good enough.&quot; She also felt as a child she was responsible for her parents&#x27; divorce. She moved to New York City at age 16 to pursue ballet.

== Career ==
Damon began her career as a ballerina, dancing in the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance Festival in Lee, Massachusetts, and performing with the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s dance company.

Off-Broadway plays in which Damon appeared included &quot;The Boys From Syracuse&quot;. and &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;.
She appeared in several Broadway productions, including &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;; &quot;Foxy&quot;; &quot;Flora, The Red Menace&quot;; &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;; &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;; &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. During the 1967–68 season, she appeared in &quot;Dames at Sea&quot; at the Wayside Theatre and understudied the roles of both Mame Dennis and Vera Charles in Angela Lansbury&#x27;s national tour of &quot;Mame&quot;.

Damon became familiar to television viewers as middle-class Mary Campbell on the primetime spoof of daytime soap operas aptly entitled &quot;Soap&quot; from 1977–1981. However, many fans may not know that she was the third and final actress cast in the role. Producer Tony Thomas said, &quot;Cathryn Damon was brilliant. A lot of people don&#x27;t know this, but we recast that to put her in it.&quot; She later appeared with &quot;Soap&quot; co-star Eugene Roche on &quot;Webster&quot; from 1984–1986. The pair played Cassie and Bill Parker, Webster&#x27;s landlords, on the hit series. Other television credits included guest roles on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, and &quot;Mike Hammer&quot;.

Damon, along with costar and TV husband Richard Mulligan, won an Emmy Award for &quot;Soap&quot; in 1980 but could not appear in person to receive the award in person or give her speech, owing to an actors&#x27; strike. Mulligan referred to his late co-star (whom he affectionately called &quot;Toots&quot;) and her strike-related absence when he received his second Best Actor Emmy more than a decade later for his role as Dr. Weston on the television series &quot;Empty Nest&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In August 1953, Damon married Richard Price Towers, an actor and singer, in New York City.

==Illness and death==
In 1986, Damon was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but continued acting in small roles up until shortly before her death a year later at age 56, on May 4, 1987. She died in Los Angeles at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Her final role, as Elizabeth McGovern&#x27;s mother in the movie &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; with Kevin Bacon, was released posthumously. She is interred in Acacia Memorial Park near Seattle.

<doc id="1186485" wikidata="Q584612" url="?curid=1186485" title="Islam in Chad">
<text>The earliest presence of [[Islam]] in [[Chad]] can be traced back to Uqba ibn Nafi, whose descendants can be found settled in the Lake Chad region to this day. By the time Arab migrants began arriving from the east in the fourteenth century in sizeable numbers, the creed was already well established. Islamization in Chad was gradual, the effect of the slow spread of Islamic civilization beyond its political frontiers. Among Chadian Muslims, 48% professed to be Sunni, 21% Shia, 23% just Muslim and 4% Other.

Islam in Chad was not influenced much by the great mystical movements of the Islamic Middle Ages, nor the fundamentalist upheavals that affected other countries. Consistent contact with West African Muslim traders and pilgrims may be the reason Chadian Muslims identify with the Tijaniyya order. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, the Sanusiyya brotherhood was founded in Libya, which benefited from economic and political influence in the Lake Chad Basin around 1900. An Islamic revival movement, feared by some French, led by Sanusi fanatics, Chadian adherents, limited to the Awlad Sulayman Arabs and the Toubou of eastern Tibesti, have never been numerous.

Higher Islamic education in Chad is sparse; thus, serious Islamic students and scholars must travel to other countries. Scholars travel abroad to places such as Khartoum and Cairo, where Chadians attend Al Azhar.

Chadians observe the five pillars of the faith differently than the orthodox version. Prayer, both public and communal, occur more than once a week, but often not in a mosque. Chadian Muslims likely make the pilgrimage less often than Hausans in northern Nigeria. Some Chadian Muslims follow the Ramadan fast stricter than typical, with some refusing to swallow their saliva during the day.

<doc id="1186492" wikidata="Q1057284" url="?curid=1186492" title="Portuñol">
<text>Portuñol (Spanish spelling) or Portunhol (Portuguese spelling) () is a portmanteau of the words portugués/português (&quot;Portuguese&quot;) and español/espanhol (&quot;Spanish&quot;), and is the name often given to any non-systematic mixture of Portuguese and Spanish (this sense should not be confused with the dialects of the Portuguese language spoken in northern Uruguay by the Brazilian border, known by several names, among them &quot;Portuñol&quot;). Close examination reveals it to be &quot;a polyvalent term (&quot;portuñol&quot;/&quot;portunhol&quot;) used to describe a wide range of phenomena, including spontaneous contact vernaculars in border regions, errors produced by speakers attempting to speak the second language (L2) correctly, and idiosyncratic invented speech designed to facilitate communication between the two languages.&quot;

Portuñol/Portunhol is frequently a pidgin, or simplified mixture of the two languages, that allows speakers of either Spanish or Portuguese who are not proficient in the other language to communicate with one another. When speakers of one of the languages attempt to speak the other language, there is often interference from the native language, which causes the phenomenon of code-switching to occur. It is possible to conduct a moderately fluent conversation in this way because Portuguese and Spanish are closely related Romance languages. They have almost identical syntactic structures, as well as overlapping lexicons due to cognates, which means that a single macro-grammar is produced when the two mix. An example for literary effect, &quot;not based on accurate imitations of the speech of border regions&quot;, is the phrase &quot;en el hueco de la noite longa e langue&quot;, illustrating a code-mix of the Spanish article &quot;la&quot; and the Portuguese noun &quot;noite&quot;.

== Origins ==
Language contact between Spanish and Portuguese is a result of sustained contact between the two languages in border communities and multilingual trade environments. Such regions include the border regions between Portugal and Spain in the Iberian Peninsula, as well as the ones between Brazil, whose official language is Portuguese, and most of its neighboring countries whose official languages are Spanish. Because &quot;Portuñol&quot; is a spontaneous register resulting from the occasional mixing of Spanish and Portuguese, it is highly diverse; there is no one dialect or standard of &quot;Portuñol&quot;. There does, however, tend to be a stronger presence of Spanish in &quot;Portuñol&quot;.

== Contemporary ==
In recent years, &quot;Portuñol&quot; has begun to appear in realms other than everyday speech. It has become a literary medium, especially in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Language professor María Jesus Fernández García states that literary registers only occasionally provide a true representation of &quot;Portuñol&quot;, and that authors often choose to select only some of the features that it is characterized by; she thus describes it as a linguistic recreation of the actual language. One important literary work written in &quot;Portuñol&quot; is &quot;Mar paraguayo&quot; by Brazilian author . The passage below shows the mixing of Spanish and Portuguese in his novel.

In recent decades, some Portuguese-based creole languages have also become influenced by standard Spanish, notably Annobonese and the Aruban dialect of Papiamento.

The appearance of &quot;Portuñol&quot; has prompted two opposing opinions or attitudes towards its existence. On the one hand, it is viewed as the product of laziness among speakers unwilling to learn a different language. On the other hand, it is seen as the logical product of globalization. As far as the future of &quot;Portuñol&quot; is concerned, according to Francisco A. Marcos-Marín, it is too difficult to evaluate possible repercussions that &quot;Portuñol&quot; could have on future linguistic maps because it is not easy to separate linguistic tendencies that are merely in style and those that are permanent.

== Compared to Mirandese ==
The colloquial dialect of Portuñol is similar to but different from Mirandese, or &quot;Mirandês&quot; in Portuguese. The Mirandese language is spoken by approximately 15,000 people in northeastern Portugal. The regional language has several similarities to both Portuguese and Spanish languages, but it is a direct descendant of Asturo-Leonese.

<doc id="1186499" wikidata="Q7335853" url="?curid=1186499" title="Risdon Prison Complex">
<text>Risdon Prison Complex is an Australian medium to maximum security prison for males located in Risdon Vale near Hobart, Tasmania. The facility is operated by the Tasmanian Prison Service, an agency of the Department of Justice of the Government of Tasmania. The facility accepts criminals convicted under Tasmanian and/or Commonwealth legislation.

The complex comprises 219 maximum security cells for males; 84 medium security cells for males; and a 38-bed secure mental health unit called the Wilfred Lopes Centre for Forensic Mental Health. A separate 45-bed women&#x27;s prison, called the Mary Hutchinson Women&#x27;s Prison, is located adjacent to the Risdon Prison Complex. The complex was formerly known as HM Prison Risdon.

==History==
Correctional facilities at Risdon have been constructed in two phases, between 1956 and 1963, and again between 2001 and 2006.

A series of escapes from the Campbell Street Gaol in Hobart resulted in a 1943 Royal Commission into the H.M. Gaol Department. In 1949 the Department obtained by compulsory acquisition a property on the eastern side of the Derwent River, not far from Risdon Cove where the initial European settlement of Tasmania occurred. In 1956, plans commenced to design the prison and construction was completed in 1960.

Facilities for female prisoners were completed in 1963, and inmates were moved from Campbell Street Gaol, resulting in closure of the Campbell Street Gaol. The new women&#x27;s facility, initially known as Risdon Women&#x27;s Prison, is now called the Mary Hutchinson Women&#x27;s Prison.

In 1974, a low security unit, later called the Ron Barwick Medium Security Prison, was opened, accommodating 120 inmates at its peak. By 1981, declining numbers resulted in closure of the unit. The minimum security was re-opened in 1991 and closed again in 1997 on the grounds of economic viability. The medium security facility opened again, and closed in 2004 as part of the redevelopment of the whole complex. In 2007, the facility was reopened as a minimum security centre.

A special prison hospital was built in 1978, that houses persons suffering mental illness who are subject to the criminal justice system.

==Facilities==

===Maximum security===
Opened in November 1960 as Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Risdon, the 349–cell maximum security prison was widely considered the most advanced prison in Australia. Critics have called the design, which embodies concepts in prison architecture from the U.S., several decades out of date and unsuitable for Tasmania&#x27;s temperate climate, particularly in winter. The architect was Brian B. Lewis of the University of Melbourne.

All prisoners were accommodated in single occupancy cells containing a toilet and hand basin with running water. Heating was also provided in the cells together with access to local radio stations on headphones. During construction, inmate populations increased, and Lewis&#x27;s original plans were changed by adding 72 additional cells, halving the space devoted to exercise yards. None of the other prison facilities, such as workshops and recreation space, were enlarged to allow for the increased capacity.

The complex houses maximum security inmates within its Derwent, Huon, Franklin and Tamar units. With the exception of Tamar, mainstream maximum-security units each have 26 beds, mostly single bed cells but with several two-bed &quot;buddy&quot; cells. The cells are located over two storeys around a common &quot;day&quot; area including lounge and dining facilities. Cells are equipped with a shower, toilet, bed, writing desk and television. Access is available to an attached, mesh-enclosed, exercise yard. The maximum-security part of the campus also includes needs assessment, protection, crisis support, detention and behaviour management units, with layouts similar to the mainstream units.

The behaviour management unit, called Tamar, is an 8-cell high security unit used to house prisoners who are considered to pose a particularly high risk to correctional staff, to other prisoners or detainees, or to the maintenance of good order and security in the prison.

===Wilfred Lopes Centre for Forensic Mental Health===
In 2006, the Wilfred Lopes Centre for Forensic Mental Health replaced the Risdon Prison Hospital. The prison hospital was located within the grounds of the old H.M. Risdon Prison and had 28 single cells that provided medical assessment on reception, outpatient care, inpatient care, and inpatient psychiatric care.

The Wilfred Lopes Centre is situated near the Risdon Prison Complex, but is not part of the prison. It is a health facility owned and managed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Patients are provided with specialised psychiatric care and treatment. Treatment is based on individually tailored programs designed to support independence and dignity, and minimise the ill effects of long-term care. The 35-bed unit caters for the varying needs of clients, including a mix of males and females. The grounds are landscaped to help create a therapeutic environment. The Centre includes 12 beds in a high-dependency unit, for people with acute illness; 18 beds in an extended care unit, for people who require a less restrictive environment and are able to participate in rehabilitation activities; and 5 beds in a semi-independent living unit for people preparing for discharge into the community. There is also a 3-bed de-escalation suite with three seclusion rooms, lounge and courtyard (not counted as part of bed-numbers).

===Medium security===
Located outside the perimeter of the maximum security prison, the Ron Barwick Medium Security Prison contained thirty six cells and an indoor recreation area. This facility operated an incentive for inmates of the maximum security prison to strive to achieve a medium security classification in order that they may be transferred to the better conditions in the Ron Barwick Prison. The facility has opened and closed on several occasions since it first opened in 1974. The facility was demolished in 2004 to make way for the new prison. In 2006, the old H.M. Risdon Prison was renamed as Ron Barwick Minimum Security prison, even though is it classified as a medium security environment. Medium security inmates are housed in units of either 6 or 8 beds. Each unit has individual bedrooms, along with a two-bed &quot;buddy&quot; room, and common lounge, dining, toilet and shower facilities. Inmates have access to a majority of the outdoor grounds in the medium security part of the complex.

==Inquiries into facilities==
In 1999, a Tasmanian Parliament Committee reported that the number of cells far exceeded any likely requirements at the time of construction or since. The Committee reported that the Corrective Services Division advised that between 1992 and 1997 the entire prison system had an average of between a total of 250 and 300 inmates spread through all the facilities. The Committee reported that the facility is &quot;fundamentally inappropriate&quot;:
It operates as a series of cages and cells which open to exposed yards. It is devoid of any of the normal features of a dwelling or residential facility. The only institution in our society with which this facility could be closely compared is a zoo. It would be difficult to design an institution which would be more calculated to promote an alienated sub-culture, entirely inconsistent with desirable normal social behaviour and values.
A 2001 report by the Tasmanian Ombudsman stated:
No prison is a pleasant place, but the Risdon Prison is a particularly unpleasant place. It is bleak, cold and grey and, even if a very large amount of money were to be spent on the facility, it is unlikely that it could ever conform to contemporary prison standards. The buildings reflect years of relative neglect by successive governments and even when it was built, forty years ago, the Prison would have been out of date and totally inappropriate in its design for the rigours of a Tasmanian winter. Moreover, it was built as a Maximum Security Prison and remains so, even though the demand has never been for a full maximum security facility. When additional stresses, such as an unexpected surge in prisoner numbers or a significant change in the nature of the prisoner population occur, as has happened at Risdon, there is an inevitable strain on resources and management. Staff morale drops, inmate unrest and dissatisfaction escalate and the system begins to crack. This is what had happened at Risdon, and had been happening for a significant period of time prior to the investigation.

The Ombudsman&#x27;s Report follows a coronial inquiry into five deaths in custody that occurred between August 1999 and January 2000. In March 2011 the Coroner found that in four of the five cases, management of the complex:
...failed to provide a physical environment which would minimise the risk of self harm and a system of care which would recognise a vulnerability to suicide and actively promote steps to prevent it.

The Ombudsman reported again, this time in 2010, when he initiated an investigation of his own accord following receipts of a number of complaints during 2007 and 2008 which made him concerned about the conditions under which the prisoners in the high risk management unit, called Tamar, were being held. In his report, the Ombudsman commented that:
I was concerned that the conditions in Tamar might not be humane.
Further, he found:
that there is no formal practice for informing prisoners of the reasons for their placement in the unit, and that the management of the unit does not comply with national or international standards in this regard.
that prisoners are not adequately informed about the rules and conditions which apply to them in the unit, and that this is not compliant with national standards.
that prisoners have been held in the unit for indeterminate periods of time, on the basis of perceived dangerousness, and that this is incompatible with national standards and standards observed in other jurisdictions.
that the BMP [Behavioural Management Program] has not always been applied consistently and objectively.
that the monthly reviews of a prisoner&#x27;s performance under the BMP are not carried out with procedural fairness, in that prisoners are not notified in advance of any perceived problem with their behaviour, are not therefore given a fair opportunity to respond, and are not given prior warning of a proposed sanction. There have even been cases of reviews without the prisoner being present.
that not only are prisoners in the unit locked down in solitary confinement for most of the time, but they have nothing constructive to do, since no programs or industry activities are available to them. The principal distraction is television. This circumstance is not humane, and does not meet standards adopted in the United Kingdom or standards promulgated by the Inspector of Custodial Services in WA, which in my view are indicative of proper practice.

In 2010, Mick Palmer, a former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, was requested by the Minister for Corrections and Consumer Protection, Nick McKim to undertake an inquiry into the Risdon Prison Complex, with the intention of providing the Government of Tasmania with impartial, objective and accurate advice on the complex&#x27;s operations. Amongst his findings and recommendations, in 2011 Palmer commented that:
...there is currently a lack of clear and decisive leadership within the TPS [Tasmanian Prison Service] and RPC [Risdon Prison Complex]. Further, there is a high level of distrust between management and staff, where operational practices have served to cause staff to withdraw from interaction with prisoners, compounding into excessive lockdowns (particularly of maximum security rated prisoners) and, overall, to apply what can only be described as little more than containment policy across the prison as a whole.
One of the outcomes of the Palmer Report was the employment of a prison administrator and a prison inspector to help rid the prison of serious cultural problems.

==Controversies==
In 1967, a fire started by prisoners had almost destroyed the workshop complex. The building had used a great deal of timber in its construction and no fire protection system had been installed. It was rebuilt with prison labour at a cost of A$300,000.

During a four-month period in 1999 and 2000, five men died while imprisoned at Risdon. An investigative media report by the ABC &quot;Four Corners&quot; program highlighted that there have been at least 18 deaths in custody at Risdon in 12 years, the findings of the coronial inquiry, and the failure of successive governments to address problems at the centre.

During the 2001 coronial inquiry, it was recommended that young inmates should not be housed with sex offenders. In spite of this recommendation, in 2004 it was reported that young inmates were often sharing accommodation and shower facilities with convicted child sex offenders.

On 7 May 2005, male prisoners took prison officer Kenneth Hannah and several other inmates hostage to protest against poor conditions, demanding the resignation of Tasmanian Attorney-General Judy Jackson and the public servant in charge of prisons. The siege ended on 9 May 2005.

On 16 April 2006, Easter Sunday, prisoners took keys from a female prison officer and a 20-hour siege ensued, ending the next day. The ostensible reason for the action was the quality of food served to inmates.

Some within the community argue that the current facility, programs and management of prisoners are actually counter productive in promoting rehabilitation of criminals or reducing crime.

In 2015, Robin Michael, a health official took his own life in the jail. He had allegedly murdered his wife a few days earlier.

<doc id="1186503" wikidata="Q3155371" url="?curid=1186503" title="Islam in Oman">
<text>Islam is the state religion in Oman, introduced during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime in the early 7th century. Muhammad appointed Amr ibn al-As as governor, who remained until Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632 CE. Amr and Sa&#x27;id ibn Aws al-Ansari delivered Muhammad&#x27;s letter to the Al-Julanda brothers; the rulers of Oman, inviting them to embrace Islam. This peaceful mission marked the beginning of Islam in Oman. Today, 95.9% of Oman&#x27;s population is Muslim, with slightly over 45% following Sunni Islam, and around 45% Ibadi Islam, with the other 5% identifying as Shia Muslims.

== History ==
Islam spread peacefully in Oman during the early 7th century, initiated by Prophet Muhammad. Oman initially followed Sunni Islam influenced by the teachings of Amr ibn al-As. The Ibaadi denomination, a branch of the Khawarij, later established itself in Oman after fleeing Basra in modern-day Iraq. The first Ibaadi state was established in Oman in 750 CE during the transitional period following the fall of the Umayyed Caliphate but fell to the Abbasid Caliphate in 752 CE. Another Ibadi state emerged in 793 CE, lasting until the Abbasid recapture in 893 CE. Subsequent centuries saw the re-establishment of Ibadi imamates in the modern era, and Ibadis remain in Oman, including the royal family. The current monarchy, which overthrew the Ibadi imamate, is also Ibadi.

==Denominations==
=== Sunnism ===
Sunni Islam is practiced by slightly over 45% of Oman&#x27;s Muslim population. The Sunni communities in Oman are predominantly located south of the Al-Hajar mountain chain and in certain coastal areas. These regions have largely retained their Sunni practices from the time of Amr ibn al-As. Sunni Islam in Oman includes various schools of thought, with the Shafi&#x27;i school being particularly prominent in the southern region of Al Wusta &amp; Dhofar, while the Hanbali school of thought is more prominent in the northern areas. The increase in the Sunni Muslim population is also helped by migrants from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Despite covering a large geographical area, the number of Omani Sunnis is relatively few compared to the Ibadis.

=== Ibadism ===

==== Introduction to Oman ====
Ibadism, named after its founder Abdallah ibn Ibad, a major head of the Khawarij, traces its roots back to the early Kharijite movement. This sect emerged after the Battle of Siffin in 657 CE. Arriving in Oman around 700 CE, the Ibadis were initially part of the Kharijite group but gradually distinguished themselves by adopting more moderate views compared to other Kharijite factions.

==== Settlement and Expansion in Oman ====
After the death of Abdallah ibn Ibad of Banu Tamim in 700 CE, the Ibadis scattered, with some settling in Oman and others in parts of the Maghreb al-Arabi (Northwest Africa). In Oman, they found a conducive environment for their beliefs among the local tribes who were receptive to their message of piety and egalitarianism. By 750 CE, the Ibadis established their first state in Oman, although it was short-lived and fell to the Abbasid Caliphate in 752 CE.

Despite this setback, the Ibadis continued to grow in influence by forming alliances with local tribes and promoting the idea that they were the true representatives of the Omani people, in contrast to the Abbasids who they deemed as foreign oppressors. In 793 CE, another Ibadi state emerged in Oman, lasting until the Abbasid recapture in 893 CE. Even after the Abbasid reconquests, Ibadi imams maintained considerable power and influence in the region. Over subsequent centuries, Ibadism became deeply entrenched in Omani society, leading to the re-establishment of Ibadi imamates in the late modern period.

==== How Ibadis Became the Ruling Sect ====
The Ibadis managed to become the ruling sect in Oman despite not being the majority initially due to their strong organizational structure and ability to mobilize the local tribes. They skillfully portrayed the Abbasids as foreign oppressors and themselves as the indigenous defenders of Omani identity and autonomy. This narrative resonated with many Omanis, allowing the Ibadis to gain significant support. Over time, they established a series of imamate systems, where the imam held both religious and political authority. However, the persistent power of the Ibadi imamate was challenged in the mid-20th century. The conflict culminated in the Jebel Akhdar War (1954-1959), where the Sultanate of Muscat, aided by British forces, fought against the Ibadi imamate. The war ended with the defeat of the imamate and solidified the Sultanate&#x27;s control over the entire country. This victory marked the end of the Ibadi imamate as a political entity and paved the way for the current Omani monarchy, which emerged from these historical roots.

==== Modern Ibadi Reform under the Sultanate ====
Under the current Omani sultanate, Ibadism has undergone significant reforms to adapt to the changing political and social landscape. The establishment of the Sultanate of Oman in the mid-18th century marked a pivotal shift from the traditional Ibadi imamate system to a hereditary monarchy. This transition was significantly influenced by internal conflicts and external support, particularly from the British.

The reforms done under Ahmed bin Hamad al-Khalili, the Ibadi&#x27;s Grand Mufti, have been crucial in shaping contemporary Ibadi practice. Al-Khalili endorsed the hereditary monarchy, moving away from the traditional election of imams based on merit and piety. This shift was part of broader efforts to modernize the state and integrate Ibadism within the framework of a modern nation-state.

Religious tolerance has been another hallmark of these reforms. The Sultanate promotes an inclusive approach, allowing various religious communities to practice their faith openly. This approach contrasts with the historical Ibadi practice of Bara&#x27;ah, which involved disassociating from those considered sinful or deviant, including some companions of the Prophet Muhammad, particularly Uthman ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib. Historically, Ibadi texts have criticized and denounced these figures. However, under al-Khalili&#x27;s influence, there has been a significant softening of these views, fostering a more inclusive religious environment in Oman. This reform has helped bridge the divide between different Muslim sects and other religious communities, promoting a sense of unity and coexistence within the country.

==== Differences from mainstream Islam (Sunni) ====

===== Theological Foundations =====

* Election of imams: Unlike Sunni Islam, which accepts dynastic succession and hereditary leadership in some cases, Ibadis traditionally believe in electing imams based on merit and piety. However, the current Ibadi leadership in Oman has adopted a hereditary monarchy system.
* Views on leadership: Ibadis reject the Sunni notion of a hereditary caliphate, emphasizing the election of leaders through a consultative process. This principle has shifted in contemporary Oman under the monarchy.

===== Religious Practices =====

* Interpretation of divine attributes: Unlike Sunnis, who believe that God&#x27;s attributes are unique but real, Ibadis and Mu&#x27;tazilites deny the literal existence of these attributes.
* Created nature of the Quran: Ibadis believe that God&#x27;s speech is created, contrasting with the Sunni belief in the uncreated nature of God&#x27;s speech.

===== Social and Ethical Principles =====

* Walayah and Bara&#x27;ah: Ibadis adhere to the principles of Walayah (affiliation) and Bara&#x27;ah (disassociation), dictating social and religious interactions. This includes disassociating from those deemed sinful or deviant, a practice also emphasized in Sunni Islam.
* Kufr al-Ni&#x27;mah (disbelievers of grace): Ibadis classify major sinners as &quot;Kufr al-Ni&#x27;mah,&quot; or disbelievers of grace. This means that while such individuals are considered Muslims and retain their rights as fellow Muslims, they are believed to be eternally condemned to hell in the hereafter albeit they do not repent prior to their death.

===== Eschatological Views =====

* Seeing God in the afterlife: Ibadis deny seeing of God in the afterlife, a belief shared with the Shia but differing from the Sunni perspective.
* Interpretation of Judgment Day concepts: Ibadis interpret the concepts of the Scale of Deeds (Meezaan) and the Bridge (Siraat) on the Day of Judgment metaphorically rather than literal.

These differences highlight the unique characteristics of Ibadism compared to Sunni Islam, shaping the religious and social landscape of Oman.

===Shi&#x27;ism===
Shi&#x27;ism constitutes a minority within the Omani Muslim population, predominantly following the Twelver branch. Shiite communities are mainly located along the Al Batinah coast and in Muscat. Al-Lawatia, a prominent Shiite tribe, have Persian origins and have been significant in trade and commerce. Despite their minority status, they practice their faith openly, commemorating events like Ashura. The Omani government&#x27;s policy of religious tolerance has fostered coexistence and inclusion, allowing Shiites to contribute significantly to Oman&#x27;s cultural and economic development.

<text>HM Prison Won Wron was a minimum security prison located at Won Wron near Yarram in Victoria.

In 1962/63, a group of prisoners and prison officers from HM Prison Morwell River began construction of the HM Prison Won Wron.

The facility was associated with a Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) nursery to raise pine seedlings for the Strzelecki Ranges reforestation scheme, although no prison labour was available for forests work until 1968.

Eucalypt seedlings were produced at a similar FCV nursery at Olsens Bridge near Boolara which was associated with HM Prison Morwell River. The Olsens Bridge nursery operated until 1991 when operations transferred to Won Wron.

Soon after in 1993, the Victorian Plantations Corporation was formed and transferred its nursery operations to an expanded facility at nearby Gelliondale. 

The Prison was noteworthy in that it held an annual fun-run on Easter Sunday with the tongue-in-cheek name of &quot;Prisoners on the Run&quot;, which raised funds to help support disabled and disadvantaged children in the Gippsland area.

HM Prison Won Wron closed in late 2004 and the subsequent proposal to set up an Indigenous rehabilitation facility on the site was opposed by the local community of Yarram.

The site reopened in 2008 as the Wulgunggo Ngalu Learning Place, a culturally appropriate learning place that houses and supports up to 18 Koori men who are undertaking Community Correction Orders. It won the community corrections category of the 2010 International Corrections and Prisons Association (ICPA) awards.
