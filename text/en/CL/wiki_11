<text>Norman Allan Miller (born 1956) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka for the Progressive Conservative Party from 2001 to 2022. His father, Frank Miller, was also a Progressive Conservative MPP from the region for 11 years, and briefly served as Premier of Ontario in 1985.

==Background==
Miller started a Muskoka Young Progressive Conservative organization in 1975, and has been active in the party since this time. He is a commercial pilot and has served as president of Muskoka Tourism.

Miller along with his wife Chris, and their children Abigail, Renne, Winston and Stuart owned and operated a lodge called Patterson Kaye between the 1980s until 2005.

==Politics==
Miller was elected to the Ontario legislature in a 2001 by-election, called after Ernie Eves resigned his seat in the legislature; he defeated Liberal Evelyn Brown by about 4000 votes. In April 2002, Miller was appointed as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Northern Development and Mines.

Miller was re-elected by an increased margin in the 2003 provincial election, although the Progressive Conservatives were reduced to only 24 out of 103 seats in the legislature as the Liberals won a commanding majority. In 2004, he supported John Tory in the latter&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Eves as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.

He was re-elected in 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2018.

<text>A microfilmer is a machine used by the document management industry to create microfilm. These machines are also often called &quot;imagers&quot; in the industry. A microfilmer is a camera that is used to photograph documents to create a more compact and permanent record of the original in the form of roll-film or microfiche. Once the information contained on a paper document has been recorded onto microfilm, the information can be viewed later on a microfilm reader or viewer, or reproduced in paper form on a microfilm reader-printer.

Banking and insurance companies often convert their paper records using microfilmers. Libraries often keep newspapers and magazines which have been converted to roll-film or microfiche form using microfilmers. Microfilmers are often used to preserve government records. Many companies have switched from microfilm to digital imaging systems, which offer more convenient computer retrieval of records.

Microfilmers come in two basic configurations: planetary and rotary. A planetary microfilmer takes a snapshot of a stationary document held on a flat surface. While the picture is being taken, the film and the document do not move. In a rotary microfilmer, both the document and the film are moving in sync with one another while the picture is being taken. This allows for quicker filming of the document. Planetary microfilmers typically offer higher image resolution than rotary filmers, and can more readily film larger documents, as well as odd-shaped documents, such as books.

In the 1951 film When Worlds Collide, a roomful of planetary filmers and their operators are shown as they race against time to preserve crucial books for survivors of a doomed Earth. </text><links>

<doc id="1156685" wikidata="Q3487489" url="?curid=1156685" title="The Paradise Syndrome">
<text>&quot;The Paradise Syndrome&quot; is the third episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Margaret Armen and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast October 4, 1968.

In the episode, an alien device on a primitive planet erases Captain Kirk&#x27;s memory, and he begins a new life with the planet&#x27;s indigenous people modeled on Native Americans.

==Plot==
Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy transport to the surface of an Earth-like planet, from which they are to deflect an approaching asteroid. They discover an obelisk with strange markings, and observe a settlement whose inhabitants, according to Spock, are descended from Native Americans (Mohican, Navaho and Delaware). Kirk, while out of sight of the others, falls through a trap door into the obelisk, where a beam shocks him into unconsciousness. Spock and McCoy are unable to locate Kirk and return to the Federation starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; to complete their mission.

Kirk awakens with amnesia, and a pair of women, including Miramanee, the tribal priestess, see Kirk emerge from their &quot;temple.&quot; He is hailed as a god, and taken back to their village, where the tribal elders demand proof of Kirk&#x27;s divinity. At that moment, a drowned boy is brought in. Salish, the medicine chief, declares the child dead, but Kirk uses mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to revive him. The elders accept Kirk as a god, forcing Salish to relinquish his position to Kirk.

In the meantime Spock, taking command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, drives her at maximum warp speed to beat the approaching asteroid to the deflection point. However, having pushed the engines well beyond their normal limits, there is not much energy left to deflect the asteroid. The ship&#x27;s deflectors result in a change of only 0.0013 degrees in its course, which Mr. Sulu tells Spock is insufficient to avert collision with the planet. An attempt to cleave the asteroid like a diamond using the ship&#x27;s phasers fails, and the attempt damages the warp drive beyond Scotty&#x27;s ability to repair. Having exhausted their options, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; heads back to the planet on impulse power to attempt to recover Captain Kirk and devise another solution to the asteroid problem. The trip will take 59 days and according to Mr. Spock, &quot;that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way.&quot;

Following the tradition that the tribe priestess and medicine chief marry, Miramanee rejects Salish for Kirk. Kirk falls deeper in love with Miramanee, though haunted at night by dreams of people he feels he should be with. Miramanee happily tells Kirk that she is pregnant.

As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; nears the planet, Spock succeeds in partially deciphering the markings on the obelisk. It is an asteroid deflector built by the &quot;Preservers&quot;, an ancient race that resettled various endangered humanoid populations on other planets in order to ensure their survival. Spock surmises that the deflector has malfunctioned.

As the asteroid nears the planet, the sky darkens, thunder roars, and strong winds blow. The elders tell Kirk he must go into the temple to stop the storm. As Kirk pounds fruitlessly on the side of the obelisk, demanding that it open for him, the tribe turns against him. They begin stoning him and Miramanee. Spock and McCoy materialize, frightening the villagers away. Spock uses a mind meld to retrieve Kirk&#x27;s memories, while McCoy tends to Miramanee&#x27;s wounds. Kirk is able to open the trap door into the &quot;temple&quot; by speaking the correct tones to open it, and Spock activates the deflector with minutes to spare. McCoy tells Kirk that Miramanee will not survive. She dies in his arms, and he grieves.

==Production==
Paramount Television daily production reports record that this episode was filmed on Paramount’s Gower stages on June 11, 17 and 18, 1968, and at the Upper Franklin Canyon Reservoir, California, for the planet scenes on June 12–14, 1968.

==Reception==

Author Jon Davidson on his sci-fi tv and movie website rated this episode 7 out of 10, noting &quot;while the presence of Native Americans on yet another parallel Earth planet is only briefly explained, &quot;The Paradise Syndrome&quot; provides a compelling romance subplot to compensate for any questionable science fiction aspects.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine suggested this episode was skippable in their binge-watching guide for the original series.

In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated the love story between Kirk and Miramanee as the sixth best love story in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;Nerdist&quot; included this episode on their &quot;Best of Kirk&quot; binge-watching guide.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked The Paradise Syndrome at number 74 out of the 79 original series episodes. 

== Releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン 

This episode was included in TOS Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<doc id="1156686" wikidata="Q606014" url="?curid=1156686" title="Narayana Pandita (mathematician)">
<text>Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita () (1340–1400) was an Indian mathematician. Plofker writes that his texts were the most significant Sanskrit mathematics treatises after those of Bhaskara II, other than the Kerala school. He wrote the &quot;Ganita Kaumudi&quot; (lit. &quot;Moonlight of mathematics&quot;) in 1356 about mathematical operations. The work anticipated many developments in combinatorics.

==Life and Works==
About his life, the most that is known is that:
Narayana Pandit wrote two works, an arithmetical treatise called &quot;Ganita Kaumudi&quot; and an algebraic treatise called &quot;Bijaganita Vatamsa&quot;. Narayana is also thought to be the author of an elaborate commentary of Bhaskara II&#x27;s Lilavati, titled &quot;Karmapradipika&quot; (or &quot;Karma-Paddhati&quot;). Although the &quot;Karmapradipika&quot; contains little original work, it contains seven different methods for squaring numbers, a contribution that is wholly original to the author, as well as contributions to algebra and magic squares.

Narayana&#x27;s other major works contain a variety of mathematical developments, including a rule to calculate approximate values of square roots, investigations into the second order indeterminate equation &quot;nq&quot;2 + 1 = &quot;p&quot;2 (Pell&#x27;s equation), solutions of indeterminate higher-order equations, mathematical operations with zero, several geometrical rules, methods of integer factorization, and a discussion of magic squares and similar figures. Narayana has also made contributions to the topic of cyclic quadrilaterals.
Narayana is also credited with developing a method for systematic generation of all permutations of a given sequence.

==Narayana&#x27;s cows sequence==
In his &quot;Ganita Kaumudi&quot; Narayana proposed the following problem on a herd of cows and calves:

Translated into the modern mathematical language of recurrence sequences:
: for ,
with initial values

The first few terms are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28, 41, 60, 88... .
The limit ratio between consecutive terms is the supergolden ratio.

The definition of the sequence and the supergolden ratio are closely related to the definitions of the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden ratio.

<doc id="1156687" wikidata="Q177059" url="?curid=1156687" title="Hakuin Ekaku">
<text>was one of the most influential figures in Japanese Zen Buddhism, who regarded bodhicitta, working for the benefit of others, as the ultimate concern of Zen-training. While never having received formal dharma transmission, he is regarded as the reviver of the Japanese Rinzai school from a period of stagnation, focusing on rigorous training methods integrating meditation and koan practice.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of Hara, at the foot of Mount Fuji. His mother was a devout Nichiren Buddhist, and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist monk. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the Eight Hot Hells. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of hell, seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk.

====Shōin-ji and Daishō-ji====
At the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, Shōin-ji, by the residing priest Tanrei Soden. Tanrei had a poor health, and Hakuin was soon sent to a neighboring temple, Daishō-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the Lotus Sutra, considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying &quot;it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about cause and effect&quot;.

====Zensō-ji====
At age eighteen, he left Daishō-ji for Zensō-ji, a temple close to Hara. At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the Chinese Ch&#x27;an master Yantou Quanhuo, who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.

====Zuiun-ji====
Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher. While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the Dharma to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the Ming Dynasty. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.

===First awakening===

====Eigen-ji====
He again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into enlightenment when he was twenty-four. He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple.

====Shōju Rōjin====
Hakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Shōju Rōjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721), an enigmatic teacher whose historicity has been questioned. According to Hakuin and his biographers, Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Shōju replied &quot;You&#x27;re a self-centered rascal, aren&#x27;t you!&quot; Shōju assigned him a series of &quot;hard-to-pass&quot; koans. These led to three isolated moments of satori, but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Shōju meant with this.

Hakuin left Shoju after eight months of study, but in later life, when he had realized Shoju&#x27;s teachings on the importance of bodhicitta, Hakuin considered Shoju Rojin his primary teacher, and solidly identified himself with Shoju&#x27;s dharma-lineage. Today Hakuin is considered to have received dharma transmission from Shoju, though he didn&#x27;t receive formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin, nor from any other teacher, a contradiction for the Rinzai&#x27;s school emphasis on formal dharma-transmission.

====Incomplete accomplishment and renewed doubt====
Hakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete. His insight was sharp during meditation, but he was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life. His mental dispositions were unchanged, and attachment and aversion still prevailed in daily life, a tendency which he could not correct through &quot;ordinary intellectual means.&quot; His mental anguish even worsened when, at twenty-six, he read that &quot;all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi-mind fall into Hell&quot;. This raised a &quot;great doubt&quot; (&quot;taigi&quot;) in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind. Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what &quot;bodhi-mind&quot; means, namely working for the good of others.

====Zen sickness====
Hakuin&#x27;s early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a nervous breakdown by Western medicine. He called it Zen sickness, and in later life often narrated to have sought the advice of a Taoist cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a visualization (the &#x27;soft butter method&#x27;) and breathing practice (&#x27;introspective meditation&#x27;, using abdominal breathing and focussing on the hara), which eventually relieved his symptoms. From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue. The practices Hakuin claimed to have learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.

===Temple priest at Shōin-ji===
After another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century, giving Torin Sosho, who had followed-up Tanrei, as his &quot;master&quot; when enscribing himself in the Mioshi-ji bureaucracy. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of &quot;Dai-ichiza&quot;, &quot;First Monk&quot;:
It was around this time that he adopted the name &quot;Hakuin&quot;, which means &quot;concealed in white&quot;, referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji.

====Final awakening====
Although Hakuin had several &quot;satori experiences&quot;, he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life. While eventually admitting a small number of students, Hakuin committed himself to a thorough practice, sitting all night in zazen. At age 41, he experienced a decisive awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the sutra that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the Bodhi-mind means working for the good of every sentient being:
He wrote of this experience, saying &quot;suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus&quot;. This event marked a turning point in Hakuin&#x27;s life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation.

====Practicing the bodhi-mind====

He would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin&#x27;s students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors.

====Is that so?====
A well-known anecdote took place in this period:
===Death===
Shortly before his death, Hakuin wrote
Written over a large calligraphic character 死 &quot;shi&quot;, meaning Death, he had written as his &quot;jisei&quot; (death poem):

At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.

==Teachings==
Like his predecessors Shidō Bu&#x27;nan (Munan) (1603–1676) and Dōkyō Etan (Shoju Rojin, &quot;The Old Man of Shōju Hermitage&quot;) (1642–1721), Hakuin stressed the importance of &quot;kensho&quot; and post-satori practice, deepening one&#x27;s understanding and working for the benefit of others. Just like them he was critical of the state of practice in the Rinzai-establishment, which he saw as lacking in rigorous training.

===Post-satori practice===
Hakuin saw &quot;deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere&quot; as an indispensable part of the Buddhist path to awakening. Hakuin emphasized the need for &quot;post-satori training&quot;, purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and 
The insight in the need of arousing bodhicitta formed Hakuin&#x27;s final awakening:
===Koan practice===

====Koan-training====
Hakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive meditation on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and doubt that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the &quot;great doubt&quot;, writing, &quot;At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully&quot;.

Hakuin used two or three stages in his application of koan-training. Students had to develop their ability to see (&quot;kensho&quot;) their true nature. Yet, they also had to sustain the &quot;great doubt&quot;, going beyond their initial awakening and further deepen their insight struggling with &quot;difficult-to-pass&quot; (&quot;nanto&quot;) &quot;koans&quot;, which Hakuin seems to have inherited from his teachers. This further training and awakening culminates in a full integration of understanding and quietude with the action of daily life, and &quot;bodhicitta&quot;, upholding the four bodhisattva-vows and striving to liberate all living beings.

====Hear the sound of one hand====
In later life he used the instruction &quot;Hear the sound of one hand,&quot; which actually consists of two parts, to raise the great doubt with beginners. He first mentioned it when writing 
&quot;Kannon Bosatsu&quot; is Kanzeon (&quot;Avalokiteshvara&quot;, &quot;Guanyin&quot;), the bodhisattva of great compassion, who hears the sounds of all people suffering in this world. The second part is &quot;Put a stop all sounds,&quot; referring to the first bodhisattva vow of liberating all sentient beings.

Hakuin preferred this to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the Mu koan. He believed his &quot;Sound of One Hand&quot; to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that &quot;its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud&quot;.

While &#x27;the sound of one hand&#x27; is the classical instruction used by Hakuin, in &quot;Hakuin on kensho&quot; and other writings he emphasises the Hua Tou-like question &quot;Who is the host of seeing and hearing?&quot; to arouse the great doubt, akin to Bassui Tokushō&#x27;s (1327–1387) &quot;Who is hearing this sound?&quot;, and the Ōbaku use of the &quot;nembutsu kōan&quot;, which entailed the practice of reciting the name of Amitabha while holding in one&#x27;s mind the kōan, &quot;Who is reciting?&quot; Bassui equates Buddha-nature or the One Mind with Kanzeon, compassion. &quot;...someone who, for every sound he heard, contemplated the mind of the hearer, thereby realizing his true nature.&quot; Bassui further explains that &quot;The one gate the so-called one who hears the Dharma [...] was the perfection achieved by the bodhisattva Kannon.&quot;

As for antecedents of &#x27;the sound of one hand&#x27;, it &quot;has a close relation to,&quot; or is &quot;adapted from,&quot; Xuedou Chongxian&#x27;s (980-1052) poetic commentary that &quot;a single hand by itself produces no sound,&quot; which appears in case 18 of &quot;The Blue Cliff Record&quot;. One hand also appears in some interactions and explanations. When first meeting Shōju Rōjin, Hakuin
The &quot;Recorded Sayings&quot; of Zhaozhou Congshen (Jōshū Jūshin, 778–897) contain the following episode:
Regarding his final awakening, in his biography &quot;Wild Ivy&quot; Hakuin wrote
===Four ways of knowing===
Asanga, one of the main proponents of Yogacara, introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the Eight Consciousnesses: 
# The five senses are connected to the perfection of action,
# Samjna (cognition) is connected to observing knowing,
# Manas (mind) is related to universal knowing,
# Alaya-vijnana is connected to great mirror knowing.
In time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha (Dharmakāya, Sambhogakāya and Nirmanakaya), together forming the &quot;Yuishiki doctrine&quot;.

Hakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana.
# The Gate of Inspiration is initial awakening, kensho, seeing into one&#x27;s true nature.
# The Gate of Practice is the purification of oneself by continuous practice.
# The Gate of Awakening is the study of the ancient masters and the Buddhist sutras, to deepen the insight into the Buddhist teachings, and acquire the skills needed to help other sentient beings on the Buddhist path to awakening.
# The Gate of Nirvana is the &quot;ultimate liberation&quot;, &quot;knowing without any kind of defilement&quot;.

===The Five Ranks===
Hakuin found the study and understanding of Dongshan Liangjie&#x27;s (Jp. Tōzan Ryōkan) Five Ranks highly useful in post-satori practice. Today, they form part of the 5th step of the Japanese Rinzai koan-curriculum.

===Opposition to &quot;Do-nothing Zen&quot;===
One of Hakuin&#x27;s major concerns was the danger of what he called &quot;Do-nothing Zen&quot; teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, &quot;passing day after day in a state of seated sleep&quot;. Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil &quot;emptiness&quot; was enlightenment, were Hakuin&#x27;s constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of followers of the maverick Zen master Bankei. He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of &quot;satori&quot; and forge one&#x27;s ability to manifest it in all activities. He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.

===Zen-sickness and vital energy===
In several of his writings, most notably &quot;Yasenkanna&quot; (&quot;Idle Talk on a Night Boat&quot;) Hakuin describes how he cured his Zen-sickness (&quot;zenbyō&quot;) by using two methods explained to him by Hakuyū, a Taoist cave-dwelling hermit. These methods are &#x27;introspective meditation&#x27;, a contemplation practice called &quot;naikan&quot; using abdominal breathing and focussing on the hara, and a visualization, the &#x27;soft butter method&#x27;.

According to Katō Shǒshun, this zen-sickness most likely happened when Hakuin was in his late twenties. Shǒshun conjects that these remedies were worked out by Hakuin on his own, from &quot;a combination of traditional medical and meditation texts and folk therapies current at the time.&quot; According to Waddell, &quot;Yasenkanna&quot; has been in print ever since it was published, reflecting its popularity in secular circles.

In the preface to &quot;Yasenkanna&quot;, attributed by Hakuin to a disciple called &quot;Hunger and Cold, the Master of Poverty Hermitage,&quot; Hakuin explains that a long life can be attained by disciplining the body through gathering the &quot;ki&quot;, the life-force or &quot;the fire or heat in your mind (heart),&quot; in the &quot;tanden&quot; or lower belly, producing &quot;the true elixir&quot; (&quot;shintan&quot;), which is &quot;not something located apart from the self.&quot; He describes a four-step contemplation to concentrate the &quot;ki&quot; in the &quot;tanden&quot;, as a cure against zen-sickness. In the &quot;naikan&quot; method, as explained by &quot;the master,&quot; the practitioner lays down on his back, and concentrates the &quot;ki&quot; in the &quot;tanden&quot;, using the following contemplations:
This method is different from the &#x27;soft butter&#x27; method, and, according to Waddell, closer to traditional Zen-practice. Hakuin himself warns that longevity is not the goal of Buddhism, and is incomparable to following the Bodhisattva vows, &quot;constantly working to impart the great Dharma to others as you acquire the imposing comportment of the Bodhisattva.&quot;

In the main text of the &quot;Yasenkanna&quot; Hakuin lets Hakuyū give an extensive explanation on the principles of Chinese medicine and the dictum of &quot;bringing the heart down into your lower body,&quot; without giving concrete instructions for practice. Hakuin has Hakuyū further explain that &quot;false meditation is meditation that is diverse and unfocused,&quot; while &quot;true meditation is no-meditation.&quot; Hakuyū then comes with a series of quotations and references from Buddhist sources. In passing, Hakuyū refers to &quot;a method in the Agama in which butter is used.&quot; On Hakuin&#x27;s request, Hakuyū then sets out to explain the &#x27;butter method&#x27;. In this method, one visualizes a lump of soft butter on the head, which slowly melts, relaxing the body as it spreads over all parts of it.

==Influence==

===Emphasis on &quot;kensho&quot; and post-satori practice===
Hakuin put a strong emphasis on &quot;kensho&quot; and post-satori practice, following the examples of his dharma-predecessors Gudō Toshoku (1577–1661), Shidō Bu&#x27;nan (Munan)(1603–1676), and his own teacher Shoju Rojin (Dokyu Etan), 1642–1721). The emphasis on &quot;kensho&quot; had a strong influence on western perceptions of Zen through the writings of D.T. Suzuki and the practice-style of Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, though the Sanbo Kyodan has also incorporated the necessity of post-satori practice.

===Revival of Rinzai and Otokan===
Hakuin is generally considered as the reviver of the Japanese Rinzai-tradition from a long period of stagnation and decline of monastic rigor. Yet, Ahn notes that this also a matter of perception, and that multiple factors are at play here. In Hakuin&#x27;s time, support from the upper classes for the Zen-institutions had waned, and Zen-temples had to secure other means of support, finding it in a lay-audience. There was also the challenge of the Chinese Ōbaku-school, with its emphasis on rigorous communal training and more accessible teachings. Heine and Wright note that:
As a result of their approach, which caused a stir in Japan, many Rinzai and Sōtō masters undertook reforming and revitalizing their own monastic institutions, partly incorporating Ōbaku, partly rejecting them. Kogetsu Zenzai welcomed their influence, and Rinzai master Ungo Kiyō even began implementing the use of &quot;nembutsu&quot; into his training regimen at Zuigan-ji. Other teachers, not only Hakuin, responded to these challenges by harking back to the roots of their own school, and by adapting their style of teaching. Hakuin was affiliated to Myōshin-ji and the Ōtōkan lineage, and sought to restore what he considered as the authentic, China-derived and koan-oriented Zen-practice of the Otokan-lineage and its founders, Dai&#x27;ō Kokushi (Nanpo Shōmyō (1235–1308), who received dharma-transmission in China from Xutang Zhiyu; Daitō Kokushi (Shuho Myocho) (1283-1338); and Kanzan Egen (1277–1360). While the communal training of the Ōbaku-school was emulated,
Hakuin&#x27;s outreach to a lay-audience fits into these Japanese responses to these challenges. The &quot;ringe&quot;-monasteries Myoshin-ji and Daitoku-ji, belonging to the Otokan-lineage, rose to prominence in these new circumstances.

===Lineage===
Hakuin took ordination in a Mioshi-ji affiliated temple, and remained loyal to this institution and its lineage throughout his life. In 1718, when he was installed as head priest, Hakuin noted Torin Sosho as his &quot;master,&quot; but after his awakening to the importance of &quot;karuna&quot; and understanding Shōju Rōjin&#x27;s stress on sustained post-satori practice, Hakuin regarded Shōju Rōjin as his principal teacher, though he never received formal dharma transmission from him. Little is known of Shōju Rōjin, and his historicity has even been questioned, yet confirmed by Nakamura. While traced back to the Otokan-lineage, Shōju Rōjin&#x27;s fell into obscurity in the 16th century, and little is known of the 16th-century teachers.

Hakuin&#x27;s closest student and companion was Tōrei Enji (1721-1792), who first studied with Kogetsu Zenzai, and to whom Hakuin presented his robe as a token of recognition.

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages are related to Hakuin through Gasan Jitō (1727–1797) and his students Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833). Gasan received Dharma transmission from Rinzai teacher Gessen Zen&#x27;e, who had received dharma transmission from Kogetsu Zenzai, before meeting Hakuin. While Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, &quot;he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin&#x27;s dharma heirs,&quot; studying with Hakuin but completing his koan-training with Tōrei Enji.

===Lay teachings===
An extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing liberation to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the rural population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in Kyoto, preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from Confucianism, ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools&#x27; practices in his writings.

===Lecturing tours and writing===
In later life Hakuin was a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the vernacular, and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read.

===Calligraphy===
An important element of Hakuin&#x27;s Zen-teaching and pedagogy was his painting and calligraphy. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of &quot;visual sermons&quot; that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were illiterate. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world&#x27;s leading museums.

===Systematisation of koan-practice===
Hakuin&#x27;s emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans in a set sequence by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher. If the teacher feels the student has handled the koan in a satisfactory way, then they receive the standard answer, and the next koan in the sequence is assigned.

Gasan Jitō (1727–1797), who received dharma transmission from Hakuin&#x27;s heir 
Tōrei Enji (1721-1792), and Gasan&#x27;s students Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833) developed a fivefold classification system:&lt;br&gt;
1. &quot;Hosshin&quot;, dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into sunyata. They reveal the dharmakaya, or Fundamental. They introduce &quot;the undifferentiated and the unconditional&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
2. &quot;Kikan&quot;, dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view; Where &quot;hosshin&quot; koans represent &quot;tai&quot;, substance, &quot;kikan&quot; koans represent &quot;yu&quot;, function.&lt;br&gt;
3. &quot;Gonsen&quot;, explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters. They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.&lt;br&gt;
4. &quot;Hachi Nanto&quot;, eight &quot;difficult to pass&quot; koans. There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through &quot;satori&quot;. It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans. Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten &quot;hachi nanto&quot; koans.&lt;br&gt;
5. &quot;Goi jujukin&quot; koans, the Five Ranks of Tozan and the Ten Grave Precepts.

Hakuin&#x27;s main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the example and inspiration he set with his own determination an vigour for koan. The standardisation of collective zazen-practice, introducing scheduled sesshin at Mioshi-ji and its affiliated temples in the 18th century, may be an important institutional factor, requiring standardised practice-tools.

==Writings==
Hakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and Kanbun Works (4 vols.). The following are the best known, and also translated in English:
* &quot;Orategama&quot; (遠羅天釜), &quot;The Embossed Tea Kettle&quot;, a letter collection. 
* &quot;Yasen kanna&quot; (夜船閑話), &quot;Idle Talk on a Night Boat&quot;, a work on health-improving meditation techniques (qigong).

<text>Jean Mouton (c. 1459 – 30 October 1522) was a French composer of the Renaissance. He was famous both for his motets, which are among the most refined of the time, and for being the teacher of Adrian Willaert, one of the founders of the Venetian School.

== Life ==
He was born Jean de Hollingue either in 1459 or earlier, but records of his early life, as is so often the case with Renaissance composers, are scant. Most likely he was from the village of Haut-Wignes (now Wirwignes), near Boulogne-sur-Mer, in Samer. He probably began his first job, singer and teacher at the collegiate church in Saint Omer, then moved to Nesle (southeast of Amiens) in 1477, where he served as a chorister for the next six years. In 1483, he was made &quot;maître de chapelle&quot; there. Sometime around this time he became a priest, and he is believed to have studied with Josquin des Prez.

In 1500 he was in charge of choirboys at the cathedral in Amiens. In 1501 he was in Grenoble, again teaching choirboys, but he left the next year, most likely entering the service of Queen Anne of Brittany, and in 1509 he was granted a position again in Grenoble which he could hold &quot;in absentia&quot;. Mouton was now the principal composer for the French court. For the remainder of his life he was employed by the French court in one capacity or another, often writing music for state occasions—weddings, coronations, papal elections, births and deaths.

Mouton composed a motet, &quot;Christus vincit&quot;, for the election of Leo X as pope in 1513. Leo evidently liked Mouton&#x27;s music, for he rewarded him with the honorary title, &quot;apostolic notary&quot; on the occasion of a motet he composed for the pope in 1515; the pope made this award during a meeting in Bologna between the French king and the pope after the Battle of Marignano. This trip to Italy was the first, and probably only trip that Mouton made outside France.

Sometime between 1517 and 1522 the Swiss music theorist Heinrich Glarean met Mouton, and praised him effusively; he wrote that &quot;everyone had copies of his music.&quot; Glarean used several examples of Mouton&#x27;s music in his influential treatise, the &quot;Dodecachordon&quot;.

Mouton may have been the editor of the illuminated manuscript known as the &quot;Medici Codex,&quot; one of the primary manuscript sources of the time, which was a wedding gift for Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici.

It is considered to be possible that Mouton was in charge of the elaborate musical festivities by the French at the meeting between François I and Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, based on the similarity to the festivities five years earlier after the Battle of Marignano.

Near the end of his life, Mouton moved to Saint-Quentin. According to the engraving on his tombstone, he became a canon at the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, taking over for Loyset Compère who died in 1518. Mouton died in Saint-Quentin and is buried there. The headstone, now missing, was engraved as follows:

 CI GIST MAISTRE JEAN DE HOLLINGUE, DIT MOUTON,
 EN SON VIVANT CHANTRE DU ROY
 CHANOINE DE THEROUANNE ET DE CETTE EGLISE
 QUI TRESPASSA LE PENULTIEME JOUR D&#x27;OCTOBRE MDXXII
 PRIEZ DIEU POUR SON AME

== Music and influence ==

Mouton was hugely influential both as a composer and as a teacher. Of his music, 9 Magnificat settings, 15 masses, 20 chansons, and over 100 motets survive; since he was a court composer for a king, the survival rate of his music is relatively high for the period, it being widely distributed, copied, and archived. In addition, the famous publisher Ottaviano Petrucci printed an entire volume of Mouton&#x27;s masses (early in the history of music printing, most publications contained works by multiple composers). His work was also published by Pierre Attaingnant.

The style of Mouton&#x27;s music has superficial similarities to that of Josquin des Prez, using paired imitation, canonic techniques, and equal-voiced polyphonic writing: yet Mouton tends to write rhythmically and texturally uniform music compared to Josquin, with all the voices singing, and with relatively little textural contrast. Glarean characterized Mouton&#x27;s melodic style with the phrase &quot;his melody flows in a supple thread.&quot;

Around 1500, Mouton seems to have become more aware of chords and harmonic feeling, probably due to his encounter with Italian music. At any rate this was a period of transition between purely linear thinking in music, in which chords were incidental occurrences as a result of correct usage of intervals, and music in which the harmonic element was foremost (for example in lighter Italian forms such as the frottola, which are homophonic in texture and sometimes have frankly diatonic harmony).

Mouton was a fine musical craftsman throughout his life, highly regarded by his contemporaries and much in demand by his royal patrons. His music was reprinted and continued to attract other composers even later in the 16th century, especially two joyful Christmas motets he wrote, &quot;Noe, noe psallite noe,&quot; and &quot;Quaeramus cum pastoribus&quot;, which several later composers used as the basis for masses.

He also influenced posthumously the outstanding music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino, himself a pupil of Willaert, who referred to him, somewhat enthusiastically as his &quot;precettore&quot;.

<text>Paul Bley, CM (November 10, 1932 – January 3, 2016) was a Canadian jazz pianist known for his contributions to the free jazz movement of the 1960s as well as his innovations and influence on trio playing and his early live performance on the Moog and ARP synthesizers. His music has been described by Ben Ratliff of the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;deeply original and aesthetically aggressive&quot;. Bley&#x27;s prolific output includes influential recordings from the 1950s through to his solo piano recordings of the 2000s.

==Early life==
Bley was born in Montreal, Quebec, on November 10, 1932. His adoptive parents were Betty Marcovitch, an immigrant from Romania, and Joseph Bley, owner of an embroidery factory, who named him Hyman Bley. However, in 1993 a relative from the New York branch of the Bley family walked into the Sweet Basil Jazz Club in New York City and informed Bley that his father was actually his biological parent. At age five Bley began studying the violin, but at age seven, after his mother divorced his father, he decided to switch to the piano. By eleven he had received a junior diploma from the McGill Conservatory in Montreal. At thirteen he formed a band which played at summer resorts in Ste. Agathe, Quebec. As a teenager he changed his name to &quot;Paul,&quot; thinking that girls would find it more attractive. Also as a teenager, he played with touring American bands, including Al Cowan&#x27;s Tramp Band. In 1949, when Bley was starting his senior year of high school, Oscar Peterson asked Bley to fulfill his contract at the Alberta Lounge in Montreal. The next year Bley left Montreal for New York City and Juilliard. Bley lived in the United States for his entire adult life, but never renounced his Canadian citizenship.

== 1950s ==

In 1951, on summer break from Juilliard, Bley returned to Montreal where he helped organize the Montreal Jazz Workshop. In 1953 Bley invited the bebop alto saxophonist and composer Charlie Parker to the Jazz Workshop, where he played and recorded with him, making the record &quot;Charlie Parker Montreal 1953&quot;. When Bley returned to New York City he hired Jackie McLean, Al Levitt and Doug Watkins to play an extended gig at the Copa City on Long Island. From the early 1950s until 1960 Bley did a series of trios with Al Levitt and Peter Ind; recordings of this trio in 1954 were included in the Mercury album &quot;Paul Bley&quot;. In 1953 the Shaw Agency booked Bley and his trio to tour with Lester Young, billed as &quot;Lester Young and the Paul Bley Trio&quot; in ads. He also performed with tenor saxophonist Ben Webster at that time. Additionally, in 1953, Charles Mingus produced the &quot;Introducing Paul Bley&quot; album for his label, Debut Records with Mingus on bass and drummer Art Blakey. (In 1960 Bley recorded again with the Charles Mingus Group.)

In 1954, Bley received a call from Chet Baker inviting him to play opposite Baker&#x27;s quintet at Jazz City in Hollywood, California for the month of March. This was followed by a tour with singer Dakota Staton. &quot;Down Beat Magazine&quot; interviewed Bley for its July 13, 1955, issue. The prescient title of the article read, &quot;PAUL BLEY, Jazz Is Just About Ready for Another Revolution&quot;. The article, reprinted in Down Beat&#x27;s 50th Anniversary edition, quoted Bley as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to write longer forms, I&#x27;d like to write music without a chordal center.&quot;

Bley&#x27;s trio with Hal Gaylor and Lennie McBrowne toured across the US in 1956, including a club in Juarez. Mexico. The tour culminated with an invitation to play a 1956 New Year&#x27;s Eve gig at Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz&#x27;s home in Palm Springs. During the evening, Bley collapsed on the bandstand with a bleeding ulcer and Lucy immediately took him to the Palm Springs hospital where she proceeded to pay for all of his medical care. Bley, who had met Karen Borg while she was working as a cigarette girl at Birdland in NYC, married her after she came out to meet him in Los Angeles, where she became Carla Bley.

In 1957, Bley stayed in Los Angeles where he had the house band at the Hillcrest Club. By 1958 the original band, with vibe player, Dave Pike, evolved into a quintet with Bley hiring young avant garde musicians trumpet player Don Cherry, alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins.

== 1960s ==
In the early 1960s, Bley was part of a trio with Jimmy Giuffre on reeds and Steve Swallow on bass. Its repertoire included compositions by Giuffre, Bley and his now ex-wife, composer Carla Bley. The group&#x27;s music presented innovations in chamber jazz and free jazz. The 1961 European tour of The Giuffre 3 shocked a public expecting Bebop, however the many recordings released from this tour have proven to be classics of free jazz. During the same period, Bley was touring and recording with tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, which culminated with the RCA Victor album &quot;Sonny Meets Hawk!&quot; with tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins. Bley&#x27;s solo on &quot;All the Things You Are&quot; from this album has been called &quot;the shot heard around the world&quot; by Pat Metheny.

In 1964, Bley was instrumental in the formation of the Jazz Composers Guild, a co-operative organization which brought together many free jazz musicians in New York: Bill Dixon, Roswell Rudd, Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, Carla Bley, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, and others. The guild organized weekly concerts and created a forum for the &quot;October Revolution&quot; of 1964. The influential album, &quot;Turning Point&quot;, released by Improvising Artists in 1975, was recorded in 1964 when Bley brought John Gilmore, Gary Peacock, and Paul Motian to the University of Washington.

In the late 1960s, Bley pioneered the use of the ARP and Moog synthesizers, doing the first live synthesizer performance at Philharmonic Hall in New York City on December 26, 1969. This &quot;Bley-Peacock Synthesizer Show&quot; performance, a group with singer/composer Annette Peacock, who had written much of his personal repertoire since 1964, was followed by her playing on the recordings &quot;Dual Unity&quot; (credited to &quot;Annette &amp; Paul Bley&quot;) and &quot;Improvisie&quot;. The latter was a French release of two extended improvisational tracks with Bley on synthesizers, Peacock&#x27;s voice and keyboards, and percussion by Dutch free jazz drummer Han Bennink, who had also appeared on part of &quot;Dual Unity&quot;.

== 1970s ==
In 1972, Manfred Eicher released Bley&#x27;s first solo piano recording, Open, to Love, on ECM Records. Bley also released the trio album, Paul Bley &amp; Scorpio for Milestone Records in 1972 on which he plays two electric pianos and Arp synthesizer. In 1974, Bley and video artist Carol Goss, his second wife, founded the production company Improvising Artists, known as IAI Records &amp; Video. The label issued acoustic recordings by many of the most creative improvisers of the twentieth century as well as the electric quartet album, &quot;Jaco&quot;, the debut recording of Pat Metheny on electric guitar and Jaco Pastorius on electric bass, with Bley on electric piano and Bruce Ditmas on drums. IAI records and videos include performances by Jimmy Giuffre, Lee Konitz, Dave Holland, Marion Brown, Gunter Hampel, Lester Bowie, Steve Lacy, Ran Blake, Perry Robinson, Naná Vasconcelos, Badal Roy, John Gilmore, Gary Peacock, two solo piano records by Sun Ra, and others. Bley and Carol Goss are credited in a &quot;Billboard&quot; cover story with the first commercial &quot;music video&quot;. Goss produced live video recordings with IAI Records artists, projecting the images from analog video synthesizers during the performances. In addition, her video art is often accompanied by Paul Bley&#x27;s solo piano music as well as his electric band recordings, some of which have not yet been released on audio records.

== 1980s ==
Bley was featured in Ron Mann&#x27;s 1981 documentary film &quot;Imagine the Sound&quot;, in which he performs and discusses the evolution of free jazz and his music. Bley began to record for multiple labels in the 1980s in many different formats including: solo piano albums &quot;Tears&quot; for Owl Records, &quot;Tango Palace&quot; for Soulnote, &quot;PAUL BLEY SOLO&quot; for Justin Time Records, &quot;Blues for Red&quot; for Red Records, and &quot;Solo Piano&quot; for SteepleChase Records; duo and larger-group recordings &quot;Diane (album)&quot; with Chet Baker for SteepleChase Records, &quot;The Montreal Tapes&quot; with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian for Verve, &quot;Fragments&quot; with John Surman, Bill Frisell, and Paul Motian for ECM, three new recordings with Jimmy Giuffre and Steve Swallow for Owl Records, and numerous other recordings.

== 1990s ==
Bley continued to tour in Europe, Japan, South America and the US recording prolifically as a soloist and with a wide range of ensembles. In 1993 the Montreal International Jazz Festival produced a Paul Bley Homage concert series of four nights. In some years he recorded more than eight albums. Notably, Bley revisited the synthesizer in a record for Postcards titled &quot;Synthesis&quot;.

During this time, Bley also became a part-time faculty member of the New England Music Conservatory, where he taught musicians Satoko Fujii and Yitzhak Yedid. He would travel to Boston for one day a month, ostensibly to have lobster, often meeting with students in coffee shops as he considered that they already knew how to play, but needed guidance in life.

The American television network Bravo and the French-German network Arte co-produced a one-hour biography of Paul Bley in 1998.

Bley&#x27;s autobiography was published in 1999 (&quot;Stopping Time&quot;: &quot;Paul Bley and the Transformation of Jazz&quot;)

== 2000s ==
In 2001 the National Archives of Canada acquired Bley&#x27;s archives. In 2003 a book based on Bley interviews by musicologist Norman Meehan (&quot;Time Will Tell&quot;) was published. It was an in depth discussion of the process of improvisation. In 2008, he was made a member of the Order of Canada. In 2009 the book &quot;Paul Bley: The Logic of Chance&quot;, written in Italian by jazz pianist Arrigo Cappelletti and translated into English by jazz pianist Greg Burk, was published. In addition to touring solo in the US and Europe, Bley released several solo piano recordings in this decade, including &quot;Basics&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Declare&quot; and &quot;About Time&quot; for Justin Time Records and &quot;Solo in Mondsee&quot; and &quot;Play Blue - Oslo Concert&quot; for ECM Records. Paul Bley&#x27;s last public performances were in 2010 playing a solo piano concert at the La Villette Jazz Festival in Paris, followed by a duo with Charlie Haden at BlueNote in New York City during a full moon. Paul Bley died of natural causes on January 3, 2016, at home in Stuart, Florida, aged 83.

<text>A respirator is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres including lead fumes, vapors, gases and particulate matter such as dusts and airborne pathogens such as viruses. There are two main categories of respirators: the &quot;air-purifying respirator&quot;, in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the &quot;air-supplied respirator&quot;, in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.

Air-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive, single-use, disposable face masks, known as filtering facepiece respirators, reusable models with replaceable cartridges called elastomeric respirators, to powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR), which use a pump or fan to constantly move air through a filter and supply purified air into a mask, helmet or hood.

== History ==
=== Earliest records to 19th century ===

The history of protective respiratory equipment can be traced back as far as the first century, when Pliny the Elder (–79) described using animal bladder skins to protect workers in Roman mines from red lead oxide dust. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci suggested that a finely woven cloth dipped in water could protect sailors from a toxic weapon made of powder that he had designed.

Alexander von Humboldt introduced a primitive respirator in 1799 when he worked as a mining engineer in Prussia.

Julius Jeffreys first used the word &quot;respirator&quot; as a mask in 1836.
In 1848, the first US patent for an air-purifying respirator was granted to Lewis P. Haslett for his &#x27;Haslett&#x27;s Lung Protector,&#x27; which filtered dust from the air using one-way clapper valves and a filter made of moistened wool or a similar porous substance. Hutson Hurd patented a cup-shaped mask in 1879 which became widespread in industrial use.

Inventors in Europe included John Stenhouse, a Scottish chemist, who investigated the power of charcoal in its various forms, to capture and hold large volumes of gas. He built one of the first respirators able to remove toxic gases from the air, paving the way for activated charcoal to become the most widely used filter for respirators. Irish physicist John Tyndall took Stenhouse&#x27;s mask, added a filter of cotton wool saturated with lime, glycerin, and charcoal, and in 1871 invented a &#x27;fireman&#x27;s respirator&#x27;, a hood that filtered smoke and gas from air, which he exhibited at a meeting of the Royal Society in London in 1874. Also in 1874, Samuel Barton patented a device that &#x27;permitted respiration in places where the atmosphere is charged with noxious gases, or vapors, smoke, or other impurities.&#x27;

In the late 19th century, Miles Philips began using a &quot;mundebinde&quot; (&quot;mouth bandage&quot;) of sterilized cloth which he refined by adapting a chloroform mask with two layers of cotton mull.

=== 20th century ===
==== World War I ====

==== United States ====
In the 1970s, the successor to the United States Bureau of Mines and NIOSH developed standards for single-use respirators, and the first single-use respirator was developed by 3M and approved in 1972. 3M used a melt blowing process that it had developed decades prior and used in products such as ready-made ribbon bows and bra cups; its use in a wide array of products had been pioneered by designer Sara Little Turnbull.

==== 1990s ====
=== 21st century ===
==== Continuing mesothelioma litigation ==== 
NIOSH certifies B Readers, people qualified to testify or provide evidence in mesothelioma personal injury lawsuits, &quot;in addition to&quot; regulating respirators. However, since 2000, the increasing scope of claims related to mesothelioma started to include respirator manufacturers to the tune of 325,000 cases, despite the primary use of respirators being to prevent asbestos and silica-related diseases. Most of these cases were not successful, or reached settlements of around $1000 per litigant, well below the cost of mesothelioma treatment. 

One reason is due to the fact that respirator manufacturers are not allowed to modify a respirator once it is certified by NIOSH. In one case, a jury ruled against 3M for a respirator that was initially approved for asbestos, but was quickly disapproved once OSHA permissible exposure limits for asbestos changed. Combined with testimony that the plaintiff &quot;rarely&quot; wore a respirator around asbestos, the lack of evidence, and the limitation of liability from static NIOSH approval, the case was overturned.

Nonetheless, the costs of litigation reduced the margins for respirators, which was blamed for supply shortages for N95 respirators for anticipated pandemics, like avian influenza, during the 2000s.

==== 2020 ====
China normally makes 10 million masks per day, about half of the world production. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 2,500 factories were converted to produce 116 million daily.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people in the United States, and in a lot of countries in the world, were urged to make their own cloth masks due to the widespread shortage of commercial masks.

==== 2024 ====

== Summary of modern respirators ==

All respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer&#x27;s head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method. Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes to accommodate all types of face shapes.

A full facepiece covers the mouth, nose and eyes and if sealed, is sealed round the perimeter of the face. Unsealed versions may be used when air is supplied at a rate which prevents ambient gas from reaching the nose or mouth during inhalation.

Respirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators are only effective in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area.

An escape respirator may have no component that would normally be described as a mask, and may use a bite-grip mouthpiece and nose clip instead. Alternatively, an escape respirator could be a time-limited self-contained breathing apparatus.

For hazardous environments, like confined spaces, atmosphere-supplying respirators, like SCBAs, should be used.

A wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare &amp; pharmaceuticals, defense &amp; public safety services (defense, firefighting &amp; law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, painting, shipbuilding, and the textile industry.

Respirators require user training in order to provide proper protection.

== Use ==
=== User seal check ===

Each time a wearer dons a respirator, they must perform a seal check to be sure that they have an airtight seal to the face so that air does not leak around the edges of the respirator. (PAPR respirators may not require this because they don&#x27;t necessarily seal to the face.) This check is different than the periodic fit test that is performed using testing equipment. Filtering facepiece respirators are typically checked by cupping the hands over the facepiece while exhaling (positive pressure check) or inhaling (negative pressure check) and observing any air leakage around the facepiece. Elastomeric respirators are checked in a similar manner, except the wearer blocks the airways through the inlet valves (negative pressure check) or exhalation valves (positive pressure check) while observing the flexing of the respirator or air leakage. Manufacturers have different methods for performing seal checks and wearers should consult the specific instructions for the model of respirator they are wearing. Some models of respirators or filter cartridges have special buttons or other mechanisms built into them to facilitate seal checks.

== Respirator selection ==
Air-purifying respirators are respirators that draw in the surrounding air and purify it before it is breathed (unlike air-supplying respirators, which are sealed systems, with no air intake, like those used underwater). Air-purifying respirators &quot;filter&quot; particulates, gases, and vapors from the air, and may be negative-pressure respirators driven by the wearer&#x27;s inhalation and exhalation, or positive-pressure units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).

According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, air-purifying respirators are recommended for concentrations of hazardous particulates or gases that are greater than the relevant occupational exposure limit but less than the immediately dangerous to life or health level and the manufacturer&#x27;s maximum use concentration, subject to the respirator having a sufficient assigned protection factor. For substances hazardous to the eyes, a respirator equipped with a full facepiece, helmet, or hood is recommended. Air-purifying respirators are not effective during firefighting, in oxygen-deficient atmosphere, or in an unknown atmosphere; in these situations a self-contained breathing apparatus is recommended instead.

== Types of filtration ==

=== Mechanical filter ===
: &quot;Main Article: Mechanical filter respirator (and regulatory ratings)&quot; 

Mechanical filters remove contaminants from air in several ways: &quot;interception&quot; when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it; &quot;impaction&quot;, when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity; by &quot;diffusion&quot;, where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100 nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter, increasing the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the previous two mechanisms; and by using an electrostatic charge that attracts and holds particles on the filter surface.

There are many different filtration standards that vary by jurisdiction. In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health defines the categories of particulate filters according to their NIOSH air filtration rating. The most common of these are the N95 respirator, which filters at least 95% of airborne particles but is not resistant to oil.

Other categories filter 99% or 99.97% of particles, or have varying degrees of resistance to oil.

In the European Union, European standard EN 143 defines the &#x27;P&#x27; classes of particle filters that can be attached to a face mask, while European standard EN 149 defines classes of &quot;filtering half masks&quot; or &quot;filtering facepieces&quot;, usually called FFP masks.

According to 3M, the filtering media in respirators made according to the following standards are similar to U.S. N95 or European FFP2 respirators, however, the construction of the respirators themselves, such as providing a proper seal to the face, varies considerably. (For example, US NIOSH-approved respirators never include earloops because they don&#x27;t provide enough support to establish a reliable, airtight seal.) Standards for respirator filtration the Chinese KN95, Australian / New Zealand P2, Korean 1st Class also referred to as KF94, and Japanese DS.

=== Canister or chemical cartridge ===

Chemical cartridges and gas mask canisters remove gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other vapors from breathing air by adsorption, absorption, or chemisorption. A typical organic vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40 grams of sorption media such as activated charcoal or certain resins. The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer. When filter cartridges become saturated or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.

If the concentration of harmful gases is immediately dangerous to life or health, in workplaces covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration specifies the use of air-supplied respirators except when intended solely for escape during emergencies. NIOSH also discourages their use under such conditions.
== Air-purifying respirators ==

=== Filtering facepiece ===

=== Elastomeric ===

=== Powered air-purifying respirators ===
== Atmosphere-supplying respirators ==

These respirators do not purify the ambient air, but supply breathing gas from another source. The three types are the self contained breathing apparatus, in which a compressed air cylinder is worn by the wearer; the supplied air respirators, where a hose supplies air from a stationary source; and combination supplied-air respirators, with an emergency backup tank.

=== Under 30 CFR 11 ===

In 1992, NIOSH published a draft report on the effectiveness of respirator regulations under the then-current 30 CFR 11. Particulate respirators back then were mainly classified as either DM, DFM, or HEPA.

==== Respirator risk modelling ====
Assigned protection factors (APF) are predicated on the assumption that users are trained in the use of their respirators, and that &quot;100%&quot; of users exceed the APF. This &quot;simulated workplace protection factor&quot; (SWPF) was said to be problematic:

The ideal assumption of &quot;all&quot; respirator users exceeding the APF is termed the &quot;zero control failure rate&quot; by NIOSH. The term &quot;control failure rate&quot; here refers to the number of respirator users, per 100 users, that fail to reach the APF. The risk of user error affecting the &quot;failure rate&quot;, and the studies quantifying it, was, according to NIOSH, akin to the study of contraception failure rates. 

This is despite there being a &quot;reasonable expectation, of both purchasers and users, [that] &quot;none&quot; of the users will receive less protection than the class APF (when the masks are properly selected, fit tested by the employer, and properly worn by the users)&quot;. NIOSH expands on the methods for measuring this error in Chapter 7 of the draft report.

==== Qualitative fit testing ====
Qualitative fit testing with isoamyl acetate, irritant smoke, and saccharin were proposed as alternatives to quantitative fit testing in the 1980s, but doubts were raised as to its efficacy. 

With regards to the effectiveness of fit testing in general, others have said: 

==== Exercise protocols ====
With regards to fit test &quot;protocols&quot;, it was noted by NIOSH that &quot;time pressures&quot; resulted in the exclusion of intense exercises meant to simulate workplace use: 
Neither exercise was included in the OSHA fit test protocols. Put another way, it has been said: 

==== Noncompliance with regulation ====
In spite of the requirement to fit test by OSHA, the following observations of noncompliance with respirator regulations were made by NIOSH and OSHA:
* Almost 80% of negative-pressure respirator wearers were not receiving fit testing.
* Over 70% of 123,000 manufacturing plants did not perform exposure-level monitoring, when selecting respirators to use in the plants.
* Noncompliance increased to almost 90% for the smallest plants.
* 75% of manufacturing plants did not have a written program.
* 56% of manufacturing plants did not have a professional respirator-program administrator (i.e., qualified individual supervising the program).
* Almost 50% of wearers in manufacturing plants did not receive an annual examination by a physician.
* Almost 50% of wearers in manufacturing plants did not receive respirator-use training.
* 80% of wearers in manufacturing plants did not have access to more than one facial-size mask, even though nearly all reusable masks were available in at least three sizes.
These noncompliance errors make up what NIOSH calls the &quot;program protection factor&quot;:

==== Adherence to the regulatory minimum ====

APFs may be based on the filtration performance from one or two manufacturers that barely pass the regulation. When the DM and DFM respirator filter standards at the time were found to have an unacceptably high filter leakage, NIOSH proposed lowering the APF for DM respirators from 10 to 2. On this scale, 1 is a completely ineffective respirator. Some respirator manufacturers, like 3M, complained that DM and DFM respirators with superior filtration, that would normally receive an APF well above 2, were being &quot;held hostage&quot; by poorly-performing respirators. While NIOSH acknowledged the predicament poorly-performing respirators were having on superior respirators in the same class, they concluded that the APFs, for respirator classes like DFM halfmask respirators, should be lowered to at least 6, despite APFs of 6 through 10 being allowed previously for DFM halfmasks.

ANSI suggested additional contaminant monitoring by employers to allow for the use of DM and DFM respirators, when the mass median aerodynamic diameter of dusts in contaminated workplaces is such that DM and DFM respirators &quot;could work&quot;. However, NIOSH pointed out that the poor adherence to OSHA regulations on exposure-level monitoring by employers, as well as lack of expertise in interpreting the collected data, would likely result in more workers being put at risk. In addition, NIOSH pointed out that the ANSI recommendations would effectively mandate the use of &quot;expensive&quot; Part 11 HEPA filters under Part 11 regulations, due to lack of adherence to exposure-level monitoring rules.

=== Hierarchy of Controls point of view under 42 CFR 84 ===
The Hierarchy of Controls, noted as part of the &quot;Prevention Through Design&quot; initiative started by NIOSH with other standards bodies, is a set of guidelines emphasizing building in safety during design, as opposed to ad-hoc solutions like PPE, with multiple entities providing guidelines on how to implement safety during development outside of NIOSH-approved respirators. US Government entities currently and formerly involved in the regulation of respirators follow the Hierarchy of Controls, including OSHA and MSHA.

However, some HOC implementations, notably MSHA&#x27;s, have been criticized for allowing mining operators to skirt engineering control noncompliance by requiring miners to wear respirators instead if the permissible exposure limit (PEL) is exceeded, without work stoppages, breaking the hierarchy of engineering controls. Another concern was fraud related to the inability to scrutinize engineering controls, unlike NIOSH-approved respirators, like the N95, which can be fit tested by anyone, are subject to the scrutiny of NIOSH, and are trademarked and protected under US federal law. NIOSH also noted, in a 2002 video about TB respirator use, that &quot;engineering controls, like negative pressure isolation rooms may not control the TB hazard completely. The use of respirators is necessary&quot;.

==== Respirator non-compliance ====

With regards to people complying with requirements to wear respirators, various papers note high respirator non-compliance across industries, with a survey noting non-compliance was due in large part due to discomfort from temperature increases along the face, and a large amount of respondents also noting the social unacceptability of provided N95 respirators during the survey. For reasons like mishandling, ill-fitting respirators and lack of training, the Hierarchy of Controls dictates respirators be evaluated last while other controls exist and are working. Alternative controls like hazard elimination, administrative controls, and engineering controls like ventilation are less likely to fail due to user discomfort or error.

A U.S. Department of Labor study showed that in almost 40 thousand American enterprises, the requirements for the correct use of respirators are not always met. Experts note that in practice it is difficult to achieve elimination of occupational morbidity with the help of respirators:

===== Beards =====

Certain types of facial hair can reduce fit to a significant degree. For this reason, there are facial hair guidelines for respirator users.

==== Counterfeiting, modification, and revocation of regulated respirators ====
Another disadvantage of respirators is that the onus is on the respirator user to determine if their respirator is counterfeit or has had its certification revoked. Customers and employers can inadvertently purchase non-OEM parts for a NIOSH-approved respirator which void the NIOSH approval and violate OSHA laws, in addition to potentially compromising the fit of the respirator.

==== Issues with fit testing ====
If respirators &quot;must&quot; be used, under 29 CFR 1910.134, OSHA requires respirator users to conduct a respirator fit test, with a safety factor of 10 to offset lower fit during real world use. However, NIOSH notes the large amount of time required for fit testing has been a point of contention for employers.

Other opinions concern the change in performance of respirators in use compared to when fit testing, and compared to engineering control alternatives:

=== Issues with respirator design ===
Extended or off-label use of certain negative-pressure respirators, like a filtering facepiece respirator paired with a surgical mask, can result in higher levels of carbon dioxide from dead space and breathing resistance (pressure drop) which can impact functioning and sometimes can exceed the PEL. This effect was significantly reduced with powered air purifying respirators. In various surveys among healthcare workers, headaches, dermatitis and acne have been reported.

Complaints have been leveled at early LANL NIOSH fit test panels (which included primarily military personnel) as being unrepresentative of the broader American populace. However, later fit test panels, based on a NIOSH facial survey conducted in 2003, were able to reach 95% representation of working US population surveyed. Despite these developments, 42 CFR 84, the US regulation NIOSH follows for respirator approval, allows for respirators that don&#x27;t follow the NIOSH fit test panel provided that: more than one facepiece size is provided, and no chemical cartridges are made available.

=== Issues with lack of regulation ===
Respirators designed to non-US standards may not be subject to as much or any scrutiny:
* In China, under GB2626-2019, which includes standards like KN95, there is no procedure for fit testing.
Some jurisdictions allow for respirator filtration ratings lower than 95%, respirators which are &quot;not&quot; rated to prevent respiratory infection, asbestos, or other dangerous occupational hazards. These respirators are sometimes known as dust masks for their almost exclusive approval only against dust nuisances:
* In Europe, regulation allows for dust masks under FFP1, where 20% inward leakage is allowed, with a minimum filtration efficiency of 80%.
* South Korea allows 20% filter leakage under KF80.
In the US, NIOSH noted that under standards predating the N95, &#x27;Dust/Mist&#x27; rated respirators could not prevent the spread of TB.

== Regulation ==
The choice and use of respirators in developed countries is regulated by national legislation. To ensure that employers choose respirators correctly, and perform high-quality respiratory protection programs, various guides and textbooks have been developed:
For standard filter classes used in respirators, see Mechanical filter (respirator)#Filtration standards.

<text>Whitney Smith Jr. (February 26, 1940 – November 17, 2016) was an American vexillologist. He coined the term &quot;vexillology&quot;, which refers to the scholarly analysis of all aspects of flags. He was a founder of several vexillology organizations. Smith was a Laureate and a Fellow of the International Federation of Vexillological Associations.

==Early life and education==
Whitney Smith Jr. was born on February 26, 1940, to Mildred and Whitney Smith. As a youth, he lived in Lexington and Winchester, Massachusetts. Smith credited his interest in flags to his memories of Massachusetts Patriots&#x27; Day celebrations and a gift of &quot;The Golden Encyclopedia&quot; when he was about 6 years old.

At Harvard, he studied political science and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the field in 1961. During his time at Harvard, Smith designed the flag of Guyana after corresponding with Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan via mail. He received his doctorate in political science at Boston University in 1968; political symbolism was the subject of his dissertation.

==Career==

Smith had his first article published at age 18. By 1960, he was consulting with the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

In 1961, Smith and colleague Gerhard Grahl co-founded &quot;The Flag Bulletin&quot; (), the world&#x27;s first journal about flags. The following year, Smith established The Flag Research Center at his home and was its director.

Smith worked with Klaes Sierksma to organize the First International Congress of Vexillology (Muiderberg, Netherlands) in 1965. They joined Louis Mühlemann in founding the International League of Vexillologists and were members of its Governing Board on September 5, 1965, and operated until September 3, 1967. The league was replaced by the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (known by its French acronym FIAV) with Smith as vice-president of the Provisional Council as of September 3, 1967. In 1969, Smith moved from being FIAV Provisional Council vice-president to being the first Secretary-General of FIAV. Smith was also responsible for founding the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) and the Flag Heritage Foundation. On August 28, 1981, he was elected the second Secretary-General for Congresses, ending his multiple terms as FIAV Secretary-General. Smith served in that office until he returned to the FIAV Secretary-General position on September 29, 1983.

Smith quit his full-time professorship at Boston University in 1970. By 1985, he had written 19 books.

On July 5, 1991, Smith was named by the FIAV a Laureate of the Federation and left the office of FIAV Secretary-General. He was given the honor of Fellow of the Federation on July 27, 2001.

In 2006 he was the joint author of &quot;The American Flag: Two Centuries of Concord &amp; Conflict&quot;

In 2013 he transferred The Flag Research Center&#x27;s library and archives to The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History.

On November 17, 2016, Smith died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the age of 76.

==Bibliography==
Smith wrote 27 books on the subject of flags, notably &quot;Flags Through the Ages and Across the World,&quot; &quot;The Flag Book of the United States,&quot; and &quot;Flag Lore of all Nations.&quot;

He was the designer of the national flag of Guyana, 21 Saudi Arabian navy flags and served as a vexillographer (flag designer) to a number of governments and organizations. In 1981, Smith was part of a committee that developed the flag of Bonaire and assisted in the design of the flag of Aruba.

Smith also wrote over 250 articles for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

<text>Luck of the Draw is the eleventh studio album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 1991.

After being nominated for Grammy awards in four different categories for the album &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, Raitt went for a creative retreat in Northern California to begin work on &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;. &quot;I did it on purpose to see if I could come up with anything,&quot; Raitt said in 1991. &quot;In case I won, I wanted to make sure that I had done some writing and didn&#x27;t feel that &quot;Nick of Time&quot; was a fluke. I didn&#x27;t want to win just &#x27;cause I quit drinking and spent twenty years not making any money, you know? There wasn&#x27;t enough. So I basically forced myself to go to songwriting boot camp. There were three of four days when it didn&#x27;t happen — but because I didn&#x27;t have alcohol or unhappiness or anything to get in the way, it started to open up and I started three of the four songs of mine that are on this album. And then it didn&#x27;t matter if I won or not, because I had proved to myself that it was okay.&quot;

The album surpassed &quot;Nick of Time&quot;″s commercial success, having sold seven million copies in the United States alone by 2010, and was supported by a 180-date tour from 1991 to 1993. It replicated much of her U.S. success overseas as well, selling two million in France and Italy. It remains Raitt&#x27;s biggest-selling recording to date.

In the liner notes, Raitt dedicated this album to blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who died in 1990 and had encouraged her to stop abusing alcohol, writing: &quot;still burning bright&quot;.

<text>Gerald Ducharme (born March 21, 1939) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1995, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1995.

== Early life and career ==
The son of Jean Louis Ducharme and Mackalena Andreychuk, Ducharme was born in Winnipeg in 1939. He was educated in St. Vital and at the University of Manitoba, and worked as an insurance broker and real estate dealer before entering public life. He was a member of the &quot;Winnipeg Real Estate Board&quot; and the &quot;Manitoba Brokers Association&quot;. He began his political career as a school trustee for the St. Vital School Board and was an alderman in Winnipeg from 1980 to 1986. He married Yvonne Normandeau in 1963.

== Political career ==
Ducharme was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Doreen Dodick in the south-end Winnipeg seat of Riel. The NDP won the election, and Ducharme sat in the opposition benches for the next two years.

The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, and the Progressive Conservatives managed to form a minority government after the election which followed. Ducharme faced a difficult challenge from Liberal Chris Sigurdson, winning by only 324 votes (the Liberals made strong inroads into both Tory and NDP ridings in this cycle). On May 9, 1988, Ducharme was appointed Manitoba Minister of Urban Affairs and Manitoba Minister of Housing.

Liberal support declined in the provincial election of 1990, and Ducharme was re-elected in Riel with an increased majority. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1991, he was named Manitoba Minister of Government Services, responsible for Seniors.

Ducharme resigned from cabinet on March 20, 1995, and was not a candidate in the subsequent election. He has not run for provincial or federal office since this time.

== Post political career ==
In 1998, Ducharme was made Chairman of the Manitoba Municipal Board. He stepped down from this position in 2000, shortly after the NDP under Gary Doer were returned to power.

<doc id="1156714" wikidata="Q7101139" url="?curid=1156714" title="Oregon Coast Trail">
<text>The Oregon Coast Trail (OCT) is a long-distance hiking route along the Pacific coast of the U.S. state of Oregon in the United States. It follows the coast of Oregon from the mouth of the Columbia River to the California border south of Brookings.

The trail was envisioned in 1959 by Samuel N. Dicken, a University of Oregon geography professor, approved in 1971 by the Oregon Recreation Trails Advisory Council and developed and managed by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as part of the state park system of Oregon. The official coastal guide gives a length of . About 39 percent of the route is on the beach, 41 percent is on paved road, and 20 percent is on trail and dirt roads. Private ferries can however be arranged at some estuaries to shortcut road segments. Walked in its entirety, linking each trail/beach section, the distance is approximately 425 miles.

A chief feature of the trail are the public beaches created in 1967 via the Oregon Beach Bill, which formalized the public nature of the coastal beaches since the first such law was passed in 1913. Many of the locations, particularly on the southern portion, are remote and isolated. The Oregon coast is bordered by a temperate rainforest, much of which is now second or third growth.

The difficulty of the trail ranges from easy to moderate, with elevation changes of up to a few hundred feet.

== Route ==

The northern trailhead is at the base of the south jetty of the Columbia River, approximately 4 miles (6 km) north of the campground of Fort Stevens State Park and about 13 miles (21 km) from the city of Astoria. The trail runs north-south along the entire Oregon Coast, following the shore as closely as practical. For many portions of the route, it is beach walking, mostly on sand. In populated areas it often follows the nearest street to the shore. Many parts of the trail leave the beach and take an inland path, usually where land formations make the shoreline impassable, such as at Cape Kiwanda. Some of the rocky headlands are passable on foot at beach level only at low tide. Other headlands are traversed by state park or forest service trails well above the sea. In many other places, the road is the only feasible route, mostly U.S. Route 101. The southern terminus of the trail is the unmarked Oregon/California border on a stretch of beach about south of Brookings, and about half a mile south of the Winchuck River.

Besides headlands, there are numerous rivers and creeks which must be crossed. Most creeks are forded by wading, although sometimes the water can be waist deep even at low tide. At high tide, some are hazardous or impossible to cross and require a boat or a detour to a bridge. Rainfall during winter and early spring decreases the number of streams which are safely fordable.

== Trail-walking information ==
The Oregon Coast Trail (OCT) is a described route and not a continuous trail. Thirty-nine percent of the route is on beaches. Forty-one percent, or more than of the route is on pavement. Twenty percent follows trails. If walked in its entirety (without taking ferries), the total distance is approximately 425 miles. The OCT is signed throughout its length, but in some places signage is not reliable. However it is difficult to become lost since the route is never more than a few miles from a paved road. In 2009, the State of Oregon posted a set of downloadable maps with brief route descriptions.

A dedicated guidebook for the OCT was published in 2015, called Exploring the Oregon Coast Trail. Written by Connie Soper, the book details 40 consecutive day hikes, and also includes maps and logistical information for the entire Oregon Coast Trail, such as tidal considerations and arranging for boat rides. The trail is open to hikers, and in some places, to bicycles, and equestrians (but not the entire route). As portions of the route lead around headlands or cross river mouths that are only passable at low tide, carrying a current tide table and relevant topographic information can be extremely helpful. Sometimes a hiker must choose between waiting for a lower tide or walking inland to avoid high water.

Seasonal recreation restrictions are in place from March 15 through September 15 in some locations to protect shorebird nesting. These restrictions include complete prohibition of dogs, camping, non-motorized vehicles (including bicycles and fat bikes), motorized vehicles, and kites. Hikers and equestrians must also stay on the wet sand. Shorebird areas are clearly marked on the beach with yellow signs.

Many state campgrounds have areas dedicated for hikers and bicyclists at reduced prices (compared to vehicles). Beach camping is allowed where out of sight of residences, not adjacent to state parks, and not near snowy plover during nesting season. This limits camping on some areas of the trail to developed campgrounds, particularly along the northern beaches. Oregon Parks Forever funded the creation and installation of nine Hiker/Biker pods for tent campers in state parks along the coast: They are located in hiker/biker camps at Fort Stevens, Devil’s Lake, Cape Blanco, Harris Beach, Cape Lookout, Bullards Beach, Nehalem Bay, Beverly Beach, Honeyman, and Sunset Bay. The State of Oregon has stated its intention to create more primitive and free camping areas.

Vehicles are allowed on a few beaches. Dune buggies are used extensively in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, a stretch of beach from Florence to Coos Bay.

Several portions of the trail are pristine and secluded, such as the segment from Bandon to Port Orford, where several days of relative solitude and free camping exist.

Prevailing winds are from the northwest which makes the trail easier to hike from north to south. Route descriptions are also written assuming a north to south direction of travel.

Cities and towns of various sizes are located along Highway 101 every permitting re-provisioning on a regular basis. Public transportation is extremely limited along the coast.

<doc id="1156719" wikidata="Q5280439" url="?curid=1156719" title="Direction of fit">
<text>The term direction of fit is used in the philosophy of intentionality to distinguish between types of representations. It is commonly applied in two related senses: first, to distinguish the mental states of belief and desire; and second, to distinguish between types of linguistic utterances, such as indicative and imperative sentences.

First, philosophers of mind distinguish between mind-to-world (i.e., mind-to-fit-world) and world-to-mind (i.e., world-to-fit-mind) directions of fit. In the former, mental states such as beliefs are subject to updates in order to fit evidence provided by the world (the mind changes to fit the world, thus beliefs have a mind-to-world direction of fit). In the latter, mental states such as desires motivate the agent to change the world in order to fit the desired state in the mind (the world changes to fit the mind, thus desires have a world-to-mind direction of fit).

Similarly, philosophers of language, in particular advocates of speech act theory such as John Searle, distinguish between word-to-world and world-to-word directions of fit. In the former, utterances such as indicative sentences attempt to describe the world; for a statement, the state of affairs is considered appropriate if the content expressed by the words fit the way the world really is (a word-to-world direction of fit). In the latter, utterances such as imperative sentences attempt to cause a change in the world; for an order, the state of affairs is considered appropriate when the world changes to fit the words (a world-to-word direction of fit).

In both cases, the issue is how representations are considered satisfactory. Beliefs and descriptive statements are considered satisfactory when the states of affairs they represent match the world; i.e. when they are true. Desires and orders are considered satisfactory when world matches the state of affairs they represent; i.e. when they are fulfilled.

==In general==

In philosophy of mind, a belief has a mind-to-world direction of fit. A belief (that p, say) depicts the world as being in a state of affairs such that p is true. Beliefs, some philosophers have argued, aim at the truth and so aim to fit the world. A belief is satisfied when it fits the world.

A desire, on the other hand, normally expresses a yet to be realized state of affairs and so has a world-to-mind direction of fit. A desire that p, unlike a belief, doesn&#x27;t depict the world as being in the state that p; rather it expresses a desire that the world be such that p is true. Desire is a state that is satisfied when the world fits it.

A way to account for the difference is that a (rational) person that holds the belief that p when confronted with evidence that not-p, will revise his belief, whereas a person that desires that p can retain his desire that p in the face of evidence that not-p.

To a philosopher of language a word-to-world fit occurs when, say, a sports journalist correctly names Jones as a goal scorer; while if the journalist mistakenly names Smith as the goal scorer, the printed account does &quot;not&quot; display a word-to-world fit, and must be altered such that it matches the real world. Conversely, a world-to-word fit occurs when a fan of Smith&#x27;s team opines that they deserved to win the match, even though they lost. In this case, the world would have to change to make the sports fan&#x27;s wish become true.

However, in the case of, say, a judge delivering a death sentence to a criminal declared guilty by a jury, the utterances of the judge &quot;alter&quot; the world, through the fact of that utterance; and, in this case, the judge is generating a world-to-word-to-world fit (see below). So, if the judge&#x27;s opinion is upheld, the world &quot;must&quot; be altered to match the content of the judge&#x27;s utterance (i.e., the criminal must be executed).

==In medieval philosophy==
According to Thomas Aquinas (&quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Part I, Question 21, Article 2), there are two kinds of &quot;truth&quot; (&quot;veritas&quot;), both understood as correspondence between mind (&quot;intellectus&quot;) or words (&quot;oratio&quot;) and world (&quot;things&quot;, &quot;res&quot;):
==In philosophy of language==
Perhaps the first to speak of a &quot;direction of fit&quot; was the philosopher J. L. Austin. Austin did not use the distinction between different directions of fit to contrast commands or expressions of intention to assertions, or desires to beliefs. He rather distinguishes different ways of asserting that an item is of a certain type.

In a detailed analysis of the distinctions between various scenarios, such as (a) mislabeling a triangle as a square (which Austin regarded as an act of linguistic violence) and (b) inaccurately describing a triangular object as a square (which Austin considered an act of factual violence), Austin introduced a conceptual differentiation. He labeled these distinctions as follows:
* &quot;the onus of match&quot;: in the case of one wanting to &quot;match&quot; X and Y, the distinction between the matching of X to Y and the matching of Y to X; and
* &quot;the direction of fit&quot;: in the case of naming something, the difference between the fitting of a name to an item, and the fitting of an item to a name.

The concept of direction of fit can also apply to speech acts: e.g., statements, guesses and conjectures have word-to-world direction of fit, while commands and promises have a world-to-word direction of fit.

John Searle and Daniel Vanderveken assert that there are only four possible &quot;directions of fit&quot; in language:
:1. The word-to-world direction of fit.
:In achieving success of fit the propositional content of the utterance fits an independently existing state of affairs in the world. E.g.: &quot;We are married&quot;.

:2. The world-to-word direction of fit.
:To achieve success of fit the world must change to match the propositional content of the utterance. E.g.: &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;, &quot;I want to marry him&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;d just better marry her, buddy!&quot;, etc.

:3. The double direction of fit.
:To achieve success of fit the world is &quot;thereby&quot; altered to fit the propositional content by representing the world as being so altered, unlike sense 2. E.g.: &quot;I declare you man and wife&quot;. The &#x27;doubled&#x27; direction is therefore always world-to-word-to-world. For obvious reasons, Searle calls sentences of this type &#x27;declarations&#x27;.

:4. The null or empty direction of fit.
:There is no direct question of achieving success of fit between the propositional content and the world, because success of fit is presupposed by the utterance. E.g.: &quot;I&#x27;m glad I married you&quot; presupposes that the speaker is married to the listener.

Searle used this notion of &quot;direction of fit&quot; to create a taxonomy of illocutionary acts.
Although Elizabeth Anscombe never employed the term &quot;the direction of fit&quot;, Searle has strongly argued that the following passage from her work Intention was, by far, &quot;the best illustration&quot; of the distinction between the tasks of &quot;[getting] the words (more strictly their propositional content) to match the world... [and that of getting] the world to match the words&quot;:
==In philosophy of mind==

According to Velleman, when used in the domain of the philosophy of mind, the concept direction of fit represents the distinguishing feature between two types of intentional mental states:

:Facta (singular factum, states that currently exist) are states with a mind-to-world direction of fit.
: Examples include beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and fantasies. In the event of a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the mental state is in some sense false or wrong and should perhaps be changed.

:Facienda (singular faciendum, states that are yet to exist) are states with a world-to-mind direction of fit.
:Examples include intentions and desires. If there is a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the world is in some sense wrong and should perhaps be changed.

In some forms of mind-body dualism, a matching &quot;factum&quot; and &quot;faciendum&quot; must be present in a person&#x27;s mind in order for him to act intentionally. If a person has the belief that action (A) will lead to state (S), and has the desire that state (S) obtain, then he will perform action (A). The action is directly caused by simultaneous presence of the two mental states; no further explanation is needed.

According to Velleman:
::&quot;The term &quot;direction of fit&quot; refers to the two ways in which attitudes can relate propositions to the world.&quot;
::&quot;In cognitive attitudes [such as belief], a proposition is grasped as patterned after the world; whereas in conative attitudes [such as desire], the proposition is grasped as a pattern for the world to follow.&quot;
::&quot;The propositional object of desire is regarded not as fact -- not, that is, as factum, having been brought about -- but rather as faciendum, to be brought about: it&#x27;s regarded not as true but as to be made true.&quot;

Ruth Millikan has also written influentially about representations, noting that many primitive representations used by animals are characterized by a dual direction of fit; she terms such representations &quot;pushmi-pullyu representations.&quot; As an example, she cites the role of bee dances in both informing other bees about the location of resources (indicative, or dance-to-world) and directing their action (imperative, or world-to-dance):

Millikan suggests that many perceptual representations (including those in humans) have such a dual function, both providing an agent information about the state of affairs in the world and suggesting action possibilities to change that state of affairs. She further remarked on the similarity between such representations and the role of affordances in the ecological perception theory of psychologist J. J. Gibson. 

However, Millikan&#x27;s openness to Gibson&#x27;s framework has not been typical of philosophers of mind, and later philosophers such as Bence Nanay have explored the possibility of action-oriented perception without endorsing affordance theory.

The predictive coding framework of neural representations developed by neuroscientist Karl Friston and philosopher Andy Clark has similarly been observed to be an attempt to construe representations with dual direction of fit, uniting predictions (mind-to-world) and actions (world-to-mind).

<text>Collegiate School is an all-boys private school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. Founded by Dutch colonists in either 1628 or 1638, it is the nation&#x27;s oldest private secondary school, and claims to be the nation&#x27;s oldest school without qualification. It educates around 670 boys in grades K–12, with approximately 50–55 students per grade.

It is a member of both the New York Interschool Association and the Ivy Preparatory School League, two groups of New York City secondary schools. 

==History==

=== Establishment and founding date controversy ===
In 1628, the Reverend Jonas Michaëlius, the first minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in America, arrived in the Dutch colony of New Netherland. That August, he wrote to an Amsterdam preacher that he wanted &quot;to place [Native American] students under the instruction of some experienced and godly schoolmaster, where they may be instructed not only to speak, read, and write in our language, but also especially in the fundamentals of our Christian religion.&quot; It appears that some form of Dutch &quot;school&quot; existed on Manhattan no later than 1632, when a marriage contract instructed a husband to &quot;keep [his step-children] at school.&quot;

In August 1637, the Dutch West India Company and the Classis of Amsterdam, the supervising body of the Dutch Reformed Church, licensed Adam Roelantsen to open a state-funded school in Manhattan, which opened in 1638. The school began as a co-ed school located south of Canal Street, but became an all-boys institution at the end of the 19th century.

The school has revised its founding date over the years. The school initially set the founding date at 1633, but later changed it to 1638, as archival research suggested that Roelantsen visited Manhattan in 1633 but was not teaching at that time. In 1982, the New-York Historical Society revealed a 1628 letter from Michaëlius discussing his teaching efforts. Based on this letter, the school announced in 1984 that it was changing the foundation date to 1628, allowing it to (somewhat controversially) claim the title of the oldest school in America. (Boston Latin School, the nation&#x27;s oldest public school, was founded in 1635, and Harvard University, the nation&#x27;s oldest university, was founded in 1636.)

Collegiate asserts continuity with Michaëlius&#x27; tutoring work because &quot;the minister&#x27;s efforts later led to the founding of Collegiate&quot; and Dutch Reformed ministers frequently took on teaching duties in the Dutch colonies. In 2009, a Dutch historian contested Collegiate&#x27;s position and supported the 1638 date, albeit in a summary footnote.

=== Dutch bastion in English New York ===
Collegiate traditionally catered to Manhattan&#x27;s Dutch settler population, even after the English conquest. Under English and later British rule, in the years before free, universal public education, the various religious denominations sponsored schools for their own communities. Collegiate was funded by New York&#x27;s Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, hence the name. (The term &quot;collegiate&quot; refers to a network of churches that &quot;shared ministers and kept a single set of registers.&quot;)

The school stubbornly retained its Dutch identity for over a century after the English conquest. In 1705, it fended off the English colonial governor&#x27;s (Lord Cornbury) attempts to take over the school, after which Cornbury encouraged William Huddleston to establish the Anglican Trinity School in 1709. Classes were conducted exclusively in Dutch until 1773. The school educated only members of the Dutch Reformed Church until 1869, and even after 1869, Dutch Reformed children had an advantage in the admissions process. 

Collegiate gained independence from the Reformed Church in 1808, but retained its association with the Church until 1940, when it became a non-profit corporation. The Church continued to be the school&#x27;s landlord, but charged low rent in exchange for seats on the school&#x27;s board of trustees, an arrangement that lasted until 2015.

Due to the school&#x27;s long history, it has taken on several names, including Charity School of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church and School of the Collegiate Reformed Dutch Church. The school was renamed Collegiate School of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in 1860 and Collegiate Grammar School in 1887. It has also moved 17 times over the last four centuries.

=== Transition to college-preparatory school ===
LeMuel C. Mygatt served as headmaster from 1887 to 1910. Under his leadership, Collegiate – which was challenged by declining financial support from the Collegiate Church – transitioned from a co-educational, tuition-free &quot;charity school&quot; to the present-day all-boys college-preparatory school. In 1887 the school moved uptown from 29th Street to 74th Street and began charging tuition. Tuition for the college-preparatory division was set at $200 a year, a princely sum at a time when Phillips Exeter charged day students $45–60 a year. The school generally stopped admitting girls in 1892, but operated a co-educational kindergarten from 1935 to 1961.

Under Mygatt, the school moved to the 77th Street grounds of the West End Collegiate Church (a division of the broader Collegiate Church) in 1892, where it would remain until 2018. (A 78th Street extension was added in 1968.) The school&#x27;s original building at the West End location was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Collegiate historically catered to an upper-class clientele – in 1972, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;from its inception, Collegiate&#x27;s student body has included the children of some of the best known families in New York&quot; – and its middle school traditionally served as a feeder school to (mostly Eastern) boarding schools with similarly affluent student bodies. However, in the 1960s, the American upper class increasingly leaned towards sending their children to day schools. From 1961 to 1970, the share of Collegiate students who left for boarding school declined from 75% to 9%.

The school also offered an extensive financial aid program. In 1971, nearly a third of Collegiate&#x27;s 518 students were on scholarship.

=== 21st century ===
Collegiate has had six Heads of School (including one interim head) in the 21st century. Kerry P. Brennan, the former head of the Upper School at Ohio&#x27;s University School, led the school from 2000 to 2004, succeeding Jacob Dresden. Following Brennan&#x27;s departure, W. Lee Pierson served as interim head from 2004 to 2006. Lee M. Levison, the former head of Connecticut&#x27;s Kingswood Oxford School, led the school from 2006 to 2020. He was succeeded by David S. Lourie, the former head of Virginia&#x27;s St. Anne&#x27;s-Belfield School, who served from 2020 to 2024. In 2024, Collegiate appointed Bodie Brizendine, the former head of New York&#x27;s Spence School, as its Head of School; she is the first female Head of School in Collegiate&#x27;s history.

On January 12, 2018, Collegiate opened a new 180,000-square foot building on 301 Freedom Place South, in New York&#x27;s Riverside South neighborhood. The school conducted two capital campaigns totaling $100 million to facilitate the move; its chairman had previously estimated the full cost at $125–$135 million. The move took place at the behest of the West End Collegiate Church, the school&#x27;s historic landlord, which wished to raise money by selling the land to property developers for residential condominiums. The Church set Collegiate a 2022 deadline to leave, but the school left several years early. In 2024, the school opened a 10,000-square foot annex space at 50 Riverside Boulevard.

Headmaster David Lourie stepped down in 2024 after four years, following internal disputes about the approach the school should take towards the Israel–Hamas war. The administration&#x27;s official policy is that &quot;the School should not take positions on matters that by their nature include a range of opinions&quot; and should ordinarily refrain from &quot;issuin[g] statements in response to each&quot; act of prejudice in the news. A report noted that &quot;many Jewish parents&quot; believed that the school ought to have issued a statement condemning the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. (Collegiate was not the only New York school to face such turmoil; Fieldston&#x27;s head of school stepped down two months later.)

=== Student body ===
In the 2021–22 school year, Collegiate reported that of its 662 students, 326 (49.2%) were white, 119 (18.0%) were Asian, 22 (3.3%) were Hispanic, 47 (7.1%) were Black, and 148 (22.4%) were multiracial. The school was not permitted to include students in two or more categories.

The school is divided into Lower School (Kindergarten–Grade 4), Middle School (Grades 5–8), and Upper School (Grades 9–12). Each grade contains approximately 50–55 students. Those who attend Collegiate for all 12 years are nicknamed &quot;Survivors&quot;.

== Academics and reputation ==
The school had a 5.9:1 student-teacher ratio in 2024. The faculty is highly educated: in 2018, the school stated that 16% of its teachers had a doctorate and 59% had at least a master&#x27;s degree. In 2024 the school stated that 32.7% of its 113 teachers identified as people of color.

=== Rankings and college attendance ===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Collegiate is &quot;small yet fiercely competitive,&quot; and &quot;is renowned in private school circles for its academic rigor – its college placement list is the envy of many.&quot; Collegiate has been recognized in several lists of schools that send their students to selective universities.

* 2002: &quot;Worth&quot; magazine ranked Collegiate #3 in the nation for sending students to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton. Between 1998 and 2001, 20.0% of Collegiate graduates matriculated at one of these three schools.
* 2008: &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ranked Collegiate #1 in the nation for sending students to eight selective colleges and universities.
* 2016: MainStreet ranked Collegiate #2 in the nation for sending students to the Ivy League schools. 40% of Collegiate graduates matriculated at one of these eight schools.

In 2019, Harvard&#x27;s student newspaper reported that from 2011 to 2019, Collegiate was one of twelve high schools (four of which were New York City day schools) with five or more early inductees to Harvard&#x27;s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a distinction that ordinarily implies nearly straight As with &quot;one or two A-minuses.&quot;

==Iconography==
Collegiate&#x27;s iconography has traditionally reflected the school’s status as one of the remaining symbols of the Dutch legacy in New York City. The school&#x27;s sports teams compete as the Collegiate Dutchmen and the school colors are orange and blue, based on the flag of Prince William the Silent. In June 2020, a History and Symbols Task Force issued a lengthy report recommending certain revisions to the school&#x27;s iconography.

=== Seal and mottos ===

Collegiate&#x27;s seal is an adaptation of the coat of arms of William the Silent (better known in the Netherlands, but not the Anglosphere, as William of Orange), who founded the Dutch Republic and the Reformed Church in that country and led the cause of independence and of freedom for the Reformed Church against Philip II of Spain. The school seal traditionally included two mottos: &#x27;, Dutch for &quot;In unity there is strength&quot; (the motto of the Dutch Republic), and &#x27;, Latin for &quot;unless God, then in vain&quot; (from Psalm 127). According to one scholar, the two mottos &quot;served as rallying cries in the long-continued struggle for civil and religious liberty waged by the Netherlands against the power of Spain.&quot;

In 2022, following the Task Force&#x27;s recommendation, the school changed its seal and Latin motto to remove religious references. The new Latin motto is &quot;Communitas, Sapientia, Humanitas&quot; (translated by the school as &quot;Community, Wisdom, Humaneness&quot;). The school also removed the abbreviation &quot;A.D.&quot; (&quot;in the year of our Lord&quot;) from the school seal.

=== Mascot ===
Traditionally, the school&#x27;s mascot was a Dutchman, although depictions of said Dutchman varied. &quot;Pogo&quot; cartoonist Walt Kelly, a Collegiate parent, drew the generally-used version of the mascot in the 1960s. Kelly&#x27;s version was generally interpreted as a caricature of Peter Stuyvesant, and often called &quot;Peg Leg Pete&quot; by students. In the 21st century, the mascot&#x27;s association with Stuyvesant became a subject of controversy because of Stuyvesant&#x27;s lack of religious tolerance, his vision for New Amsterdam as a slave depot, and his anti-Semitism.

Following the Task Force&#x27;s recommendation, the school revised the &quot;Dutchman&quot; mascot to remove overt references to Stuyvesant by obscuring the mascot&#x27;s face and removing the peg leg.

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
Tuition for the 2024–25 academic year is $65,900. The school offers a financial aid program. Although it generally does not disclose the number of scholarship students, it disclosed in 2024 that &quot;nearly 17%&quot; of students were on financial aid. Based on the school&#x27;s $5.6 million financial aid budget in 2024, the average scholarship award is approximately $49,000.

=== Endowment and expenses ===
In 2024, Collegiate disclosed that its endowment stood at $75 million; it was $73.3 million in 2020. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2022–23 school year, Collegiate reported total assets of $350.8 million, net assets of $281.8 million, investment holdings of $73.8 million, and cash holdings of $31.8 million. Collegiate also reported $42.3 million in program service expenses and $5.2 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

== Campus ==
In January 2018, Collegiate moved into a new facility at 301 Freedom Place South. It consists of an 11-story building (nine stories above ground and two below), with of classroom, athletics, theater, music, art, library, dining, and administrative space. The school has common areas dedicated to each division that provide space for independent study, social interactions, and divisional activities.

The Lower School is located on floors 2 and 3. The Middle School occupies floors 8 and 9. It has its own Maker Space, along with flexible classrooms, a Middle School Center and large, modern group study spaces. The Upper School is housed on floors 5 and 6. It is larger than the division&#x27;s previous space and is next to the library. It has flexible classrooms and common areas that promote interaction among students and faculty.

Sciences for all three divisions are on floor 7. Visual arts and music occupy floor 4, with music practice spaces, art studios, and a digital photo lab. On the Lower Level is a 307-seat auditorium and a black-box theater for Collegiate&#x27;s drama program. Collegiate&#x27;s athletics are in the Lower Level and include a high school regulation-size gym for the basketball teams. The gym can be partitioned to provide PE classes and practice space simultaneously. An additional gym, the Alumni Gym, can accommodate wrestling competitions and half-court basketball and has a retractable batting cage.

Outdoor space consists of a large roof deck on floor 9 with a large recreation area and a ground-level, 5,000-square-foot courtyard for handball and basketball.

==Sports and co-curricular activities==
The school&#x27;s athletic success has mainly been with the varsity basketball, baseball, track and field, soccer, and cross country teams. The Collegiate soccer team won the NYSAIS state championship in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The Collegiate varsity basketball team won five straight state championships in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Collegiate cross country team won 25 Ivy League Championships in a row from 1990 to 2014. The Collegiate wrestling team won their first Ivy League and NYSAIS titles in 2022. Collegiate also has a golf and tennis team. Students not participating in a sport take physical education. Yearly fitness tests are administered in the lower and middle schools.

The school has a number of clubs, especially in the Upper School, including &quot;The Collegiate Journal&quot;. its newspaper operating since 1932; &quot;The Dutchman&quot;, the yearbook published every year since 1906; and &quot;Prufrock&quot;. its literary magazine, first published in 1973.

<text>A gas cracker is any device that splits the molecules in a gas or liquid, usually by electrolysis, into atoms. The end product is usually a gas. A hydrocracker is an example of a gas cracker. In nature, molecules are split often, such as in food digestion and microbial digestion activity. A gas cracker device splits the molecule at a rate much greater than that normally found in nature. In science and industry, gas crackers are used to separate two or more elements in a molecule. For example, liquid water, or , is separated into hydrogen and oxygen gases. This is not to be confused with the splitting of the nucleus (nuclear power).

==Gas cracker==
Petrochemicals are usually manufactured in large scale from petroleum feed stocks using fluid catalytic cracking. Naphtha, natural gas, refinery off-gas and gas from cokers and thermal crackers are good sources. Thus natural gas is one of the most wanted feed stocks for petrochemicals production. The thermal cracking of natural gas proceeds at very high temperature resulting in olefins (Mostly ethylene/propylene). The temperature in a gas cracker exceeds 1000°C. For ultimate decomposition of gas into elements more than 1500 °C is required. Thus, acetylene/carbon black production encounters such high temperatures. Usually oxy-combustion methods are used for attaining such high temperatures. BASF burners/Kellog burners are available in the market. 

==Other methods==
Further electro cracking or plasma cracking methods are also available.

<text>Pedro Rodríguez de la Vega (18 January 1940 – 11 July 1971) was a Mexican racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Rodríguez won two Formula One Grands Prix across nine seasons. In endurance racing, Rodríguez won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Ford, and was a two-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona with Porsche. 

Born and raised in Mexico City, Rodríguez was the older brother of racing driver Ricardo Rodríguez, who became the first Mexican driver to compete in Formula One in 1961. Both brothers started racing at an early age, first on motorbikes and then moving to cars. Following his brother&#x27;s death in a racing accident in 1962, Pedro briefly considered retiring from racing, but decided to carry on. In sportscar racing his first major win was with his brother in the 1961 Paris 1000km, driving a Ferrari 250 GT. He began his Formula One career in 1963, won the 1967 South African Grand Prix in a Cooper and the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix in a BRM. He won the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Ford GT40 and won eight races in the Porsche 917 across 1970 and 1971.

In July 1971, Rodríguez was killed at the Norisring in West Germany, driving a Ferrari 512 M in an Interserie sportscar race.

== Personal life==

Rodríguez was born in Mexico City, Mexico, the second son of Pedro Natalio Rodríguez and Concepción De la Vega. He had an older sister, Conchita, and three younger brothers: Ricardo, Federico (died at two months of age) and Alejandro.

At 15, his father sent him to Western Military Academy in Alton, Illinois, in order to learn English and to develop more discipline.

The Rodríguez brothers raced bicycles and motorcycles, becoming Mexican national motorcycle champions in 1953 and 1954. Pedro made his international debut in cars at Nassau in 1957 in a Ferrari.

He married Angelina (&quot;née&quot; Damy), in Mexico in 1961, although he had a girlfriend in England, Glenda Foreman, with whom he lived in Bray on Thames in his later years, but left no children.

Rodríguez always traveled with a Mexican flag and a record of the national anthem because when he won the 1967 South African GP the organizers did not have the Mexican anthem, and instead played the Mexican hat dance.

Jo Ramírez was a very close friend to both Rodríguez and his younger brother, Ricardo.

==Career==

Rodríguez began racing with bicycles at eight years old. He was a class winner in the Mexican Championship by 1950. He started racing a Adler motorcycle, winning Mexico&#x27;s national championship in 1952 and 1954. In 1952, he entered a rally in a Ford, but achieved little. He returned to racing full-time in 1955, at 15, entering a Jaguar XK120 or Porsche 1600S in local contests.

At the end of 1957, Rodríguez (who had been driving a Chevrolet Corvette in Mexico) and his brother entered the Nassau Speed Week competition, where the wild-driving elder brother wrecked his Ferrari 500 TR.

The 18-year-old Rodríguez shared a 500 TR at Le Mans, entered by U.S. importer Luigi Chinetti, with José Behra, brother of Jean Behra, as his co-driver; the car did not finish, after a radiator hose puncture. Rodríguez came back every year to Le Mans, fourteen times in total, and won in 1968, co-driving with Belgian Lucien Bianchi, sharing a Ford GT40 for the JW–Gulf team.

At the Reims 12-hours in 1958, Rodríguez and Behra placed second in class (eighth overall) in their Porsche Carrera, while Rodríguez came second in a Ferrari 250 TR at Nassau at the end of the season.

Rodríguez went to Europe to race starting in 1959, sharing a Porsche 1600 S with Leo Levine at the Nurbürgring 1000 km, which came in second in class (thirteenth overall). He shared a O.S.C.A. with his brother for Le Mans, which broke.

At Cuba&#x27;s 1960 Liberty Grand Prix, Rodríguez&#x27;s 250TR followed Stirling Moss&#x27;s winning Maserati &quot;Tipo&quot; 61 home, in second. At Sebring, his Dino 196 S failed to finish. Rodríguez claimed seventh at the 1960 Targa Florio, again in the 196 S, which spent time off the pavement as well as on. He retired from that year&#x27;s Nürburgring 1000 km, and from Le Mans.

In 1961, Rodríguez entered Formula Junior. He returned also to Sebring, sharing a 250TR with his brother which suffered electrical trouble and came third. The duo also failed to finish that year&#x27;s Targa Florio or Nürburgring 1000 km, but did win the Paris 1000 km. An ongoing duel with the works Ferraris at Le Mans, which ultimately resulted in engine failure only two hours from the end, attracted the attention of Enzo Ferrari, who offered them Formula One rides with his team. Pedro declined, having &quot;a motor business in Mexico City to run&quot;.

Despite his refusal, Rodríguez kept racing, and in 1962 entered at Sebring, the Nürburgring, and Le Mans, but failed to finish each time. He won at Bridgehampton, in a Ferrari 330 TRI/LM, and shared a 250 GTO with his brother to win the Paris 1000 km, the second year in a row.
After Ferrari refused to enter the 1962 Mexican Grand Prix, the first to be held in Mexico, Rodríguez and his younger brother both found rides of their own. After his brother was killed in a horrific accident in practice, Rodríguez withdrew. He considered retiring from racing. However, in 1963 he won the Daytona Continental in a 250GTO entered by North American Racing Team. He came third at Sebring, sharing a 330TR/LM with Graham Hill. He failed to qualify at Indianapolis, in an Aston Martin-powered Cooper T54, but took part in his first Grand Prix in the works Lotus at Watkins Glen and Magdalena Mixhuca. Rodríguez failed to finish both times.

Also in 1963, driving for Kjell Qvale Racing, he won his second USRRC ( FIA Group 7 cars) event in the Huffaker chassis#2 Mk8 GENIE/Chevrolet, then went on to win again in their chassis#3 Mk8 GENIE/Ford 

For 1964, he again won the Daytona Continental, as well as the sports car Canadian Grand Prix, was second at the Paris 1000 km, and third in the Bahamas Tourist Trophy. In single-seater racing, he recorded a sixth in the Ferrari 156 at Mexico.

In 1965, his Lotus 33-Climax was fourth at the &quot;Daily Express&quot; Silverstone Trophy, fifth at the U.S. Grand Prix and seventh in the Mexican Grand Prix in a Ferrari. He won the Reims 12-Hours in a Ferrari 365 P2 he shared with Jean Guichet, and scored a third at the Canadian Sports Car Grand Prix.

He drove again for Lotus in four events in 1966, retiring on every occasion. He also deputised for Jim Clark in the Formula Two event at Rouen.
At the start of the 1967 season, Rodríguez won for the first time in only his ninth Grand Prix, at Kyalami. This was the first ever Grand Prix win for a Mexican driver. Cooper manager Roy Salvadori allowed Rodríguez to drive the practice car, over the objections of teammate Jochen Rindt, who had demanded Rodríguez&#x27;s car, with strong support from Rindt&#x27;s close friend Jackie Stewart. Rodríguez&#x27;s smooth, consistent driving earned him victory after Denny Hulme had had a lengthy pit stop and local privateer John Love&#x27;s Tasman Cooper needed a late fuel stop. Rindt, by contrast, retired the other Cooper-Maserati after 38 laps. Rodríguez drove a controlled season in 1967 as No. 2 to Rindt. Though usually slower than his teammate, he built up experience in the older and heavier T81, while Rindt was given the improved T81B and later the brand new T86. A mid-season accident in a Protos-Ford, at the Formula Two event at Enna, sidelined him for three Grand Prix. Rodríguez was only marginally slower than Rindt in the Dutch Grand Prix, also the only other race in the season where the Coopers were competitive.

His performance at Zandvoort earned Rodríguez a better drive with BRM in 1968. Rodríguez proved himself excellent in the wet at Zandvoort and Rouen where he got his only fastest lap in F1 during the French GP. Lack of power meant he had to settle for second behind Bruce McLaren during the Belgian GP at Francorchamps.

The BRM P133 faded through the year from lack of testing time after the death of Mike Spence, whom the team&#x27;s owners favoured. Nevertheless, Rodríguez led the Spanish Grand Prix from Chris Amon for 28 laps until he made a mistake and spun off. At the end of the year, despite Rodríguez&#x27;s good performances, BRM team manager Louis Stanley released Rodríguez to the Parnell BRM privateer team.

The Reg Parnell Racing BRMs proved to have hopeless engines, and after Monaco, Rodríguez left and signed for Ferrari for the remainder of the 1969 Grand Prix and sports car series.

Reentering F1 in the British Grand Prix, Rodríguez matched teammate Amon&#x27;s pace in practice and led Amon by a whisker in the race. The uncompetitive 312s ran midfield until Rodríguez&#x27;s car broke and Amon&#x27;s engine blew for the second race in a row. Given the hopelessness of the 312 V12, the frustration of his drivers, and the slow progress with getting the new flat-12 F1 car ready, Enzo Ferrari would rather have run two Italian drivers for the rest of the season, but the Brambilla brothers, Vittorio and Ernesto, proved too slow. So, Ferrari ran Rodríguez in the last four races of the season, in NART American racing colours for the North American races, but still, effectively, as a Ferrari works team. All in all, Rodríguez managed a fourth place in 1968; sixth in 1964, 1967 and 1970; and seventh in 1965 and 1969; while retiring in 1963 and 1966; in his eight home races in Mexico, but Ferrari didn&#x27;t offer him a ride for 1970.

BRM only offered him a ride in 1970 after John Surtees decided to leave to set up his own team at the last minute. For most of 1970, Stanley clearly favoured Jackie Oliver as number one driver, perhaps partly in response to Stewart&#x27;s opinion of Rodríguez and possibly because of his &quot;old-boys&#x27; club&quot; of Englishmen at the team. At Francorchamps, Rodríguez won with his BRM P153 over the new March of Chris Amon by just 1.1 seconds and with an average speed of 149.94 mph (241.31 km/h), then the highest average speed in the history of F1, Jean-Pierre Beltoise got the third place in a Matra.

The power of the V12 engines was particularly suited to the fast circuits with few really slow corners, such as Francorchamps, Monza, and to a degree Brands Hatch and the Nürburgring, and that was usually the case with the BRM, Matra, and Weslake engined cars. A strong drive at Circuit Mont-Tremblant saw him finish 4th. Only the need to pit in the last laps for fuel robbed him of a victory at Watkins Glen, the highest paying event of the year at the time (US$50,000).The winner was Emerson Fittipaldi, who won his first race in F1.

After many years racing for Ferrari in the World Championship of Makes for sports cars, he signed for JW-Gulf-Porsche in 1970 and over the next two years won eight races driving a Porsche 917, contributing to Porsche winning in the World Sportscar Championship.

Rodríguez developed into one of the sport&#x27;s great all-rounders, racing CanAm, NASCAR, rallies and even becoming North American Ice Racing champion in 1970, invited by the Alaska Sports Car Club from Anchorage, the race was in Sand Lake.

Rodríguez debuted in NASCAR at Trenton Speedway in 1959, finishing 6th. At the 1963 Firecracker 400 he qualified 9th but retired after an engine failure. The Mexican finished 5th in the 1965 World 600, his best result. At the 1971 Daytona 500 he finished 13th. His last NASCAR race was Miller High Life 500, where he retired early with electrical issues

Rodríguez drove a Ferrari 312 P Coupé in the CanAm round of Bridgehampton in 1969, finishing 5th. In 1970 he finished 3rd at Riverside and 5th at Laguna Seca Raceway with a factory BRM P154.

The 1971 Formula One season could have seen him as a championship contender, with a BRM P160 being prepared by Tony Southgate, and for once BRM had consistently good engines. BRM, however, was overextended, trying to run three, and later four, cars. Rodríguez challenged Jacky Ickx in the rain during the Dutch Grand Prix, and only just failed to win.
==Death==
Rodríguez was killed in an Interserie sports car race at Norisring in Nuremberg, West Germany, on 11 July 1971. Rodríguez was at the wheel of a Ferrari 512 M of Herbert Müller Racing, his friend and teammate at the Targa Florio in 1971.
A contemporary source reported that trackside photographers noticed his right front tyre coming away from the rim under heavy braking for the sharp s-bend as early as the 10th lap. On lap 12, the tyre came off completely, sending the car into a wall before rebounding across the track and catching fire. He died shortly after he was extracted from the wreck.

==Legacy==
Rodríguez was considered the best driver of his era in the wet. Along with Jo Siffert, he was considered the bravest driver in motorsport, an example of this being the two touching through the then-very narrow and very dangerous Eau Rouge corner in the rain in their 917s at the start of the 1970 1000km of Spa-Francorchamps.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Rodríguez was ranked the 24th-best Formula One driver of all time.

After winning the LMP2 class at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, the first class victory for a Mexican driver since Rodríguez, Ricardo González recognized Rodríguez as his hero.

==Commemoration==
The first hairpin at Daytona International Speedway (the right-hand hairpin) is named the Pedro Rodríguez curve. In 1973 the Mexico City race track Magdalena Mixuhca, where F1, Champ Car, NASCAR and other series race was renamed for him and Ricardo: Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (Rodríguez Brothers Autodrome).

In July 2006, a bronze plaque was placed at the site of his crash in Nuremberg, a joint effort by &quot;Scuderia Rodríguez&quot; (the friends foundation) and the city authorities. Its Secretary General, Carlos Jalife, published the Rodríguez brothers&#x27; biography in December 2006, with an English translation which won the Motor Press Guild Book of the Year award in 2009.

Sergio Pérez wore a specially-designed crash helmet tributing Pedro Rodríguez for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix in which he went on to claim his third win in Formula One. The helmet featured Rodríguez&#x27;s helmet colours and, on the top, Rodríguez&#x27;s and Perez&#x27;s combined wins and podiums before Perez&#x27;s victory in the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, as the only two Mexican Formula One drivers to achieve race victories. Below the statistics was written &quot;AND COUNTING&quot; and the phrase &quot;GRACIAS PEDRO&quot; (thank you Pedro) below that.

== BRM P153 ==

In 2024, the Mexican driver Adrián Fernández acquired the BRM P153 with which Rodríguez won the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix from a private collector.

<doc id="1156759" wikidata="Q544352" url="?curid=1156759" title="Alto flute">
<text>The alto flute is an instrument in the Western concert flute family, pitched below the standard C flute and the uncommon flûte d&#x27;amour. It is the third most common member of its family after the standard C flute and the piccolo. It is characterized by its rich, mellow tone in the lower portion of its range. The bore of the alto flute is considerably larger in diameter and longer than the C flute and requires a larger column of air (volume of air) from the player, though it also requires a slower airspeed. This gives it a greater dynamic presence in the bottom octave and a half of its range. Its range is from G3 (the G below middle C) to G6 (4 ledger lines above the treble clef staff) plus an altissimo register stretching to D♭7. It uses the same fingerings as the C flute and piccolo, but is a transposing instrument in G (sounding a perfect fourth lower than written).

British music that uses this instrument often refers to it as a bass flute, which can be confusing since there is a distinct instrument known by that name. This naming confusion originated in the fact that the modern flute in C is pitched in the same range as the Renaissance tenor flute; therefore, a lower pitched instrument would be called a bass.

== History ==
While there is no exact date that the alto flute was created, large flutes have existed for several hundred years. Some problems with early alto flute design included the long length of the tube, troublesome cross fingerings, inconsistent intonation, finger holes that were too wide across, and how far one’s arm had to be stretched in order to reach the finger holes, particularly in the left hand. The greatest innovations to the alto flute were developed by Theobald Boehm in the 1850’s when he made the alto flute in G, and it was said to be his favorite flute. There is some research that shows this happened in the mid 1850’s, around 1854-55, when he was 60 years old. The creation of this alto flute was to rid other lower pitch flutes of their current problems. The new flute design by Boehm had rational key systems and levers that were created in order to shorten the length that fingers needed to stretch. New changes were also made in modification to the bore size of the flute in order to support the low register of G. Along with the bore size, the placement and sizes of the keys were changed to complement the new, larger bore.

The first widely produced alto flute was created by Rudall Carte &amp; Co. in London, 1891. They took many of Boehm’s ideas and adjustments to create their alto flute. This alto flute was the lowest flute in the family just under “Bass Flute G”.

== Design and construction ==
Like other Western flutes, the alto flute is constructed of three main parts: the head-joint, the body joint, and the foot joint. Those pieces include an embouchure hole, tone holes, keys, and the mechanism that operates the keys. The head-joint may be straight or curved; curved head-joints are often made in two parts. The straight head-joint is easier to play in tune in the high register due to its true conical bore shape, which is not possible with a curved head-joint. However, the curved head-joint could be a better option for those flutists who have smaller arms and/or smaller hands; it is frequently preferred by smaller players because it requires less of a stretch for the arms, and makes the instrument feel lighter by moving the center of gravity nearer to the player. The head joint is slightly tapered (conical bore) to accomplish precise tonal quality and it includes an embouchure hole. The body and foot joint of the alto flute are composed of either closed hole or open hole keys. Most alto flutes are made with closed hole keys; the Kingma system alto flutes are available with open holes. Open holed alto flutes have more possibilities for extended techniques.

=== Size ===

The alto flute along with the other low flutes are constructed at a longer length than the concert flute; the larger the flute, the lower its pitch. The alto flute is about 1 inch in diameter and 34 inches in length. This compared to the concert flute makes it ¼ of an inch wider in diameter and almost 8 inches longer in length (these measurements may vary depending on the type of head-joint—curved or straight—and whether or not a person is measuring the overall length of the flute or the sounding length of the flute, which is the length measured from the middle of the embouchure hole to the end of the flute). The tone holes on the alto flute are slightly smaller than those of the modern concert flute, relative to its size. According to page 26 of &quot;The Extended Alto Flute: The History and Development of the Alto Flute, with a Study of Modern Alto Flute Design and Its Effect on Extended Techniques in Alto Flute Repertoire and Pedagogical Materials&quot;, a dissertation by graduate student John Edward Davis, &quot;the averaged and converted alto flutes show that their tone holes are relatively smaller compared to the c-flute&quot;. The arrangement of the holes can differ depending on the maker of the flute.

The embouchure-hole for alto flute is similar to that for C flute, but in proportion to the size of the instrument. Hence the embouchure-hole sits lower on the lower lip, and the lip-aperture is wider.

==Repertoire==
Music written for alto flute includes but is not limited to music for alto flute alone, for alto flute and piano, for alto flute and mixed ensembles of many different instruments, and flute choir music. It also appears in orchestral music and film soundtracks.

===Orchestral excerpts===
In the classical literature, the alto flute is particularly associated with the scores of Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, and Gustav Holst, namely in &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, and &quot;The Planets&quot; respectively. 

The alto flute is also called for in Franco Alfano&#x27;s opera &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Scythian Suite&quot; and the original version of Webern&#x27;s &quot;Six Pieces for Orchestra&quot;. Shostakovich used it in his operas &quot;The Gamblers&quot; (left unfinished), &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; (also known as &quot;Katerina Ismailova&quot;), as well as in his &quot;Symphony No. 7 (Leningrad)&quot;. Olivier Messiaen used it in his only opera, &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot;, as well as some of his later concert works, such as &quot;Éclairs sur l&#x27;Au-Delà...&quot; and &quot;Des Canyons aux étoiles...&quot;. It also appears in Howard Shore&#x27;s music for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; among many other contemporary film scores. Even before 1940 it had been used occasionally in Hollywood; early Broadway pit orchestrations using the instrument include Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (1932) and &quot;Very Warm for May&quot; (1939), both scored by Robert Russell Bennett (the manuscript orchestrations are in the Jerome Kern Collection, Music Division, The Library of Congress).

== Performers and pioneers ==
A number of specialist alto flute players emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries. These include French improvisor/composer Christian Le Delezir, American Christine Potter, American Paige Long, British Kingma System alto flute player Carla Rees, jazz players Ali Ryerson and Brian Landrus, American Peter Sheridan who currently resides in Australia, Swiss composers/performers Matthias Ziegler and Stefan Keller and Dutch composer/performer Anne La Berge. Florian Schneider-Esleben of the German Electronic Group, Kraftwerk, played an alto flute in the first few years of the band&#x27;s tenure.

=== Christine Potter ===
Christine Potter established a connection with the alto flute while she was studying at the university of New Mexico. As she became more experienced with the flute and fell more in love with the instrument, she began to compile a repertoire of music and publishers that included parts for the alto flute. At this point, she had such a repertoire that she wanted to make sure that her findings were available online to people who were also interested in playing the instrument. In doing so, she was connected with other flute players like Carla Rees, and the two specialists put their information together and created a compiled list of music. Potter had the opportunity to perform at a convention in Chicago showing how the alto flute could be considered a low solo instrument. This was received very well and Potter was invited to perform with different concertos around the country. At a 2012 Las Vegas Convention, Potter performed the world premiere of a low flute ensemble that she had been working on with other low flute specialists. The performance garnered excellent feedback from the audience, inspiring Potter to reach out to other performers and music composers around the world to perform her own and other peoples pieces. Potter has commissioned thirteen pieces since then that feature the low flute as well as produced a number of her own arrangements and compositions. She holds the distinction of being the initial individual to chair the National Flute Association Low Flutes Committee and pioneered what is called the International Low Flutes Festival in Washington D.C, bringing flutists of all skill levels and age together to give the low flute center stage of their performances. This along with conducting many competitions, Potter has been an important performer and pioneer in the generation of usage of the alto flute as well as the study of the alto and other low flutes.

=== Paige Long ===
Paige Long initially played violin in a faculty orchestra in her place of employment. She was offered a position to play piccolo and took the position to open up new opportunities for her. She was offered a flute teaching position a year later. Whilst in this position, Long started a flute choir to attract more people and was allowed to purchase an alto flute and a bass flute. The choir became very popular, but she knew she needed to improve the quality of the lower sound. She attended a convention where she heard a low flute ensemble, and becoming more interested, she intended to gather more low flutes for her own ensembles. At a convention three years later, Long had the opportunity to purchase the first alto flute in all of North and South America. Paige Long spent many years and much money to try and incorporate the low flute into many ensembles, and is one of the biggest advocates of the low flute in music.

<text>The bass flute is a member of the flute family pitched one octave below the concert flute. The tubing length is twice as long at , which requires a J-shaped head joint to bring the embouchure hole within reach of the player. Despite its name, its lowest note of C or B places its lowest octave only in the tenor range. Its soft dynamic range means in large ensembles it is easily obscured unless amplified or lightly scored; however its unique timbre in the low register can be very effective, especially in solo works, small ensembles, and flute choirs.
The &quot;bass flute in F&quot; produced by Kotato &amp; Fukushima is a contra-alto flute.

==Alternative terminology==
Prior to the mid-20th century, the term &quot;bass flute&quot; was sometimes used, especially in Great Britain, to refer to the alto flute; for example, the part for &quot;bass flute in G&quot; in Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, and many works by Britten. In 1910, Abelardo Albisi invented a bass flute known as the albisiphone which was used in scores by Mascagni and Zandonai among other composers during the first half of the 20th century.

==Range and construction==
The instrument&#x27;s sounding range is from C3 (or B2 if a B Foot Joint), one octave below middle C, to C6, two octaves above middle C. Bass flute music sounds an octave lower than it is written, which is the typical concert flute range (C4 to C7). Notes written above A6 are not often used as they are difficult to produce and have inferior tone unless the instrument is tapered through the curve. Because manufacturers do not taper the flute body through the curve, intonation of all notes beginning with written D6 and higher tends to be sharp. The player can bend them in tune with the embouchure, or use alternative fingerings.
Bass flutes often have a C foot rather than the B foot common to other flutes. The shorter tube reduces acoustic resistance, which quickens the response and makes the tone brighter, livelier, and more resonant. The shorter tube also makes the instrument somewhat lighter and less fatiguing for the player to hold.

Bass flutes are most often made with silver-plated bodies and head joints. Most basses come with trill keys which allow the player to stabilize some otherwise unstable middle register notes as well as trill between otherwise impossible notes. Kotato basses have addressed the weight problem of bass flutes by designing a graphite rod that screws onto the underside of the instrument and then rests on the chair seat between the player&#x27;s legs. Adjustable rods have also been developed by Jeff Amos. Other manufacturers have added a left hand thumb support called a &quot;crutch&quot;, which helps some players with physical control of the instrument. Dutch flute maker Eva Kingma has created a vertical design for the bass flute which allows the weight of the instrument to be supported by the floor.

==Repertoire==
Many composers are beginning to write more pieces for the bass flute. These include Katherine Hoover&#x27;s &quot;Two for Two&quot;, Bill Douglas&#x27;s &quot;Karuna&quot;, Sophie Lacaze&#x27;s &quot;Archelogos II&quot;, Mike Mower&#x27;s &quot;Obstinato&quot; and &quot;Scareso&quot;, Gary Schocker&#x27;s &quot;A Small Sonata for a Large Flute&quot;, Lorenzo Ferrero&#x27;s &quot;Ellipse&quot; and &quot;Shadow Lines&quot;, Sonny Burnett&#x27;s &quot;Stone Suite&quot;, Catherine McMichael&#x27;s &quot;Baikal Journey&quot; and Ennio Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of the Sahara&quot;. Other important works include Tristan Murail&#x27;s &quot;Ethers&quot; for solo bass flute and small ensemble, Brian Ferneyhough&#x27;s &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; for bass flute and tape, Mario Lavista&#x27;s &quot;Lamento a la muerte de Raúl Lavista&quot; for solo bass flute, Michael Oliva&#x27;s &quot;Moss Garden&quot; also for bass flute and tape, John Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Inwards&quot; for bass flute and live-electronics, &quot;She Cried&quot; by Shiva Feshareki, and Marc Tweedie&#x27;s &quot;Zoli&quot;, written for renowned flautist Carla Rees. Studies and concert etudes are beginning to appear that address the instrument&#x27;s many challenges (physical balance, finger technique, air stream, overblowing, etc.). Low flute specialist Peter Sheridan has commissioned and arranged new compositions in this area, including a set of &#x27;Etudes for Low Flutes&#x27; by Hilary Taggart. The sixth movement of Claude Bolling&#x27;s &quot;Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio&quot;, &#x27;Versatile&#x27; has the soloist playing the opening melody on a bass flute. Morton Feldman&#x27;s composition &quot;Crippled Symmetry&quot; has a part for the bass flute, as does John Cage&#x27;s late work &quot;Seven2&quot;. Hans Pfitzner&#x27;s 1917 opera &quot;Palestrina&quot; features an early (true) C bass flute part. Another piece featuring the bass flute is John Mackey&#x27;s &quot;The Frozen Cathedral&quot; (2013) in two separate sections of the piece.

For an extensive list of repertoire for bass flute and contrabass flute see &quot;Repertoire Catalogue for Piccolo, Alto Flute and Bass Flute&quot; (2004) by Peter van Munster (Roma: Riverberi Sonori). Selected repertoire graded into ability levels with short descriptions and information about basses can be found in &quot;The Alto and Bass Flute Resource Guide&quot; published by Falls House Press, and specialist low flutes publishing company Tetractys has a growing catalogue of works for bass flute.

==Other use==
A handful of jazz musicians have used the bass flute, including flutist Jeremy Steig, beginning with his 1975 album Temple of Birth, saxophonists Henry Threadgill, Brian Landrus, and James Carter, and drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson who occasionally played bass flute as a second instrument. Hubert Laws features the bass flute on his recording of &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot; in which he plays the first verse on bass flute, the second on alto, and the third on soprano. Steig later took up the Kotato &amp; Fukushima bass flute in F.

In electronic music, Jack Dangers has sometimes used bass flute as the leader of the Meat Beat Manifesto.

A bass flute is heard throughout George Bruns&#x27; score for &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and the original Pirates of the Caribbean attraction.

Perhaps the best-known work to feature the bass flute is the album &quot;Wave&quot; by Antônio Carlos Jobim.

The soundtrack of Guerrilla Games&#x27; &quot;Horizon Forbidden West&quot; features bass flute prominently, such as in &quot;By The Cold Light of Stars&quot;, &quot;As Certain as Stone&quot; and &quot;These Stones Unturned&quot;.

<text>The United States Department of Defense Office of Force Transformation (OFT) was established October 29, 2001 in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called for the creation of this new office to support his transformation vision along with President George W. Bush’s broad mandate to transform U.S. military capabilities. The transformation process intends to challenge the status quo with new concepts for American defense to ensure an overwhelming and continuing competitive advantage. The Director, Force Transformation serves as advocate, focal point, and catalyst for transformation among the Department, reporting directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense.

On October 1, 2006, the Office of Force Transformation was disestablished, and its functions spread between the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
==Leadership==
Vice Admiral (ret.) Arthur K. Cebrowski (often called the &quot;Godfather&quot; of Network Centric Warfare) was appointed by the Secretary of Defense as the 1st Director, Force Transformation, October 29, 2001 to February 2, 2005, a position which reported directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense. Terry J. Pudas became the Acting Director until October 1, 2006, when he became the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Forces Transformation and Resources.

==Defense Transformation==
OFT transformation plan includes changing the force and its culture from the bottom up through large amounts of experimentation, increased sharing of new knowledge and experiences, and by broadening military capabilities while mitigating risk. One of the pillar theories driving OFT is Network Centric Warfare (NCW), also known as Network Centric Operations, which according to OFT is a theory of war in the Information Age and the organizing principle for national military planning and joint concepts, capabilities, and systems.

According to Cebrowski, &quot;[Defense] Transformation is foremost a continuing process. It does not have an end point. Transformation is meant to create or anticipate the future. Transformation is meant to deal with the co-evolution of concepts, processes, organizations and technology. Change in any one of these areas necessitates change in all. Transformation is meant to create new competitive areas and new competencies. Transformation is meant to identify, leverage and even create new underlying principles for the way things are done. Transformation is meant to identify and leverage new sources of power. The overall objective of these changes is simply—sustained American competitive advantage in warfare.&quot;

The Defense Department&#x27;s April 2003 &quot;Transformation Planning Guidance&quot; document defines &quot;transformation&quot; as &quot;a process that shapes the changing nature of military competition and cooperation through new combinations of concepts, capabilities, people, and organizations that exploit out nation&#x27;s advantages and protect against our asymmetric vulnerabilities to sustain our strategic position, which helps underpin peace and stability in the world.&quot;

OFT engaged in several project aimed at transforming the Defense Department through experimentation within exercises. Some of its major projects included Operationally Responsive Space and Stiletto, and it produced strategies that helped to form DeVenCI. OFT was also engaged in funding projects and developing concepts for reconstruction and stabilization as early as 2003.

==What sets OFT apart==
According to OFT, they:
* Are the only office solely dedicated to transformation;
* Strive to link creativity to implementation;
* Work at the intersection of unarticulated needs and non-consensual change;
* Identify and manage disruptive innovation;
* Work outside the normal course of business activities;
* Entrepreneurial mindset;
* Use concept-technology pairing to explore; and
* Experiment with new ways of operating.

The cartoon series stars two mice, the bow-tied Pixie (voiced by Don Messick) and the vested Dixie (voiced by Daws Butler), and Mr. Jinks the cat (also voiced by Butler) who is always outfoxed by the mice, causing him to utter his trademark line &quot;I hate meeces to pieces!&quot; The show&#x27;s plot itself and its characters followed the same basic concept as &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, the film series Hanna-Barbera had developed for MGM; because Hanna-Barbera were constrained by the smaller budgets for television, &quot;Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks&quot; emphasized verbal humor to compensate for the more limited animation compared to the more physical comedy used by the mostly mute &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts.

==Cast==
* Don Messick as Pixie 
* Daws Butler as Dixie and Mr. Jinks

<text>In neurobiology, a tetanic stimulation consists of a high-frequency sequence of individual stimulations of a neuron. It is associated with potentiation.

High-frequency stimulation causes an increase in release called post-tetanic potentiation (Kandel 2003). This presynaptic event is caused by calcium influx. Calcium-protein interactions then produce a change in vesicle exocytosis. The result of these changes is to make the postsynaptic cell more likely to fire an action potential. 

Tetanic stimulation is used in medicine to detect a non-depolarizing block or a depolarizing block on the neuromuscular junction. Lower elicitations of tetanic stimulation in aged muscles were shown to be caused by lower levels of anaerobic energy provision in skeletal muscles.

<text>Harold Neufeld (born October 10, 1927) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1993, and a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1992.

== Career ==
Neufeld began a public practice as a Chartered Accountant in 1954, and was a member of the Chartered Accountants of Manitoba.

He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election as a Progressive Conservative, losing to incumbent New Democrat Vic Schroeder by 527 votes in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Rossmere. In the 1988 election, with NDP support falling throughout the province, he was able to defeat Schroeder by 526 votes in a rematch.

Neufeld was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for the Manitoba Hydro Act and Seniors on May 9, 1988. He was relieved of the latter responsibility on April 21, 1989. He was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1990 provincial election.

Neufeld stepped down from his cabinet position on January 14, 1992, and resigned from the legislature on May 12, 1993. There are suggestions that Neufeld resigned as a matter of principle, disturbed by the dubious methods used by the Filmon government to conceal its deficit spending.

A lifelong Mennonite, Neufeld joined the executive of Menno Simons College and became chair of the Menno Simons College Foundation after his retirement from the legislature.

<doc id="1156776" wikidata="Q1291626" url="?curid=1156776" title="Implicant">
<text>In Boolean logic, the term implicant has either a generic or a particular meaning. In the generic use, it refers to the hypothesis of an implication (). In the particular use, a product term (i.e., a conjunction of literals) &quot;P&quot; is an implicant of a Boolean function &quot;F&quot;, denoted formula_1, if &quot;P&quot; implies &quot;F&quot; (i.e., whenever &quot;P&quot; takes the value 1 so does &quot;F&quot;).
For instance, implicants of the function
:formula_2
include the terms formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, 
as well as some others.

== Prime implicant ==
A prime implicant of a function is an implicant (in the above particular sense) that cannot be covered by a more general, (more reduced, meaning with fewer literals) implicant. W. V. Quine defined a &quot;prime implicant&quot; to be an implicant that is minimal—that is, the removal of any literal from &quot;P&quot; results in a non-implicant for &quot;F&quot;. Essential prime implicants (also known as core prime implicants) are prime implicants that cover an output of the function that no combination of other prime implicants is able to cover.

Using the example above, one can easily see that while formula_3 (and others) is a prime implicant, formula_4 and formula_5 are not. From the latter, multiple literals can be removed to make it prime:

*formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12 can be removed, yielding formula_6.
*Alternatively, formula_12 and formula_6 can be removed, yielding formula_3.
*Finally, formula_10 and formula_6 can be removed, yielding formula_19.

The process of removing literals from a Boolean term is called expanding the term. Expanding by one literal doubles the number of input combinations for which the term is true (in binary Boolean algebra). Using the example function above, we may expand formula_4 to formula_3 or to formula_19 without changing the cover of formula_23.

The sum of all prime implicants of a Boolean function is called its complete sum, minimal covering sum, or Blake canonical form.

<doc id="1156778" wikidata="Q1535657" url="?curid=1156778" title="Ball-peen hammer">
<text>A ball-peen or machinist&#x27;s hammer, is a type of peening hammer used in metalworking. It has two heads, one flat and the other, called the peen, rounded. It is distinguished from a cross-peen hammer, diagonal-peen hammer, point-peen hammer, or chisel-peen hammer by having a hemispherical peen.

== Etymology ==

In the word &quot;ball-peen&quot;, &quot;peen&quot;, probably comes from a North Germanic source; compare dialectal Norwegian &quot;penn&quot; (“peen”), Danish &quot;pind&quot; (“peg”), German &quot;Pinne&quot; (“the peen of a hammer”), Old Swedish &quot;pæna&quot; (“to pound iron with a hammer”).

== Uses ==
Besides peening (surface-hardening by impact), the ball-peen hammer is useful for many tasks, such as striking punches and chisels (usually performed with the flat face of the hammer). The peening face or ball face is useful for rounding off edges of metal pins and fasteners, such as rivets. It can also be used to make gaskets for mating surfaces: a suitable gasket material is held over the surface that needs a gasket, and the operator lightly taps around the edges of the mating surface to perforate the gasket material.

== Variants ==
Variants include the straight-peen, diagonal-peen, and cross-peen hammer. Instead of a ball-shaped head, these hammers have a wedge-shaped head. The straight-peen hammer has a wedge oriented parallel to the hammer&#x27;s handle. The cross-peen hammer&#x27;s wedge is oriented perpendicular to the handle. The head of a diagonal-peen hammer, as the name implies, has a wedge set at a 45° angle from the handle; it can be a left angle or a right angle, and some peen hammers have a double diagonal wedge for ergonomic reasons. They are commonly used by blacksmiths during the forging process to deliver blows for forging or to strike other forging tools.

== Head materials ==
Ball-peen hammer heads are typically made of heat treated forged high-carbon steel or alloy steel; it is harder than the face of a claw hammer. Softer brass heads are sometimes used.

<text>The Nakajima J5N was an abandoned Japanese prototype fighter aircraft of the World War II era.
J5N was developed as twin-engine interceptor for countering attacks by Boeing B-29 Superfortress.

==Design and development==
During the spring of 1943, the JNAF issued an 18-Shi specification for a single-seat twin-engine interceptor capable of reaching a top speed of 666 km/h (414 mph) at 6,000 m (19,690 ft). Nakajima submitted a proposal based on the earlier J1N1 &quot;Gekko&quot; three-seat night fighter, although this new aircraft – designated J5N1 – was slightly smaller. The layout of the J5N was similar to the J1N: a low set wing on which were mounted the two powerplants, 1,484 kW (1,990 hp) Nakajima Homare 21 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engines, with a long fuselage ending in a conventional tail arrangement. For maximum utilization of the power from the twin engines, large four-blade propellers were fitted which also featured large spinners (as fitted to the J1N). The main wheels retracted rearwards into the engine nacelles, and the tailwheel was fixed. The cockpit was set above the wing, and featured a starboard-opening canopy. The nose was streamlined to offer the pilot an excellent forward view during landing, takeoff and taxiing.

Armament of the J5N consisted of two 30 mm and two 20 mm cannon, and provision was made for a centreline 250 kg (550 lb) bomb. The J5N was designed to combat the large, heavily armed and fast B-29 Superfortress, and so required such heavy armament in order to do severe damage in the brief windows of time allowed for firing passes. To concentrate the firepower, the four cannons were mounted in the nose of the J5N; if a single-engine fighter were unfortunate enough to find itself in front of a J5N, a single hit from a 30mm shell would have been more than adequate to destroy it.

==Operational history==
Impressed with the design, the JNAF authorized the development of the J5N1, assigned the name , and six prototypes were requested to be built. Progress was impeded by the failure of the engines to produce their promised power, and by a steady increase in the weight of the airframe as the need to reverse the long-standing policy of giving low priority to armor protection led to a buildup of weight and a drop in performance. The first prototype – lacking its armament – made its first flight July 13, 1944, and was something of a disappointment. The top speed attained was only 597 km/h (371 mph) – far below the specified 666 km/h (414 mph) of the requirement. Despite the other five prototypes also having flown with numerous enhancements, the aircraft never achieved its design speed, and the project was abandoned soon after in February 1945. Four of the six experimental aircraft were lost to accidents.

==Variants==
* J5N1 : Single-seat interceptor fighter aircraft. Six built.

<doc id="1156783" wikidata="Q7803359" url="?curid=1156783" title="Tim Costello">
<text>Timothy Ewen Costello (born 4 March 1955) is an Australian Baptist minister who was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Advocate of World Vision Australia. Costello worked as a lawyer and served as mayor of St Kilda. He has authored a number of books on faith and life. A National Trust poll in 2014 elected him one of Australia&#x27;s 100 national living treasures.

==Early life==
Costello was born in Melbourne, Victoria, where he grew up in the suburb of Blackburn and was educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School (graduating in 1972). He is a descendant of Irish immigrant Patrick Costello, who was expelled from the Parliament of Victoria in the 1860s for electoral fraud.

Costello studied at Monash University, graduating with a Bachelor of Jurisprudence degree in 1976, a Bachelor of Laws in 1978 and a Diploma of Education in 1979.

Costello is the brother of Peter Costello, the former treasurer of Australia and Federal Member for Higgins.

==Career==

===Legal===
Costello practised as a solicitor in family and criminal law, both in established firms and in his own practice.

===Ministry===
In 1981, Costello travelled to Switzerland with his wife, Merridie, where they both studied theology at the International Baptist Seminary Rüschlikon near Zürich, before graduating with a Bachelor of Divinity and returning to Australia to become the minister of St Kilda Baptist Church. He also received a Master of Theology from Whitley College, a theological college of the Melbourne College of Divinity.

Ordained as a Baptist minister in 1987, Costello, along with his wife Merridie and a team of others, rebuilt the congregation at the St Kilda Baptist Church and opened a drop-in centre. As part of the church&#x27;s outreach program, he started a legal office at the church where he practised as a part-time solicitor. He also taught urban ministry at Whitley College, a college of the University of Melbourne.

From 1995 to 2003, Costello was a minister of the Collins Street Baptist Church and the executive director of Urban Seed, a Christian not-for-profit organisation created in response to concern about homelessness, drug abuse and the marginalisation of the city&#x27;s street people.

Costello served as the president of the Baptist Union of Australia from 1999 to 2002. He has also been patron of Baptist World Aid Australia, a member of the Australian Earth Charter Committee, a council member of the Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture, a spokesperson for the Interchurch Gambling Taskforce, a member of the National Advisory Body on Gambling and a member of the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation.

===Political career===
Costello was elected Mayor of St Kilda Council in 1993 and became well known for championing the cause of local democracy and for his clashes with the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. Kennett attacked Costello as being un-Victorian for speaking out against the gaming-led recovery of the state and often referred to him as &quot;that leftist cleric&quot;. Costello&#x27;s political career ended when his mayoral position was abolished with the whole St Kilda Council in Kennett&#x27;s reform and consolidation of local government in 1994. Towards the end of that time, he was approached by the Australian Democrats political party to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate, but decided against it, partly due to the likelihood that this could place him in direct conflict with his brother if Peter became Treasurer.

Costello was an elected delegate at the Australian Constitutional Convention in Canberra in February 1998. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, he was frequently seen in the Australian national media commenting on gambling and other social problems. He also has spoken out in favour of stronger gun control in Australia, acting at times as the co-chairman or spokesman of the National Coalition for Gun Control.

=== World Vision Australia ===

Costello was appointed as CEO of World Vision Australia on 24 November 2003. Having spent much of his career focussing on local and domestic issues, Costello said he relished the opportunity to focus on international issues. In his first full year in the role, Costello became the face of Australia&#x27;s response to the Boxing Day Tsunami. Costello led fundraising efforts, and World Vision Australia raised over $118 million for relief and rehabilitation programs. During Costello&#x27;s tenure, the organisation grew from funding 480 projects benefiting 10.4 million people, to more than 800 World Vision development projects benefiting close to 100 million people across the globe including in Australia.

After 13 years as CEO, Costello announced that he was stepping aside to become the Chief Advocate for World Vision Australia on 9 May 2016. He remained as Chief Advocate for a further two years before resigning on 7 June 2019, citing the physical and emotional toll of the role over many years.

=== Other roles ===
Costello has since become the Director of Ethical Voice, Executive Director of Micah Australia and a Senior Fellow at Centre for Public Christianity. He is also Chair of the Community Council of Australia and an Advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform.

==Awards and honours==
Costello received the Victorian of the Year award in July 2004 in recognition of his public and community service. He was made an officer of the Order of Australia in June 2005 and was the Victorian nominee for the Australian of the Year award in 2006. He is the 2008 winner of the Australian Peace Prize awarded by the Peace Organisation of Australia. He is also listed by the National Trust as a &quot;National Living Treasure&quot;.

In 2008, Costello received an honorary doctorate from the Australian Catholic University in recognition of &quot;his contributions to religious life and social justice&quot;.

<doc id="1156793" wikidata="Q1412117" url="?curid=1156793" title="Lik Sang">
<text>Lik Sang () was a popular distributor of Asian electronics. The company sold import games, toys, figures, anime-related items, and obscure adapters and controllers for various video game platforms. Lik Sang closed as of October 24, 2006, as a result of multiple lawsuits filed against them by Sony.

== History ==

===Launch===
Lik-Sang was established in 1998 in Hong Kong. It became well known for its sales of modchips for video game consoles that enabled the normally locked-down consoles to play import and homebrew games, but it also allowed the use of pirated video games. The modchips were not all physical chips; they included devices such as flash cartridges that allow Game Boy users to upload ROMs and homebrew applications onto the device, and play them as if it were a regular gaming cartridge.

===Legal issues===
In 2002, the company was sued by major video game console producers, such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo and Microsoft Corporation, alleging contributory copyright infringement as the modchips (and other related devices) enabled playing of unauthorized video game titles on those consoles. The High Court of Hong Kong granted injunctions preventing Lik-Sang from selling these devices. After these suits, Lik-Sang began expanding its area of expertise by reinventing itself (under a new owner) as a vendor of legitimate, but obscure, accessories, such as consumer electronics, games, merchandise, and t-shirts.

===Partnering with independent developers===
Lik-Sang was a strong supporter of the Dreamcast Community, in 2003 they partnered with Dreamcast-Scene (DCS) and GOAT Store to promote independently developed games, they had an exclusive deal with GOAT Store that made them the sole distributor of all independently released games until their demise in 2006.

With GOAT Store Publishing they distributed 4 games offering free shipping all over the world.

===Closure===
In August 2005, the company was once again in legal trouble, this time from Sony. Lik-Sang had imported PlayStation Portable devices from areas where they were available, and re-exported them to UK customers before the UK release date, which Sony alleged was a violation of trademark rights. Lik-Sang continued shipping PSPs, claiming Hong Kong&#x27;s trademark law follows the principle of international exhaustion of trademark rights and therefore allows an item to be traded freely once it appears in a market anywhere in the world.

On October 18, 2006, the High Court in London (Patents Court) ruled the shipments were indeed in breach of Sony&#x27;s rights. The following day, Lik-Sang posted a message on their website claiming they had been forced out of business due to Sony&#x27;s legal action. Sony responded in a statement saying that Lik-Sang had not contested the case, thus incurring no legal fees, and had not paid any damages or costs to Sony. However, Lik-Sang replied once more that their legal representatives spent over a year to contest the UK&#x27;s court jurisdiction and tried to defend against Sony&#x27;s allegations of parallel importation and copyright infringement, and that Sony launched duplicate actions in different countries. According to Lik-Sang&#x27;s final statements, two different judges expressed their surprise about the high legal expenses claimed by Sony.

Since October 24, 2006, Lik-Sang&#x27;s website has been offline. The Lik-Sang forums have also been closed down. Between 2006 and 2014, the domain carried only a letter to former customers in regards to the ruling, and the circumstances surrounding it. Since 2014, the domain simply redirects to this Wikipedia article.

==Court decisions against Lik Sang==
The following decisions against Lik Sang can be read on-line:
* SCEI v Lik Sang International Ltd (High Court of Hong Kong, 2003)
* Nintendo v Lik Sang International Ltd (High Court of Hong Kong, 2003)
* SCEI v Pacific Game Technology (UK Patents Court, 2006)

==Legacy==
Lik-Sang is widely known in console gaming circles. Some even form a verb with the name, as in &quot;I could Lik-Sang the controller if I had the money&quot;, and cult game site Penny Arcade often spoke about Lik-Sang and featured them in their webcomics.

Famed iPhone and PlayStation jailbreaker Geohot makes mention of Lik Sang in his rap response to Sony&#x27;s lawsuit against him, where he raps &quot;I shed a tear every time I think of Lik Sang&quot;.

<doc id="1156801" wikidata="Q2733812" url="?curid=1156801" title="Delroy Wilson">
<text>Delroy George Wilson [[Order of Distinction|CD]] (5 October 1948 – 6 March 1995) was a Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae singer. Wilson is often regarded as Jamaica&#x27;s first child star, having first found success as a teenager. His youngest son, Karl &quot;Konan&quot; Wilson, has found success as part of British duo Krept and Konan.

==Biography==
Delroy Wilson began his recording career at the age of thirteen, while still a pupil at Boys Town Primary School. Wilson released his first single &quot;Emy Lou&quot; in 1962 for record producer, Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd. His early years with Coxsone yielded a number of ska hits, the biggest of which, the Lee Perry-written &quot;Joe Liges&quot; was an attack on rival producer and former Dodd employee Prince Buster. This was followed by another Perry-written attack on Buster, &quot;Spit in the Sky&quot;. Further singles followed, including &quot;One Two Three&quot;, &quot;I Shall Not Remove&quot;, &quot;Look Who Is Back Again&quot; (a duet with Slim Smith), and another anti-Buster song, &quot;Prince Pharaoh&quot;, notably the only record featuring the voice of Dodd himself. He is regarded as Jamaica&#x27;s first child star.

His voice matured as he left his teens, around the time of ska&#x27;s transition to rocksteady and this period in the late 1960s produced many hits including one of the first rocksteady records, &quot;Dancing Mood&quot;, &quot;Jerk in Time&quot; (with the Wailers), &quot;Feel Good All Over&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not a King&quot;, &quot;True Believer in Love&quot;, &quot;Rain From the Skies&quot;, &quot;Conquer Me&quot; and &quot;Riding for a Fall&quot;. &quot;Won&#x27;t You Come Home&quot;, a duet with Ken Boothe on a rhythm originally cut by The Conquerors for Sonia Pottinger has become one of the most-versioned Jamaican tracks ever. After leaving Studio One he recorded for other labels, with varying degrees of success, and set up his own short-lived &quot;W&amp;C&quot; label. He enjoyed success with Bunny Lee in the late 1960s and early 1970s with tracks such as &quot;This Old Heart of Mine&quot;, &quot;Footsteps of Another Man&quot;, and &quot;Better Must Come&quot;. His double A-side &quot;It Hurts&quot;/&quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; was a skinhead favourite and narrowly missed UK chart success. He recorded a version of &quot;Run Run&quot;, a song he had originally recorded for Dodd, for maverick producer Keith Hudson.

Wilson toured the UK and recorded for Trojan Records in 1970.

In 1972, Michael Manley&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Party chose Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Better Must Come&quot; as their election campaign song. The same year saw the release of one of his most popular songs, &quot;Cool Operator&quot;, which became his nickname. He worked with a string of producers in the years that followed, including Joe Gibbs (&quot;Mash Up Illiteracy&quot;, &quot;Pretty Girl&quot;), Gussie Clarke (&quot;Love&quot;), Winston &quot;Niney&quot; Holness (&quot;Rascal Man&quot;), Harry J (&quot;Ask The Lonely&quot;), and Joseph Hoo Kim (&quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot;).

In 1976, he recorded a cover of The Wailers&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Still Waiting&quot; for Lloyd Charmers, which was hugely popular, and enjoyed some cross-over success, and was followed by the album &quot;Sarge&quot;, which is considered one of his strongest. Also a Bob Andy produced song, &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot; rose to number one in Jamaica. Wilson continued to be successful until the end of the decade, but his career floundered during the early 1980s, with releases less common. His fortunes revived in the digital age with releases for King Jammy (&quot;Don&#x27;t Put The Blame on Me&quot;) and Bunny Lee (&quot;Ease Up&quot;), with new albums following, but he again drifted out of the limelight, with his health declining, and is best remembered for his earlier work.

Wilson is lionised by The Clash in their 1978 track punk rock garage band reggae fusion, &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot; with the lines &quot;Delroy Wilson, you&#x27;re a cool operator&quot;. 

Delroy Wilson died at the age of 46 on 6 March 1995 at Kingston&#x27;s UWI hospital, of complications from cirrhosis of the liver.

In 2013 Wilson was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican Government.

In 2015 Wilson&#x27;s childhood friend Everard &quot;Jah Ruby&quot; Metcalf released the album &quot;The Delroy Wilson Story&quot;, featuring 21 cover versions of Wilson&#x27;s songs.

<text>Sometimes Aunt Martha Does Dreadful Things is a 1971 cult film written, produced, and directed by Thomas Casey.

Set in Miami, and shot at the now closed Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, the story centers around two criminals on the run: Stanley (Wayne Crawford under the name Scott Lawrence) and Paul, played by Abe Zwick, who, because of their criminal history in Baltimore, have decided to lie low in a Miami suburb to avoid prosecution. They hatch a plan that involves Paul dressing in drag to pose as Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Aunt Martha.&quot;

Stanley is shown intimately in the company of several young women. Paul is concerned that Stanley&#x27;s social lifestyle will lead to them getting noticed, and subsequently busted. Stanley seems to have no real direction in his life beyond women, and drugs. He becomes nasty and violent when he hangs out with Jerry (played by Jessie Eastland), and Jerry&#x27;s drugged out girlfriends. Aunt Martha has a bad habit of killing all of Stanley&#x27;s girlfriends to keep them quiet.

<doc id="1156806" wikidata="Q292430" url="?curid=1156806" title="AGM-131 SRAM II">
<text>The AGM-131 SRAM II (&quot;Short-Range Attack Missile&quot;) was a nuclear air-to-surface missile intended as a replacement for the AGM-69 SRAM. The solid-fueled missile was to be dropped from a B-1B Lancer, carry the W89 warhead and have a range of 400 km. However, the program was canceled by President George H. W. Bush for geopolitical reasons just as the first flight-test missile was delivered.

== Development ==
The mission of the SRAM family is to deliver the warhead to the target without the need for the penetrating bomber to directly overfly the target. The SRAM family of weapons had an extremely small radar signature and were near-impossible to counter. SRAM ensured the airborne leg of the US nuclear triad (the others being land-based ICBMs and SLBM) and was the penetrating air launched strategic nuclear weapon for the B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit.

In 1977, the USAF planned to develop an upgrade of the SRAM for the forthcoming B-1A bomber as AGM-69B SRAM B. When the B-1A was cancelled in 1978, the AGM-69B was dropped, too. After the resurrection of the B-1 program (as B-1B) in 1981, it was decided to develop an entirely new weapon, the SRAM II.

In 1986, Boeing was finally awarded a development contract for the AGM-131A SRAM II. The AGM-131A was planned to have only about 2/3 the size of an AGM-69A, so that 36 missiles could be carried by the B-1B, as compared to 24 AGM-69As. The final design of the SRAM II ended up with the &quot;II&quot; version roughly equal to the &quot;A&quot; version in size and about 80% of the weight. One new feature of SRAM II was a lighter, simpler, and more reliable two-pulse solid rocket motor designed by Hercules for increased range and age stability.

The SRAM II was slated to use the newly developed W89 thermonuclear warhead, which being much newer, was also much safer to operate than the W-69 of the AGM-69. The W89 had a 200 kiloton design yield.

Initial Operational Capability for the AGM-131A was planned for 1993, but before flight tests could take place, the program was cancelled in 1991.

==SRAM-T==
The SRAM II air vehicle was also the basis for a tactical nuclear variant - the SRAM T which employed a different warhead, the W91 thermonuclear warhead, with a selectable yield from 10 to 100 kilotons. It had a longer range than the baseline SRAM II, around 250 miles (approximately 400 kilometers). As a NATO theater nuclear weapon, SRAM-T was to be carried by the F-15E and F-111, but it was also compatible with the F-16 and the Tornado. Deployment was planned for 1995.

==Cancellation==
Both SRAM II and SRAM T were canceled in September 1991 by President George H.W. Bush, along with the W89 and W91 warheads.

<text>The Bridge of the Gods is a steel truss cantilever bridge that spans the Columbia River between Cascade Locks, Oregon, and Washington state near North Bonneville. It is approximately east of Portland, Oregon, and 4 miles (6.4 km) upriver from Bonneville Dam. It is a toll bridge operated by the Port of Cascade Locks.
The bridge was completed by the Wauna Toll Bridge Company and opened in 1926 at a length of . The higher river levels resulting from the construction of the Bonneville Dam required the bridge to be further elevated by in 1938 and extended to its current length of . The Columbia River Bridge Company of Spokane, Washington, acquired ownership of the bridge in 1953 for $735,000 (equivalent to $ today). The Port of Cascade Locks purchased the bridge with $950,000 (or $ today) in revenue bonds, issued on November 1, 1961. The Port of Cascade Locks Commission owns and operates the bridge still today.

The bridge is named after the historic geologic feature also known as Bridge of the Gods.

The Pacific Crest Trail crosses the Columbia River on the Bridge of the Gods. The lowest elevation of the trail is about a mile north from the bridge at . 

Onlookers in September 1927 saw Charles Lindbergh fly the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; from Portland low over the new bridge and then, in a bit of barnstorming, make a 180 degree turn and fly back under the bridge, continuing to the Portland Airport, then on Swan Island.

For many years, the bridge toll was $1 per crossing; In 2016, it was raised to $2 due to the increased traffic after the release of the 2014 film &quot;Wild&quot;. The toll was increased to $3 in July 2022.

<doc id="1156815" wikidata="Q7102016" url="?curid=1156815" title="Organizational ecology">
<text>Organizational ecology (also organizational demography and the population ecology of organizations) is a theoretical and empirical approach in the social sciences that is considered a sub-field of organizational studies. Organizational ecology utilizes insights from biology, economics, and sociology, and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die.

The ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levels).

What is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.

== Development ==

Wharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the &quot;organization-set&quot;, and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966. However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also adaptive management and adaptive performance). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.

In 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as &quot;the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field&quot;. He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also Open and closed systems in social science).

The first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by Michael T. Hannan and the late John H. Freeman in their 1977 &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; piece &quot;The population ecology of organizations&quot; and later refined in their 1989 book &quot;Organizational Ecology&quot;, examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like natural selection occurs. This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change.

Organizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in organizational studies, and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books &quot;The Demography of Corporations and Industries&quot; by Glenn Carroll and Michael T. Hannan (2000) and &quot;Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies&quot; by Michael T. Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.

== Key concerns ==
Organizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect:
* rates of creation of new organizational forms
* rates of demise of organizations and organizational forms
* the rates of change in organizational forms.

=== Organizational mortality ===
Organizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called &quot;Organizational Mortality&quot;.

==== Inertia and change ====
This factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality.

Theories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Both internal and external resistance to change can result in organizational inertia, providing some resistance to organizational adaptation. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.

Hannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy (See also Bounded rationality).

==== Niche theory ====

Niche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security.

Niche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that &quot;generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments&quot;. The exception is produced by environments which &quot;place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization&quot;.

Thus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.

==== Density dependence ====

Organizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and competition. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.

The founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.

==== Age dependence ====

How an organization&#x27;s risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns:

* Liability of newness. Here, the risk of failure is high initially but declines as the organization ages.
* Liability of adolescence. The risk of mortality will be low at first as the organization is buffered from failure due to support by external constituents and initial endowments. But when these initial resources become depleted, the mortality hazard shoots up and then declines following the liability of newness pattern.
* Liabilities of aging. Here, the risk of failure increases with organizational age. This could be due to a &quot;liability of senescence&quot; (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a &quot;liability of obsolescence&quot; (a growing external mismatch with the environment).

== Evolutionary approaches to organizations ==
Organizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982). Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959). Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology&#x27;s perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989, pp 20–22), while Nelson &amp; Winter (1982, p. 11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective. Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- &#x27;organizational forms&#x27;, as in organizational ecology, or &#x27;routines&#x27; as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands.

<doc id="1156819" wikidata="Q1049866" url="?curid=1156819" title="Population ecology">
<text>Population ecology is a sub-field of ecology that deals with the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the environment, such as birth and death rates, and by immigration and emigration.

The discipline is important in conservation biology, especially in the development of population viability analysis which makes it possible to predict the long-term probability of a species persisting in a given patch of habitat. Although population ecology is a subfield of biology, it provides interesting problems for mathematicians and statisticians who work in population dynamics.

==History==
In the 1940s, ecology was divided into autecology—the study of individual species in relation to the environment—and synecology—the study of groups of species in relation to the environment. The term autecology (from Ancient Greek: αὐτο, &quot;aúto&quot;, &quot;self&quot;; οίκος, &quot;oíkos&quot;, &quot;household&quot;; and λόγος, &quot;lógos&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;), refers to roughly the same field of study as concepts such as life cycles and behaviour as adaptations to the environment by individual organisms. Eugene Odum, writing in 1953, considered that synecology should be divided into population ecology, community ecology and ecosystem ecology, renaming autecology as &#x27;species ecology&#x27; (Odum regarded &quot;autecology&quot; as an archaic term), thus that there were four subdivisions of ecology.

==Terminology==
A population is defined as a group of interacting organisms of the same species. A demographic structure of a population is how populations are often quantified. The total number of individuals in a population is defined as a population size, and how dense these individuals are is defined as population density. There is also a population&#x27;s geographic range, which has limits that a species can tolerate (such as temperature).

Population size can be influenced by the per capita population growth rate (rate at which the population size changes per individual in the population.) Births, deaths, emigration, and immigration rates all play a significant role in growth rate. The maximum per capita growth rate for a population is known as the intrinsic rate of increase.

In a population, carrying capacity is known as the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain, which is determined by resources available. In many classic population models, r is represented as the intrinsic growth rate, where K is the carrying capacity, and N0 is the initial population size.
==Population dynamics==

The development of population ecology owes much to the mathematical models known as population dynamics, which were originally formulae derived from demography at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century.

The beginning of population dynamics is widely regarded as the work of Malthus, formulated as the Malthusian growth model. According to Malthus, assuming that the conditions (the environment) remain constant (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;), a population will grow (or decline) exponentially. This principle provided the basis for the subsequent predictive theories, such as the demographic studies such as the work of Benjamin Gompertz and Pierre François Verhulst in the early 19th century, who refined and adjusted the Malthusian demographic model.

A more general model formulation was proposed by F. J. Richards in 1959, further expanded by Simon Hopkins, in which the models of Gompertz, Verhulst and also Ludwig von Bertalanffy are covered as special cases of the general formulation. The Lotka–Volterra predator-prey equations are another famous example, as well as the alternative Arditi–Ginzburg equations.

=== Exponential vs. logistic growth ===
When describing growth models, there are two main types of models that are most commonly used: exponential and logistic growth.

When the per capita rate of increase takes the same positive value regardless of population size, the graph shows exponential growth. Exponential growth takes on the assumption that there is unlimited resources and no predation. An example of exponential population growth is that of the Monk Parakeets in the United States. Originally from South America, Monk Parakeets were either released or escaped from people who owned them. These birds experienced exponential growth from the years 1975-1994 and grew about 55 times their population size from 1975. This growth is likely due to reproduction within their population, as opposed to the addition of more birds from South America (Van Bael &amp; Prudet-Jones 1996).

When the per capita rate of increase decreases as the population increases towards the maximum limit, or carrying capacity, the graph shows logistic growth. Environmental and social variables, along with many others, impact the carrying capacity of a population, meaning that it has the ability to change (Schacht 1980).

== Fisheries and wildlife management ==
In fisheries and wildlife management, population is affected by three dynamic rate functions.

*Natality or birth rate, often recruitment, which means reaching a certain size or reproductive stage. Usually refers to the age a fish can be caught and counted in nets.
*Population growth rate, which measures the growth of individuals in size and length. More important in fisheries, where population is often measured in biomass.
*Mortality, which includes harvest mortality and natural mortality. Natural mortality includes non-human predation, disease and old age.

If &quot;N&quot;1 is the number of individuals at time 1 then
formula_1
where &quot;N&quot;0 is the number of individuals at time 0, &quot;B&quot; is the number of individuals born, &quot;D&quot; the number that died, &quot;I&quot; the number that immigrated, and &quot;E&quot; the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1.

If we measure these rates over many time intervals, we can determine how a population&#x27;s density changes over time. Immigration and emigration are present, but are usually not measured.

All of these are measured to determine the harvestable surplus, which is the number of individuals that can be harvested from a population without affecting long-term population stability or average population size. The harvest within the harvestable surplus is termed &quot;compensatory&quot; mortality, where the harvest deaths are substituted for the deaths that would have occurred naturally. Harvest above that level is termed &quot;additive&quot; mortality, because it adds to the number of deaths that would have occurred naturally. These terms are not necessarily judged as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; respectively, in population management. For example, a fish &amp; game agency might aim to reduce the size of a deer population through additive mortality. Bucks might be targeted to increase buck competition, or does might be targeted to reduce reproduction and thus overall population size.

For the management of many fish and other wildlife populations, the goal is often to achieve the largest possible long-run sustainable harvest, also known as maximum sustainable yield (or MSY). Given a population dynamic model, such as any of the ones above, it is possible to calculate the population size that produces the largest harvestable surplus at equilibrium. While the use of population dynamic models along with statistics and optimization to set harvest limits for fish and game is controversial among some scientists, it has been shown to be more effective than the use of human judgment in computer experiments where both incorrect models and natural resource management students competed to maximize yield in two hypothetical fisheries. To give an example of a non-intuitive result, fisheries produce more fish when there is a nearby refuge from human predation in the form of a nature reserve, resulting in higher catches than if the whole area was open to fishing.

==r/K selection==

An important concept in population ecology is the r/K selection theory. For example, if an animal has the choice of producing one or a few offspring, or to put a lot of effort or little effort in offspring—these are all examples of trade-offs. In order for species to thrive, they must choose what is best for them, leading to a clear distinction between r and K selected species.

The first variable is &quot;r&quot; (the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size, density independent) and the second variable is &quot;K&quot; (the carrying capacity of a population, density dependent).
It is important to understand the difference between density-independent factors when selecting the intrinsic rate and density-dependent for the selection of the carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is only found during a density-dependent population. Density-dependent factors influence the carrying capacity are predation, harvest, and genetics, so when selecting the carrying capacity it is important to understand to look at the predation or harvest rates that influence the population (Stewart 2004).
An &quot;r&quot;-selected species (e.g., many kinds of insects, such as aphids) is one that has high rates of fecundity, low levels of parental investment in the young, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favors productivity in r-selected species.

In contrast, a &quot;K&quot;-selected species (such as humans) has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Evolution in &quot;K&quot;-selected species favors efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring. K-selected species generally experience stronger competition, where populations generally live near carrying capacity. These species have heavy investment in offspring, resulting in longer lived organisms, and longer period of maturation. Offspring of K-selected species generally have a higher probability of survival, due to heavy parental care and nurturing.

== Offspring Quality ==
The offspring fitness is mainly affected by the size and quality of that specific offspring [depending on the species]. Factors that contribute to the relative fitness of offspring size is either the resources the parents provide to their young or morphological traits that come from the parents. The overall success of the offspring after the initial birth or hatching is the survival of the young, the growth rate, and the birthing success of the offspring. There is found to be no effect of the young being raised by the natural parents or foster parents, the offspring need the proper resources to survive (Kristi 2010). 

A study that was conducted on the egg size and offspring quality in birds found that, in summary, that the egg size contributes to the overall fitness of the offspring. This study shows the direct relationship to the survivorship curve Type I in that if the offspring is cared for during its early stages of life by a parent, it will die off later in life. However, if the offspring is not cared for by the parents due to an increase in egg quantity, then the survivorship curve will be similar to Type III, in that the offspring will die off early and will survive later in life.

== Top-down and bottom-up controls ==
=== Top-down controls ===
In some populations, organisms in lower trophic levels are controlled by organisms at the top. This is known as top-down control.

For example, the presence of top carnivores keep herbivore populations in check. If there were no top carnivores in the ecosystem, then herbivore populations would rapidly increase, leading to all plants being eaten. This ecosystem would eventually collapse.

=== Bottom-up controls ===
Bottom-up controls, on the other hand, are driven by producers in the ecosystem. If plant populations change, then the population of all species would be impacted.

For example, if plant populations decreased significantly, the herbivore populations would decrease, which would lead to a carnivore population decreasing too. Therefore, if all of the plants disappeared, then the ecosystem would collapse. Another example would be if there were too many plants available, then two herbivore populations may compete for the same food. The competition would lead to an eventual removal of one population.

=== Do all ecosystems have to be either top-down or bottom-up? ===
An ecosystem does not have to be either top-down or bottom-up. There are occasions where an ecosystem could be bottom-up sometimes, such as a marine ecosystem, but then have periods of top-down control due to fishing.

== Survivorship curves ==

Survivorship curves are graphs that show the distribution of survivors in a population according to age. Survivorship curves play an important role in comparing generations, populations, or even different species.

A Type I survivorship curve is characterized by the fact that death occurs in the later years of an organism&#x27;s life (mostly mammals). In other words, most organisms reach the maximum expected lifespan and the life expectancy and the age of death go hand-in-hand (Demetrius 1978). Typically, Type I survivorship curves characterize K-selected species.

Type II survivorship shows that death at any age is equally probable. This means that the chances of death are not dependent on or affected by the age of that organism. 

Type III curves indicate few surviving the younger years, but after a certain age, individuals are much more likely to survive. Type III survivorship typically characterizes r-selected species.

==Metapopulation==
Populations are also studied and conceptualized through the &quot;metapopulation&quot; concept. The metapopulation concept was introduced in 1969: &quot;as a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize.&quot; Metapopulation ecology is a simplified model of the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality. Patches are either occupied or they are not. Migrants moving among the patches are structured into metapopulations either as sources or sinks. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of migrants to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants. In metapopulation terminology there are emigrants (individuals that leave a patch) and immigrants (individuals that move into a patch). Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer questions about spatial and demographic ecology. An important concept in metapopulation ecology is the rescue effect, where small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. Metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks, such as dry years, and become sources when conditions are more favorable. Ecologists utilize a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.
Metapopulation ecology allows for ecologists to take in a wide range of factors when examining a metapopulation like genetics, the bottle-neck effect, and many more. Metapopulation data is extremely useful in understanding population dynamics as most species are not numerous and require specific resources from their habitats. In addition, metapopulation ecology allows for a deeper understanding of the effects of habitat loss, and can help to predict the future of a habitat. To elaborate, metapopulation ecology assumes that, before a habitat becomes uninhabitable, the species in it will emigrate out, or die off. This information is helpful to ecologists in determining what, if anything, can be done to aid a declining habitat. Overall, the information that metapopulation ecology provides is useful to ecologists in many ways (Hanski 1998).

==Journals==
The first journal publication of the Society of Population Ecology, titled &quot;Population Ecology&quot; (originally called &quot;Researches on Population Ecology&quot;) was released in 1952.

Scientific articles on population ecology can also be found in the &quot;Journal of Animal Ecology&quot;, &quot;Oikos&quot; and other journals.

<doc id="1156823" wikidata="Q2029930" url="?curid=1156823" title="Organization studies">
<text>Organization studies (also called organization science or organizational studies) is the academic field interested in a &quot;collective activity, and how it relates to organization, organizing, and management&quot;. It is &quot;the examination of how individuals construct organizational structures, processes, and practices and how these, in turn, shape social relations and create institutions that ultimately influence people&quot;.

Organizational studies comprise different areas that deal with the different aspects of the organizations, many of the approaches are functionalist but critical research also provide an alternative frame for understanding in the field. Fundamental to the study of management is organizational change. 

Historically, facilitating organizational change has proven to be a difficult subject, which is why different theoretical frameworks have evolved in an attempt to strategically streamline this process, such as utilizing external actors, or interim organizations, where it is important to define the expectations of the outcome of change before initiating it, so as to provide measurability.

==History==
It has followed numerous &#x27;turns&#x27; since its emergence in the 1960s: linguistic turn, spatial turn, practice turn, process turn, materiality turn, communication turn... A turn is a collective direction of research, focused on some coherent sets of concepts, theories, and ideas, which represent a point of bifurcation for the field itself. Most turns in organization studies relate to broader ones in social sciences and humanities. Researchers studying organizations and/or organizing processes have a recurring concern that those who work in organizations do not find organizational research particularly relevant. There is therefore a growing interest in the impact of organization studies. 
Public administrations also, around the world, are adopting massively new organizational models to increase their efficiency and improve public services. The Organization Studies field is becoming more popular also because the borders between a well-defined organization and customers, citizens, businesses, and professionals are more and more undefined. For example, social organization has been the subject of study in Spatio-temporal cohesiveness in human network theory.

With the recent historical turn, there is growing interest in historical organization studies, promising a closer union between organizational and historical research whose validity derives from historical veracity and conceptual rigor, enhancing understanding of historical, contemporary and future-directed social realities. Organizational studies as a discipline is also closely related to metathinking.

==Journals==
Major academic journals of the field are, among others: &quot;Organization Science&quot;, &quot;Organization Studies&quot;, &quot;Organization Theory&quot; and &quot;Organization&quot;.

==Conferences==
Researchers interested in organizations and organizing meet in the context of numerous conferences and workshops: the Academy of Management Annual Conference (in particular the OMT division), the European Group for Organizational Studies (EGOS), the Asia Pacific conference on Research in Organization Studies (APROS), the American and European Conference on Organization Studies (LAEMOS), the Organization Studies Summer Workshop, the International Symposium on Process Organization Studies (PROS), the Standing Conference on Organizational Symbolism (SCOS), the International Research Network (puntOorg), the Organizations, Artifacts &amp; Practices (OAP) workshop, Organization Science Winter Conference, etc.

<doc id="1156863" wikidata="Q7735234" url="?curid=1156863" title="The Freeman">
<text>The Freeman (formerly published as The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty or Ideas on Liberty) was an American libertarian magazine, formerly published by the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). It was founded in 1950 by John Chamberlain, Henry Hazlitt, and Suzanne La Follette. The magazine was purchased by a FEE-owned company in 1954, and FEE took over direct control of the magazine in 1956.

In September 2016, FEE announced it would permanently end publication of &quot;The Freeman&quot;.

==Background==
A number of earlier publications had used the &quot;Freeman&quot; name, some of which were intellectual predecessors to the magazine founded in 1950.

===&quot;The Freeman&quot; (1920–1924)===
From 1920 to 1924, Albert Jay Nock, a libertarian author and social critic, edited a weekly magazine called &quot;The Freeman&quot;. Nock&#x27;s magazine was funded by co-editor Francis Neilson, a British author and former member of Parliament, and his wife Helen Swift Neilson, who was heir to a meatpacking fortune. The Neilsons had previously provided funding to &quot;The Nation&quot; when Nock was a writer there. Nock got fellow &quot;Nation&quot; writer Suzanne La Follette to join his new venture as an assistant editor, with Walter Fuller (the husband of Crystal Eastman) as managing editor. Other contributors included Conrad Aiken, Charles A. Beard, William Henry Chamberlin, John Dos Passos, Thomas Mann, Lewis Mumford, Bertrand Russell, Carl Sandburg, Lincoln Steffens, Louis Untermeyer, and Thorstein Veblen. La Follette revived the periodical as &quot;The New Freeman&quot; in March 1930, but the revival was discontinued a year later.

===&quot;The Freeman&quot; (1937–1942)===
In 1937, Frank Chodorov began another magazine called &quot;The Freeman&quot;, this time a monthly magazine promoting the philosophy of Henry George and published by the Henry George School of Social Science. It was explicitly not a revival of Nock&#x27;s magazine, but Nock was an occasional contributor. In 1942, Chodorov was dismissed by the Henry George School over political differences, primarily that Chodorov remained openly critical of the political act of war, and in 1943 the magazine was renamed the &quot;Henry George News&quot;.

In 1939, Leonard Read, then a manager for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, created a small publishing house called Pamphleteers, Inc., for the purpose of publishing pro-liberty works, starting with &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; by Rose Wilder Lane. Pamphleteers used &quot;The Freeman&quot; as the overall name of their book series.

==Early years==
The new magazine to be called &quot;The Freeman&quot; was founded in 1950 through the efforts of John Chamberlain, Henry Hazlitt, and Isaac Don Levine. Chamberlain and Hazlitt wrote for the anti-communist magazine &quot;Plain Talk&quot;, where Levine was editor. All three were dissatisfied with the negative approach of opposing communism and wanted a project that would spread a more positive message. They pulled together $200,000 in funding with help from textile importer Alfred Kohlberg (one of the funders of &quot;Plain Talk&quot;), DuPont executive Jasper Crane, Sun Oil president J. Howard Pew, and former United States President Herbert Hoover. Levine dropped out before publication began, so Chamberlain and Hazlitt brought in La Follette, who had worked on Nock&#x27;s &quot;Freeman&quot; and also at &quot;Plain Talk&quot;. The board of the new publication included advertising executive Lawrence Fertig, legal scholar Roscoe Pound, and economists Ludwig von Mises and Leo Wolman. Also on the board was Read, who in 1946 had founded the Foundation for Economic Education.

The magazine launched in October 1950 with 6,000 subscribers, mostly brought over from &quot;Plain Talk&quot;, which had ceased publication that May. It was expected to be a for-profit operation, and by 1952 it had reached 22,000 subscribers and was almost able to sustain itself. However, internal disagreements over politics destabilized the operation. Chamberlain and La Follette had staked out positions in favor of Senator Joseph McCarthy, a strident crusader against communism, and Senator Robert A. Taft, a candidate in the Republican presidential primary that year. These positions led to conflicts with Hazlitt and members of the board. Hazlitt quit the magazine in October 1952, but by February 1953 both Chamberlain and La Follette had left, and Hazlitt returned as sole editor. He resigned again at the start of 1954.

==Transfer to FEE==
By June 1954 the magazine had lost $400,000 and was on the verge of closure. Rather than let it fold, Read decided to purchase the magazine. He created a new for-profit company, Irvington Press, with FEE as its owner, and Irvington purchased &quot;The Freeman&quot;. He brought in Chodorov, former editor of the unrelated Georgist &quot;Freeman&quot;, as the new editor, starting with the July 1954 issue. Chodorov focused the magazine more on economic issues, taking more explicit libertarian stances than the previous editors. He also promoted a non-interventionist foreign policy, which stirred debate with more traditional conservatives. Although the content was different, the magazine continued to lose money, costing $90,000 in 18 months.

Unable to stop the magazine from losing money, Read turned it over to the non-profit FEE. It became the foundation&#x27;s primary outreach tool. With a new format and a new focus, the magazine became more successful. Within two years it had reached 42,000 subscribers, and FEE&#x27;s donor base had more than doubled.

==Name==
In 1955, FEE introduced a quarterly magazine called &quot;Ideas on Liberty&quot;. When FEE acquired &quot;The Freeman&quot;, the two were merged and named &quot;The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty&quot;. In January 2000, the magazine was renamed &quot;Ideas on Liberty&quot;, although it retained the format and content that it had had since the merger. The dual title was restored with the December 2003 issue. From the October 2012 issue, the magazine was titled just &quot;The Freeman&quot;, with no subtitle. In fall 2015, FEE removed the &quot;Freeman&quot; branding from its web articles, and the &quot;Freeman&quot; referred exclusively to the then-quarterly print magazine.

==Influence==
&quot;The Freeman&quot; is widely considered to be an important forerunner to the conservative publication &quot;National Review&quot; magazine, which was founded in 1955, and which from its inception included many of the same contributing editors.

During its more than half century of publication, &quot;The Freeman&quot; featured articles by economists, businessmen, professors, teachers, statesmen (domestic and foreign), students, housewives, free-lance writers, and budding libertarian intellectuals. Many of its authors went on to become noted authors, teachers, and founders of libertarian organizations.

==Staff==
The editors of &quot;The Freeman&quot; have included Hazlitt, Chamberlain, La Follette, Chodorov, Paul L. Poirot, Brian Summers, Charles Hamilton, and John Robbins. Chamberlain became FEE&#x27;s regular book reviewer and his reviews appeared in &quot;The Freeman&quot; until his death in 1995. As FEE president, Read was also a regular contributor, as was FEE&#x27;s economic adviser, Ludwig von Mises. Other contributors in the 1950s included: Barbara Branden, James Burnham, John Dos Passos, Max Eastman, John T. Flynn, F. A. Hayek, Frank Meyer, Raymond Moley, Roscoe Pound, Wilhelm Röpke, Murray Rothbard, Morrie Ryskind and George Sokolsky.

Writers whose work appeared in &quot;The Freeman&quot; in its final decades included such libertarians as Charles W. Baird, Donald J. Boudreaux, Clarence Carson, Stephen Davies, Richard Epstein, Burton Folsom, Jr., David R. Henderson, Robert Higgs, David Kelley, Tibor Machan, Wendy McElroy, Lawrence W. Reed, George Reisman, Hans Sennholz, Bernard Siegan, John Stossel, George Leef, Thomas Szasz and Walter E. Williams.

On October 15, 2012, FEE announced that Max Borders was taking over as editor, replacing Sheldon Richman, who had been editor since 1997. On September 25, 2015, Borders resigned as editor, and managing editor B.K. Marcus succeeded him as the final editor of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Freeman&quot;. In September 2016, FEE announced that it would cease publication of &quot;The Freeman&quot;.

<doc id="1156864" wikidata="Q2419470" url="?curid=1156864" title="Iago ap Beli">
<text>Iago ap Beli (c. 540 – c. 616) was King of Gwynedd (reigned c. 599 – c. 616). Little is known of him or his kingdom from this early era, with only a few anecdotal mentions of him in historical documents.

Iago ap Beli (Latin: Iacobus Belii filius; ) was the son and successor of King Beli ap Rhun, and is listed in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies and in Jesus College MS. 20. The only other record of him is the note of his death, which occurred in the same year as the Battle of Chester (), with no connection between Iago&#x27;s death and the famous battle, and with no evidence that Gwynedd had any part in the battle. He would be succeeded as king by his son, Cadfan ap Iago.

The 1766 publication of Henry Rowlands&#x27;s &quot;Mona Antiqua Restaurata&quot; says that the archives of the cathedral at Bangor mention Iago as having founded a deanery there (&quot;Iago ap Beli Rex Decanatu Ecclesiam ditavit&quot;). However, the correctness of the archive&#x27;s assertion is challenged in Haddan and William Stubbs&#x27; authoritative &quot;Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents Relating to Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, where it is noted that &quot;the earliest historical testimony to a Dean at Bangor is 1162&quot;.

In the medieval &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;, the death of King Iago ap Beli is described as the result of an axe-blow by one of his own men, a certain Cadafael Wyllt (). In his &quot;Celtic Britain&quot;, John Rhŷs notes that the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; mention Iago&#x27;s death and use the word &quot;dormitat&quot; (or &quot;dormitato&quot;, meaning &quot;sleep&quot; in the sense of a euphemism for death), contradicting the notion of a violent death. Further, as the word &quot;dormitato&quot; was generally used in reference to clerics, it is possible that Iago resigned his kingship and thereafter led a clerical life.

== Geoffrey of Monmouth ==
The largely fictional stories of ancient Britain written by Geoffrey of Monmouth use the names of many historical personages as characters, and the use of these names is a literary convenience made in order to advance the plot of Geoffrey&#x27;s stories. One of these stories uses the names of Iago&#x27;s son Cadfan and other contemporary people, telling of how a certain Edwin spent his exiled youth in Gwynedd, growing up alongside Iago&#x27;s grandson, the future King Cadwallon. There is no historical basis for this story, as is readily acknowledged in the preface of works on the subject.

Nevertheless, a &quot;traditional&quot; story arose blending Geoffrey&#x27;s fiction with known history, implying that the future King Edwin of Northumbria had actually spent his youth in Gwynedd, growing up alongside Iago&#x27;s grandson, the future King Cadwallon. In point of fact, Cadwallon and Edwin were enemies with no known youthful connections: King Edwin invaded Gwynedd and drove King Cadwallon into exile, and it would be Cadwallon, in alliance with Penda of Mercia, who would ultimately defeat and kill Edwin in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase (). The story that they had spent an idyllic youth together may have had a romantic appeal.

What is known from history is that in 588 King Ælla of Deira died, and Æthelfrith of Bernicia took the opportunity to invade and conquer Deira, driving Ælla &#x27;s 3-year old infant son, the future Edwin of Northumbria, into exile. Edwin would eventually ally himself with Rædwald of East Anglia in 616, defeating and killing Æthelfrith and becoming one of Northumbria&#x27;s most successful kings. Edwin&#x27;s life in exile is unknown, and there is no historical basis for placing him in Gwynedd.

<text>Volatile memory, in contrast to non-volatile memory, is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is quickly lost.

Volatile memory has several uses including as primary storage. In addition to usually being faster than forms of mass storage such as a hard disk drive, volatility can protect sensitive information, as it becomes unavailable on power-down. Most general-purpose random-access memory (RAM) is volatile.

==Types==
There are two kinds of volatile RAM: dynamic and static. Even though both types need continuous electrical current to retain data, there are some important differences between them.

Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is very popular due to its cost-effectiveness. DRAM stores each bit of information in a different capacitor within the integrated circuit. DRAM chips need just one single capacitor and one transistor to store each bit of information. This makes it space-efficient and inexpensive.

The main advantage of static RAM (SRAM) is that it is much faster than dynamic RAM. Its disadvantage is its high price. SRAM does not need continuous electrical refreshes, but it still requires constant current to sustain the difference in voltage. Every single bit in a static RAM chip needs a cell of six transistors, whereas dynamic RAM requires only one capacitor and one transistor. As a result, SRAM is unable to accomplish the storage capabilities of the DRAM family. SRAM is commonly used as CPU cache and for processor registers and in networking devices.

<doc id="1156876" wikidata="Q712586" url="?curid=1156876" title="Blind Willie Johnson">
<text>Willie Johnson (January 25, 1897 – September 18, 1945), commonly known as Blind Willie Johnson, was an American gospel blues singer and guitarist. His landmark recordings completed between 1927 and 1930, thirty songs in all, display a combination of powerful chest voice singing, slide guitar skills and originality that has influenced generations of musicians. His records sold well though as a street performer and preacher, he had little wealth in his lifetime. His life was poorly documented, but over time, music historians such as Samuel Charters have uncovered more about him and his five recording sessions.

A revival of interest in Johnson&#x27;s music began in the 1960s following his inclusion on Harry Smith&#x27;s &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot; and by the efforts of the blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. Along with Davis, he has since been considered the dominant player of holy blues music which convey religious themes in a blues style, often with a blues style of guitar accompaniment.

Johnson&#x27;s work has become more accessible through compilation albums such as &quot;American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson&quot; and the Charters compilations. As a result, Johnson is credited as one of the most influential practitioners of the blues and his slide guitar playing, particularly on his hymn Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground, is highly acclaimed. Other recordings by Johnson include Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed, It&#x27;s Nobody&#x27;s Fault but Mine and John the Revelator.

== Biography ==
===Early life and career===
Blind Willie Johnson was born on January 25, 1897, in Pendleton, Texas, a small town near Temple, Texas, to sharecropper Dock Johnson and Mary King. His family, which according to the blues historian Stephen Calt included at least one younger brother (named Carl), moved to the agriculturally rich community of Marlin, where Johnson spent most of his childhood. There, the Johnson family attended church, most likely the Marlin Missionary Baptist Church, every Sunday, a habit that had a lasting impact on Johnson and fueled his desire to be ordained as a Baptist minister. When Johnson was five years old, his father gave him his first instrument, a cigar box guitar.

Johnson was not born blind though he was visually impaired at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight but it is generally agreed by most of his biographers that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson&#x27;s widow, Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie&#x27;s father had violently confronted Willie&#x27;s stepmother about her infidelity and during the argument, she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water permanently blinding him.

Few other details are known about his childhood. At some point, he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a powerful singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson&#x27;s own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners and had a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson but the extent of the two songsters&#x27; involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson began an unregistered marriage with Willis B. Harris who occasionally sang on the street with him and accompanied him on piano at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ. They had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.

===Recording sessions (1927–1930)===

By the time Johnson began his recording career, he was a well-known evangelist with a &quot;remarkable technique and a wide range of songs&quot; as blues historian Paul Oliver notes. On December 3, 1927, Johnson along with Billiken Johnson and Coley Jones got together at a temporary studio that talent scout Frank Buckley Walker had set up in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Dallas to record them for Columbia Records. In the session, Johnson played six songs, 13 takes total. Among the songs he recorded in that day were Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed, It&#x27;s Nobody&#x27;s Fault but Mine, Mother&#x27;s Children Have a Hard Time, Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground, and If I Had My Way I&#x27;d Tear the Building Down&quot;. He was compensated with $50 per usable side, a substantial amount for the period, plus a bonus for forfeiting royalties from the sales of his records.

The first releases were I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole and Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed, on Columbia&#x27;s popular 14000 Race series. His debut was a substantial success as 9,400 copies were pressed, more than the latest release by one of Columbia&#x27;s most established stars, Bessie Smith with an additional pressing of 6,000 copies followed. His fifth recorded song, Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground, the B-side of Johnson&#x27;s second release, best exemplifies his slide guitar playing in open D tuning. For the session, Johnson substituted a knife or penknife for the bottleneck and, according to Harris, he played with a thumb pick. His melancholy humming of the guitar part creates the impression of unison moaning, a style of singing hymns that is common in southern African-American church groups. In 1928, the blues critic Edward Abbe Niles praised Johnson in his column for &quot;The Bookman&quot;, emphasizing his &quot;violent, tortured, and abysmal shouts and groans, and his inspired guitar playing&quot;.

Johnson and Harris returned to Dallas on December 5, 1928 to record I&#x27;m Gonna Run to the City of Refuge, Jesus Is Coming Soon, Lord I Just Can&#x27;t Keep From Crying and Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning. He also recorded two unreleased and untitled tracks under the pseudonym Blind Texas Marlin but those recordings were never recovered. Another year passed before Johnson recorded again, on December 10 and 11, 1929, the longest sessions of his career. He completed ten sides in 16 takes at Werlein&#x27;s Music Store in New Orleans also recording some duets with an unknown female singer who is thought to have been a member of Reverend J. M. Gates&#x27;s congregation. The blind street performer, Dave Ross reported hearing Johnson performing on the street in New Orleans in December of 1929. Jazz historian Richard Allen recalls hearing a story that Johnson was arrested while performing in front of the Custom House on Canal Street for allegedly attempting to incite a riot with his impassioned rendition of If I Had My Way I&#x27;d Tear the Building Down.

For his fifth and final recording session, Johnson journeyed to Atlanta, Georgia along with Harris who added vocal harmonies. They completed ten selections on April 20, 1930. Columbia chose Everybody Ought to Treat a Stranger Right paired with Go with Me to That Land as the first record released from the session. However, the Great Depression had impoverished much of Johnson&#x27;s audience and consequently only 800 copies were pressed. Some of his songs were re-released by Vocalion Records in 1932 but Johnson never recorded again.

===Later life and death===
Johnson allegedly remarried, this time to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s but, as with Harris, it is unlikely that the union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson, undoubtedly Blind Willie, operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street there. In 1945, a fire destroyed their home and, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in its ruins where he was soaked and cold. Standing out in the winter winds the next day, singing to earn a little money, Willie got sick and within a few days was dying of pneumonia. He contracted malarial fever and no hospital would admit him either because of his visual impairment or, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, because he was black. Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.

According to his death certificate, he was buried in Blanchette Cemetery, in Beaumont. The location of the cemetery had been forgotten until it was rediscovered in 2009. His grave site remains unknown but the researchers who identified the cemetery erected a monument there in his honor in 2010. 

==Musical style==
Johnson is considered one of the masters of blues singing and guitar playing particularly in the gospel blues style. Like his contemporary Blind Lemon Jefferson, he channeled the expressiveness of the blues into his religious messages which he took from hymnbooks. Samuel Charters, in the liner notes to the compilation album &quot;The Complete Blind Willie Johnson&quot;, wrote that, in fact, Johnson was not a bluesman in the traditional sense, &quot;but here still is so much similarity between his relentless guitar rhythms and his harsh, insistent voice, and the same fierce intensities of the blues singers, that they become images of each other, seen in the mirror of the society that produced them&quot;.

An important aspect of Johnson&#x27;s recordings was his mastery of bottleneck, slide guitar technique which was influential on Robert Johnson and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. He punctuated his playing with tonal control and a sense of timing, often using the guitar to sing harmony and to fill in lines, as on Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground. By most accounts, including one by the reputable blues guitarist Blind Willie McTell, Johnson used a knife as a slide but other claims by Harris and the bluesman Thom Shaw say he used a thumb pick or brass ring on his recordings. The music historian Steve Calt said of Johnson&#x27;s style, &quot;opposed to other bottleneck artists he varies the speed of his vibrato drastically, often speeding up as he slides into a note. He is also one of the few bottleneck artists with the ability to consistently sound three or four discreet melody notes upon striking a string once, a skill that reflects uncanny left-handed strength, accuracy and agility&quot;.

Johnson sang in a gravelly, falsetto bass voice that was powerful enough for passersby on the streets to hear. His vocal interplay with his guitar was described by the blues writer Mark Makin as &quot;fierce&quot; and &quot;not unlike the &#x27;Hell and Damnation&#x27; of a Baptist preacher such as a fired-up Reverend A. W. Nix&quot;. On some instances in his recordings, Johnson also sang in his natural tenor voice. The only known influence on Johnson&#x27;s singing style is the blind musician Madkin Butler, who, like Johnson, sang his religious message on the streets of Texas cities.

==Legacy==
Johnson&#x27;s music was revived in the 1960s thanks in large part to Harry Smith including his version of &quot;John The Revelator&quot; in the second volume of his &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot;, &quot;Social Music&quot;, along with the three Sam Charters blues collections for Folkways Records, &quot;The Country Blues&quot;, &quot;Rural Blues&quot; and &quot;Blind Willie Johnson: His Story&quot; and blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis, a highly regarded figure in New York&#x27;s folk scene, recording his &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; which the Soul Stirrers, the Staples Singers, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Fairport Convention, and Peter, Paul and Mary covered or re-interpreted. In November 1962, Bob Dylan recorded a rendition of Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed, retitled In My Time of Dying for his self-titled debut album. Rock bands and artists of the 1970s also covered Johnson&#x27;s songs including Led Zeppelin, John Sebastian, and Eric Clapton. In 2016, Alligator Records released the tribute album &quot;God Don&#x27;t Never Change: The Songs of Blind Willie Johnson&quot; produced by Jeffrey Gaskill with covers by various artists including Tom Waits, Lucinda Williams, Sinead O&#x27;Connor and Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi. The album was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Roots Gospel Album and Best American Roots Performance for Blind Boys of Alabama recording of Mother&#x27;s Children Have a Hard Time.

All of Johnson&#x27;s released material has become easily available thanks to compilation albums such as &quot;Blind Willie Johnson 1927–1930&quot; and &quot;The Complete Blind Willie Johnson&quot;, among others. Samuel Charters was the first major blues historian to attempt to uncover more about Johnson&#x27;s life, first documenting him in his 1959 book &quot;The Country Blues&quot;. In 1993, Charters corrected some factual inaccuracies in Johnson&#x27;s biography in the liner notes to &quot;The Complete Blind Willie Johnson&quot;. Other books related to Johnson include &quot;Shine a Light: My Year with Blind Willie Johnson&quot; and &quot;Revelation The Blind Willie Johnson Biography&quot;.

In 1977, Carl Sagan and a team of researchers were tasked with collecting a representation of the human experience here on Earth and sending it into space on the Voyager probe for other life forms in the universe. Among the 27 songs selected for the Voyager Golden Record, NASA consultant Timothy Ferris chose &quot;Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground&quot; because, according to Ferris, &quot;Johnson&#x27;s song concerns a situation he faced many times: nightfall with no place to sleep. Since humans first appeared on Earth, the shroud of night has yet to fall without touching a man or woman in the same plight&quot;. In 2010, the Library of Congress also selected the recording as an addition to the National Recording Registry which annually selects recordings that they deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2017, the story of Blind Willie Johnson&#x27;s inclusion on the Voyager probe was told in the multi-award-winning documentary series &quot;American Epic&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon. A compilation album, &quot;American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson&quot;, accompanied the film and featured radically improved restorations of sixteen of Johnson&#x27;s recordings.

<text>Hornibrook Bridge is a heritage-listed mostly-demolished road bridge on the Hornibrook Highway over Hays Inlet at Bramble Bay from Brighton, City of Brisbane to Clontarf, City of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Manuel Hornibrook and built from 1932 to 1935 by Manuel Hornibrook. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 October 1994.

Handsome art-deco concrete abutment arches frame the entry and exit approaches. Construction of the bridge was important for the growth of the Redcliffe City peninsula and made the commute to Brisbane shorter and quicker, increasing population growth and the number of visitors to the seaside location. The bridge was known colloquially by the locals as the &quot;Humpity Bump&quot; because the road surface of the bridge was so buckled. During king tides, waves would crash into (and sometimes onto) the bridge spraying the cars as they crossed.

The bridge was operated and maintained by a private company and a toll applied until 1975, with toll booths located on the Clontarf (north) end.

The Hornibrook Bridge was the first of three bridges to cross Bramble Bay. The second bridge is the publicly funded (non-tolled) Houghton Highway bridge, which was built with the intention of duplicating the crossing capacity of the two-lane Hornibrook Bridge in the 1970s, but the upgrading of the original Hornibrook Bridge was subsequently found to be uneconomic. The bridge closed to traffic in 1979 with the opening of the Houghton Highway, which had been intended to provide a duplicated crossing. The third bridge, the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in July 2010, delivering the desired capacity increase and resulting in the demolition of the original Hornibrook Bridge, which had been used as a pedestrian and bicycle only bridge since 1979.

==History==

The Hornibrook Highway Bridge was constructed in the years 1932–1935, by the firm of M.R. Hornibrook. Conceived as a response to high unemployment during the Great Depression, it also represented an opportunity to end the isolation of the residents of the Redcliffe Peninsula.

Prior to the construction of the Hornibrook Viaduct, the Redcliffe Peninsula was accessed via two main methods of transport: ferry and road. Road transportation in particular was of great concern to the residents of the Redcliffe area. During times of wet weather, the Redcliffe road running via Petrie regularly became impassable to vehicles.

Several schemes had been drafted to improve the accessibility of the Redcliffe area to vehicle owners and also to the growing day-tripper market, having seaside holidays at Redcliffe. These schemes favoured the construction of a new road link across Hays Inlet and the mouth of the South Pine River. In 1926, the Redcliffe Town Council had proposed such a project be considered by the Main Roads Board.

Such a road link would involve crossing of water by viaduct at a cost of . This road would then connect with the main road from Sandgate to Brisbane, avoiding the long drive via Petrie. M.R. Hornibrook had holidayed in this area and saw the development potential of the Redcliffe area being linked by road to Brisbane. The onset of the financial depression of 1929–1933 gave Hornibrook the impetus to plan and construct a road viaduct across from Redcliffe to Sandgate.

Major contracts for construction diminished with the deepening depression, and the decline in public spending. Hornibrook believed a major project was needed to keep together the construction force built up by his company during twenty-five years of work.

In 1931, Hornibrook approached the Queensland Government with a proposal to construct a toll bridge linking the southern part of Redcliffe with the Sandgate area. Initially, this proposal was rejected. After further consultation with the Queensland Government, an Act of Parliament was pushed through allowing for the involvement of private enterprise in the construction of toll facilities. Note that the Queensland Government was also in discussions with Walter Taylor regarding his proposal to construct a toll bridge (later known as the Walter Taylor Bridge) across the Brisbane River between Indooroopilly and Chelmer.

The terms of the contract with the Queensland Government set the toll price, as well as stipulating the length of lease. Hornibrook negotiated successfully for a forty-year lease on the projected road bridge.

The full extent of the project involved a road viaduct in length plus associated roadworks. To finance such a major construction, a prospectus was issued to encourage local investment in Hornibrook Highway Ltd.

Work officially commenced on the project on 8 June 1932, but in its first eighteen months progress was limited, due to a lack of financing. The entry portals at either end of the bridge were completed in early 1933. Continuing financial difficulties forced Hornibrook to attempt to re-finance the company to finish the work as planned by 1935. The major flotation was assisted by a loan from the AMP Society, guaranteed by the Queensland Government. Work recommenced at a faster pace from July 1934.

The portals were designed by architect John Beebe. Originally a Bendigo-based architect, Beebe moved to Queensland in 1916, and worked at the Queensland Works Department until 1926. He then moved into private practice in Brisbane until 1936.

Over 2.5 million superfeet of timber was needed to provide girders and decking on the bridge. Two sawmills were bought specially to process timber from Mount Mee and Conondale Range. 250 timbergetters were employed to cut the required amount of timber. Timber for the construction of the bridge was transported down the North Pine and Pine rivers on barges. The hardwood used in piles and girders mostly came from a timber mill owned by the Hornibrook Construction Company at Mapleton, transported from there to Nambour on the Mapleton Tramway, and then by Queensland Rail trains.

Concrete was supplied from the QCL works at Darra - the two portals being the first significant structures in Queensland to use material from this source.

The last plank on the viaduct was spiked into place on 7 September 1935. The bitumen road surface was laid in under three weeks setting an Australian record. The bridge originally had two traffic lanes and a pedestrian footpath. The construction of the bridge was similar to other bridges in Queensland, but when it was completed it was the longest road viaduct built over water in the Southern Hemisphere. At the time of completion, the bridge had a length of . It was the longest bridge in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second longest in the world after the Maestri Bridge in the United States. Up until its closure to road traffic in 1979, it was the longest vehicular traffic bridge in Australia.

The viaduct was opened to road traffic on 4 October 1935, foreshortening the road journey by several hours. Also a special coordinated road/rail bus service was inaugurated by the company to convey commuters between Sandgate and Redcliffe.

It was officially opened by then Queensland Premier Arthur Edward Moore on 4 October 1935. It was named after Sir Manuel Hornibrook, the chief engineer of the project.

The Hornibrook Highway played an important strategic role during the defence of Australia in World War Two. Military road convoys were able to use the highway to move war material efficiently to points in Queensland.

The Hornibrook Highway franchise was surrendered to the Department of Main Roads in 1975 after forty years of operation by the company. From this time the Main Roads Department assumed responsibility for maintaining the structure. By then, the increasing road volumes necessitated the investigation of carrying additional traffic. An additional viaduct was authorised by the Main Roads Department in 1977 to cope with increasing traffic flows to and from the Redcliffe Peninsula. The Houghton Highway as the new bridge was named opened to traffic in 1979. The publicly funded (non-tolled) Houghton Highway bridge was built alongside the Hornibrook Bridge, with the intention of duplicating the capacity. The project had intended to upgrade the Hornibrook Bridge as part of that project, but was subsequently found to be uneconomic. The Hornibrook Bridge was closed to traffic in 1979 with the opening of the Houghton Highway bridge.

From 1979, the Hornibrook Bridge was only used as a pedestrian and bicycle bridge, providing the only pedestrian and cycling link between the northern suburbs of Brisbane and the Redcliffe Peninsula. It also became a popular site for recreation and fishing. Although the bridge was heritage-listed in 1994, concerns arose about the cost of ongoing maintenance and whether the Queensland Government or local councils should pay for it.

An additional (third) bridge, the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in July 2010, delivering the desired capacity increase as well as providing pedestrian and cyclist access. As the Hornibrook Bridge was then no longer needed for pedestrian and cyclist access, it was closed on 14 July 2010. Before its closure, the Hornibrook Bridge was the longest footbridge in the world. Subsequently, the Poughkeepsie Bridge, located in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States, became the world&#x27;s longest footbridge.

Despite the heritage listing of the Hornibrook Bridge in 1994, safety concerns about the rotting deck timbers led to the decision to demolish most of the bridge in mid 2011, retaining the north and south portals and of bridge at the northern end for use by fishermen. The northern end of the bridge was officially reopened on 14 September 2011 as the Hays Inlet Fishing and Recreation Platform by Craig Wallace, Minister for Main Roads, Fisheries and Marine Infrastructure.

The Hornibrook Highway was a major catalyst in accelerating the urban development of the Redcliffe Peninsula and its surrounding area. In its planning, construction and operation it represented a major innovation in construction activities in Queensland at a time of economic crisis.

== Description ==

The Hornibrook Highway Bridge was a long timber and concrete bridge that spanned Hays Inlet and Bramble Bay between Clontarf and Brighton, linking Sandgate to Redcliffe. It had identical rendered concrete portals at each end, and two rises along its length which permit small boats to pass underneath.

The bridge construction comprised a timber superstructure supported by reinforced concrete piers with three concrete piles of varying depths. The superstructure had substantial round ironbark girders on corbels, with girders supporting large section ironbark and tallowwood sawn decking. The decking was covered with coarse aggregate bitumen, and had concrete kerb edging. At each end, the first spans of the superstructure were constructed in ribbed reinforced concrete to protect the bridge from termites and fire.

The superstructure had a slight camber that permits periodic tightening of the deck via bolt fixings along the outer girders. The bridge had steel balustrades comprising steel stanchions supporting two circular hollow section rails and ironbark lightpoles along its length.

The portals at each end (which still exist) are finely detailed monumental Art Deco structures comprising substantial pylons spanned by a deep spandrel facing landward, and more modestly detailed rectangular frames facing bayward. The pylons have banded rusticated bases on concrete pedestals, with central slot windows with decorative grilles on three sides, surmounted by stepped vertical elements. The spandrel is also banded, and has a rectangular central panel with the words &quot;Hornibrook Highway&quot; fashioned in raised brass lettering. The portals contain toll facilities, comprising a small office and strong room with night safe in the base of the pylons at each end. Externally these rooms are framed by Art Deco relief patterns. On the approach to the bridge the portals are preceded by smaller free-standing pylons either side of the road.

<text>The Houghton Highway is a reinforced concrete viaduct, the second bridge to be built across Hays Inlet at Bramble Bay connecting the cities of Redcliffe and Brisbane in Queensland, Australia (the first bridge was the Hornibrook Bridge). The bridge, along with the third bridge, the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge, were the longest bridges in the country until 27 March 2013, when the Macleay River Bridge opened in Kempsey, NSW.

Originally built to duplicate the crossing capacity, almost immediately after opening it was converted to a three lane roadway with &#x27;peak flow&#x27; lane control as a result of the proposed upgrading of the Hornibrook Bridge being deemed uneconomic. The intended crossing capacity was finally provided with the opening of the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge in 2010.

==History==
With rising traffic levels on the two-lane Hornibrook Bridge in the 1970s, the Department of Main Roads investigated the construction of another structure to increase capacity and cope with future demand. Authorisation by the department was given to construct a new bridge in 1977, and the new Houghton Highway opened on 20 December 1979, by the then Premier of Queensland, The Hon Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

The Houghton Highway is named after The Hon James &#x27;Jim&#x27; Houghton, Member for Redcliffe (1960–1979) and speaker (1974–1979). Houghton resigned from parliament on 7 August, four months before the bridge opened.

==Design==
The all-concrete Houghton Highway consists of 99 spans atop of some 400 T-beams, supported close to sea level by headstocks connected to five octagonal piles each.

===Rough ride===

A notable characteristic of the Houghton Highway until 2010, other than its significant length, was the particularly rough surface and therefore ride quality. Each concrete span has a slight concave curve, so a distinct corrugated ride was felt when driving over the bridge. These ride characteristics were due to the absence of a bitumen overlay prior to 2010, when the bridge was upgraded in conjunction with the construction of the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge.

===Worst road recognition===
In February 2004, an RACQ survey recognised the Houghton Highway as the number one &quot;pain in the neck&quot; with Queensland motorists. Some 1200 members responded to the survey, asking them to nominate problem roads and intersections in the state. Respondents identified problems including insufficient capacity, the tidal flow or an accident/breakdown on the bridge causing major congestion, an inappropriate speed limit (), and the lack of consideration given by authorities to another bridge crossing.

==Original layout and intention==
The original intention of the Houghton Highway was to provide two lanes of southbound traffic, with the Hornibrook Bridge to be refurbished to provide two lanes of northbound traffic, doubling original capacity. When the Houghton Highway opened, it initially provided one lane in each direction, intended to temporarily replace the Hornibrook Bridge while its proposed refurbishment was conducted.

The initial deck layout (from west to east) consisted of two lanes, an shoulder or &quot;breakdown lane&quot;, and a footway. With just a diminutive reinforced concrete kerb to separate pedestrians from passing traffic, the use of the footway was minimal. The bridge had a southbound breakdown lane, on the basis that the two-way traffic flow was only meant to be temporary.

With the Hornibrook Bridge closed for refurbishment, engineers were able to make a closer examination to determine more clearly the extent of work required. They found that deterioration of the bridge was worse than first expected, and the cost to bring the bridge up to an acceptable standard, and its continued maintenance, would be far greater than original predictions. At the same time, the state government believed that Redcliffe&#x27;s future growth would be in its western areas, and therefore the connections of Redcliffe to the Bruce Highway should receive more attention – the original land-based and much longer route to Brisbane before the Hornibrook Bridge opened in 1935.

==Increasing capacity with just one bridge==
With the proposed refurbishment of the Hornibrook Bridge cancelled, in October 1982 the Department of Main Roads investigated modification of the Houghton Highway, only ten months after it opened. Facing an unintended situation where the new bridge as built would not deliver any increased capacity, the modification of the bridge was completed within twelve months.

The modifications involved the removal of the pedestrian footway, addition of a third lane and a tidal flow arrangement to provide two lanes for peak traffic flow – southbound in the morning and northbound in the afternoon and evening (reversed on weekends). As breakdown lanes could not be provided, emergency telephones and overhead lighting were also fitted to the bridge at the same time. The Houghton Highway did not originally include overhead lighting, whereas the old bridge did.

Modifications to the bridge commenced in March 1982, and were completed by 3 September the same year, at a total cost of $435,000. The upgrade included six gantries, eight switchable message signs, 54 traffic signals, two mast arms, 51 overhead lights, 12 emergency telephones, of power cable and of communication cable.

==Cracking and deterioration==
A routine inspection of Houghton Highway in 1991 found an alkali-silica reaction in the pre-stressed concrete piles. This reaction caused internal cracking of the concrete, and crumbling and spalling of the concrete leaving the reinforcing steel exposed to the marine environment.

Approximately 500 piles were encased in concrete below the water surface and up to above the high water level. Above this point, an externally bonded carbon fibre reinforced polymer was applied, wrapping the column to cover the damage and contain and conceal the existing cracks. It was also believed that such composites offered re-strengthening and a protection of the piles through encapsulated resin during the lamination.

The treatment work was completed in 2000, and the repairs and condition of the piles are continually monitored.

==Upgrading and political controversy==
Increasing traffic resulted in the bridge reaching its upgraded capacity in the late 1990s. In particular, vehicle breakdowns or accidents that resulted in the temporary closure of one or more lanes causing congestion and delays demonstrated the vulnerability of the situation.

===Tidal flow upgrade===
The Department of Main Roads undertook a further upgrade of the bridge&#x27;s tidal flow system. Commissioned in 2002 at a cost of $1.8 million, this upgrade included the replacement of the overhead arrow and cross signals with brighter, LED displays, monitoring of traffic flows and conditions with supervision of the system data and view of the bridge by CCTV at the remote Traffic Management Centre in Woolloongabba, Brisbane. Operators were for the first time also able to close and open lanes as required from the remote location.

The upgrade project suffered delays from &quot;technical issues&quot;, resulting in the then Transport and Main Roads Minister, The Hon Steve Bredhauer, thanking Redcliffe residents for their patience. Six months later, the Minister apologised for extensive delays after the system failed when a council contractor cut both the main and back-up power supplies to the tidal flow system just before 10:00am. Evening peak hour traffic was severely disrupted and banked-up for several kilometres as the bridge fell into &quot;safe mode&quot; with one lane open in each direction for over 10 hours until Energex reconnected power at 8:00pm. Changes implemented after this incident included an improved back-up power supply that was separate from the main supply, tighter controls on works near the bridge requiring approval by the Department of Main Roads, and a variable message sign on the Gateway Motorway at Deagon to warn motorists of delays and suggest taking the longer, western route to Redcliffe via the Bruce Highway.

===Reduced speed limit===
In 2003 the speed limit was reduced from to . The reduced speed limit also included a approach to the southern end of the bridge along mostly four-lane Deagon Deviation dual carriageway. This approach was previously 80 km/h along with the bridge, and became 60 km/h with it. The stated reason behind the reduced speed limit was to reduce crash incidents, therefore reducing delays and blockages.

The reduced speed limit was initially trialled for nine months from September 2003 until June 2004, then extended for a further six months. The Redcliffe City Council did not support a 60 km/h speed limit trial, and requested the Minister for Transport and Main Roads to reduce the trial period to three months. The Minister replied, committed to the nine-month trial.

In November 2004, the state government declared the trial a success, using data that showed only three crashes in the nine-month trial period. The data did not include vehicle breakdowns on the bridge that would have involved delays from blocked lanes. Prior to the permanent speed limit being announced, a four-vehicle crash occurred with a motorist trapped in her car, closing the bridge in the evening peak for three hours, and again caused banked-up traffic for several kilometres and forced motorists to take the longer western route via the Bruce Highway.

===Political considerations===
Labor&#x27;s Ray Hollis won the seat of Redcliffe in the 1989 election of the Goss government and, except for a slim 0.5% lead in 1995, the seat of Redcliffe built-up with a safe Labor majority of 13.7% in 2001.

Continuing disquiet about the bridge capacity, and calls for it to be duplicated or replaced, were persistently rejected by the government – a media statement titled &quot;Call for second bridge rejected&quot; was issued by the Transport and Main Roads Minister on 11 July 2003. However, three months later the then Queensland Premier, The Hon Peter Beattie, issued a statement announcing a study into when a new Redcliffe bridge &quot;might&quot; be built. A reason for this change of stance included campaigning by the Redcliffe City Council and a study they commissioned into the duplication of the bridge, frustrated by the apparent lack of interest in the matter by the state government.

Just over two months later, a state election was called, earlier than anticipated, for 7 February 2004. During the election campaign, the Liberal candidate, Terry Rogers, raised the issue of a new bridge to Redcliffe, and Hollis suffered a 10.5% swing but held on to the now-marginal seat. Suddenly a new bridge became a &quot;need&quot; for Redcliffe.

In the next year, Hollis became involved in two scandals and the opposition called for his resignation. When the state government announced the duplication of the Houghton Highway in April 2005, the opposition suspected that Hollis was going to resign and stepped up their campaign against him. Hollis resigned for health reasons in July triggering a by-election, and the promise of a new bridge was made by both parties; the government announced it had already started the survey and public consultation phase. The Liberal candidate, once again Terry Rogers, won the 20 August by-election, while Labor won the seat back in 2006.

==Highway duplication==
The duplication of the Houghton Highway consisted of a new bridge named the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge. It was officially completed on 11 July 2010 and open to southbound traffic on 15 July 2010.

After the opening of the Ted Smout Memorial bridge, the Houghton Highway was upgraded with a bitumen overlay and new variable speed limit signs. The reduced speed limit was lifted on 19 August 2011, returning to the original . This marked the completion of its rejuvenation and, with the new bitumen surface, an improved ride quality was provided 31 years after it opened.

<doc id="1156888" wikidata="Q206212" url="?curid=1156888" title="Warsaw Citadel">
<text>Warsaw Citadel (Polish: Cytadela Warszawska) is a 19th-century fortress in Warsaw, Poland. It was built by order of Tsar Nicholas I after the suppression of the 1830 November Uprising in order to bolster imperial Russian control of the city. It served as a prison into the late 1930s, especially the dreaded Tenth Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel (&quot;X Pawilon Cytadeli Warszawskiej&quot;); the latter has been a museum since 1963.

== History ==
The Citadel was built by personal order of Tsar Nicholas I after the 1830 November Uprising. Its chief architect, Major General Johan Jakob von Daehn (&quot;Ivan Dehn&quot;), used the plan of the Antwerp Citadel as the basis for his own plan (the same that was demolished by the French later that year). The cornerstone was laid by Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich, &quot;de facto&quot; viceroy of Congress Poland.

The fortress is a pentagon-shaped brick structure with high outer walls, enclosing an area of 36 hectares. Its construction required the demolition of 76 residential buildings and the forcible resettlement of 15,000 inhabitants.
Work on it commenced May 31, 1832, on the site of a demolished monastery and of the estate of &quot;Fawory&quot;. Officially it ended May 4, 1834, to mark the 18th birthday of Russian Crown Prince Alexander, for whom it was named. In reality, however, the fortress was not completed until 1874. The cost of construction came to 11 million rubles (roughly 8.5 tonnes of pure gold or 128 million euro at today&#x27;s&#x27; prices), a colossal sum by 19th-century standards, and was borne entirely by the city of Warsaw and the Bank Polski, as yet another punishment for the failed uprising.

In peacetime, some 5,000 Russian troops were stationed there. During the 1863 January Uprising, the garrison was reinforced to over 16,000. By 1863 the fortress housed 555 artillery pieces of various calibers, and could cover most of the city center with artillery fire.

About the fortress, 104 prison casemates were built, providing cells for 2,940, mostly political, prisoners. Most notably, is included the Tenth Pavilion. The list of Poles imprisoned and/or executed there up through World War I includes many notable patriots and revolutionaries: Apollo Korzeniowski, writer, political activist and father of Joseph Conrad; Romuald Traugutt, leader of the 1863 January Uprising; Jarosław Dąbrowski, later military chief of the 1871 Paris Commune; Feliks Dzierżyński, a leader of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and founder of the Cheka secret police; the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary, Róża Luksemburg; the future Marshal of Poland, Józef Piłsudski; Piłsudski&#x27;s political archrival, Roman Dmowski; and Eligiusz Niewiadomski, assassin of Poland&#x27;s first president, Gabriel Narutowicz. The Citadel&#x27;s Tenth Pavilion has, since 1963, served as a museum.

Well before the turn of the 20th century, it was apparent that such traditional fortifications had been made obsolete by modern rifled artillery. The Tsarist authorities had planned in 1913 to raze the fortress, but the process had not begun before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915 Warsaw was occupied by German forces with little opposition from the Russian garrison, which abandoned the fortress and withdrew east. The Germans blew up several of its structures, but the main part of the Citadel remained intact and German forces performed a mass execution of 42 people in 1916.

After Poland regained her independence in 1918, the Citadel was taken over by the Polish Army. It was used as a garrison, infantry training center, and depot for materiel. During the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, the Citadel&#x27;s German garrison prevented linking between the city center and the northern Żoliborz district. The fortress survived the war and in 1945 became again Polish Army property.

<doc id="1156909" wikidata="Q17141555" url="?curid=1156909" title="Toxic Audio">
<text>Toxic Audio (known as Vox Audio outside the Orlando area) is a five-person a cappella singing group from Orlando, Florida. They began with appearances at the Orlando International Fringe Festival in the late 1990s. Frequent appearances at the Jazz Club in Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s Downtown Disney have increased their fame. They have released several CDs and performed live, including a run off Broadway in 2004 and tours in Europe and Japan. They have also performed at The Loft, in Dayton, Ohio.

Toxic Audio is popular for their dynamic and humorous performances, which often include audience participation. They are also adept at improvisation. They emphasize that all of the music and sound effects created in their performances are done entirely with their voices; no outside instruments are used. Five Toxic Audio albums have been released on CD with the addition of their new CD, &quot;Voice Activated&quot; in May 2012.

The group consists of five primary singers:

*Michelle Mailhot-Valines, soprano. Her specialty is scat singing.
*Shalisa James, alto. Her specialty is in knowing the exact lyrics to a vast number of songs.
*Paul Sperrazza, tenor. He does beatboxing and is known as the &quot;human beat box&quot; who imitates percussion.
*Jeremy James, baritone. He is skilled at rapping.
*René Ruiz, bass, the founder and original director of the group.

Other singers have been substituted on rare occasion.

John Valines III is the group&#x27;s technical director and audio engineer.

The group&#x27;s New York show, &quot;Loud Mouth&quot;, earned them the 2004 Drama Desk Award.

As of September 2005 the group performed at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, NV.

Toxic Audio performed the song &quot;Electric Blues&quot; at the Hair Actor&#x27;s Benefit Fund Concert in NYC

==Critical notices==
Writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Lawrence Van Gelder complimented and criticised the group: 
&quot;The voices of the five versatile and appealing singers are aided and abetted by an assortment of microphones as they work way through numbers like &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; &quot;Dream a Little Dream,&quot; &quot;Paperback Writer,&quot; &quot;Thriller,&quot; &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and television theme songs. The selection is sure-fire, the presentation is frequently clever, and the cast is talented. But at bottom &quot;Toxic Audio in Loudmouth&quot; is the musical equivalent of a one-joke comedy.&quot;

<doc id="1156910" wikidata="Q1208212" url="?curid=1156910" title="Pedestrian scramble">
<text>A pedestrian scramble (or exclusive pedestrian interval) is a type of traffic signal movement that temporarily stops all vehicular traffic, thereby allowing pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.

In Canada and the United States, the pedestrian scramble was first used in the late 1940s but fell out of favor with traffic engineers due to increased delays for pedestrians and drivers. Its benefits for pedestrian flow and safety have led to new examples being installed in many countries in recent years, including the world&#x27;s busiest pedestrian intersection at Shibuya, Tokyo which began operation in 1973.

Names for the crossings in specific countries include scramble intersection and scramble corner (Canada), &#x27;X&#x27; Crossing (UK), diagonal crossing and Barnes Dance (US), and (Japan).

==Development==

The name &quot;Barnes Dance&quot; commemorates traffic engineer Henry Barnes while alluding to a barn dance. While he did not claim to have invented it himself, Barnes was a strong advocate of it, having observed the difficulties his daughter experienced on her way to school. He first introduced it in his home city of Denver in the late 1940s. Around that time, the pedestrian scramble was being tested separately in Kansas City and Vancouver. Barnes later brought it to Baltimore and New York City. When he became traffic commissioner of New York City in 1962, his first action was to look for intersections to implement pedestrian scrambles. The first pedestrian scramble was installed ten days after he took office at the intersection of Vanderbilt Avenue and 42nd Street, to great acclaim. After the success of the first scramble, Barnes began adding more scrambles across the city, at Wall Street; 42nd Street at Fifth Avenue and at Madison Avenue; and in Brooklyn.

In his autobiography &quot;The Man With the Red and Green Eyes&quot; (1965), Barnes recalled that a City Hall reporter, John Buchanan, coined a phrase (dancing in the streets) writing that &quot;Barnes has made the people so happy they&#x27;re dancing in the streets.&quot; Barnes said later, &quot;As things stood now, a downtown shopper needed a four-leaf clover, a voodoo charm, and a St. Christopher&#x27;s medal to make it in one piece from one curbstone to the other. As far as I was concerned—a traffic engineer with Methodist leanings—I didn&#x27;t think that the Almighty should be bothered with problems which we, ourselves, were capable of solving.&quot;

However, the Barnes Dance—officially known as an &quot;exclusive pedestrian interval&quot; because vehicular traffic is stopped in all directions during a pedestrian scramble—caused gridlock in some cities where it was implemented such as New York City, where congestion increased due to longer wait times for lights. Robert Moses disliked the scrambles because they held up traffic. In locations like Washington, D.C., pedestrian scrambles shorten the time allotted to each traffic-signal phase by one-third. One study of exclusive pedestrian intervals in Greenwich, Connecticut, found that it offered no extra benefits compared to a &quot;concurrent pedestrian interval&quot; where pedestrians cross when parallel traffic has the green light. In the United States, the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices allows pedestrian scrambles.

== Application ==
===In Australia===
In Adelaide, there are scrambles at either end of Rundle Mall, King William Street, another on Pulteney Street, and one at the intersection of King William Street, Waymouth Street and Pirie Street. In Brisbane, there are two noteworthy scrambles: one in the central business district at the intersection of Adelaide and Edward streets, adjacent to the Queen Street Mall, and a second at the intersection of Vulture and Boundary streets in the suburb of West End. In Darwin, there is a pedestrian scramble at the CBD end of the Smith Street Mall.

In Melbourne, there is a pedestrian scramble at the intersection of Flinders and Elizabeth streets, at the Elizabeth Street entrance to Flinders Street railway station, allowing pedestrians to walk directly to the station and the island tram platforms in the middle of both streets. Since 2019, there has been a four-way scramble at the intersection of Wellington Street and Charles Street in Kew, due to school pedestrian traffic through the intersection. A third scramble is at the intersection of Irving and Leeds streets, Footscray, next to Footscray railway station.

In Albury, there is a long-standing four-way scramble at the busiest CBD intersection, Dean Street and Kiewa Street. In Perth, pedestrian scrambles are mostly found in the CBD shopping area, at the intersections between two of Barrack, Hay, Murray and William streets. They are also found at the CBD intersections of St Georges Terrace, Mount and Milligan streets, and where St Georges Terrace becomes Adelaide Terrace at Victoria Avenue. The inner suburb of Mount Lawley has one where Beaufort Street intersects Walcott Street, and there is one in Leederville, at the intersection of Oxford and Vincent streets.

In Sydney, there are numerous examples of scramble crossings in built-up commercial and CBD areas, such as the intersection of George and Druitt streets, with one of the corner blocks being the Sydney Town Hall, at Oxford Street and Bourke Street in Darlinghurst, at Church Street in Parramatta, and in Penrith and Fairfield central business districts.

=== In Belgium ===
Pedestrian scrambles are planned to be legally introduced in autumn 2025.

=== In Canada ===

Vancouver was one of the first cities worldwide to use the concept at individual locations. London, Ontario, had a scramble crossing in the 1960s at the intersection of Clarence and King streets. In Toronto, the intersection of Yonge Street and Dundas Street, the location of Yonge-Dundas Square, has the city&#x27;s first installed scramble intersection and has since been joined by two more on Bloor Street at Yonge and Bay Streets in the downtown area. In 2015, Toronto has eliminated the Bay and Bloor scramble crossing after an evaluation study found &#x27;modest positive benefits for pedestrians&#x27; and &#x27;negative impacts to vehicular traffic&#x27;. The staff report also noted that sideswipe collisions at Bay and Bloor have more than doubled and rear-end type crashes have increased by 50% “likely due to increased driver frustration”. Kingston, Ontario, has a scramble crosswalk at the corners of Union Street and University Avenue to increase the safety of Queen&#x27;s University students. Calgary has two pedestrian scrambles in the Eau Claire neighbourhood. St. Albert, Alberta, has installed a test pedestrian scramble as of the end of May 2017. Edmonton has four as part of a pilot project, with plans for a fifth by early December. Quebec City and Banff also have a few pedestrian scramble intersections. Many intersections in Montreal, especially near downtown, activate the walk signal in all four directions at the same time, effectively creating pedestrian scrambles.

=== In China ===
Shanghai as of 2018, has 11 major intersections equipped with pedestrian scrambles across the city in busy commercial areas. Beijing opened its first pedestrian scramble at the intersection of Lugu West Street and Zhengda Road in 2018. Two pedestrian scrambles opened in Haikou in 2019. Guangzhou has two pedestrian scrambles as of 2019. Pedestrian scrambles also exist in Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Changzhou, Nantong and Yichang. Hong Kong has numerous intersections operating with an exclusive pedestrian interval but not timed for the longer diagonal crossings and are not marked as such. Diagonal crossing at these de facto scramble crossings is illegal in Hong Kong.

=== In Finland ===
A pedestrian scramble appeared after some repairs in Turku&#x27;s main square, between Eerikinkatu and Aurakatu.

===In Japan===

Pedestrian scrambles, known as a , are very common in Japan, where there are more than over 300 such intersections. Japan&#x27;s largest and most famous scramble crossing is found in Tokyo, outside Shibuya station which was inaugurated in 1973. Over 3,000 pedestrians can cross in one scramble and has become a symbol of Tokyo and Japan as a whole. Sukiyabashi in Ginza is another large scramble crossing in Tokyo.

Kansai has many pedestrian scrambles, including four outside the north exit of Kyoto Station alone. Most of the diagonal crossings in Osaka are located in the south of the city, in Abeno ward.

The first pedestrian scramble to be installed in Japan was in the Kyushu city of Kumamoto in 1969. The scramble is located in the Kokaihonmachi district of the city&#x27;s Chuo ward.

=== In Luxembourg ===
In the southern town of Dudelange, there is a pedestrian scramble at the busy intersection of the route de Kayl, route de Luxembourg and rue Gaffelt.

=== In Malaysia ===
Since June 2021, the local municipal and authority of capital Kuala Lumpur has created a Shibuya-style pedestrian crossing at the junction of Bukit Bintang, located in front of the iconic McDonald&#x27;s Bukit Bintang outlet, just below the KL Monorail Line. This was done to increase the walkability in the area.

=== In Mexico ===
In downtown Tijuana diagonal pedestrian crossing with its own signal in the cycle has been applied at numerous intersections for decades. Currently the symbol to indicate pedestrian scramble is possible is a ribbon. In 2019 Mexico City installed its first pedestrian scramble in the Historic Center (Centro Histórico).

===In the Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, a version of the crossing, called a Simultaneous Green light for Bicyclists, combined with an all way green light for pedestrians, is currently being used in a number of intersections in the North and East of the Netherlands.

===In New Zealand===
Inspired by cities in North America, New Zealand began installing Barnes Dances in 1958, with the first being on Queen Street, Auckland, and soon in other cities as well. The Queen Street examples are Custom Street, Shortland, Wyndham, Victoria, and Wellesley Street intersections.

Over the next decade, Barnes Dance junctions became less popular, since they increased automobile congestion more than traditional pedestrian crossings did.

The Queen Street crossings remain today, despite early 2000s attempts to remove them for greater car priority, and have been extended with greater numbers of phases and pedestrian green times during the late 2000s.

Additionally, some Barnes Dance intersections do not provide painted crossings and are therefore de facto, such as the intersection of Grafton Rd and Symonds St within the University of Auckland city campus. Karangahape Road had two such crossings–the Queen Street / K Road intersection was modified in the 1990s but the Pitt Street / K Road intersection is still a Barnes Dance. On nearby Ponsonby Road there is a Barnes Dance at Franklin Road and there is a one on the Great North Road at the Surrey Crescent intersection with Williamson Avenue. There is a Barnes Dance at the multiple street intersection of Lake Road, Hurstmere Road, Northcroft Street and The Strand in Takapuna.

Barnes Dances also existed in several other cities in New Zealand, but have been gradually phased out. Barnes Dances exist in the South Island on Stafford Street in Timaru and three in the Christchurch CBD.

==== Dunedin ====
Dunedin had introduced Barnes Dance junctions by late 1960s, with all of them eventually being removed by the 1980s, with the last being removed at Cargill&#x27;s Corner in South Dunedin.

In 2018, following growing pedestrian traffic in the city centre and &quot;less than enviable&quot; pedestrian and cyclist safety, as well as an existing need to do maintenance on traffic signals, Dunedin City Council announced the return of the Barnes Dance to the city. The initial plan proposed eight crossings, with more to be added depending on reception. Two more were quickly built. As of 2024, there are at least 13 Barnes Dance junctions in the city.

=== In the Philippines ===
In Taguig, there are two known pedestrian scrambles both in Bonifacio Global City: at the intersection of 30th Street and 3rd Avenue, and at the intersection of McKinley Parkway and 26th Street.

=== In Singapore ===

On 16 November 1998, a scramble crossing was installed at the intersection of Robinson Road and Boon Tat Street, with its aim to reduce the waiting time for pedestrians crossing over to Lau Pa Sat. During the initial week of the launch, there was confusion between motorists and pedestrians, despite traffic police officers present at the location. The Land Transport Authority&#x27;s then-manager for traffic management Lew Yii Der said that scramble crossings were &quot;suitable only for small junctions that have a heavy pedestrian volume and where traffic flow is not so heavy&quot;. Till today, it is the only scramble crossing that exists in Singapore.

In December 2006, a six-month trial of a scramble crossing took place at the junction of Orchard Road and Bideford Road, with an aim to &quot;test the potential of a scramble crossing with light projections becoming a feature of Orchard Road&quot;. However, the project was dropped as Singapore Tourism Board deemed it unsuccessful in achieving the objective of &quot;generating buzz and interest&quot;.

Between December 2017 and January 2018, another trial of a scramble crossing was conducted, this time at the junction of Orchard Road and Cairnhill Road. The crossing drew mixed reactions from the public, with some praising the crossing as time-saving for pedestrians, whilst others criticizing it for causing confusion among pedestrians and motorists. The trial eventually concluded on 28 January 2018, but no official statements, articles or reports were published following its conclusion.

=== In Sweden ===
In October 2020, the first diagonal crossing in Stockholm was opened at the intersection of Mäster Samuelsgatan and Regeringsgatan.

=== In Taiwan ===

In Taiwan, the word &quot;pedestrian scramble&quot; was translated to (&quot;xíngrén zhuānyòng shíxiāng&quot;) in Mandarin Chinese by the transportation authority.

In the 1990s, the first pedestrian scramble was implemented at the Qingdao West Road and Gongyuan Road intersection in Zhongzheng District of Taipei by the Taipei City Government. Subsequently, more cities have applied pedestrian scrambles to important intersections and downtown areas in Taiwan, including in New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Keelung, Hsinchu, Chiayi City, and Yilan County.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
The first formal diagonal crossing in the UK was opened in Balham town centre in 2005. The success of the Balham crossing was followed by conversion of the existing crossing facilities at Oxford Circus in 2009. Further diagonal crossings were constructed in Wood Green in 2010 and Wimbledon in 2012. Swansea opened a diagonal crossing in 2015.

===In the United States===
Kansas City was one of the first cities that used a pedestrian scramble system at a few locations. Denver formerly used the pedestrian scramble system at nearly every intersection in the downtown business district. The practice was eliminated in 2011, in order to &quot;balance&quot; resources allotted to pedestrians, vehicles, and mass transit. Exclusive pedestrian intervals were kept, but the diagonal crossing was made illegal.

In Boston, most signalized intersections use an exclusive pedestrian phase, where vehicular traffic is stopped in all directions and it is possible for fast walkers to cross the street diagonally (even though the crosswalks are not marked as such). However, a growing number of traffic signals are being programmed to use a concurrent pedestrian phase. A similar situation exists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where intersections with exclusive intervals can allow fast walkers to cross the street diagonally.

In Washington, D.C., diagonal crossing existed at several downtown intersections until the mid-1980s. It was tried again on an experimental basis at 7th and H streets Northwest in the Chinatown neighborhood beginning May 2010. In 2017, a second Barnes Dance crosswalk was added at Irving and 14th streets Northwest.

In New Haven, all of the intersections with traffic lights have implemented the pedestrian scramble, since at least 1974.

In New York City, there were 635 intersections with exclusive pedestrian phases , although the majority were &quot;T-away&quot; intersections (T-intersections where the cross street takes traffic away from the intersection) and mid-block crossings, where a pedestrian scramble was one of the two phases. Many of the remaining 86 intersections with pedestrian scrambles are located where intersection geometry is skewed, requiring diagonal crossings from pedestrians and/or an exclusive pedestrian phase due to conflicts with vehicular traffic. Major pedestrian scrambles include the intersection of Vesey Street, Broadway, Park Row, and Ann Street in Lower Manhattan, as well as at Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn.

Signals at several intersections in Pittsburgh, including along Craig Street at Centre Avenue, Bayard Street, Fifth Avenue, and Forbes Avenue near the University of Pittsburgh; on Forbes at Morewood Avenue at the main entrance to Carnegie Mellon University; and on Forbes at Murray and Shady Avenues in Squirrel Hill stop traffic from all directions and allow pedestrians to cross in all directions. They are not, however, specially signed; they use a standard pedestrian crossing light (with added audio signal for the visually impaired).

The signal at the intersection of McKinley and Riverside Avenues on the campus of Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, is called the &quot;Scramble Light&quot; and is identified by the university as a campus landmark.

Athens, Ohio, has two diagonal crosswalks still in place (as of May 2022) at the intersection of Court and Union Streets in Uptown, near the Ohio University campus and at the intersection of Court and President Streets within the campus.

Some pedestrian scrambles are implemented only temporarily, during times when extremely high pedestrian traffic is expected. A notable example of that occurs on home-game Saturdays at the intersection of Main Street and Stadium Boulevard in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is immediately adjacent to Michigan Stadium. Local police take control of the vehicular signals and indicate the pedestrian phase by playing Michigan&#x27;s fight song, &quot;The Victors.&quot;

The city of Honolulu on the island of Oahu in the state of Hawaii has installed multiple pedestrian scramble crossings in the Waikīkī neighborhood. There are at least three of these intersections along Kalakaua Avenue at Lewers St, Royal Hawaiian Avenue and Seaside Avenue.

On 31 May 2013, Chicago began testing a pedestrian scramble on the intersection of State Street and Jackson Boulevard. It is now permanent.

In Nevada, both Reno and Sparks have pedestrian scramble interchanges. Reno&#x27;s is at the intersection of Virginia and 2nd Streets downtown to accommodate casino pedestrian traffic, and Sparks&#x27; are along Victorian Avenue to assist people in crossing to festivals that are held along that street.

Seattle uses the pedestrian scramble at 1st and Pike, 1st and University, 1st and Cherry, Beacon and 15th, 15th Ave NE and NE 40th St, and at the West Seattle Junction. The intersections are marked with a sign labeled &quot;All Way Walk.&quot; Bellevue, Washington has one at 108th Avenue NE and the NE 6th Street pedestrian walkway, on the west side of Bellevue Transit Center. It is not signed as an all-way walk, but has pedestrian walk lights, and is accompanied by an auditory alert of &quot;Walk sign is on for all crossings.&quot;

In California, San Francisco has several pedestrian scrambles along Stockton Street in Chinatown, Montgomery Street in the Financial District, as well as in several other locations. In Los Angeles County pedestrian scrambles are used in the Rodeo Drive commercial area of Beverly Hills; at the intersection of Westwood Boulevard and Le Conte Avenue as well as Weyburn and Broxton Avenues in the Westwood section of Los Angeles immediately adjacent to the UCLA campus; at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in Hollywood, and at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue near the University of Southern California. In the city of Santa Monica, 12 scramble crosswalks have been established in May 2016. In 1994, two scrambles were installed in Pasadena, Los Angeles County along Colorado Boulevard at two intersections: at DeLacey Avenue and at Raymond Avenue. In San Diego, one of the locations that uses pedestrian scrambles is at the intersection of Market Street and 5th Avenue, but the city does not plan to add any additional scrambles. Carlsbad added its first scramble in 2012, and the campus of UC Davis installed a bike/pedestrian scramble near its recreation center in 2014.

The City of El Paso, Texas, added pedestrian scramble markings to the intersection of Santa Fe Street and Main Drive in Downtown in April 2015. In San Antonio, there is also a pedestrian scramble at the intersection of Flores and Dolorosa Streets, which is just close to the city hall.

In Portland, Oregon, a pedestrian scramble was added in November 2015 to the intersection of NW 11th Avenue and NW Couch Street, near Powell&#x27;s Books.

Multiple pedestrian scrambles were added in the downtown area of Broadway in Nashville in March 2016.

In 2019, a pedestrian scramble was added in the downtown area of Prescott, Arizona known as Whiskey Row.

A pedestrian scramble was opened at the intersection of 8th St and Brickell Ave in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami in 2022 

In 2023, the Tempe, Arizona city government tested a pedestrian scramble at the intersection of Mill Avenue and 5th Street, near the main campus of Arizona State University. The scramble was later made permanent.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Research at Transport for London has suggested the installation of a diagonal crossing can reduce pedestrian casualties by 38%.

Since it stops all motor vehicles rather than allowing partial vehicle movements to coexist with partial pedestrian movements, the pedestrian scramble has sometimes been seen as inefficient by traffic engineers, with its removal believed to yield big savings in delays and congestion. It benefits drivers by eliminating concurrent pedestrian phases, allowing car traffic to make left or right turns without being blocked by pedestrians in the crossing. However, this also results in either longer wait times for both drivers and pedestrians, or shorter traffic-signal phases where less traffic could flow through an intersection in a single cycle.

Proper use requires that both drivers and pedestrians be aware of the traffic rules at such intersections. In some countries, that has led to a removal of at least individual installations. However, critics have dismissed these moves as further subordinating pedestrians to cars and consider the shared turns of motor vehicles and pedestrians as unnecessarily intimidating.

The pedestrian scramble may be used where large numbers of pedestrians are expected, and they will also have enough space to gather on the sidewalks in larger numbers. Under certain circumstances, pedestrian scrambles could reduce safety, as the average waiting times for pedestrians and car drivers are increased, thus creating more likelihood of people disobeying the signals.

<doc id="1156918" wikidata="Q2631966" url="?curid=1156918" title="Beli ap Rhun">
<text>Beli ap Rhun (c. 517 – c. 599) was King of Gwynedd (reigned c. 586 – c. 599). Nothing is known of the person, and his name is known only from Welsh genealogies, which confirm that he had at least two sons. He succeeded his father Rhun Hir ap Maelgwn as king, and was in turn succeeded by his son Iago. Beli was either the father or grandfather of Saint Edeyrn.

The royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies, Jesus College MS. 20, and &quot;Hengwrt MS. 202&quot; show him as the ancestor and descendant of kings, and thus presumably a king himself. The &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot; () says that he is the ancestor of Saint Edeyrn (the &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot; says that he was the son of Nudd or Lludd who was the son of Beli, while &quot;Hengwrt MS. 202&quot; says that he was the son of Beli).

One of the medieval &quot;Welsh Triads&quot; mentions a certain &quot;Rhun ap Beli&quot;, implying that there was yet another son of Beli, who was famed for his military exploits. The name is repeated elsewhere in medieval poetry, such as in Hywel Foel&#x27;s (fl. c. 1240 – 1300) &quot;awdl&quot; lamenting the capture and imprisonment of Owain ap Gruffudd, where he likens Owain to Rhun: &quot;Who if free, like Rhun the son of Beli, Would not let Lloegria burn his borders&quot;. There is no confirming evidence that such a person existed, and it is contradicted by records such as the royal genealogies. Scholars such as Thomas Stephens have concluded that this is a mistake, and that the intended person was someone else.

<doc id="1156923" wikidata="Q1551763" url="?curid=1156923" title="People's Commissariat">
<text>A People&#x27;s Commissariat (; Narkomat) was a structure in the Soviet state (in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in other union and autonomous republics, in the Soviet Union) from 1917–1946 which functioned as the central executive body in charge of managing a particular field of state activity or a separate sector of the national economy; analogue of the ministry. As a rule, a People&#x27;s Commissariat was headed by a People&#x27;s Commissar (; Narkom), which is part of the government – the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the appropriate level.

Commissariats were created as central organs of state administration when Soviet power was established in the republics in the territory of the former Russian Empire.

The number of People&#x27;s Commissariats changed in accordance with the requirements of the current moment; overall it increased due to the separation of existing ones and the formation of new ones.

==First People&#x27;s Commissariats==
The first People&#x27;s Commissariats were created by the &quot;Decree on the establishment of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars&quot;, adopted by the 2nd Congress of Soviets on November 9, 1917. The decree was established: 

The All-Russian Congress of Soviets and its executive body, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, had the right to control the activities of the People&#x27;s Commissars and to remove them.

By the same decree the first composition of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars was formed, including the list of People&#x27;s Commissariats:
*People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Agriculture;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Labor;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Trade and Industry;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Finance;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Justice;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Food;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of National Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Railway Affairs.

Later, by a decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of December 15, 1917, the Supreme Council of National Economy under the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, which had the status of People&#x27;s Commissariat, was established to organize and manage the national economy.

When Soviet power was established in other Soviet republics, similar commissariats were established on the territory of the former Russian Empire.

The Council of People&#x27;s Commissars adopted on December 1, 1917, at the suggestion of Lenin, the decree &quot;On the amount of remuneration of the people&#x27;s commissars and senior officials&quot; (published on December 6, 1917, in No. 16 of the &quot;Newspapers of the Provisional Worker and Peasant Government&quot;). According to the decree, the remuneration of the people&#x27;s commissars was 500 rubles plus 100 rubles for each disabled family member, which was approximately equal to the average wage of the worker.

==People&#x27;s Commissariats of the Soviet Republics==
===Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic===
With minor changes and additions, the same list of people&#x27;s commissariats of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is also presented in Article 43 of the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of 1918 adopted by the 5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets.

====Autonomous Republics====
Article 11 of the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic of 1918 provided for the opportunity for &quot;regions differing in special life and national composition&quot; to create autonomous regions with the formation of their regional Congresses of Soviets and their executive bodies, that is, the Councils of People&#x27;s Commissars. Thus, in the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic, formed in 1926 as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in 1929 the Constitution was adopted, which reads:

===Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic===

The Constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, adopted in 1919, in article 14 established:

However, no list of People&#x27;s Commissariats was provided in the Constitution.

===Relation with the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Soviet Union===
Since the formation of the Soviet Union, the Union republics delegated part of their sovereign powers to the newly formed state, only a part of governance issues remained in their jurisdiction. The Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet Union (Article 18) defines the list of People&#x27;s Commissariats, whose leaders were members of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Republics:
*Supreme Council of National Economy;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Agriculture;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Food;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Finance;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Labor;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Justice;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Inspection;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Health;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Social Security;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of National Affairs.

The Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Republic with a deliberative vote also included representatives representing those People&#x27;s Commissariats, whose leadership began to fall within the competence of the Soviet Union:
*People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Foreign Trade;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Communications;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs.

==People&#x27;s Commissariats of the Soviet Union==
The creation of the Soviet Union was legally formalized by the Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet Union, which provided for the formation of the government of the union state. It was called the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Soviet Union; it included the chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Soviet Union, his deputies, the leaders of the People&#x27;s Commissariats of the Soviet Union.

The Treaty (Article 11) provides the following list of People&#x27;s Commissariats of the Soviet Union:
*People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Foreign Trade;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Communications;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Inspection;
*Supreme Council of National Economy;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Labor;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Food;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Finance.

As the national economy developed and strengthened, the number of People&#x27;s Commissariats at all levels increased. So, in 1932, the Supreme Council of the National Economy of the Soviet Union was transformed into three people&#x27;s commissariat:
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Heavy Industry;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of Light Industry;
*People&#x27;s Commissariat of the Forest Industry.

Further, from 1936 to 1939, the number of People&#x27;s Commissariats increased to 24. For example, in 1939, the People&#x27;s Commissariats of Fish Industry and Meat and Dairy Industry were divided off from the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Food Industry USSR.

==Transformation into ministries==
In 1946, the People&#x27;s Commissariats of all levels were transformed into ministries of the same name.

<doc id="1156924" wikidata="Q437246" url="?curid=1156924" title="East Gondwana">
<text>The South Polar region of the Cretaceous comprised the continent of East Gondwana–modern day Australia, Zealandia, and Antarctica–a product of the break-up of Gondwana in the Cretaceous Period. The southern region, during this time, was much warmer than it is today, ranging from perhaps in the latest Cretaceous Maastrichtian in what is now southeastern Australia. This prevented permanent ice sheets from developing and fostered polar forests, which were largely dominated by conifers, cycads, and ferns, and relied on a temperate climate and heavy rainfall. Major fossil-bearing geological formations that record this area are: the Santa Marta and Sobral Formations of Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula; the Snow Hill Island, Lopez de Bertodano, and the Hidden Lake Formations on James Ross Island also off the Antarctic Peninsula; and the Eumeralla and Wonthaggi Formations in Australia.

The South Polar region housed many endemic species, including several relict forms that had gone extinct elsewhere by the Cretaceous. Of the dinosaur assemblage, the most diverse were the small hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs. The South Polar region also was home to the last labyrinthodont amphibian, &quot;Koolasuchus&quot;. The isolation of Antarctica produced a distinct ecosystem of marine life called the Weddellian Province.

== Landscape ==
=== Geology ===

The Latady Basin in the southern Antarctic Peninsula–Palmer Land–contains volcanic rock, evidencing a large magmatic event in the Middle Cretaceous referred to as the Palmer Land event. This area has yielded an array of both macro- and micro- plant and mollusk fossils representative of the Early Cretaceous, as well as the Middle to Late Jurassic. The area that is now the Antarctic Peninsula, throughout the Mesozoic, was subducting the proto-Pacific plate, causing volcanic activity.

An important fossil-bearing formation is the Santa Marta Formation at James Ross Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most significant formations of the Southern Hemisphere, representing a high diversity terrestrial flora and fauna of the Late Cretaceous polar region. Seymour Island is similar in this respect, the area of discovery for vertebrate and invertebrate creatures–such as plesiosaurs–of the Late Cretaceous, extending into the Eocene. Other Cretaceous fossil-bearing formations in Antarctica are the Snow Hill Island Formation, the Lopez de Bertodano Formation, and the Hidden Lake Formation, also on James Ross Island.

The Eumeralla Formation of Dinosaur Cove and the Wonthaggi Formation in Victoria, Australia, contain a number of dinosaur fossils and tracks from the Early Cretaceous. The Tahora Formation represents the reptile assemblage of Cretaceous New Zealand.
The Eromanga Sea was an inland sea across what would be Australia that formed in the Early Cretaceous. The sea reached the Eromanga Basin from the north via the Carpentarian Basin. The southern end of the sea comprised lagoons and rivers, and to the east in Surat Basin a bay. When India drifted away from Australia in the Early Cretaceous, the Perth Basin also filled with seawater. The area that would be the Coral Sea was a rift valley. As Australia and Antarctica drifted apart throughout the Cretaceous, a sea formed in between them.

=== Vegetation ===

The Cretaceous is characterized by warm global temperatures caused by the high amounts of carbon dioxide and possibly methane greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This caused a lack of permanent ice coverage in the polar regions, though the carbon dioxide level dropped between 115 and 66 million years ago (mya), possibly allowing some permanent ice cover. It is possible that, throughout the Cretaceous, several small ice sheets developed. Increased tectonic activity, causing more geothermal heat, may have prevented glaciation and increased global temperatures. Temperatures may have been up to 15 °C (27 °F) warmer than they are in the modern age.

====Jurassic====
The landscape of the Middle Jurassic polar region has been reconstructed from the remains of forests exposed in New Zealand, which were between 70 and 80°S during the Jurassic. The vegetation was largely made up of conifers, cycads, and other gymnosperms, as well as ferns; on the forest floor grew lycopods, bryophytes, fungi, and algae. It had a temperate climate with heavy rainfall.

====Early Cretaceous====
In the Early Cretaceous, East Gondwana (Australia, Antarctica and Zealandia) had started to split away from South America, and India and Madagascar also began to separate at around the same time. The tropical zone may have extended, during the Cretaceous, to 32°S, allowing year-round tree growth in the Antarctic in polar forests. The discovery of several mature evergreen and deciduous trees indicate a warm-to-cool temperature with moderate seasons lacking widespread freezing, at least between the latitudes 70 and 85°S. However, it is also possible that the plant life may only be representative of the warm summer months. Much of what is known of the plant life of East Gondwana during the Cretaceous consists of pollen remains and leaf compressions from the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Depending on the latitude, the polar winters may have lasted from six weeks to four and a half months.
However, rocks from the Early Cretaceous Wonthaggi Formation in southeastern Australia evidence seasonally frozen ground. Its geographical positioning in the Early Cretaceous at around 78°S indicates this area experienced one to three months of darkness in winters, and this area is representative of a glacial-fed floodplain. Evidence of Early Cretaceous glaciation and cold climates was discovered in sediments in the Eromanga Basin in modern-day central Australia, or 60 to 80°S in the Early Cretaceous. This basin was a large inland sea in the Cretaceous. Nonetheless, similar formations could have been created by simply debris flow, and so it is possible that glaciation did not ever occur there. The total polar ice coverage during the Mesozoic may have been a third of the size as it is in modern times, though cold snaps of subfreezing temperatures possibly occurred throughout the Early Cretaceous.

====Late Cretaceous====
The canopy of the polar forests around present-day Alexander Island, which was around 75°S in the Middle Cretaceous, were predominantly evergreen, and likely most South Polar forests were as well, and comprised mainly araucarian and podocarp conifers. It is thought that these trees remained dormant throughout the polar winters until summers under the midnight sun.

Evidence of flowering plants dating to around 80 Ma in the Late Cretaceous suggests the existence of temperate forests–similar to those in present-day Australia, New Zealand, and southern South America. Some flower remains were discovered near 60°S, and it is possible at such a low latitude that this area was subject to polar winters and seasonal weather, though the flowers suggest an annual temperature range of and a rainy climate.

Pollen remains from southeastern Australia are identical to living plant species of Australia: conifers, flowering plants that inhabit areas with high rainfall and a Mediterranean climate, and sclerophyllous scrublands, indicating a unique landscape of rainforest and open bushland. Indicated by the size of the tree rings on fossil trees, the Antarctic polar forests featured a cooling trend throughout the Maastrichtian age 72 to 66 mya, from a mean annual temperature of to a more seasonally extreme . These plants likely survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which killed off most life 66 Ma, on the volcanic Antarctic Peninsula; plant fossils dating to 60 Ma in the Paleocene from Seymour Island off this peninsula are recognized as being the ancestors of temperate plants inhabiting modern-day Australia and South America.

The Late Cretaceous (Campanian) Zamek and Half Three Point Formations of King George Island were located at 60°S and display a rich assemblage of fossil flora, such as &quot;Podocarpus&quot;; &quot;Araucaria&quot;; the leptosporangiate ferns &quot;Cladophlebis&quot; and &quot;Clavifera&quot;; and a variety of Magnoliopsida flowering plants, &quot;Dicotylophyllum&quot;, &quot;Myrciophyllum santacruzensis&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, &quot;Sterculiaephyllum australis&quot;, &quot;Monimiophyllum&quot;, and so forth. The Sobral Formation of Seymour Island spanning the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary at a paleolatitude of 63°S provided a new genus of fossil flower in the family Cunoniaceae, &quot;Eucryphiaceoxylon eucryphioides&quot;.

== Ecology ==

Much as in Australia today, East Gondwana played host to many endemic animals, which included many relict species of families that had gone extinct in the rest of the Cretaceous world. It is possible the polar regions of the Late Cretaceous had been inhabited by groups of plants and animals whose ancestry can be traced back to the Ordovician. The gradual isolation of Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous created a distinct group of aquatic creatures called the Weddellian Province.

=== Dinosaurs ===
==== Birds ====

The remains of the ancestor of modern birds, the Neornithes, are uncommon in the Mesozoic, with a large radiation occurring in the Neogene of Antarctica. However, the discovery of the Late Cretaceous &quot;Vegavis&quot;, a goose-like bird, on Vega Island indicates that the major modern bird groups were already common in the Cretaceous. A femur belonging to an unidentified seriema-like bird was also discovered on Vega Island. Bird footprints were preserved in Dinosaur Cove, and, being larger than most Cretaceous bird species, indicate an abundance of larger enantiornithe or ornithurine birds during the Early Cretaceous.

Two diving birds, possible primitive divers, were discovered in Late Cretaceous Chile and Antarctica: &quot;Neogaeornis&quot; and &quot;Polarornis&quot;. &quot;Polarornis&quot; may have been capable of both diving and flight. The earliest penguins, &quot;Crossvallia&quot; and &quot;Waimanu&quot;, are known from 61–62 Ma in the Paleocene, however molecular data suggests penguins first evolved in the Late Cretaceous. Given that these penguins were dated so close to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, the group either evolved before the event or very rapidly afterwards.

==== Non-avian ====

Dinosaur fossils are rare from the South Polar region, and major fossil-bearing locations are the James Ross Island group; Beardmore glacier in Antarctica; Roma, Queensland; Mangahouanga stream in New Zealand; and Dinosaur Cove in Victoria, Australia. The dinosaur remains of this region, such as those found in Victoria, consist only fragmentary pieces, making identification controversial. For example, disputed identifications of an allosaurid which may represent an abelisaurid, the ceratopsian &quot;Serendipaceratops&quot; which could be an ankylosaur, and the difficult-to-classify theropod &quot;Timimus&quot; have consequently been made.

The supercontinent Pangaea of the Jurassic allowed major dinosaur clades to achieve a global distribution before breaking up, and several closely related cognates existed between South Polar forms and forms found elsewhere despite separation by the Tethys Ocean. However, dinosaur groups that achieved pan-Gondwanan distribution over the course of the Cretaceous would have had to have used the land bridge connecting Australia to South America via Antarctica in the South Polar region. The South Polar iguanodontian &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot; is most closely related to European rhabdodontids, which were the dominant group in Europe during the Late Cretaceous. The Cretaceous South Polar &quot;Kunbarrasaurus&quot; is identified as being part of a unique lineage of Gondwanan ankylosaurs, which suggests homogeneity in the Gondwanan fauna. The Dromaeosauridae are known from Antarctica, and represent a relict population from a previously world-wide distribution. Despite these apparent cross-continental migrations, it is unlikely that South Polar dinosaurs migrated out of the polar forests during the winter, as they were either too massive–such as ankylosaurs–or too small–such as troodontids–to travel long distances, and a large sea between East Gondwana and other continents impeded any such migrations in the Late Cretaceous. It is possible, to cope with the winter conditions, some dinosaurs hibernated, such as the theropod &quot;Timimus&quot;.
The most common and diverse group found so far are the hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs, making up half of the dinosaur taxa found in southeastern Australia, which is unseen in more tropical regions, perhaps indicating some kind of advantage over other dinosaurs in the poles. Being small with grinding dentition, they likely fed on low-lying vegetation such as lycopods and podocarp seed pods. The hypsilophodont-like &quot;Leaellynasaura&quot; had large eye sockets, larger than more tropical hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs, and may have had acute night vision, suggesting that &quot;Leaellynasaura&quot;, and perhaps other hypsilophodont-like dinosaurs, lived in the polar areas for year-round or most of the year, including polar winters. Bonegrowth was continuous throughout its life, indicating it did not hibernate, being possible by perhaps being endothermic or poikilothermic, or by digging burrows. However, it is possible that the large eyes are merely due to ontogenesis, that is, relatively large eye-sockets may have been a feature only seen in juveniles or perhaps was a birth-defect, since there is only one specimen known.

Though remains are scant and, consequently, taxonomic descriptions can be dubious, the Victorian theropod remains have been assigned to seven different clades: Ceratosauria, Megaraptora, Tyrannosauroidea, and Maniraptora. However, tyrannosauroids are not known from other Gondwanan continents, and are more known from northern Laurasia. Unlike the other Gondwanan continents whose apex predators where abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids, the discovery of &quot;Australovenator&quot;, &quot;Rapator&quot; and an unnamed species in Australia suggests the megaraptorans were the top predators of East Gondwana. The tail vertebrae of an unknown theropod, dubbed &quot;Joan Wiffen&#x27;s theropod&quot;, were discovered in the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous rocks of New Zealand.
Four titanosaurs–&quot;Australotitan, Savannasaurus&quot;, &quot;Diamantinasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Wintonotitan&quot;–discovered in the Winton Formation make up the sauropod assemblage of Cretaceous Australia, though, these creatures probably avoided the polar regions as their remains are completely absent in Southeast Australia which was within the South Polar region in the Cretaceous. However, it is likely that at least the titanosaurs migrated to Australia from South America, which would have required them to pass through Antarctica, since titanosaurs evolved in the Cretaceous after the break-up of Pangaea. It is possible the Bonarelli Event in the Middle Cretaceous may have made Antarctica warmer and therefore more hospitable to sauropods. These dinosaurs probably fed on the fleshy seeds of podocarp and yew trees, as well as the commonplace forked ferns of the time.

==== Paleocene ====

After an asteroid impact, the ensuing impact winter is thought to have killed off the dinosaurs along with much of Mesozoic life in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. However, the lack of an abrupt extinction horizon in Antarctic or Australian sediments for plant and bivalve fossils during this time period indicates a less powerful impact in the South Polar region. Given that the dinosaurs and other fauna of the polar regions of the Cretaceous were well adapted for living in long periods of dark and cold weather, it has been postulated that this community might have survived the event.

=== Rivers and lakes ===
The last temnospondyls–a group of giant amphibians which mainly died out after the Triassic–inhabited the South Polar region into the Early Cretaceous. &quot;Koolasuchus&quot;, perhaps the last of the temnospondyls, is thought to have survived in regions where it was too cold for their competitors, the neosuchians–a group of reptiles containing modern crocodilians–which are inactive in water below , to survive. Though neosuchians are known from Cretaceous Australia, it is thought that they stayed away from the polar region, arriving to Australia over-seas rather than over-land.
It is likely the temnospondyls inhabited the freshwater systems of polar Australia until the Bonarelli Event in the Middle Cretaceous around 100 mya increased temperatures and allowed neosuchians to inhabit Antarctica. These neosuchians, at an adult size of no more than in length, likely led to the extinction of the temnospondyls in tandem with more-developed ray-finned fish which perhaps targeted their larvae. The migration of neosuchians into the region suggests that average winter temperatures were greater than , with an average annual temperature of more than . However, polar neosuchians are only known from an almost complete skeleton of &quot;Isisfordia&quot;, and other neosuchian remains are of undetermined species.

Plesiosaurs inhabited freshwater river and estuary systems, given the locations of their remains, probably colonizing Australia in the Early to Middle Jurassic. Their remains, mainly teeth, have been documented from southeastern Australia deriving from the Late Cretaceous, though they were never described as the remains are too sparse to do so. The teeth share some affinity with pliosaurs, notably the rhomaleosaurids and &quot;Leptocleidus&quot;, which died out in the Early Cretaceous, indicating the polar freshwater systems may have been a refuge for the pliosaurs of the Cretaceous. In contrast to modern marine reptiles, these South Polar plesiosaurs probably had a better tolerance of colder waters.

=== Oceans ===

Early to Middle Cretaceous marine reptile remains of South Australia include five families of plesiosaurs–Cryptoclididae, Elasmosauridae, Polycotylidae, Rhomaleosauridae, and Pliosauridae–and the ichthyosaur family Ophthalmosauridae. The discovery of several juvenile plesiosaur remains suggest they used the nutrient-rich waters of the coast as sheltered calving grounds, the cold deterring predators such as sharks. Most of the plesiosaurs discovered had a cosmopolitan distribution, however endemic forms existed there such as &quot;Opallionectes&quot; and a possible new species of cryptoclidid. A dubious species of elasmosaurid &quot;Woolungasaurus&quot;, was named in 1928, one of the earliest description of an Australian marine reptile. Several mollusc, gastropod, ammonite, bony fish, chimaerid, and squid-like belemnite remains have been recovered as well. The coastal area may have experienced winter freezing, and these reptiles, in response, may have migrated north during the winter, had a more active metabolism than tropical reptiles, have hibernated in freshwater areas much like the modern day American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;), or have been endothermic similar to modern day leatherback sea turtles (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;). The lower number of plesiosaurs and higher number of ichthyosaurs and sea turtles in more northerly areas of Australia indicates a preference for colder areas in plesiosaurs.
Several Late Cretaceous oceanic plesiosaurs and mosasaurs have been discovered in New Zealand and Antarctica, with some, such as &quot;Mauisaurus&quot;, being endemic, while others, such as &quot;Prognathodon&quot;, having a cosmopolitan distribution. Elasmosaurs and pliosaurs are known from one to three species from this area. The discovery of three cryptoclidids in the Southern Hemisphere–&quot;Morturneria&quot; from Antarctica, &quot;Aristonectes&quot; from South America, and &quot;Kaiwhekea&quot; from New Zealand–indicates a diversification of the family in the Late Cretaceous of this region and perhaps an increasing productivity of the early Southern Ocean.

=== Pterosaurs ===

Two clades of pterosaurs are represented in Early Cretaceous Australia, Pteranodontoidea and Ctenochasmatoidea, remains mainly deriving from the Toolebuc Formation and areas of Queensland and New South Wales. It is thought that at least six pterosaur taxa existed in Cretaceous Australia, however, given the fragmentary nature of the remains, many fossils recovered originate from undetermined pterosaur. Fossils were found in shallow-water environments and lagoons, indicating a diet of fish and other aquatic life. The ctenochasmatids were the only archaeopterodactyloids to survive into the Cretaceous. The only pterosaur tooth remains discovered in Australia deriving from the Early Cretaceous belong to &quot;Mythunga&quot; and a possible Late Cretaceous anhanguerid. &quot;Mythunga&quot; is estimated to have had a wingspan, much larger than any other archaeopterodactyloid discovered, though it is possible the pterosaur is more related to the Anhangueridae or Ornithocheiridae. However, pterosaur remains existing in what were the non-polar regions of Australia, given their ability to migrate by air, perhaps did not need to cross a land bridge through the polar regions to arrive there, meaning they did not ever inhabit the South Polar region.

Of the Late Cretaceous pterosaurs, only the remains belonging to the family Azhdarchidae–found in the Carnarvon and Perth basins in Western Australia–were assigned to a taxon. A possible representative of Ornithocheiridae was found in Late Cretaceous Western Australia, though the family was previously thought to have gone extinct in the Early Cretaceous.

=== Mammals ===

Seven mammals have been discovered from Early Cretaceous Australia: an undescribed ornithorhynchid, &quot;Kryoryctes&quot;, &quot;Kollikodon&quot;, &quot;Ausktribosphenos&quot;, &quot;Bishops&quot;, &quot;Steropodon&quot;, and &quot;Corriebaatar&quot;; all of which were endemic to Australia during this time. It is likely mammals crossed the Antarctic land bridge between Australia and South America in the Early Cretaceous, and likely the ancestors of the endemic mammals of Australia arrived during the Jurassic across the supercontinent Pangaea.

=== Invertebrates ===
Several fossils of insects and crustaceans are known from South Polar Cretaceous sediments of New Zealand. The Late Cretaceous Mangaotanean Monro Conglomerate was situated at 68°S and provided fossils of &quot;Helastia sp.&quot;, and the crab &quot;Hemioon novozelandicum&quot; was found in the Swale Siltstone, located at 76°S during the late Albian. Several specimens of insects were also found in the Tupuangi Formation of the Chatham Islands at a latitude of 79°S during the Cenomanian to Turonian.

<text>Ammonium carbonate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is an ammonium salt of carbonic acid. It is composed of ammonium cations and carbonate anions . Since ammonium carbonate readily degrades to gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide upon heating, it is used as a leavening agent and also as smelling salt. It is also known as baker&#x27;s ammonia and is a predecessor to the more modern leavening agents baking soda and baking powder. It is a component of what was formerly known as sal volatile and salt of [[hartshorn]], and produces a pungent smell when baked. It comes in the form of a white powder or block, with a molar mass of 96.09 g/mol and a density of 1.50 g/cm3. It is a strong electrolyte.

==Production==
Ammonium carbonate is produced by combining carbon dioxide and aqueous ammonia. About 80,000 tons/year were produced as of 1997. 

An orthorhombic ammonium carbonate monohydrate is known (). It crystallizes in an ammonia solution exposed in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere.

===Decomposition===
Ammonium carbonate slowly decomposes at standard temperature and pressure through two pathways. Thus any initially pure sample of ammonium carbonate will soon become a mixture including various byproducts.

Ammonium carbonate can spontaneously decompose into ammonium bicarbonate and ammonia:

Which further decomposes to carbon dioxide, water and another molecule of ammonia:

== Uses ==

===Leavening agent===
Ammonium carbonate may be used as a leavening agent in traditional recipes, particularly those from northern Europe and Scandinavia (e.g. Amerikaner, Speculoos, Tunnbröd or Lebkuchen). It was the precursor to today&#x27;s more commonly used baking powder.

Originally made from ground deer horn and called hartshorn, today it is called baker&#x27;s ammonia. It is prepared by the sublimation of a mixture of ammonium sulfate and calcium carbonate and occurs as a white powder or a hard, white or translucent mass. It acts as a heat activated leavening agent and breaks down into carbon dioxide (leavening), ammonia (which needs to dissipate) and water. It is sometimes combined with sodium bicarbonate double acting baking powder and to help mask any ammonia smell not baked out.

It also serves as an acidity regulator and has the E number E503. It can be replaced with baking powder, but this may affect both the taste and texture of the finished product. Baker&#x27;s ammonia should be used to create thin dry baked goods like crackers and cookies. This allows the strong ammonia smell to bake out. It should not be used to make moist baked items like cake since ammonia is hydrophilic and will leave a strong bitter taste.

Its use as a leavening agent, with associated controversy, goes back centuries:
===Other uses===
Ammonium carbonate is the main component of smelling salts, although the commercial scale of their production is small. Buckley&#x27;s cough syrup from Canada today uses ammonium carbonate as an active ingredient intended to help relieve symptoms of bronchitis. It is also used as an emetic. It is also found in smokeless tobacco products, such as Skoal, and it is used in aqueous solution as a photographic lens cleaning agent, such as Eastman Kodak&#x27;s &quot;Kodak Lens Cleaner.&quot;

It is also used for luring of apple maggots in Washington State, to monitor the spread of the infestation and adjust the borders of the Apple Maggot Quarantine Area.

<doc id="1156943" wikidata="Q2334273" url="?curid=1156943" title="Silver Lining (Bonnie Raitt album)">
<text>Silver Lining is the fourteenth studio album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 2002 on Capitol Records.
The album peaked at No. 13 on the US Billboard 200
Silver Lining has also been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Silver Lining&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74 based on 11 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. 

Edna Gundersen of USA Today wrote, &quot;Silver Lining, produced by Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake, showcases Raitt&#x27;s knack for pop elegance in such tunes as the title track (by David Gray) and aching ballad Wounded Heart. But it also proves Raitt isn&#x27;t afraid to get a little Delta mud under her fingernails in pursuit of pure funk and earthy grooves. Less polished than recent efforts, the album has a loose, raucous party vibe that never resorts to sloppy shortcuts. Slabs of boogie, gospelized R&amp;B and raw blues recall the organic might of the Meters and Little Feat yet crackle with freshness and vitality.&quot;
Jason MacNeil of PopMatters proclaimed &quot;While it doesn’t contain the radio friendly tracks of past classics like “Thing Called Love” or “Something To Talk About”, the album as a whole is definitely one of her strongest to date.“

Natalie Nichols of Los Angeles Times claimed &quot;Raitt continues to explore common threads in music across cultures with her 16th album. Yet &quot;Silver Lining&quot; is no academic exercise, but a varied collection incorporating her trademark Delta-influenced blues-rock, African styles, New Orleans boogie and modern adult-pop elements.&quot;

What&#x27;s more two songs from Silver Lining, Gnawin&#x27; On It and Time of Our Lives, earned Grammy nominations in the category of Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.

== Singles ==
Singles &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help You Now&quot; peaked at No. 15 and &quot;Silver Lining&quot; got to No. 21 on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary Songs chart. Another song from the album, called &quot;Time of Our Lives&quot;, also got to No. 27 on that said chart.

<text>.li is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Liechtenstein. The .li TLD was created in 1993. The domain is sponsored and administered by the University of Liechtenstein in Vaduz. Registration of .li domain names used to be managed by SWITCH, administrator of Switzerland&#x27;s .ch ccTLD. In February 2013, SWITCH discontinued its .li registration service for private customers, delegating it to a number of recognized partner firms.

There are no requirements to apply for the extension. Registrations of internationalized domain names have been accepted since March 2004. Domain names under 3 characters are reserved for the state and its institutions.

==Domain hacks and vanity usage==

Many Long Island organizations and companies have adopted the .li TLD as a domain hack.

As &quot;-li&quot; is a diminutive ending in Swiss German (Standard German &quot;-lein&quot;), many Swiss companies register an additional, or alternative, .li domain for their businesses and services.

In Russian, &quot;-li&quot; is a verbal ending of past tense plural form. That is why some Russian-oriented sites use it as a part of the site name with the verbal stem before the dot.

Li is also a Romanization of the second most common Chinese surname. Some people with this last name register .li domains for personal use.

<text>Seaford is a beachside suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 36 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Frankston local government area. Seaford recorded a population of 17,215 at the .

==History==

Seaford was the site of the Karrum Karrum swamp, which was utilised for food by the Bunurong Aboriginal people. In the early twentieth century, after European settlement, the swamp was drained for farming purposes (with wet areas remaining only at low lands; including Seaford and the Edithvale wetlands).

The name Seaford arose during a meeting of local residents in 1913, called to decide upon a name for the settlement and the new railway station about to open. It was agreed that the name should contain some reference to the sea. Councillor Sydney Plowman suggested &quot;Seaford&quot;, dropping the &quot;l&quot; from his home town of Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, England. The suggestion was adopted.

The Seaford Post Office opened on 6 March 1914.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the suburb grew as a result of affordability, and proximity to the beach and Frankston. In 1985 a report was produced titled &quot;Ecology and Management of Seaford Swamp&quot;, recommending the creation of lagoons, substantial tree plantations and improvement of public facilities. These initiatives were implemented by the City of Frankston and Melbourne Water, using funds from the Melbourne Parks and Waterways Grants Program.

==Sport, recreation and public facilities==

Seaford is home to several public park spaces including three with barbecue facilities and playground equipment. Seaford Scout Group, one of the earliest Australian chapters, merged with Carrum to form the Seaford Carrum Scout Group.

Seaford is home to Seaford United Soccer Club and the Seaford Football Netball Club competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League, both using the &#x27;Tigers&#x27; nickname. The suburb is also home to two cricket clubs, the Seaford Cricket Club (Est. 1924) and the Seaford Tigers Cricket Club (Est. 1990) who compete in the Mornington Peninsula Cricket Association. Southern Districts Rugby Club has its base in the north of the suburb.

In February 2011 the Australian Football League&#x27;s St Kilda Football Club officially opened its $10.25 million training venue at Belvedere Park in Seaford.

===Seaford Foreshore Reserve===

The Seaford Foreshore Reserve is one of the few remaining substantial, continuous strands of natural coastal vegetation near Melbourne. Seaford is notable for this reserve, which divides the beach from Nepean Highway along the whole length of the suburb. This reserve was the site for an extensive dune restoration program undertaken by the Port Phillip Authority in 1972, under the title of the &quot;Seaford Experimental Project&quot;. The program involved extensive areas of fencing, revegetation and the installation of walking tracks, seats, tables and shelters.

===Keast Park===

Keast Park is a public park situated at the northern end of the Seaford foreshore on Port Phillip Bay. The master plan for the park was designed in 2004, the project explored ways to protect the ecology of the sensitive foreshore environment with the functional requirements of the public park. The park serves a broad range of functions, including the Carrum Bowls Club, the sea scouts, public toilets and change facilities, a multi-purpose community space and a small café.
===Seaford Wetlands===

Seaford Wetlands is a nature reserve listed on the Register of the National Estate. The wetlands are home to a wide variety of bird life, including a number of rare and endangered migratory species protected by international agreements.

The large numbers and variety of bird life make the wetlands popular with bird watchers. Many migratory birds from as far afield as Siberia visit the reserve from October to March.

There are stands of river red gums around the margins of the Wetlands, some of which are estimated to be around 300 years old. Some have scars where the bark was stripped for use by the Bunurong Aboriginal people prior to European settlement.

The swamp is noted for its prolific and various bird life. Around 130 different species have been observed there in recent years. The more common species are wetland-dependent birds which occur in southern Victoria, such as ducks, swans, rails and pelicans.

A number of rare migratory bird species also visit the wetlands between October and March. These come from Northern Asia and are protected by treaties between the Australian Government and the Governments of Japan and China. Many birds can easily be seen from the vantage points overlooking the wetland&#x27;s lagoons. Others are more difficult to spot because they prefer the protection of the reed beds.

The wetlands support a small variety of native animals consisting of swamp rat, water rat, snakes and frogs. Three types of fish can also be found in the wetlands: common galaxias, short-finned eels and mosquitofish (an exotic pest species).

===Kananook walking trail===

A popular walking trail, split by roads, passes by the Seaford RSL, continuing in both directions.

===Kananook Creek===
Main article: Kananook Creek

Once draining part of the Carrum Carrum Swamp, the Kananook Creek runs from northern Seaford where it is fed by the Eel Race Drain and flows southwards through Seaford, roughly adjacent to the Nepean Highway through to Frankston where it flows into Port Phillip.

==Schools==

There are six primary schools in Seaford, Kananook Primary School, Belvedere Park Primary School, Seaford Primary School, Seaford North Primary School, Seaford Park Primary School and St Anne&#x27;s Catholic Primary School. And Seaford is also home to a secondary school as well, Patterson River Secondary School is located in the north of the suburb.

==Public transport==

Seaford is serviced by both Bus and Commuter rail. Two railway stations are within the suburb – Seaford and Kananook – on the Frankston railway line. Both are in Zone 2.

Sarah MacDiarmid disappeared from Kananook Station on 11 July 1990, last seen walking from the station to the carpark.

==State Politics==

Since the state election on 29 November 2014, the suburb of Seaford has been represented by Labor MP Sonya Kilkenny in Victoria&#x27;s Legislative Assembly. Seaford falls within the Electoral district of Carrum.

<doc id="1156963" wikidata="Q598538" url="?curid=1156963" title="1999 NBA draft">
<text>The [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999]] [[NBA draft]] was held on June 30, 1999, at the MCI Center (now Capital One Arena) in Washington, D.C. It was the first draft in which four players from the same college were picked in the first round, with Elton Brand (1st selection), Trajan Langdon (11th), Corey Maggette (13th) and William Avery (14th) being selected out of Duke University. It is widely viewed as one of the best draft classes, with a total of nine future NBA All-Stars being chosen, as well as three winners of the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award—Manu Ginóbili, Jason Terry, and Lamar Odom. Six of the top nine picks were NBA All-Stars. Pablo Prigioni, who was eligible for selection but went undrafted, eventually debuted in the 2012–2013 season as the oldest rookie in NBA history at age 35.

==Draft selections==


==Notable undrafted players==

These players eligible for the 1999 NBA draft were not selected but have played in the NBA.
==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
This year would see a step down in the number of overall underclassmen entering the NBA draft. After seeing 40 initial entries the last two years, this year only saw 39 total initial entries at hand.

The following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Ron Artest – F, St. John&#x27;s (sophomore)

<doc id="1156984" wikidata="Q838726" url="?curid=1156984" title="Transportation in Los Angeles">
<text>Los Angeles has a complex multimodal transportation infrastructure, which serves as a regional, national and international hub for passenger and freight traffic. The system includes the United States&#x27; largest port complex; an extensive freight and passenger rail infrastructure, including light rail lines and rapid transit lines; numerous airports and bus lines; vehicle for hire companies; and an extensive freeway and road system. People in Los Angeles rely on cars as the dominant mode of transportation, but since 1990 the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has built over of light and heavy rail serving more and more parts of Los Angeles and the greater area of Los Angeles County; Los Angeles was the last major city in the United States to get a permanent rail system installed.

==Intercity==
Transportation in Greater Los Angeles is a complex multimodal transportation infrastructure, which serves as a regional, national and international hub for passenger and freight traffic. The transportation system of Greater Los Angeles includes the United States&#x27; largest port complex, seven commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. With many highways, it is integrated into the Interstate Highway System.

===Air transportation===

The Los Angeles metropolitan area has five commercial airports and many more general-aviation airports.

The primary Los Angeles airport is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The seventh busiest commercial airport in the world and the third busiest in the United States, LAX handled 28.8 million passengers, of cargo and 380,000 aircraft movements in 2020.

Other major nearby commercial airports include: LA/Ontario International Airport (serves the Inland Empire); Hollywood Burbank Airport (serves the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys); Long Beach Airport (serves the Long Beach/Harbor area); and John Wayne Airport (serves the Orange County area).

The world&#x27;s busiest general-aviation airport is also located in Los Angeles, Van Nuys Airport. Santa Monica Airport is also located near Los Angeles.

===Intercity train services===
Union Station is the major regional train station for Amtrak, Metrolink and Metro Rail. The station is Amtrak&#x27;s fifth busiest station, having 1.4 million Amtrak boardings and de-boardings in 2019. Amtrak operates eleven daily round trips between San Diego and Los Angeles, five of which continue to Santa Barbara via the Pacific Surfliner, the only service that runs through Los Angeles multiple times daily. Two of those trips continue to San Luis Obispo, California. The Coast Starlight provides additional service on the route and beyond to the San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, and on to Seattle, Washington. Amtrak motor coaches connect from Los Angeles to the San Joaquin Route in Bakersfield with frequent service through the Central Valley of California to Sacramento and Oakland, and eastward to San Bernardino and Las Vegas.

There is also daily service to Chicago, Illinois on the Southwest Chief, and three times a week to New Orleans, Louisiana on the Sunset Limited. Due to the effects from Hurricane Katrina, Sunset Limited service between New Orleans to Jacksonville, Florida has been discontinued, although Amtrak is required by current federal law to develop a plan to reinstate the service. The Texas Eagle is a second train to Chicago, which operates thrice weekly. Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle trains operate as one train between Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas before splitting off towards their respective destinations.

Amtrak Pacific Surfliner trains stop at several locations in Los Angeles County, including: Glendale, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Chatsworth, and Van Nuys.

Due to the large volumes of import freight that flow into the city&#x27;s port complex, Los Angeles is a major freight railroad hub. Freight is hauled by Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway. The now-defunct Southern Pacific Railroad once served the Los Angeles area before merging with Union Pacific. The Alameda Corridor, a below-grade rail corridor connects the port to the city&#x27;s main rail yards and to points further north and east.

The California High-Speed Rail plans to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco and San Diego via the Inland Empire. Additionally, the Brightline West will serve Los Angeles to Las Vegas via Rancho Cucamonga.

===Intercity freeway===
The major freeway routes providing intercity connections are Interstate 5 (which goes north to Sacramento and south to San Diego), U.S. Route 101 (which goes north to Santa Barbara and San Francisco), and Interstate 10 (which goes west to Santa Monica and east to Phoenix, Arizona).

===Intercity bus services===
Greyhound, FlixBus, and various smaller bus lines provide intercity bus services. Greyhound connects directly to Bakersfield and from there into the California Central Valley, San Diego, Las Vegas, and the San Francisco Bay area. It departs from Los Angeles at its main station located in southeast downtown Los Angeles and from a secondary terminal located in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

===Harbors===
The Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro neighborhood, approximately south of Downtown. Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT L.A., the port complex occupies of land and water along of waterfront. It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach. There are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along L.A.&#x27;s coastline. Most of these like Redondo Beach and Marina del Rey are used primarily by sailboats and yachts.

The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach comprise the largest seaport complex in the United States and the fifth busiest in the world. Over 11 percent of United States international trade (by value) passes through the Los Angeles region, and the Los Angeles customs district collects over 37 percent of the nation’s import duties.

The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Henry Ford Bridge, Gerald Desmond Bridge, and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge.

=== Ferry services ===
There are ferries serving the offshore island community of Avalon, California; they are mainly used for day excursions and to move supplies to Catalina Island. There is no regular vehicle ferry service to Avalon, since the city restricts the use of cars and trucks within its borders.

==Intracity==


=== Freeways ===

There are a dozen major freeways that crisscross the region. California&#x27;s first freeway was the Arroyo Seco Parkway segment of California State Route 110, also known as the Pasadena Freeway. It opened on January 1, 1940 and links downtown Los Angeles to downtown Pasadena. From Chavez Ravine north to Pasadena it can be quite dangerous because there is no shoulder, the lanes are narrow, the turns are sharp (not always properly banked), and the ramps are quite short and offer little room for acceleration to freeway speed. The route is often described as a hybridization of older parkway designs and more modern freeway designs. Commercial vehicles over are prohibited from using this freeway. Newer freeways are straighter, wider, and allow for higher speeds.

Major freeways in Los Angeles include:

* Glendale Freeway
* Santa Ana Freeway
* Golden State Freeway
* Santa Monica Freeway/San Bernardino Freeway
* Antelope Valley Freeway
* Seaside Freeway
* Pomona Freeway
* Marina Freeway
* Gardena Freeway
* Hollywood Freeway
* Ventura Freeway
* Terminal Island Freeway
* Glenn M. Anderson Freeway/Century Freeway
* Harbor Freeway
* Arroyo Seco Parkway
* Ronald Reagan Freeway
* Foothill Freeway
* San Diego Freeway
* Long Beach Freeway

Major highways in Los Angeles include:

* Pacific Coast Highway/Lincoln Boulevard
* Santa Monica Boulevard
* Decker Canyon Road
* Topanga Canyon Boulevard
* Alameda Street
* Slauson Avenue
* Highland Avenue
* Venice Boulevard

Angelenos are noted for referring to freeways with the definite article (&quot;The 101&quot;), in contrast to most other areas of the United States, who omit the article. Referring to freeways by name, for example &quot;The San Diego Freeway&quot;, is essentially a holdover from the time when the freeways were built, and is diminishing. Freeways continue to be officially named; for example, State Route 118 was christened the Ronald Reagan Freeway.

=== Rush hour ===

Los Angeles has synchronized its traffic lights. The mean travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles&#x27; mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, DC. Rush hour occurs on weekdays between 5 am and 10 am, and in the afternoon between 3 pm and 7 pm (although rush-hour traffic can occasionally spill out to 11 am and start again from 2 pm until as late as 10 pm, especially on Fridays). Traffic can occur at almost any time, particularly before major holidays (including Thanksgiving, Christmas, and three-day weekends) and even on regular weekends when one otherwise would not expect it.

===Streets, street layout, the boulevards, and street problems===

The city has an extensive street grid. Arterial streets (referred to as &quot;surface streets&quot; by locals, in contrast with freeways which are usually grade-separated roadways) connect freeways with smaller neighborhood streets, and are often used to bypass congested freeway routes. Consequently, most of the surface arterial streets in Los Angeles have various forms of congestion control.

Some of the more common means of maintaining surface street traffic flow is the use of loop-sensors embedded in the pavement allowing for intersection traffic signal timing adjustments to favor the more heavily delayed roadways; the use of a traffic control system allows for the synchronization of traffic signals to improve traffic flow (as of October 2009 this system is currently installed at 85% of the city&#x27;s signalized intersections, more than any other US city); restrictions on vehicle turns on roadways without designated turning lanes during rush-hours; and the extensive use of rush-hour parking restrictions, allowing for an extra lane of travel in each direction during peak hours (weekdays excluding holidays generally from 7-9am thru 4-7pm, although hours vary by location) by eliminating on street parking and standing of vehicles, with violators being ticketed, and in the case of priority routes known as &quot;anti-gridlock zones&quot;, immediately towed by specialized enforcement teams dubbed &quot;tiger teams&quot; at steep cost to the violator.

1st Street divides the block numbering grid north and south, and southwest of the Los Angeles River, Main Street divides the city east and west. Northeast of the river, block designations are divided east and west by Pasadena Avenue and North Figueroa Street.

From downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, in a straight-down vertical pattern, east–west streets are numbered (starting with 1st Street in downtown, to 266th Street in Harbor City), and north–south streets are named. (1st Street is one block south of Temple.) There are many exceptions to the numbered streets, but the above pattern is generally used. This same numbered pattern is not mirrored north of Temple. Addresses are then numbered east or west stemming from Main Street (a major north south artery). Therefore, the landmark Watts Towers at 1765 E. 107th Street is approximately 107 streets south of 1st Street, and on the 17th street east of Main Street. Although the numbered streets are sequential, they do not necessarily equal the number of blocks south of 1st Street, as there are streets such as 118th Street and then 118th Place.

Many of the numbered streets also continue into neighboring cities, but some cities, such as Manhattan Beach, have made their own numbered street grid. Also, some districts of Los Angeles, such as Wilmington, San Pedro, Venice, and Playa Del Rey have their own numbered street grids.

Many arterials have been labeled as boulevards, and many of those mentioned below have been immortalized in movies, music, and literature.

Major east–west routes include: Roscoe, Victory, Ventura, Hollywood, Sunset, Santa Monica, Beverly, Wilshire, Olympic, Pico, Venice, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Exposition, Obama Boulevard, and Martin Luther King Jr (formerly Santa Barbara Avenue), and Century Boulevard. The major north–south routes include: Topanga Canyon, Crenshaw, Reseda, Lincoln, Sepulveda, Van Nuys, Westwood, Beverly Glen, San Vicente, Robertson, La Cienega, Laurel Canyon, Glendale, Avalon Boulevard, and Main Street.

There are many other famous L.A. streets which carry significant traffic but are not labeled as boulevards. Examples include: Broadway, Bundy Drive, Barrington Avenue, Centinela Avenue, Fountain Avenue, Mulholland Drive, Slauson Avenue, Pacific Coast Highway, Century Park East, Avenue of the Stars, Century Park West, Normandie Avenue, Highland Avenue, Melrose Avenue, Florence Avenue, Manchester Avenue, Vermont Avenue, La Brea Avenue, Fairfax Avenue, Western Avenue, Van Ness Avenue, Figueroa Street, Grand Avenue, Huntington Drive, Central Avenue, Alameda Street, and Imperial Highway. West Los Angeles has many streets named after states that run east and west. Somewhat confusingly, adjacent Santa Monica uses a few of the same state names for different streets of its own.

Potholes are a notorious problem in Los Angeles and frequently cause severe damage to all kinds of vehicles. In 2008, then-mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made &quot;Operation Pothole&quot; one of his top priorities for that year and pledged to fill 1 million potholes. Due to the city&#x27;s poorly managed budget, the city&#x27;s Bureau of Street Services had only a single dedicated pothole-repair truck to cover of streets. Many city streets, such as Wilshire Boulevard, were engineered when cars, trucks, and buses were much smaller, and desperately need to be torn up and rebuilt from scratch to handle the weight of today&#x27;s larger vehicles.

Furthermore, due to its severe budget problems, Los Angeles is one of the few California cities that does not use raised pavement markers on its streets. Thus, Los Angeles drivers must be vigilant not only for potholes, but for other drivers drifting out of lanes due to the lack of tactile feedback normally provided by such markers.

=== On foot ===
In congruence with the assertion of a popular song that &quot;nobody walks in L.A.&quot;, only 3.5% of Los Angeles residents commuted to work by walking in 2016 and Los Angeles residents walk for exercise at rates similar to those of other major U.S. cities.

Downtown Los Angeles has numerous public escalators and skyways, such as the Bunker Hill steps to facilitate pedestrian traffic in the traffic-laden and hilly terrain. Downtown Los Angeles is one of two neighborhoods in Los Angeles ranked as a &quot;walker&#x27;s paradise&quot; (with walk scores 90 or above) by Walkscore. The other is Mid-City West, which encompasses the area of the city immediately south of West Hollywood and east of Beverly Hills.

Much of Los Angeles remains pedestrian unfriendly. A large percentage of sidewalks in the City of Los Angeles (43% or of the ) are in ill repair stemming from the City Council decision in 1973 to use the federal money they had to take over the responsibility from the adjacent property owners. Previously they had conformed to California law which puts the responsibility for repair of sidewalks on the property owners. As certain popular species of trees accelerated the damage caused by roots, the council failed to concurrently allocate funds for continuing city repairs of such sidewalks. Voters were unwilling to approve funding repairs with a tax or a bond measure. The city again began dedicating funds for sidewalk repairs in 2000 but defunded the program during the Great Recession. In 2015, the city agreed to a landmark legal settlement that would fix the backlog of broken sidewalks and make other improvements to help those with disabilities navigate the city. The biggest agreement of its kind in U.S. history would settle a lawsuit on behalf of people in wheelchairs or others with mobility impairments who argued that crumbling, impassable sidewalks and other barriers were a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act since they were prevented from accessing public pathways. In 2024, Mayor Karen Bass signed an executive directive designating a single committee tasked with coordinating the maintenance, delivery and development of street projects. Made up of general managers from nine city divisions, it will coordinate the work of the different departments and bureaus that deal with the concrete, asphalt, street lighting, bike lanes, storm water drains and parks.

=== Bicycle travel ===
Bicycling accounts for approximately 1% of Los Angeles commuting and has almost doubled in the last ten years. People in Los Angeles commute to work by bicycle about twice as frequently as the US average There are extended stretches of bicycle paths such as the Los Angeles River bicycle path, which runs from Burbank to Long Beach, with only a brief hiatus through downtown.

=== Mass transit ===

The primary regional public transportation agency is the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), commonly referred to as Metro or MTA. The agency, which operates bus, light rail and subway services, averages 767,000 transit trips per weekday. It is the third largest transit agency in the United States. Other municipal transportation agencies in Los Angeles County (LADOT, Long Beach Transit, Montebello Bus Lines, Norwalk Transit, Redondo Beach, Santa Monica&#x27;s Big Blue Bus, Santa Clarita Transit, Torrance Transit and Foothill Transit) have an additional 405,000 average weekday boardings.

In February 2008, LACMTA introduced the Transit Access Pass (TAP) universal fare system. The TAP smart card allows bus and rail passengers to tap their cards on the farebox for faster boarding. TAP readers are installed on bus fareboxes and on turnstiles and standalone validators at rail stations. Because not all Metro Rail stations have turnstiles, it operates on a proof-of-payment system: as such, Metro&#x27;s fare inspectors randomly check to make sure TAP users have validated their card by using a wireless handheld unit. TAP is now accepted on a number of different transit systems in Los Angeles County.

====Buses====
The extensive bus system operated by LACMTA includes the Metro Local, Metro Rapid, and formerly Metro Express services. Local buses tend to be orange, rapid buses red, and express buses blue. Rapid bus route numbers usually begin with a 7 and express bus numbers begin with 4 and 5. The buses have an estimated 1.3 million boardings on the weekdays. Including other municipal bus operators, Los Angeles County averages 1.7 million bus boardings per weekday, accounting for approximately 5.9% of the 29 million daily trips originating in Los Angeles County.

LACMTA has two bus rapid transit lines: the G Line and the J Line.

The G Line runs from Chatsworth station to North Hollywood station and began operations on October 29, 2005 as the Orange Line. For the entirety of its length, the articulated buses, built by North American Bus Industries and dubbed &quot;Metro Liners&quot;, operate on bus-only lanes that follow an old railroad right-of-way. Portions of the route parallel Chandler and Victory Boulevards, and Oxnard Street.

The J Line runs along Interstate 10 and Interstate 110 between El Monte Station and downtown San Pedro.

Foothill Transit also operates a bus rapid transit system called the Silver Streak, which runs from Montclair to Downtown Los Angeles along the El Monte Busway on Interstate 10.

Other bus systems:
* Culver CityBus - green (local) and grey (rapid)
* Santa Monica&#x27;s Big Blue Bus
* Montebello Bus Lines
* Numerous other municipal bus systems

====Metro Rail====
Between its light rail and heavy rail systems, Metro Rail has of rail, averaging 308,653 trips per weekday, and accounting for approximately 1.1% of the 29 million daily trips originating in Los Angeles County. The network includes four above-ground light rail lines (the A, C, E, and K lines) and one underground subway with two branches (the B and D lines). The Los Angeles Metro Rail ranked by daily ridership as the ninth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States. Ranked by passengers per route mile, however, the system ranks sixth, transporting 8,846 passengers per route mile, more than San Francisco&#x27;s Bay Area Rapid Transit or the Chicago &quot;L&quot;.

The Los Angeles Metro Rail system connects areas across the county, including Long Beach, Pasadena, Norwalk, El Segundo, North Hollywood, Inglewood and Downtown Los Angeles. As of 2023, four additional rail expansion projects are under construction, and various other projects are under study. The timing of their construction will depend on the availability of funding. These projects include:
* A connection of the C and K lines to LAX through a people mover (under construction).
* A westward extension of the D Line subway to Westwood, thru UCLA and Central LA (under construction).
* A further extension of the A Line from Azusa to Pomona, named the Foothill Extension (under construction).
* A further extension of the E Line from East Los Angeles to Whittier, Phase 2 of the Eastside Transit Corridor (final study stages).
* The new East San Fernando Valley Light Rail Transit Project in the San Fernando Valley is set to start construction in 2023.
* A C Line Extension to Torrance is under study, the southern terminus located in the South Bay area. 
* A new LRT line through the Gateway Cities is under study, named the Southeast Gateway Line from Downtown Los Angeles to Artesia. 
* A new HRT subway line corridor has started study from the San Fernando Valley to UCLA and eventually LAX. The Sepulveda Transit Corridor.
* A northern extension of the K line from Crenshaw to West Hollywood and a connection to the Hollywood Bowl. Currently under study. Called the K Line Northern Extension.
* An eastern extension of the D line in Downtown Los Angeles with a single new station in the Arts District. 
* A new BRT or HRT line on a north-to-south route along Vermont Avenue is currently under study.
* Metro plans to convert the BRT G Line into an LRT line.
* Metro also plans to begin a study of a BRT or LRT line from LAX to Santa Monica along Lincoln Boulevard.

====Commuter rail====
Also serving Los Angeles and several surrounding counties is Metrolink, a regional commuter rail service. Metrolink averages 42,600 trips per weekday, the busiest line being the San Bernardino line.

====Los Angeles public transportation statistics====
The city of Los Angeles has, a low rate of public transportation use compared to similar sized American cities, with only 7.7% of commuters getting to work by this means in 2021. The city&#x27;s average one-way commute was approximately 29 minutes in 2021. 31% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 minutes, while 38% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 30% travel for over in a single direction.

===Vehicle for hire companies===
Vehicle for hire companies face numerous regulations in California.

Taxis in Los Angeles are regulated by the Board of Taxicab Commissioners. There are 9 taxi companies in Los Angeles that operate more than 2,300 taxis. Some of the largest Taxi companies in Los Angeles are LA Yellow Cab, Bell Cab, and United Independent Taxi. RideYellow, Curb and Flywheel are three of the most popular mobile apps providing taxi service in Los Angeles.

Uber and Lyft operate in Los Angeles.

=== Superbloom street lights ===
In November 2019, Los Angeles Chief Design Officer Christopher Hawthorne launched L.A. Lights The Way under the supervision of Mayor Eric Garcetti, an open competition to design and fabricate a new, improved, and multi-use standard LED powered street light to be installed and supplant the 220,000 existing less efficient high pressure sodium street lamps and the current single-function, utilitarian, LED-operated CD953 model streetlight that has been standardized throughout Los Angeles since 2009. According to Hawthorne, the L.A. Lights the Way initiative serves as an opportunity &quot;to reconnect with the city&#x27;s &#x27;rich tradition&#x27; of streetlight modernization,&quot; a potential way to &quot;mitigate the unequal distribution of the city&#x27;s &#x27;most beautiful&#x27; streetlights, which are currently concentrated in the wealthiest neighborhoods,&quot; and as an avenue through which to establish Smart City infrastructure throughout Los Angeles. Additionally, the timeliness of the design competition echoes the larger, city-wide efforts to refurbish and modernize the city’s public environment in preparation for the 2028 Olympic Games (though the L.A. Lights The Way initiative is not explicitly included in Garcetti&#x27;s Twenty-eight by &#x27;28 transit infrastructure plan).

On September 3, 2020, Hawthorne announced via Twitter that of the over 100 anonymous global entries, the winner of the contest’s $70,000 prize was the Superbloom concept, coincidentally created by the L.A.-based design studio Project Room. The Superbloom street light is a modular-designed system that, according to project leader Sandy Yum, employs biomimicry in the form a bouquet of flowers, with each metal tubular “flower” serving a distinct technological or physical feature. Yum describes the design focus of the Superbloom concept was, &quot;to take the ever increasing number of things we demand from our streetlights — shade, traffic sensors, telecom, EV charging, wayfinding, banners, the list goes on — and translate that into a form that is uniquely LA.&quot; The Superbloom concept, according to Project Room, embodies a systems-based approach to engineering municipal infrastructure, and that the Superbloom system anticipates and invites future innovations given that extra “tubes are built in to the design for future use. Additional arms can be quickly and affordably fabricated. The streetlight expresses its purposes as simply as possible and yet remains open to change and to the future.”

The proposed Superbloom system is designed to incorporate features that have the potential to mitigate the detrimental effects of the various environmentally racist modern urban design phenomena, such as increasing the amount shade to combat urban heat islands that are disproportionately found in low-income communities of color. Concerned citizens, media outlets, and other advocates of environmental justice have also noted the potential racial and class-oriented implications of security lighting, claiming that such an interconnected, municipally owned system has the potential to expand and streamline the LAPD&#x27;s preexisting practice of mounting &quot;security cameras, gunshot monitors, and other surveillance tools,&quot; thus increasing the potential for the over-policing and subsequent racial profiling of lower-income or racially/ethnically homogenous neighborhoods.

==Commuting==

In 2021, of the 6.8 million workers who commuted in the Los Angeles-Long Beach metro area, 81.6% commuted to work driving alone, 10.9% commuted by driving in a carpool and 2.7% commuted on public transportation. In 2006, 64.9% of public transportation commuters were non-white, 70.2% were Hispanic and 67.6% were foreign born. 75.5% of public transportation commuters earned less than $25,000. However, only 32.7% of public transportation commuters had no vehicle available to them for their commute.

In the same year, for the City of Los Angeles, of the 1.4 million workers who commuted, 74.7% commuted to work driving alone, 10.7% commuted by driving in a carpool, 7.7% commuted by public transportation, and 3.5% walked. The percentage of population using public transport in Los Angeles is lower than other large U.S. cities such as San Francisco, Chicago and New York, but similar to or higher than other western U.S. cities such as Portland and Denver. 63.8% of public transportation commuters in the City of Los Angeles in 2006 were non-white, 75.1% were Hispanic and 73.9% were foreign born. 79.4% of public transportation commuters earned less than $25,000 and 37.6% had no vehicle available to them for their commute.
Driving alone has increased at the expense of public transportation in recent years, with the most marked decline occurring between 2019 and 2021 due to commute pattern changes coincident with COVID-19. According to the American Community Survey, only 70.6% of workers who commuted in the City of Los Angeles did so by driving alone in 2006, and 11.5% used public transportation. The percent of workers commuting by public transportation had slowly fallen to 9.5% in 2019 before falling further to 7.7% in 2021. The number of commuters by public transit fell from 177,099 in 2019 to 106,300 in 2021, as the number of workers working from home increased from 130,409 to 432,722.

==Concerns ==
===Air quality===

Los Angeles is strongly predisposed to accumulation of smog, because of peculiarities of its geography and weather patterns. The millions of vehicles in the area combined with the additional effects of the Los Angeles/Long Beach complex frequently contribute to further air pollution. Los Angeles was one of the best known cities suffering from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was a synonym for &quot;smog&quot;. In particular, the entire area in between Los Angeles Harbor and Riverside has become known as the &quot;Diesel Death Zone&quot;.

The American Lung Association&#x27;s 2023 State of the Air Report ranks the Los Angeles-Long Beach metro area as the most polluted in the United States for ozone. However, for year-round particulate matter, the metro area is outranked by three metro areas in the San Joaquin Valley, namely Bakersfield, Visalia and Fresno-Madera-Hanford. For short-term particulate matter, it is outranked by those same three metro areas as well as number of additional California metro areas such as San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, as well as Fairbanks, Alaska.

===Sidewalks===

The city has about of sidewalk. Many are perilous or impassable due to lack of maintenance to those who have disabilities that affect their mobility. In 2015, the city committed to spending $1.4 billion over the next 30 years to resolved a class-action lawsuit citing violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act by fixing other barriers to full and safe access to city streets.

<doc id="1156993" wikidata="Q2192732" url="?curid=1156993" title="Rolling">
<text>Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding.

Rolling where there is no sliding is referred to as &quot;pure rolling&quot;. By definition, there is no sliding when there is a frame of reference in which all points of contact on the rolling object have the same velocity as their counterparts on the surface on which the object rolls; in particular, for a frame of reference in which the rolling plane is at rest (see animation), the instantaneous velocity of all the points of contact (for instance, a generating line segment of a cylinder) of the rolling object is zero.

In practice, due to small deformations near the contact area, some sliding and energy dissipation occurs. Nevertheless, the resulting rolling resistance is much lower than sliding friction, and thus, rolling objects typically require much less energy to be moved than sliding ones. As a result, such objects will more easily move, if they experience a force with a component along the surface, for instance gravity on a tilted surface, wind, pushing, pulling, or torque from an engine. Unlike cylindrical axially symmetric objects, the rolling motion of a cone is such that while rolling on a flat surface, its center of gravity performs a circular motion, rather than a linear motion. Rolling objects are not necessarily axially-symmetrical. Two well known non-axially-symmetrical rollers are the Reuleaux triangle and the Meissner bodies. The oloid and the sphericon are members of a special family of developable rollers that develop their entire surface when rolling down a flat plane. Objects with corners, such as dice, roll by successive rotations about the edge or corner which is in contact with the surface. The construction of a specific surface allows even a perfect square wheel to roll with its centroid at constant height above a reference plane.

== Applications ==

Most land vehicles use wheels and therefore rolling for displacement. Slip should be kept to a minimum (approximating pure rolling), otherwise loss of control and an accident may result. This may happen when the road is covered in snow, sand, or oil, when taking a turn at high speed or attempting to brake or accelerate suddenly.

One of the most practical applications of rolling objects is the use of rolling-element bearings, such as ball bearings, in rotating devices. Made of metal, the rolling elements are usually encased between two rings that can rotate independently of each other. In most mechanisms, the inner ring is attached to a stationary shaft (or axle). Thus, while the inner ring is stationary, the outer ring is free to move with very little friction. This is the basis for which almost all motors (such as those found in ceiling fans, cars, drills, etc.) rely on to operate. Alternatively, the outer ring may be attached to a fixed support bracket, allowing the inner ring to support an axle, allowing for rotational freedom of an axle. The amount of friction on the mechanism&#x27;s parts depends on the quality of the ball bearings and how much lubrication is in the mechanism.

Rolling objects are also frequently used as tools for transportation. One of the most basic ways is by placing a (usually flat) object on a series of lined-up rollers, or wheels. The object on the wheels can be moved along them in a straight line, as long as the wheels are continuously replaced in the front (see history of bearings). This method of primitive transportation is efficient when no other machinery is available. Today, the most practical application of objects on wheels are cars, trains, and other human transportation vehicles.

Rolling is used to apply normal forces to a moving line of contact in various processes, for example in metalworking, printing, rubber manufacturing, painting.

== Rigid bodies ==

The simplest case of rolling is that of a rigid body rolling without slipping along a flat surface with its axis parallel to the surface (or equivalently: perpendicular to the surface normal).

The trajectory of any point is a trochoid; in particular, the trajectory of any point in the object axis is a line, while the trajectory of any point in the object rim is a cycloid.

The velocity of any point in the rolling object is given by formula_1, where formula_2 is the displacement between the particle and the rolling object&#x27;s contact point (or line) with the surface, and ω is the angular velocity vector. Thus, despite that rolling is different from rotation around a fixed axis, the &quot;instantaneous velocity&quot; of all particles of the rolling object is the same as if it was rotating around an axis that passes through the point of contact with the same angular velocity.

Any point in the rolling object farther from the axis than the point of contact will temporarily move opposite to the direction of the overall motion when it is below the level of the rolling surface (for example, any point in the part of the flange of a train wheel that is below the rail).

=== Energy ===
Since kinetic energy is entirely a function of an object mass and velocity, the above result may be used with the parallel axis theorem to obtain the kinetic energy associated with simple rolling

formula_3

=== Forces and acceleration ===
Differentiating the relation between linear and angular &quot;velocity&quot;, formula_4, with respect to time gives a formula relating linear and angular &quot;acceleration&quot; formula_5. Applying Newton&#x27;s second law:

formula_6

It follows that to accelerate the object, both a net force and a torque are required. When external force with no torque acts on the rolling object‐surface system, there will be a tangential force at the point of contact between the surface and rolling object that provides the required torque as long as the motion is pure rolling; this force is usually static friction, for example, between the road and a wheel or between a bowling lane and a bowling ball. When static friction isn&#x27;t enough, the friction becomes dynamic friction and slipping happens. The tangential force is opposite in direction to the external force, and therefore partially cancels it. The resulting net force and acceleration are:

formula_7

formula_8 has dimension of mass, and it is the mass that would have a rotational inertia formula_9 at distance formula_10 from an axis of rotation. Therefore, the term formula_8 may be thought of as the mass with linear inertia equivalent to the rolling object rotational inertia (around its center of mass). The action of the external force upon an object in simple rotation may be conceptualized as accelerating the sum of the real mass and the virtual mass that represents the rotational inertia, which is formula_12. Since the work done by the external force is split between overcoming the translational and rotational inertia, the external force results in a smaller net force by the dimensionless multiplicative factor formula_13 where formula_14 represents the ratio of the aforesaid virtual mass to the object actual mass and it is equal to formula_15 where formula_16 is the radius of gyration corresponding to the object rotational inertia in pure rotation (not the rotational inertia in pure rolling). The square power is due to the fact rotational inertia of a point mass varies proportionally to the square of its distance to the axis.
In the specific case of an object rolling in an inclined plane which experiences only static friction, normal force and its own weight, (air drag is absent) the acceleration in the direction of rolling down the slope is:

formula_17

formula_18 is specific to the object shape and mass distribution, it does not depend on scale or density. However, it will vary if the object is made to roll with different radiuses; for instance, it varies between a train wheel set rolling normally (by its tire), and by its axle. It follows that given a reference rolling object, another object bigger or with different density will roll with the same acceleration. This behavior is the same as that of an object in free fall or an object sliding without friction (instead of rolling) down an inclined plane.

== Deformable bodies ==

When an axisymmetric deformable body contacts a surface, an interface is formed through which normal and shear forces may be transmitted. For example, a tire contacting the road carries the weight (normal load) of the car as well as any shear forces arising due to acceleration, braking or steering. The deformations and motions in a steady rolling body can be efficiently characterized using an Eulerian description of rigid body rotation and a Lagrangian description of deformation. This approach greatly simplifies analysis by eliminating time-dependence, resulting in displacement, velocity, stress and strain fields that vary only spatially. Analysis procedures for finite element analysis of steady state rolling were first developed by Padovan, and are now featured in several commercial codes.

<doc id="1156995" wikidata="Q864389" url="?curid=1156995" title="Nintendogs">
<text>(stylized in all lowercase) is a real-time pet simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It was released in Japan, and was later released in: North America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: &quot;Dachshund &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Lab &amp; Friends&quot; (&quot;Shiba &amp; Friends&quot; in Japan) and &quot;Chihuahua &amp; Friends&quot;. It has been re-released twice, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called &quot;Nintendogs: Best Friends&quot; and later as &quot;Nintendogs: Dalmatian &amp; Friends&quot;.

&quot;Nintendogs&quot; uses the DS&#x27;s touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player&#x27;s dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;roll over&quot;. Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS&#x27;s wireless linkup. It also uses the DS&#x27;s internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.

&quot;Nintendogs&quot; received positive reviews from critics and won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from &quot;PC World&quot; and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. All versions of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; have sold a combined 23.96 million copies worldwide, making it the second highest-selling game on the Nintendo DS, behind &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; Because of &quot;Nintendogs&quot;″ success, Nintendo has made several related products, including &quot;Nintendogs&quot; toys and a series of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; trading cards. A sequel, titled &quot;Nintendogs + Cats&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Nintendogs&quot; uses the DS&#x27; touchscreen, where the owner can: play with, train, pet, walk, brush and wash a virtual dog. The game also utilizes the built-in microphone, where the player can call their puppy or teach the puppy tricks. Money can be earned by placing in competitions or selling items at the secondhand shop and can be used to purchase supplies, puppies and home decor. Dogs can be walked and can be taken to the park where they can practice disc catching skills for disc competitions and to the gymnasium to practice dog agility for agility trials. While walking, question mark icons on the map point out areas that may contain neighborhood dogs or presents, though presents can be found unmarked as well. 

Only three dogs may be kept at the player&#x27;s house at one time and up to five dogs can stay at the dog hotel, where dogs can be swapped, dropped off and picked up at any time. The player can also choose to part ways with a dog by donating a dog to the hotel.

As time passes without the dog being cared for, its condition will slowly deteriorate as it becomes more hungry and dirty. The condition of the player&#x27;s dogs can be found by clicking its name. Hunger is listed as: &quot;Full&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Hungry&quot; and &quot;Famished&quot;. Thirst is listed as: &quot;Quenched&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Thirsty&quot; and &quot;Parched&quot;. The condition of the dog&#x27;s coat is listed as: &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Clean&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Dirty&quot; and &quot;Filthy&quot;.

&quot;Nintendogs&quot; features a variety of contests, which are the player&#x27;s main method of earning money and trainer points. There are three contests Disc Competition, Agility Trial and Obedience Trial. In each of them, there are 5 classes: &quot;Beginner&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Expert&quot;, &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Championship&quot;. Each contest is commented on by two men, named Ted Rumsworth and Archie Hubbs. If the player&#x27;s dog places 3rd or higher in its class, the dog will proceed to the next class, where the contest increases in difficulty level. Prize money earned differs depending on which contest has been entered, what place is finished and the class the dog is in. If the player does not place in the top three, they will be dropped to the previous difficulty level.

&quot;Nintendogs&quot; allows users to communicate wirelessly to other &quot;Nintendogs&quot; users through Bark Mode. Before activating Wireless Mode, the player can choose to give the other user a present. When another user with Bark Mode activated is nearby, the player will have an opportunity to play with the other trainer&#x27;s dog and if the user has recorded a voice message on their White Record, the other user will hear the voice message.

Dogs do not die, have puppies or age (meaning they remain as puppies).

==Development==
First publicly mentioned in 1997, Shigesato Itoi (designer of &quot;EarthBound&quot;), Tsunekazu Ishihara (designer of &quot;Pokémon&quot;) and Shigeru Miyamoto codeveloped a Nintendo 64 prototype of a pet creature breeding game called &quot;Cabbage&quot;. Its four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the real-time clock and mass writability introduced in the requisite 64DD peripheral &quot;such that even if the power is cut, [the game] can still raise the creature&quot; and with optionally purchasable enhancement data. A subset of creature maintenance functionality would be made portable on the Game Boy and could be synchronized back to the 64DD disk, via the Transfer Pak. It was expected for release in 1998 and then, in 2000, but all further development was distracted. In 2006, Miyamoto concluded: &quot;It disappeared, didn&#x27;t it ... However, the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making &quot;Cabbage&quot; are, of course, connected to &quot;Nintendogs&quot; and other things that we&#x27;re doing now.&quot;

The project which ultimately became &quot;Nintendogs&quot; began as a technical demo on the GameCube long before it was considered for the DS. It was migrated to the DS when the handheld was still in development. Shigeru Miyamoto originally came up with the idea for the game when he and his family bought a dog, which inspired him to create the project. The game&#x27;s producer, Hideki Konno, looking for a game to take full advantage of all of the Nintendo DS&#x27;s features, decided on a dog simulation game. &quot;Nintendogs&quot;, first called &quot;Puppy Times&quot;, was originally designed to have fifteen different versions, one for each breed of dog. Satoru Iwata suggested this to convey the feel that the player was choosing a dog from a kennel. However, the debugging process for each version was deemed too time-consuming to be feasible. After going back and forth between several versions, they eventually settled on three, with six dogs each and the rest available after completing in-game goals.

==Merchandise==
In late 2005, Nintendo of America released the first series of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; &quot;6-Card Fun Paks&quot;. Three different pack designs (each based on the US-released designs of the DS game) contains an assortment of &quot;Collectible cards, stickers &amp; more!&quot;. Each pack randomly contains two of 18 different &quot;Breed&quot; cards, one of nine different &quot;Dog in Training&quot; tip cards, one of six different &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; cards, one of 18 different &quot;Pop-Up&quot; Cards, one of six sundry sheets of stickers, one of four temporary tattoos and one &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; card. Another series of these cards were released in early 2007 by Enterplay, LLC. These cards, officially licensed by Nintendo, were created by the same individuals who worked on the first series. As such, the cards greatly resemble the first series. Keeping the &quot;6-Card Fun Pak&quot; name, each package contains two of 20 different &quot;At the Kennel&quot; cards (which feature all eighteen breeds from the games, including the Dalmatian and Jack Russell Terrier), one of nine &quot;Dog in Training&quot; tip cards, one of four &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; cards, one of 20 &quot;Pop-Up&quot; Cards, one of six sheets of stickers, one of four temporary tattoos and one &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; card. The next series also features three sundry packages, this time with a Dalmatian, Beagle and Pug on the front of the package.

A line of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; plush toys were released in Japan, featuring the most popular breeds in each game. They are also available at the Nintendo World Store. Various &quot;Nintendogs&quot; T-shirts were also made available at the Nintendo World Store. In Europe and Australia, a series of plush toys with an electronic sensor were released, and when the owner shook the bone, the dog would walk and bark. Nintendo has also released a set of plushes through Earthwood Toys. 

Nintendo also commissioned several specially designed Nintendo DS systems to tie in with the game&#x27;s release, with one of them being a diamond-studded pink Nintendo DS designed by Peach NYC. This particular DS went up for auction in 2024, with bids easily exceeding nearly $20,000.

==Reception==
The game was well received by critics, with an average score of 85% at Game Rankings. In the May 2005 edition of the &quot;Famitsu&quot;, Japan&#x27;s most popular gaming magazine, &quot;Nintendogs&quot; received a perfect 40/40 score. Only four other games had attained this score at the time. It also received an 8.5 out of 10 in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; gave &quot;Nintendogs&quot; an 8 out of 10, reflecting on the game&#x27;s lack of an ending. Game Oracle gave it 85% and a recommendation saying that unlike most sims, it has a lot of depth.

===Sales===
In the first week of its release in Japan (April 18, 2005, to April 24, 2005), the three versions, &quot;Shiba Inu &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Miniature Dachshund &amp; Friends&quot; and &quot;Chihuahua &amp; Friends&quot;, sold 75,000, 49,000 and 44,000, respectively, totalling 168,000 units. This title game also boosted the Nintendo DS system sales by over 4.2 times the previous week to 95,000 units, up from 22,000. It was the 91st best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 142,591 copies combined, with cumulative Japanese sales of 1,850,984 combined by 2008.

In Europe, it was the top-selling Nintendo game of 2005 with copies sold that year. The game went on to sell copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling Nintendo DS game of all time. According to Nintendo, the majority of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; owners were female.

ELSPA also gave &quot;Dalmatian &amp; Friends&quot; a &quot;Platinum&quot; award, for at least 300,000 sales in the United Kingdom. By August 2006, in the United States, &quot;Chihuahua &amp; Friends&quot; had sold 570,000 copies and earned $17 million; &quot;Labrador &amp; Friends&quot; had sold 620,000 copies and earned $19 million; and &quot;Dachshund &amp; Friends&quot; had sold 730,000 copies and earned $22 million. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, the games were respectively the 50th, 44th and 32nd highest-selling games launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in the United States.

On March 23, 2006 at GDC 2006, Nintendo&#x27;s president Satoru Iwata announced that international sales of &quot;Nintendogs&quot; sales had reached 6 million. By March 31, 2008, the game was the best-selling Nintendo DS game published by Nintendo. As of March 31, 2015, the combined sales of all versions has reached 23.96 million and it is now second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list behind &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;.

===Legacy===
In 2010, &quot;1UP.com&quot; included &quot;Nintendogs&quot; in their list of five &quot;Essential Newcomers&quot; of the decade, describing it as one of &quot;five revolutionary new games&quot; of the past 10 years, for its impact on drawing &quot;non-gamers to console and portable systems&quot; and establishing the &quot;new&quot; Nintendo. Despite derision from many hardcore gamers, &quot;Nintendogs&quot; sold tens of millions, mostly among casual gamers and paved the way for the Nintendo DS&#x27;s worldwide success. This gave rise to a non-game trend, previously limited to PCs, on consoles and portables. Nintendo followed it up with more casual games such as &quot;Brain Age&quot;, &quot;Wii Sports&quot; and &quot;Wii Fit&quot;, establishing Nintendo as the most successful developer and publisher of the decade.

==Sequel and later references==

It was announced during Nintendo&#x27;s 2010 E3 presentation that Shigeru Miyamoto was working on a new &quot;Nintendogs&quot; project, involving some new innovations. The game, titled &quot;Nintendogs + Cats&quot; was finished in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS and was released as a launch title in all regions.

A microgame based on &quot;Nintendogs&quot; appears in the game &quot;&quot;. A &quot;Nintendogs&quot; Labrador Retriever puppy also appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; as an assist trophy; owing to the nonviolent nature of the &quot;Nintendogs&quot; game, rather than fighting actively, the dog &quot;plays&quot; in front of the screen, blocking view. A French bulldog appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, taking the role of the Labrador Retriever, and the Nintendo 3DS version features a &quot;Nintendogs + Cats&quot; stage. Both the assist trophy, now represented by a Toy Poodle, and the stage reappear in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Multiple &quot;Nintendogs&quot; themed items are available as downloadable content in &quot;Animal Crossing: City Folk&quot;.

<text>AGD Interactive (AGDI), LLC. is a non-profit company given a fan license to remake Sierra Entertainment&#x27;s popular classic adventure games from the 1980s and early 1990s.

==History==

The Company was founded in 2001 by Britney K. Brimhall and Christopher T. Warren as Tierra Entertainment, the company is best known for their remakes of the popular &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; games. AGD Interactive uses &quot;Adventure Game Studio&quot; to create their games.

On December 10, 2003, they ceased using the name Tierra Entertainment and began referring to themselves as AGD Interactive (&quot;AGD&quot; stands for Anonymous Game Developer). Subsequently, the two lead designers are credited as &quot;Anonymous Game Designer #1&quot; (Britney K. Brimhall) and &quot;Anonymous Game Developer #2&quot; (Christopher T. Warren). Information about the team can be found on their website.

They have also formed a commercial company, Himalaya Studios, which will focus on creating original, point-and-click adventure games with high-resolution graphics.

==Released games==

===King&#x27;s Quest I Remake===
AGDI&#x27;s first release was a critically acclaimed point-and-click remake of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I: Quest for the Crown&quot;, released for download free of charge on August 8, 2001. This remake is known as &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I VGA&quot;. In the month of its initial release, sales of Sierra&#x27;s official &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VIII: The Mask of Eternity&quot; skyrocketed. On January 17, 2009, AGDI released version 4.0 of the game, which, among other improvements, included enhanced backgrounds, the addition of narration vocals, and a new optional feature that can remove the walking dead situations which previously could have caused the game to become impossible to complete.

===King&#x27;s Quest II: Romancing the Stones===

One year after the initial release of their King&#x27;s Quest I remake, on December 3, 2002, AGDI followed up with the release of their second free remake, a complete overhaul of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest II&quot;. This remake is known as King&#x27;s Quest II+: Romancing the Stones. King&#x27;s Quest II+ won the 2002 AGS Awards for Best Game, Best Story, Best Animation, Best Music, Best Scripting, and Best Documentation. Both games have been greeted by Sierra fans with enthusiasm, and consider these remakes almost equal to Sierra&#x27;s later &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI&quot;. On March 14, 2009, AGDI released version 3.0, which features enhanced backgrounds, narrator vocals, character lip-syncing, detailed character portraits, and many other additions that increase the game&#x27;s overall level of quality.

===King&#x27;s Quest III Redux===

In February 2011, AGDI released a remake of King&#x27;s Quest III: To Heir is Human. The game is titled King&#x27;s Quest III Redux, and continues the non-canon plot and lore that was established in AGDI&#x27;s previous King&#x27;s Quest II: Romancing the Stones remake. The game is not a 1:1 remake and is not a complete overhaul like KQ2+ was, but features more fleshed-out characters, new areas, and puzzles not seen in the original Sierra version.

===Quest for Glory II Remake===

AGDI&#x27;s remake of the popular &quot;Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire&quot; was released on August 24, 2008. The remake includes extra content (such as a Saurus Repair Shop that was cut from the original release due to memory constraints), a more interactive battle system, additional dialogue interface options, and the option to have a simplified alleyway layout since the original was hard to navigate. Polygon considers the game to be one of the best fan remakes of a video game ever. PC World&#x27;s Jim Norris also gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, considering it a &quot;hand-polished classic&quot;, and the best of AGD Interactive&#x27;s remakes.

==Canceled games==

===Royal Quest===
The &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; remake was being developed simultaneously with a parody of the same game entitled &quot;Royal Quest: Retrieving Lost Shit&quot;. The game was canceled, as the team &quot;believed that it did not promote the values and tone they were trying to preserve in remaking the old Sierra classics.&quot;

===Space Quest II===
Until early 2002, the AGDI development team was working on a VGA remake of &quot;Space Quest II: Vohaul&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Due to the lead programmer&#x27;s disappearance, the development team did not have the resources required for both the &quot;Space Quest II&quot; remake and the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest II&quot; remake, and the &quot;Space Quest II&quot; remake was put on indefinite hold. A small 3-room demo was released to show the progress up to the point when it was canceled. Infamous Adventures, another development team that remakes classic Sierra games, released a remake in December 2011.

<text>House Hunting Mice is a 1947 American animated comedy short film directed by Chuck Jones and co-written by Michael Maltese and Tedd Pierce. The short was released on September 6, 1947 by Warner Bros. Pictures as part of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series, and features Hubie and Bertie.

==Plot==
The short begins outside a model &quot;home of tomorrow&quot; designed by Frank Lloyd Wrong, Hubie reads the advertisement and calls up Bertie&#x27;s attention. In the hopes of finding a home with plenty of food, the mice head on up to the House to see what&#x27;s inside. Upon entering, Hubie and Bertie are greeted by a robotic voice to the &quot;Super House - The House of Tomorrow&quot;, and are encouraged to test out the modern appliances. Hubie first tests out an &quot;Automatic Phonograph&quot;, which involved a robotic hand throwing a record at a rising phonograph player akin to that of a frisbee, and then an &quot;Automatic Sweeper&quot; demonstrator, which demonstrates a robot that can clean any mess on the floor. Bertie begs Hubie if he can press the next button, of which he allows while watching from a safe distance. However, the button Bertie pressed ends up activating a laundry contraption, which sucks Hubie in and have him go through several cleaning processes before getting folded and placed on a stack of clean clothes. As a result, Hubie slaps Bertie for putting him through that.

This is quickly forgotten, however, as Hubie notices another button labeled &quot;Cheese Dispenser&quot;. Upon pressing it, the dispenser launches a piece of cheese into the floor, which causes the Sweeper robot to activate and discard it into a trash can. Bertie tries to catch the next cheese with a plate, but the plate shatters upon impact. The Sweeper returns to clean up the mess once again, this time throwing Bertie away as a result. Bertie tries to escape, but is thrown away again by the robot. Hubie tricks the Sweeper into jumping out of a window after throwing out a vase, but returns after Bertie answers the front door. He gets discarded once again.

Hubie comes to agree that if they want to have the cheese, they must get rid of the Sweeper first. Hubie drops a box of fire crackers and a lit candle into the floor for the Sweeper to discard. Bertie leaves the trash can again before the robot could discard them both. Upon doing so, it results in an explosion that destroys it. However, its hand was able to press a button labeled &quot;Repair Service&quot;, which summons a repair bot that fixes it up completely. In a last ditch attempt, the two mice nailed the record player shut in the floor and uses the &quot;Automatic Phonograph&quot; to throw an onslaught of records against the wall. Unable to clean the mess at hand, the robot gets fed up, dons a coat and hat, picks up a briefcase, puts an &quot;I Quit!&quot; sign on its closet door, and leaves the house.

Hubie starts to revel in their victory over the Sweeper, but it is short-lived when Bertie spies a button labeled &quot;Spring Cleaning Service&quot; and presses it. This ends up summoning a whole army of Sweeper robots that come straight out of another closet and begin cleaning up the place. Hubie and Bertie try to escape the onslaught, but get caught up in a carpet being rolled up by one of the Sweepers and taken outside. In the cartoon&#x27;s final scene, as the Sweepers begin the carpet beating process and whack the mice in the process, Hubie says &quot;HEY, BOIT! C&#x27;MERE!&quot; and starts repeatedly slapping Bertie for getting them into this recent mess.

== Notes ==
&quot;House Hunting Mice&quot; is essentially a re-imagining of Jones&#x27; 1939 cartoon Dog Gone Modern, which featured The Two Curious Puppies.

It also, among many other animated shorts, features the song &quot;Powerhouse&quot; by Raymond Scott when the automated sweeping robots pursue the two mice.

This cartoon is also the first Warner Bros. cartoon to have its color process in Cinecolor since Beauty and the Beast.

<text>The Appleby Frodingham Railway - Scunthorpe is based at Scunthorpe in North Lincolnshire. The society owns locomotives and rolling stock but not the railway it runs on. The name comes from the Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company, now known as British Steel Limited Scunthorpe after the companies buyout by Greybull Capital in 2016, and after going into compulsory liquidation in 2019, Jingye Group. The railway operates entirely within the Steelworks limits over tracks normally used for moving molten iron, steel and raw materials. Trains travel between , all within the steelworks.

==History==

Occasional excursion trains were run around the Scunthorpe Steel Works site (such as in 1986) using the works&#x27; own locomotives.

In 1990, British Steel PLC were  celebrating their 100 years of  steelmaking at their plant in Scunthorpe. The works asked every department the works were asked to join in with the celebrations. Keith Norris, who was rail traffic manager at the time, spoke with the works loco drivers and it was decided the Rail Traffic Department would borrow a steam engine and a coach to take a group of invited dignitaries around the site. 

After the first tour, over 100  trips were run for school children and  members of the public during the 1990 celebrations. With the last trip in 1990 running in the September, but  requests for tours around the work kept coming in.

At the end of 1990, some of the works  drivers met with British Steel PLC management and asked if they could run the tours again for the following year. And with this, and management is full agreement, the idea of a railway preservation group was born. 

&quot;Belerphon&quot;, borrowed from the Vintage Carriage Trust at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway. British Rail  donated 2 ex-Class 108 DMU Carriages to be used on Rail Tours. RailTours were run throughout the  year and donations collected were put towards the  maintenance of the coaches and rolling stock.

1992 saw the arrival of &quot;Arnold Machin&quot;, an 0-6-0 diesel-electric shunter from (named at the time) East Coast Slag co. which  was overhauled and returned to working order, whilst steam traction was provided by &quot;Sir Berkley&quot;. This locomotive again on loan from the Vintage Carriages Trust. Towards the end of 1992, a member saw an advert in the &quot;Railway Press&quot; for a Polish steam locomotive being sold by a Polish Steelworks. With these locos being ideal for operations around the work, 2 members decided to visit the plant in Poland and &quot;Hutnik&quot; was  purchased and brought back to Scunthorpe.

In 1993, &quot;Hutnik&quot; (Polish for Iron worker) took charge of her first  train, becoming the staple motive power for the next 12 years. 

In 1995, after a members&#x27; purchase, a Pecket 0-4-0 saddle tank was brought to Scunthorpe, and after receiving a full overhaul, joined &quot;Hutnick&quot; hauling passengers.

Since then, the society has been home to many privately owned locomotives and rolling stock, including a Bagnal 0-4-0 Diesel-hydraulic bought by a members consortium and a steam locomotive owned by a group of volunteers at the Derwent Valley Light Railway.

On occasions, internal steelworks (radio controlled) Locomotives have also been used on passenger trains to the delight of visitors, and with many thanks to British Steel.

==Locomotives==
==Rolling Stock==
==Special Events==

Irregular special events are organised such as &#x27;Diesel Days&#x27; where Corus and other visiting locomotives operated a series of trains through the day. For example, in 2003 one of each type of internal steelworks locomotive: a Yorkshire Engine Company &quot;Janus&quot;, a Hunslet &quot;Anchor&quot; Locomotive and a &#x27;High Line locomotive&#x27;, together with an EWS Class 08 were used on the Gala trains, each making one round trip of around using the societies Brake Vans and Class 108 DMU Carriages.

It is not unusual for the passenger trains to be stopped to allow steelworks trains to pass. It is sometimes possible to see trains carrying molten iron from the &quot;Queens&quot; - Blast Furnaces.

<doc id="1157014" wikidata="Q1384822" url="?curid=1157014" title="Pauly Shore">
<text>Paul Montgomery Shore (born February 1, 1968) is an American comedian and actor. He is best known for his roles in 1990s comedy films. Shore began as a stand-up comedian at the age of 17, before becoming an MTV VJ in 1989. This led to a starring role in the comedy film &quot;Encino Man&quot; in 1992, which was a modest hit. He followed this with leading man vehicles, including &quot;Son in Law&quot; (1993), &quot;In the Army Now&quot; (1994) and &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996). Shore provided the voice of Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Zimuruski in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and its direct-to-video sequel, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000).

He directed a semi-autobiographical mockumentary film, &quot;Pauly Shore Is Dead&quot; (2003).

==Early life==
Shore was born Paul Montgomery Shore, the son of Sammy Shore and Mitzi Shore (née Saidel). Sammy Shore was a comedian. He and Mitzi co-founded The Comedy Store with Rudy De Luca. After Sammy and Mitzi Shore divorced, Mitzi owned and operated the Comedy Store as part of the divorce settlement from 1974 until her death. Shore was raised Jewish and grew up in Beverly Hills, California. He graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1986.

==Career==

===Stand-up career===
Inspired by his parents&#x27; work in comedy and show business, a 17-year-old Shore made his stand-up debut at the Alley Cat Bistro in Culver City. &quot;Everyone else in school was filling out their SAT applications, but I just passed mine back. I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to go to college.&quot; Shore was mentored by Sam Kinison and opened several of his sets. While touring the comedy club circuit, Shore cultivated an alter ego persona called &quot;The Weasel&quot;. &quot;The Weasel&quot; involved Shore speaking in a surfer parlance, heavily peppered with dudespeak slang such as &quot;edged&quot;, &quot;melons&quot; and &quot;grinding&quot; as well as his catchphrase, &quot;Hey, BU-DDY.&quot;

===MTV===
Shore&#x27;s big break came as an on-air MTV VJ, a position he held from 1989 to 1994. At the height of his MTV fame, Shore had his own show, &quot;Totally Pauly&quot;, serving as a host on MTV&#x27;s annual Spring Break parties. He also released a music video, &quot;Lisa, Lisa, the One I Adore&quot;. In 1999, Shore reprised his role as the host of MTV&#x27;s spring break when he guest starred on an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

===Film career and other highlights===
In 1992, Shore starred in &quot;Encino Man&quot;, which was a modest hit. The film&#x27;s success propelled Shore to star in additional films, albeit increasingly less successful: &quot;Son in Law&quot; (1993), &quot;In the Army Now&quot; (1994), &quot;Jury Duty&quot; (1995), and &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996). All five films received sharply negative reviews, with the last three each holding a rating below 10% at Rotten Tomatoes. In addition, each of the films grossed less at the box office than the one before. Describing Shore&#x27;s performances in these films, film critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Shore bypasses all categories to achieve a kind of transcendent fingernails-on-the-blackboard effect.&quot; Shore provided the voice of Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Zimuruski in &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and its direct-to-video sequel, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000). 

In 1997, Shore starred in the eponymous TV show &quot;Pauly&quot;, which was cancelled after five episodes aired. He made a cameo appearance in the American rock band Limp Bizkit music video &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; as a pizza deliveryman and a briefer appearance in &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. The Golden Raspberry Awards has recognized Shore&#x27;s film performances several times, awarding him Worst New Star of the Year for &quot;Encino Man&quot;, Worst Actor of the Year for &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, and Worst New Star of the Decade for the 1990s, and nominating him for Worst Actor of the Century (which he lost to Sylvester Stallone).

In 2003, Shore produced, wrote, directed and starred in &quot;Pauly Shore Is Dead&quot;, a semi-autobiographical mockumentary, and in 2005, starred in the short-lived reality television series &quot;Minding the Store&quot;. In 2010, Shore starred in &quot;Adopted&quot;, which sees him traveling to Africa to adopt a child.

In March 2018, Shore appeared as himself in episode 10 of the TV series &quot;Alone Together&quot;.

In January 2024, following a fan campaign, Shore revealed a teaser for a short film, starring himself as Richard Simmons titled &quot;The Court Jester&quot;. Simmons released a statement revealing that he did not give permission for the short.

<text>StoryServer was the name the company Vignette gave to CNET&#x27;s web publishing application &quot;PRISM&quot; when they bought it. It used a document publishing model to move templates through various workflow stages, and was thus quite useful to the newly formed Web publishing world.

The templates were defined in the Tcl language, using extensions that made StoryServer&#x27;s internal state and database available.

The defining attribute of StoryServer was the caching system which allowed access to pre-generated pages to completely bypass the content generation system, and thus produce these pages as fast as the underlying hardware and Web server software could send them to the network. This gained StoryServer a degree of scalability that most products were incapable of matching. It integrated with HTTP web server platforms and used lazy caching gracefully connected to their 404 &quot;File Not Found&quot; handlers.

StoryServer version 4 was released in July 1998 and introduced XML support. After StoryServer 4, Vignette changed the name of the product to &quot;V5&quot;, and has named each subsequent version in the same manner. V5 and V6 added support for templates that used Java and ASP rather than tcl.

StoryServer-based websites often use a distinctive page address style in which the filename consists of several numbers separated by commas. An example URL of this form would be &#x27;http://example.com/foo/0,1245,00.html&#x27;.

<text>Rhapsody Rabbit is a 1946 American animated comedy short film in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series, directed by Friz Freleng and featuring Bugs Bunny. The movie was originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. Pictures on November 9, 1946. This short is a follow-up of sorts to Freleng&#x27;s 1941 Academy Award-nominated &quot;Rhapsody in Rivets&quot;, which featured the &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot; by Franz Liszt. The &quot;instrument&quot; used to perform the &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot; in &quot;Rhapsody in Rivets&quot; is a skyscraper under construction, while this short features Bugs playing the piece at a piano while being pestered by a mouse.

In 1946, film critic James Agee wrote in &quot;The Nation&quot; that the short is &quot;the funniest thing I have seen since the decline of sociological dancing,&quot; saying, &quot;The best of it goes two ways: one, very observant parody of concert-pianistic affectations, elegantly thought out and synchronized; the other, brutality keyed into the spirit of the music to reach greater subtlety than I have ever seen brutality reach before.&quot;

&quot;Rhapsody Rabbit&quot; was the first cartoon to be broadcast on Cartoon Network when the channel launched on October 1, 1992.

==Plot==
Set against a backdrop of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried&quot; funeral march, Bugs Bunny takes center stage as a piano virtuoso. Amidst thunderous applause, Bugs embarks on a performance of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot;.

The opening scene sees Bugs poised at the piano, only to be interrupted by a persistent cough from an unseen audience member. Unfazed, Bugs resorts to unconventional means to silence the disturbance, humorously wielding a revolver from his tailcoat.

Throughout the performance, Bugs engages in playful banter, responding to a ringing phone inside the piano with his trademark catchphrase, &quot;Eh, what&#x27;s up, doc?&quot; He cleverly incorporates musical references, such as singing &quot;Fi-ga-ro!&quot; during a familiar three-note sequence, adding a comedic twist to his piano playing.

As Bugs navigates through the piece, he encounters a pesky mouse that becomes a persistent nuisance. The encounter escalates into a musical duel, culminating in a boogie-woogie showdown. Despite momentarily trapping the mouse, Bugs is ultimately outwitted as the mouse reemerges, performing a surprise finale on a miniature piano.

In a comedic climax, Bugs confronts the final frenzied pages of the Rhapsody, culminating in exasperation as the mouse steals the spotlight with its unexpected performance. Frustrated yet undeterred, Bugs delivers the closing notes with characteristic wit, concluding the performance with a humorous flourish.

==Voice cast==
* Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Rat and Coughing Audience Member

==Home media==
The short is available on &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2&quot;, with an optional commentary track by musical historian Daniel Goldmark. It is also available on volume 2 of &quot;Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection&quot;, as well as Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s two video streaming services, the Boomerang SVOD app and Max.

==Plagiarism dispute==
One year after the release of &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit,&quot; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio (MGM) produced a comparable animated short titled &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot;, featuring Tom and Jerry series. This production portrays Tom encountering distractions caused by Jerry, the mouse, during a piano concert performance. Noteworthy similarities between the two works include the replication of several comedic sequences and the utilization of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot; as their primary musical composition. &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; received recognition by winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

Following the presentation of both films at the 19th Academy Awards Ceremony, allegations of plagiarism arose from both MGM and Warner Bros. studios. Technicolor was accused of sending a print of either cartoon to a competing studio, who then plagiarized their rival&#x27;s work. Despite attempts to address the matter, uncertainties persist regarding the origins of the similarities. While &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit&quot; holds an earlier Motion Picture Association approval number and release date, MGM&#x27;s production timelines extended over a longer duration. Additionally, the substantial resemblances between the two animations may also be attributed to mere coincidence.

The controversy surrounding these productions received further examination in an episode of the Cartoon Network anthology series &quot;ToonHeads&quot;, providing a platform for discussion and analysis of the issue.

<text>Adlai E. Stevenson College, known colloquially as Stevenson College, is a residential college at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Currently, the college is host to the Linguistics Department, as well as many humanities faculty.

The college was named after Adlai Stevenson, an American politician and United Nations ambassador. The college was founded in 1966, a year after the establishment of the university and its first college, Cowell.

== Core course ==
The core course at Stevenson College is Self &amp; Society. It is the only two-quarter long core course at the university and students can earn up to five general education requirements.

The course holds an emphasis on analytical writing, critical thinking, and oral presentation skills. Due to the broad nature of the course, students find themselves learning about and discussing religion, political theory, social criticism, and literature. Some texts that the course includes are the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, Plato’s Five Dialogues, &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, Sigmund Freud&#x27;s Society and Its Discontents, Sartre&#x27;s Existentialism is a Humanism, The Communist Manifesto, Persepolis_(comics), and much more. Students enjoy the small seminar sections, to discuss many ideas relating to “self” and “society.”

== Living at Stevenson ==

At Stevenson College, there are eight dormitory houses that are separated into two adjacent locations: “upper quad” and “lower quad.” Each house contains single, double, triple, and quad rooms, and can house approximately 60 students. Stevenson College also has apartments that are an option for non-freshman undergraduate students. They house approximately 136 students, and come fully furnished.

The knoll, which has views of Monterey Bay, is a common hangout for Stevenson students, with students studying, napping, and sun bathing on the knoll throughout the year.

The Stevenson Coffee House is also a hangout where students and professors eat, socialize, and study. The Stevenson Library is a quieter location to work on papers and assignments.

Stevenson College is located above the university’s gym and pool.

== Community at Stevenson ==

Stevenson College also holds events for its community. College Night happens two to three times a quarter, where students eat specially themed meals with some type of live entertainment. Open Mic Nights at the Stevenson Coffee House are also an event that occurs several times a month. Anybody can sign up, and some students perform songs, recite poetry, or perform magic tricks. The Resident Assistants (RAs) at Stevenson College also host events each quarter.

<text>Radola Gajda, born as Rudolf Geidl (14 February 1892 – 15 April 1948) was a Czech military commander and politician.

==Early years==
Geidl&#x27;s father was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army based in Kotor. His mother was a poor Montenegrin noblewoman. Later, the family moved to Kyjov, Moravia, where Geidl studied at a secondary grammar school. In 1910 he went through one year of compulsory military service in Mostar. Afterwards Geidl left for the Balkans and likely took part in the Balkan Wars (1912–13). At the start of World War I he re-joined the Austro-Hungarian Army and served in Dalmatia and Sarajevo. In September 1915 he was taken prisoner in Višegrad, Bosnia.

==Legions==
Immediately after his capture, Geidl switched sides and was commissioned as a captain in the Montenegrin Army. Having some experience as an apothecary, he pretended to be a physician. Following the collapse of the Montenegrin Army in 1916, Gajda escaped into Russia where he joined a Serbian battalion as a physician.

At the end of 1916 the battalion was destroyed and Gajda joined the Czechoslovak Legions (30 January 1917) as a staff captain. Gajda proved himself as an able commander in the Battle of Zborov and quickly rose through the military hierarchy.

During the evacuation of the Legion in May 1918 via the Trans-Siberian railway violence erupted between the Legion and the Bolsheviks. Czechoslovak soldiers quickly occupied large tracts of the railway east of the Volga. Gajda commanded the area from Novonikolayevsk (Novosibirsk) north to Irkutsk. Aggressive tactics, sometimes against the orders of his superiors, helped to defeat the Bolshevik forces and connect all units of the Legion. This contributed to his conflict with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, who wanted the Legions to stay neutral in the Russian Civil War.

After the capture of Yekaterinburg by the Legion and the White Army in July 1918, he set up his headquarters in the city, establishing his office at the Ipatiev House, incidentally where the imprisoned Romanovs had been murdered by the Bolsheviks less than a week prior to the capture of the city. The most successful operation was the capture of Perm (24 December 1918) where the Legion took 20,000 prisoners and seized 5,000 railway cars, 60 cannon, 1,000 machine guns and the fleet frozen in the Kama River. Gajda enjoyed widespread popularity amongst his troops and throughout the White movement. He was promoted to Major-General and nicknamed &quot;the Siberian Ataman&quot; and &quot;the Siberian Tiger.&quot; He later accepted an invitation from Aleksandr Kolchak to become a commander in his army.

His career with Kolchak was less successful—the Red Army had begun to take the initiative while Kolchak&#x27;s forces dwindled away. Gajda, out of Kolchak&#x27;s favor, was dismissed on 5 July 1919. After involving himself in the unsuccessful mutiny of Esers against Kolchak (17 November 1919) he escaped from Siberia and sailed to Europe.

==Military career in Czechoslovakia==

After arriving in Czechoslovakia in early 1920, Gajda was given a pension and the rank of General, but was not assigned a command. In November 1920 he was sent to study military theory at the &quot;École supérieure de guerre&quot; in France. He also studied agriculture at the &quot;Institut Technique de Pratique Agricole&quot;.

Gajda returned two years later. On 9 October 1922, he was given command of the 11th Division in Košice, Slovakia. His involvement in the cultural life of the region soon endeared him to the locals. On 1 December 1924 he was named Deputy Chief of the General Staff in Prague under General Eugène Mittelhauser, head of French military mission in Czechoslovakia. Gajda became a rival of Mittelhauser and Mittelhauser&#x27;s predecessor Maurice Pellé. In this capacity, Gajda worked successfully to limit the influence of the mission, which was brought to an end in 1926. On 20 March 1926 he became Acting Chief of the General Staff. In his position he backed up former legionnaires against former loyalist Austrian officers.

Under pressure from president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk Gajda was forced to retire, because he had publicly shown himself sympathetic to Italian fascism. Combined with envy, political intrigue and fear of a military coup (similar to the contemporary May Coup in Poland) this led to the dismissal of the ambitious general.

==Politics==

Still a young man of 34, Gajda decided to turn to politics. At the end of 1926 he took part in the founding of the National Fascist Community (), modeled on Benito Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party and became its leader on 2 January 1927. In 1929 the party took several seats in parliament. In 1931 Gajda was briefly imprisoned and stripped of military rank due to a prior scandal.

During the night of 21–22 January 1933, the Židenice Mutiny broke out in Brno. This was an attempt on the part of 70 to 80 local fascists to overthrow the government by means of a military coup. The mutiny was immediately suppressed. Gajda was arrested the next day and charged with inciting the coup. Initially he was absolved of wrongdoing but after political pressure the verdict was revised. Gajda was sentenced to six months in prison and the forfeiture of his military pension.
The NOF was somewhat successful in the 1935 elections and Gajda obtained a seat in parliament, which he was to hold until 1939. At this time, the NOF had a strong anti-German orientation, supported a military buildup and favored war with Nazi Germany over the Sudetenland. (After the Munich Agreement Gajda, as a gesture of defiance, returned all French and British honors and medals.) In 1939 he was rehabilitated and restored to the rank of General. He also became active in the newly established Party of National Unity ().

During March 1939, the Czechoslovakian political scene was in state of turmoil. Several coups were attempted, one in anticipation of making Gajda the new head of state. These amateurish coups ended in fiasco and several days later the remaining Czech lands were occupied by Nazi Germany.

Gajda was marginalized during the occupation and abandoned politics. He occasionally assisted the Czech resistance by helping army officers to flee into Poland and by hiding the resistance activities of his son. He was investigated by the Gestapo but avoided imprisonment. When World War II ended Gajda was imprisoned (12 May 1945) and tortured. He practically lost his eyesight while jailed.

==Last years==
In April 1947 he was brought to trial for &quot;propagation of Fascism and Nazism&quot;, for which the prosecutor requested a life sentence. Gajda&#x27;s guilt was far from clear and the resulting sentence of two years allowed him to leave prison shortly thereafter. Penniless and forgotten, he died several months later.

<text>Anton Zwengauer (11 October 1810 – 13 June 1884) was a German painter of the Biedermeier period.

==Life==
Zwengauer was born in Munich, Bavaria. He studied at the Academy of Art in his home town under, among others, Peter von Cornelius. Zwengauer found himself attracted to landscape painting, in which there was no formal training at the Academy, and at the age of 17 he therefore began to travel through the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, returning from each trip with large quantities of sketches and watercolours. His artistic breakthrough came with his painting &quot;Sonnenuntergang im Dachauer Moos&quot; (&quot;Sunset in the Dachauer Moos&quot;), which immediately became well-known and much-discussed in the Munich art world. His sunsets became so well known that all paintings with sunsets were referred to, half admiringly and half ironically, as &quot;Zwengauers&quot;.

In 1835 Maximilian II, King of Bavaria, appointed him conservator of the picture gallery of Schloss Schleissheim and in 1869 promoted him to the same post in the royal picture gallery, the later Alte Pinakothek.

In the selection of his motifs Zwengauer always tried to represent the inherent strength and peace of natural landscapes in an almost solemn mood. He often painted sunsets, in which he aimed to achieve impressive effects of light and colour by simple means.

Zwengauer died aged 73 on 13 June 1884 in Munich and is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof. A street in Solln in south Munich - Zwengauerweg - is named after him.

The landscape painter Anton Georg Zwengauer was his son, the Bavarian Lieutenant-General Karl Zwengauer his grandson.

<text>K42 is a discontinued open-source research operating system (OS) for cache-coherent 64-bit multiprocessor systems. It was developed primarily at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in collaboration with the University of Toronto and University of New Mexico. The main focus of this OS is to address performance and scalability issues of system software on large-scale, shared memory, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessing computers.

K42 uses a microkernel architecture rather than the traditional monolithic kernel design. K42 consists of a small exception-handling component that serves as the microkernel, a fast inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism named protected procedure call (PPC), and servers for most other components of the operating system. These servers exist in separate address spaces and rely upon the fast IPC mechanism for communication with the microkernel and other servers.

==History==
The core of K42 is based on the University of Toronto&#x27;s operating system &quot;Tornado&quot;. K42 is the university&#x27;s third generation of research on scalable operating systems. Tornado OS on a nuMachine Multiprocessor was the second generation and &quot;Hurricane OS&quot; on a &quot;Hector Multiprocessor&quot; was the first generation.

==Features==
K42 supports the Linux PowerPC 64 and 32 application binary interfaces (ABIs), so most PowerPC Linux binary files can run on K42 without modification, including the relational database DB2. K42 has some device drivers implemented specifically for it, but it gets most of its hardware support by directly linking in Linux device drivers to a special server.

Another goal of the K42 design is to achieve a customizable and maintainable system. Being built with an object-oriented programming design, it allows applications to customize and thus optimize the OS services required, and then on the fly, hot swap kernel object implementations. This is particularly important for applications, such as databases and web servers, where the ability to control physical resources can improve performance.

==Open source==
The K42 source is via git:

<text>The Bay Area Ridge Trail (shortened as Ridge Trail) is a planned multi-use trail along the hill and mountain ridgelines surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area, in Northern California. , have been established. When complete, the trail will connect over seventy-five parks and open spaces. The trail is being designed to provide access for hikers, runners, mountain bicyclists, and equestrians. It will be accessible through trailheads near major population centers, but the trail will extend into more remote areas. The first trail section was dedicated on May 13, 1989.

==History==
William Penn Mott Jr., the twelfth director of the National Park Service, gave a speech in March 1987 at a state parks and recreation conference and discussed plans for the Ridge Trail. While working for the East Bay Regional Park District in the 1960s, Mott&#x27;s office was on a ridgeline in the East Bay, and the views from the office inspired his vision of a hill-and-ridge trail encircling the Bay and linking its communities. The plan would later attract bipartisan support, with George Miller joining Mott.

In May 1987, the Greenbelt Alliance held a meeting to strategize how to approach the San Francisco Water Department and convince them to open their watershed lands to the public; Mark Evanoff convened the meeting and Brian O&#x27;Neill, Superintendent of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, proposed a potential strategy to pursue the goals outlined in the report by the President&#x27;s Commission on Americans Outdoors. Later that year, a planning committee was formed with memberships from nearly forty public agencies, recreation groups, and individuals. Eventually, this committee became the Bay Area Ridge Trail Council.

Dinesh Desai, a retired engineer, and Bob Cowell, a retired fire chief, completed the first hike of the Ridge Trail in 1999. The pair followed designated and non-designated trails, including a crossing of the Carquinez Strait by kayak.

===Trail development===

The first two segments of the trail, dedicated on May 13, 1989, were located in San Mateo County and managed by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District and the San Mateo County Department of Parks. Marin County and San Francisco City and County opened their first segments in September 1989; Napa, Solano, and Santa Clara counties in October 1989; Contra Costa and Alameda counties in June 1990; and Sonoma County in October 1990. Existing trails in public spaces were incorporated into the Ridge Trail, extending the trail to by 1990 and by 1995.

By 1999, of the Ridge Trail had been completed, mostly on public lands. of the Ridge Trail were added in 2005, including a new bridge over San Geronimo Creek; at that point, the Ridge Trail ran for . The section of Ridge Trail through Crockett Hills Regional Park in Contra Costa County, which opened in June 2006, pushed the trail past the mark.

, the Ridge Trail stood at completed. The section of the trail that runs through San Francisco has been completed, and parts of the San Francisco trail have been rerouted to pass through more green space and over the Twin Peaks. Large sections of the trail running through San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa, and Alameda counties have been completed. Much of the remaining mileage is on private property in Santa Clara, Sonoma, and Napa.

==Route==
Starting at the Golden Gate Bridge and proceeding clockwise, the route goes through every Bay Area county: Marin, Sonoma, Napa, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Mateo, and San Francisco. The planned alignment of the Ridge Trail extends as far north as Calistoga and Angwin, and as far south as Gilroy.

===San Francisco City and County===
From south to north, the trail passes through the following landmarks: Lake Merced, Stern Grove, Twin Peaks, Buena Vista Park, the panhandle of Golden Gate Park, and the Presidio.
==Bay Area Ridge Trail Council==
The Bay Area Ridge Trail Council (BARTC), founded in 1987, is the organization building, maintaining, and promoting the Ridge Trail. BARTC initially was supported by the Greenbelt Alliance, but it was incorporated in 1991 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit under co-chairs Brian O&#x27;Neill and Marcia McNally. The Council office is located in Berkeley.

<text>The Hôpital d&#x27;instruction des armées Percy or &quot;HIA Percy&quot; (meaning &quot;Percy Training Hospital of the Armies&quot;) is a military hospital in Clamart, near Paris, France. It is managed by the &quot;Service de santé des armées&quot; (French Defence Health service) and provides health services to both military and civilian patients. It is named after Pierre-François Percy, military surgeon during the Napoleonic wars.

The hospital has, in particular, an emergency service, a service for treating severe burns, and a service for treating patients contaminated by radioactivity (including a hematological service).

==Notable patients==
The hospital has treated several heads of state and other notable individuals.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was treated at Percy hospital from October 29, 2004, until his death on November 11, 2004. During his stay at Percy, he had fallen into an increasingly deeper coma despite intensive care.

Bassel Fleihan, a Lebanese legislator and Minister of Economy and Commerce was treated at Percy, having suffered major burns on 95% of his body when a massive bomb exploded on the Beirut seafront as he passed by in former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri&#x27;s motorcade on February 14, 2005. Despite being seated beside Hariri, who was killed when the explosion occurred, Fleihan lived through the attack and was airlifted to Percy where he survived for 64 days before succumbing to his injuries.

Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa was admitted to hospital 1 July 2008 to receive treatment following a stroke he suffered on 29 June. He died in hospital on 19 August 2008.

<doc id="1157077" wikidata="Q2653744" url="?curid=1157077" title="Pereyaslavets">
<text>Pereyaslavets (East Slavic: ) or Preslavets () was a trade city located near mouths of the Danube. The city&#x27;s name is derived from that of the Bulgarian capital of the time, Preslav, and means Little Preslav (). In Greek it was also known as Presthlavitza (). Several theories exist regarding the exact location of the city: either at Preslav or in its vicinity in Bulgaria, or at Isaccea, Nufăru, Murighiol or Jurilovca in Romania.

A thriving trade centre of the First Bulgarian Empire, it was captured by Prince Svyatoslav of Kievan Rus in 968 (See Sviatoslav&#x27;s invasion of Bulgaria). During Svyatoslav&#x27;s absence from the city following the Siege of Kiev (968), part of the citizens revolted and opened the gate to Bulgarian forces. According to Vasily Tatischev, Svyatoslav&#x27;s governor Volk managed to escape.

Upon his return to Bulgaria, Svyatoslav promptly suppressed the rebellion and, to the chagrin of his mother and relatives, transferred the capital from Kiev to Pereyaslavets. According to the Primary Chronicle (its record for year 969), Svyatoslav explained to his courtiers that it was to Pereyaslavets, the centre of his lands, that &quot;all the riches would flow: gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from Greece, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, and from Ruthenia furs, wax, honey, and ancient laws&quot;. Two years later, the town fell to the Byzantines, who had launched their own invasion of Bulgaria, and became the seat of a Byzantine &quot;strategos&quot;.

Excavations have identified a late 10th century Byzantine fortress at the village of Nufăru, Romania (known as Prislav until 1968), on the Sfântu Gheorghe branch of the Danube, just 11 km east of Tulcea, which may indicate it was the location of the Presthlavitza mentioned in Byzantine source.

<doc id="1157079" wikidata="Q173094" url="?curid=1157079" title="Mika Salo">
<text>Mika Juhani Salo (born 30 November 1966) is a Finnish former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . 

His best ranking was 10th in the world championship in 1999, when he stood in for the injured Michael Schumacher at Ferrari for six races, scoring two podiums and contributing to Ferrari&#x27;s constructors&#x27; championship win. He also won the GT2 class in the 2008 and 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Career==

===Formula Three and Japanese racing===
In 1989, Helsinki-born Salo competed in the British Formula 3 Championship, racing for Alan Docking Racing. He raced with the Reynard Alfa Romeo package which was not the season&#x27;s best. Staying with Alan Docking Racing for 1990 and moving to a more competitive Ralt chassis, he raced against countryman and fierce rival Mika Häkkinen in Formula Three, finishing second to him.
In 1990, Salo was caught driving under the influence in London.

===Formula One===

====1994–1998: Lotus, Tyrrell and Arrows====
After a few years racing in Japan he made his first Formula One start at the penultimate round of the season in Japan for the ailing Lotus team. He was kept on for the season&#x27;s finale in Australia. Following the collapse of Lotus following the end of the season, Salo moved to Tyrrell for . He was to spend three years with the team, scoring points several times. In the 1997 Monaco Grand Prix he completed the whole (rain-shortened and -slowed) race without refuelling, taking fifth place ahead of the faster Giancarlo Fisichella as a result. Despite a promising with Arrows, he had no full-time drive in .

====1999: British American Racing and Ferrari====

Following an injury to BAR driver Ricardo Zonta, Salo took his place for three races whilst the Brazilian recovered. BAR&#x27;s first season was not successful but Salo scored their best result of the year, with a seventh-place finish at San Marino. However a greater opportunity arose when Michael Schumacher broke his leg in a crash during the 1999 British Grand Prix. Salo was selected as his substitute to partner Eddie Irvine at Ferrari. In his second race in Ferrari at the 1999 German Grand Prix Salo led for part of the race and would have scored a Grand Prix win but team orders demanded that he give the lead to Irvine, who at the time was fighting for the championship with Mika Häkkinen. Following the race, Irvine handed his victory trophy over to Salo as a gesture of gratitude. He also finished third at Monza, ahead of Irvine. These podium finishes were critical in helping Ferrari win their first Constructors&#x27; title since .

====2000–2002: Sauber and Toyota==== 

Salo was back full-time in with Sauber, taking 11th in the championship, although he left the team at the end of the season to join the new Toyota team in preparation for its Formula One entry in , and also cited a desire to score podiums rather than lower points-scoring positions. He scored two points for Toyota in their first season, becoming the first driver since JJ Lehto at the 1993 South African Grand Prix to score points on a team&#x27;s debut by finishing sixth at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix. He retired from Formula One at the end of 2002, after getting fired from Toyota. Though the news was initially met with general surprise, it was later revealed that Salo was not on good terms with the team, who heavily criticized his deemed poor performance.

During his Formula One career, he achieved two podiums, and scored a total of 33 championship points.

===Post-Formula One===
His first post-Formula One race came at the 2003 12 Hours of Sebring, driving the UK-entered Audi R8, the same car he was due to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans if it had not run out of fuel already after the first hour. He raced in four CART races for PK Racing during the same year, his best finish being third in Miami in his second series start.

Because of his strong links with Ferrari he was picked up to be part of the development program of the Maserati MC12 GT racer. He made his FIA GT debut in 2004, narrowly losing the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in a Ferrari 575. After that he entered the last four races of the season in the Maserati, winning two races and finishing second once.

2005 was a year somewhat lost in the doldrums with only two participations with the Maserati MC12 in the ALMS GTS-class, a competition where the car turned out to be not even half as competitive as in the FIA GT series.

For 2006, Salo returned to racing full-time, signing with AF Corse in the FIA GT to drive the Ferrari F430 and later on in the year with Risi Competizione in the ALMS. He was victorious in class in the 24 Hours of Spa and finished third in the FIA GT2 Drivers&#x27; Championship with 61 points, while his efforts in the ALMS contributed to Risi&#x27;s Teams&#x27; Championship cup.
In the following year he continued with Risi Competizione in the ALMS and took the GT2 class honours in the 12 Hours of Sebring and the championship along with teammate Jaime Melo. They won a total of eight races out of twelve in the class. In addition, he won the RAC Tourist Trophy with Thomas Biagi when substituting for Michael Bartels, driving a Maserati MC12 once more.

Salo and Melo with Risi Competizione earned the first team At-Large honours on the 2007 All-American Racing Team, as voted for by the American Auto Racing Writers and Broadcasters (AARWBA).
Salo raced again in the ALMS for Risi Competizione in 2008. Although he was not successful in defending his previous year&#x27;s titles, he won the GT2 class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, coming in 18th overall.

In 2009, he joined the Risi Ferrari team at the blue-riband races only, the 12 Hours of Sebring, the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Petit Le Mans event, winning all three of them. Having won these enduro races all more than once, Salo felt he was ready for a new challenge. He set his mind on NASCAR, and had his first test with Michael Waltrip Racing at the half-mile New Smyrna Speedway in November 2009.

In 2010–12, Salo competed in the Gold Coast 600, an endurance event for the V8 Supercars. In 2010, he partnered with Walkinshaw Racing&#x27;s Andrew Thompson and retired from both races. For 2011–12 he raced with Will Davison and the Ford Performance Racing team, finishing 2nd in the 1st race of 2011 and winning the 2nd race in 2012.

In 2014, driving for Maranello Motorsport, Salo co-drove a Ferrari 458 Italia GT3 to victory at the Bathurst 12 Hour alongside Australian motor racing legends Craig Lowndes and John Bowe, and another local Australian driver Peter Edwards.

==Personal life==
Salo lives in Estonia, and has a son and a daughter with his wife Noriko Endo, who he married in July 1999. His godson Jesse Krohn competes in the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Like fellow Finns Keke Rosberg and JJ Lehto, both former Formula One drivers, Salo has commentated on several F1 races on MTV3 and the pay-channel C More MAX since 2005. Since 2011, Salo has been hosting the Finnish TV-show, Virittäjät (&#x27;Test Drive by Mika Salo&#x27;), along with his former co-host Tomi Tuominen, who is a Finnish journalist, television presenter, sports commentator and former co-driver in the World Rally Championship.

In 2013, Salo featured in Discovery channel&#x27;s program called &quot;Driven to Extremes&quot; along with Hollywood actors Tom Hardy and Adrien Brody. Salo appeared in two episodes, one with Tom Hardy in minus 50 degrees Celsius in Russia, and the other one with Adrien Brody to the Malaysian jungle at the height of the monsoon season.

==Helmet==
Salo&#x27;s helmet was originally dark blue with a white halo on the top (with a red line inside), two white stripes (with a red line inside) going from the rear going down diagonally to the sides of the helmet and a white trapezoidal shape on the chin area (with blue outline), slightly based on Prost&#x27;s helmet. When he raced in Formula One, he changed the helmet from dark blue to sky blue with the rest of the elements intact.

<text>Martin Wiberg (4 September 1826 – 29 December 1905) was a Swedish inventor. He enrolled at Lund University in 1845 and became a Doctor of Philosophy in 1850.

He is known as a computer pioneer for his c. 1859 (1857-1860) invention of a machine the size of a sewing machine that could print logarithmic tables (first interest tables appeared in 1860, logarithmic in 1875). The logarithmic tables were subsequently published in English, French and German in 1876. The device was investigated by the French academy of science which also wrote an extensive report on it in 1863. The device was inspired by the similar work done by Per Georg Scheutz (had the same capacity: 15-digit numbers and fourth-order differences) and has similarities with Charles Babbage&#x27;s difference engine. (Scheutz machine was based on the difference engine). The device is preserved at Tekniska museet (The Technical Museum) of Sweden in Stockholm. Wiberg failed to sell his machine, and also failed to sell the output tables due to their bad looks.

Apart from this invention, Wiberg invented numerous other devices and gadgets, among these a cream separator and a pulse jet engine. None of these were commercially successful.

<text>Tengizchevroil is a joint venture between Chevron (50% share in the consortium), ExxonMobil (25% share), KazMunayGas (20% share) and LukArco (5% share). The joint venture was formed in April 1993, when the government of Kazakhstan granted exclusive 40-year rights to Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) to develop the Tengiz and Korolevskoye oil fields located in the north-eastern reaches of the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan.

== History and operations ==

From a two-company joint venture in 1993 (between the Kazakhstani state oil company KazakhOil, now KazMunayGas, and the American oil giant Chevron) Tengizchevroil expanded in 1996–1997 into a four-company consortium: ExxonMobil Kazakhstan Ventures, an ExxonMobil subsidiary, and LukArco, a joint venture between Lukoil and Atlantic Richfield (ARCO), acquired 25% and 5% respectively. In 2000, BP became involved in the business, as BP had merged with Arco and took a 46% share in LukArco. In December 2009, BP sold its stake to Lukoil and thereafter Lukoil became the sole shareholder of LukArco.

In January 2014, the firm reported a record rise in output to 27.1 million tonnes from 24.2 million tonnes. 

In mid-2019, BP expressed interest in returning to Kazakhstan. The company signed a memorandum of understanding with KazMunayGas. In 2020, the companies signed an agreement establishing a partnership to explore for hydrocarbons in Kazakhstan. In 2019, its production volume reached 30 million tons. The company employs 4,000 people, about 95% of which are residents of Kazakhstan.

<doc id="1157087" wikidata="Q520417" url="?curid=1157087" title="Jacques-Alain Miller">
<text>Jacques-Alain Miller (; born 14 February 1944) is a psychoanalyst and writer. He is one of the founding members of the École de la Cause freudienne (School of the Freudian Cause) and the World Association of Psychoanalysis which he presided from 1992 to 2002. He is the sole editor of the books of The Seminars of Jacques Lacan.

==Life and career==

===1960s===
In 1962, Miller entered the École Normale Supérieure where he studied with Louis Althusser. His fellow students included: Étienne Balibar, Pierre Macherey, François Regnault, Robert Linart and Jean-Claude Milner. At the ENS he attended the seminars of Roland Barthes, the &quot;first writer with whom I had a close friendship&quot;. At this time he also met the young Derrida who was lecturing at the Sorbonne.

In 1963, Althusser assigned Miller the task of reading &quot;all of Lacan&quot;. The following year, Jacques Lacan was appointed lecturer at the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes and transferred his Seminar to the ENS. Over the summer break of 1964, Lacan invited Miller to his country house, La Prévôté in Guitrancourt, where Miller read the transcriptions of Lacan&#x27;s early seminars. During a later stay at Guitrancourt, Miller began a relationship with Judith Lacan, Lacan&#x27;s daughter, whom he married in 1966. The index of concepts and the commentary on the graphs in Lacan&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Écrits&quot; were drawn up by Miller, and in that same year, he founded &quot;Cahiers pour l&#x27;Analyse&quot;, a seminal publication whose editorial board included Alain Grosrichard, Regnault, Milner and, later, Alain Badiou.

Miller&#x27;s written texts from this early period are published in the Gallimard collection, &quot;Un début dans la vie&quot; (2002) which includes his interview with Sartre and the influential text presented at Lacan&#x27;s Seminar (24 February 1965), &quot;Suture: Elements of the Logic of the Signifier&quot;.

===1970s===
After a period of involvement in the left-wing movements associated with May 1968, Miller was encouraged by Lacan to take &quot;another path by which to get your privileged revolt across: mine for example&quot;. In time Miller would become instrumental in Lacan&#x27;s École Freudienne de Paris, founding and editing the journal &quot;Ornicar ?&quot; which published lessons of Lacan&#x27;s Seminar. When Lacan moved to the University of Vincennes—the Department of Psychoanalysis was renamed &quot;Le Champ freudien&quot;—Lacan became its director, and Michel Foucault appointed Jacques-Alain Miller president.

Miller&#x27;s teaching from this period (1972-1978) took on the name &quot;L&#x27;Orientation lacanienne&quot; and gave rise to published texts on Bentham, Peirce and Church.

In 1973, Miller transcribed Lacan&#x27;s the 1964 Seminar on &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot; which was to lead to a lifelong commitment to establishing the full series of Lacan&#x27;s annual Parisian Seminar. &quot;Book XI&quot; was published by Seuil in 1973, with &quot;Books I&quot; &amp; &quot;Book XX&quot; following in 1975 and &quot;Book II&quot; in 1978.

Miller also contributed in 1973 to the two-part televised programme that later became known as &quot;Television&quot;.

===1980s===
Lacan&#x27;s dissolution of the EFP in 1980 was followed by the creation of La cause freudienne. Soon thereafter Lacan died, leaving Miller as the sole editor of his seminars.

Miller resumed his weekly seminars in 1980, thus opening the series known as &quot;L&#x27;Orientation lacanienne II&quot;. Dedicated to expounding and elucidating Lacan&#x27;s work, Miller&#x27;s course was attended by many influential figures in psychoanalytic theory, notably Éric Laurent and Slavoj Zizek. The Lacanian Orientation course went under the banner of a &quot;return to the clinic&quot; and early themes included &quot;From the Symptom to the Fantasy&quot; (1982-3), &quot;The Differential Clinic of Psychoses&quot; (1987-8 DEA seminar), and &quot;Traits of Perversion&quot; (1988-9).

The 1980s were also a period of travel in Europe and Latin America to consolidate the emerging communities of Lacan&#x27;s students and adherents, culminating in the founding of the European School of Psychoanalysis in 1990 (now the European Federation of the Schools of the WAP) and the Argentine Escuela de la Orientación Lacaniana in 1992.

Over this decade, Miller established &quot;Book III&quot; and &quot;Book VII&quot; of Lacan&#x27;s Seminar. Miller&#x27;s 1980s lectures in Buenos Aires are collected in Tome I of &quot;Conferencias Porteñas&quot; (Paidos, 2010).

===1990s===
In the early nineties, Miller&#x27;s work began to be translated into English and published in the United States through the &quot;Newsletter of the Freudian Field&quot; and the New York-based cultural journal &quot;Lacanian Ink&quot; under the editorship of Josefina Ayerza.

In 1992, Miller launched the World Association of Psychoanalysis which grouped together the École de la Cause freudienne, the European School of Psychoanalysis, and the Escuela de la Orientación Lacaniana, and soon thereafter oversaw the creation of Schools in Brazil, Spain and Italy which were likewise included in the WAP.

The end of the decade saw a &quot;thaw&quot; in relations with the IPA thanks to the efforts of its then President Horacio Etchegoyen. Miller was invited to attend the 1997 IPA Congress in Barcelona where his remarks from the floor were greeted with warm applause.

In 1995, Miller&#x27;s weekly course moved to the Paul-Painlevé Amphitheatre at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, where it would continue until his retirement from University Paris-VIII in 2009. In 1998, his teaching entered its third phase as &quot;L&#x27;Orientation lacanienne III&quot;. The Buenos Aires lectures of the 1989-1996 period are collected in Tome II of &quot;Conferencias Porteñas&quot; (Paidos, 2009). The nineteen nineties also saw the publication of &quot;Book IV&quot;, &quot;Book V&quot; and &quot;Book XVII&quot; of Lacan&#x27;s Seminar, established by Miller.

===2000s===
After two decades devoted exclusively to training analysts and furthering worldwide institutional links, alongside the ongoing transcription of Lacan’s Seminar, 2001 saw a return to the public stage Miller had occupied in the late sixties. In June 2001, the journal of the SPP published an article that on Miller and the École de la Cause freudienne to which Miller objected. He stated his case, publishing a first letter on 3 September 2001. Its enthusiastic reception by France’s intellectual community gave rise to five further letters which look in detail at the issues surrounding Lacan’s 1963 &quot;excommunication&quot; from the IPA and the history of the psychoanalytic movement over the four ensuing decades. The third letter, penned in the wake of the September 11 attacks, also offers a reflection on terrorism and political action.

In 2003, Miller founded the New Lacanian School, which groups together the societies from the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, Israel, and Greece along with affiliated groups from Ireland and Eastern Europe. In the same year he published the satirical &quot;Neveu de Lacan&quot; (Verdier) in response to the 2002 pamphlet by Daniel Lindenberg, &quot;Le Rappel à l’ordre&quot;.

In October 2003, the French government passed a bill intended to regulate, for the first time, the practice of psychotherapy in France. Miller raised issues with this in another letter, published on 17 November, addressed to the UMP politician Bernard Accoyer. Over the following months, Miller spearheaded the movement dedicated to increasing both public and professional awareness of the issues at stake, prompting Bernard-Henri Lévy to write: &quot;Sometimes history hangs on a thread. It is quite likely that in this affair the thread bears the name of this one man: Jacques-Alain Miller&quot;.

The transcription of Lacan’s Seminar continued, with &quot;Book VIII&quot; (Second Edition), &quot;Book X&quot;, &quot;Book XXIII&quot;, &quot;Book XVI&quot; and &quot;Book XVIII&quot; all appearing in this decade. In 2008, at the time of the sixth WAP Congress, Miller delivered a lecture before a 1,700 strong audience at the Teatro Coliseo. This lecture is transcribed alongside his 1996-2001 Argentine lectures collected in Tome III of &quot;Conferencias Porteñas&quot; (Paidos, 2010). At this time, he also became a regular guest-contributor to France Culture radio and French news magazines such as &quot;Marianne&quot; and &quot;Le Point&quot;. A selection of his public articles was collected as &quot;Le secret des dieux&quot; (2005) and in 2008, he took part in the “Rally of the Impossible Professions” in London, speaking alongside Richard Gombrich and Michael Power. In 2009, he founded &quot;Hurly-Burly&quot;, the International Lacanian Journal of Psychoanalysis.

===2010–present===
Miller&#x27;s 2009-2010 course, delivered at the Théâtre Déjazet, was dedicated to Lacan&#x27;s life, examining links between Lacan&#x27;s psychoanalytic ethics and biographical details that Miller had not previously related in public. The course was later partially written up and published as &quot;Vie de Lacan&quot; (2011).

Miller&#x27;s ongoing psychoanalytic teaching is regularly translated into English, as are his frequent articles and interviews on current events.

&quot;Book XIX&quot; of the Seminar of Jacques Lacan appeared in 2011 and &quot;Book VI&quot; in 2013.
