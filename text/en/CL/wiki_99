<text>Boyne Mountain Resort is a ski resort with a collection of accommodations in Northern Michigan located near Boyne City operated by Boyne Resorts. The center piece is an upscale resort called The Mountain Grand Lodge and Spa.

Boyne Mountain has continued use of the first chairlift built, constructed by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1936 for use at its new resort in Sun Valley, Idaho. It is also the location of Avalanche Bay, the largest indoor water park in Michigan. Boyne Mountain is the sister resort of Boyne Highlands.

== History==
The Boyne Mountain Resort was originally co-developed by Everett Kircher, Jim Christianson and John Norton. The group purchased the site for $1 in 1948 from Michigan Senator William Pierson and opened it as a ski resort in 1949. The founders acquired the first chairlift ever built (from Sun Valley, Idaho) and moved it to Boyne Mountain where parts are still in use today.

Between 1948 and 1992, Boyne Mountain and Boyne Highlands innovated in chairlifts, creating the world&#x27;s first triple chairlift (1963), world&#x27;s first quad chairlift (1965) and the US&#x27;s first six-passenger chairlift (1992).

==Skiing and snowboarding==
===Alpine skiing and snowboarding===
Boyne Mountain has ten chairlifts and a carpet lift, which lead to 60 runs including all of the standard difficulty ratings, from green to double black.

===Freestyle skiing and snowboarding===
Boyne Mountain has four terrain parks and a ski cross course. The biggest park is called &quot;Meadows Terrain Park,&quot; and others include &quot;Ramshead Park&quot; and &quot;Fritz Progression Park&quot;.

==Other activities==
===Golf===
Boyne Mountain has two nearby golf courses: The Alpine and The Monument.

====The Alpine====
The Alpine course at Boyne Mountain weaves down the mountain towards Deer Lake. There are several water hazards and sand bunkers placed by the owners, making for, in their words, &quot;A thrilling round&quot;.

====The Monument====
The Monument course has each hole dedicated to a golf legend, and uses golf course designs pioneered by several different architects. The owners refer to it as a &quot;playable hall of fame.&quot;

===The Mountain Grand Lodge and Spa===
The Mountain Grand Lodge and Spa is very close to the mountain and contains a spa, lodging, an indoor waterpark, and is located next to the Ski Rental Shop. It opened in the winter of 2005

===Zipline Adventure===
The Adventure Center&#x27;s Zipline Adventure has a 2.5 hour long zipline tour and an under an hour Twin Zip. The full tour features 10 lines (nine in the winter) and reach speeds up to 20-25 mph. The Twin Zip is 780 feet long and 25+ feet high and is the last zip of the full tour.

===Disc golf===
There is a disc golf course starting at the top of Boyne Mountain at Hemlock and ends at the Ski Patrol building. Disc rentals are available at the Adventure Center.

===Swimming===
Boyne Mountain has luxurious heated pools and hot tubs at the Clock Tower Lodge and the Mountain Grand Lodge and Spa. All guests staying at the resort have access to the Clock Tower Lodge pool and hot tub. During the summer months, the Dear Lake Beach is open for swimming and beach activities and games.

<doc id="1190098" wikidata="Q16983180" url="?curid=1190098" title="On the Twentieth Century">
<text>On the Twentieth Century is a musical with book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Cy Coleman. Based partly on the 1932 play &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; and its 1934 film adaptation, the musical is part operetta, part farce and part screwball comedy. The story involves the behind-the-scenes relationship between Lily, a temperamental actress and Oscar, a bankrupt theatre producer. On a luxury train traveling from Chicago to New York in the early 1930s, Oscar tries to cajole the glamorous Hollywood star into playing the lead in his new, but not-yet-written drama, and perhaps to rekindle their romance.

The musical ran on Broadway in 1978–1979, running for 449 performances and winning five Tony Awards. It showcased Madeline Kahn in the role of Lily Garland, and when Kahn left the show, the role launched the career of Judy Kaye. Several revivals followed in London and elsewhere, and a 2015 Broadway revival featured Kristin Chenoweth and Peter Gallagher.

==Background==
Comden and Green based the musical on three works: the 1934 Howard Hawks film &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;; the original 1932 play of the same name by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur; and Hecht&#x27;s and MacArthur&#x27;s inspiration, Charles Bruce Millholland&#x27;s unproduced play about his experiences working for theater producer David Belasco, &quot;Napoleon of Broadway&quot;.

Cy Coleman, when asked to compose the score, initially refused. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to do twenties pastiche – there was too much of that around,&quot; he recalled. &quot;But when I realized the main characters had these larger-than-life personalities, I thought – ah, comic opera! Even the tikka-tikka-tikka patter of a locomotive train has the rhythm of comic opera.&quot; Coleman agreed to write the music for the show and produced an operetta-style score reminiscent of the works of Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf Friml.

==Plot summary==

===Act I===
In the early 1930s, egomaniacal impresario Oscar Jaffee is on the skids after four flops in a row. His latest show has abruptly closed in Chicago, leaving his angry cast and crew (to whom he owes back salary) &quot;Stranded Again.&quot; On the lam, Oscar secretly sends orders to Owen O&#x27;Malley and Oliver Webb, his press agent and business manager, to meet him on the Twentieth Century Limited to New York and to get tickets for Drawing Room &quot;A.&quot;

On the La Salle Station platform, the passengers praise the wonders of a journey &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;. Owen and Oliver, bursting into Drawing Room &quot;A,&quot; discover Congressman Grover Lockwood in a compromising position with his secretary Anita. Oliver easily persuades them to abandon Drawing Room &quot;A.&quot; After making it on the departing train by climbing through a window, Oscar tells Owen and Oliver that he will soon regain his riches and success (&quot;I Rise Again&quot;). He reveals the reason they had to get Drawing Room &quot;A&quot;: at the next stop, his former lover and protegee, Lily Garland (née Mildred Plotka), now a temperamental film star, will board the train and will be staying next door in Drawing Room &#x27;B&#x27;. Oliver and Owen doubt that she will agree to be in Oscar&#x27;s new play now that she&#x27;s a movie star; Oscar insists that she will.

In a flashback, Oscar remembers the time he auditioned spoiled actress Imelda Thornton for the leading role in a play. Oscar discovered that the gawky young accompanist, Mildred Plotka, could sing &quot;The Indian Maiden&#x27;s Lament&quot; much better than Imelda, even finishing with an operatic cadenza. Oscar immediately decided to cast Mildred in the leading role as &quot;Veronique,&quot; a French street singer who wouldn&#x27;t sleep with Otto von Bismarck and thus instigated the Franco-Prussian War. Mildred insisted that she did not want to be an actress, but Oscar convinced her to take the part, renaming her Lily Garland.

The conductor warns the passengers in Drawing Room &quot;A&quot; that a lunatic is on board the train. He then announces, &quot;I Have Written a Play&quot;, titled &quot;Life on a Train.&quot; Oscar sends the conductor away. At Englewood, Illinois, all the passengers, especially Oscar, are thrilled that they and Lily Garland will be on the train &quot;Together&quot;. Lily&#x27;s costar and lover, Bruce Granit, fails to get off the train before it departs, and must come along for the ride. Owen and Oliver stop by Drawing Room &quot;B&quot; and beg Lily to return, revealing that Oscar is so poor, his theatre will be repossessed the next day. She replies, &quot;Never&quot;. Bruce, suspicions aroused by Lily&#x27;s passionate tirade, asks if she ever had a relationship with Oscar. She recites a long list of former lovers and insists that Oscar was never one of them. Still, in their separate drawing rooms, Oscar and Lily recall the relationship they once had (&quot;Our Private World&quot;).

In the observation car, passengers complain that the religious lunatic has stuck &quot;Repent for the time is at hand&quot; stickers everywhere. The conductor assures them that they will catch the lunatic soon. This turns out to be Mrs. Letitia Primrose, who says it is her mission to warn sinners to &quot;Repent.&quot; These stickers inspire Oscar with an idea for his new play: he will direct &quot;The Passion of Mary Magdalene&quot;, a role so good that Lily could not possibly refuse it. Bruce is equally confident that Lily will continue to act opposite him in Hollywood. In their respective drawing rooms, each prepares to meet with Lily again and vows that she will be his (&quot;Mine&quot;). As Oliver and Owen prepare a press release for the new play, Letitia remarks that she sponsors creative endeavors. She declares that she is the founder and president of Primrose Restoria Pills, and she does good works with her extra capital.

Lily enters Drawing Room &quot;B&quot; in a sexy negligee, and as Bruce and she begin playing, Oscar walks in. Oscar reveals his former relationship with Lily, and Bruce, outraged, walks out. Lily angrily recalls Oscar&#x27;s jealousy and possessiveness in their former Svengali-like relationship. She is rich and successful without him; but Oscar retorts that she has lost her art by selling out to Hollywood (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got it All&quot;). Lily tells Oscar she plans to sign with successful producer Max Jacobs, Oscar&#x27;s former assistant stage manager. Oscar furiously returns to Drawing Room &quot;A&quot;, but he is mollified when Oliver and Owen introduce him to rich and religious Mrs. Primrose. Congressman Lockwood enters and announces, &quot;I Have Written a Play&quot;, titled &quot;Life on the Hog Market Committee.&quot; They send him out and Oscar and Mrs. Primrose shake hands as Bruce and Lily sit down to dinner in the next car (&quot;On The Twentieth Century&quot; (reprise)).

===Act II===
In an entr&#x27;acte, four porters philosophically declare that &quot;Life Is Like a Train.&quot;

Owen, Oliver and Oscar congratulate themselves on obtaining Mrs. Primrose&#x27;s check for $200,000 (&quot;Five Zeros&quot;). Lily&#x27;s maid, Agnes, brings Oscar a message: Lily wants to see him immediately. Dr. Johnson detains him, however, declaring, &quot;I Have Written a Play&quot;, titled &quot;Life in a Metropolitan Hospital&quot;. Oscar ignores Dr. Johnson and enters Drawing Room &#x27;B&#x27;. Lily tells Oscar that she has decided to give him money to help him with his financial situation. Oscar proudly reveals Mrs. Primrose&#x27;s check and describes the Mary Magdalene play to Lily. Lily is transfixed and begins acting the part, ending with Oscar&#x27;s arms around her waist. She jolts back to reality and insists on meeting Mrs. Primrose. Owen and Oliver escort Lily to Drawing Room &quot;A&quot;, where they, Mrs. Primrose, and Oscar all attempt to persuade Lily to sign the contract. Bruce enters and tries to convince her not to sign it (&quot;Sextet&quot;). Lily resolves not to live in the past and refuses to sign, deciding to continue in movies with Bruce. Oscar suggests a compromise; if Lily does the play, Mrs. Primrose can pay for the movie too. Lily finds this very exciting and informally agrees. She insists on a few minutes alone before signing the contract.

In Cleveland, Ohio, some officers have boarded the train. They are looking for Mrs. Primrose, who escaped from the Benzinger Clinic mental institution that morning, and they have come to take her back. The news soon spreads throughout the train: &quot;She&#x27;s a Nut!&quot; Oscar suddenly has no money again, and Lily, who has not yet signed the contract, angrily confronts him. Max Jacobs arrives with a new play, and Lily joyously greets him. She reads over the play, trying to envision herself as the decadent, glamorous title character, &quot;Babette&quot;, but her thoughts keep straying to Mary Magdalene. Nevertheless, she finally decides that she will do Max&#x27;s play.

Oscar meets Oliver and Owen in the observation car. He is carrying a gun and insists that he is going to end it all. He details &quot;The Legacy&quot; he is leaving them and returns to Drawing Room &quot;A&quot;. Oliver and Owen are convinced he&#x27;s just being dramatic, but then they hear gunshots. They find Mrs. Primrose holding the gun and Oscar mournfully staggering. She tried to take the gun away from him and it went off. Dr. Johnson examines Oscar and finds nothing wrong with him. Oscar says he will read Dr. Johnson&#x27;s play if she pretends he really is wounded. Dr. Johnson agrees, and Owen tells Lily that Oscar is dying. Oscar begs her to sign the contract before he dies. She signs it, and they passionately sing to each other (&quot;Lily, Oscar&quot;). Max Jacobs rushes in, and Oscar, very much alive, gleefully shows him the contract. Lily tells him to check the signature. She has signed &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;! She and Oscar scream ridiculous insults at each other until they start laughing and fall into each other&#x27;s arms. They reconcile, kissing passionately, resulting in an outraged Max leaving the room. The ensemble comes out, dressed in white, as Owen and Oliver throw petals, followed by Lily in a wedding dress and Oscar in a white tuxedo. The newlyweds embrace and join the company in one final proclamation that &quot;Life is like a train!&quot; (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Productions==
Following a tryout at the Colonial Theatre in Boston, the Broadway production opened on February 19, 1978 at the St. James Theatre to mixed reviews. It ran for 11 previews and 449 performances. Directed by Hal Prince and choreographed by Larry Fuller, the cast starred John Cullum and Madeline Kahn, and featured Imogene Coca and Kevin Kline. The show won Tony Awards for best score and best book, among others. After only nine weeks, Kahn departed the show. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;she said she was withdrawing because of damage to her vocal cords.&quot; She was replaced by understudy Judy Kaye, who had been playing a small role, and the critics were invited to return. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;bang, boom, overnight [Kaye] is a star.&quot; They praised her performance, Kaye won a Theatre World Award, and her theatrical career took off. She later starred in the US tour opposite Rock Hudson.

A London staging, produced by Harold Fielding, and starring Keith Michell as Oscar, Julia McKenzie as Lily, Mark Wynter as Bruce and Ann Beach as Mrs. Primrose, opened on March 19, 1980, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, and ran for 165 performances. The musical was nominated for the Olivier Award, &quot;Musical of the Year&quot;, and McKenzie was nominated for Actress of the Year in a Musical. As part of an Actors Fund benefit, a one night staged concert was held on September 26, 2005 at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York, starring Marin Mazzie as Lily, Douglas Sills as Oscar, Joanne Worley as Letitia and Christopher Sieber as Bruce. The first London revival was staged at the Union Theatre, Southwark in December 2010 and January 2011. Howard Samuels played Oscar and Rebecca Vere was Lily. The show was directed by Ryan McBryde.

In 2011, Roundabout Theatre Company had a reading with Hugh Jackman, Kristin Chenoweth and Andrea Martin participating. Roundabout revived the musical on Broadway, at the American Airlines Theatre, beginning previews on February 12, 2015, and officially opening on March 15, 2015 for a limited run through July 19, 2015 (extended from the original closing date of July 5). Scott Ellis directed, and choreography was by Warren Carlyle. The cast starred Chenoweth as Lily and Peter Gallagher as Oscar, and featured Andy Karl as Bruce, Mark Linn-Baker as Oliver, Michael McGrath as Owen and Mary Louise Wilson as Letitia. Designers included David Rockwell (set), William Ivey Long (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting). The production was nominated for five Tony Awards, including best revival, but did not win any. The song &quot;The Legacy&quot; from the original score was rewritten as &quot;Because of Her&quot;, using Coleman&#x27;s original music but new lyrics by Amanda Green about Oscar&#x27;s acknowledgement of Lily&#x27;s importance in his life.

A Japanese production starring Takahisa Masuda played from March 12 to 31, 2024, at the Tokyu Theatre Orb before moving to Osaka April 5 to 10 at the Orix Theater.

<doc id="1190101" wikidata="Q295322" url="?curid=1190101" title="Metta Sandiford-Artest">
<text>Metta Sandiford-Artest (born Ronald William Artest Jr.; November 13, 1979), previously legally named Metta World Peace, is an American former professional basketball player who played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Under the name Ron Artest, he played college basketball for the St. John&#x27;s Red Storm. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft.

In 2001, he signed with the Indiana Pacers, where he won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and was also named an NBA All-Star in 2004. Later that year, he was involved in a fight between the Pacers and the Detroit Pistons, and was suspended for the remainder of the 2004–05 season. Weeks after the start of the 2005–06 season, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings, and spent the 2008–09 season with the Houston Rockets. In 2009, he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, and helped the team win the NBA championship in 2010.

In 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace, and continued to play with the Lakers until 2013, when he signed with the New York Knicks. After a year of hiatus from the NBA, he returned to the Lakers for his final seasons in 2015 before retiring in 2017. In 2020, he changed his name to Metta Sandiford-Artest.

==Early life==

Metta Sandiford-Artest was born Ronald William Artest Jr. on November 13, 1979, and raised in Queensbridge in Long Island City, Queens, New York. He has two younger brothers, Isaiah and Daniel. He played high school basketball at La Salle Academy. He also teamed with future NBA players Elton Brand and Lamar Odom on the same Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team.

Growing up, Artest witnessed the killing of a fellow player, 19-year-old Lloyd Newton, on a basketball court in Niagara Falls, New York, during an altercation at a 1991 YMCA-sanctioned basketball tournament. Artest recalled the incident during an interview in 2009: &quot;I remember one time, one of my friends, he was playing basketball and they were winning the game. It was so competitive, they broke a leg from a table and they threw it and it went right through his heart and he died right on the court. So I&#x27;m accustomed playing basketball really rough.&quot;

==College career==
Artest played college basketball at St. John&#x27;s University from 1997 to 1999. At St. John&#x27;s, he majored in mathematics. In 1999, he led the Red Storm to a 14–4 record in the Big East Conference and 28–9 overall and the Elite Eight of the NCAA Division I Tournament, losing to Ohio State.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bulls (1999–2002)===

Artest was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the 16th pick of the 1999 NBA draft.

Artest played a total of 175 games for the Bulls over years, the bulk as a starter, during which time he averaged about 12.5 points and just over four rebounds per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in the 1999–2000 season.

=== Indiana Pacers (2002–2006) ===
Midway through the 2001–02 season, Artest was traded by Chicago to the Indiana Pacers along with Ron Mercer, Brad Miller, and Kevin Ollie, for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Norman Richardson, and a second-round draft pick.
On January 27, 2003, Artest got into a verbal altercation with Miami Heat head coach Pat Riley and flashed an obscene gesture into the crowd and was suspended for four games. During the 2003–04 season with the Pacers, he averaged 18.3 points per game, 5.7 rebounds per game, and 3.7 assists per game. Artest made the 2004 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve and was named the Defensive Player of the Year. He wore three jersey numbers for the Pacers: 15, 23, and 91.

====The Malice at the Palace====

On November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an altercation among players and fans during a game in Auburn Hills, Michigan, between Artest&#x27;s Pacers and the home team Detroit Pistons. The brawl involved Artest, Pistons center Ben Wallace, Artest&#x27;s teammates Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and Stephen Jackson, several other players, and spectators including Pistons fans John Green and A. J. Shackleford.

The fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. O&#x27;Neal, Jackson, and Wallace were suspended indefinitely the day after the game. A day later, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games. Artest missed 86 games, the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history.

====Aftermath and trade====

After playing 16 games early in the 2005–06 season, Artest demanded a trade from the Indiana Pacers, and he was placed on the team&#x27;s inactive roster. Artest&#x27;s call for a trade created a rift between him and his teammates. &quot;We felt betrayed, a little disrespected,&quot; teammate Jermaine O&#x27;Neal said. As for their basketball relationship, O&#x27;Neal added: &quot;The business relationship is over. That&#x27;s fact.&quot; Pacers president Larry Bird said he also felt &quot;betrayed&quot; and &quot;disappointed.&quot;

On January 24, 2006, reports from NBA sources confirmed that the Sacramento Kings had agreed to trade Peja Stojaković to the Pacers for Artest. However, before the trade could be completed, many press outlets reported that Artest had informed team management that he did not want to go to the Kings. According to Artest&#x27;s agent, his original trade request was only made because he was upset when he heard rumors that the Pacers were going to trade him to the Kings for Stojaković early in the season. While not denying his agent&#x27;s story, Artest did deny that he had rejected the trade to Sacramento, saying that he would play anywhere, contradicting earlier press accounts stating Artest was holding up the trade. Given conflicting accounts, it is unclear why the trade was delayed, but it was nonetheless completed on January 25 and Artest was officially sent to the Kings for Stojaković.

===Sacramento Kings (2006–2008)===
Though traded midseason to the Kings franchise, Artest quickly found his place on the team by providing some much-needed defense. Though many feared his abrasive personality would be a problem, he worked well with his teammates and then-coach Rick Adelman. Artest wore #93 for his jersey number with the Kings. After acquiring Artest in late January 2006, the team immediately went on a 14–5 run, the team&#x27;s best run of the season. The Kings broke .500 and landed the eighth spot in the Western Conference. This prompted ESPN to declare that &quot;Ron Artest has breathed new life in the Sacramento Kings and enhanced their chances of reaching the playoffs for the ninth straight year.&quot; Fox Sports proclaimed, &quot;Artest has Kings back in playoff hunt.&quot;

He was suspended for Game 2 of the team&#x27;s first-round series against the San Antonio Spurs following a flagrant foul (elbow to the head) on Manu Ginóbili. The Kings eventually were eliminated from the playoffs in six games.

After the playoffs, Artest offered to donate his entire salary to keep teammate Bonzi Wells, who became a free agent after the 2005–06 NBA season, with the team. He even jokingly threatened to kill Wells if he did not re-sign with the Kings. Wells was later picked up by the Houston Rockets and then traded to the New Orleans Hornets for former Sacramento Kings player Bobby Jackson. Artest also offered to donate his salary to retain the services of head coach Rick Adelman, whose contract expired after the same season. Adelman and the Kings did not agree on a contract extension so the two parted ways.

===Houston Rockets (2008–2009)===
On July 29, 2008, it was reported that Artest was to be traded to the Houston Rockets along with Patrick Ewing Jr. and Sean Singletary for Bobby Jackson, recently drafted forward Donté Greene, a 2009 first-round draft pick, and cash considerations. The deal was made official on August 14, due to Greene&#x27;s rookie contract signing on July 14. In response to the trade, Yao Ming was generally positive, but jokingly expressed hope that Artest is &quot;not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands.&quot; In response, Artest said, &quot;This is Tracy (McGrady) and Yao&#x27;s team, you know. I&#x27;m not going to take it personal. I understand what Yao said, but I&#x27;m still ghetto. That&#x27;s not going to change. I&#x27;m never going to change my culture. Yao has played with a lot of black players, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as I represent my culture.&quot;

Artest and Yao later exchanged extensive phone calls. Artest also said, &quot;Whatever Adelman needs me to do, whether that&#x27;s come off the bench, sixth, seventh man, start, I don&#x27;t even care. Whatever he needs me to do, I&#x27;m 100 percent sure it&#x27;s going to work out.&quot;

On October 30, 2008, Artest received his first technical as a Houston Rocket, as he raced towards a group of Dallas Mavericks players and then quickly went to Yao Ming who bumped Josh Howard after play stopped. Artest was trying to pull Yao away from the play and to the foul line, but contact was made with Maverick players. The TNT broadcast crew felt that this technical was unwarranted and reckoned it was based upon Artest&#x27;s prior reputation as a feisty player in the league. In the playoffs, Artest helped the Rockets advance past the first round for the first time in 12 seasons. In Game 2 of the second round against the Los Angeles Lakers, Artest, who was battling for rebounding position with Kobe Bryant, was elbowed in the neck by Bryant, which was later ruled to be a Type 1 flagrant foul. After being called for an offensive foul, Artest was indignant and proceeded to antagonize Bryant after the play, which eventually led to an ejection by Joe Crawford. In Game 3, Artest was again ejected in the fourth quarter after a hard foul on Pau Gasol, who was attempting to dunk on a fast-break. It was determined the next day that the foul was not serious enough to warrant an ejection, and the flagrant foul was downgraded.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2009–2013)===

==== 2009–11: Championship season ====
In July 2009, the Los Angeles Lakers signed Artest to a five-year deal worth about $33 million. Artest chose the number 37 jersey, which he said was in honor of Michael Jackson. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album was at No. 1 on the charts for 37 straight weeks.

In Game 5 of the 2010 Western Conference Finals, Artest hit a game-winning shot at the buzzer after grabbing a last second offensive rebound. He scored 25 points against the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 and went to the NBA Finals for the first time in his career. In the finals, the Lakers defeated the Boston Celtics, four games to three. Artest scored 20 points in the clincher and sank the team&#x27;s last field goal – a three-pointer late in the fourth quarter – to virtually seal the victory. Afterwards, Lakers head coach Phil Jackson called Artest the most valuable player of Game 7 against the Celtics. He won his first championship ring with the Lakers.

For the 2010–11 season, Artest switched back to number 15, his college number at St. John&#x27;s and the first number he wore in his NBA career.

On April 26, 2011, Artest won the NBA&#x27;s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award.

==== 2011–13: Controversy and injury-riddled season ====
Artest changed his name to Metta World Peace during the offseason. He came into training camp for the out of shape. Consequently, new Lakers coach Mike Brown moved him to a reserve role with reduced playing time. World Peace lamented that Brown&#x27;s coaching style placed too much emphasis on statistics.

On April 22, 2012, in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, World Peace elbowed James Harden in the head as he was celebrating a dunk. He received a flagrant foul 2 and was immediately ejected. Harden was later found to have suffered a concussion. After the game, World Peace apologized and stated that the elbow was &quot;unintentional.&quot; On April 24, 2012, World Peace was suspended for seven games, meaning he would miss the Lakers&#x27; season finale game against the Sacramento Kings as well as the first few games of the playoffs.

After a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season, the Lakers fired Brown as head coach and hired Mike D&#x27;Antoni. On December 18, 2012, in a win against the Philadelphia 76ers, he grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds to add to his 19 points. On January 11, 2013, he suffered a right leg injury against the Thunder that would hamper him for two months. Around the same time, he also had an injury to his right arm that made it difficult to bend. His health worsened to the point where D&#x27;Antoni moved him off the perimeter on defense and had him guard power forwards instead. By mid-March, he was able to guard the perimeter again. On March 25, against the Golden State Warriors, World Peace tore the lateral meniscus in his left knee. He underwent surgery that was originally estimated to sideline him for six weeks. Despite the estimates, he returned 12 days after his surgery. In his absence, D&#x27;Antoni was using a reduced seven-man rotation with Kobe Bryant playing close to all 48 minutes each game. World Peace wanted to reduce his teammates&#x27; workload, if even for a few minutes, as the Lakers fought to qualify for the playoffs. The Lakers qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, but were swept 4–0 by San Antonio in the first round. Due to the Lakers&#x27; other injuries, World Peace played in Game 3 in spite of running with discomfort after having fluid drained from a cyst behind his surgically repaired left knee. He missed the final game of the series, and later admitted he came back too soon. For the season, he averaged his most points (12.4) since 2008–09, and shot his highest percentage (.404) since 2009–10. Still, ESPN wrote those numbers indicated that &quot;the 33-year-old is clearly on the decline.&quot;

On July 11, 2013, after four seasons with the Lakers, the team waived World Peace via the amnesty clause to gain relief from the salary cap.

===New York Knicks (2013–2014)===
On July 16, 2013, World Peace signed a two-year deal with his hometown team the New York Knicks. On February 24, 2014, he was waived by the Knicks after they bought out his contract.

===Sichuan Blue Whales (2014)===
On August 4, 2014, World Peace signed with the Sichuan Blue Whales of the Chinese Basketball Association. Due to a recurrent knee injury, he was replaced on the roster in December 2014 with Daniel Orton. In 15 games, World Peace averaged 19 points, 6 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game.

=== Pallacanestro Cantù (2015) ===
On March 24, 2015, World Peace signed with Pallacanestro Cantù of Italy for the rest of the 2014–15 Lega Basket Serie A season. On May 27, 2015, in Cantù&#x27;s Game 5 quarter-final loss to Reyer Venezia Mestre which ended their season, World Peace was ejected from the game and charged with five fouls after getting involved in a skirmish during the fourth quarter. In July 2015, he parted ways with the club after the two parties could not come to a new contract agreement.

===Return to the Lakers (2015–2017)===
On September 24, 2015, World Peace signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the franchise for a second stint. On November 6, 2015, he made his season debut in a 104–98 win over the Brooklyn Nets, playing 17 minutes with a plus-minus of 12. Teammate Kobe Bryant praised him for his impact on &quot;everybody on the floor defensively.&quot;

On September 21, 2016, World Peace re-signed with the Lakers. On April 11, 2017, World Peace scored a team-leading 18 points in the second half to help the Lakers extend its longest winning streak in four years to five games with a 108–96 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. He had the ball in his hands with the crowd on its feet for the Lakers&#x27; final possession in what was potentially his final game at Staples Center. During the game, he got his 1,716th and 1,717th career steals to move past Ron Harper for 22nd place in NBA history.

=== New Orleans Gators (2017) ===
During the offseason, World Peace played with the New Orleans Gators of the Global Mixed Gender Basketball (GMGB) League.

=== San Diego Kings (2019) ===
In 2019, World Peace signed a one-day contract with the San Diego Kings of the American Basketball Association to bolster their squad against the four-time defending league champion Jacksonville Giants.

==Coaching career==
World Peace was a player development coach in 2017–18 for the South Bay Lakers, the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; development-league team in the G League. During the offseason in 2018, he played 3x3 basketball with the BIG3. He played under the name Ron Artest at the request of league co-founder Ice Cube, who wanted to &quot;turn back the clock a little bit.&quot;

==Media presence==

===Television===
In April 2010, it was announced that Artest would help develop and produce his own reality show, &quot;They Call Me Crazy&quot;, in conjunction with E1 Entertainment and Tijuana Entertainment.

On December 18, 2010, an art show honoring Artest was held in Toronto, Canada. Entitled Lovable Badass, the show featured work by 30 Canadian and American artists, illustrators, painters and sculptors inspired by the athlete. Artest made a surprise appearance at the exhibition&#x27;s opening night, commenting that &quot;(the show) was definitely special. It was unexpected. Overwhelming.&quot;

Artest was part of the line-up for the thirteenth season of the reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, though he finished in last place, being eliminated in the show&#x27;s first week.

In October 2012, he appeared as a panelist on Nickelodeon&#x27;s game show &quot;Figure It Out&quot;.

In September 2013, he made the first in a recurring series of skits on the Comedy Central sketch show &quot;Key and Peele&quot; called &quot;Metta World News,&quot; in which he plays a newscaster.

Peace competed against actor Skylar Astin in an episode of Spike&#x27;s &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; that aired June 21, 2017. He performed Cypress Hill&#x27;s &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot; and Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Roar&quot; but did not win.

In January 2018, it was announced that World Peace was a contestant in the first American edition of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. Metta became the fourth celebrity to be evicted from the house on Day 20. He also appeared in the second season as part of a Head of Household competition.

In 2023, Metta World Peace competed in season ten of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Cuddle Monster&quot; who Nick Cannon called the largest costume in this series. He was eliminated on &quot;Trolls Night&quot;.

===Artest Media Group===
World Peace is the founder of the Artest Media Group. Established in 2010, the brand management company&#x27;s clients include himself and music artists Vinita, Deacon, Sade Artest, Rugby, and Emmaline Cleary. Music producers Wip, Q, and Lucky are also associated with the group. On February 19, 2013, World Peace was awoken by a squad of police who received a tip there had been gun play within his property. Authorities were quick to recognize their mistake after World Peace explained that the armed individuals were actors shooting a &quot;life on the streets&quot;-styled movie for his group.

===Discography===

On October 31, 2006, Artest released a rap album entitled &quot;My World&quot;. He published the album on the Lightyear Records label under his own imprint, Tru Warier Records. The album features guest artists P. Diddy, Juvenile, Mike Jones, Big Kap, Nature and Capone.

===Advocacy===

He has become involved in advocacy relating to mental health issues. In December 2010, he announced that he would donate some or all of his salary for the 2011–12 NBA season toward mental health awareness charities. Artest also auctioned off his 2009–10 championship ring and donated the proceeds to various mental health charities nationwide. In 2016, he told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Some people don&#x27;t understand mental health is broad. You have to ask questions. Are you depressed? Are you schizophrenic? Do you have anxiety? Are you bipolar? Those are the different things that come under the banner of mental health.&quot;

He has posed for PETA ad campaigns encouraging people to report animal abuse and to have their pets neutered.

On March 26, 2024, Artest endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy for the 2024 United States presidential election at a campaign event.

==Disciplinary and legal issues==
===Early career incidents===
In a December 2009 &quot;Sporting News&quot; interview, Artest admitted he led a &quot;wild&quot; lifestyle as a young player, and drank Hennessy cognac in the locker room at halftime while with the Bulls. In February 2004, he wore a bathrobe over his practice uniform to a Pacers practice as &quot;a symbolic reminder to take it easy.&quot;

Artest was suspended for three games in 2003 for destroying a TV camera at Madison Square Garden, and for four games the same year for a confrontation with Miami Heat coach Pat Riley. He was also suspended for two games early in the 2004–05 season by Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle after he allegedly asked for a month off because he was tired from promoting an R&amp;B album for the group Allure on his Tru Warier production label, on which he released his own album, a rap recording titled &quot;My World&quot;, in October 2006.

===The Malice at the Palace===

On November 19, 2004, Artest was at the center of an altercation among players and fans during a game in Auburn Hills, Michigan, between Artest&#x27;s Pacers and the home team Detroit Pistons.

The brawl began when Artest fouled Pistons center Ben Wallace as Wallace was putting up a shot. Wallace, upset at being fouled hard when the game was effectively over (the Pacers led 97–82 with less than 50 seconds to go), responded by shoving Artest in the face, leading to an altercation near the scorer&#x27;s table. Artest walked to the sideline and laid down on the scorer&#x27;s table. Reacting to Wallace throwing something at Artest, Pistons fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him. Artest jumped into the front-row seats and confronted a man he incorrectly believed to be responsible, which in turn erupted into a brawl between Pistons fans and several of the Pacers. Artest returned to the basketball court, and punched Pistons fan A.J. Shackleford, who was apparently taunting Artest verbally. This fight resulted in the game being stopped with less than a minute remaining. Artest&#x27;s teammates Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and Stephen Jackson were suspended indefinitely the day after the game, along with Wallace.

On November 21, the NBA suspended Artest for the rest of the regular season, plus any playoff games. All told, Artest missed 86 games (73 regular season games plus 13 playoff games), the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. Eight other players (four Pacers and four Pistons) received suspensions, without pay, which ranged from one to thirty games in length. Each of the players involved were levied fines and ordered to do community service. Several fans were also charged and were banned from attending Pistons games for life. Artest lost approximately $5 million in salary due to the suspension.

===Legal issues===

On March 5, 2007, Artest was arrested for domestic violence, and excused from the Sacramento Kings indefinitely by GM Geoff Petrie. On March 10, Kings announced that Artest would return to the team, while his case was being reviewed by the Placer County District Attorney. On May 3, he was sentenced to 20 days in jail and community service. Artest spent only 10 days in the jail, as the judge stayed 10 days of the sentence, and served the remainder in a work release program. On July 14, 2007, the NBA suspended Artest for seven games at the beginning of the 2007–08 NBA season for his legal problems.

In 2007, Artest was forced to relinquish ownership of his dog, a Great Dane, for malnutrition and neglect.

==Personal life==

On September 16, 2011, Artest&#x27;s name was officially changed to Metta World Peace. &quot;Metta&quot; was his first name, and &quot;World Peace&quot; was his surname. &quot;Changing my name was meant to inspire and bring youth together all around the world,&quot; World Peace said in a statement released after the name change court hearing. His publicist, Courtney Barnes, said that World Peace chose Metta as his first name because it is a traditional Buddhist word that means loving kindness and friendliness towards all.

World Peace and Kimsha Hatfield started an on-and-off relationship when they were 15 and 14. Their first child Sadie was born in 1997.
Eventually the two married in June 2003 but divorced in 2009. Kimsha was a cast member on VH1&#x27;s reality TV show &quot;Basketball Wives: LA&quot;. The two went on to have two more children together, Ron III and Diamond. Ron III also became a professional basketball player. World Peace has another son, Jeron, with his former high school girlfriend Jennifer Palma. He put a brother through law school and became a grandfather with the birth of his eldest daughter Sadie&#x27;s first child.

On May 4, 2020, World Peace announced that he had changed his name once again to Metta Sandiford-Artest, combining his last name with that of his second wife, Maya Sandiford.

Sandiford-Artest has his own company, The Artest Management Group. The company helps athletes with tax preparation and also has a film division. He also has an interest in mathematics which started in high school, and which he uses in developing a sports app and in taking analytics classes at UCLA. In March 2023, Sandiford-Artest was announced as a partner in MOORvision Technologies and Ucam, a camera built to capture athlete&#x27;s point of view during games.

<text>Malcolm de Chazal (12 September 1902 – 1 October 1981) was a Mauritian writer, painter, and visionary, known especially for his &quot;Sens-Plastique&quot;, a work consisting of several thousand aphorisms and pensées.

==Early life and education==
Chazal was born in Vacoas of a French family long established in Mauritius and wrote all his works in French. Except for six years at Louisiana State University, where he received an engineering degree, he spent most of his time in Mauritius where he worked as an agronomist on sugar plantations and later for the Office of Telecommunications.

==Writing==
In 1940 he began to publish in Mauritius a series of volumes consisting of hundreds of numbered thoughts and ideas entitled &quot;Pensées.&quot; In 1945, a seventh volume of &quot;Pensées&quot;, bound with another collection of unnumbered aphorisms entitled &quot;Sens-Plastique&quot; appeared, and two years later a separate &quot;Sens-Plastique&quot;, Volume II, appeared. It was this latter volume on which the Gallimard edition of 1948 was based that brought Chazal into prominence in France. He was hailed as a surrealist by André Breton and ex Journalist Adeenarain M Tatiah. The following examples may illustrate the novelty and variety of &quot;Sens-Plastique.&quot;

In the prefaces and afterwords of the various editions of &quot;Sens-Plastique&quot; Chazal explained his method of thinking and writing as follows:
Chazal&#x27;s other writings include notably &quot;La Vie Filtrée&quot; (1949), a collection of essays that elaborate the ideas found in &quot;Sens-Plastique&quot;, &quot;Sens Magique&quot; (1957) and &quot;Poèmes&quot; (1968 ), gnomic verses that dramatize the experiences described in &quot;Sens-Plastique&quot;, and &quot;Petrusmok&quot; (1951), the spiritual history of Mauritius found in its natural surroundings.

&quot;Sens-Plastique&quot; has been translated into English by Irving Weiss in a volume published by Green Integer (2008) as &quot;Sens-Plastique.&quot;

==Painting==
Chazal took up painting in the 1950s at the suggestion of Georges Braque. Unlike the speculative aphoristic character of his best-known writings, his paintings concentrated on natural forms and landscapes in a primitive, emblematic style.

<text>Sodium fluoroacetate, also known as compound 1080, is an organofluorine chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is the sodium salt of fluoroacetic acid. It contains sodium cations and fluoroacetate anions . This colourless salt has a taste similar to that of table salt (sodium chloride) and is used as a rodenticide.

== History and production ==
The effectiveness of sodium fluoroacetate as a rodenticide was reported in 1942. The name &quot;1080&quot; refers to the catalogue number of the poison, which became its brand name.

The salt is synthesized by treating sodium chloroacetate with potassium fluoride.

Both sodium and potassium salts are derivatives of fluoroacetic acid.

==Natural occurrence==
Fluoroacetate occurs naturally in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. It is one of only five known organofluorine-containing natural products.

===Fluoroacetate occurrence in &quot;Gastrolobium&quot; species===
&quot;Gastrolobium&quot; is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. This genus consists of over 100 species, and all but two are native to the southwest region of Western Australia, where they are known as &quot;poison peas&quot;. &quot;Gastrolobium&quot; growing in southwestern Australia concentrate fluoroacetate from low-fluoride soils. Brushtail possums, bush rats, and western grey kangaroos native to this region are capable of safely eating plants containing fluoroacetate, but livestock and introduced species from elsewhere in Australia are highly susceptible to the poison, as are species introduced from outside Australia, such as the red fox. The fact that many &quot;Gastrolobium&quot; species also have high secondary toxicity to non-native carnivores is thought to have limited the ability of cats to establish populations in locations where the plants form a major part of the understorey vegetation.

The presence of &quot;Gastrolobium&quot; species in Western Australia has often forced farmers to &#x27;scalp&#x27; their land, that is, remove the top soil and any poison pea seed which it may contain, and replace it with a new poison pea-free top soil sourced from elsewhere in which to sow crops. Similarly, after bushfires in north-western Queensland, cattlemen have to move livestock before the poisonous &quot;Gastrolobium grandiflorum&quot; emerges from the ashes.

 The related compound occurs naturally as a defensive compound in at least 40 plant species in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Africa. It was first identified in &quot;Dichapetalum cymosum&quot;, commonly known as gifblaar or poison leaf, by Marais in 1944. As early as 1904, colonists in Sierra Leone used extracts of &quot;Chailletia toxicaria&quot;, which also contains fluoroacetic acid or its salts, to poison rats. Several native Australian plant genera contain the toxin, including &quot;Gastrolobium&quot;, &quot;Gompholobium&quot;, &quot;Oxylobium&quot;, &quot;Nemcia&quot;, and &quot;Acacia&quot;. New Zealand&#x27;s native Puha contains 1080 in very low concentrations.

==Structure==
X-ray crystallography confirms that solid sodium fluoroacetate is a salt with intact fluoroacetate anions interacting with Na+ via a network of Na-O bonds.

== Toxicology ==
Sodium fluoroacetate is toxic to most obligate aerobic organisms, and highly toxic to mammals and insects. The oral dose of sodium fluoroacetate sufficient to be lethal in humans is 2–10 mg/kg.

The toxicity varies with species. The New Zealand Food Safety Authority established lethal doses for a number of species. Dogs, cats, and pigs appear to be most susceptible to poisoning.

The enzyme fluoroacetate dehalogenase has been discovered in a soil bacterium, which can detoxify fluoroacetate in the surrounding medium.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Fluoroacetate is structurally similar to acetate, which has a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. This similarity is the basis of the toxicity of fluoroacetate. Two related mechanisms for its toxicity have been discussed, with both beginning with the conversion of fluoroacetate to 2-fluorocitrate. 2-Fluorocitrate arises by condensation with oxaloacetate with fluoroacetyl coenzyme A, catalyzed by citrate synthase. Fluorocitrate binds very tightly to aconitase, thereby halting the citric acid cycle. This inhibition results in an accumulation of citrate in the blood. Citrate and fluorocitrate are allosteric inhibitors of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key enzyme in glycolysis. When PFK-1 is inhibited, cells are no longer able to metabolize carbohydrates, depriving them of energy. Alternatively, fluorocitrate interferes with citrate transport in the mitochondria.

=== Symptoms ===
In humans, the symptoms of poisoning normally appear between 30 minutes and three hours after exposure. Initial symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; sweating, confusion, and agitation follow. In significant poisoning, cardiac abnormalities including tachycardia or bradycardia, hypotension, and ECG changes develop. Neurological effects include muscle twitching and seizures; consciousness becomes progressively impaired after a few hours leading to coma. Death is normally due to ventricular arrhythmias, progressive hypotension unresponsive to treatment, and aspiration pneumonia.

Symptoms in domestic animals vary: dogs tend to show nervous system signs such as convulsions, vocalization, and uncontrollable running, while large herbivores such as cattle and sheep more predominantly show cardiac signs.

Sub-lethal doses of sodium fluoroacetate may cause damage to tissues with high energy needs, especially the brain, gonads, heart, lungs. Fetuses are also highly susceptible. Sub-lethal doses are typically completely metabolised and excreted within four days.

=== Treatment ===
Effective antidotes are unknown. Research in monkeys has shown that the use of glyceryl monoacetate can prevent problems if given after ingestion of sodium fluoroacetate, and this therapy has been tested in domestic animals with some positive results. In theory, glyceryl monoacetate supplies acetate ions to allow continuation of cellular respiration which the sodium fluoroacetate had disrupted.

Experiments of N. V. Goncharov and co-workers resulted in development of two varieties of potentially successful treatments. One combines a phenothiazine compound and a dioic acid compound. The other includes a phenothiazine compound, a nitroester compound, and ethanol.

In clinical cases, use of muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, mechanical ventilation, and other supportive measures may all be required. Few animals or people have been treated successfully after significant sodium fluoroacetate ingestions.

=== Tolerance ===
Animals can tolerate varying amounts of fluoroacetate. Mammalian carnivores and rodents tend to be the least tolerant, followed by mammalian herbivores, reptiles and amphibians, and finally fish. A lower metabolic rate seems to help with poison tolerance in general.

Many animals native to Australia seem to have developed additional tolerance to fluoroacetate beyond what general trends predict. Herbivore, seed-eating birds are exposed to very high amounts of natural fluoroacetate with no ill effect. Emus living in areas where fluoroacetate-producing plants grow can tolerate 150 times the concentration compared to emus living outside. Some native insects tolerate fluoroacetate and repurpose it as a defense chemical against carnivores.

Fluoacetate tolerance can be acquired in animals, though it is not fully clear how. In one study, sheep gut bacteria were genetically engineered to contain the fluoroacetate dehalogenase enzyme that inactivates sodium fluoroacetate. The bacteria were administered to sheep, who then showed reduced signs of toxicity after sodium fluoroacetate ingestion. A strain of natural bacterium that does the same was isolated from cattle rumen in 2012.

== Pesticide use ==

Sodium fluoroacetate is used as a pesticide, especially for mammalian pest species. Farmers and graziers use the poison to protect pastures and crops from various herbivorous mammals. In New Zealand and Australia it is also used to control invasive non-native mammals that prey on or compete with native wildlife and vegetation.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, sodium fluoroacetate was first used in rabbit control programmes in the early 1950s, where it is regarded as having &quot;a long history of proven effectiveness and safety&quot;. It is seen as a critical component of the integrated pest-control programmes for rabbits, foxes, wild dogs, and feral pigs. Since 1994, broad-scale fox control using 1080 meat baits in Western Australia has significantly improved the population numbers of several native species and led, for the first time, to three species of mammals being taken off the state&#x27;s endangered species list. In Australia, minor direct mortality of native animal populations from 1080 baits is regarded as acceptable by the regulatory bodies, compared to the predatory and competitive effects of those introduced species being managed using 1080. 1080 is also used by the agricultural industry to destroy populations of Dingos, Australia&#x27;s only pre-colonial mammalian apex predator, a practice condemned by numerous conservation groups and wildlife experts around the continent due to its far-reaching destabilisation of the natural balance of the ecosystem.

Western Shield is a project to boost populations of endangered mammals in south-west Australia conducted by the Department of Environment and Conservation of Western Australia. The project entails distributing fluoroacetate-baited meat from the air to kill predators. Wild dogs and foxes will readily eat the baited meat. Cats pose a greater difficulty as they are generally not interested in scavenging. However, an Australian RSPCA-commissioned study criticized 1080, calling it an inhumane killer. Some Western Australian herbivores (notably, the local subspecies of the tammar wallaby, &quot;Macropus eugenii derbianus&quot;, but not the subspecies &quot;M. e. eugenii&quot; of southern Australia and &quot;M. e. decres&quot; on Kangaroo Island) have, by natural selection, developed partial immunity to the effects of fluoroacetate, so that its use as a poison may reduce collateral damage to some native herbivores specific to that area.

In 2011, over 3,750 toxic baits containing 3 ml of 1080 were laid across 520 properties over between the Tasmanian settlements of Southport and Hobart as part of an ongoing attempt at the world&#x27;s biggest invasive animal eradication operation – the eradication of red foxes from the island state. The baits were spread at the rate of one per 10 hectares and were buried, to mitigate the risk to non-target wildlife species like Tasmanian devils. Native animals are also targeted with 1080. During May 2005 up to 200,000 Bennett&#x27;s wallabies on King Island were intentionally killed in one of the largest coordinated 1080 poisonings seen in Tasmania.

In 2016, PAPP (para-amino propiophenone) became available for use, which the RSPCA has endorsed as an alternative to 1080, due in part to its ability to kill faster and cause less suffering, as well as having an antidote, which 1080 does not. However, , 1080 was still being used in attempts to reduce feral cat populations.

=== New Zealand ===
Worldwide, New Zealand is the largest user of sodium fluoroacetate. This high usage is attributable to the fact that, apart from two species of bat, New Zealand has no native land mammals, and some of those that have been introduced have had devastating effects on vegetation and native species.
1080 is used to control possums, rats, stoats, deer, and rabbits. The largest users, despite some vehement opposition, are OSPRI New Zealand and the Department of Conservation.

=== United States ===
Sodium fluoroacetate is used in the United States to kill coyotes. Prior to 1972 when the EPA cancelled all uses, sodium fluoroacetate was used much more widely as a cheap predacide and rodenticide; in 1985, the restricted-use &quot;toxic collar&quot; approval was finalized.

=== Other countries ===
1080 is used as a rodenticide in Mexico, Japan, Korea, and Israel. In Israel 0.05% sodium fluoroacetate whole wheat grain baits are used to prevent heavy crop loss to field crops during mass outbreaks of the field rodents &quot;Microtus guentheri, Meriones tristrami&quot; and &quot;Mus musculus&quot; populations.

== Environmental impacts ==
=== Water ===
Because 1080 is highly water-soluble, it will be dispersed and diluted in the environment by rain, stream water, and ground water. Sodium fluoroacetate at the concentrations found in the environment after standard baiting operations will break down in natural water containing living organisms, such as aquatic plants or micro-organisms. Water-monitoring surveys, conducted during the 1990s, have confirmed that significant contamination of waterways following aerial application of 1080 bait is possible, but unlikely. Research by NIWA showed that 1080 deliberately placed in small streams for testing was undetectable at the placement site after 8 hours, as it washed downstream. Testing was not done downstream.

In New Zealand, surface water is routinely monitored after aerial application of 1080, and water samples are collected immediately after application, when there is the highest possibility of detecting contamination. Of 2442 water samples tested in New Zealand between 1990 and 2010, following aerial 1080 operations: 96.5% had no detectable 1080 at all and, of all the samples, only six were equal to, or above the Ministry of Health level for drinking water, and none of these came from drinking water supplies. Of 592 samples taken from human or stock drinking supplies, only four contained detectable 1080 residues at 0.1ppb (1 sample) and 0.2 ppb (3 samples) – all well below the Ministry of Health level of 2 ppb.

In an experiment funded by the Animal Health Board and conducted by NIWA simulating the effects of rainfall on 1080 on a steep soil-covered hillside a few meters from a stream, it was found that 99.9% of the water containing 1080 leached straight into the soil (See 4.3 of) and did not flow over the ground to the stream as had been expected. The experiment also measured contamination of soil water, which was described as the water carried through the soil underground at short horizontal distances (0.5-3m), downhill toward the stream. The experiment did not measure contamination of deeper soil and ground water immediately beneath the site of application.

=== Soil ===
The fate of 1080 in the soil has been established by research defining the degradation of naturally occurring fluoroacetate (Oliver, 1977). Sodium fluoroacetate is water-soluble, and residues from uneaten baits leach into the soil where they are degraded to non-toxic metabolites by soil microorganisms, including bacteria (&quot;Pseudomonas&quot;) and the common soil fungus (&quot;Fusarium solani&quot;) (David and Gardiner, 1966; Bong, Cole and Walker, 1979; Walker and Bong, 1981).

=== Birds ===
Although it is now infrequent, individual aerial 1080 operations can still sometimes affect local bird populations if not carried out with sufficient care. In New Zealand, individuals from 19 species of native birds and 13 species of introduced birds have been found dead after aerial 1080 drops. Most of these recorded bird deaths were associated with only four operations in the 1970s that used poor-quality carrot baits with many small fragments. On the other hand, many native New Zealand bird populations have been successfully protected by reducing predator numbers through aerial 1080 operations. Kōkako, blue duck, New Zealand pigeon, kiwi, kaka, New Zealand falcon, tomtit, South Island robin, North Island robin, New Zealand parakeets (kākāriki), and yellowhead have all responded well to pest control programmes using aerial 1080 operations, with increased chick and adult survival, and increases in population size. In contrast, seven of 38 tagged kea, the endemic alpine parrot, were killed during an aerial possum control operation on the West Coast in August 2011. Because of their omnivorous feeding habits and inquisitive behaviour, kea are known to be particularly susceptible to 1080 poison baits, as well as other environmental poisons like the zinc and lead used in the flashings of backcountry huts and farm buildings. Recent research found that proximity to human-occupied sites where kea scrounge human food is inversely related to survival; the odds of survival increased by a factor of 6.9 for remote kea compared to those that lived near scrounging sites. High survival in remote areas is explained by innate neophobia and a short field-life of prefeed baits, which together preclude acceptance of poison baits as familiar food.

=== Reptiles and amphibians ===
Reptiles and amphibians are susceptible to 1080, although much less sensitive than mammals. Amphibian and reptile species that have been tested in Australia are generally more tolerant to 1080 poison than are most other animals. McIlroy (1992) calculated that even if lizards fed entirely on insects or other animals poisoned with 1080, they could never ingest enough poison to receive a lethal dose. Laboratory trials in New Zealand simulating worst-case scenarios indicate that both &quot;Leiopelma archeyi&quot; (Archey&#x27;s frog) and &quot;L. hochstetteri&quot; (Hochstetter&#x27;s frog) can absorb 1080 from contaminated water, substrate, or prey. The chance of this occurring in the wild is ameliorated by a variety of factors, including frog ecology. Captive maintenance and contamination problems rendered parts of this study inconclusive. Further population monitoring is recommended to provide more conclusive evidence than provided by this single study. In New Zealand, the secondary poisoning of feral cats and stoats following 1080 operations is likely to have a positive effect on the recovery of native skink and gecko populations. Killing rabbits and possums, which compete for food with skinks and geckos, may also have benefits.

=== Fish ===
Fish generally have very low sensitivity to 1080. Toxicity tests have been conducted in the US on bluegill sunfish, rainbow trout, and the freshwater invertebrate &quot;Daphnia magna&quot;. Tests at different 1080 concentrations on sunfish (for four days) and &quot;Daphnia&quot; (two days) showed that 1080 is &quot;practically non-toxic&quot; (a US EPA classification) to both these species. Rainbow trout were also tested over four days at four concentrations ranging from 39 to 170 mg 1080 per litre. From these results an LC50 (the concentration of 1080 per litre of water which theoretically kills 50% of the test fish) can be calculated. The LC50 for rainbow trout was calculated to be 54 mg 1080/litre – far in excess of any known concentration of 1080 found in water samples following 1080 aerial operations. Thus 1080 is unlikely to cause mortality in freshwater fish.

=== Invertebrates ===
Insects are susceptible to 1080 poisoning. Some field trials in New Zealand have shown that insect numbers can be temporarily reduced within 20 cm of toxic baits, but numbers return to normal levels within six days of the bait being removed. Other trials have found no evidence that insect communities are negatively affected. Another New Zealand study showed that wētā, native ants, and freshwater crayfish excrete 1080 within one to two weeks. There is also evidence that 1080 aerial operations in New Zealand can benefit invertebrate species. Both possums and rats are a serious threat to endemic invertebrates in New Zealand, where around 90 per cent of spiders and insects are endemic and have evolved without predatory mammals. In a study on the diet of brushtail possums, 47.5 per cent of possum faeces examined between January 1979 and June 1983 contained invertebrates, mostly insects. One possum can eat up to 60 endangered native land snails (&quot;Powelliphanta&quot; spp.) in one night.

<doc id="1190115" wikidata="Q610191" url="?curid=1190115" title="Imagining Argentina (film)">
<text>Imagining Argentina is a 2003 drama historical film written and directed by British playwright Christopher Hampton and starring Antonio Banderas, Emma Thompson, Leticia Dolera and Rubén Blades. It is based on the award-winning eponymous 1987 novel by American writer Lawrence Thornton. It was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 2003 Venice Film Festival.

The film is centered on a couple living through the oppressive last military dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983) and the Dirty War it conducted. Graphic images of suffering, such as rape and torture, are depicted. The closing caption states that a total of nearly 30,000 Argentines were &quot;disappeared&quot; through this period. The film was a joint USA/Argentina/Spain/UK production.

== Plot synopsis ==
During the last civil-military dictatorship in Argentina, the military government conducts what was known as a Dirty War against opponents, abducting and often murdering those opposed to its rule. Cecilia, a dissident journalist living in Buenos Aires, is kidnapped by the secret police to join the ranks of the disappeared. She had earlier published a challenging article in her outrage over the forced disappearance of students protesting the bus fares.

As her husband Carlos, a theatre director, begins to search frantically for her, he realizes that he has acquired psychic power that enables him to predict the future. Carlos is sought after by others who have lost loved ones. This power helps Carlos foresee what happens to his wife and other detainees. At one point, Carlos visits the Naval Mechanics School, revealed as a notorious center of torture and murder of detainees.

== Cast ==
* Antonio Banderas as Carlos Rueda
* Emma Thompson as Cecilia Rueda
* Leticia Dolera as Teresa Rueda, Carlos and Cecilia&#x27;s daughter
* Maria Canals as Esme Palomares
* Rubén Blades as Silvio Ayala
* Mariana Seligmann as Guzman Tochter
* Irene Escolar as Eurydice
* Andreas Tang as himself
* Kuno Becker as Gustavo Santos, a warden
* Anton Lesser as General Guzmán
* Marzenka Novak as Sasha

== Reception ==
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 31% based on reviews from 13 critics, with an average rating of 4.30/10. Metacritic calculated an average score of 27 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Peter Bradshaw for &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote:&quot;well, what can I say about something destined to be a cult classic of awfulness? Imagining Argentina is an excruciatingly misjudged attempt to impose a layer of occult spirituality on an important political subject... The spectacle of Banderas exercising his sensitive magic powers, intercut with Thompson getting horribly raped and beaten - with close-ups on her droll, quizzical face contorted in agony - is truly wince-making&quot;.

<text>Adamantane is an organic compound with formula C10H16 or, more descriptively, (CH)4(CH2)6. Adamantane molecules can be described as the fusion of three cyclohexane rings. The molecule is both rigid and virtually stress-free. Adamantane is the most stable isomer of C10H16. The spatial arrangement of carbon atoms in the adamantane molecule is the same as in the diamond crystal. This similarity led to the name &quot;adamantane&quot;, which is derived from the Greek &quot;adamantinos&quot; (relating to steel or diamond). It is a white solid with a camphor-like odor. It is the simplest diamondoid.

The discovery of adamantane in petroleum in 1933 launched a new field of chemistry dedicated to the synthesis and properties of polyhedral organic compounds. Adamantane derivatives have found practical application as drugs, polymeric materials, and thermally stable lubricants.

==History and synthesis==
In 1924, H. Decker suggested the existence of adamantane, which he called decaterpene.

The first attempted laboratory synthesis was made in 1924 by German chemist Hans Meerwein using the reaction of formaldehyde with diethyl malonate in the presence of piperidine. Instead of adamantane, Meerwein obtained 1,3,5,7-tetracarbomethoxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione: this compound, later named Meerwein&#x27;s ester, was used in the synthesis of adamantane and its derivatives. D. Bottger tried to obtain adamantane using Meerwein&#x27;s ester as precursor. The product, tricyclo-[3.3.1.13,7], was not adamantane, but a derivative.

Other researchers attempted to synthesize adamantane using phloroglucinol and derivatives of cyclohexanone, but also failed.
Adamantane was first synthesized by Vladimir Prelog in 1941 from Meerwein&#x27;s ester. With a yield of 0.16%, the five-stage process was impractical (simplified in the image below). The method is used to synthesize certain derivatives of adamantane.
Prelog&#x27;s method was refined in 1956. The decarboxylation yield was increased by the addition of the Hunsdiecker pathway (11%) and the Hoffman reaction (24%) that raised the total yield to 6.5%. The process was still too complex, and a more convenient method was found in 1957 by Paul von Ragué Schleyer: dicyclopentadiene was first hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst (e.g. platinum dioxide) to give tricyclodecane and then transformed into adamantane using a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium chloride) as another catalyst. This method increased the yield to 30–40% and provided an affordable source of adamantane; it therefore stimulated characterization of adamantane and is still used in laboratory practice. The adamantane synthesis yield was later increased to 60% and 98% by ultrasound and superacid catalysis. Today, adamantane is an affordable chemical compound with a cost of one or two USD per gram.
All the above methods yield adamantane as a polycrystalline powder. Using this powder, single crystals can be grown from the melt, solution, or vapor phase (e.g. with the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique). Melt growth results in the worst crystalline quality with a mosaic spread in the X-ray reflection of about 1°. The best crystals are obtained from the liquid phase, but the growth is impracticably slow – several months for a 5–10 mm crystal. Growth from the vapor phase is a reasonable compromise in terms of speed and quality. Adamantane is sublimed in a quartz tube placed in a furnace, which is equipped with several heaters maintaining a certain temperature gradient (about 10 °C/cm for adamantane) along the tube. Crystallization starts at one end of the tube, which is kept near the freezing point of adamantane. Slow cooling of the tube, while maintaining the temperature gradient, gradually shifts the melting zone (rate ~2 mm/hour), producing a single-crystal boule.
==Natural occurrence==
Adamantane was first isolated from petroleum by the Czech chemists S. Landa, V. Machacek, and M. Mzourek. They used fractional distillation of petroleum. They could produce only a few milligrams of adamantane, but noticed its high boiling and melting points. Because of the (assumed) similarity of its structure to that of diamond, the new compound was named adamantane.

Petroleum remains a source of adamantane; the content varies from between 0.0001% and 0.03% depending on the oil field and is too low for commercial production.

Petroleum contains more than thirty derivatives of adamantane. Their isolation from a complex mixture of hydrocarbons is possible due to their high melting point and the ability to distill with water vapor and form stable adducts with thiourea.

==Physical properties==
Pure adamantane is a colorless, crystalline solid with a characteristic camphor smell. It is practically insoluble in water, but readily soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. Adamantane has an unusually high melting point for a hydrocarbon. At 270 °C, its melting point is much higher than other hydrocarbons with the same molecular weight, such as camphene (45 °C), limonene (−74 °C), ocimene (50 °C), terpinene (60 °C) or twistane (164 °C), or than a linear C10H22 hydrocarbon decane (−28 °C). However, adamantane slowly sublimes even at room temperature. Adamantane can be distilled with water vapor.

===Structure===

As deduced by electron diffraction and X-ray crystallography, the molecule has Td symmetry. The carbon–carbon bond lengths are 1.54 Å, almost identical to that of diamond. The carbon–hydrogen distances are 1.112 Å.

At ambient conditions, adamantane crystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure (space group Fm3m, &quot;a&quot; = 9.426 ± 0.008 Å, four molecules in the unit cell) containing orientationally disordered adamantane molecules. This structure transforms into an ordered, primitive, tetragonal phase (&quot;a&quot; = 6.641 Å, &quot;c&quot; = 8.875 Å) with two molecules per cell, either upon cooling to 208 K or pressurizing to above 0.5 GPa.

This phase transition is of the first order; it is accompanied by an anomaly in the heat capacity, elastic, and other properties. In particular, whereas adamantane molecules freely rotate in the cubic phase, they are frozen in the tetragonal one; the density increases stepwise from 1.08 to 1.18 g/cm3, and the entropy changes by a significant amount of 1594 J/(mol·K).

===Hardness===
Elastic constants of adamantane were measured using large (centimeter-sized) single crystals and the ultrasonic echo technique. The principal value of the elasticity tensor, C11, was deduced as 7.52, 8.20, and 6.17 GPa for the &lt;110&gt;, &lt;111&gt;, and &lt;100&gt; crystalline directions. For comparison, the corresponding values for crystalline diamond are 1161, 1174, and 1123 GPa. The arrangement of carbon atoms is the same in adamantane and diamond; however, in the adamantane solid, molecules do not form a covalent lattice as in diamond, but interact through weak van der Waals forces. As a result, adamantane crystals are very soft and plastic.

===Spectroscopy===
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of adamantane consists of two poorly resolved signals, which correspond to sites 1 and 2 (see picture below). The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are respectively 1.873 and 1.756 ppm and are 28.46 and 37.85 ppm. The simplicity of these spectra is consistent with high molecular symmetry.

Mass spectra of adamantane and its derivatives are rather characteristic. The main peak at &quot;m&quot;/&quot;z&quot; = 136 corresponds to the ion. Its fragmentation results in weaker signals as &quot;m&quot;/&quot;z&quot; = 93, 80, 79, 67, 41 and 39.

The infrared absorption spectrum of adamantane is relatively simple because of the high symmetry of the molecule. The main absorption bands and their assignment are given in the table:

* Legends correspond to types of oscillations: δ – deformation, ν – stretching, ρ and ω – out of plane deformation vibrations of CH2 groups.

===Optical activity===
Adamantane derivatives with different substituents at every nodal carbon sites are chiral. Such optical activity was described in adamantane in 1969 with the four different substituents being hydrogen, bromine, methyl, and carboxyl. The values of specific rotation are small and are usually within 1°.

==Nomenclature==
Using the rules of systematic nomenclature, adamantane is called tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decane. However, IUPAC recommends using the name &quot;adamantane&quot;.
The adamantane molecule is composed of only carbon and hydrogen and has Td symmetry. Therefore, its 16 hydrogen and 10 carbon atoms can be described by only two sites, which are labeled in the figure as 1 (4 equivalent sites) and 2 (6 equivalent sites).

Structural relatives of adamantane are noradamantane and homoadamantane, which respectively contain one less and one more CH2 link than the adamantane.

The functional group derived from adamantane is adamantyl, formally named as 1-adamantyl or 2-adamantyl depending on which site is connected to the parent molecule. Adamantyl groups are a bulky pendant group used to improve the thermal and mechanical properties of polymers.

==Chemical properties==
===Adamantane cations===
The adamantane cation can be produced by treating 1-fluoro-adamantane with SbF5. Its stability is relatively high.

The dication of 1,3-didehydroadamantane was obtained in solutions of superacids. It also has elevated stability due to the phenomenon called &quot;three-dimensional aromaticity&quot; or homoaromaticity. This four-center two-electron bond involves one pair of electrons delocalized among the four bridgehead atoms.
===Reactions===
Most reactions of adamantane occur via the 3-coordinated carbon sites. They are involved in the reaction of adamantane with concentrated sulfuric acid which produces adamantanone.
The carbonyl group of adamantanone allows further reactions via the bridging site. For example, adamantanone is the starting compound for obtaining such derivatives of adamantane as 2-adamantanecarbonitrile and 2-methyl-adamantane.

====Bromination====
Adamantane readily reacts with various brominating agents, including molecular bromine. The composition and the ratio of the reaction products depend on the reaction conditions and especially the presence and type of catalysts.
Boiling of adamantane with bromine results in a monosubstituted adamantane, 1-bromadamantane. Multiple substitution with bromine is achieved by adding a Lewis acid catalyst.

The rate of bromination is accelerated upon addition of Lewis acids and is unchanged by irradiation or addition of free radicals. This indicates that the reaction occurs via an ionic mechanism.

====Fluorination====
The first fluorinations of adamantane were conducted using 1-hydroxyadamantane and 1-aminoadamantane as initial compounds. Later, fluorination was achieved starting from adamantane itself. In all these cases, reaction proceeded via formation of the adamantane cation which then interacted with fluorinated nucleophiles. Fluorination of adamantane with gaseous fluorine has also been reported.

====Carboxylation====
Carboxylation of adamantane with formic acid gives 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid.
====Oxidation====
1-Hydroxyadamantane is readily formed by hydrolysis of 1-bromadamantane in aqueous solution of acetone. It can also be produced by ozonation of the adamantane: Oxidation of the alcohol gives adamantanone.
====Others====
Adamantane interacts with benzene in the presence of Lewis acids, resulting in a Friedel–Crafts reaction. Aryl-substituted adamantane derivatives can be easily obtained starting from 1-hydroxyadamantane. In particular, the reaction with anisole proceeds under normal conditions and does not require a catalyst.

Nitration of adamantane is a difficult reaction characterized by moderate yields. A nitrogen-substituted drug amantadine can be prepared by reacting adamantane with bromine or nitric acid to give the bromide or nitroester at the 1-position. Reaction of either compound with acetonitrile affords the acetamide, which is hydrolyzed to give 1-adamantylamine:
==Uses==
Adamantane itself enjoys few applications since it is merely an unfunctionalized hydrocarbon. It is used in some dry etching masks and polymer formulations.

In solid-state NMR spectroscopy, adamantane is a common standard for chemical shift referencing.

In dye lasers, adamantane may be used to extend the life of the gain medium; it cannot be photoionized under atmosphere because its absorption bands lie in the vacuum-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Photoionization energies have been determined for adamantane as well as for several bigger diamondoids.

===In medicine===
All medical applications known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative used as a drug was amantadine – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains of influenza and then to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, bromantane (bromantan), carmantadine, chlodantane (chlodantan), dopamantine, gludantan (gludantane), hemantane (hymantane), idramantone (kemantane), memantine, nitromemantine rimantadine, saxagliptin, somantadine, tromantadine, and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.

Influenza virus strains have developed drug resistance to amantadine and rimantadine, which are not effective against prevalent strains as of 2016.

===In designer drugs===
Adamantane was recently identified as a key structural subunit in several synthetic cannabinoid designer drugs, namely AB-001 and SDB-001.

=== Spacecraft propellant ===

Adamantane is an attractive candidate for propellant in Hall-effect thrusters because it ionizes easily, can be stored in solid form rather than a heavy pressure tank, and is relatively nontoxic.

===Potential technological applications===
Some alkyl derivatives of adamantane have been used as a working fluid in hydraulic systems. Adamantane-based polymers might find application for coatings of touchscreens, and there are prospects for using adamantane and its homologues in nanotechnology. For example, the soft cage-like structure of adamantane solid allows incorporation of guest molecules, which can be released inside the human body upon breaking the matrix. Adamantane could be used as molecular building blocks for self-assembly of molecular crystals.

==Adamantane analogues==
Many molecules and ions adopt adamantane-like cage structures. Those include phosphorus trioxide P4O6, arsenic trioxide As4O6, phosphorus pentoxide P4O10 = (PO)4O6, phosphorus pentasulfide P4S10 = (PS)4S6, and hexamethylenetetramine C6N4H12 = N4(CH2)6. Particularly notorious is tetramethylenedisulfotetramine, often shortened to &quot;tetramine&quot;, a rodenticide banned in most countries for extreme toxicity to humans. The silicon analogue of adamantane, sila-adamantane, was synthesized in 2005. Arsenicin A is a naturally occurring organoarsenic chemical isolated from the New Caledonian sea sponge &quot;Echinochalina bargibanti&quot; and is the first known heterocycle to contain multiple arsenic atoms.

Conjoining adamantane cages produces higher diamondoids, such as diamantane (C14H20 – two fused adamantane cages), triamantane (C18H24), tetramantane (C22H28), pentamantane (C26H32), hexamantane (C26H30), etc. Their synthesis is similar to that of adamantane and like adamantane, they can also be extracted from petroleum, though at even much smaller yields.

<doc id="1190130" wikidata="Q887153" url="?curid=1190130" title="J. Caleb Boggs">
<text>James Caleb Boggs (May 15, 1909 – March 26, 1993) was an American lawyer and politician from Claymont, Delaware. A Republican, he was commonly known by his middle name, Caleb, frequently shortened to Cale.

He was a veteran of World War II, and a member of the Republican Party, who served three terms as U.S. Representative from Delaware, two terms as Governor of Delaware, and two terms as U.S. Senator from Delaware. He lost re-election in 1972 to then–New Castle County councilman and future President of the United States Joe Biden.

==Early life and education==
Boggs was born on May 15, 1909, at Cheswold, Delaware, the son of Edgar Jefferson and Lettie Vaughn Boggs. Boggs joined the Delaware National Guard in 1926 and became a reserve officer that year.

=== Family ===
In 1931, he married Elizabeth Muir; the couple had two children, and were members of the Methodist Church.

=== Education ===
He graduated from the University of Delaware in 1931 with an A.B. degree and later graduated from Georgetown Law School in 1937 with an LLB degree.

== Career ==
In 1938, he was admitted to the Delaware State Bar Association and began the practice of law at Dover, Delaware.

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army with the 6th Armored Division fighting in Normandy, the Rhineland, the Ardennes, and central Europe. He earned five Campaign Stars, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Croix de Guerre with palm from France.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Boggs was appointed Associate Judge of the Family Court of New Castle County in 1946. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946, defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Philip A. Traynor. He won the election a total of three times, also defeating Democrats J. Carl McGuigan in 1948, and Henry M. Winchester in 1950. Boggs served in the U.S. House from January 3, 1947, to January 3, 1953.

===Governor of Delaware===

Boggs was elected Governor of Delaware in 1952, defeating incumbent Democratic Governor Elbert N. Carvel, and won a second term in 1956, defeating Democrat J. H. Tyler McConnell. He served as governor from January 20, 1953, to December 30, 1960, when he resigned because of his upcoming U.S. Senate term. On April 2, 1958, he signed the bill that ended capital punishment in Delaware.

===U.S. Senate===

Boggs was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1960, narrowly defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator J. Allen Frear Jr. by 1.4 percentage points, and becoming the only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator that year. He was again elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966, defeating Democrat James M. Tunnell Jr., son of the former U.S. Senator. He served two terms from January 3, 1961, to January 3, 1973. Boggs voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Boggs lost his bid for a third term in 1972 to the future 47th Vice President and 46th President, Democrat Joe Biden, then a New Castle County councilman. Boggs was a reluctant candidate that year, being persuaded to run only to help avoid a divisive primary election. Biden waged an energetic campaign, questioning Boggs&#x27;s age and ability, and went on to defeat Boggs by approximately 1.4 percentage points. In his last years, Boggs lived in Wilmington, Delaware, where he continued to practice law until retiring in the early 1980s.

==Death and legacy==
Boggs&#x27; health declined in his final years due to diabetes and cancer. His wife, Elizabeth, died on April 1, 1992, and he died just under a year later, on March 26, 1993, at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. He is buried in the Old Presbyterian Cemetery in Dover, on the grounds of the Delaware State Museum. 

The J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building at 844 King Street in Wilmington, Delaware is named for him.

<doc id="1190131" wikidata="Q1571030" url="?curid=1190131" title="The Yorkshire Post">
<text>The Yorkshire Post is a daily broadsheet newspaper, published in Leeds, Yorkshire, England. It primarily covers stories from Yorkshire, although its masthead carries the slogan &quot;Yorkshire&#x27;s National Newspaper&quot;. It was previously owned by Johnston Press and is now owned by National World. Founded in 1754, it is one of the oldest newspapers in the country.

The paper&#x27;s head office is in Whitehall Road, Leeds and the current editor is James Mitchinson. It considers itself &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most trusted and historic newsbrands.&quot;

==History==
The paper was founded in 1754, as the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot;, making it one of Britain&#x27;s first daily newspapers. The &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; was a weekly newspaper until it was purchased by a group of Conservatives in 1865 who set up the Yorkshire Conservative Newspaper Company Limited then published daily under the current name.

The first issue of &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;, on 2 July 1866, included the following statement:

The newspaper broke the story of the Edward VIII abdication crisis under the editorship of Arthur Mann. In 1939, &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; absorbed a rival, the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot;, which was founded in 1718 and was liberal in comparison to the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; from the late 18th century, and under the editorship of Edward Baines and his son (also named Edward Baines). At its peak in the 1950s, &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; sold 120,000 copies a day. This figure had dropped to 40,000 by 2012, rising to nearer 90,000 on a weekend. By the second half of 2017, it was selling less than 22,000 copies a day, and circulation further declined to just 18,534 for the period January to June 2019. As well as publishing regular supplements on sport, rural affairs, culture and motoring it runs an extensive business section with two weekly pull-out supplements.

In 2012, as its parent company Johnston Press sought to cut costs, it was merged with the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; – the local newspaper for the Leeds city region - with the then editor, Peter Charlton, overseeing both titles. The merger saw the formation of combined departments for news, business, sport and features – with correspondents writing for both titles.

In February 2012 Johnston Press announced that printing of the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; and &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; in Leeds would be switched to their plant at Dinnington near Sheffield and the Leeds printing facility closed.

In September 2013, it was announced the Wellington Street premises would be demolished. Journalists had already vacated the building. Preliminary demolition began in March 2014, while in April 2014 it was announced the tower would be spared.

In March 2014, &#x27;The&#x27; was reintroduced on the name of the paper after 46 years.

&quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; achieved wider attention during the 2019 general election campaign, following the publication of a story about a boy being treated on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary which was published by sister title the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. The papers faced criticism on social media and in correspondence from readers, and editor James Mitchinson wrote an open letter to a reader defending the titles and their journalism.

<text>Annopol is a town in south-eastern Poland, located in Kraśnik County in Lublin Voivodeship, in the historic region of Lesser Poland. Annopol has an area of , and as of June 2022 it has 2,335 inhabitants.

==History==

Annopol received town rights in 1761, lost them in 1870 and regained on 1 January 1996. Its coat of arms shows St. Anna, the patron saint of the town (the name means &quot;Anna&#x27;s city&quot;, from Greek &quot;polis&quot;). It owes its picturesque location to the Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula.

Jews began to settle in the town in the early 1600s. 73% of the town&#x27;s population was Jewish by 1921.

Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939, Annopol was occupied by Germany until 1944. During the Holocaust, a ghetto was created by the Germans. Jews from nearby villages and smaller towns, as well as from Kalisz and Łódź, were displaced to the Annopol ghetto. Jews from the ghetto were sent to the forced labor camps in nearby Rachów and Janiszów. The ghetto was liquidated on October 15, 1943 and most of the Jews were murdered at the Belzec extermination camp.

The history of Annopol is inextricably linked to that of Annopol-Rachów village close by, often combined as one and the same in written records.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship.

==Transport==
Annopol does not have a rail station, but the town is placed along national road 74, which goes from Piotrków Trybunalski to the Ukrainian border at the village of Zosin. Voivodeship roads 824 and 854 also pass through the town. The Vistula river road bridge at Annopol was built in 1967.

<text>Esham Attica Smith (born September 20, 1973), known mononymously as Esham, is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. Emerging as one of the first ever hip hop artists from Detroit, Esham released his debut studio album, &quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot;, in 1989 at the age of 16. Since then, he has gone on to release 21 full-length studio albums in total and is best known as a representative of the hip hop subgenre horrorcore. In 1992, he co-founded the horrorcore group Natas. He and his brother James Smith founded and ran the Detroit hip hop label Reel Life Productions.

As one of the first rappers to receive attention in the city, Esham was often cited as a major influence on another Detroit horrorcore act, Insane Clown Posse. Esham is known for incorporating elements of rock music in his beats, and his lyrics cover a number of subjects, including death, drug use, evil, paranoia and sex. Esham refers to his style of music as &quot;acid rap&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born Esham Attica Smith on September 20, 1973, in Long Island, New York, Esham grew up splitting time between the Seven Mile neighborhood on the East side of Detroit, Michigan, where he lived with his mother. He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as The Sugarhill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, &quot;He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought I could bring something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn&#x27;t really a [rap] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating what everybody else was doing.&quot; In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.

At the age of 16, Smith released his debut album, &quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot;, in 1989. Of the album, Smith stated, &quot;It was the crack era, [...] and that&#x27;s where all that really came from. It was all an expression about [&#x27;70s-&#x27;80s drug cartel] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred to the streets of Detroit as &#x27;Hell&#x27; on that record. So that&#x27;s where my ideas came from.&quot; In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label Reel Life Productions, which reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham&#x27;s albums because of his heavy metal influences.

In 1991, Esham met Joseph Bruce, a member of the group Inner City Posse, who praised Esham and Reel Life Productions, and gave Esham a copy of the group&#x27;s EP &quot;Dog Beats&quot;, beginning the two rappers&#x27; friendship and professional relationship.

After releasing two EPs, &quot;Erotic Poetry&quot; and &quot;Homey Don&#x27;t Play&quot;, Esham completed the double album &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, and its two volumes, &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot; were released separately on April 9, 1992. In &quot;All Music Guide to Hip-Hop&quot;, Jason Birchmeier wrote that &quot;Judgement Day, Vol. 1&quot; &quot;may not be his most well-crafted work, but it certainly stands as his most inspired work of the &#x27;90s&quot;, while &quot;Vol. 2&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t quite as strong as the first volume, suffering mostly from a number of weak tracks [...] the first volume doesn&#x27;t rely quite so much on cheap shock, instead focusing on evocative horror motifs, making &quot;Judgement Day, Vol. 2&quot; the less important of the two.&quot;

===&quot;KKKill the Fetus&quot;, &quot;Closed Casket&quot; and &quot;Dead Flowerz&quot;===
As a student at Osborn High School, Esham met Mastamind, who gave him a three-song demo tape of his music, leading the two to form the group Natas with Esham&#x27;s longtime friend, TNT. In 1992, Esham appeared on &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot;, the debut album of Insane Clown Posse, released on October 18. He produced three tracks and rapped on the album&#x27;s final track. In November, Natas released their debut album, &quot;Life After Death&quot;. Following the release of this album, Esham, Natas and Reel Life Productions were the subject of much controversy when a 17-year-old fan killed himself while smoking cannabis and playing Russian roulette while listening to &quot;Life After Death&quot;. In 1993, Esham released his third solo album, &quot;KKKill the Fetus&quot;. Jason Birchmeier wrote that &quot;At this point in his career, his rapping has already reached near-peak levels, and his production shows a continued path towards an inventiveness. [...] Never again would Esham be so gritty.&quot;

On November 22, 1994, Esham released his fourth studio album, &quot;Closed Casket&quot;. Jason Birchmeier wrote that &quot;most fans taking a chronological approach to his catalog should be fairly numb to Esham&#x27;s exploitative shock attempts. Yet if this is one of your first experiences with Esham the Unholy, this album should pack a punch with its dark nature.&quot; In May 1996, Esham released his fifth studio album, &quot;Dead Flowerz&quot;. It peaked at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

===Gothom Records (1997–2001)===
In June 1997, Esham rebranded Reel Life Productions as Gothom Records, and released the album &quot;Bruce Wayne: Gothom City 1987&quot;, which charted at number 57 on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Esham later signed a distribution deal with Overcore, a subsidiary of Overture Music, which later became distributed by TVT Records. In June 2001, Gothom released Kool Keith&#x27;s &quot;Spankmaster&quot; album, which featured several contributions by Esham, as well as Smith&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Tongues&quot;, which peaked at number seven on the Top Independent Albums chart, number 46 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 195 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In August 2001, Esham and D12 were kicked off the Warped Tour after members of the group allegedly physically attacked Smith over the lyrics of his song &quot;Chemical Imbalance&quot;, which contained a reference to the daughter of D12 member Eminem, who was not present during the tour.

===Psychopathic Records (2002–2005)===
In 2002, Esham signed to Psychopathic Records, releasing the compilation &quot;Acid Rain&quot;. It was announced that Esham would be moving away from the horror themes of his previous efforts. On November 18, 2003, Esham released his ninth studio album, &quot;Repentance&quot;. It peaked at No. 9 on the Top Heatseekers chart, No. 10 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and No. 71 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier wrote that &quot;&quot;Repentance&quot; is a small step forward for Esham. He seems very confident here, comfortable with himself as an artist [...] when he pulls everything together [...] he makes some of the best music of his long, fruitful, yet largely unacknowledged career.&quot;

In 2005 Esham joined forces with Insane Clown Posse and Lavel to release the Soopa Villainz album, Furious.

His follow-up album on Psychopathic &quot;A-1 Yola&quot;, saw Esham achieving his highest consecutive level of charting success, as it peaked at 176 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, his highest selling album on that chart to date, as well as peaking at No. 6 on Top Heatseekers, No. 12 on the Independent Albums chart, No. 23 on the Top Rap Albums chart, and No. 48 on the Top R&amp;B chart. Allrovi wrote, &quot;During the course of &quot;A-1 YOLA&quot;, Esham takes the form of street hustler, kingpin, vampire, and all sorts of underworld characters, injecting his undiluted personality into each three-to-four-minute sketch. His sonic backdrop remains raw but fresh, drawing an impressive amount of energy out of sparse beats.&quot;

Following this release, Esham left Psychopathic in 2005 to relaunch Reel Life/Gothom.

===Post-Psychopathic===

Smith released his twelfth studio album, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot; on August 3, 2010, followed by the album &quot;DMT Sessions&quot;, and a documentary directed by Smith, &quot;Death of an Indie Label&quot; in 2011, which was originally announced as a bonus feature on a deluxe edition of &quot;DMT Sessions&quot;, but was instead uploaded onto Gothom Inc.&#x27;s YouTube channel. The Documentary was released with a soundtrack entitled the same, the LP would feature Seven the General as well as Poe Whosaine. Smith was interviewed for the documentary &quot;The Untold Story of Detroit Hip-Hop&quot;, which is being produced by Detroit rapper Champtown. He also attempted a run for mayor of Detroit.

In 2012, MTV published a story detailing Esham&#x27;s feud with Eminem and Insane Clown Posse. In 2015 Esham and Insane Clown Posse reconciled their differences and Esham performed at the 2016 Juggalo Day &quot;Ringmaster&quot; Show.

==Style==
Esham&#x27;s lyrical style, which author Sara Cohen says &quot;utilize[s] shocking (and blatantly over the top) narratives to give an over-exaggerated, almost cartoon-like version of urban deprivation in Detroit&quot;, was derived from the style of the Geto Boys. Smith&#x27;s lyrics have focused on themes such as death, drug use, evil, paranoia and sex, and have included references to Satan. Smith refers to his performance style as &quot;acid rap&quot;, comparing the lyrics to hallucinations induced by LSD. Esham&#x27;s style has also been described as horrorcore hip hop.

People were literally scared of my records. There have been so many rumors about me and my records. People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They&#x27;d get into an accident and be like, &#x27;I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people&#x27;s heads. It wasn&#x27;t to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples&#x27; attention. [...] We said a lot of things that people wanted to say but didn&#x27;t say. We talked about a lot of political and social [issues] that people didn&#x27;t want to talk about.

Following accusations of Satanism, Smith decided that &quot;Closed Casket&quot; would be the last album to feature such themes, and that he would no longer rap about the Devil. According to Smith, &quot;I&#x27;ve been able to entertain people for 20 years. I just try to uplift people now. The latest things I do, I&#x27;m trying to get a message out to people, while I&#x27;m entertaining them at the same time.&quot;

Esham&#x27;s music style has been described as a fusion of hip hop beats and death metal lyrics. Esham defined his style as analogous to &quot;modern-day blues [or] heavy metal&quot;. Insane Clown Posse has frequently cited Esham as an influence on their music.

<doc id="1190151" wikidata="Q1022290" url="?curid=1190151" title="Kafue">
<text>Kafue is a town on the T2 road in the Lusaka Province of Zambia and it lies on the north bank of the Kafue River, after which it is named. It is the southern gateway to the central Zambian plateau on which Lusaka and the mining towns of Kabwe and the Copperbelt are located.

== Site ==

Kafue is at the south-eastern foot of a range of granite hills rising 200 m and extending over an area of about 250 km², and occupies a shelf of land between the hills and the river, just high enough to avoid its annual flood. The town extends along some shallow valleys between the hills. A 400 m wide strip of small farms and gardens separates the town from a bend of the river which is about 300 m wide in the dry season and 1.3 km wide in the rainy season, sometimes inundating a floodplain 10 km wide on the opposite bank, which consequently is uninhabited save for a few small villages or farms on higher ground.

==History==
During World War II, 25 Polish refugees escaping from German- and Soviet-occupied Poland, were admitted in Kafue in 1941.

== Transport links==
The Kafue River&#x27;s 50 km wide floodplain, the Kafue Flats, is a 240 km long east-west barrier to road and rail connections between the centre of the country and the south. Kafue lies at the eastern end of the floodplain where the river enters the Kafue Gorge and flows down the Zambezi Escarpment into the middle Zambezi rift valley. Consequently, it&#x27;s strategically located at the only place where north-south road and rail can easily cross the Kafue River and squeeze through the gap between floodplain and escarpment. The Kafue Railway Bridge on the Lusaka–Livingstone line is at the south end of the town, and the Kafue Bridge 9 km to south-east carries one of the busiest sections of the T2 road across the river and brings it through the town, from where it continues 50 km north to Lusaka. In the other direction the road connects to the Zimbabwe border at the Chirundu Bridge, and the main southern highway to Livingstone, Botswana and Namibia branches off it just south of the Kafue Bridge.

The river is not used for commercial water transport. To the west it is too shallow and meandering and does not go near any centres of population, to the east is not navigable due to the Kafue Gorge and dam. However, subsistence fishing and recreational boating and sports fishing takes place on a 60 km stretch of the river above the dam.

== Population ==
According to the 2010 Zambia Census of Population and Housing, Kafue has a total population of 219,000 of which 108,939 are males and 110,061 are females.

== Religion ==
Among people aged 15 years and above, 73.11% are Protestant, 11.08% belong to other religions, and 15.80% are not affiliated with any religion.

== Industry ==
Agriculture and fishing are the traditional occupations of the area, and a commercial farming area extends along the edge of the Kafue Flats for 35 km north-west of the town. Commercial fishing operations of any size are limited to fish farming. Kafue has a larger proportion of manufacturing industries compared to most of the towns outside the Copperbelt Province.The Town has an industrial estate with housing and services called Kafue Estates. The industries in Kafue include;
* Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia (Agricultural fertilisers)
* Bata Tannery (shoe leather) - No longer operational.
* Textiles - Kafue Textiles - No longer operational.
* UNIVERSAL Mining and Chemical Industries Limited (UMCIL), Kafue integrated Iron and Steel plant (Direct Reduced Iron). Phase one of the project was completed in 2007 and is now fully operational, producing 7,000 tonnes of finished rolled iron and steel products per month for the local and regional markets.
* Lee Yeast Zambia - The Sole manufacturer of baking yeast (and other baking products) in Zambia.
* Alliance Ginnery Zambia - Cotton Ginning company.
* Fens Zambia - Manufacturer of spray race equipment and commercial trailers.
* Kafue River Cliff - A modern 4 star Hotel located on the banks of the Kafue River operated by the LSA group.
Other industries in or near the town:
* Kafue Fisheries Ltd was first established in 1981 with a five hectare project pilot scheme. Over the years, the project has grown to its present size of 60 hectare ponds and is situated in the centre of 1800 hectare wildlife and cattle scheme. The whole aquaculture system is based on an integrated pig and fish enterprise with annual production of Tilapia exceeding 700 tonnes and 4000 pigs of the ‘heavy hog’ class.
* Kafue Quarry produces construction aggregate for road building and general construction. The firm has been together with Nitrogen Chemicals and Kafue Textiles (no longer in operation) a source of employment for the district for a number of years.
* Kafue Gorge Upper Power Station ( generation capacity) operated by the Zambia Electricity Supply Company (ZESCO) generates hydroelectricity downstream from the town, and at the end of the rainy season its reservoir extends back to the town.

<text>The Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad was a narrow-gauge passenger-carrying shortline railroad between East Boston and Lynn, Massachusetts, from 1875 to 1940. Part of the railroad&#x27;s right of way now forms the outer section of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority&#x27;s Blue Line rapid transit service.

==History==

The railroad was chartered May 23, 1874, and opened July 29, 1875. A ferry connection from its southern terminus at East Boston connected to Rowes Wharf in the city of Boston proper, with a connection to the Atlantic Avenue Elevated (from 1901 to 1938). The railroad followed the coastline north-eastward through the resort of Revere Beach to the far terminus at Lynn. A branch split at Orient Heights to a loop through Winthrop.

The rail laid was light, 30-pound per yard (15 kg/m) rail being installed at first, increased to 50 lb/yd (25 kg/m) in 1885 and 60 lb/yd (30 kg/m) in 1904. It was, however, laid from the beginning on standard gauge-sized ties. Given the lightweight rail, the locomotives were small and of narrow gauge dimensions. The vast majority of them were Mason Bogies, 11 from the Mason Machine Works and a further 21 from other builders after Mason closed. Cars were of narrow gauge dimensions, seating four across.

Between 1896 and 1900, the section from Revere Beach to Point of Pines, formerly running along the beach, was relocated inland to lie next to the Eastern Railroad&#x27;s abandoned Chelsea Beach Branch. The stations were moved and a new one (Bath House) was built. Revere Beach Boulevard was built later along the former route.

Revere Beach became a very popular resort, and the entire line was double-tracked by 1903. The Narrow Gauge Hotel burned in 1902. The 1904 Independence Day celebration included a staged collision between two obsolete Boston and Maine locomotives, and the rowdy crowds caused the town to cancel the Pines Hotel liquor license. 1906 festivities included a large papier-mâché structure which would spew a cloud of souvenir post cards with smoke and flashing lights as &quot;the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius&quot;. Commodore Perry&#x27;s flagship USS was burned offshore as a tourist attraction in 1908. Theodore Roosevelt spoke from the Pines Hotel during his 1912 presidential campaign as a &quot;Bull Moose&quot; candidate. The Pines Hotel closed in 1913 after a police raid discovered unlicensed liquor sales. The Boston American flying exhibition of July 1914 attracted large crowds. Six passenger cars were purchased by the East Broad Top Railroad in 1916; three were sold again in 1942, while three remain in use.

The railroad was highly successful, carrying commuters into Boston and the Boston urban population to the seaside resorts. By 1914 over seven million passengers were carried annually, making it one of the most heavily traveled stretches of railroad in North America. With such a traffic density, the expense of electrification could be easily recouped. By 1928, all existing cars were fitted with electric motors, trolley poles, and control stands and the steam locomotives were disposed of. However, the number of riders decreased during the Great Depression and completion of the Sumner Tunnel between East Boston and downtown Boston in 1934 allowed automobiles to compete with the ferries.

After attempts to find a buyer fell through, the BRB&amp;L filed for bankruptcy in 1937. A September 1938 hurricane destroyed of overhead wire and damaged the East Boston terminal. Further losses of ridership followed, and in 1939 the management petitioned for abandonment. After a railfan excursion train on 15 October the abandonment petition was granted, and the railroad ceased operations on January 27, 1940.

===Winthrop sections===
On July 1, 1891, the BRB&amp;L merged with the narrow gauge Boston, Winthrop and Shore Railroad. The BW&amp;S was itself a consolidation on December 12, 1883 of the Boston, Winthrop and Point Shirley Railroad and Eastern Junction, Broad Sound Pier and Point Shirley Railroad.

====Boston, Winthrop and Point Shirley Railroad====
The BW&amp;PS was organized on July 3, 1876 and opened a narrow gauge line on June 7, 1877. This line split from the BRB&amp;L at Winthrop Junction and headed east and south for to Winthrop Center and extended in stages during the following years. In 1881, the part heading south was closed and a new line was built east to Ocean Spray and south to Short Beach.

====Eastern Junction, Broad Sound Pier and Point Shirley Railroad====
The EJBSP&amp;PS was chartered in 1880 and built a standard gauge railway line from the Eastern Railroad near Crescent Beach southeast via Beachmont and Winthrop Beach to Point Shirley. South of Ocean Spray, this was just east of the BW&amp;PS. Much of this shared section of right-of-way used a three-rail, dual-gauge track. A branch of the EJBSP&amp;PS was also constructed in Revere, from the junction with the Eastern Railroad north to Point of Pines, parallel with the Eastern&#x27;s Chelsea Beach line. The EJBSP&amp;PS was not operated until 1884, by which time it had been absorbed into the Boston, Winthrop &amp; Shore RR. It operated for only two summers before being abandoned due to damage from storms.

====Post-merger====
The BW&amp;PS and the EJBSP&amp;PS, along with the Boston &amp; Winthrop (a &quot;paper railroad&quot; proposed but never built) were merged late in 1883 and operated thereafter as the Boston, Winthrop &amp; Shore RR. In 1885, after a storm, sections of line were abandoned, and the management of the BRB&amp;L stepped in. A circuit or loop line was constructed in 1888 and existed until the 1940 demise of the BRB&amp;L. It used parts of the original alignment of the BW&amp;PS. Most of the line, however, was built brand new, serving Winthrop Highlands, Winthrop Center and Winthrop Beach. The loop was double-tracked in 1903.

====Point Shirley Street Railway====

The Point Shirley Street Railway was built from Winthrop Beach station to Point Shirley beginning in August 1910 and opened later that year. The single-track line ran along Shirley Street and Tafts Avenue. The BRB&amp;L acquired the entire line with legislative approval in October 1912. By 1914, the line operated 30,594 car miles (an average of 35 daily round trips), carried 165,037 passengers (an average of 452 daily), and employed seven people.

Unusually, the Point Shirley Street Railway did not operate with electric power from overhead lines. It first used a gasoline-powered electric streetcar, then a battery-powered streetcar owned by the BRB&amp;L, but these did not prove adequate for reliable service and by early 1919 buses were used instead. This prompted a public outcry with demands for conventional overhead-powered cars; instead, the BRB&amp;L introduced two lighter battery-powered streetcars with better performance to the line in May 1919.

Even the 1919-built cars proved to be too expensive to operate on a marginal low-traffic line. In 1928, they were permanently replaced by buses.
===After closure===

Worth $2 million immediately after electrification, the railroad was sold to a scrap dealer for $118,756. The tracks were removed and the catenary structures cut down for scrap value. The passenger cars failed to be sold at auction and were burnt in mid-1940 to retrieve their metal components. The motorized trucks were sold to the Eastern Mass. Most former stations were demolished shortly after abandonment or during rapid transit conversion. Thornton, moved and converted to a house when the line was double-tracked in 1903, is reportedly still extant. In addition, Harbor View, closed earlier than the rest of the line and moved slightly from its original location, remains as a private residence.

====Bus service====
Upon abandonment of the BRB&amp;L, Lynn–Boston passengers were served by existing Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway (Eastern Mass) bus service and Boston and Maine Railroad rail service. Revere–Boston passengers were served by Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) streetcars connecting to the East Boston Tunnel; the company also operated a Revere Beach–Point of Pines bus service for two months. Winthrop–Boston bus service was operated by Saugus Transit (later Rapid Transit Inc.). Saugus Transit initially operated Winthrop–Lynn bus service under a temporary permit. On April 2, 1940, this service was split in two with a forced transfer at Point of Pines: Revere-based Service Bus Lines continued to operate Winthrop–Point of Pines, while the Lynn-based Eastern Mass operated Lynn–Point of Pines as part of a new Lynn–Boston route.

In January 1941, the Eastern Mass bought the Lynn terminal and a section of right of way for use as a busway. After the Eastern Mass relocated its bus terminal to Central Square, the company no longer needed the land and it was fragmented into commercial properties.

====Blue Line====

In 1941, the BERy bought the BRB&amp;L right of way from Day Square to Revere Beach for use as a high-speed trolley line similar to the Ashmont–Mattapan High-Speed Line; these plans were delayed by the onset of World War II. However, the 1926 &quot;Report on Improved Transportation Facilities&quot; and 1945–47 &quot;Coolidge Commission Report&quot; recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the BBRB&amp;L route rather than using it for a trolley line.

In 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.) decided to build to Lynn as a rapid transit line, and construction began in October 1948. The first part of the Revere Extension opened to Orient Heights on January 5, 1952, with intermediate stations at Airport and Day Square, and to Suffolk Downs on April 21, 1952. The second phase (cut short due to limited funds, and possibly due to the Eastern Massachusetts wielding its influence to protect its business in Lynn) opened to Wonderland on January 19, 1954 with intermediate stations at Beachmont and Revere Beach. All stations from Orient Heights to Wonderland were located at the sites of former BRB&amp;L stations. The line was renamed as the Blue Line in 1965.

Although recommended and studied several times since, further Blue Line extension to Lynn has not moved past the proposal stage. The former right of way from Revere Street to Point of Pines is owned by the Massachusetts Electric Company, a National Grid subsidiary, and used as a utility corridor. Most of its length is covered in brush or wetlands, although several residential buildings and parking areas incur on the utility-owned right of way in Point of Pines. The Alternatives Analysis / Draft Environmental Impact Statement, released in 2011, considered two potential routes: one following the Narrow Gauge right of way through Point of Pines, and one sharing the Newburyport/Rockport Line right of way.

====Winthrop====
The Winthrop Loop was not preserved for transit use; some stations were destroyed within weeks. Much of the right of way is owned by the town, including the sections used for Veterans Road and Walden Street as well as a baseball field near Fort Banks and the embankment through Crystal Cove. Other sections were reused for housing and commercial developments; a short section near Argyle Street is a walking trail. During the 1990s, a short section of track was installed as a memorial to the line in Winthrop Center, and portions of the Crystal Cove embankment are still extant.

Unlike the main line, the Winthrop Loop was not paralleled by mainline railroads or Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) streetcar lines. The town of Winthrop rejected plans for BERy to provide bus service. Instead, Saugus Transit began operating Winthrop Beach - bus service as soon as the BRB&amp;L was abandoned; it was granted a permanent operating certificate under the name Rapid Transit Inc in March. The two routes split at Winthrop Beach and roughly paralleled the two halves of the Loop; a connecting service also operated through to Point Shirley.

Veterans Road was paved on the former right-of-way after World War II. The inbound terminus was changed to 1952-opened in May 1956. The MBTA, formed in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail operations, began funding bus services including the Winthop service in 1968.

In July 1991, Winthrop bus operations were transferred to Paul Revere Transportation. In September 1999, the two halves of the loop service were designated as 712 Winthrop - Orient Heights via Highlands and 713 Winthrop - Orient Heights via Center and added to MBTA maps and signage. Outbound route 712 trips are through-routed to inbound route 713 trips and vice versa; some service continues to operate to Point Shirley.

====Other sections====

The Orient Heights carhouse was repurposed as a casket factory. It was destroyed by a fire on March 15, 2019. The right of way from Byron Street to Tomahawk Drive was acquired by the Massachusetts Port Authority for the expansion of Logan Airport. The right of way through Jeffries Point is privately owned; the tunnels are intact, though their north ends are buried. Part of the right-of-way between Logan Airport and the Blue Line section was used for a U.S. Navy oil pipeline in the 1950s.

General Electric acquired most of the right of way through Lynn for expansion of the River Works plant during World War II, likely as settlement for debt still owed on the electrification project. GE later sold off its sections: one piece to a private developer in 1989, the piece near Commercial Street to the MBTA in 1991 (part of which was later sold to the same developer), and the western section to a different developer in 2014. New England Power Company (also a National Grid subsidiary) maintains an easement through the western section for electrical transmission lines.
==Station listing==
===Winthrop Loop===
This is going clockwise around the loop. The loop tracks split from the main line just north of Orient Heights, turned east and then split with one direction heading east and the other south. Much of the rail&#x27;s path was converted to roads when the line was removed, but you can still see some of the existing railbed that curved out into Crystal Cove at Winthrop Beach Station, and the remnants of the rail bridges as it crossed Belle Isle March to connect at Orient Heights. Today, one can drive along Veteran&#x27;s Road (current path of the old line) to experience the course of the commuter train as it ran parallel to Shirley Street. The location of the various railway stations in Winthrop had a tremendous influence on the pattern of Winthrop&#x27;s suburban growth; business and commerce grew up naturally around these stations and ultimately into what would become today&#x27;s neighborhoods.

<doc id="1190160" wikidata="Q345564" url="?curid=1190160" title="Howard Cannon">
<text>Howard Walter Cannon (January 26, 1912 – March 5, 2002) was an American politician from Nevada. Elected to the first of four consecutive terms in 1958, he served in the United States Senate from 1959 to 1983. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in St. George, Utah, Cannon graduated from Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona Law School. In 1940, Cannon won his first election as county attorney for Washington County, Utah. The following year with the start of World War II, Cannon served in the United States Army for a year and then in the United States Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1946, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Cannon later served in the Army Air Forces Air Reserve as a major general.

In 1949, Cannon returned to politics, winning election as city attorney for Las Vegas, Nevada. After four consecutive terms in that office, Cannon defeated Republican incumbent U.S. Senator George W. Malone in the 1958 election. As senator, Cannon chaired multiple committees, including the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on Rules and Administration. Cannon also sponsored the Airline Deregulation Act, a bill signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 that lowered airfares through deregulation of the airline industry.

Cannon&#x27;s final Senate term was mired in a scandal after the revelation of a 1979 meeting with Teamsters union president Roy Lee Williams where Cannon was offered a bribe to block the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. The scandal contributed to Cannon losing re-election in 1982 to Republican challenger Chic Hecht. After leaving the Senate, Cannon remained in Washington as an aviation and defense consultant for nearly a decade before retiring to Las Vegas in the mid-1990s.

==Early life and education==
Cannon was born in St. George, Utah. His grandfather, David Cannon, was the younger brother of George Q. Cannon and a leading figure in the building of the St. George Temple, who was later the third president of that temple. His father Walter Cannon was one of David Cannon&#x27;s 31 children. Howard&#x27;s parents Walter Cannon and Leah Sullivan married in 1909. When Cannon was two years old his father left for England to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for two years.

Cannon went to Woodward School in St. George, close enough to his home he could walk home for lunch. He then went to Dixie High School. During summers, he worked as a bell hop at the North Rim Lodge along the Grand Canyon. In the evenings he would form a small band where he used his skills as a saxophonist to entertain guests. He delivered copies of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; around St. George on horseback.

He graduated from Dixie Junior College (now Utah Tech University) and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music education from Arizona State Teachers College (now Northern Arizona University) in 1933. He then received an LL.B. from the University of Arizona Law School in 1937. While studying at the University of Arizona he was the director of the university pep orchestra. Between the summer of his second and third year he directed this group at a hotel in Seattle, Washington. In the summer of 1936 after his graduation he directed an orchestra of four, performing on the SS Jefferson on a cruise from Seattle, Washington, to Yokohama, Japan. Also during his law school years Cannon competed in rodeos and learned to be an airplane pilot.

Also in the summer of 1936, Cannon began dating Dorothy Pace of Alamo, Nevada. They married on December 21, 1945.

After he finished law school he returned to St. George. Among his actions on his return was buying a house adjacent to Dixie College as an investment property.

==Legal career==
Cannon became a lawyer after passing the bar exams in Arizona (1937), Utah (1938) and Nevada (1946). He served as a reference and research attorney for the Utah State Senate in 1939, and won election as county attorney of Washington County, Utah in 1940.

In 1946 Cannon established law offices in Las Vegas. In 1949 he was elected Las Vegas City Attorney, and he served four consecutive terms.

==Military service==
During World War II, Cannon served as a troop carrier pilot in the United States Army Air Corps and its subsequent incarnation as the United States Army Air Forces. Assigned to the European theater, he dropped paratroopers at Saint-Come-du-Mont, Normandy and during the following combat mission in September 1944 was shot down over the Netherlands. He spent 42 days trying to return to the Allied lines with the assistance of the Dutch underground. Released from active duty in 1946, he joined the Army Air Forces Reserve until 1947 when he transitioned to the Air Force Reserve concurrent with the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service. Continuing to fly in the Air Force Reserve, he achieved command pilot status and ultimately retired from the Air Force Reserve with the rank of major general. His military decorations included the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, the Purple Heart and the Air Medal (three awards).

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
In 1956, Cannon ran for the U.S. House of Representatives to succeed Republican incumbent C. Clifton Young, who ran for the U.S. Senate, but lost the Democratic primary to former Congressman Walter Baring, who then won the general election. In 1958, he was elected to the United States senate, unseating Republican Senator George W. Malone with 58% of the vote. Cannon was nearly defeated in his first re-election bid in 1964, holding off Republican Lieutenant Governor Paul Laxalt in one of the closest Senate elections ever. On election night, one of the networks actually projected that Cannon had lost, but several precincts did not report in until the next morning and gave Cannon enough votes to secure a second term. Ultimately, Cannon only won by 48 votes. He likely would have lost without Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s presence atop the ticket. Johnson easily carried the state as part of his 44-state landslide that year. Cannon was re-elected with far less difficulty in 1970 by defeating Washoe County District Attorney William Raggio. He also won re-election easily over former Representative David Towell in 1976.

In the early 1980s, Cannon was ensnared in a scandal when Teamsters President Roy Lee Williams was indicted by federal prosecutors for attempting to bribe Cannon in exchange for using his influence to block the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, a bill deregulating the trucking industry. He testified that he did not know Williams or his associates and denied being offered a bribe, but other witnesses corroborated the story, and Williams was convicted. Cannon was challenged in the 1982 Democratic primary by U.S. Representative Jim Santini and won winning by about 4,500 votes but lost the general election to Republican nominee Chic Hecht, a former state senator and businessman.

===Tenure===

In 1964, Cannon voted for the Civil Rights Act. He also helped increase funding for Nellis Air Force Base, turning Nellis into one of the most important military facilities worldwide. Cannon also introduced the Airline Deregulation Act, a bill signed in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter that stopped the federal government from regulating airfare and airline routes. Deregulation led to lower air fares and contributed to the growth of Las Vegas as a tourist destination.

A Govtrack analysis of his votes from 1977 to 1982 rates Cannon as a moderate. Americans for Democratic Action, an organization that has long issued 100-point &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; scores to members of Congress, rated Cannon a 69 in 1965, 41 in 1971, 30 in 1977, and 50 in 1982. The American Conservative Union (ACU) often rated Cannon as unfavorable to conservative causes in its 100-point scale, such as 20 in 1972 and 29 in 1981. However, the ACU scored more Cannon favorably in some years: 50 in 1971, 100 in 1978, and 59 in 1982.

In 1981, he won the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.

In 1980 he took a familiarisation ride in the SR71 Blackbird. (http://www.sr71.us/pg011.htm)

===Committee assignments===
He had an interest in the rules and administration of the Congress, serving as chairman of several committees on that subject, including the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and Committee on Rules and Administration. He chaired the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation from 1978 to 1981.

==Post-political life==
After leaving Congress in 1983, Cannon remained in Washington as a defense and aviation consultant for 11 years.

On February 2, 1988, President Ronald Reagan nominated Cannon to the inaugural Board of Trustees of the Goldwater Scholarship program. The U.S. Senate confirmed Cannon by unanimous consent on March 3, 1988.

On March 5, 2002, Cannon died at age 90 in a Las Vegas hospice due to congestive heart failure; he was previously diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Honors==
* The passenger terminal at Reno-Tahoe International Airport is named after him.
* The Cannon Center for Survey Research is named after him.
* The Howard W. Cannon Aviation Museum, located in Las Vegas&#x27;s McCarran International Airport, is also named after him.

<doc id="1190166" wikidata="Q1446529" url="?curid=1190166" title="Eskorbuto">
<text>Eskorbuto was a Spanish punk rock band from Santurtzi, Greater Bilbao, Basque Autonomous Community, that formed in 1980. They have been one of the most influential bands for Spanish and Latin American punk rock. They are known for their strong attitude and crude lyrics. They were one of the first bands to perform punk with lyrics in Spanish. Eskorbuto is a modified word taken from &quot;escorbuto&quot; (scurvy in Spanish).
Along with the band La Polla Records, Eskorbuto has been very influential in the Spanish rock and punk scene.

By 2015, Pako Galán announced that the band come back to performing again. In May 2016, the new line-up is presented with Ali Kalaña (bass and lead vocals) and Naty Penadas (guitar and backing vocals) and Pako as the only continuous member.

==Biography==

=== The beginning (1980–1983) ===
Born in Nervión, Santurtzi. Influence by the punk explosion of 1977 they started playing around 1980, the line up consisted of Iosu Expósito on guitar and vocals (declared fan of The Who, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones and the Sex Pistols) and Juanma Suarez on bass and vocals (who didn&#x27;t really listen to music) later to be joined by Pako Galán on drums. They gave their first concert in a school near their rehearsal space with the audience being a group of 10-year-olds.

In August 1982, the band went to Madrid to record their first demo. They did the trip in an old Fiat 124 that left Paco pulled up to Burgos, they thought of burning it but ultimately sold it for &quot;3000 pesetas&quot;. The trip paid off as they got signed by the independent label Spansuls Records where they recorded their first single. At that time the nascent punk movement in Spain based its subjects in the humor and messing around, but they decided to play about issues that were taboo and swept with their single: &quot;Mucha Policía, Poca Diversión&quot;, which contained the songs &quot;Mucha Policía, Poca Diversión&quot;, &quot;Mi Degeneración&quot; y &quot;Enterrado Vivo&quot;. The single was sold out in three months.

=== &quot;Zona Especial Norte&quot; and &quot;Eskizofrenia&quot; (1984–1985) ===
In the summer of 1983, they returned to Madrid to record a new demo, with the songs: &quot;E.T.A.&quot;, &quot;Escupe A La Bandera&quot;, &quot;Maldito País (España)&quot;, &quot;Iros A La Mierda&quot;. Suddenly, an event shook Eskorbuto&#x27;s destiny: they got arrested, the police listened to the demo and went on to accuse the band of insulting the state and its security forces. They got the emergency anti-terrorist law imposed on them, and held incommunicado for 36 hours. The attorney the band chose to defend them was Cristina Almeida; they received many calls of support, but none from the Basque Country.

While they were detained in Bilbao they collected signatures of support from all sides. Eskorbuto felt forgotten by the Pro-Amnesty Committees when their managers were arrested in Madrid for songs such as &quot;E.T.A.&quot; y &quot;Maldito País (España)&quot;.

They wrote 3 more songs: &quot;Ratas En Biskaia&quot;, &quot;Soldados&quot;, &quot;Dios, Patria Y Rey&quot;, recorded their first EP &quot;Zona Norte Especial&quot;, shared with the band RIP and released by the publisher Spansuls Records in 1984. Due to poor distribution, the EP was discontinued quickly. This EP caused them many problems. Due to the song &quot;A La Mierda El País Vasco&quot;, they were accused of being traitors, and earned them bad reputation in Basque nationalist and cultural circles.

In 1985, they released their first LP called &quot;Eskizofrenia&quot;, a début of new punk energy, released by the Madrid label &quot;Twins&quot;. The disc numbered 18 tracks composed between 1980 and 1984. Unfortunately the Twins label did little for it to succeed, and soon disappeared until 1987 when it was reissued by &quot;Discos Suicidas&quot; with a different cover. In the same year they staged a concert in Hernani, sharing the bill with La Polla Records and Cicatriz, who performed in the political campaign &quot;Martxa eta Borroka&quot;.

At that time Jose Mari Blasco coined the term &quot;Rock Radical Vasco&quot; and established the &quot;Soñua&quot; label, which began recording La Polla Records, Hertzainak y Barricada. Soñua offered Eskorbuto to form a part of Basque radical rock, something that would have opened all the doors in the Basque Country, and forgotten old moves but they refused. As they pointed, &quot;rock has no country, not even the Basque.&quot;

They then became cursed, they were censured in some stations and newspapers, and people became increasingly reluctant to hire them to play in the Basque Country, his exact words: &quot;We play more in the rest of Spain than in Euskadi&quot;, but they were never anti-Basques, they preferred to play on their land instead of having to travel to faraway concerts. As Iosu said, &quot;we never play &quot;A La Mierda El País Vasco&quot; in Spain, there we prefer to play &quot;Maldito País España&quot;&quot;. 

=== &quot;Anti Todo&quot; and breakthrough success (1986) ===
Once they rejected the offer from Soñua Records, they continued with their natural independence and promised to release three discs 1986, something that seemed impossible. They joined with &quot;Discos Suicidas Records&quot; and recorded their second LP in 25 hours titled &quot;Anti Todo&quot; and say that they were anti-everything, everyone is anti-everything, but they were not against everything. The title is most eloquently summed up in two words and attitude. This album was their masterpiece, it was not just another Punk-rock record, the term punk is too small for them musically. &quot;Anti Todo&quot; is considered an incredible rock album in which we find some of their best street poetry lyrics.

Soon they release a cassette enclosing a Fanzine. This cassette consisted of six tracks with the significant title &quot;Ya No Quedan Más Cojones, Eskorbuto A Las Elecciones&quot;. It must be said that the CSS tried to censor and refused to make the tape for the song &quot;Escupe A La Bandera&quot;, the cassette was an incredible success and sold out quickly.

Had not yet completed the year 1986 and still prepare another surprise, which nobody had done so far in this country: A live album. &quot;We do a lot of records because we plays a little bit, our albums are Live&quot;, they say. For direct recording of thought on a tour called Bloody Christmas, something that did not work, who knows whether out of laziness or lack of infrastructure. At the end of the assembly hall of a school in Santurce is the chosen location. For the release of this disc decided to sell the rights to the highest bidder contract with &quot;Discos Suicidas Records&quot; and this album would definitely strengthen the seal on the other hand aims intídducirse &quot;DRO Records&quot; in the Basque rock and after some give and take strips, Servando Carvallo of &quot;DRO Records&quot; offers a juicy offer: &quot;200,000 pesetas&quot; to renounce the contract with &quot;Discos Suicidas&quot; and &quot;100,000 pesetas&quot; to the group by the master. At the concert, Eskorbuto plays and recording their first live-album: &quot;Impuesto Revolucionario&quot; double LP, with a cover very expressive, a caricature of the three members of Eskorbuto by Niko from MCD.

=== New sounds, successes and struggles (1987–1990) ===
They began the tireless work of preparing another more ambitious and novel album. They surprised with another double album released by Discos Suicidas Records called &quot;Los Demenciales Chicos Acelerados&quot;. The 20 tracks that are part of this work form a &quot;Zarzuela Rock&quot; (punk rock opera). The sound was slower, more chaotic and full of rage. Aitor Amezaga played the keyboard on the album.

In 1988, out of the record companies, Eskorbuto decided to produce, edit and distribute their new album on their own label, Butoeskor Records. The result was &quot;Las más macabras de las vidas&quot;. From the cover to the letters of the subject, the theme of death is very present. It is an album full of anger, hopelessness, and disappointment.

=== Mexico Tour and &quot;Demasiados enemigos...&quot; (1991) ===
From this moment, heroin was becoming more prevalent in the lives of Iosu and Juanma and they were called less to play. In 1991, they went to Mexico to give two concerts in front of crowds of more than 8,000 people over two days. Just before leaving, Iosu was hospitalized and was replaced by Iñaki Speed, who was updated with the songs between the plane and the hotel. Earlier that year when nobody gave them a chance, the people of Castellón &quot;Matraka Diskak Records&quot; offered them the chance to record a new album thus silencing voices and rumors of the band&#x27;s dissolution and death to emerge with the album &quot;Demasiados Enemigos&quot; in late 1991.

=== Death of Iosu and Juanma (1992) ===
A few months after going out this album, during the follow-up promotional tour, in March 1992, Iosu left the band again because of health problems. After two months in hospital, Iosu Expósito died on May 31 of that same year. Pako and Juanma reformed Eskorbuto with the new singer/guitarist Urko Igartiburu and continued working on a new album, but five months later, in October, Juanma passed away.

=== Eskorbuto without Iosu and Juanma (1993–1999) ===
Pako with the work that had prepared with Juanma, decides to translate it into a new album: &quot;Akí No Keda Ni Dios&quot; published in 1994, dedicated to lost friends and bandmates, with songs that had been composed by Pako and Juanma before his death. Many fans of Eskorbuto deride this decision, Paco continued with the &quot;new&quot; Eskorbuto, in spite of the death of both charter members editing two more albums: &quot;Kalaña&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Dekadencia&quot;, in 1998. Then, in 1999 where the band are disbanded.

=== Reunion (2015–present) ===
Pako Galán announced by the official Eskorbuto page that he, Ali Kalaña (bassist on &quot;Kalaña&quot; and &quot;Dekadencia&quot;) and Naty Penadas (Penadas Por La Ley member) began to tour and record, with their first single &quot;Censurados&quot;, released in June 2016.

==Influence==
The group have influences of punk and rock bands including the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Vibrators, the Rolling Stones, the Who, ZZ Top and Motörhead.
Eskorbuto never emphasized their abilities as musicians. Nevertheless, they composed songs that quickly became hymns of the time, like &quot;Mucha policía, poca diversión&quot;. Their lyrics were loaded with rage and social content, and were a very controversial group. Never were aligned politically with any ideology saying, &quot;Rock does not have a mother country, not even the Basque&quot;.

Their relationship with other groups was not good, even with La Polla Records (for instance, they stole a guitar from them) and Kortatu (particularly with Fermín Muguruza). This caused a boycott on one or another of them, and the band halls had to choose to have Eskorbuto or La Polla Records, but not both together.

<doc id="1190181" wikidata="Q5118368" url="?curid=1190181" title="Chute (racecourse)">
<text>In horse racing, a chute is an extended path increasing the length of a straight portion of a racecourse, particularly an oval-shaped one, allowing races of a specified distance to start at a location other than on one of the turns.

For example, many racetracks in the United States are exactly in circumference; often such racetracks are symmetrical ovals, with both straightaways and both turns being precisely . Frequently, the finish line will be positioned exactly three-quarters of the way down the stretch; in that case, the point at which the first or &quot;clubhouse&quot; turn joins to the backstretch would be from the finish. In order to hold races at the distance of  – the most common distance of American thoroughbred horse races – the backstretch is extended by an extra . This is the most common situation where a chute is pressed into service. At some tracks, this chute is longer, so that races can be run at as well.

Often a second chute will be placed at the top of the stretch, extending the length of the straightaway from the top of the stretch to the finish line from to , thus allowing races to be run, and also make it possible for quarter horses to run races at distances of up to . At two tracks, Hialeah Park and Turf Paradise, the chute that begins at the top of the stretch is even longer, so that there is a distance of from the beginning of the chute to the wire; so-called &quot;baby races,&quot; or races for 2-year-olds run very early in the year, are started from this position.

Many tracks have a turf (grass) course inside of the main (dirt) track, most commonly measuring . This turf course will often be equipped with a chute of its own, extending diagonally from the stretch, to permit turf races to be run at the distance of . This diagonal chute can either consist of a more-or-less straight line, or may curve significantly, in a counterclockwise direction. In 2006 two tracks — Monmouth Park and Hollywood Park Racetrack — added a chute extending diagonally from the backstretch, to permit races at furlongs and 6 furlongs, respectively (the corresponding circumferences of these two tracks&#x27; turf courses being 7 furlongs and 1 mile plus 145 feet).

Some American racetracks have circumferences of more (or, generally in the case of minor-circuit tracks, less) than ; examples include Aqueduct, Arlington Park, Hollywood Park Racetrack and Saratoga, all of which are tracks, and Belmont Park, the country&#x27;s largest track, with a circumference. The backstretch chutes at Aqueduct and Arlington Park are long enough to permit races to be run at , while Saratoga&#x27;s chute is shorter, extending only to . Hollywood&#x27;s chute formerly allowed races, but when its finish line was moved forward in the late 1980s races could no longer be accommodated, and became the longest distance that could be run out of its chute (an unintended consequence of this was that by the mid-2000s dirt races had gained considerable popularity in the United States when such races had rarely if ever been run before at most tracks, even those where the track&#x27;s configuration made it possible to do so). At Belmont, the chute permits races at distances up to to be run (formerly up to , but this chute, which at one point crossed over the training track, was truncated in the late 1970s to eliminate the aforementioned cross-over, and today dirt races at Belmont actually start on the clubhouse turn, the only situation where races do this at any major American track). Belmont&#x27;s outer (Widener) turf course also contains two chutes which separate from the beginning of the backstretch at an angle; races at distances of and are started from these chutes.

Rarely, a &quot;half-chute&quot; will be employed; in this instance, the chute will branch off from a turn, usually the clubhouse turn, at the midway point of the turn, and extend to a position level with that of the homestretch, the chute thus joining to the turn at a 90-degree angle. Currently only one racetrack of note in the United States — Ellis Park Racecourse in Kentucky — makes use of such a chute, starting races from it at the distance of one mile (Ellis Park is a 1 mile [1,811 m] track). Formerly, Saratoga also had such a chute; it was known as the &quot;Wilson Mile&quot; chute, and like the one found at Ellis Park, it was used to start races. Use of the Wilson Mile chute was suspended in 1972; after being reinstated briefly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the chute itself was dismantled, and as a result, it is now no longer possible to run main-track (dirt) races at Saratoga at any distance longer than but shorter than . The &quot;all-weather&quot; (dirt) track at England&#x27;s Wolverhampton Racecourse has a similar chute, but it is used for 7-furlong races as the latter is a one-mile (1.6 km) track. The one-mile dirt oval at Tampa Bay Downs in Oldsmar, Florida also once had a similar chute which permitted races at 7 furlongs; however, this chute extended diagonally from the backstretch and not on a 90-degree angle. In 2004 Tampa Bay Downs&#x27; backstretch chute was lengthened to 7 furlongs, whereupon the diagonal chute was decommissioned; however, remnants of it are still intact. Laurel Park in Maryland also formerly had a diagonal chute, which allowed for races at up to 1 miles.

Perhaps America&#x27;s most distinctive horse racing chute is the El Camino Real Chute, located at Santa Anita. Added in 1953, this is a downhill turf chute consisting of a straight section, a right turn (unique in modern American horse racing), another straight section, and a long, sweeping left turn, before finally crossing over the dirt course and joining the turf oval. The chute was modeled to give the appearance of a European-type course. Grass sprints at about 6 furlongs (actual distance 64 feet less than same), as well as the marathon distance of about 1 miles (actual distance 262 feet less than same, and generally used only once a year for the San Juan Capistrano Invitational race), utilize the full length of the El Camino Real Chute. Turf races at 1 miles and 1 miles also start from various points within the chute, and races at 1 miles (a very common turf distance at American tracks) start directly on the dirt crossover. At 1 miles and longer, the horses are then required to go once around Santa Anita&#x27;s turf oval, which is somewhat larger and narrower than most turf courses situated inside one-mile dirt tracks (9/10ths of a mile, or 7 furlongs plus 132 feet; this is also the case at Golden Gate Fields racetrack in Albany, California).

<text>The early Germanic calendars were the regional calendars used among the early Germanic peoples before they adopted the Julian calendar in the Early Middle Ages. The calendars were an element of early Germanic culture.

The Germanic peoples had names for the months that varied by region and dialect, but they were later replaced with local adaptations of the Julian month names. Records of Old English and Old High German month names date to the 8th and 9th centuries, respectively. Old Norse month names are attested from the 13th century. As with most pre-modern calendars, the reckoning used in early Germanic culture was likely lunisolar. As an example, the Runic calendar developed in medieval Sweden was lunisolar, fixing the beginning of the year at the first full moon after winter solstice.

== Months ==
The Germanic calendars were lunisolar, the months corresponding to lunations. Tacitus writes in his &quot;Germania&quot; (Chapter 11) that the Germanic peoples observed the lunar months.

The lunisolar calendar is reflected in the Proto-Germanic term &quot;month&quot; (Old English , Old Saxon , Old Norse , and Old High German , Gothic ), being a derivation of the word for &quot;moon&quot;,  — which shares its ancestry with the Greek &quot;mene&quot; &quot;moon&quot;, &quot;men&quot; &quot;month&quot;, and Latin &quot;mensis&quot; &quot;month&quot;.

== Days and weeks ==
Tacitus gives some indication of how the Germanic peoples of the first century reckoned the days. In contrast to Roman usage, they considered the day to begin at sunset, a system that in the Middle Ages came to be known as the &quot;Florentine reckoning&quot;. The same system is also recorded for the Gauls in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic Wars&quot;.
:&quot;They assemble, except in the case of a sudden emergency, on certain fixed days, either at new or at full moon; for this they consider the most auspicious season for the transaction of business. Instead of reckoning by days as we do, they reckon by nights, and in this manner fix both their ordinary and their legal appointments. Night they regard as bringing on day.&quot;

The concept of the week, on the other hand, was adopted from the Romans, from about the first century, the various Germanic languages having adopted the Greco-Roman system of naming of the days of the week after the classical planets, inserting loan translations for the names of the planets, substituting the names of Germanic gods in a process known as &quot;.

== Calendar terms ==
The year was divided into a summer half and a winter half, as attested in Old English and medieval Scandinavian sources. In Scandinavia this continued after Christianization; in Norway and Sweden the first day of summer is marked by the (14 April) and the first day of winter by the Calixtus Day (14 October).

The month names do not coincide, so it is not possible to postulate names of a Common Germanic stage, except possibly the names of a spring month and a winter month, and . The names of the seasons are Common Germanic, , , , and for &quot;spring&quot; in north Germanic, but in west Germanic the term was used. The Common Germanic terms for &quot;day&quot;, &quot;month&quot; and &quot;year&quot; were , and . The latter two continue Proto-Indo-European , , while is a Germanic innovation from a root meaning &quot;to be hot, to burn&quot;.

A number of terms for measuring time can be reconstructed for the proto-Germanic period.

==Month names==

===Medieval===
Bede&#x27;s Latin work &quot;De temporum ratione&quot; (&quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;), written in 725, describes Old English month names. Bede mentions intercalation, the intercalary month being inserted around midsummer.

The following is an English translation of Bede&#x27;s Latin text:

&quot;It did not seem [right] to me that I should speak of other nations&#x27; observance of the year and yet be silent about my own nation&#x27;s.

In the old days the English people calculated their months according to the course of the moon. Hence, after the manner of the Greeks and the Romans, [the months] take their names from the Moon, for the Moon is called &quot;mona&quot; and the month &quot;monath&quot;.
The first month, which the Latins call January, is &quot;Ġiuli&quot;; February is called &quot;Solmonath&quot;; March &quot;Hrethmonath&quot;; April, &quot;Eosturmonath&quot;; May, &quot;Thrimilchi&quot;; June, &quot;Litha&quot;; July [is] also [called] &quot;Litha&quot;; August, &quot;Weodmonath&quot;; September, &quot;Helegmonath&quot;; October, &quot;Winterfilleth&quot;; November, &quot;Blodmonath&quot;; December, &quot;Ġiuli&quot; – the same name by which January is called.

They began the year on the 8th kalends of January [25 December], when we celebrate the birth of the Lord. That very night, which we hold so sacred, they used to call by the heathen word &quot;Modranecht&quot;, that is, &quot;mother&#x27;s night&quot;, because (we suspect) of the ceremonies they enacted all that night.

Whenever it was a common year, they gave three lunar months to each season. When a year with an embolismic month occurred (that is, one with 13 lunar months [instead of the usual 12]) they assigned the extra month to summer, so that three months together bore the name &quot;Litha&quot;; hence they called [the embolismic] year &quot;Thrilithi&quot;. It had four summer months, with the usual three for the other seasons. But originally, they divided the year as a whole into two seasons: summer and winter. They assigned the six months in which the days are longer than the nights to summer, and the other six to winter. Hence they called the month in which the winter season began &quot;Winterfilleth&quot;, a name made up from &quot;winter&quot; and &quot;full moon&quot;, because winter began on the full Moon of that month.

Nor is it irrelevant if we take the trouble to translate the names of the other months: The [two] months of &quot;Giuli&quot; derive their name from the day when the Sun turns back [and begins] to increase, because one of [these months] precedes [this day] and the other follows.
* &quot;Solmonath&quot; can be called &quot;month of cakes&quot;, which they offered to their gods in that month.
* &quot;Hrethmonath&quot; is named for their goddess Hretha, to whom they sacrificed at this time.
* &quot;Eosturmonath&quot; has a name which is now translated &quot;Paschal month&quot;, and which was once called after a goddess of theirs named &quot;Eostre&quot;, in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month. Now they designate that Paschal season by her name, calling the joys of the new rite by the time-honoured name of the old observance.
* &quot;Thrimilchi&quot; was so called because in that month the cattle were milked three times a day; such at one time, was the fertility of Britain or Germany, from whence the English nation came to Britain. &quot;Litha&quot; means &quot;gentle&quot; or &quot;navigable&quot;, because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle, and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea.
* &quot;Weodmonath&quot; means &quot;month of tares [weeds]&quot;, for they are very plentiful then.
* &quot;Helegmonath&quot; means &quot;month of sacred rites&quot;.
* &quot;Winterfilleth&quot; can be called by the invented composite name &quot;winter-full&quot;.
* &quot;Blodmonath&quot; is &quot;month of immolations&quot;, for then the cattle which were to be slaughtered were consecrated to their gods.
Good Jesu, thanks be to thee, who hast turned us away from these vanities and given us [grace] to offer to thee the sacrifice of praise.&quot;
Charlemagne (r. 768–814) recorded agricultural Old High German names for the Julian months.
These month- and seasonal-names remained in use, with regional variants and innovations, until the end of the Middle Ages across German-speaking Europe, and they persisted in popular or dialectal use into the 19th century.

The only agreement between the Old English and the Old High German (Carolingian) month names is the naming of April as &quot;Easter month&quot;. Both traditions have a &quot;holy month&quot;; however, it is the name of September in the Old English system and of December in the Old High German one.

A separate tradition of month names developed in 10th century Iceland, see #Icelandic calendar.

===Modern correspondences===
The Old High German month names introduced by Charlemagne persisted in regional usage and survive in German dialectal usage. The Latin month names were in predominant use throughout the medieval period, although the &quot;Summarium Heinrici&quot;, an 11th century pedagogical compendium, in chapter II.15 (&quot;De temporibus et mensibus et annis&quot;) advocates the use of the German month names rather than the more widespread Latin ones.

In the late medieval to early modern period, dialectal or regional month names were adopted for use in almanacs, and a number of variants or innovations developed, comparable to the tradition of &quot;Indian month names&quot; developed in American &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanacs&quot; in the early 20th century. Some of the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanacs&quot;&#x27; &quot;Indian month names&quot; are in fact derived from continental tradition.
The Old English month names fell out of use entirely, being revived only in a fictional context in the Shire calendar constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien for use in his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.


==Icelandic calendar==
A special case is the Icelandic calendar, developed in the 10th century: Inspired by the Julian calendar it introduced a purely solar reckoning with a year, having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of &quot;leap weeks&quot; instead of Julian leap days.

The old Icelandic calendar is not in official use anymore, but some Icelandic holidays and annual feasts are still calculated from it. It has 12 months, of 30 days broken down into two groups of six often termed &quot;winter months&quot; and &quot;summer months&quot;. The calendar is peculiar in that each month always start on the same day of week. This was achieved by having 4 epagomenal days to bring the number of days up to 364, and then adding a &quot;sumarauki&quot; week in the middle of summer of some years. This was eventually done so as to ensure that the &quot;summer season&quot; begins on the Thursday between 9 and 15 April in the Julian calendar.
Hence always starts on a Friday sometime between 8 and 15 January of the Julian calendar, always starts on a Sunday between 7 and 14 February of the Julian calendar.
:
Many of the months have also been used in Scandinavia, the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen wrote down the following months in his dictionary,
coming in this order:
:: &quot;Jolemåne&quot; &quot;Torre&quot; &quot;Gjø-Kvina&quot; 
Two of the names are identical to Iceland, and other is similar. They have developed differently in different regions. &quot;Þorri&quot; is pronounced &quot;tærri&quot;, &quot;torre&quot; and similar, and can mean both the moon after Yule-month, or be a name for January or February.

<text>ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited, commonly known as ComfortDelGro, is a multi-national transport group based in Singapore. It is listed on the Singapore Exchange and operates more than 40,000 vehicles across 13 countries. It was formed on 29 March 2003 through a merger of Singaporean land transport companies Comfort Group and DelGro Corporation.

On 17 September 2019, the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index listed ComfortDelGro on its index in recognition of its sustainability efforts, thus becoming the first transport company in Singapore as well as in Asia to do so.

== History ==
=== Comfort Group Limited ===
In May 1970, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) announced plans to provide a cooperative taxi and minibus service. The cooperative was aimed to target the problem of pirate or &quot;ali baba&quot; taxis which were rampant in Singapore at that time, and NTUC planned to get former pirate taxi drivers to drive the minibuses as part of the cooperative. The NTUC Co-operative Commonwealth for Transport Limited (&quot;COMFORT&quot; or &quot;NTUC Comfort&quot;) was hence formed by the NTUC as a social enterprise together with the affiliated NTUC Income and NTUC Welcome. Comfort started operations in 1971 started with a fleet of 1,000 taxis, with the first taxis entering service at the end of January that year.

In June 1993, NTUC Comfort was corporatised and renamed Comfort Transportation Pte Ltd. Comfort was subsequently listed on 6 June 1994 and became the Comfort Group Limited. The listed company was owned by Singapore Labour Foundation (41.7%), its owner-drivers as a single block (approximately 20%) and the public (35%).

At the time of the merger announcement in 2002, Comfort&#x27;s taxi business operated under the brand names of Comfort and Yellow Top with a combined fleet of approximately 11,340 taxis. It was Singapore&#x27;s largest private bus operator then with 401 buses on unscheduled routes. It also had a fleet of 730 taxis in China through joint ventures.

=== DelGro Corporation Limited ===
Singapore Bus Services Limited was established on 1 July 1973 to unify bus services in Singapore. The company was replaced by Singapore Bus Service (1978) Limited on 17 February 1978, which was then listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) on 26 June the same year.

By the 1990s, the company has diversified to other land transport businesses such as taxis, as well as property and engineering businesses. In 1992, the bus operations were reorganised under a new subsidiary SBS Bus Services Pte Ltd. The original parent company Singapore Bus Service (1978) Limited was renamed DelGro Corporation Limited on 12 November 1997, from the words &quot;Delta&quot; and &quot;Growth&quot;. On 10 December the same year, the bus subsidiary SBS Bus Services Pte Ltd was listed and renamed Singapore Bus Services Limited, before renaming again to SBS Transit in 2001.

Until 1995, SBS/DelGro&#x27;s taxi operations arm was Singapore Bus Service Taxi Pte Ltd (SBS Taxi Pte Ltd). CityCab was formed in 1995 with the merger of three companies – Singapore Airport Bus Service Ltd (SABS), SBS Taxi and Singapore Commuter Pte Ltd (a subsidiary of ST Automotive). CityCab then became DelGro&#x27;s new taxi operations arm and was jointly owned by DelGro and ST Automotive (later ST Kinetics).

At the time of the merger announcement in 2002, DelGro operated public bus services, taxis and car rental in Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Citycab operation ran 5,116 taxis, while SBS Transit was the largest scheduled bus operator in Singapore with 2,872 buses. DelGro had also just been awarded the operation of the North East MRT line and the Sengkang and Punggol light rail systems.

=== Merger ===
Comfort and DelGro&#x27;s merger was first proposed on 21 November 2002. In its joint announcement, the merger aimed to &quot;consolidate the transportation businesses of the Companies in order to enhance profitability and shareholder value&quot;. The merger was finalised on 29 March 2003.

The merger had a market capitalisation of over $1 billion, combined sales of $1.56 billion, and pre-tax earnings of $196 million. It set to provide a spectrum of transport services ranging from bus and taxi services to leasing and vehicle maintenance and inspections.

The new company&#x27;s only rival then was SMRT Corporation, which had a market capitalisation of around $930 million, sales of $500 million and pre-tax profits of $88.5 million then. The latter&#x27;s fleet of some 600 buses and 2,000 taxis was smaller, but it was operating Singapore&#x27;s rail network entirely.

<text>The Olney interpretation (also known as the Olney corollary or Olney declaration) was United States Secretary of State Richard Olney&#x27;s interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. During a border dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela, Olney claimed in 1895 that the Monroe Doctrine gave the United States authority to mediate border disputes in the Western Hemisphere. He extended the meaning of the Monroe Doctrine, which had previously stated merely that the Western Hemisphere was closed to additional European colonization: &quot;Today the United States is practically sovereign on this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition... 

The border dispute was settled by arbitration in 1897, and the Olney interpretation was defunct by 1933.

<text>Leo Walmsley (born Lionel Walmsley; 29 September 1892 – 8 June 1966) was an English writer. Walmsley was born in Shipley, West Riding of Yorkshire, but brought up in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay in the North Riding. Noted for his fictional &quot;Bramblewick&quot; series, based on Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, he fought in the Royal Flying Corps, later the Royal Air Force, in the First World War, being awarded the Military Cross.

==Life==
He was born Lionel Walmsley, at 7 Clifton Place, Shipley in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1892. Two years later, his family moved to Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay on the coast of present-day North Yorkshire, where he was schooled at the old Wesleyan chapel and the Scarborough Municipal School. He was the son of the painter James Ulric Walmsley (1860–1954) who studied under Stanhope Forbes in Cornwall before settling in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

During the First World War he served as an observer with the Royal Flying Corps in East Africa, was mentioned in dispatches four times and was awarded the Military Cross. After a plane crash he was sent home, and after some time teaching at the school in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, eventually pursued a literary career. After the war he left Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay to work in London where he met his first wife. Following the end of the marriage he returned to live at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay then moved to Wales after the outbreak of World War II. Following the end of his second marriage, he moved to the area of Fowey, Cornwall, where he settled at Pont Pill near Polruan, where he became friendly with the writer Daphne du Maurier.

Walmsley was married three times. He married Elsie Susanna Preston in 1919, divorcing her in 1932. Then, in 1933, he married Margaret Bell Little, divorcing her around 1946. His final marriage was to Stephanie Gubbins, in 1955.

Many of Walmsley&#x27;s books are mainly autobiographical, the best known being his &quot;Bramblewick&quot; series set in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, with Whitby appearing as &quot;Burnharbour&quot;. His most notable works were &quot;Foreigners&quot;, &quot;Three Fevers&quot;, &quot;Phantom Lobster&quot; and &quot;Sally Lunn&quot;, the second of which was filmed as &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot; (1935). The author&#x27;s note to &quot;Phantom Lobster&quot;, states that &quot;There is no secret about Bramblewick. Its latitude and longitude are roughly 54.28.40 north, 0.34.10. west.&quot;

He died in Fowey, Cornwall, on 8 June 1966. The house he lived in at 21 Passage Street was named &quot;Bramblewick&quot; after his book series. The house that he lived in on King&#x27;s Street in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay has a blue plaque on the outside.

<text>The Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences (CAS or A&amp;S) is an academic college at Cornell University. It has been part of the university since its founding in 1865, although its name has changed over time. It is the largest of Cornell University&#x27;s colleges and schools with 4,251 undergraduate and 1,301 students and 526 faculty.

The college grants bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and masters and doctorates through affiliation with the Cornell University Graduate School. Its major academic buildings are located on the Arts Quad of Cornell University&#x27;s main campus in Ithaca, New York, which includes some of the university&#x27;s oldest and most historic buildings. 

==History==
===19th century===

When it was founded in 1865, Cornell University&#x27;s faculty was initially undifferentiated. With the founding of the Cornell Law School in 1886 and the concomitant self-segregation of the school&#x27;s lawyers, however, departments and colleges began to be formed at the university.

===20th century===
In 1903, the academic division that ultimately became the College of Arts and Sciences was renamed as the Academic Department. The College endowed the first professorships in American history, musicology, and American literature. 

From 1923 to 1945, Cornell professor Robert Morris Ogden, a professor of psychology and expert on Gestalt psychology, served as the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. 

===21st century===
As of 2009, the College of Arts and Sciences teaches 4,100 undergraduates, with 600 full-time faculty members plus a number of lecturers, who teach 2,200 courses.

In June 2018, Ray Jayawardhana was named the 22nd dean. On July 13, 2023, Rachel Bean succeeded Jayawardhana as interim dean.

==Arts Quadrangle== 

The Arts Quad on the campus of Cornell University is the site of the university&#x27;s original academic buildings, which are associated with most of the College of Arts and Sciences&#x27; classes and programs. On the western side of the quad, at the top of Libe Slope, are Morrill Hall (completed in 1866), McGraw Hall (1872) and White Hall (1868). All of these buildings are built with native Cayuga bluestone to reflect Ezra Cornell&#x27;s utilitarianism and are known as Stone Row. The statue of Ezra Cornell, dating back to 1919, stands between Morrill and McGraw Halls. Across from this statue, in front of Goldwin Smith Hall, sits the statue of Andrew Dickson White, Cornell&#x27;s other co-founder and its first president.

Lincoln Hall (1888) also stands on the eastern face of the quad next to Goldwin Smith Hall. On the northern face are the domed Sibley Hall and Tjaden Hall (1883). Just off of the quad on the Slope, next to Tjaden, stands the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, designed by I. M. Pei (1973). Stimson Hall (1902), Olin Library (1959) and Uris Library (1892), with Cornell&#x27;s landmark clocktower, McGraw Tower, stand on the southern end of the quad.

Olin Library replaced Boardman Hall (1892), the original location of the Cornell Law School. In 1992, an underground addition was made to the quad with Kroch Library, an extension of Olin Library that houses several special collections of the Cornell University Library, including the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.
Klarman Hall, the first new humanities building at Cornell in over 100 years, opened in 2016. Klarman houses the offices of Comparative Literature and Romance Studies. The building is connected to, and surrounded on three sides by, Goldwin Smith Hall and fronts East Avenue.

Legends and lore about the Arts Quad and its statues can be found at Cornelliana.

<doc id="1190250" wikidata="Q965389" url="?curid=1190250" title="Traditional Thai massage">
<text>Traditional Thai massage or Thai yoga massage is a traditional therapy combining acupressure, Indian Ayurvedic principles, and assisted yoga postures. In the Thai language, it is usually called &quot;nuat phaen thai&quot; (, ; lit. &#x27;Thai-style massage&#x27;) or &quot;nuat phaen boran&quot; (, ; lit. &#x27;ancient-style massage&#x27;), though its formal name is &quot;nuat thai&quot; (, ; lit. &#x27;Thai massage&#x27;) according to the Traditional Thai Medical Professions Act, BE 2556 (2013).

UNESCO added traditional Thai massage to its Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in December 2019.

==Practice==
Traditional Thai massage combines acupressure, Indian Ayurvedic principles, and assisted yoga postures, but with no use of oils or lotions. The recipient remains clothed during treatment. There is constant body contact between the giver and receiver, but rather than rubbing on muscles, the body is compressed, pulled, stretched and rocked. The concept of metta (loving-kindness), based on Buddhist teachings, is an integral part of this practice. Well-known practitioners also emphasize meditation and devotion on a part of the practitioner as integral to the effectiveness of this practice.

==History==
Thai massage, like Thai traditional medicine (TTM), is a combination of influences from Indian and Southeast Asian traditions of medicine, and the art as it is practiced today is likely to be the product of a 19th-century synthesis of various healing traditions from all over the kingdom.

The spirit intermediary of traditional Thai massage and Thai medicine is Jīvaka (ชีวกโกมารภัจจ์ Jīvaka Komarabhācca), who is said in the Pāli Buddhist canon to have been the Buddha&#x27;s physician over 2,500 years ago. He is recorded in ancient documents as having extraordinary medical skills, his knowledge of herbal medicine, and for having treated important people of his day, including the Buddha himself.

==Training==
The Thai Ministry of Public Health&#x27;s Department for Development of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine regulates Thai traditional massage venues and practitioners. the department says 913 traditional clinics have been registered nationwide in Thailand. , of the 8,000 to 10,000 spa and massage shops in Thailand; only 4,228 are certified by the Health Ministry&#x27;s Department of Health Service Support (HSS).

A licensed, traditional massage practitioner is required to complete at least 800 hours training. Massage therapists must acquire a professional license and must register at the Public Health Ministry&#x27;s Department of Health Service Support (HSS). To qualify for a license, therapists must be trained in courses created by the HSS. The standard courses are provided free. Alternatively, students can go to one of the 181 schools nationwide approved to train therapists using standard HSS courses.

Wat Pho, the center of Thai medicine and massage for centuries, opened the Wat Pho Thai Traditional Medical and Massage School in 1955 on the temple grounds, the first such school approved by the Thai Ministry of Education. Wat Pho offers four basic courses of Thai medicine: Thai massage, Thai midwife-nurse, Thai pharmacy, and Thai medical practice. Thai massage is also taught and practiced in other countries.

==Effectiveness==
All types of massage, including Thai massage, can help people relax, temporarily relieve muscle and/or joint pain, and temporarily boost a person&#x27;s mood. However, many practitioners&#x27; claims go far beyond those effects well demonstrated by clinical study. Some clinicians dispute its efficacy.

<text>Arturo García Bustos (August 8, 1926 – April 7, 2017) was a Mexican painter and print maker. He is known as one of “Los Fridos” students who studied under Frida Kahlo at her home in Coyoacán.

==Life==
Arturo García Bustos was born in Mexico City, near the Zócalo. He grew up during the time when Mexican muralism was dominant, which drew him to art. After attending high school at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria Núm 1, specializing in architecture, he entered the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas in 1941, at age fifteen. The following year (1943) he entered the Escuela de Pintura y Escultura (&quot;La Esmeralda&quot;) where his teachers were Frida Kahlo, Feliciano Peña, Agustín Lazo and María Izquierdo, studying there for five years. During his career he studied printmaking as well, including courses in printmaking with Korean artist Wan Jon Ja in Pyongyang and Chinese printing in Beijing in 1957.

García Bustos’ social life when he was younger revolved around the circles of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, even meeting his wife, Rina Lazo through the famous couple. He married her in 1949.

The couple were married for over 60 years until Arturo died. They lived in the Coyoacán borough of Mexico City in a colonial house called Casa Colorada, on Calle de Vallarta in the La Conchita neighborhood. Their home is said to be a residence of La Malinche. It was later a monastery, prison and hospital. After living there for more than forty years, in 2006, they opened part of it on the ground floor to house the Galería de la Casa Colorado. This gallery is run by the couple&#x27;s only daughter, Rina García Lazo, who is an architect specializing in the restoration of monuments.

Bustos died in Mexico City on April 7, 2017. His last exhibition took place at Universidad Iberoamericana. This was a cooperative display by him and his wife, and was mounted by alumni from the Art History major.

In 2005, a collection consisting of eleven of his paintings was exhibited at the Museo Mural Diego Rivera of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, in Mexico City.

While he was better known for his graphic work, he also did a number of murals. In 1947 he assisted Frida Kahlo with a mural at the Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez House in Coyoacán. Other projects include a fresco the Hotel Posada del Sol in Mexico City (1948), a fresco depicting Zapata at the Escuela Rural de Temixco, Morelos (1950), a series of seven murals at the Sociedad Cooperativa Ejidal, with Rina Lazo and Atilio Carrasco (1952), a fresco called Pobledores de las Siete Regiones de Oaxaca at the Museo Nacional de Antropología (1964), A series of sixteen print murals to decorate the Venustiano Carranza House Museum in Cuatro Ciénegas, Coahuila (1969), A series of nine panels for the Casa de Obrero Mundial in Mexico City (1971), &quot;Oaxaca en la historia y en el mito&quot; at the state government building in the city of Oaxaca (1980), and a mural at the cultural center of Azcapotzalco, Mexico City.

Most of his career was spent teaching and giving lectures, seminars and conferences.

==Artistry==
García Bustos considered hieself to be an &quot;heir to the figurative strand of Mexican art.&quot; He recalled the impact that seeing Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco at work made on him in Mexico City, prompting him to have &quot;visual shocks&quot; and dream that he too was painting murals.

<doc id="1190259" wikidata="Q5224620" url="?curid=1190259" title="Darrell Evans (musician)">
<text>Darrell Patton Evans (born October 6, 1968) is an American evangelical Christian musician and songwriter, known primarily for his contributions to contemporary Christian worship. He is known as the writer of songs like &quot;Trading My Sorrows&quot;, &quot;Let the River Flow&quot;, &quot;Your Love Is Extravagant&quot;, &quot;Redeemer, Savior Friend&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Fields of Grace.&quot;

Influenced by the music of Bruce Springsteen and U2, his style of music is noted for its extensive use of free form composition, with several of his songs having been written spontaneously during concerts and worship times. Besides his music writing, he is an accomplished guitar player and singer.

==Biography==
He was born in San Francisco, California, into a military family, where they moved frequently around the western United States and Europe. Evans was the oldest child of a practicing Catholic couple. He became a born-again Christian at a Leon Patillo concert in 1980 at eleven years old. He began worship leading at fourteen years old.

He was a student of LIFE Bible College in San Dimas, California, before relocating to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he was a worship leader at Vineyard Church, while he learned evangelism at Oral Roberts University. He went to Reno, Nevada, after leaving Oral Roberts, where he took a worship leader position with University Family Fellowship, before again going back to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to lead worship at Open Bible Fellowship Church.

=== Music and ministry ===
Evans started honing his songwriting at fourteen years-old, eventually becoming known as the writer of songs like &quot;Trading My Sorrows&quot;, &quot;Let the River Flow&quot;, &quot;Your Love Is Extravagant&quot;, &quot;Redeemer, Savior Friend&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Fields of Grace.&quot; He is considered by many to be a pioneer in the modern worship music movement.

Evans&#x27;s ministry started as a teenager in Olympia, WA, playing spiritual music for classmates in his parents&#x27; home. He has served as a worship pastor for churches in Washington, California, Oklahoma and Texas.

For the past 17 years Darrell has traveled the world alone and with the band, combining music with worship, preaching, and prayer.

Darrell&#x27;s projects &quot;Let the River Flow&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot; both garnered Dove award nominations and influenced a new wave of congregational worship. A later project, &quot;Nothing Less Than Everything&quot;, wraps his joy, passion and experience in a fresh and powerful sound. In Darrell&#x27;s words, &quot;It&#x27;s my prayer that the Lord will use these songs to help people connect with Jesus in a life-changing way&quot;.

In 2013, Evans signed an exclusive publishing administration deal with Watershed Music Group, while continuing to release independent worship recording project.

== Personal life ==
Evans has five children: two daughters, Leah and Makenzie, and three sons, Connor, Zachary and Grayson. &quot;They are my heart and world. My kids have changed my life for the better. I want to be the Godly father and leader that they need,&quot; Darrell said about his children.

<text>In mathematics, a function between topological spaces is called proper if inverse images of compact subsets are compact. In algebraic geometry, the analogous concept is called a proper morphism.

==Definition==

There are several competing definitions of a &quot;proper function&quot;. 
Some authors call a function formula_1 between two topological spaces if the preimage of every compact set in formula_2 is compact in formula_3
Other authors call a map formula_4 if it is continuous and ; that is if it is a continuous closed map and the preimage of every point in formula_2 is compact. The two definitions are equivalent if formula_2 is locally compact and Hausdorff.

Let formula_1 be a closed map, such that formula_8 is compact (in formula_9) for all formula_10 Let formula_11 be a compact subset of formula_12 It remains to show that formula_13 is compact.

Let formula_14 be an open cover of formula_15 Then for all formula_16 this is also an open cover of formula_17 Since the latter is assumed to be compact, it has a finite subcover. In other words, for every formula_18 there exists a finite subset formula_19 such that formula_20
The set formula_21 is closed in formula_9 and its image under formula_4 is closed in formula_2 because formula_4 is a closed map. Hence the set
formula_26 
is open in formula_12 It follows that formula_28 contains the point formula_29
Now formula_30 and because formula_11 is assumed to be compact, there are finitely many points formula_32 such that formula_33 Furthermore, the set formula_34 is a finite union of finite sets, which makes formula_35 a finite set.

Now it follows that formula_36 and we have found a finite subcover of formula_37 which completes the proof.
If formula_9 is Hausdorff and formula_2 is locally compact Hausdorff then proper is equivalent to . A map is universally closed if for any topological space formula_40 the map formula_41 is closed. In the case that formula_2 is Hausdorff, this is equivalent to requiring that for any map formula_43 the pullback formula_44 be closed, as follows from the fact that formula_45 is a closed subspace of formula_46

An equivalent, possibly more intuitive definition when formula_9 and formula_2 are metric spaces is as follows: we say an infinite sequence of points formula_49 in a topological space formula_9 if, for every compact set formula_51 only finitely many points formula_52 are in formula_53 Then a continuous map formula_1 is proper if and only if for every sequence of points formula_55 that escapes to infinity in formula_56 the sequence formula_57 escapes to infinity in formula_12

==Properties==

* Every continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is both proper and closed.
* Every surjective proper map is a compact covering map.
** A map formula_1 is called a if for every compact subset formula_60 there exists some compact subset formula_61 such that formula_62 
* A topological space is compact if and only if the map from that space to a single point is proper.
* If formula_1 is a proper continuous map and formula_2 is a compactly generated Hausdorff space (this includes Hausdorff spaces that are either first-countable or locally compact), then formula_4 is closed.

==Generalization==

It is possible to generalize 
the notion of proper maps of topological spaces to locales and topoi, see .

<text>Mary White Ovington (April 11, 1865 – July 15, 1951) was an American socialist, suffragist, journalist, and co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

==Biography==
Mary White Ovington was born April 11, 1865, in Brooklyn, New York City. Her grandmother attended the Connecticut congregation of Samuel Joseph May. Her parents, members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women&#x27;s rights and had been involved in the anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College of Harvard University, Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church and a 1903 speech by Booker T. Washington at the Social Reform Club.

In 1894, Ovington met Ida B. Wells, while taking Christmas presents to Ida&#x27;s sister&#x27;s children. Mary was so appalled by their living conditions that she started working with Wells to force the city to update the tenements. In 1895, she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year, Ovington remained until 1904, when she was appointed a fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years, she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations, she met W. E. B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement.

In 1905, Ovington joined the Socialist Party of America, influenced by the ideas of William Morris. There she met A. Philip Randolph, Floyd Dell, Max Eastman and Jack London, who argued racial problems were as much a matter of class as of race. Ovington wrote for journals and newspapers such as &quot;The Masses&quot;, &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, and the &quot;New York Call&quot;. She also worked with Ray Stannard Baker and influenced the content of his 1908 book, &quot;Following the Color Line&quot;.

On September 3, 1908, she read an article written by Socialist William English Walling, entitled &quot;Race War in the North&quot;, in &quot;The Independent&quot;. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in Springfield, Illinois, the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing to Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City, along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African Americans on the centennial of Lincoln&#x27;s birthday, February 12, 1909.

The National Negro Committee held its first meeting in New York on May 31 and June 1, 1909. By May 1910, the National Negro Committee and attendants, at its second conference, organized a permanent body known as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Ovington was appointed as its executive secretary. Early members included Josephine Ruffin, Mary Talbert, Mary Church Terrell, Inez Milholland, Jane Addams, George Henry White, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Edward Russell, John Dewey, Charles Darrow, Lincoln Steffens, Ray Stannard Baker, Fanny Garrison Villard, Oswald Garrison Villard, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett. The following year, Ovington attended the Universal Races Congress in London. Richetta Randolph Wallace, who had worked with Ovington as a secretary for several years, was hired as the first office staff at NAACP headquarters in 1912.

Ovington remained active in the struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1921, she wrote to Alice Paul asking that a black woman be invited to the National Women&#x27;s Party celebration of the passing of the nineteenth amendment. Ovington was also a pacifist who opposed the United States&#x27;s involvement in the First World War. During the war Ovington supported A. Philip Randolph and his magazine &quot;The Messenger&quot;, which campaigned for black civil rights.
After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as a board member, executive secretary, and chairman. She inspired other women to join the NAACP, and in so doing, made a significant contribution to the multi-cultural composition of the organization. NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting, and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by Southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915 and 1923 concerning voting rights and housing.

In June 1934, Ovington gave speeches to 14 different colleges. Her goal was to show the youth that the NAACP association was made up of blacks and whites, specifically to show black youth that there were whites who hated race oppression. During her speeches, Ovington would show the geography of all the NAACP location branches and how far the association has come. &quot;They should know the power the race has gained&quot; - Mary White Ovington

The NAACP was criticized by some members of the African-American community. Members of the organization were physically attacked by white racists. John R. Shillady, executive secretary of the NAACP, was badly beaten up when he visited Austin, Texas, in 1919.

Ovington wrote several books and articles, including a study of black Manhattan, &quot;Half a Man&quot; (1911); &quot;Status of the Negro in the United States&quot; (1913); &quot;Socialism and the Feminist Movement&quot; (1914); an anthology for black children, &quot;The Upward Path&quot; (1919); biographical sketches of prominent African Americans, &quot;Portraits in Color&quot; (1927); an autobiography, &quot;Reminiscences&quot; (1932); and a history of the NAACP, &quot;The Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot; (1947).

==Final years and death==
In 1947, Ovington was forced to resign from the NAACP due to poor health, ending 38 years of service with the organization. In her eighties, she spent her final years with her sister in Massachusetts and died on July 15, 1951, in Newton Highlands, at the age of 86. Ovington also wrote novels and children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Hazel&quot; (1913), which told the story of a young Boston Black girl spending a winter in Alabama at the turn of the century.

==Legacy==

Mary White Ovington Middle School (Intermediate School 30) in Brooklyn was named in her honor. Ovington is one of the persons named on The Extra Mile—Points of Light Volunteer Pathway National Memorial in Washington, D.C. In 2009, she was depicted on a United States postage stamp with Mary Church Terrell.

<doc id="1190268" wikidata="Q3137449" url="?curid=1190268" title="Suijin">
<text>is a general name for the god of water in Japanese mythology. The term refers to the heavenly and earthly manifestations of the benevolent Shinto divinity of water (mainly freshwater), as well as to a wide variety of mythical and magical creatures found in lakes, ponds, springs, and wells, including serpents (snakes, dragons, eels, fish, turtles), and the flesh-eating kappa. Mizu-no-kamisama, Mizugami, or Suijin is popularly revered and worshipped in temples and continues to influence Japanese culture. Other names of Suijin include and .

Suijin is often conflated with Ryūjin, the Japanese dragon god associated with water. Fudō Myōō is sometimes called &quot;Suijin&quot; because of his believed association with waterfalls. Suijin appears as a stone plaque or even a small stone set upright near the emergence of a spring.

==Worship==

The Shinto water god is believed to be the guardian of fishermen and the patron saint of fertility, motherhood, and painless childbirth. People worship Suijin with offerings, believing that doing so will ensure pure and unpolluted water for drinking, agriculture, and sanitation, and will bring success in fishing trips, fertility, motherhood, and easy childbirth. Shrines devoted to the worship of the Water God are called Suitengū Shrines.

There are several numbers of shrines in Japan associated with deities. An example of this is the Horse God in Kurume, Fukuoka, the main shrine for all Suitengū Shrines in Japan. This shrine is visited by pregnant women who wish to ensure a safe and easy birth for their children. Another famous Suitengū Shrine is the Tsukiji Suijin Shrine, located near the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, which was built to protect and watch over the fishermen and their businesses. 

Suijin is widely worshipped at Suitengū Shrines throughout Japan through votive stone markers devoted to the Water God. Most of these stone markers can be found enshrined at dikes, agricultural irrigation canals, rice paddy fields, mountain springs, regular springs, streams, rivers, wells, household wells, and even inside sewage water and septic tanks. When a Suijin stone marker is enshrined at mountain springs that form sources for agricultural waterways, it is often labelled as &quot;water distributing god&quot; (kumari no kami 水分神), in which case it may also be associated with the god of the mountain (Yama no kami 山の神).

=== Festivals ===

There are many Japanese festivals dedicated to the water god, most of which occur during summer and winter, though more emphasis is placed on summer festivals. The majority of summer festivals occur at the Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto and the Tsushima Shrine in Tsushima. These observances have a significant role in the exorcism of bad spirits and purification, primarily aimed at dangerous epidemics, diseases and natural and man-made water-related disasters which commonly happen during the summer. 

List of festivals worshipping Suijin (this list may not include all festivals):
* Suijin Matsuri, December 1 and June 15 — On these days in Japan, various locations hold the Suijin Matsuri, a Shinto celebration and ceremony to honour the god of water.
* Kamakura Matsuri, Akita Prefecture, around February 15–17 — Igloos (called &quot;Kamakura&quot;) are built with a small alcove inside dedicated to Suijin, who is honoured during this festival to ensure good crops in the coming year. This festival is over 400 years old.
* Suijin-sai, Funabashi Fishing Harbour (Chiba), April 3 — A festival to pray for good fishing hauls and safety at sea. All fishing boats from the area gather in the harbour and a Kagura ritual (sacred Shinto music and dance), dedicated to the god of the sea, is performed onboard each vessel. A ritual existing since the Edo Period, the festival is called Futuna-sai for short. 
* Suitengū Spring Festival, Kurume City (Fukuoka), May 3–5 — This annual festival, held at the Suitengū Shrine in Kurume City, is reportedly over 800 years old. Participants pray for safe and easy childbirth, for protection from drowning, and ask for the safety and health of children. This festival is also held at other Suitengū sites in Japan on May 5. Another major festival in Kurume City is the Water Festival, which takes place from August 3 to 5.
* Okinohata Suitengu Festival, Yanagawa (Fukuoka), May 3–5 — Held on the canal by the shrine for three days and nights, drawing about 30,000 total visitors. Many pray for their children to be protected from drowning.
* Gion Festival, near Tsukuba (Ibaraki), around July 25 — The Anniversary feast of Suijin-gū Shrine of Tsuchiura City (Ibaraki). Water is splashed over the portable shrine.

<doc id="1190270" wikidata="Q2996684" url="?curid=1190270" title="Plücker embedding">
<text>In mathematics, the Plücker map embeds the Grassmannian formula_1, whose elements are &quot;k&quot;-dimensional subspaces of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;, either real or complex, in a projective space, thereby realizing it as a projective algebraic variety. More precisely, the Plücker map embeds formula_1 into the projectivization formula_3 of the formula_4-th exterior power of formula_5. The image is algebraic, consisting of the intersection of a number of quadrics defined by the (see below).

The Plücker embedding was first defined by Julius Plücker in the case formula_6 as a way of describing the lines in three-dimensional space (which, as projective lines in real projective space, correspond to two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space). The image of that embedding is the Klein quadric in RP5.

Hermann Grassmann generalized Plücker&#x27;s embedding to arbitrary &quot;k&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. The homogeneous coordinates of the image of the Grassmannian formula_7 under the Plücker embedding, relative to the basis in the exterior space formula_8 corresponding to the natural basis in formula_9 (where formula_10 is the base field) are called Plücker coordinates.

== Definition ==
Denoting by formula_11 the formula_12-dimensional vector space over the field formula_10, and by
formula_14 the Grassmannian of formula_4-dimensional subspaces of formula_5, the Plücker embedding is the map &quot;ι&quot; defined by

::formula_17

where formula_18 is a basis for the element formula_19 and formula_20 is the projective equivalence class of the element formula_21 of the formula_4th exterior power of formula_5.

This is an embedding of the Grassmannian into the projectivization formula_3. The image can be completely characterized as the intersection of a number of quadrics, the Plücker quadrics (see below), which are expressed by homogeneous quadratic relations on the Plücker coordinates (see below) that derive from linear algebra.

The bracket ring appears as the ring of polynomial functions on formula_8.

== Plücker relations ==
The image under the Plücker embedding satisfies a simple set of homogeneous quadratic relations, usually called the Plücker relations, or Grassmann–Plücker relations, defining the intersection of a number of quadrics in formula_26. This shows that the Grassmannian embeds as an algebraic subvariety of formula_3 and gives another method of constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Grassmann–Plücker relations, let formula_28 be the formula_4-dimensional subspace spanned by the basis represented by column vectors formula_30. 
Let formula_31 be the formula_32 matrix of homogeneous coordinates, whose columns are formula_30. Then the equivalence class formula_34 of all such homogeneous coordinates matrices
formula_35 related to each other by right multiplication by an invertible formula_36 matrix formula_37 may be identified with the element formula_38. For any ordered sequence formula_39 
of formula_40 integers, let formula_41 be the determinant of the formula_42 matrix whose rows are the rows formula_43 of formula_31. Then, up to projectivization, formula_45 are the Plücker coordinates of the element formula_46 whose homogeneous coordinates are formula_47. They are the linear coordinates of the image formula_48 of formula_49 under the Plücker map, relative to the standard basis in the exterior space formula_50. Changing the basis defining the homogeneous coordinate matrix formula_31 just changes the Plücker coordinates by a nonzero scaling factor equal to the determinant of the change of basis matrix formula_52,
and hence just the representative of the projective equivalence class in formula_50. 

For any two ordered sequences: 
::formula_54
of positive integers formula_55, the following homogeneous equations are valid, and determine the image of formula_38 under the Plücker map:
=0,
&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_57 denotes the sequence formula_58 with the term formula_59 omitted. These are generally referred to as the Plücker relations.
When and , we get formula_60, the simplest Grassmannian which is not a projective space, and the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the coordinates of formula_61 by 
:: formula_62
the image of formula_60 under the Plücker map is defined by the single equation

::formula_64

In general, many more equations are needed to define the image of the Plücker embedding, as in (), 
but these are not, in general, algebraically independent. The maximal number of algebraically independent relations (on Zariski open sets)
is given by the difference of dimension between formula_3 and formula_66, which is formula_67

<text>Sir William Heerlein Lindley (30 January 1853, in Hamburg – 30 December 1917, in London) was a British civil engineer.

One of three sons of the famous British engineer William Lindley, WH Lindley worked together with his father on a number of projects and was a respected engineer in his own right. Between 1881 and 1889 he oversaw the construction of Warsaw waterworks, designed by his father in 1876–1878. He oversaw the construction of the sewage system in Prague, built between 1895 and 1906, which is still in use today, and Sewage plant in Bubeneč in Prague, which was in use from 1907 until 1967 and currently its building serves as a museum of Prague&#x27;s sewage system and is highly dedicated to Lindley. Between 1897 and 1898 he worked on the project for a water-supply system for Iași, which he linked, via an underground cast-iron aqueduct, to an aquifer located 103 kilometres away, in Timișești, Neamț County; Lindley&#x27;s project was materialised in 1911, and the water system is still used. He also coordinated the project for Baku&#x27;s water supply system, working from 1899 up until his death in 1917. In 1909 he also designed a water and sewerage system for Łódź, Poland, although the expense of the system meant the project was shelved until the 1920s.

<doc id="1190281" wikidata="Q851452" url="?curid=1190281" title="USS Merrimack (1855)">
<text>USS &quot;Merrimack, also improperly Merrimac&quot;, was a steam frigate, best known as the hull upon which the ironclad warship CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; was constructed during the American Civil War. The CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; then took part in the Battle of Hampton Roads (also known as &quot;the Battle of the &quot;Monitor&quot; and the &quot;Merrimack&quot;&quot;) in the first engagement between ironclad warships.

&quot;Merrimack&quot; was the first of six screw frigates (steam frigates powered by screw propellers) begun in 1854. Like others of her class (, , , and ), she was named after a river. The Merrimack originates in New Hampshire and flows through the town of Merrimac, Massachusetts, often considered an older spelling which has sometimes caused confusion of the name. After the ship was burned on April 20 1861, it was rebuilt with iron siding in the American Civil War by the Confederacy and renamed the Virginia.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
&quot;Merrimack&quot; was launched by the Boston Navy Yard 15 June 1855, sponsored by Mary E. Simmons, and commissioned 20 February 1856, Captain Garrett J. Pendergrast in command. She was the second ship of the Navy to be named for the Merrimack River.

=== Service ===
Shakedown cruises took the new screw frigate to the Caribbean and to Western Europe. &quot;Merrimack&quot; visited Southampton, Brest, Lisbon, and Toulon before returning to Boston and decommissioning 22 April 1857 for repairs. Recommissioning 1 September 1857, &quot;Merrimack&quot; got underway from Boston Harbor 17 October as flagship for the Pacific Squadron. She rounded Cape Horn and cruised the Pacific coast of South and Central America until heading for home 14 November 1859. Upon returning to Norfolk, she decommissioned 16 February 1860.

&quot;Merrimack&quot; was still in ordinary during the crisis preceding Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration. Soon after becoming Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles took action to prepare the frigate for sea, planning to move her to Philadelphia. The day before the firing on Fort Sumter, Welles directed that &quot;great vigilance be exercised in guarding and protecting&quot; Norfolk Navy Yard and her ships. On the afternoon of 17 April 1861, the day Virginia seceded, Engineer in Chief B. F. Isherwood managed to get the frigate&#x27;s engines lit off; but the previous night secessionists had sunk light boats in the channel between Craney Island and Sewell&#x27;s Point, blocking &quot;Merrimack&quot;. On 20 April, before evacuating the Navy Yard, the U.S. Navy burned &quot;Merrimack&quot; to the waterline and sank her to preclude capture. 
The Confederacy, in desperate need of ships, raised &quot;Merrimack&quot; and rebuilt her as an ironclad ram, according to a design prepared by Lt. John Mercer Brooke, CSN. Commissioned as CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; 17 February 1862, the ironclad was the hope of the Confederacy to destroy the wooden ships in Hampton Roads, and to end the Union blockade which had already seriously impeded the Confederate war effort.

<text>William Lindley (7 September 1808 – 22 May 1900), was an English engineer who together with his sons designed water and sewerage systems for over 30 cities across Europe.

==Life==
Lindley was born in London. As a young engineer he worked together with Marc Isambard Brunel and Francis Giles. In 1834, he went to Germany as Giles&#x27; assistant to survey the railway route from Lübeck to Hamburg. A few years later, in 1838, he was commissioned to build the Hamburg-Bergedorf Railway Company (), the first railway line which was carried out in northern Germany. The official opening had to be cancelled as a catastrophic fire in May 1842 left a third of the town in ruins. Lindley became a member of the Technical Commission for the reconstruction of the town centre (with Alexis de Chateauneuf, Gottfried Semper and others) and designed the first fundamental plan for the reconstruction of the city. For the engineer, who had already been commissioned to design a new sewer system for Hamburg, the destruction was an opportunity to modernise the city.

His designs, influenced by English social reformer and public health inspector Edwin Chadwick, included the first underground sewers in continental Europe. Within three years 11 km of sewers had been built in Hamburg, and Lindley began work on a waterworks to supply the city with drinking water. In the following years he helped design and build water systems in a number of other German cities and towns such as Altona, Stralsund and Leipzig.

At Hamburg, Lindley developed an increasing interest in urban planning. In 1840, he was commissioned to drain the Hammerbrook marshes, east of the town centre of Hamburg. This drainage system, which was implemented by the construction of a grid of canals connected by locks with the Elbe river (1842–47), provided the basis of the first modern suburb at Hamburg, primarily as an industrial area. In 1855 he also designed an early master plan for the development of the areas west of the town centre. However, as his design for the Hamburg harbour (1845, with James Walker and Heinrich Hübbe) was used, the plan was not carried out.

Due to the re-organisation of the Hamburg building authorities he gave up his position as a consultant of the Baudeputation in 1860, and moved with his family to London, including his three young sons – William Heerlein Lindley (born 1853), Robert Searles Lindley (born 1854) and Joseph Lindley (born 1859). In 1863, he began work on the sewerage system of Frankfurt am Main, the benefits of which became apparent as between 1868 and 1883 the death rate from typhoid fell from 80 to 10 per 100,000 inhabitants.

Lindley&#x27;s designs were in demand across Europe, and together with his sons he built systems for cities in Germany (including Düsseldorf) and elsewhere, including Saint Petersburg, Budapest, Prague and Moscow. In 1876, the Australian city of Sydney even asked him to design a sewer system for them, but he turned them down, as he had just been commissioned by Warsaw in Poland.

Between 1876 and 1878, he designed the Warsaw waterworks, which were constructed between 1881 and 1889 under the direction of his son, William Heerlein Lindley. To this day, there is a street in Warsaw named after him, which goes around the historical waterworks. Also named after the Lindleys&#x27; handiwork is &quot;Filter Street&quot; (&quot;ulica Filtrowa&quot;). As a sidenote, the system that William Lindley designed for Warsaw is still operational, and the last sewer collector of his design was not replaced until 2001.

He died in May 1900 in Blackheath, London, aged 91.

<text>Stanford Memorial Church (also referred to informally as MemChu) is located on the Main Quad at the center of the Stanford University campus in Stanford, California, United States. It was built during the American Renaissance by Jane Stanford as a memorial to her husband Leland. Designed by architect Charles A. Coolidge, a student of Henry Hobson Richardson, the church has been called &quot;the University&#x27;s architectural crown jewel&quot;.

Designs for the church were submitted to Jane Stanford and the university trustees in 1898, and it was dedicated in 1903. The building is Romanesque in form and Byzantine in its details, inspired by churches in the region of Venice, especially, Ravenna. Its stained glass windows and extensive mosaics are based on religious paintings the Stanfords admired in Europe. The church has five pipe organs, which allow musicians to produce many styles of organ music. Stanford Memorial Church has withstood two major earthquakes, in 1906 and 1989, and was extensively renovated after each.

Stanford Memorial Church was the earliest and has been &quot;among the most prominent&quot; non-denominational churches on the West Coast of the United States. Since its dedication in 1903, the church&#x27;s goal has been to serve the spiritual needs of the university in a non-sectarian way. The church&#x27;s first chaplain, David Charles Gardner, began a tradition of leadership which has guided the development of Stanford University&#x27;s spiritual, ethical, and academic relation to religion. The church&#x27;s chaplains were instrumental in the founding of Stanford&#x27;s religious studies department, moving Stanford from a &quot;secular university&quot; at the middle of the century to &quot;the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford&quot; in the late 1960s, when the study of religion at the university focused on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Stanford Memorial Church is located at the center of Stanford University, and is &quot;the principle building that is seen as the visitor approaches the University along Palm Drive from Palo Alto&quot;. It sits the middle of the long southern range of the school&#x27;s Main Quad. The church was commissioned by Jane Stanford (1828–1905) as a memorial to her husband, Leland Stanford (1824–93). The Stanfords had intended that a church should become &quot;the centerpiece of the university complex&quot;. They were deeply religious, and for their day and social standing, &quot;open-minded ecumenicalists&quot;, so Jane Stanford was determined that a church built on campus be a &quot;nondenominational—if essentially Protestant—house of worship&quot;. Robert C. Gregg, who was chaplain of Memorial Church during the 1980s and 1990s, stated that the Stanfords had two objectives in building the church: to ensure that Stanford students had an opportunity to develop their ethics as well as their studies, and to provide comfort and strength to the community.

Leland Stanford died in 1893; legal disputes tied up the Stanford estate and prevented the completion of the university for several years. When the disputes were settled in Jane Stanford&#x27;s favor, she was finally able to put into motion her wish for a church. In 1898, she and the university trustees requested design submissions for the church. In 1890, Jane Stanford visited her friend Maurizio Camerino in Venice, an artist with a reputation for producing high-quality mosaics; she and her husband had met him years earlier during one of their many trips to Europe. Stanford commissioned Camerino and his company, the Antonio Salviati studios, to produce mosaics for the church. Stanford was involved in every part of the church&#x27;s design and construction. She was determined that the quality of the stonework of Memorial Church should equal the medieval churches she admired in Europe. According to Memorial Church chaplain Robert C. Gregg, &quot;The grandeur of the church, articulated in its details, greatly occupied Jane Stanford—the structure was to be without flaw&quot;.

Groundbreaking for the church took place in May 1899; construction began in January 1900. After a delay of almost a year, Stanford Memorial Church was dedicated on January 25, 1903, with &quot;impressive ceremonies&quot;. Demonstrating Jane Stanford&#x27;s goal of ecumenicism, Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger of San Francisco&#x27;s Congregation Emanu-El read the first Bible lesson. The church&#x27;s pastor, Heber Newton, gave the sermon. A second service was held later that day, and D. Charles Gardner, the chaplain, gave the sermon. Stanford Memorial Church&#x27;s first christening was held between the two services.

Jane Stanford once remarked: &quot;While my whole heart is in the university, my soul is in that church&quot;. She died in 1905, and so did not live to see the damage caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Her funeral took place in the church, which was called one of her most important accomplishments and &quot;the truest reflection of her visionary leadership&quot;, in March 1905. Clergy from several religious traditions, including a Rabbi, a Presbyterian minister, a Methodist minister, an Episcopal bishop, and a Baptist minister, officiated at the service.

=== Earthquakes ===
Stanford Memorial Church has suffered two major earthquakes, in 1906 and in 1989. Although extensively damaged, the church was restored after each. The 1906 quake wrecked much of the church, felled the spire, cracked the walls, and &quot;injured beyond repair&quot; the mosaics and Carrara marble statuary in the chancel. The main cause of the severity of the damage was that the church&#x27;s original construction failed to attach the crossing structure to the surrounding masonry and roof structures. When the earthquake hit the church, the crossing structure moved independently from the rest of the building, gouging gaping holes in the roofs over the east and west transepts, the nave, and chancel. Its original 12-sided, 80-foot spire and its adjoining clock tower fell on top of the chancel roof, destroying the tower dome&#x27;s &quot;frescoed Victorian interpretation of God&#x27;s eye—complete with tear—surrounded by cherubs and shooting star&quot;. The debris hit and destroyed the marble sculptures of the twelve apostles that decorated the altar.

The spire was never repaired and the tower was removed and replaced by a simpler structure; however, the clock was saved and preserved in a temporary structure behind the church before eventually being placed in another building on campus, the Stanford Clock Tower. University trustees considered re-building the tower, and even looked at possible designs, but eventually chose not to rebuild it because they could not agree on its design, and chose instead to replace the tower with a domed skylight. The crossing structure also pushed the roof of the nave forward. The roof&#x27;s weak connection to the church&#x27;s front facade caused the facade to fall into the Inner Quad courtyard; as mosaic expert Joseph A. Taylor put it, &quot;its wondrous mosaic was blown out and totally destroyed&quot;. The only mosaics not destroyed in the quake were the four angels that decorated the crossing. The back of the church, with several hundred feet of arcades, was also completely leveled because it too was not joined to the rest of the building.

Repairs of the earthquake damage began in 1908, despite misgivings from some university administration regarding its cost; it was closed between 1906 and 1913 while it was repaired. The university president had to postpone academic projects to pay for the church&#x27;s restoration, as well as the restoration of the entire campus. Ultimately, they chose to repair Memorial Church because they recognized that it was &quot;integral to the identity of the young university&quot;. The church and the Old Chemistry building were the only two buildings in the university&#x27;s Inner Quad that were repaired. The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt. The entire church, except for its surviving crossing structure and offices, was dismantled stone by stone, which, along with the windows, were labelled and stored, and were later relaid in their original positions. According to architecture historian Willis L. Hall in his 1917 book about the church, &quot;In reconstruction great care has been taken to assure permanence&quot;. The stones were securely bolted to each other, &quot;making the whole structure practically one massive hollow rock on a great steel foundation skeleton&quot;. The tile floor was replaced with cork. The building&#x27;s crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an oculus, which lit the interior of the church, and was added above the renovated dome, which had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before the earthquake. The original rose window above the front facade was replaced with one with a simpler arch shape because it was more similar to the style of the rest of the buildings in the Inner Quad.
The dedication, which was engraved in large letters below the facade mosaic, was replaced by a smaller dedication plaque placed at the lower left of the facade, a choice the university alumni magazine called &quot;a tremendous improvement&quot;. Camerino&#x27;s design of the mosaics that were to fill in the empty space created by the removal of the original dedication, which he offered free of charge, were rejected in favor of a simple version created by John K. Branner (son of university president John Casper Branner) in 1914. Camerino, who did not appraise the damage until 1913, restored the interior mosaics. He had saved the original drawings in Venice, so he removed and re-fabricated the chancel mosaic, and redesigned the entire exterior mosaic. The Stanford alumni magazine, in early 1917, after the completion of the interior mosaics, declared the renovation complete, stating that &quot;the church, for almost the first time since it was begun, is finished&quot;. Its appearance after the renovation was &quot;significantly transformed&quot;.

In 1989 the church was damaged again, in the Loma Prieta earthquake. Although the damage was not as serious as the &#x27;06 earthquake, it &quot;spurred intricate strengthening and restoration work&quot; to protect further damage from future earthquakes. The Stanford Quake ‘06 Centennial Alliance stated that the damage was not devastating, even though the building did not fulfill the more stringent earthquake codes in place in 1989, because of the previous renovation after the &#x27;06 earthquake. The Alliance also stated that if the earthquake had been stronger or lasted longer, the damage would have been more extensive. The integrity of the structure remained, but the crossing structure, the only major part of the building that was not dismantled and replaced after the 1906 earthquake, buckled and caused several stones in the north and west arches to slip as much as .

The four mosaic angels in the pendentives, which decorated its high rounded walls directly below the church&#x27;s dome and served as the setting beds for hundreds of thousands of tesserae, were severely damaged. Parts of the fallen mosaics were stolen, but later returned anonymously. The angels&#x27; damage caused large chunks of mortar and glass to fall to the floor below, while other sections &quot;were left hanging by the sheer geometry of their arched shape&quot;. An eight-foot mosaic section of an angel&#x27;s left wing in the church&#x27;s northeast corner fell to the floor. Several stones from the east arch wall fell onto pews in the balcony, and the organ-loft railing collapsed inward. Although the damage was minor, the church remained closed until 1992 while restoration, as well as a bracing project to protect the building from future earthquakes, without changing the building&#x27;s decorations, was carried out. The university hired a team of contractors, structural engineers, architects, and conservation specialists to develop a renovation plan, which was paid for by a $10 million fundraising drive. Many donations came from undergraduates, and the university&#x27;s board of trustees approved the plan before its funding was in place because they recognized the church&#x27;s importance to Stanford.

In this restoration, the entire crossing was strengthened by bracing it behind the dome and securing it to the superstructure of the building. The restoration team evaluated every decoration in the church and made improvements and changes as necessary, in order to preserve the building&#x27;s interior elements. They also discovered that the crossing&#x27;s four large arches were hollow; they also found remnants of the steel frame that supported the original clock tower within a 20&quot; void space in the church&#x27;s arched walls. They had to fill the void with more than 470 tonnes of concrete and several layers of reinforcing steel in order to improve the walls&#x27; stability, an accomplishment the Alliance called &quot;one of the most challenging retrofit feats implemented at Stanford&quot;.

The roofs, which had not been replaced since 1913, were rebuilt with plywood diaphragms, 30,000 new red clay tiles were installed, and the stones from the decorative arches were reinserted. The wing of the damaged angel was restored; Stanford University hired William Kreysler and Associates to create a new backing system to secure this angel and three other mosaic angels to the base of the dome, which included replacing the original bonding materials (a weak lime mortar), with steel angles that anchored the mosaics to the walls and with a stronger polymer resin. The renovators found a piece of the original mosaic from the vestibule wall, which had a &quot;Chi Rho&quot; design, in the foundation, and inserted it into the Communion Table in the chancel, linking the current building with the pre-1906 church. The Victorian chandeliers were repaired and rewired, and the transept balconies, which had been closed for twenty years because they were declared unsafe, were reopened, after the false doors on the south side of each balcony were replaced by emergency exits and connected to existing staircases on the other side of the wall. A new sprinkler system and a new audio system was also installed. Stanford Memorial Church was rededicated by chaplain Robert C. Gregg on November 1, 1992.

=== Influence ===

According to Stanford professor Van Harvey, Stanford &quot;had the reputation of being a completely secular university&quot; before the 1950s, calling the period a &quot;background of aggressive secularism and the almost complete neglect of the academic study of religion&quot;. In 1946, Merrimon Cuninggim, a visiting chaplain at Stanford Memorial Church, criticized the serious lack of religious and spiritual resources available at Stanford for its students and criticized the university&#x27;s lack of academic courses offered in the study of religions. Cuninggim insisted that the university&#x27;s administration and trustees were responsible because they had interpreted the non-sectarian clause in Stanford&#x27;s charter in &quot;a negative and restrictive fashion rather than as enabling the tolerance and the flourishing of many religious faiths on campus&quot;.

Cuninggim also charged that Stanford&#x27;s religious policies were inadequate compared to other prominent U.S. universities. Two attempts were made to found a seminary to train pastors and religious leaders at Stanford, in 1921 and in 1940, but both failed. Harvey speculated that if Stanford had established a seminary like other prestigious universities, its religious studies department and the &quot;ethos&quot; of the entire institution would be different. In 1966, however, the university&#x27;s board of trustees got a court order that allowed them to change the non-sectarian clause in Stanford&#x27;s charter so that they could expand the university&#x27;s religious program, which included permitting sectarian worship services at Stanford Memorial Church.
Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes. Gardner&#x27;s successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion. In 1941 Trueblood&#x27;s efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion. By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying &quot;enormous success&quot;.

In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War. Leading this focus was Stanford Memorial Church Dean of the Chapel and Professor of Religion B. Davie Napier, who was &quot;a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam&quot;. Napier, along with Stanford professors Michael Novak and Robert McAfee Brown, who had previously been faculty members of seminaries, were the subject of a &quot;Time Magazine&quot; article in 1966, describing &quot;the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford&quot;. Students crowded into the church to hear anti-war speeches by them, as well as by &quot;notables&quot; such as Linus Pauling and William Sloan Coffin. Harvey credited Napier for making the church a popular meeting place on campus for undergraduates and for turning it into &quot;Christian theater—the introduction of jazz and other types of experimental worship as well as provocative preaching&quot;.

Stanford University was the first major educational institution in the United States that conducted same-sex commitment ceremonies at its chapel. Its first ceremony was held in 1993, and was officiated by Associate Dean Diana Akiyama. In 2017, a campus organization attempted to have Stanford Memorial Church declared a sanctuary church for the undocumented immigrant student population, but was unsuccessful due to university policies regarding the status of the church as part of the university.

=== Chaplains ===
Stanford Memorial Church, throughout its history, has been served by chaplains who have been influential amongst the Stanford University student body and community at large. R. Heber Newton, &quot;distinguished writer&quot; and former rector at All Souls Church in New York, was handpicked by Jane Stanford to serve as the church&#x27;s first pastor; he resigned after four months in 1903 &quot;because he disagreed with Mrs. Stanford on some aspects of church management&quot;. According to Stanford biographer Robert W. P. Cutler, &quot;Newton&#x27;s tenure had been a disappointment to Mrs. Stanford&quot;. David Charles Gardner, who replaced Newton, served the church from 1902 to his retirement in 1936. Stanford also handpicked Gardner as Newton&#x27;s assistant because she was impressed with his &quot;parish work&quot; in Palo Alto. Gardner went on to teach courses in Biblical history and literature at Stanford. Influential English professor and Stanford historian Edith R. Mirrielees called Gardner &quot;a preacher of only indifferent ability&quot;, but considered him &quot;a strength to the whole university&quot;. Mirrieless considered Gardner the prime mover behind the creation of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children, established in 1919, which eventually became the Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital.

D. Elton Trueblood, a lifelong Quaker, was the church&#x27;s chaplain from 1936 to 1946. Trueblood was also a professor of philosophy of religion at Stanford and established the university&#x27;s first major in religious studies; his tenure there provided him with &quot;the public visibility and financial freedom that made a national ministry possible&quot;. He wrote 33 books, including one about Abraham Lincoln. Trueblood and his wife hosted monthly Friends meetings in their home, and met weekly with Orthodox Jewish students in the vestry of Stanford Memorial Church. George J. Hall was the church&#x27;s chaplain from 1946 to 1947, followed by Paul C. Johnson, who served between 1949 and 1950. Robert M. Minto was chaplain twice, in 1947–1948, and again from 1950 to 1973. Minto, an associate chaplain at Stanford for two years prior, was a pastor in Scotland and a former British naval chaplain during World War II.

Stanford&#x27;s next two chaplains, B. Davie Napier (Dean of the chapel, 1966–72) and Robert McAfee Brown (Acting Dean of the chapel, 1972–73), were among the most politically active chaplains. Napier was an ordained Congregational minister. He was born in China to missionary parents, grew up in the American South, and went to seminary at Yale. He became known at Stanford &quot;for his efforts to relate Scripture to the turbulent political times of the late 1960s&quot;. Napier was a &quot;charismatic biblical scholar  ... [and] a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam&quot;. Napier was also a &quot;gifted&quot; preacher and jazz pianist. Brown, the author of 29 books, became &quot;an international leader in civil rights, ecumenical and social justice causes&quot;. He also protested U.S. involvement in Vietnam and taught religion and ethics in relation to contemporary life and literature.

Robert Hamerton-Kelly (1972–86), born in South Africa, was a United Methodist minister. He taught religion, classics, and Greek at Stanford. Thomas Ambrogi was acting dean for &quot;a challenging year&quot; in 1986. Robert C. Gregg (1987–98) was born in Texas and ordained as an Episcopal priest. He was also Professor of Religious Studies (now emeritus). Kelly Denton-Borhaug (1999–2000), a Lutheran minister, came to Stanford in 1996 as an associate dean. The Rev. Scotty McLennan (2001–2014), a Unitarian Universalist minister, was &quot;an activist neighborhood lawyer&quot; in Boston before becoming a university chaplain, first at Tufts University. Garry Trudeau, who was McLennan&#x27;s roommate when they were students at Yale University, based his Doonesbury character, the Rev. Scot Sloan, in part on McLennan. He was replaced by the Very Rev. Jane Shaw, an Episcopal priest and &quot;a historian of modern religion&quot;, in the fall of 2014.

==== Staff ====
Stanford Memorial Church is run by the Stanford Office for Religious Life, headed by the current Dean for Religious Life, Tiffany Steinwert. She replaced the Very Rev. Prof. Jane Shaw who was the dean for 4 years, 2014–18. Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann serves as Senior Associate Dean. Stanford has two associate deans: the Rev. Joanne Sanders and Sughra Ahmed.

Rabbi Karlin-Neumann is Stanford&#x27;s first associate dean from outside the Christian tradition. Before coming to Stanford, Karlin-Neumann had been a director and chaplain at UCLA, the Claremont Colleges, and Princeton, and was a rabbi in Alameda, California. She has taught courses in Jewish feminism, rabbinical ethics, education, and social justice. The university changed the title of her position to accommodate a Jewish rabbi, from &quot;Associate Dean of Memorial Church&quot; to &quot;Associate Dean of Religious Life at Stanford&quot;. She calls her title at Stanford &quot;Mem Chu and a Jew, too&quot;.

Joanne Sanders, an Episcopal priest, has worked at Stanford since 2000. She has degrees in theology, sports administration and physical education. She &quot;provides liturgical leadership for Memorial Church on campus for a variety of religious and other events&quot;.

Muslim dean Sughra Ahmed was appointed in 2017, for the purpose of, as Provost Persis Drell stated, to assist &quot;the Stanford community develop a broader understanding of the Islamic faith, particularly at this time&quot;. She was named Muslim Woman of the Year in the United Kingdom in 2014, and is a recognized Muslim leader.

Robert Huw Morgan, a native of Wales, has been Stanford Memorial Church&#x27;s organist since 1999. He attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was an organ scholar, and earned two doctorates at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he served on staff as a pianist and conductor. At Stanford, he serves as a lecturer in organ, director of the Stanford University Singers, and director of the Memorial Church Choir.

==Murder of Arlis Perry==
Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old who lived on-campus, was murdered there on October 12, 1974.

== Architecture ==

Stanford Memorial Church is part of a linked, complex system of arcades that make up the Quad, which serves to unify the entire complex, is more reminiscent of European public spaces than American ones, and &quot;is probably one of the most important feature of the original Stanford architecture&quot;. It was built during the American Renaissance period. Gregg called the church &quot;a perfect example of the movement&quot;, with elements of the Renaissance, Byzantine and Medieval art, the Romanesque period, and the Pre-Raphaelites. The architectural style of Stanford Memorial Church has been referred to as &quot;a stunning example of late Victorian ecclesiastical art and architecture with echoes of Pre-Raphaelitism&quot;. Stanford historian Richard Joncas called the church &quot;an opulent example of high Victorian architecture with sumptuous materials and arts&quot;.

The original designs for Memorial Church and much of the university were made in 1886 by prominent American architect Henry Hobson Richardson; when he died that same year, his student Charles A. Coolidge completed them. Coolidge loosely based his design of Memorial Church on Richardson&#x27;s design of Trinity Church in Boston. The church&#x27;s heavy red tile roofs, round turrets, low arches, and rough-hewn stonework matches the design of other buildings in the Quad. After Jane Stanford&#x27;s legal difficulties after her husband&#x27;s death were resolved, she hired San Francisco architect Clinton E. Day to review and update the church&#x27;s blueprints. Charles E. Hodges was the supervising architect for the project. Jane Stanford hired builder John McGilvray, who was responsible for constructing the St. Francis Hotel, the City Hall complex in San Francisco, and much of Stanford University, for the actual construction of Stanford Memorial Church.
Jane Stanford&#x27;s taste and knowledge of both contemporary and classical art is evident in several aspects of the plan, appearance, and architecture of the church, which &quot;dazzle the eye yet also produce an atmosphere of quiet contemplation&quot;. According to Joncas, &quot;the church emulates the &#x27;glorious color&#x27; of the great European cathedrals&quot;, especially those in Italy. Although the iconography in the church is Christian, Stanford was a &quot;late Victorian progressive&quot;, and chose the art less for its religious themes and more for its &quot;humanitarian ethics&quot;. She requested that the designs include women, &quot;to show the uplifting influence of religion for women&quot;; Architectural historian Willis L. Hall claims that there are more depictions of women than in most church imagery at the time. Art historian Judy Oberhausen reports that Stanford used compendium of biblical illustrations like &quot;The Story of the Bible&quot; by Charles Foster, which contained 300 illustrations and summarized the events and stories she wished to depict in the church&#x27;s windows and mosaics.

Jane Stanford&#x27;s design included inspirational messages placed throughout the church in the form of inscriptions carved into its walls and enclosed in carved frameworks. As Barbara Palmer of the &quot;Stanford Report&quot; stated, Stanford &quot;had her religious beliefs literally carved into the church&#x27;s sandstone walls&quot;. For example, the following quotations can be found in the church&#x27;s east transept:

Religion is intended as a comfort, a solace, a necessity to the soul&#x27;s welfare; and whichever form of religion furnishes the greatest comfort, the greatest solace, it is the form which should be adopted be its name what it will.

The best form of religion is trust in God, and a firm belief in the immortality of the soul, life everlasting.

=== Plan ===
The church is a cruciform structure; its original structure, which included a clock and bell tower with an 80-foot (24 m) spire, was long and wide. The facade faces the Inner Quad, and is connected to other buildings by arcades which extend laterally. The entry is through a narthex or vestibule extending across the building. The nave has a single aisle on either side, separated by an arcade with a clerestory above it. The crossing is formed by a structure of square plan which once supported the central tower. Over it is a shallow dome supported on pendentives and rising to a skylit oculus. High semicircular Romanesque arches separate the crossing from the nave, transepts and chancel. The chancel and transepts are apsidal. There are deep galleries with concave balustraded fronts in the transepts and an organ gallery above the narthex. The sanctuary, in the chancel, is elevated and approached by steps. A round-shaped room is at the back of the building, added in 1902 by architect Clinton Day.

=== Exterior ===
The chief building material of the church is buff sandstone, which came from the Goodrich Quarry (also called the Greystone Quarry) in the Almaden area of San Jose, was delivered by train and rough-cut in the university Quad. Gregg credits the high quality of the stonework to church and university builder John D. McGilvray. The church is roofed with terracotta tiles of the Italian imbrex and tegula form. The nave, chancel, and transepts appear to project from the square central structure, roofed with tiles and a small skylight above its center. Memorial Church originally had a central bell tower with an 80-foot tall, twelve-sided spire, but this was lost as a result of the 1906 earthquake.

The church&#x27;s facade is surmounted by a simple Celtic cross, a motif that appears several times throughout the building. The cross was added after the 1906 earthquake; its central shaft was destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake and replaced. There are three arched entrances below the exterior mosaic; the central one is slightly larger than the others. The surrounding stonework is intricately carved with stylized flora, twisted-cable moldings, and bosses of sculpted cherubim, a motif which occurs in different media throughout the church. In the spandrels are mosaic depictions of the biblical concepts of love, faith, hope and charity intertwined in a vine representing the &quot;tree of life&quot;.

In the upper zone of the facade, surrounded by more elaborate stonework and &quot;lacy carving&quot;, is a large central window, with groups of three smaller windows on each side. The original central window was a quatrefoil-shaped rose window, but after the 1906 earthquake, it was replaced by a &quot;classical round-head window that more grandly restates the smaller flanking, articulated openings&quot; and that corresponded with the mission-style architecture of the Quad. Beneath the windows are inlaid panels of colored marble.

The gable and surrounding surfaces contain the church&#x27;s largest mosaic, created by Maurizio Camerino&#x27;s studio, which they rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake. Measuring wide at the base and in height, at the time of its completion, it was the largest mosaic in the U.S. It depicts a group of men, women and children, 47 in all, surrounding and &quot;paying close heed&quot; to Christ, the mosaic&#x27;s central figure, and includes a landscape with &quot;waving palms and a gleaming sky&quot; behind Christ. The exterior mosaic took 12 men two years to complete.

After Jane Stanford&#x27;s death, the mosaic popularly gained the name &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, although Stanford University historian Richard Joncas insists that the mosaic does not depict the scene as described in the Gospel of Matthew and has referred to it as &quot;an indefinite biblical scene&quot;. In the Stanford University press release about the 1992 gift of three watercolor studies for the church&#x27;s mosaics, Paoletti&#x27;s design for the facade is described as &quot;Christ Welcoming the Righteous into the Kingdom of God&quot;, based on Matthew 25:34. Paoletti created another unfinished watercolor depicting &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, as another option for the facade mosaic, but it was evidently rejected by Stanford.

=== Interior ===

Jane Stanford has been described as having a &quot;Victorian aversion to blank space&quot; and so created a church that is &quot;a dimly lit cavern of glowing mosaic surfaces ... and vibrant, stained-glass windows&quot;. The church is richly decorated throughout, its architectural features carved with formalized foliate ornament, and the walls adorned with mosaics in the Byzantine manner. Even though the church was dedicated in 1903, interior decoration took another two years to complete, with the installation of the mosaics and the carving of the extensive quotations on the walls occurring simultaneously. There are 29 large carvings of quatrefoils that contain ancient religious symbols in the walls of church&#x27;s west and east transepts. The stained-glass windows were crafted by J. and R. Lamb of New York. Its exposed-timber ceilings are modeled after Boston&#x27;s Trinity Church.

The church is entered through three bronze doors adorned with angels, a recurring motif throughout the church. The doors open up into a narthex or vestibule decorated with mosaics on the walls, illuminated by the many colors of the stained glass windows, and stone carvings on the architectural details. There is a variety of styles and motifs reflecting the hands of different craftsmen. The mosaic that adorns the floor depicts the Lamb of God surrounded by the symbols of the four gospel writers: St. Matthew (the winged angel), St. Mark (the winged lion), St. Luke (the ox), and St. John (the eagle). Some of these symbols also appear in other areas of the church. A Celtic cross adorns the stained glass above the central wooden door that leads into the nave, and Latin epigraphs have been engraved above the two side doors.

Above the narthex is an organ gallery. The nave is arcaded and has a single aisle on each side with clerestory windows above. Its walls, from the floor to the top of the clerestory, are decorated with 15 murals made of mosaics on each side, and depicts scenes from the Old Testament. The exposed timber ceiling was inspired by Trinity Church and is constructed with tied hammer beams, which can be seen radiating in the chancel. The floor of the church slopes downward towards the crossing. The chancel and transepts are three semi-circular apses. They are separated from the broad central space by large semi-circular arches on stout columns with carved capitals. The transept apses each have a balcony with a concave balustrade.

Directly above the crossing is a dome supported on pendentives. Around the base of the dome are decorative gilt bands, the lower depicting a scrolling vine. Jane Stanford intended the dome&#x27;s decoration to be of mosaic tiles showing a variety of symbols, but the church&#x27;s builders thought it would make the dome too heavy, so the decorations were painted. On the spandrels of the pendentives are mosaics of four angels measuring from wing tip to wing tip, rising from clouds. The angels survived the 1906 earthquake, but the angel looking downward was severely damaged during the 1989 earthquake because an 8-foot section of its left wing fell .

The chancel, according to Hall, contains &quot;artistic work of a kind seldom seen anywhere&quot;. The raised tiled floor of the chancel curves outward into the body of the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The sanctuary is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara marble by L.M. Avenali. The altar supports a &quot;simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it.&quot; The cross was made by William van Erp and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.
Behind the altar is a mosaic reproduction of Rosselli&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;. Around the lower walls of the chancel are twelve niches decorated with golden mosaic tiles. They hold candles, but originally held statues of the twelve apostles, destroyed in 1906 and were never replaced. According to local legend, the cherubim carved in stone above the golden niches and in the pillars&#x27; capitals are illustrations of children living on campus at the time of the church&#x27;s construction. To the west side of the chancel stands brass lectern in the form of a reading angel, which Jane Stanford brought from Europe and dedicated to her husband on the anniversary of his birth in 1902.

Three stained glass windows in the apse depict the nativity, crucifixion, and ascension of Christ. The mosaics between them show angels, those on the left carrying a cross, those on the right carrying a crown. On the longer sections of the chancel wall, on either side of the windows, are mosaics depicting a choir of angels. Above them is a tier of mosaics with representations of the prophets and kings of Israel. Other mosaics abound in the transepts, clerestory, and the choir loft at the northern end of the church. A series of mosaics in the upper transepts depict Old Testament figures on the east side and Christian saints on the west side. On Jane Stanford&#x27;s direction, they alternate male and female.

The arches, balcony rails, and pillars throughout the church have relief carvings created by a team of 10 men who worked for two years from scaffolding. A large double pillar before the entrance of the west transept have inscriptions dedicated to members of the Stanford family. After the 1989 earthquake, a third of the west transept was converted into a small chapel. The altar and chairs in this chapel were designed by Bay Area artist Gail Fredell who decorated the chapel&#x27;s altar by using Salvatti&#x27;s original mosaics, which had been stored since the church&#x27;s reconstruction following the 1906 earthquake.

==== Windows ====
According to architectural historian Willis L. Hall, the church&#x27;s 20 large stained glass windows &quot;are as much a feature of the church as the mosaics&quot;. The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1862–1928) and fabricated by J&amp;R Lamb Studios, his father&#x27;s firm in New York City, took three years to complete, and eight months to install at Stanford. Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in &quot;the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work&quot;. The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest commission awarded to an American stained glass artist at the time, and the project is &quot;considered the finest example of Lamb&#x27;s work&quot;. The window have a different appearance when viewed from the outside of the building because the reflected light highlights the textures of the glass panels, created by using many layers of different colored glass.

Stanford chose the life of Christ for the windows&#x27; theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as Frederic Shields and Gustave Doré. The windows have a section at the bottom with the scriptural quotations their images depict; the larger windows also include their titles. Stanford&#x27;s personal touch is shown in one of the nave windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of Leland Stanford Jr., the Stanfords&#x27; only child and the university&#x27;s namesake, who died in 1884 of typhoid shortly before his 16th birthday.

Oberhausen, who has studied the source of the mosaics and windows, states that at least four stained glass windows were inspired by the paintings of Pre-Raphaelite artists that were enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the time. These windows are: &quot;Christ in the Temple&quot; in the east transept, based upon a painting by William Holman Hunt; &quot;The Annunciation&quot; in the east nave, inspired by a work by Frederic Shields; &quot;The Nativity&quot; in the chancel, based upon a painting by Edward Fellowes-Prynne; and &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; in the west transept, inspired by a painting by Sibyl C. Parker, the only female artist represented in the artwork of the church. None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required replacement after the 1906 quake, except for &quot;the famous rose window of the original structure&quot; in the organ loft which was replaced by the current large, central arch window. This window, entitled &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;, is the only window in the church that cannot be viewed from the inside because it is blocked off by the central organ. There is a cross in the center of this window made of &quot;faceted pieces of glass that are inset like gems&quot;, which sparkle when light strikes it.

The church&#x27;s clerestory contains many smaller windows of individuals from the Bible or Christian history. The windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following Old Testament figures: Abraham, Hagar and her child Ishmael, Moses, Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter, Joshua, and Deborah. The windows in the east transept depict David, Ruth, Solomon, The Queen of Sheba, Elijah, Esther, Isaiah, Judith, Daniel, and Hannah. In the nave above the west arcade feature saints and virtues: Stephen, Agnes, Peter, Priscilla, John, and Hope. In the west transept are Simeon, Anne, Matthew, Faith, Mark, Charity, Luke, Dorcas, Paul, and Martha. The clerestory above the east and west doors are two windows of angels. Unlike the other windows throughout the church, they do not receive natural light from outside and are artificially illuminated instead.






==== Mosaics ====
The mosaics that decorate Stanford Memorial Church, which Taylor considers &quot;a perfect complement to Frederick Lamb&#x27;s stained-glass windows&quot;, are &quot;virtually everywhere&quot; inside the church. According to Gregg, Jane Stanford came up with the idea, calling it &quot;idiosyncratic by some architectural historians&quot;, of extensively decorating Memorial Church&#x27;s interior and facade, similar in style to the mosaics in many of the churches she and her husband admired during their travels in Europe. One of the reasons she chose mosaics was because of the similar weather in Italy and Northern California, where the moderate climates and rainy seasons in both settings protect the images from erosion and clear the pollution that accumulates on many buildings in large cities. As Hall states, the &quot;mosaics on the facade are always clear and brilliant.&quot; During the Stanfords&#x27; 1883 tour of Europe, they visited Byzantine churches in Constantinople and St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. They met and befriended Maurizio Camerino, the manager of the Antonio Salviati studios, which had just completed restoring the mosaics at St Mark&#x27;s.

Stanford began working with Camerino, who by that time had bought the Salviati studios, in 1899, and spent two months in Venice in the fall of 1900, selecting the watercolors created as the mosaics&#x27; patterns by Camerino&#x27;s chief designer, Antonio Paoletti. Camerino&#x27;s firm worked exclusively on the Stanford mosaics for three years; the project, which included the mosaics created for the university museum, was the largest mosaic project in the U.S. at the time. Stanford worked closely with Paoletti, planning a combination of Old Testament and New Testament scenes that represented men and women equally.

The mosaic project began in 1900, took five years to complete, and cost US$97,000. The &quot;shimmering quality&quot; of the mosaics, which resemble tapestry, were created by different tones of green and gold; the artists that installed them had over 20,000 shades of colors to choose from. Paoletti&#x27;s watercolors were divided into two-foot-square sections, which were made into glass by other artists in Venice. The mosaics were then shipped in pieces by boat to New York and then by railroad to California, where they were placed on the church&#x27;s walls. Artisan Lorenzo Zampato was given the task of supervising the in-studio fabrication and final installation at Stanford, which took 4 years to complete.

The mosaic adorning the church&#x27;s chancel is a reproduction of Rosselli&#x27;s fresco of the Last Supper from the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. Camerino obtained permission from Pope Leo XIII to reproduce it at Stanford Memorial Church. Unlike other works, which were reproduced frequently, it was the only reproduction of Rosselli&#x27;s fresco at the time. There are 12 mosaics in each transept balcony that are split into two sets of six, creating an arc of six mosaics, ten windows, and six mosaics. Most of the church&#x27;s mosaics were made from 1/8-inch tiles; larger 3/4-inch tiles were used on the higher mosaics, and smaller 1/4-inch tiles were used in &quot;The Last Supper&quot; mosaic.
==== Organs ====
Stanford Memorial Church houses five organs, a &quot;situation only a few places in the nation can boast&quot;. The presence of high-quality organs makes Stanford an ideal location for accomplished musicians, and the sanctuary one of California&#x27;s best settings for instrumental and choral performance. The church&#x27;s organist is Robert Huw Morgan.

Stanford Memorial Church&#x27;s first organ, the 1901 Murray Harris, named for its builder Murray M. Harris, sits in the upstairs gallery and is still in use. Damaged in the 1906 earthquake, the organ was rebuilt in 1925, enlarged in 1933, and thoroughly restored in 1996. It features three manuals (keyboards for the hands), 57 stops, and over 3,700 pipes. The Murray Harris plays music from the Romantic period; its sound has been described as &quot;romantic [and] undulating&quot; and &quot;like a low-decibel airplane engine revving up&quot; Morgan compares the Murray Harris to both a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley.

The Fisk-Nanney organ, which many consider one of the best organs in the world, was built in 1985 and is also housed in the church&#x27;s upstairs gallery. It is named after its builder, Charles Brenton Fisk, and for Herbert Nanney, who was the church&#x27;s organist for 39 years. Although it was commissioned in 1973, its completion was delayed for many years, due to logistical, financial, and construction issues. The organ&#x27;s case is made of poplar wood and its almost 4,500 pipes are made of varying sizes of lead and tin. Its keyboards, which Morgan calls the &quot;flight deck,&quot; are made with grenadilla, with rosewood making up its natural and sharps, and are capped with bone. The organ&#x27;s keyboards are black on white, instead of the modern white on black. The stop controls create &quot;a huge array of sounds&quot;.

The Fisk-Nanney is a four-manual Baroque-type organ with 73 ranks. It uses a &quot;combination of elements from historic East German, North German, and French organs plus dual temperaments&quot;, and is &quot;the first instrument in the history of organ building that is capable of reproducing nearly all organ music written from the 16th through the 18th centuries&quot;. The organ, which &quot;has remarkable complexity&quot;, features both French- and German-style reeds and principal choruses. It is equipped with a Brustpositiv division in meantone temperament. A lever allows the remaining divisions to alternate between well temperament and meantone temperament, a feature made possible by the inclusion of five extra pipes (two for each sharp key) per octave.

Morgan describes the organ&#x27;s sound as &quot;delicious&quot; and &quot;visceral&quot;, ringing with &quot;&#x27;incredible clarity&#x27; and &#x27;dark color&#x27;&quot;, and compares it to driving a Maserati. He insists that the best place to listen to the Fisk-Nanny is not upstairs in the gallery where it sits, but in the church, &quot;about halfway down the nave&quot;. In 2005 Morgan performed the complete organ works of Dieterich Buxtehude during a series of recitals, eight hours in all, to celebrate the organ&#x27;s 20th anniversary. During the 2009–2010 school year, Morgan commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Fisk-Nanney organ and his 10th year at Stanford in a concert series of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach, which took 18 hours to complete.

Memorial Church&#x27;s third organ, the Katherine Potter-Brinegar organ, was built in 1995 and was named for the spouse of Stanford alumni Claude S. Brinegar. It &quot;further enhances&quot; the diversity of the organs in Stanford Memorial Church, and was inspired by a famous chamber organ designed by German organ maker Esias Compenius in 1610. It is self-contained, with its blower and bellows encased in its walnut case, and has hidden, retractable wheels that allow it to moved anywhere in the church. It is a single-manual organ; most of its pipework is made of different types of wood, and has 8 speaking stops, 3 of which are made of reed pipes. Its sound has been described as &quot;relaxed and refined to the listener&quot;.

The continuo organ built by Martin Pasi of Roy, Washington was acquired in June 2001. It contains three stops. The case and most of its pipes are made of walnut, and its keys are made of ebony and English boxwood.

In 2010 the church received on long-term loan a five-rank Tudor-style organ built by Hupalo &amp; Repasky Pipe Organs. It is a recreation based upon the work of English organ builders and restorers Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn and of the discovery in 1995 of the upper boards, grid, and table of a rare English organ, one of only three out of the five organs of the type in existence. It is a &quot;small but tonally versatile&quot; organ typical of the Tudor era of the 16th century.

The Tudor organ&#x27;s 200 pipes are made from metals with high tin content, and its façade pipes have been gilded and embossed. Its case, which was inspired by organ cases in churches in Wales and Stanford-on-Avon, is made of stained white oak, with hand-carved panels of linen fold and Tudor rose (inspired by the Tudor rose on Shrewsbury Tower at St. John&#x27;s College in Cambridge) carvings. The Tudor&#x27;s keys are made of European pear wood; its sharps are made of ebony. It has two large feeder bellows that supply the organ&#x27;s wind. The organ&#x27;s sound is &quot;surprisingly full and has a singing bell-like quality&quot;.

== Services and facilities ==

Although the Stanfords were religious and viewed &quot;spiritual and moral values as essential to a young person&#x27;s education and future citizenship&quot;, they were not formally committed to any Christian denomination. As a result, Jane Stanford decreed, from the beginning of Stanford Memorial Church&#x27;s history, that the church be non-denominational. She believed that adopting this philosophy would &quot;serve the broadest spiritual needs of the university community&quot;. The church&#x27;s first chaplain, Charles Gardner, declared on the day of its dedication that the church&#x27;s goal was to serve the spiritual needs of the university in a non-sectarian way. The Stanfords&#x27; goal was that moral instruction would occur at the church, as demonstrated in the inscriptions carved into its walls, which was influenced by the late 19th-century liberal Protestantism they embraced. As former Stanford chaplain Robert C. Gregg states, &quot;The Stanfords sought to protect free intellectual inquiry—in classroom, laboratory, and church—from any interference prompted by the caution or dogmatism of religious authorities&quot;.

Stanford Memorial Church was the earliest and has been &quot;among the most prominent&quot; non-denominational churches on the West Coast of the United States. Multi-faith services are held at Stanford Memorial Church, in addition to denominational and non-denominational Christian services. As many as 150 weddings or renewal ceremonies take place in the church each year, for current and former students and their children or grandchildren, for Stanford faculty and staff members, and for others connected to the university. Memorial services, conducted by Stanford&#x27;s dean and other chaplain officials, for students, alumni, faculty, and staff are also conducted at the church.

Members of the university community use Memorial Church for &quot;quiet, for reflection, and for private devotions&quot;. Catholic masses are held in the church several times a week.

<text>Nicholas Lamert Luard (26 June 1937 Hampstead, London – 25 May 2004 Kensington, London) was a writer and politician.

==Background==

He was educated at Winchester College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read English and was taught by F. R. Leavis. He met Peter Cook through &quot;Footlights&quot;. A very short academic career was replaced by club management on the strength of a legacy. He co-founded The Establishment in the early 1960s with Peter Cook.

He then went into writing. He was one of the Lords Gnome of &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

With Chris Brasher, Nigel Hawkins and Denis Mollison, he founded the John Muir Trust in 1983. Nick served as chairman from 1991 to 1997.

Luard stood as a candidate for the Referendum Party in the 1997 general election, against Michael Portillo in Enfield Southgate.

Luard married Elisabeth Longmore, the food writer, in 1962.

<text>Glenlair, near the village of Corsock in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire, in Dumfries and Galloway, was the home of the physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879). The original structure was designed for Maxwell&#x27;s father by Walter Newall; Maxwell himself oversaw the construction of an extension in the late 1860s, and further improvements were made by his heir, Andrew Wedderburn-Maxwell. A fire in 1929 left the house gutted, but a project to preserve and stabilise the remains has been undertaken by the Maxwell at Glenlair Trust.

<text>William Holabird (September 11, 1854 in Amenia, New York – July 19, 1923 in Evanston, Illinois) was an American architect.

Holabird was the son of General Samuel B. Holabird and Mary Theodosia Grant. He studied at the United States Military Academy at West Point but resigned and moved to Chicago, where he later got married.

He worked in the architectural practice of William Le Baron Jenney next to O. C. Simonds. Shortly after receiving the commission to extend Graceland Cemetery, Jenney passed it on to his assistants who, in 1880, established the firm of Holabird &amp; Simonds to carry out this job. In 1881, Martin Roche, who had also worked in Jenney&#x27;s office, joined them as a third partner. In 1883 the firm was renamed Holabird &amp; Roche after Simonds left to concentrate solely on Graceland Cemetery and landscape design.
Together they contributed many innovations to the architecture of the time, especially in what is now referred to as Chicago School. They designed several influential buildings, including the Marquette Building and the Gage Building. The latter included a façade designed by Louis Sullivan and was cited a Chicago architectural landmark in 1962.

William Holabird died in 1923, and Martin Roche died in 1927. Holabird&#x27;s son John took over the firm with John Wellborn Root Jr., and it was renamed Holabird &amp; Root.

William&#x27;s sister, Agnes Holabird Von Kurowsky, was the mother of Agnes von Kurowsky. His daughter Mary was the wife of General William Mackey Cruikshank.

<text>DIGITALEUROPE is a European trade association that represents the digital technology industry. It is led by the Director General.

The members include 105 major technology companies and 41 national trade associations. It seeks to ensure industry participation in the development and implementation of EU policies&quot; and has several working groups that focus on different aspects of policy—environment, trade, technical and regulatory and the digital economy. Based in Brussels, Belgium, DIGITALEUROPE represents over 45,000 companies.

== History ==
DIGITALEUROPE was formed in 1999 as the European Information and Communications Technology Industry Association (EICTA) by consolidating two former European organisations, ECTEL and EUROBIT, which represented the information and telecommunications industries. EICTA expanded its scope to include the consumer electronics industry; on October 1, 2001, the association merged with the European Association of Consumer Electronics Manufacturers (EACEM). The new joint association changed its name to the European Information, Communications and Consumer Electronics Technology Industry Association (but kept its original acronym, EICTA).

On March 12, 2009, EICTA rebranded as DIGITALEUROPE. Overtime, its membership has expanded to include vertical industries such as healthcare, finance and manufacturing.

==Logos==
DIGITALEUROPE previously developed the industry standards related to high-definition televisions.

On September 5, 2014, DIGITALEUROPE released an Ultra HD TV logo to certify companies that meet their technical requirements. The technical requirements for the Ultra HD logo is that the display must have a resolution of at least 3840×2160, a video signal path that does not reduce the resolution, a minimum color space of Rec. 709, and HDMI input that supports HDCP 2.2 content protection.

==Policy positions==
In November 2014, it published a paper called &quot;Law Enforcement Access to Data in the European Cloud&quot; that asks the European Commission to &quot;consider filing an amicus brief&quot; with a U.S. appellate court regarding Microsoft&#x27;s legal challenge of a U.S. warrant for a Microsoft user&#x27;s private emails. As DIGITALEUROPE sees it, the fact that the data requested is stored on servers located in Dublin, Ireland, means that U.S. authorities should use mutual legal assistance treaties rather than strong-arming a U.S. multinational, which raises concerns about national sovereignty.

In anticipation to the publication of Neelie Kroes&#x27;s Digital Agenda, DigitalEurope released a paper in May 2010 about Europe&#x27;s digital future which was called A Transformational Agenda for the Digital Age DigitalEurope&#x27;s Vision 2020.

<doc id="1190328" wikidata="Q691956" url="?curid=1190328" title="Socket 754">
<text>Socket 754 is a CPU socket originally developed by AMD to supersede its Athlon XP platform (Socket A, also referred to as Socket 462). Socket 754 was one of the first sockets developed by AMD to support their new 64-bit microprocessor family known as AMD64, this time for the consumer market.

==Technical specifications==

Socket 754 was the original socket for AMD&#x27;s Athlon 64 desktop processors. Due to the introduction of newer socket layouts (i.e. Socket 939 and Socket AM2), Socket 754 became the more &quot;budget-minded&quot; socket for use with AMD Athlon 64 or Sempron processors. It differs from Socket 939 in several areas:
* support for a single channel memory controller (64 bits wide) with a maximum of three unbuffered DIMMs, or four registered DIMMs
* no dual channel support
* lower HyperTransport speed (800 MHz Bi-Directional, 16 bit data path, up and downstream)

* lower motherboard manufacturing costs

Although AMD promoted Socket 754 as a budget platform on the desktop and encouraged mid- and high-end users to use newer platforms, Socket 754 remained for some time as AMD&#x27;s high-end solution for mobile applications (e.g. the HP zv6000 series). However in 2006, Socket S1 was released and superseded Socket 754 in the mobile CPU segment, with support for dual-core CPUs and DDR2 SDRAM.

== Heatsink ==
The 2 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard are placed at a distance of 90 mm.

==Availability==

The first processors using Socket 754 came on the market in the second half of 2003. Socket 754 was phased out in favor of Socket 939 on desktops because of low sales. The socket remained in use for laptops until it was replaced by Socket S1 in 2006.

<text>Martin Roche (1853–1927) was an American architect.

== Life ==
In partnership with William Holabird, Martin Roche designed buildings following the Chicago School and that were landmarks in the development of early sky scrapers. He worked for William Le Baron Jenney until 1881 when he joined William Holabird at Holabird &amp; Simonds. One of their first commissions was Graceland Cemetery. Ossian Simonds left the practice in 1883 to concentrate on landscape design, and the firm was renamed Holabird &amp; Roche.

Together they contributed many innovations to the Chicago School including the Chicago School windows, which allowed more sunlight into office buildings. They designed buildings including the Marquette Building, the Cable Building (1899) and the Gage Building (1899).

Roche was a fine designer with an eye for Gothic architecture. He designed the world&#x27;s first Gothic-style skyscraper for the University Club of Chicago, which opened in 1908. Later, the firm designed the neoclassical Soldier Field (1924).

William Holabird died in 1923 and Martin Roche followed four years later. Holabird&#x27;s son John took over the firm with John Root Jr., and it was renamed Holabird &amp; Root.

<doc id="1190332" wikidata="Q7016132" url="?curid=1190332" title="1938 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1938 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 26th term. It resulted in the governing Labour Party being re-elected in a landslide, winning nearly 56% of the vote despite not gaining any more seats. Having replaced the United-Reform coalition, the newly founded National Party also gained a certain amount of ground.

This was the first election in which the Māori were given a secret ballot which had been available to white voters since 1870.

==Background==
The Labour Party had won a resounding victory in the 1935 elections, winning fifty-three seats. Shortly after the elections, the two Ratana-aligned MPs also merged into the Labour Party, giving Labour a total of fifty-five seats. The government, a coalition of the United Party and the Reform Party, had won only nineteen seats. Shortly after their defeat, United and Reform agreed to merge into the National Party, which positioned itself as the only alternative to the &quot;socialist&quot; Labour Party. However, Labour remained popular with the public, and the Prime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage, was widely praised for his welfare reform. The leadership of the National Party, by contrast, was closely associated by the public with the Great Depression, and struggled to gain traction.

==The election==
The date for the main 1938 elections was 15 October, a Saturday. Elections to the four Maori electorates were held the day before. 995,173 people were registered to vote, and there was a turnout of 92.9%. This turnout was the highest ever recorded at that point, although it was later exceeded in the two elections after World War II and in the 1984 elections. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.

==Results==
The 1938 election saw a decisive win for the governing Labour Party, which won fifty-three seats. This was a drop of two from what it held prior to the election. While Labour gained the seats of Bay of Islands, Motueka (previously held by Keith Holyoake), New Plymouth, Wellington Suburbs, and Northern Maori, it lost Tauranga and the rural seats of Manawatu, Rangitikei, Waikato, Mid-Canterbury, and Waipawa.

The National Party won twenty-five seats, an increase of six from that the United–Reform Coalition had previously won. Both Labour and National increased their share of the popular vote, with Labour winning 55.8% (up from 46.1%) and National winning 40.3% (up from 32.9%). This increase was at the expense of the Democrat Party (who had merged into National in 1936) and the agrarian monetary reformist Country Party, which saw its votes collapse completely. The Country Party lost the two seats it held ( and ) as, unlike 1935, Labour stood candidates in the seats held by the two Country Party members. Hence Harold Rushworth did not stand in the Bay of Islands seat, and Arthur Sexton came third in Franklin.

Independent candidates also lost ground, with only two being elected, Harry Atmore () and Charles Wilkinson (). As in 1935, the independents were tactically supported by one of the major parties who did not stand a candidate against them, and they generally voted with that party; Wilkinson and Wright had supported National while Atmore had supported Labour. But Robert Wright was defeated for the new electorate of Wellington West by Labour despite National not running a candidate against him.

An analysis of men and women on the rolls against the votes recorded showed that in the 1938 election 92.85% of those on the European rolls voted; men 93.43% and women 92.27%. In the the figures were 90.75% with men 92.02% and women 89.46%. As the Māori electorates did not have electoral rolls they could not be included.

This was the first election in which the Māori were given a secret ballot. Secret ballots had been available to white voters since 1870, but it was not extended to Māori voters until the 1937 Electoral Amendment Act was passed. The number of votes cast in the Māori seats in the 1938 election rose 18.3% from the 1935 election. Opponents of the secret ballot for the Māori claimed that the Māori suffered from illiteracy, but only 2.28% of the ballots were ruled invalid. Member of Parliament Eruera Tirikatene praised the secret ballot for the Māori as he regarded it as one of the rights promised in the Treaty of Waitangi.

<text>Novorossiysk (, ; ) is a city in Krasnodar Krai, Russia. It is one of the largest ports on the Black Sea. It is one of the few cities designated by the Soviet Union as a Hero City. The population was 

==History==
In antiquity, the shores of the Tsemes Bay were the site of Bata (), an ancient Greek colony that specialized in the grain trade. It is mentioned in the works of Strabo and Ptolemy, among others.

Following brief periods of Roman and Khazar control, from the 9th century onwards, the area was part of the Byzantine θέμα Χερσῶνος &quot;Thema Khersonos&quot; (Province of Cherson).

During the 11th century, the area was overrun and controlled by nomads from the Eurasian steppe, led by the Cumans. Later that century, the Byzantine emperor Ἀλέξιος Κομνηνός Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) was approached by Anglo-Saxon refugees, who had left England following the Norman conquest. Alexios offered land to these refugees in &quot;Thema Khersonos&quot; if they could recapture it from the nomads and there is contemporaneous evidence that a Byzantine-English colony was subsequently founded. For example, medieval nautical charts mention place names on the Kuban coast with possible English origins, including a port (located within or near the future site of Novorossiysk) known as Susaco (or &quot;Susacho&quot;) – a name that may have been derived from Sussex. (The same maps also show, north-west of &quot;Susaco&quot;, a river &quot;Londia&quot;, which may derive its name from London.)

In the 15th century, Genoese merchants from the Ghisolfi family maintained a trade outpost in the area. A 2007 archaeological investigation of related sites discovered some interesting items.

From 1722, the bay was controlled by an Ottoman fortress (&quot;qale&quot;) named Sujuk (also transliterated &quot;Sudzhuk&quot;, &quot;Sudschuk&quot; and &quot;Soğucak&quot;). This name may be derived from &quot;Susaco&quot; (see above) and, as late as 1769, the area was sometimes named in European maps as &quot;Suzako&quot;.

The coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War. After this, admirals Mikhail Lazarev and Nikolay Raevsky founded an eastern base for the Black Sea Fleet on the shore in 1838. Named after the province of Novorossiya, the port formed a vital link in the chain of forts known as the Black Sea Coastal Line, which stretched south to Sochi.

During the rest of the 19th century, Novorossiysk developed rapidly. It was granted city status in 1866 and became the capital of the Novorossiysk Okrug and Black Sea Governorate, the smallest in the Russian Empire, in 1896. In December 1905, the city was the seat of the short-lived Novorossiysk Republic. From August 26, 1918, until March 27, 1920, the city was used as the principal center of Denikin&#x27;s White Army during the Russian Civil War. Denikin&#x27;s South Russian Government was moved to Crimea and many Whites escaped from Novorossiysk to Constantinople during the Evacuation of Novorossiysk (1920), with the help of Allied warships.

During World War II, most of the city was occupied by the German and Romanian Armies on September 10, 1942. A small unit of Soviet sailors defended one part of the city, known as Malaya Zemlya, for 225 days beginning on February 4, 1943, and the town was liberated by the Red Army on September 16, 1943. The heroic defense of the port by the sailors allowed the Soviets to retain possession of the city&#x27;s bay, which prevented the Axis from using the port for supply shipments. Novorossiysk was awarded the title Hero City in 1973.

In 1960, the town was commemorated in Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s work &quot;Novorossiysk Chimes, the Flame of Eternal Glory&quot; (Opus 111b).

In 2003, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree setting up a naval base for the Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk. Russia has allocated 12.3 billion rubles (about $480 million) for the construction of the new base between 2007 and 2012. The construction of other facilities and infrastructure at the base, including units for coastal troops, aviation and logistics, will continue beyond 2012. Russia planned to move the Black Sea Fleet with 80 warships and its headquarters from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk base in 2020.

The Russian lease on port facilities in Sevastopol, which, though the main base of Russia&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet, was part of Ukraine, was set to expire in 2017. Ukraine was reported to be planning not to renew the lease; however, in April 2010 the Russian and Ukrainian presidents signed an agreement to extend the lease by twenty-five years, with an option of further extension of five years after the new term expires. However, in 2014, Crimea was occupied by the Russian Armed Forces during the 2014 Crimean crisis and as such the question of renewing the lease does not immediately arise while Crimea remains illegally occupied by the Russian Federation according to international law (See: Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation).

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with twenty-four rural localities, incorporated as the City of Novorossiysk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Novorossiysk is incorporated as Novorossiysk Urban Okrug.

=== Coat of arms of Novorossiysk ===
The coat of arms of Novorossiysk was officially approved by Emperor Nicholas II on October 15, 1914. The description of the coat of arms was as follows: in a golden field above a black wavy tip, a black double-headed eagle under a crown, in the paws of an eagle a scepter and a power, on the chest a scarlet shield in which a golden Orthodox cross above a silver inverted crescent. In 1994, the Soviet coat of arms was changed to a new one. In 2006, the coat of arms of 1914 was re-adopted with minor changes (a crown was added). The description of the modern coat of arms sounds like this in official sources: In a gold shield with a black wavy tip is a black double-headed eagle crowned with an Imperial crown, with a scepter and a power in its paws, on the wings of which is a shield, in the scarlet field of which is a golden Orthodox eight-pointed cross mounted on a silver inverted crescent. The shield is crowned with a golden five-pronged tower crown.
==Geography==

The city is located on the Black Sea. It is not a resort town, but Anapa to the north and Gelendzhik to the south are. There are several urban settlements under the jurisdiction of Novorossiysk. The most famous is Abrau-Dyurso, which consists of a townlet on the shore of Lake Abrau and a village on the coast of the Black Sea, connected by a winding mountain road.

The area of Novorossiysk is one of Russia&#x27;s main wine-growing regions. The wineries of Abrau-Dyurso, established by Tsar Alexander III in 1870, produce table and sparkling wines for domestic consumption.

===Climate===
Novorossiysk has a borderline humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) in the Köppen climate classification. Since the driest month has and may or may not happen consistently in the summer, the city cannot be classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean.
== Economy ==
The city sprawls along the shore of the non-freezing Tsemess Bay, which has been recognized since antiquity as one of the superior bays of the Black Sea. The Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port–with the market capitalization of $1,110,000,000 and shares listed at Moscow Exchange and London Stock Exchange–serves Russian sea trade with regions of Asia, Middle East, Africa, Mediterranean, and South America. It is the busiest oil port in the Black Sea and the terminus of the pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan, developed by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium.

Novorossiysk is also an industrial city, dependent on steel, food processing, and the production of metal goods and other manufactures.

<text>In accounting, a deferral is any account where the income or expense is not recognised until a future date.

In accounting, deferral refers to the recognition of revenue or expenses at a later time than when the cash transaction occurs. This concept is used to align the reporting of financial transactions with the periods in which they are earned or incurred, according to the matching principle and revenue recognition principle. Deferrals are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet until they are recognized in the appropriate accounting period.

Two common types of deferrals are [[deferred expense]]s and [[deferred income]]. A deferred expense represents cash paid in advance for goods or services that will be consumed in future periods. On the other hand, deferred income (or deferred revenue) is a liability that arises when payment is received for goods or services that have yet to be delivered or fulfilled.

==Deferred charge==
A deferred charge is a cost recorded in a later accounting period for its expected future benefit, or to comply with the matching principle, which matches costs with revenue. Deferred charges include costs such as those related to startup activities, obtaining long-term debt, or running major advertising campaigns. These are carried as non-current assets on the balance sheet until they are amortized.

Deferred charges typically extend over five years or more and occur less frequently than prepaid expenses, such as insurance, interest, or rent. Financial ratios often exclude deferred charges from total assets because they lack physical substance (i.e., they do not generate cash directly) and cannot be used to reduce total liabilities.

==Deferred expense==
A deferred expense, also known as a prepayment or prepaid expense, is an asset representing cash paid in advance for goods or services to be received in a future accounting period. For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, the remaining two months at the end of the first month are considered a deferred expense. The prepaid amount is then recognized as an expense in subsequent accounting periods, with the corresponding amount deducted from the prepayment.

A deferred expense is similar to accrued revenue, where proceeds from goods or services delivered are recognized as revenue in the period earned, while the cash for them is received later.

For example, if insurance is paid annually, 11/12 of the cost would be recorded as a &quot;prepaid expense&quot;, decreasing by 1/12 each month as the expense is recognized. This prevents overstatement of expenses in the period of payment and avoids understating them in subsequent periods.

Similarly, cash paid for goods or services not received by the end of the accounting period is added to &quot;prepayments&quot; to prevent overstating expenses in the payment period. These costs are recognized in the income statement (P&amp;L) in the period the goods or services are received and deducted from &quot;prepayments&quot; on the balance sheet.

==Deferred revenue==
Deferred revenue (or deferred income) is a liability representing cash received for goods or services that will be delivered in a future accounting period. Once the income is earned, the corresponding revenue is recognized, and the &quot;deferred revenue&quot; liability is reduced. Unlike &quot;accrued expenses&quot;, where a liability is an obligation to pay for received goods or services, deferred revenue reflects an obligation to deliver goods or services for which payment has already been received.

For example, if a company receives an annual software license fee upfront on January 1 but its fiscal year ends on May 31, the company using accrual accounting would only recognize five months&#x27; worth (5/12) of the fee as revenue in the current fiscal year&#x27;s profit and loss statement. The remaining amount is recorded as &quot;deferred income&quot; (a liability) on the balance sheet for that year.

<doc id="1190361" wikidata="Q4603571" url="?curid=1190361" title="2003–2005 African locust outbreak">
<text>In 2004, West and North Africa experienced their largest infestation of desert locusts in more than 15 years. A number of countries in the fertile northern regions of Africa were affected.

==Development==
The increase in Desert Locust breeding activity was noted in the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Desert Locust Bulletins in the autumn of 2003 when four unrelated outbreaks occurred simultaneously in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Sudan. Shortly thereafter, unusually heavy rain fell for two days over a large area that extended from Dakar, Senegal to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Some areas in Western Sahara received more than 100 mm of rain whereas they normally receive about 1 mm of rain in a year. Consequently, ecological conditions remained favourable for at least six months and allowed several successive generations of Desert Locust breeding. In such circumstances, locusts increased very rapidly. By early 2004, the threat materialized as swarms of locusts started to form and move north into important agricultural areas in Morocco and Algeria, inflicting damage to crops. The collective fear, expressed by the FAO and news organizations covering the situation, was the potential destruction of a sizable portion of Africa&#x27;s food supply if control operations could not be mounted quickly and successfully.

During the summer of 2004, large numbers of swarms from Northwest Africa invaded the Sahel in West Africa and quickly moved into crops. By then, the threat of a locust plague emerged, creating one of the most dangerous locust situations since 1989. As the year progressed, the swarms migrated over the continent causing devastation, and in November 2004 appeared in northern Egypt, Jordan and Israel for the first time in 50 years. One swarm in Morocco between Tarfaya and Tan-Tan was 230 km long, at least 150 m wide, and contained an estimated 69 billion locusts, which were being used as a food resource by 33 species of birds (Ullman 2006). Swarms also invaded Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, southern Portugal, and Crete. Lack of rain and cold temperatures in the winter breeding area of Northwest Africa slowed down the development of the locusts and allowed the locust control agencies to stop the cycle in early 2005.

National teams in some 20 countries treated nearly 130,000 square kilometres by air and ground. The costs of fighting this upsurge have been estimated by the FAO to have exceeded US$400 million and harvest losses were valued at up to US$2.5 billion which had disastrous effects on the food security situation in West Africa. However a combination of strict pest control measures and a good harvest allowed Africa to avoid a continent-wide food disaster. According to the FAO, while the overall food output for the affected Sahel region has declined, it is still within the range of five-year averages. Nevertheless, some countries lost significant portions of their crops to the locusts, particularly Mauritania, which lost as much as half of its harvest.

The outbreak inspired several works of literature. In March 2007, Andersen Press published &quot;Sophie and the Locust Curse&quot;, a novel by British children&#x27;s author Stephen Davies about the devastating impact of the 2004 locust swarm on communities in the Sahel region of Burkina Faso.

<doc id="1190366" wikidata="Q334385" url="?curid=1190366" title="Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury">
<text>Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury (6 March 1887 – 30 January 1971) was a British Conservative politician. He served as a government minister between 1931 and 1941 and served as Governor-General of Ceylon between the years 1949 and 1954.

==Background==
Ramsbotham was the son of Herwald Ramsbotham, of Crowborough Warren, Crowborough, East Sussex, JP for Sussex (son of James Ramsbotham, of Todmorden, Lancashire, JP, and wife Jane Fielden), and Ethel Margaret Bevan.

He went to Uppingham School, Uppingham, Rutland, England.

==Military career==
Ramsbotham was commissioned a Temporary Lieutenant in 1915 and was promoted to temporary Captain later the same year. He was promoted to temporary Major by 1918 and received the Military Cross. He was appointed an OBE in 1919 and relinquished his commission that year.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Ramsbotham was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Lancaster in 1929. In 1931 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education by Ramsay MacDonald, a post he retained when Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister in June 1935, and then served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries between November 1935 and July 1936. In September 1936 he was made Minister of Pensions by Baldwin. He continued in this office when Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister in May 1937. In June 1939 he was appointed First Commissioner of Works and sworn of the Privy Council.

===President of the Board of Education===
Ramsbotham entered the Cabinet (but not the small inner War Cabinet) in April 1940 as President of the Board of Education. He remained in this office after Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940. In June 1940 Cardinal Arthur Hinsley, leader of the English Catholic Church, led a deputation to Ramsbotham to demand financial support for Catholic schools. Ramsbotham acknowledged that in principle the Catholic schools needed help but made no firm commitment, and stressed that greater state control over their schools, which the Catholic hierarchy did not want, would be the &quot;quid pro quo&quot;.

Ramsbotham spoke to the Lancashire NUT in Morecambe (reported in &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 March 1941). He wanted the school leaving age raised from 14 to 15, and thereafter to 16, as soon as possible, and day continuation classes up to the age of 18 (classes of this kind had been proposed in the 1918 Fisher Act and in subsequent reform proposals, but had not been implemented due to cost constraints - the same was true of the raising of the leaving age). All depended on how quickly schools could be repaired (both from war damage, and the previous poor state of many church schools), which would mean competing with housing for building priorities.

Ramsbotham&#x27;s department produced a set of proposals for reform, called “The Green Book” after its cover, in June 1941. The Green Book was supposedly confidential but was widely distributed among opinion formers, as Lester Smith put it, “in a blaze of secrecy”, and was later used as the basis for talks with Local Education Authorities (LEAs) and teaching unions. Paragraph 137 proposed compensating for greater state control of &quot;church&quot; schools by partially lifting the 1870 Forster Act&#x27;s ban on denominational instruction in &quot;state&quot; schools, to allow such teaching from the age of 11. Paradoxically this was not good enough for the churches, as the proposal for separate state schools from the age of 11 would &quot;reduce&quot; their control over children aged 11–14, who up until that time had been educated in church schools. R. A. Butler later wrote in his memoirs that the Green Book failed on the issue of denominational teaching in state schools. The Roman Catholic hierarchy rejected the Green Book out of hand. The Green Book was soon overshadowed by the Five Points, the Protestant Churches&#x27; proposals on Religious Education in state schools which had been issued in February.

Although many of Ramsbotham&#x27;s proposals would later be incorporated into Butler&#x27;s 1944 Act, Churchill nursed memories of the controversy over the 1902 Act and did not favour major education reform at this stage. He used the March speech as an excuse to remove him – he was succeeded by Butler in July 1941 and sent to the House of Lords as a viscount.

===Peerage===
In August Ramsbotham was raised to the peerage as Baron Soulbury, of Soulbury in the County of Buckingham, and made Chairman of the Assistance Board, a post he held until 1948. Chairman of the Soulbury Commission 1944–45. Between 1949 and 1954 he served as Governor-General of Ceylon. He was appointed a GCMG in 1949 and a GCVO on 20 April 1954. On 10 June of that year, he was further honoured when he was created Viscount Soulbury, of Soulbury in the County of Buckingham.

==Family==
Lord Soulbury died in January 1971 at the age of 83.

He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his elder son James Ramsbotham, 2nd Viscount Soulbury. His younger son, Sir Peter Ramsbotham, notably served as British Ambassador to the United States from 1974 to 1977.

<doc id="1190369" wikidata="Q1672472" url="?curid=1190369" title="Irazú Volcano">
<text>The Irazú Volcano () is an active volcano in Costa Rica, situated in the Cordillera Central close to the city of Cartago.

The name might have come from either the combination of &quot;ara&quot; (point) and &quot;tzu&quot; (thunder) or a corruption of &quot;Iztarú&quot;, which was the name of an indigenous village on the flanks of the volcano. In Costa Rica it is known by the name of &quot;El Coloso&quot; (the Colossus) due to the catastrophes that it has unleashed in the past.

The volcano&#x27;s summit has several craters, one of which contains Diego de la Haya, a green crater lake of variable depth. At 11,260 feet (3,432 m), the Irazú Volcano is the highest active volcano in Costa Rica. It is thus a popular tourist spot. It is easily visited from San José, the Costa Rican capital, with a road leading right up to the summit craters and a weekly bus service to the top. The summit of the volcano also houses a few television transmitters for television stations in San José.

From the top it is possible to see both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on a clear day. However, such clear days are rare, and the volcano&#x27;s summit is usually cloud-covered.

The volcano is contained within the Irazú Volcano National Park, which spreads across 5,705 acres (2,300 ha). The national park contains both primary and secondary montane forests and is home to armadillos, owls, rabbits, foxes, woodpeckers, and hummingbirds.

== Geology ==
The Irazú volcano is a complex volcanic shield. It is the highest active volcano in Costa Rica, and has an area of . It has an irregular subconic shape, and temperatures at its summit vary between , with a record low of −3 °C(26.6 °F) and a record high of 23.2 °C(73.4 °F). Irazu volcano is a stratovolcano with a summit elevation of . Its five craters are easily differentiated. The most important ones, because of their activity, are The Main Crater and the Diego de la Haya crater. The Main Crater is almost circular, has very inclined walls and it measures in diameter and deep. The Diego de la Haya crater is in diameter and deep. Other craters are Playa Hermosa, La Laguna, and El Piroclastico.

Irazú is the southernmost of the ten Quaternary volcanoes which form a northwest-trending line through central and northern Costa Rica. Radioactive dating has shown an age of at least 854,000 years with eruption peaks at 570,000 years and the most recent active phase from 136,000 years to present. The most recent activity includes lava flows along with strombolian and phreatomagmatic explosions. Lava types include basalt and andesite erupted during different events suggesting the volcano is fed by two distinct magma chambers. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica&#x27;s Irazu volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months. Study authors called it the highway from hell.

==Eruptive history==
Irazú has erupted frequently in historical times — at least 23 times since its first historically recorded eruption in 1723. Its most famous eruption began in mid-March 1963, a few days before US President John F. Kennedy started a state visit to Costa Rica. It showered the capital San José and much of the central highlands of Costa Rica with ash. Eruptions continued for two years.

Its historical eruptions generally have VEIs of 1 to 3. All historical eruptions have been explosive, and there have been many phreatic eruptions, and some have produced pyroclastic flows. The latest eruption lasted only 1 day, and occurred on December 8, 1994. It occurred at a flank vent and was a phreatic eruption, which produced lahars.

<doc id="1190370" wikidata="Q7732531" url="?curid=1190370" title="The Establishment (club)">
<text>The Establishment was a London nightclub that opened in October 1961, at 18 Greek Street, Soho, and which became known in retrospect for satire although at the time was a venue more commonly booking jazz acts and used for other events. It was founded by Peter Cook and Nicholas Luard, both of whom were also important in the history of the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The name &quot;The Establishment&quot; is a play on the meaning of &quot;establishment&quot; as in &quot;institution,&quot; i.e. the club itself, and the broader definition meaning the prevailing social order of the time, which the satirists who founded, funded and performed at the club typically undermined. A pun is suggested as, to be a member of this club, was to literally but not figuratively be a &quot;member of the establishment&quot;. Peter Cook called it &quot;the only good title I ever came up with.&quot;

The venue allowed the opportunity for budding comedians and satirists to perform new material in a nightclub setting, outside the jurisdiction of the Lord Chamberlain, whose censorship of language and content was a problem for many performers. Some who appeared included Lenny Bruce in 1962 (subsequently banned from entering the UK a year later), Barry Humphries (as Edna Everage), and musically, The Dudley Moore Trio. &quot;The Establishment&quot;, a tie-in album of comedy routines and sketches featuring John Bird, John Fortune, Eleanor Bron and Jeremy Geidt, was released on the Parlophone label in 1963.

A second club was established in New York City in 1963. However, both folded after only a few years. The Establishment in London closed in 1964.

==Legacy==

In March 2008, the site of the club was renamed Zebrano&#x27;s but after a small group of Peter Cook devotees, Sally Western, Jonathan Hansler and Robert Ross, pressured the management for some recognition of the old club&#x27;s importance in satire, the owners agreed to place &quot;The Establishment&quot; in writing above the door. A green plaque was also positioned above the door by Westminster City Council after campaigning by the same group.

The Establishment was referenced in the book &quot;Stop-Time&quot; by author Frank Conroy. The book is a semi-autobiographical account of Conroy&#x27;s own life, and he mentions getting drunk at The Establishment, and then racing his car home to his apartment outside London while he was living in England with his wife in the &#x27;60s. The Establishment also featured briefly in the semi-fictional Peter Cook and Dudley Moore biopic &quot;Not Only But Always&quot; (2004); seen only in an exterior shot, it bore no resemblance to 18 Greek Street.

The location of the original venue currently operates as a bar as of July 2024.

<doc id="1190374" wikidata="Q1132434" url="?curid=1190374" title="The Searchers (band)">
<text>The Searchers are an English Merseybeat group who flourished during the British Invasion of the 1960s. The band&#x27;s hits include a remake of the Drifters&#x27; 1961 hit, &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot;; &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; (written by their producer Tony Hatch); remakes of Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;; a cover of the Orlons&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Your Love Away&quot;; and a cover of the Clovers&#x27; &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot;. With the Swinging Blue Jeans, the Searchers tied for being the second group from Liverpool, after the Beatles, to have a hit in the US when their &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and the Swinging Blue Jeans&#x27; &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake&quot; both reached the Hot 100 on 7 March 1964.

==Band history==
===Origins===
Founded as a skiffle group in Liverpool in 1959 by John McNally and Mike Pender, the band took their name from the 1956 John Ford western film &quot;The Searchers&quot;.

The band grew out of an earlier skiffle group called The Army Generations formed by McNally in 1955, with his friends Ron Woodbridge (born 1938 in Liverpool; lead vocals, guitar) and Tony West (born 1938 in Liverpool, died 11 November 2010 in Hightown, Merseyside; bass). In March 1957, McNally was joined by his guitarist neighbour Brian Dolan and the name change The Army Generations also agreed to change the name to The Searchers since April 1957. When the other two members lost interest, McNally was joined by his guitarist neighbour Mike Prendergast. They soon recruited Tony Jackson with his homemade bass guitar and amplifier, who was recruited as a lead singer, but took a back seat at first in order to learn the bass. The band styled themselves as &quot;Tony and the Searchers&quot; with Joe Kennedy (born 1941 in Liverpool, died 21 November 2023) on drums.

===1960s and 1970s===

McGarry was forced to quit the band when he was put on the nightshift at the bakery where he worked and in 1960 his place was taken by Chris Crummey (26 August 1941 – 28 February 2005), who later changed his name to Chris Curtis. Billy Beck, who changed his name to Johnny Sandon, became the lead singer. The band had regular bookings at Liverpool&#x27;s Iron Door Club as &quot;Johnny Sandon and The Searchers&quot;.

Sandon left the band in late 1961 to join The Remo Four in February 1962. The group settled into a quartet named &quot;The Searchers&quot;, with Jackson becoming the main vocalist. They continued to play at the Iron Door, The Cavern, and other Liverpool clubs. Like many similar acts they would do as many as three shows at different venues in one night. They negotiated a contract with the Star-Club in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg for 128 days, with three one-hour performances a night, starting in July 1962.

The band returned to a residency at the Iron Door Club and it was there that they tape-recorded the sessions that led to a Pye Records recording contract with Tony Hatch as producer. The first single, &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot;, featuring Tony Jackson as main vocalist supported by Pender and Curtis, shot to number one in the UK in 1963, firmly establishing the band as a major spearhead of the &quot;Merseybeat&quot; boom, just behind The Beatles and alongside Gerry and the Pacemakers. Their first album, &quot;Meet The Searchers&quot;, sung mostly by Jackson and Pender, was released in August 1963 and reached number 2 on the British album charts the next month. With a slightly changed track listing, including the song &quot;Needles and Pins&quot;, it hit #22 in the US album charts in June 1964.

In the US their first single was issued on Mercury and the second on Liberty, both without success; then a deal was arranged with US-based Kapp Records to distribute their records in America.

Philips Records then released an earlier recording they held of a cover of Brenda Lee&#x27;s hit &#x27;Sweet Nuthins&#x27;, which dismayed the group. It made the lower end of the UK chart, but did not disturb their momentum.

In the 1964 film &quot;Saturday Night Out&quot; the group played the title song of the soundtrack.

Hatch played piano on some recordings and wrote &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;, the band&#x27;s UK #2 hit record, under the pseudonym Fred Nightingale, a secret he kept from the band at the time. Apparently Curtis disliked this song (largely a revamp of the key aspects of first hits) and refused to sing on it. Jackson again took lead vocal, though Curtis later agreed to sing the distinctive high-harmony vocal links between verses. &quot;Love Potion No.9&quot;, sung by Jackson, was a non-UK single lifted from the first LP that was a hit in the US on Kapp Records in 1965.

Mike Pender took the main lead vocal on the next two singles, both of which topped the UK charts: &quot;Needles And Pins&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Throw Your Love Away&quot;, each featuring Chris Curtis on co-lead/high-harmony vocal. However, live footage of these songs, as performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and NME Poll Winners concert respectively, show Pender and Jackson singing the lead vocal together in close harmony, with vocal support from Curtis. 

After scoring with their hit &quot;Needles And Pins&quot;, bassist Tony Jackson, who was only allowed one co-lead vocal on their third album (on &quot;Sho Know A Lot About Love&quot;), left the band and was replaced by a Searchers&#x27; Hamburg pal, Frank Allen from Cliff Bennett and The Rebel Rousers. Jackson was then signed to Pye as a solo act and, backed by The Vibrations, issued a few singles of which the first, &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, charted in the UK in 1964. He also re-cut &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot; but it failed to chart. The next Searchers single to chart in the UK during this period was &quot;Some Day We&#x27;re Gonna Love Again&quot; (1964).

Frank Allen&#x27;s debut single with the band, a cover of Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot;, shot to #3 in the UK, and later UK chart hits followed with &quot;What Have They Done to the Rain&quot;, &quot;Goodbye My Love&quot; (which reached #4), then the folk-flavoured &quot;Take Me For What I&#x27;m Worth&quot; (written by P.F. Sloan). Some lesser UK chart hits followed in 1965 and 1966, with &quot;He&#x27;s Got No Love&quot;, &quot;When I Get Home&quot;, and finally &quot;Have You Ever Loved Somebody&quot;. An EP release, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Kiss Ya&quot;, featuring The Searchers&#x27; first LP track, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Kiss Ya&quot; (sung by Jackson), also charted in 1963.

Pye&#x27;s &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; LP was quickly issued in 1963, consisting of tracks not used on the first album and others, plus the second single. This album charted while the first was still in the charts. Further Pye albums were &quot;It&#x27;s the Searchers&quot; (1964), &quot;Sounds Like Searchers&quot; and finally &quot;Take Me for What I&#x27;m Worth&quot; (both 1965). A budget &quot;Golden Guinea&quot; reissue of the second album, plus a compilation &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Smash Hits Vol 2&quot;, on Pye&#x27;s budget &quot;Marble Arch&quot; label, were issued during 1966 and 1967 in place of any later album of new material. As late as 1970, Marble Arch issued an edited version of &quot;It&#x27;s the Searchers&quot;, the group&#x27;s third album, originally released in 1964.

Chris Curtis&#x27;s choice of Bobby Darin&#x27;s &quot;When I Get Home&quot; was a relative chart failure by the band&#x27;s standards. This to an extent undermined Curtis&#x27;s position as song selector for the band, and some internal disagreements resurfaced over musical policy and direction that had been evident earlier when Tony Jackson had left, and likely played a part in Curtis leaving as well. This departure was a major blow, as Curtis had been chief songwriter, song selector, and key high harmony voice, as well as a figurehead member and the main PR man. Curtis left the band in April 1966 and was replaced by the Keith Moon-influenced John Blunt. In January 1970 he was replaced by Billy Adamson. After Curtis&#x27; departure Frank Allen handled the high harmonies. In 1967, Curtis formed a new band called Roundabout with keyboard player Jon Lord and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Curtis&#x27;s involvement in the project was short-lived; Roundabout evolved into Deep Purple the following year.

As musical styles evolved, The Searchers did attempt to move with the times, recording covers of songs by The Rolling Stones (&quot;Take It Or Leave it&quot;) and The Hollies &quot;Have You Ever Loved Somebody&quot;, which was a minor UK chart hit though a rival cover by Paul &amp; Barry Ryan probably robbed both parties of a bigger hit. They began to write their singles&#x27; A-sides, first with the Curtis-Pender track &quot;He&#x27;s Got No Love&quot;, which had a Stones-style guitar hook, and later a Pender-Allen song, &quot;Secondhand Dealer&quot;, the final Pye single, which was a Ray Davies-style &quot;observational&quot; song. However, Pye records dropped the group in 1967 when their original contract expired. No further chart successes occurred.

The band continued to record for Liberty Records and RCA Records, and worked on the British &quot;Chicken-in-a-Basket&quot; touring circuit. They had a minor US hit in 1971 with &quot;Desdemona&quot;. A contract with RCA Victor&#x27;s UK wing resulted in an album of rerecorded hits titled &quot;Second Take&quot; (1972), later reissued on the budget RCA International label as &quot;Needles &amp; Pins&quot;. However, that was overshadowed by Pye&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hour of...&quot; compilation of the original hits that came out at the same time. Despite recording new material, including covers of Neil Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Solitaire&quot; and the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Spicks And Specks&quot;, which were issued as RCA singles with scant promotion, much of their new work was not issued at the time, and RCA later dropped the group.

The group continued to tour through the 1970s, playing both the expected old hits as well as contemporary songs such as an extended live version of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Southern Man&quot;. They were rewarded in 1979 when Sire Records signed them to a multi-record deal. Two albums were released: &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;Play for Today&quot; (retitled &quot;Love&#x27;s Melodies&quot; outside the UK). Both records garnered critical acclaim and featured some original tracks, as well as covers of songs such as Alex Chilton&#x27;s &quot;September Gurls&quot; and John Fogerty&#x27;s &quot;Almost Saturday Night&quot;. But with scant promotion and little if any radio airplay, they did not break into the charts. The first album was quickly revamped following release with a few extra tracks added, one song dropped (a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Coming From The Heart&quot;), and a new sleeve.

The albums did, however, revive the group&#x27;s career, because concerts from then on alternated classic hits with the newer songs that were well received. A Sire single, &quot;Hearts in Her Eyes&quot;, written by Will Birch and John Wicks of The Records, and successfully updating their distinctive 12-string guitars/vocal harmonies sound, picked up some radio airplay. Meanwhile, PRT Records actively promoted the group&#x27;s sixties back catalogue, with compilations such as &quot;The Searchers File&quot; and &quot;Spotlight on the Searchers&quot;, which were on sale at group gigs, along with the Sire albums, and helped re-establish them.

According to John McNally, the band was ready to head into the studio to record a third album for Sire when they were informed that, due to label reorganisation, their contract had been dropped.

===1980s – present===
In 1981, the band signed to PRT Records (formerly Pye, their original label) and began recording an album. But only one single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Be The One&quot; backed with &quot;Hollywood&quot;, ended up being released. They promoted this with a UK Television appearance on &quot;The Leo Sayer Show&quot;, which was rare for them by then, but the single got little if any radio airplay (like their Sire singles) and was not stocked by most record shops. The rest of the tracks, except one, would be included as part of 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers 30th Anniversary Collection 1962-1992&quot;.

After a farewell performance in London in December 1985 Mike Pender left the group to form a new band and now tours as Mike Pender&#x27;s Searchers (originally a permanent band but now made up of musicians hired as necessary), performing Searchers&#x27; songs and some new material of his own. McNally and Allen, following Pender&#x27;s departure, recruited former First Class vocalist Spencer James as his replacement.

In 1988, Coconut Records signed the Searchers and the album &quot;Hungry Hearts&quot; was the result. It featured updated remakes of &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; and &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot; plus live favorite &quot;Somebody Told Me You Were Crying&quot;. While the album was not a major hit, it did keep the group in the public eye.

The band continued to tour, with Eddie Rothe replacing Adamson on drums, and during that period was considered to be one of the most popular 1960s bands on the UK concert circuit. In turn, in 2010 Eddie Rothe left The Searchers after becoming engaged to singer Jane McDonald, and was replaced on 26 February by Scott Ottaway. Rothe died on 26 March 2021 aged 67.

The original bassist for the Searchers, Tony West (born 1938 in Liverpool), died in his sleep on 11 November 2010, aged 72 in Hightown, Merseyside.

Billy Adamson, the band&#x27;s drummer from 1970 to 1998, died in France on 11 November 2013, aged 69.

In September 2017, John McNally had a stroke and stood aside from the band for two months to recover.

In 2018, The Searchers announced that the band would be retiring, and they ended their farewell tour on 31 March 2019. They did not rule out the possibility of a reunion tour, and it was announced on the band&#x27;s website in 2021 that they would undertake a further farewell tour in 2023, this time with drummer Richard Burns.

In August 2023, Frank Allen announced that the band were to be doing yet another farewell tour in 2024.

The original drummer for the Searchers, Joe Kennedy, later served in the United States Navy. He died on 21 November 2023, aged 81. 

Drummer John Blunt died on 13 March 2024.

In 2025 the band announced a UK tour for June.

<text>Money is an American brand and a personal finance website owned by Money Group. From its 1972 founding until 2018, it was a monthly magazine published by Time Inc. and subsequently by Meredith Corporation from 2018 to 2019. Its articles cover the gamut of personal finance topics ranging from credit cards, mortgages, insurance, banking, and investing to family finance issues, including paying for college, credit, career, and home improvement. It also publishes an annual list of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Places to Live&quot;.

==History==
The first issue of &quot;Money&quot; magazine was published in October 1972 by Time Inc. The magazine, along with &quot;Fortune&quot;, partnered with sister cable network CNN in CNNMoney.com after the discontinuation of the CNNfn business news channel in 2005. In 2014, after Time Inc.&#x27;s spin-off from its parent company Time Warner, which also owned CNN, Money launched its website, Money.com.

After Meredith Corporation acquired Time Inc. at the beginning of 2018, &quot;Money&quot; was put up for sale. In April 2019, Meredith announced the discontinuation of Money&#x27;s print publication, focusing instead on its digital platform, Money.com. The last print issue was published in June 2019.

In October 2019, Meredith Corporation sold the &quot;Money&quot; brand and website to Money Group, formerly known as Ad Practitioners LLC, a Puerto Rico-based media and advertising company which operates ConsumersAdvocate.org. In 2023, Money added &quot;Best Cars&quot; and &quot;Best Hospitals&quot; to their roster of flagships, joining their existing &quot;Best Places to Live&quot;, &quot;Best Places to Travel&quot;, &quot;Best Colleges&quot;, and &quot;Best Banks&quot; annual franchises.

== Products and services ==
Money&#x27;s website includes financial news coverage, informational content on credit, loans, insurance, investing, and personal finance, and individual and comparative product and service reviews of companies across those industries. Money employs an editorial team of financial experts, reporters, journalists, and writers with offices in Puerto Rico and New York.

<doc id="1190376" wikidata="Q338192" url="?curid=1190376" title="Acatenango">
<text>Acatenango is a stratovolcano in Guatemala, close to the city of Antigua. It is part of the mountain range of the Sierra Madre. The volcano has two peaks, &quot;Pico Mayor&quot; (Highest Peak) and &quot;Yepocapa&quot; (3,880 m) which is also known as Tres Hermanas (Three Sisters). Acatenango is joined with Volcán de Fuego and collectively the volcano complex is known as La Horqueta.

==Description==
The Fuego-Acatenango massif comprises a string of five or more volcanic vents along a north–south trend that is perpendicular to that of the Central American Volcanic Arc in Guatemala. From north to south, known centres of volcanism are Ancient Acatenango, Yepocapa, Pico Mayor de Acatenango, Meseta, and Fuego. Volcanism along the trend stretches back more than 200,000 years. Although many of the centres have been active contemporaneously, there is a general sequence of younger volcanism, from north to south along the trend.

This massive volcano complex towers more than 3,500 metres above the Pacific coastal plain to the south and 2,000 metres above the Guatemalan Highlands to the north. The volcano complex comprises remnants of multiple eruptive centres, which periodically have collapsed to form huge debris avalanches. The largest of these avalanches extended more than 50 kilometres from its source and covered more than 300 square kilometres.

== Eruption history ==
The only known historical eruptions of Acatenango volcano occurred in the 20th century, between 1924 and 1927 from just north of the summit peak (Pico Mayor) and again in December 1972 from the saddle between Yepocapa and Pico Mayor. These phreatic explosions generated ballistic volcanic bombs that fell near the summit craters and fine volcanic ash that fell up to 25 km away.

In prehistoric time, Acatenango has erupted explosively to form widespread fall deposits, hot pyroclastic flows and lava flows. There have been numerous eruptions during the past 80,000 years from vents along the massif. The most recent explosive eruptions of Acatenango occurred 1,900 years ago (Pico Mayor), 2,300 years ago (Pico Mayor) and about 5,000 years ago (Yepocapa). If such eruptions were to recur, many people and costly infrastructure would be at risk.
==Economy ==
The Acatenango Valley is a designated coffee-producing region of Anacafé.

<text>Volcán de Agua (also known as Junajpú by Maya) is an extinct stratovolcano located in the departments of Sacatepéquez and Escuintla in Guatemala. At , Agua Volcano towers more than above the Pacific coastal plain to the south and above the Guatemalan Highlands to the north. It dominates the local landscape except when hidden by cloud cover. The volcano is within of the city of Antigua Guatemala and several other large towns situated on its northern apron. These towns have a combined population of nearly 100,000. It is within about of Escuintla (population, ) to the south. Coffee is grown on the volcano&#x27;s lower slopes.

==Brief description and history==

The local Kaqchikel people have always called the volcano Hunapú &quot;place of flowers&quot; or Jun Ajpu&#x27; &quot;one hunter&quot; (The calendar date for the sacred site; a typical method for naming sacred sites in Mayan cosmovision) in current Kaqchikel orthography. The Spanish conquistadors also called it Hunapú until a lahar from the volcano on September 10, 1541 destroyed the original capital of Guatemala (now known as Ciudad Vieja) and the city was moved to Antigua Guatemala following this disaster. Among the casualties was the governor Beatriz de la Cueva. As the lahar produced a destructive flood of water, this prompted the modern name &quot;Volcán de Agua&quot; meaning &quot;Volcano of Water&quot;, in contrast to the nearby &quot;Volcán de Fuego&quot; or &quot;Volcano of Fire&quot;. The Kaqchikels call Volcán de Fuego &quot;Chi Gag&quot;, which translates to &quot;where the fire is&quot; or Chi Q&#x27;aq&#x27; in current Kaqchikel orthography.

The volcano was active in the late Pleistocene between 80,000 and 10,000 years ago, but has not erupted since then. Despite the lack of eruptive activity, the volcano can still produce debris flows and lahars that inundate nearby populated areas. This was proven by the fact that on 11 September 1541, newly founded villa of Santiago de los Caballeros was ruined by a &quot;formidable landslide that came down Volcán de Agua; the mudslide brought along heavy rocks that destroyed part of the buildings and damaged the rest&quot;. The city was destroyed and the survivors had no direction, since governor Beatriz de la Cueva died during the disaster, which took place shortly after her husband, Adelantado Pedro de Alvarado, died and she was appointed governor by the Ayuntamiento (English:City Hall). Beatriz de la Cueva had been beside herself with grief and on 9 September 1541, when she had signed the Cabildo documents, she did so as &quot;la sin ventura&quot; (English: the unlucky one), a phrase that turned out to be prophetic. In the aftermath Beatriz de la Cueva was blamed for the disaster as it was considered to be a godly punishment for her sins. Additionally her fate became a cautionary tale about giving women positions in government particularly when many qualified men were available.

In 1895 Anne Cary Maudslay and her husband, archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay visited the Antigua Guatemala region as part of a journey through Guatemala&#x27;s Maya and colonial archeological monuments, and climbed the Volcán de Agua; she wrote a book called &quot;A Glimpse at Guatemala&quot; where she explains that water from the volcano crater could not have destroyed the old Santiago: The cause of this catastrophe is usually said to have been the bursting of the side of a lake which had been formed in the crater of the extinct Volcán de Agua; but an examination of the crater shows this explanation to be improbable, as the break in the crater-wall is in an opposite direction, and no water flowing from it could have reached the town. Moreover, there is no evidence to show that the deeper portion of the crater, which is still intact, has held water since the reported outbreak. Indeed, an accumulation of water during the exceptionally heavy rain, through some temporary obstruction in one of the deep worn gullies which indent the beautiful slope of that great mountain, and a subsequent landslip would probably account for the damage done without the aid of either an eruption of water from the crater or the supernatural appearances which are duly noted by the old chroniclers.The volcano was last blanketed by snowfall in January 1967.

The Volcán de Agua has been declared a protected area in 1956 and covers an area of .

On 21 January 2012, 12,000 Guatemalans formed a human chain all the way to the peak of Volcán de Agua in a protest against domestic violence.

<doc id="1190378" wikidata="Q7528499" url="?curid=1190378" title="Philip Sassoon">
<text>Sir Philip Albert Gustave David Sassoon, 3rd Baronet (4 December 1888 – 3 June 1939) was a British politician and aristocrat. He served as a staff officer during the First World War, from July 1914 to November 1918.

==Family==
Sassoon was a member of the prominent Jewish Sassoon family and Rothschild family. He was born in his mother&#x27;s mansion on Avenue de Marigny, Paris. His father was Sir Edward Albert Sassoon, 2nd Baronet, MP, son of Albert Abdullah David Sassoon; his mother was Aline Caroline, daughter of Gustave Samuel de Rothschild. His sister was Sybil Sassoon, who married the Marquess of Cholmondeley. He was a cousin of the war poet Siegfried Sassoon. He was descended from the banking family of Frankfurt. When aged only nineteen years old his great-grandfather, James Rothschild was sent to Paris to set up the family business in France. James became wealthy. When he died in 1868 he was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. His branch of the Sassoon-Rothschild family kept the Jewish faith, donated to Jewish charities and founded synagogues.

His great-grandfather David Sassoon had been imprisoned in Baghdad in 1828, and in 1832 he established his business David Sassoon &amp; Co. at Bombay. He took advantage of British rule to return to Baghdad to trade. The family eventually established a Head Office at 12, Leadenhall Street, London and a company branch in Manchester. The Sassoons became assimilated Jews, dressing, acting and thinking like Englishmen. The Sassoon Brothers, David and Albert were friends of the Prince of Wales, built the &#x27;Black Horse&#x27; brand. The business came with a baronetcy of Kensington Gore. His father bought Shorncliffe Lodge, in Sandgate Kent, where his cousin Mayer Rothschild was the MP. His father was not a successful backbencher, but the political influences had a profound effect on young Philip.

He was educated at Farnborough Prep school and Eton before going up to Oxford. At Eton, Sassoon made friend such as Denys Finch-Hatton. Old Etonian Arthur Balfour recommended the Debating Society to him. His father was also friendly with Frances Horner, wife of Sir John Horner, a longtime friend of Gladstone who lived at Mells Manor in Somerset. His house master was a member of the secret society of liberals, the Young Apostles. Also a near contemporary was Osbert Sitwell, the Yorkshireman and author. A French scholar, he learned the language doing classes at Windsor Castle. Sassoon was taught aesthetics by Henry Luxmoore giving an insight into philosophy and social realism. However he chose to read Modern History at Christ Church, Oxford. He was one of only 25 Jewish undergraduates, but was invited to join the Bullingdon Club. He joined the East Kent Yeomanry while still at Oxford and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

Philip Sassoon entered Parliament in 1912. After the death of his relative David Gubbay (1865–1928), Sassoon became chairman of his family&#x27;s company, David Sassoon &amp; Co., although his participation in the management of it was only nominal. However, he continued to be a shareholder.

A 2016 biography, &quot;Charmed Life: The Phenomenal World of Philip Sassoon&quot; by Damian Collins, his successor as Member of Parliament for Hythe, provides a great deal of additional information about Sassoon. A summary by &quot;The Guardian&quot; includes this comment:Sassoon enjoyed witty gossip, but was never spiteful. He spoke with a clipped sibilant lisp, and liked to relax in a blue silk smoking jacket with slippers of zebra hide. He had fickle, moody fascinations with young men with whom he soon grew bored, but was loyally appreciative of female friends and kept an inner court of elderly, cultivated, ironical bachelors. His sexuality was central to his character and activities, but there is never any hint of sexual activity in the many memories of him. One hates to think that he was as sublimated as he sounds. His restlessness and fatalism, which were notorious among his friends, killed him at the age of 50 in 1939: although his physicians ordered bed rest after a viral infection, he hurtled about in unnecessary gaieties until his body was beyond recovery.

==First World War==
Sassoon served as private secretary to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig during the First World War from 1915 to 1918. Sassoon was present at the meeting on 1 December 1914 at the Chateau Demont at Merville in France, when King George V and Edward Prince of Wales met with Raymond Poincaré, President of France, and the Generals Joseph Joffre, Ferdinand Foch and Sir Henry Rawlinson. The allies showed their determination to fight Germany and the Central Powers. Because of his &quot;numerous social and political connections&quot;, Sassoon, at that time a second lieutenant in the Royal East Kent Yeomanry, was in attendance. A square bronze plaque commemorating the occasion was auctioned in 2012.

==Political career==
He was Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Hythe from 1912, succeeding his father, initially as the &quot;Baby of the House&quot;. As an MP, he advocated aviation and bought his own aeroplane in 1919. In his role as undersecretary in the air ministry, he promoted civilian air travel.

Sassoon was Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Lloyd George in 1920. Between 1924 and 1929 and again from 1931 until 1937 he served as Under-Secretary of State for Air, and gained much prominence in political circles. He was appointed a Privy Councillor in the 1929 Dissolution Honours. In 1937 he became First Commissioner of Works, a post which he held until his death, aged fifty, two years later.

He idolised the Prince of Wales, and supported the King during the abdication crisis of 1936. According to a review of the 2016 biography, &quot;he wanted international peace at any cost, and convinced himself that Hitler&#x27;s promises were dependable.&quot;

==Trent Park==
He had a reputation for being one of the greatest hosts in Britain. Although he owned a house at Park Lane, Sassoon arranged for Herbert Baker to design another home for him in 1912, Port Lympne in Kent. (Decades later, it became the Port Lympne Wild Animal Park.) &quot;It was a unique building, Italianate and Moorish in its influence, built for a voluptuary of the senses who wanted his rooms to be a rapturous medley of strong, exotic colours and filled with the luscious fragrance of flowers. The formal grounds at Port Lympne were like a Hollywood version of Tuscany,&quot; according to a summary of his 2016 biography.

He also owned Trent Park and hired Philip Tilden to largely rebuild that mansion located in Cockfosters. Stylistic differences between the two houses illustrate changes in taste among members of British high society of the period. Trent Park possessed a landscape designed by Humphrey Repton but the existing house was Victorian and undistinguished. Sassoon had the Victorian additions demolished or altered, except for the west service wing, between 1926 and 1931. The projecting wings were added to the entrance (south) front. These modifications led to a large mansion in early Georgian-style. It became one of the houses of the age according to one report, &quot;a dream of another world – the white-coated footmen serving endless courses of rich but delicious food, the Duke of York coming in from golf... Winston Churchill arguing over the teacups with George Bernard Shaw, Lord Balfour dozing in an armchair, Rex Whistler absorbed in his painting... while Philip himself flitted from group to group, an alert, watchful, influential but unobtrusive stage director – all set against a background of mingled luxury, simplicity and informality, brilliantly contrived...&quot;

This atmosphere, as Clive Aslet has suggested, represented a complete about-face from Sassoon&#x27;s earlier extravagance at Port Lympne to what Aslet called &quot;an appreciation of English reserve.&quot; In the words of Christopher Hussey, at Trent Sassoon caught &quot;that indefinable and elusive quality, the spirit of a country house... an essence of cool, flowery, chintzy, elegant, unobtrusive rooms that rises in the mind when we are thinking of country houses.&quot;

Sassoon conducted excavations of Camlet Moat at Trent Park in the 1920s and was reported to have found oak beams which formed the basis of a drawbridge, Roman shoes and daggers as well as mosaic tiles depicting a knight mounted on a white horse. The foundations of a large stone building were also found. English Heritage refilled the excavations in 1999.

==Port Lympne Mansion==
Neither the eye-popping interiors nor the extravagant gardens at Port Lympne Mansion could be described as in any way &quot;reserved&quot;, or even &quot;English&quot;. In fact, one reviewer of a 2016 bio about Sassoon described it as a &quot;sybaritic mansion&quot;. Mark Girouard has written of the &quot;quiet good taste expected of a country gentleman&quot; against which Philip may have chafed in his younger years, apparently torn between the standards of &quot;Country Life&quot; and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His Ballets Russes-inspired dining room at Port Lympne with its lapis walls, opalescent ceiling, gilt-winged chairs with jade-green cushions, all surmounted by a frieze of scantily-clad Africans, suggests the outsider confidence of a Rothschild and of an openly gay man.

Philip Tilden added a bachelor&#x27;s wing with Moorish courtyard, which Lady Honor Channon, (wife of Chips), unkindly likened to a Spanish brothel, to accommodate young airmen from nearby Romney Marsh flying field – among his other enthusiasms, Sir Philip was himself an aviator – and Tilden&#x27;s twin swimming pools and monumentally classical garden staircase were in much the same theatrical spirit.

One frequent guest was Lawrence of Arabia.

==Flying==

As Secretary of State for Air, Sassoon was Honorary Air Commodore of No. 601 (County of London) Squadron. The squadron was nicknamed &quot;The Millionaires’ Squadron&quot; because it was reported to have six millionaire members. In 1932 he was enthusiastic about the new Percival Gull monoplane and ordered his own model powered by a Napier Javelin 111 six cylinder engine, with the interior finished in red leather. In this luxurious Gull Four G-ACGR (currently on display at the Brussels Military Museum) he competed in the King’s Cup and the Folkestone Aero Trophy Race. He later became the owner of the first Percival Petrel two-engine monoplane, completed in 1938. As Under-secretary of State for Air, Sassoon carried out the first general inspection of British overseas air stations, flying the Blackburn Iris. Afterwards he wrote The Third Route, published by Heinemann in 1929, recounting the story of the development of the air route from England to India.

==Honours and decorations==
Sassoon was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1917. On 7 October 1919, it was announced that Sassoon had been awarded the French Croix de Guerre &quot;for distinguished services rendered during the course of the campaign&quot;. In 1923 he was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

In 2012 Sassoon&#x27;s set of decorations was sold at auction. The decorations included the GBE, made by the court-jeweller Garrard, the CMG neck badge, also by Garrard, 1914–15 Star (engraved Lieut. Sir P.A.D.G.Sassoon. R.E.Kent Yeo.); British War Medal and Victory Medal (engraved Major Sir P.A.D.G.Sassoon. R.E.Kent Yeo.); 1935 Jubilee Medal and 1937 Coronation Medal (both engraved A/Cdre Sir Philip Sassoon 601 Squ. A.A.F.); France, a decoration of a Knight of the Legion d’Honneur, a decoration of a Knight of the French Colonial Order of the Black Star; Belgium, Officer of the Order of the Crown; French Croix de Guerre and Belgian Croix de Guerre; mounted in the court style.

==The arts==
He was Chairman of the Trustees of the National Gallery from 1933 to 1935, and as Minister for Works in the 1930s he was responsible for embellishing many of London&#x27;s monuments and parks. He was also a trustee of British School at Rome. As a collector Philip Sassoon was, like many of the Rothschilds, drawn mainly to the English and French 18th century, but he also collected contemporary artists such as John Singer Sargent and William Orpen. A Mamuluk glass mosque lamp, once belonging to Sassoon can be found in the collection of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, Portugal.

==Personal life==
Sassoon was said to have lived an openly homosexual life. According to a reviewer of a 2016 biography of Sassoon, &quot;his personal life was something that he shut away from the world&quot;. There was only a single intimate letter among his personal papers, to &quot;Jack&quot;, a travel companion. The reviewer adds, &quot;despite his many gay and bisexual friends, away from &#x27;bohemian circles&#x27; it was still a taboo subject (homosexual acts were illegal). Sassoon was consequently regarded as an enigmatic solitary figure&quot;. Another reviewer offered that, &quot;His sexuality was central to his character and activities, but there is never any hint of sexual activity in the many memories of him&quot;.

Back in his Eton days, if not for Denys Finch-Hatton&#x27;s protection, he would have been badly bullied for being flamboyant, thus Sassoon became an ardent admirer of Denys and gave him a lavish ruby shirt studs and diamond cuff link as gifts. Denys threw them away, but decided to retrieve them to give it to his sister Lady Gladys.

==Death==
Sassoon died on 3 June 1939, aged 50, of complications from influenza. He left an estate valued at £1,980,892 () on which death duty of close on £800,000 was paid. His cousin Hannah Gubbay (1885–1968), the widow of David Gubbay, was the main beneficiary, inheriting Port Lympne, Trent Park and an annuity of £11,000 ().

After Sassoon&#x27;s death, he was described by his friend Noël Coward as &quot;a phenomenon that would never recur&quot;. According to biographer Damian Collins &quot;I think because he died just three months before the Second World War started, he became part of that lost golden era; war had closed a chapter on that&quot;.

<doc id="1190380" wikidata="Q859376" url="?curid=1190380" title="Volcán de Fuego">
<text>Volcán de Fuego (; Spanish for &quot;Volcano of Fire&quot;, often shortened to Fuego) or Chi Q&#x27;aq&#x27; (Kaqchikel for &quot;where the fire is&quot;) is an active stratovolcano in Guatemala, on the borders of Chimaltenango, Escuintla and Sacatepéquez departments.

Part of the mountain range of the Sierra Madre, the volcano sits about west of Antigua, one of Guatemala&#x27;s most famous cities and a tourist destination. It has erupted frequently, most recently in June and November 2018, 23 September 2021, 11 December 2022, and 4 May 2023.

Fuego is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Small explosions of gas and ash occur every 15 to 20 minutes, but larger eruptions are less frequent. Andesite and basalt lava types dominate.

The volcano is joined with Acatenango volcano to its north and collectively the complex is known as La Horqueta. Between Fuego and Acatenango is La Meseta, a scarp marking the remains of an older volcano that collapsed around 8,500 years ago. Fuego volcano started to grow after the collapse of La Meseta.

==Early expeditions==

In 1881, French writer Eugenio Dussaussay climbed the volcano, then practically unexplored. First, he needed to ask for permission to climb from the Sacatepéquez governor, who gave him a letter for the Alotenango mayor asking for his assistance with guides to help the explorer and his companion, Tadeo Trabanino. They wanted to climb the central peak, unexplored at the time, but could not find a guide and had to climb to the active cone, which had a recent eruption in 1880.

British archeologist Alfred Percival Maudslay climbed the volcano on 7 January 1892. Here is how he described his expedition:

==Notable eruptions==


===1717 destruction of Santiago de los Caballeros===
The strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the San Miguel earthquakes in 1717. In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volcán de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.

On 27 August there was a strong eruption of Volcán de Fuego, which lasted until 30 August; the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego. On 29 August a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel. Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00 pm there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o&#x27;clock. The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.

The San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed. There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower and extensive damage to the city infrastructure; not to mention numerous dead and injured. These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity. City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of elements in the Army Battalion to safeguard the order was considerable. The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720; although there are indications that there were more jobs done by Porres until 1736.

In 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).

===Eruption of 3 June 2018===
Fuego&#x27;s most recent period of activity began in 1999 and continues to the present day. This period consists of persistent low-level eruptive activity interspersed with occasional violent explosive &quot;paroxysmal&quot; eruptions. Paroxysmal eruptions (or &#x27;paroxysms&#x27;) produce a sustained eruptive plume from which ash falls on communities within 20 km of the volcano, lava flows reaching 1–2 km from the summit, and occasional pyroclastic density currents. The largest eruption of Fuego in its current period of activity happened on 3 June 2018, also the most powerful eruption of the volcano since 1974. Fuego generated large pyroclastic flows that gradually filled its drainage ravines (known locally as &quot;barrancas&quot;). The greatest impacts were on the east side of Fuego, where pyroclastic flows filled and eventually overcame the capacity of the Las Lajas ravine to descend on the nearby communities of San Miguel Los Lotes and El Rodeo in Escuintla and the private golf resort of La Reunión in Sacatepéquez. The flows that descended on Los Lotes buried the town in pyroclastic material and killed many of the residents, who had received limited warnings to evacuate. On 5 June, Associated Press reported that at least 99 people are dead and nearly 200 others were unaccounted for following the eruption. Ash fall extended as far as the capital, Guatemala City forcing the closure of La Aurora International Airport. 
The military assisted in clearing ash off the runway. Rescue attempts were seriously hampered as routes into the affected regions were seriously damaged by the pyroclastic flows.

<text>Tolimán is a stratovolcano in Guatemala, on the southern shores of Lake Atitlán. Part of the Sierra Madre mountain range, the volcano has an elevation of 3,158 m (10,361 ft) and was formed near the southern margin of the Pleistocene Atitlán III caldera. The top of the volcano has a shallow crater and its flanks are covered with the thick remains of ancient lava flows that emerged from vents in the volcano&#x27;s flanks.

== Cerro de Oro ==
A parasitic lava dome, known as Cerro de Oro, was formed on the volcano&#x27;s northern flank, which may have erupted a few thousand years ago.

<doc id="1190401" wikidata="Q123532575" url="?curid=1190401" title="McMahon clans">
<text>McMahon, also spelt MacMahon (older Irish orthography: ; reformed Irish orthography: ), were different Middle Age era Irish clans. Their name is derived from the Gaelic &quot;Mac&quot; &quot;Mathghamhna&quot; meaning &#x27;son of the bear&#x27;. According to historian C. Thomas Cairney, the MacMahons were one of the chiefly families of the Dal gCais or Dalcassians who were a tribe of the Erainn who were the second wave of Celts to settle in Ireland between about 500 and 100 BC.

==The MacMahons of Thomond (County Clare)==

The Thomond MacMahons were part of the great tribal grouping, the Dál gCais, and claimed descent from Mahon O&#x27;Brien, son of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. Corcu Baiscin was held by the descendants of Carbry Bascain until the 11th century, when the descendants of Mahon O’Brien conquered them.

According to Frost, Mahone &#x27;a quo MacMahon&#x27; died in 1129, leaving two sons Murtagh and Dermot, with Murtagh being the ancestor of the main line of McMahons in Clare. The McMahons seized the Corcabaskin territory in the south of what is now County Clare in the 12th century about the same time as they adopted the fixed surname.

Quoting the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, Frost says that Donogh MacMahon, Lord of Corcabaskin, died in 1488 and two MacMahons, Brian and Teige Roe, were established in his place – Brian in West Corcabaskin (known as Moyarta) and Teige Roe in the East (known as Clonderalaw). The two ruling branches of the clan became firmly established in Corcabaskin, West Clare, where their once strongholds, Carrigaholt Castle and Clonderlaw Castle, are prominent landmarks and a source of local interest today.

In August 1585, the Irish leaders of Thomond were forced to sign an Indenture with Sir John Perrott, the English Lord Deputy of Ireland. Frost says that &quot;some of the signatories of the Deed of Composition seem to have been bribed into conformity by Perrott&quot;, including Teige MacMahon ... of Clonderalaw and Turlough MacMahon of Moyarta. They were allowed to retain their castles and lands free of crown rent. The two MacMahons would have received the English titles of Baronet, replacing their traditional Irish titles, about this time. The two sons who succeeded them as heads of their families certainly each carried the English title.
The last chief of the West Corcabaskin MacMahons, Sir Teige Caech MacMahon, was killed at or shortly after the battle of Kinsale in 1602, and his title became extinct.

Sir Turlough Roe MacMahon, Baronet of East Corcabaskin, received the honour of becoming High Sheriff of County Clare in 1609. He died in 1629. According to an Inquisition held at Ennis in 1630 (reported in Frost&#x27;s &quot;History ... of Clare&quot;), Turlough&#x27;s title was inherited by his eldest son, Sir Teige MacMahon. Sir Teige (or Teague) represented the Earl of Thomond in negotiations with Sir William Penn in 1646, but in 1651 General Ireton seized Clonderlaw Castle from Sir Teige. Frost&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; records 31 Townlands in County Clare being seized from Sir Teague. James Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Cromwellian Settlement of the County of Limerick&quot; mentions Sir Teague MacMahon as the holder of other lands in that County.

There is evidence that Sir Teague had a son called Turlough (or Terlagh). Honour, Lady Dowager of Kerry and Lixnaw, was granted the &quot;guardianship and tuition of Torlogh MacMahon, son and heir to Teague MacMahon&quot; on 27 June 1673 (recorded in MS Carte 38, fol(s) 742v (Carte Calendar Vol 52, 1673–1674, Bodleian Library, Uni of Oxford). Ainsworth&#x27;s edited Inchiquin Manuscripts, MS No 1845, at p. 625, contains a note made following the death of Mary Rua O&#x27;Brien in 1686 which refers to &quot;her nephew Sir Terlagh McMahon&quot;. The title appears to have died out with him.

After the defeats of the native Irish in the 17th century, many of the Clare MacMahons emigrated to serve in the Irish Brigade of the French Army.

Patrice de MacMahon (1808–1893), was created Duke of Magenta, appointed Marshal of France, and later the President of France. The MacMahon family are still prominent in France; the family home is the Château de Sully outside Dijon.

===Motto===
The motto of the Thomond sept of McMahons is &quot;Sic Nos Sic Sacra Tuemur&quot;, which means &quot;Thus We Defend Our Sacred Rights” being Protectors of Church properties owned by the Kings of Thomond being the O&#x27;Brien Clan. The McMahon Clan is directly descended from legendary General and High King of Ireland Brian Boru &quot;Conquorer of the Danes at Clontarf&quot;. As are the O&#x27;Briens, who the McMahons have fought and married for 1,000 years.

==The MacMahons of Oriel (Monaghan)==

===Motto===
In the old Irish orthography, the Oriel MacMahon motto is &quot;So Dorn Dona Dhubhfuillibh&quot; and &quot;So Dorn Dona Dhubhfuiltish&quot; in reformed. 
The motto was originally a battle cry and roughly translates to &quot;Here&#x27;s a fist to the dark-blooded&quot;,&quot;This hand is raised against tyrants&quot;,&quot;Beware of retaliatory blows&quot; or &quot;Guard against counterblows&quot;.

===History===
The MacMahons of Oriel are a sept, or sub-clan, of Clann Nadsluaigh. They trace descent from The Three Collas to their patronymic namesake, Niall Mac Mathghamhna, who descended from Mathgamna, Lord of the ancient kingdom of Fernmaige, located in the modern Baroney of Farney. They ruled the kingdom of Oriel (Anglicisation of Airgíalla) from 1243 to 1590 C.E. The Airgíalla Kingship was ended when Rossa Buidhe MacMahon, found himself in a geopolitically untenable position of his kingdom wedged between an expanding Tudor Kingdom of Ireland and Tír Eoghain under the O&#x27;Neill. Rossa Buidhe agreed to surrender and regrant his territories to the English Crown in Ireland and they became County Monaghan in the Kingdom of Ireland. The county was subdivided into five baronies with Farney, Cremorne, Dartrey, and Monaghan controlled by MacMahons and Truagh by McKennas.

The MacMahons lost control of Monaghan after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Led by Colla Mac O&#x27;brian MacMahon, the MacMahons rose in revolt with O&#x27;Neill and other Ulster clans in an attempt to seize Dublin Castle and overthrow the English Tudor kingdom. While the plot to capture Dublin Castle failed, the McMahons captured Castleblaney and Carrickmacross in Monaghan. However, the English defeated the Irish uprising and Monaghan land was passed to Protestant settlers.

It was a MacMahon, Colonel Hugh Oge&#x27;s loose lips, that were responsible for letting slip the plot to seize Dublin Castle. He had drunkenly told his Protestant foster brother Owen Connolly, who subsequently betrayed him and he was captured. With the help of two priests and a Scottish maid, Hugh Oge escaped from the Tower of London by sawing through his bars on 18 August 1644. However, he was recaptured 5 weeks later. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in London on 22 November 1644.

John O&#x27;Hart also noted that the early MacMahons (sometimes called O&#x27;Mahons) were chiefs of the over-kingdom of Ulaid, which bordered Airgíalla.

<doc id="1190403" wikidata="Q2567279" url="?curid=1190403" title="Bizarre Love Triangle">
<text>&quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; is a song by English rock band New Order, released as a single in November 1986 from their fourth studio album, &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (1986), which reached the top five on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart, and 5 on the Australian ARIA Charts in March 1987. It failed to enter the top 40 of both the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; however, a new mix included on &quot;The Best of New Order&quot; was released in 1994 and charted at No. 98 on the Hot 100. In 2004, the song was ranked No. 204 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot;

==Releases==
The 12-inch version, remixed by Shep Pettibone, also appears on the compilation &quot;Substance&quot; and a second remix by Stephen Hague features on their &quot;Best Of&quot; album. The original album version appears on the 2005 compilation &quot;Singles&quot;, the 7-inch version appears on the 2016 reissue of this compilation. New Order&#x27;s live versions since 1998 are based on the Shep Pettibone remix.

The single mix features more electronics than the album version, with the Fairlight CMI music workstation used to provide sounds such as the orchestral hits, and to sequence the song. All instruments except vocals and Peter Hook&#x27;s melodic bass were sequenced (the song also prominently features synthesised bass and synth choir parts).

==Reception==
&quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; has been critically acclaimed since its release. In a 30th anniversary retrospective citing the song as one of the greatest of all time, &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as a &quot;synth-pop masterpiece&quot; and &quot;an incandescent jewel of mid-&#x27;80s computer love.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; praised the song as New Order&#x27;s &quot;finest pop moment&quot; and credited its simplicity in comparison to previous singles such as &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. In 2004, the song was ranked No. 204 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked the song No. 2 on their list of the 10 greatest New Order songs, and in 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song No. 7 on their list of the 30 greatest New Order songs.

==Music video==
The music video, which was released in November 1986, was directed by American artists Robert Longo and Gretchen Bender. It prominently featured shots of a man and a woman in business suits flying through the air as though propelled by trampolines; this is based directly on Longo&#x27;s &quot;Men in the Cities&quot; series of lithographs. The video has a black and white cut-scene where Jodi Long and E. Max Frye are arguing about reincarnation, in which Long emphatically declares &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in reincarnation because I refuse to come back as a bug or as a rabbit!&quot; Frye responds, &quot;You know, you&#x27;re a real &#x27;up&#x27; person,&quot; before the song resumes. It also features clips that Gretchen would later use for her next project &quot;Total Recall&quot;.

==Track listings==

* Initial pressings (matrix FAC-26-A) were the UK 7-inch mix; later pressings (matrix FAC-26-A2) were the Canadian 7-inch mix

* US editions mis-credit &quot;Bizarre Dub Triangle&quot; as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, reputedly due to a record company person contacting New Order&#x27;s Manager Rob Gretton to ask what to name the mix as, Gretton is claimed to have said &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot;
==Personnel==
* Bernard Sumner – lead and backing vocals, synthesizers and programming
* Peter Hook – bass, electronic percussion, programming
* Stephen Morris – drums, synthesizers and programming
* Gillian Gilbert – synthesizers and programming

==Charts==

===Weekly charts===

===Year-end charts===

==Cover versions and remixes==
* Australian band Frente! released an acoustic cover version of the song in 1994, re-imagining it as a folk ballad. Issued as part of the &quot;Lonely&quot; EP in their home country, the cover peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Singles Chart and became a hit overseas, reaching No. 49 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 53 in Canada, and No. 76 in the United Kingdom. In Australia, it came in at No. 63 on the 1994 year-end chart and was certified gold for shipments of over 35,000.
* The song was remixed in 2005 by the Crystal Method (for their album &quot;Community Service II&quot;) and by Richard X (for the New Order single &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot;).

<doc id="1190421" wikidata="Q2920090" url="?curid=1190421" title="William Peel, 1st Earl Peel">
<text>William Robert Wellesley Peel, 1st Earl Peel (7 January 1867 – 28 September 1937), styled 2nd Viscount Peel from 1912 to 1929, was a British politician who was a local councillor, a Member of Parliament and a member of the House of Lords. After an early career as a barrister and a journalist, he entered first local and then national politics. He rose to hold a number of ministerial positions but is probably best remembered for chairing the Peel Commission in 1936–1937, which recommended for the first time the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states.

The grandson of a Conservative prime minister, he was unusual even for his period in the number of political parties for which he was elected. He began as a member of the Moderate Party on the London County Council and later became the leader of the renamed Municipal Reform Party; he was then elected as an MP for the Liberal Unionists and then for the Conservative Party before he inherited his seat in the Lords in 1912. He also served as a minister in governments led by Liberal, Conservative and Labour prime ministers.

His ministerial career began as Under-Secretary of State for War in 1919, and he entered the cabinet in 1922 as Secretary of State for India and held a number of other ministerial positions.

==Early life and career==
The eldest son of Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel, and Adelaide Dugdale, William Peel was born in London in 1867. His father was the fifth and youngest son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel.

Peel was educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was secretary of the Oxford Union.

In 1893, he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple and practised as a barrister before taking the position of special correspondent for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.

==Political career==
In 1900, Peel was appointed a member of the Royal Commission that was formed to inquire into the operation of the Port of London. In February the same year, he began his political career when he was elected in a by-election to fill a vacant seat for Woolwich in the London County Council to which he was re-elected in the ordinary election the following year. He was a member of the Moderate pro-Conservative grouping on the council that became the Municipal Reform Party. He was leader of the party from 1908 to 1910 and chairman of the county council from 1914 to 1916.
He began his parliamentary career when he was elected as Liberal Unionist MP for Manchester South at the 1900 Manchester South by-election. At the next general election in 1906, he stood unsuccessfully at Harrow. He returned to the Commons in 1909, when he was elected as Conservative MP for Taunton at a by-election. He inherited his father&#x27;s viscountcy in 1912 and so moved to the House of Lords.

Peel was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Bedfordshire and lieutenant-colonel of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry in 1912 and, at the outbreak of the First World War moved to France with his regiment, but ill health made him return to Britain in 1915. In 1918, he received his first government post as Joint Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of National Service in the coalition government of David Lloyd George. In 1919, Peel became Under-Secretary of State for War and a member of the Privy Council. Two years later, he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for Transport.

He entered the cabinet in 1922 as Secretary of State for India, and, after the downfall of Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition, continued to hold the post during the premierships of Andrew Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin. The latter&#x27;s government fell in January 1924, but after a brief spell in opposition, it was returned to power at the 1924 general election. Peel was appointed First Commissioner of Works in the Conservative administration formed by Baldwin. In 1928, Peel briefly returned to the India Office, but the Conservatives lost power by the 1929 general election.

In 1929, Peel was created Viscount Clanfield, of Clanfield in the County of Southampton, and Earl Peel in that year&#x27;s Dissolution Honours. When a Conservative-dominated National Government was formed after the 1931 election, he became Lord Privy Seal but held that office for only two months and left government in November.

In 1932, he was appointed chairman of the Wheat Commission, and in 1934, he chaired the Royal Commission on the Common Law. In 1936–1937, he chaired the Peel Commission, which recommended for the first time the partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states.

==Family==
Peel married in 1899 the Honourable Eleanor Williamson (1871–1949), daughter of James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton. They had two children:
*Lady Doris Peel (1900–1983), who married in 1927 Colonel Stewart Blacker (1887–1964), and had four children. She was a Justice of the Peace for the County of London in 1939, and for Sussex in 1948.
*Arthur Peel, 2nd Earl Peel (1901–1969)

In 1929, Ashton died, and Peel succeeded him as chairman of James Williamson and Company. He was a director of Barclays Bank and of the Great Northern Railway.

==Death==
Lord Peel died at 70 in his home in East Meon, near Petersfield, Hampshire, in 1937 after a long illness. He was succeeded in his titles by his son, Arthur.

<text>The River Sullane () runs from the mountains between County Cork and County Kerry in southern Ireland, near the village of Cúil Aodha. After passing Ballyvourney, it runs through the centre of Macroom, to which it provides drinking water (and occasionally floods). The Sullane is joined by the River Bohill at Ballyvourney, the River Foherish at Clondrohid, about 5 kilometres west of Macroom and the River Launa locally known as &quot;The Launey&quot; one kilometre east of the town. The Sullane joins the River Lee a further kilometre east.

The river is well stocked with trout, and also contains European perch (200 g average), minnow and a small number of pike. In 2024, effluent released from the Macroom Wastewater Treatment Plant polluted the Sullane; Uisce Éireann and Glanua Ireland (a company managing the plant) were later fined for the release.

<text>Werneth Low (; ) is a hill in Greater Manchester, England, and a part of the Pennines. It is located on the border of Stockport and Tameside, rising to a height of . The villages of Woodley, Greave, Gee Cross, Mottram and Romiley lie on the sides of the low.

The term &quot;low&quot; does not refer to any lack of altitude, it being a northern English word for hill.

Werneth Low offers panoramic views over the Greater Manchester Urban Area and, in clear weather, the Winter Hill transmitting station can be seen from here. To the south, Stockport town centre, part of Wythenshawe in south Manchester and the Welsh mountains can be viewed in clear weather.

The majority of Werneth Low is administered jointly by Hyde War Memorial Trust and Tameside Council. The trust organises the Remembrance and Peace day services. It was established to be the guardian of Werneth Low, to keep it &quot;For the people of Hyde&quot; and provide a lasting monument to the 710 men of Hyde who perished in World War I.

Various landmarks can be seen from the top of Werneth Low, including: Manchester&#x27;s Deansgate Square, Beetham Tower, the Oldham Civic Centre and Jodrell Bank Observatory&#x27;s radio telescope (visible from the south-western end of the hilltop).

==History==
A flint knife and a Bronze Age stone mace head have been discovered on Werneth Low. Hangingbank is the site of a possible Iron Age farmstead dating to the first millennium BC, enclosed by a double ditch and featuring crop marks. A Roman road from Melandra to Astbury probably crosses the hill, however the exact course has not been identified. The site covers . There is also evidence of Romano-British activity on Werneth Low; a sherd of Roman pottery dating to the 2nd century AD was discovered in the material filling one of the ditches at Hangingbank, indicating that was when the site fell out of use. There is a possible temporary Roman camp and excavations have recovered a posthole. The name Werneth derives from the Welsh &quot;verno&quot; for alder meaning &#x27;the place where alders grow&#x27;.

The Higham family owned the land from at least 1330 and it is from them that the upper and lower Higham Farms take their name. In 1920, Lower Higham Farm and all of its land was purchased by the War Memorial Committee of the Hyde Borough Council and, in 1921, Hyde&#x27;s main war memorial was officially unveiled. Being dedicated to remembering and being diligent about the 710 men who lost their lives for Hyde&#x27;s wellbeing. A Royal Observer Corps monitoring post was active here from 1962 to 1968, which was intended to give warning of hostile aircraft and nuclear attacks on the United Kingdom. In the late 1980s, Greater Manchester Council, Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council and the Hyde War Memorial Trust worked together to establish Werneth Low country park, which covers ; the park was officially opened in 1980.

==Transport==
Werneth Low was served by bus number 304 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays only. With effect from 31 January 2010, GMPTE diverted this bus onto routes on which other bus services run and, as a result, Werneth Low is no longer served by any form of public transport.

<doc id="1190436" wikidata="Q2900646" url="?curid=1190436" title="Bhaja Govindam">
<text>&quot;Bhaja Govindam&quot; (), also known as &quot;Moha Mudgara&quot; (), is a popular Hindu devotional poem in Sanskrit composed by Adi Shankara. It underscores the view that &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion) is also important along with &quot;jñāna&quot; (knowledge), as emphasised by the bhakti movement.

==Legend ==
There is a legend related to the composition of this hymn. It is said that Adi Shankara, accompanied by his disciples, was walking along a street in Varanasi one day, when he came across an old aged scholar reciting the rules of Sanskrit grammar of Panini repeatedly on the street. Taking pity on him, Adi Shankara went up to the scholar and advised him not to waste his time on grammar at his age, but to turn his mind to God in worship and adoration, which would only save him from this vicious cycle of life and death. The hymn &quot;Bhaja Govindam&quot; is said to have been composed on this occasion.

==Significance==
This composition is a reminder that Adi Shankara, who is often regarded as reviver of the &quot;jnana marga&quot;, or &quot;path of knowledge&quot;, to attain &quot;moksha&quot;, was also a proponent of the &quot;bhakti marga&quot; (path of devotion) to attain the same goal. As C. Rajagopalachari put in his commentary, &quot;When intelligence (jnana) matures and lodges securely in the heart, it becomes wisdom (vignyana). When that wisdom (vignyana) is integrated with life and issues out in action, it becomes devotion (bhakti). Knowledge (jnana) which has become mature is spoken of as devotion (bhakti). If it does not get transformed into devotion (bhakti), such knowledge (jnana) is useless tinsel.&quot;

In this prayer, Adi Shankara emphasizes the importance of devotion for God as a means to spiritual development and to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. The prayer leaves one in no doubt that the renunciation of our egotistical differences and surrender to God makes for salvation. Many scholars hold that this composition encapsulates with both brevity and simplicity the substance of all Vedantic thought found in whatever other works that Adi Shankara wrote: 

&quot;The refrain &quot;Bhaja Govindam&quot;, which defines the composition and gives it its name, invokes the almighty in the aspect of Krishna; it is therefore very popular not only with Sri Adi Shankaracharya&#x27;s immediate followers, the Smarthas, but also with Vaishnavas and others.&quot;

==Meter / Chandas==
The metre is moraic (मात्राछन्दस्). Apart from the first verse, all other verses have 16 matras, which tend to fit the description of the padakulakam variety of matrasamaka [मात्रासमक] in vrtta-ratnakara.

<doc id="1190440" wikidata="Q442788" url="?curid=1190440" title="Amir Taheri">
<text>Amir Taheri (; born 9 June 1942) is an Iranian-born journalist, author, intellectual, scholar of Middle Eastern politics and activist based in Europe. His writings focus on the Middle East affairs and topics related to Islamic terrorism. He is the current Chairman of Gatestone Institute in Europe.

==Career==
Taheri was born in Ahvaz. His biography at Benador Associates stated that he was educated in Tehran, London, and Paris. He was the executive editor-in-chief of &quot;Kayhan,&quot; a &quot;strongly pro-Shah&quot; Iranian daily, from 1972 to 1979, and a member of the board of trustees of the Iranian Institute for International Political and Economic Studies in Tehran from 1973 to 1979. Taheri has also been editor-in-chief of &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; (1985–1987), Middle East correspondent for the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot; (1980–1984), and has written for the Pakistan &quot;Daily Times,&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Daily Mail.&quot; He was a member of the executive board of the International Press Institute from 1984 to 1992.

He has been a columnist (often as an &quot;op ed&quot; writer) for &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; and its sister publication &quot;Arab News,&quot; &quot;International Herald Tribune,&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; &quot;Newsday,&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; He has also written for &quot;Die Welt,&quot; &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, in Germany, &quot;La Repubblica&quot; in Italy, &quot;L&#x27;Express,&quot; &quot;Politique internationale&quot; (where he is part of the Consulting Committee) and &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur &quot;in France, &quot;El Mundo&quot; in Spain, and The Times in the UK, the German weekly &quot;Focus&quot; magazine, the &quot;National Review&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post.&quot;

Taheri is a commentator for CNN and is frequently interviewed by other media, including the BBC and the RFI. He has written several TV documentaries dealing with various issues of the Muslim world. He has interviewed many world leaders including Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, King Faisal, Mikhail Gorbachev, President Anwar Sadat, Zhou Enlai, Indira Gandhi and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

Taheri has published several books, some of which have been translated into 20 languages. In 1988 Publishers Weekly in New York chose his study of Islamist terrorism, &quot;Holy Terror: Inside the World of Islamic Terrorism,&quot; as one of the best books of the year. His most recent book, &quot;Persian Night: Iran under the Khomeinist Revolution&quot;, (2009) discusses the Islamic Republic&#x27;s history, current political landscape, and geopolitical ambitions.

==Controversies and fabrications==
Taheri has been the subject of many controversies involving allegations of producing fabrications in his writings, the most notable of which was the 2006 Iranian sumptuary law controversy. 

===&quot;Nest of Spies&quot;===
Shaul Bakhash, a historian in Mideast history at George Mason University, wrote in a review of Taheri&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;Nest of Spies&quot; in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that Taheri concocts conspiracies in his writings, and noted that he &quot;repeatedly refers us to books where the information he cites simply does not exist. Often the documents cannot be found in the volumes he attributes them... [He] repeatedly reads things into the documents that are not there.&quot; Bakhash stated that Taheri&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Nest of Spies&quot; is &quot;the sort of book that gives contemporary history a bad name&quot;.

===Claims of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s death in 2002===
Taheri&#x27;s byline was attached to an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of 11 July 2002 under the title &quot;The Death of bin Ladenism&quot;. His clip claimed, &quot;Osama bin Laden is dead. The news first came from sources in Afghanistan and Pakistan almost six months ago&quot;.

===Iranian sumptuary law hoax===

On 19 May 2006, the &quot;National Post&quot; of Canada published two pieces, one by Taheri, claiming that the Iranian parliament passed a law that &quot;envisages separate dress codes for religious minorities, Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, who will have to adopt distinct colour schemes to make them identifiable in public.&quot;
Numerous other sources, including Maurice Motamed, the Jewish member of the Iranian parliament, refuted the report as untrue. The Associated Press later refuted the report as well, saying that &quot;a draft law moving through parliament encourages Iranians to wear Islamic clothing to protect the country&#x27;s Muslim identity but does not mention special attire for religious minorities, according to a copy obtained Saturday by the Associated Press.&quot; Reuters also reported that &quot;A copy of the bill obtained by Reuters contained no such references. Reuters correspondents who followed the dress code session in parliament as it was broadcast on state radio heard no discussion of prescriptions for religious minorities.&quot;

Taheri insisted that his report was correct and that &quot;the dress code law has been passed by the Islamic Majlis and will now be submitted to the Council of Guardians&quot;, claiming that &quot;special markers for followers of Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism are under discussion as a means to implement the law&quot;.

The &quot;National Post&quot; retracted the story several hours after posting it online. The newspaper blamed Taheri for the falsehood in the article, and published a full apology on 24 May. Taheri stood by his article.

Taheri&#x27;s PR agent Eliana Benador defended his story. &quot;Benador explained that, regarding Iran, accuracy is &#x27;a luxury...As much as being accurate is important, in the end it&#x27;s important to side with what&#x27;s right. What&#x27;s wrong is siding with the terrorists.&#x27;&quot;

In 2007, Rudy Giuliani campaign adviser Norman Podhoretz wrote an article in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine called &quot;The Case for Bombing Iran,&quot; which included the following quotation (allegedly from Ayatollah Khomeini): &quot;We do not worship Iran, we worship Allah. For patriotism is another name for paganism. I say let this land [Iran] burn. Let this land go up in smoke, provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world.&quot; The quotation, which was later repeated by Podhoretz on the PBS NewsHour, and by Michael Ledeen in &quot;National Review&quot;, surprised Bakhash, who had never heard it before and found it out of character for Khomeni. Bakhash traced the quotation back to a book by Taheri and reported that &quot;no one can find the book Taheri claimed as his source in the Library of Congress or a search of Persian works in libraries worldwide. The statement itself can&#x27;t be found in databases and published collections of Khomeini statements and speeches.&quot;

===Javad Zarif accusations===
Dwight Simpson of San Francisco State University and Kaveh Afrasiabi have written that Taheri and his publisher Eliana Benador fabricated false stories in the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 2005 where Taheri identified Iran&#x27;s UN ambassador Javad Zarif as one of the students involved in the 1979 seizure of hostages at the US Embassy in Tehran. Zarif was Simpson&#x27;s teaching assistant and a graduate student in the Department of International Relations of San Francisco State University.

===Hoax of Hanging of Gay Teenagers in Isfahan===
In July 2015, days after the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Taheri tweeted that &quot;14-year-old Akbar Zargarzadeh hanged from a tree in Islamic boys&#x27; camp after camp&#x27;s mullah accused him of being gay deserving death.&quot; Shortly afterward, American LGBT activist Scott Long contacted Iranian queer organizations and Persian-speaking people, and found out that Taheri&#x27;s claim was a hoax.

<doc id="1190441" wikidata="Q1869175" url="?curid=1190441" title="London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War">
<text>The London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval War was a proposed international code of maritime law, especially as it relates to wartime activities, in 1909 at the London Naval Conference by the leading European naval powers, the United States and Japan, after a multinational conference that occurred in 1908 in London. The declaration largely reiterated existing law, but dealt with many controversial points, including blockades, contraband and prize, and showed greater regard to the rights of neutral entities.

The declaration was signed by most of the great powers of the day: Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (It was also signed by the Netherlands and Spain.)
However, no state ever ratified the declaration and consequently it never came into force. The United States insisted that the belligerent nations fighting in World War I abide by the Declaration, while the British and Germans increasingly ignored it.

The British geostrategist and naval historian Sir Julian Corbett argued strongly against the provisions of the Declaration, which sought to outlaw &#x27;general capture&#x27; of enemy commerce on the high seas during wartime. In his earlier 1907 essay &#x27;The Capture of Private Property at Sea&#x27;, he argued that the curtailment of the Royal Navy&#x27;s right to seize enemy shipping would have a detrimental impact on Britain&#x27;s ability to wage economic warfare against a continental enemy, economic warfare being the single most important function of the Navy, in his view. The arguments he set out gained currency within the Navy and British government, and would eventually prevail with Britain&#x27;s decision not to ratify the Declaration and the successful waging of maritime economic warfare, including &#x27;general capture&#x27;, against Germany during the First World War.

In any case, the London Declaration was greatly deficient in referring only to surface ships and completely ignoring submarine warfare, which was to play a major role in both World Wars.

<doc id="1190449" wikidata="Q3737152" url="?curid=1190449" title="Donald Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow">
<text>Donald Bradley Somervell, Baron Somervell of Harrow, (24 August 1889 – 18 November 1960) was a British barrister, judge and Conservative Party politician. He served as Solicitor General and Attorney General from 1933 to 1945 and was briefly Home Secretary in Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1945 caretaker government.

==Background, education and legal career==
Somervell was the son of Robert Somervell, master and bursar of Harrow School, and was educated at Harrow before reading Chemistry with a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a First in 1911. In 1912 he was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, the first chemist to be elected. He then joined the Inner Temple, but his legal training was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. Commissioned into the British Army, he served with the Middlesex Regiment and the 53rd Brigade in India and Mesopotamia. For his war service, he was appointed OBE in 1919.

Having been called to the bar &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1916, he completed his pupillage and practiced in the chambers of William Jowitt, specialising in commercial law matters arising out of the Treaty of Versailles. He became King&#x27;s Counsel in 1929.

==Political career==
In 1929 he entered politics. Although supporting the Liberal Party by inclination, its decline and his admiration for Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin led him to join the Conservative Party. He stood unsuccessfully for Crewe in the 1929 general election. He won the seat in the 1931 election and held it for 14 years.

In 1933, he became Solicitor General, receiving the customary knighthood, followed three years later by a promotion to Attorney General. In the latter post, he served for nine years during which he oversaw crises such as the Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII. He was the longest-serving Attorney General since 1754. He was sworn of the Privy Council in the 1938 Birthday Honours. He was Recorder of Kingston upon Thames from 1940 to 1946.

In 1945, he was briefly Home Secretary in Winston Churchill&#x27;s caretaker government. Both the government and Somervell were defeated in that year&#x27;s general election.

==Judicial career==
In 1946, Somervell was made a Lord Justice of Appeal by Clement Attlee. In 1951 Churchill returned to power but passed over Somervell&#x27;s claims to the Lord Chancellorship. On 4 October 1954 Somervell became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and, as a Law Lord, he received a life peerage as Baron Somervell of Harrow, of Ewelme in the County of Oxford. He retired in 1960, shortly before his death.

==Family==

Somervell married Loelia Helen Buchan-Hepburn, daughter of Sir Archibald Buchan-Hepburn, 4th Baronet, in 1933. She died in July 1945, aged 48. Somervell survived her by fifteen years and died in November 1960, aged 71. His grave can be found in the grounds of Saint Mary&#x27;s Church in Ewelme, opposite that of the writer Jerome K. Jerome.

<text>Geert Adriaans Boomgaard (21 September 1788; baptized 23 September 1788 – 3 February 1899) was a Dutch supercentenarian and is generally accepted by scholars as the first validated case on record.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Little is known about Boomgaard&#x27;s life: he was born in Groningen, Netherlands. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763–1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762–1834). His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert had the same job. In addition to captaining a boat, other sources say that he also served as a soldier in the Dutch-recruited 33e Regiment d&#x27;Infanterie Legere (33rd Light Infantry Regiment) in Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée.

===Marriages===
Aged 29, on 4 March 1818, Boomgaard married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 – died 24 March 1830). Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, on 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 – 18 May 1864), with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12.

===Longevity===
On 8 January 1897, Boomgaard surpassed the final age of Belgian Pierre Darcourt (108 years and 108 days) to become the oldest man ever, and by 10 April 1898, he was older than the previous titleholder, 109-year-old Norwegian woman Kirsti Skagen (1788–1897), therefore making him the oldest ever verified person at that time.

Boomgaard outlived all of his children: his last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died aged 56 on 24 May 1885.

Boomgaard died aged 110 years and 135 days. The first female supercentenarian and his successor was Margaret Ann Neve — who surpassed Adriaans&#x27; final age, dying at almost 111 (1792–1903) — although his lifespan as the longest-lived male was not surpassed until 29 October 1966 by John Mosely Turner, who died aged 111 years and nine months (1856–1968).&#x27;

<doc id="1190453" wikidata="Q3646538" url="?curid=1190453" title="Llovizna Falls">
<text>Llovizna Falls is a waterfall on the Caroní River, close to its confluence with the Orinoco, located in the Llovizna Park, Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela. The nearby Macagua Dam has reduced the flow over the waterfall in recent years, but the cascade continues to be spectacular and returns to its former glory several times a year when the floodgates of the dam are opened.

&quot;(Llovizna - &quot;yoviz-nah&quot;, is Spanish for mist, drizzle, spray).&quot;
==Activities==
The Llovizna Park is very big, and it has many green areas and benches where family and friends can spend a good time. In the stone theater, located close to the entrance of the park, visitors can enjoy the different shows and plays that locals do to entertain the community and raise the visits of the park. 
Family and friends can also do a picnic. The park has one restaurant that sells the typical plates from the state such as, Arepas, Empanada, Tequeño, and many other things. 
Exercise and training are other activities you can do in the park. The park offers very wide and safe walkaways used by people to ride bicycles, run, jog, or just walk. There are also training machines that are free for visitors.
For the tourists, the park offers a bus tour that takes the visitors to the most special spots of the park such as the Stone Theater, the waterfall, the iron bridge, and many other places.

===Recommendations for Visitors===
It is recommended to wear sports shoes and clothes that would make you feel comfortable in the hot temperature and humidity of the park. There are many rocks and bridges so go prepared for this. Beware of the snakes, do not leave children alone, and check out the places where you stop by. Venezuela is a country with no seasons other than wet and dry, so visitors can go to the park any time of the year.

==Biodiversity of the Park==
With Venezuela being one of the top most biodiverse nations on earth, the park is naturally full of flora and fauna, with many endemic species being found there. One of the most common animals in the park is the tufted capuchin; although these monkeys may appear curious and display a mischievous interest in park visitors, humans are not authorized to touch or feed the monkeys (or any wild animals), as they carry disease and have large, sharp canine teeth, which they are liable to use. Monkeys are notoriously ill-tempered and can become possessive of the most benign of objects (such as food, hats, sunglasses, etc), and will retaliate quickly if they feel offended or manipulated. Feeding them makes the monkeys lose their fear of humans, leading to future potential conflicts and even monkey deaths.

The park is also home to a wide variety of invertebrates, including large spiders, such as the tarantulas &quot;Psalmopoeus irminia&quot; and &quot;Epicadus&quot;. The park also has a wide variety of reptiles and amphibians, including several species of the diminutive poison arrow frogs, considered to be the ‘jewels’ of the forest. These tiny amphibians are so small they must eat tiny insects, notably ants and certain beetles, which produce elements such as formic acid; the frogs are able to retain these compounds in their bodies, effectively rendering them deadly if consumed by a potential predator (captive poison arrow frogs lose this capability due to an altered diet of crickets and fruit flies). Their vivid coloration is a warning signal, in nature, that translates as “poisonous”. The largest and most recognized reptile is likely the green anaconda.

The natural biodiversity of the park is largely due to two the rivers flowing through the area, one of them being the second-longest on the continent (the Orinoco). The park is located in the Guayana natural region.

==Stories and folklore of the Park==
===The Tragedy of the Teachers===
In August 1964, a tragedy happened in the park. The iron chain bridge used to be a wood chain bridge. A group of about 300 teachers from different states of the country met to celebrate the Teachers Convention and they were all excited to see the bridge that has a view to the waterfalls and the Caroní River. When the teachers started to cross the bridge, the bridge could not resist it and it broke. The teachers fell down the rocky river and many of them died because of the many rocks that the river has. Around 50 people died and some of the bodies have not been found yet.

===The Girl Eaten by an Anaconda===
This is the folklore of the park. The people from the city of Ciudad Guayana tell a story of a little girl who was sitting under a tree and an Anaconda that was hanging in the tree ate her. Even though this story is fake, it has made people be more careful with their children. However, there have been Anaconda attacks in the park, and animal control works to keep these snakes out of the park.

<text>Daniel Gregorio &quot;Danny&quot; Romero Jr. (born July 12, 1974) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1992 and 2006. He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the IBF flyweight title from 1995 to 1996 and the IBF junior bantamweight title from 1996 to 1997.

==Professional career==
Romero&#x27;s first fight as a professional was on September 14, 1992, when he knocked out Raul Hernandez in the first round at Phoenix, Arizona. His first eight bouts all took place in the Phoenix area, and he won all, seven by knockout. His first fight outside Phoenix was on April 13, 1993, when he knocked out Alberto Cantu in three rounds at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. On May 22 of that year, he had his first professional fight in his hometown, Albuquerque New Mexico USA, knocking out Silverio Porras in two rounds.

Romero won five more bouts in a row, including a victory over former Alex Sanchez world title challenger Orlando Malone, before having his first chance to fight for a belt: On May 5, 1994, he knocked out Brian Lonon in two rounds to win the NABF regional Flyweight title.
He retained the title four times, and added three non-title victories, before challenging for a world championship for the first time. On April 22, 1995, he became the IBF&#x27;s world Flyweight champion with a twelve round unanimous decision over Francisco Tejedor, at the MGM Grand Arena, in Las Vegas. He defended the title once, then faced the unheralded Willy Salazar in a non-title bout, on September 8. Romero suffered a 7th round TKO loss to Salazar, in what Ring Magazine heralded as the &quot;upset of the year&quot; for 1995. In that fight he was ahead on all score cards before having the fight stopped due to an eye injury. He bounced back with a first round knockout victory over former WBO world Flyweight champion Jose Quirino.

Romero then decided to move up in weight division, to the Super Flyweight division. After one win in that division, he was given a chance at his second world championship. On August 24, 1996, Romero knocked out Colombian Harold Grey in two rounds to conquer his second world title. Even as he had lost to Salazar previously, interest in a fight between Romero and Johnny Tapia began to increase.

After winning two more fights, both times Romero retaining his world title by knockout, Romero and Tapia met to unify the IBF and WBO world Super Flyweight championships. On July 18, 1997, the long-awaited bout finally took place, with Tapia winning a close twelve round unanimous decision.

Romero won three fights in a row, then lost, on Halloween night, 1998 to Vuyani Bungu by a twelve round decision in an attempt to win a title in a third division, this time the IBF Super-Bantamweight title.

Romero would go on to win ten of his next twelve bouts, including a first round knockout over former world champion Rodolfo Blanco and a sixth round knockout over the respected Famosito Gomez. On September 27, 2002, Danny fought Cruz Carbajal but the fight was stopped by Romero&#x27;s trainer, former world champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammad after round four due to an injury suffered in the first round.

On May 23, 2003, in front of his hometown crowd following a twelve round unanimous decision win over Trinidad Mendoza gave him his third world title in three different weight classes, winning the IBA&#x27;s Super-Bantamweight title.

==Other achievements==
Romero does occasional television jobs, specifically for the Showtime boxing network as well as commercials and movies.
Developed his own promotional company called &quot;Danny Romero Productions.&quot; The company promotes shows of any kind and currently has professional fighters signed to the company. A private boxing gym was purchased to provide his fighters with elite training. The gym prepares Danny as well as his pro fighters for possible upcoming events.

==Comeback==
Romero Jr.&#x27;s father was stricken with a rare liver disorder, a form of cirrhosis that would kill him without a transplant. Inspired by his father&#x27;s battle, Romero Jr. returned to the ring and, fighting for the first time in two years, was held to a majority draw by Alex Ali Baba (21-7-1) in an eight-round junior featherweight fight.

<text>Mark Grigorievich Krein (, ; 3 April 1907 – 17 October 1989) was a Soviet mathematician, one of the major figures of the Soviet school of functional analysis. He is known for works in operator theory (in close connection with concrete problems coming from mathematical physics), the problem of moments, classical analysis and representation theory.

He was born in Kyiv, leaving home at age 17 to go to Odesa. He had a difficult academic career, not completing his first degree and constantly being troubled by anti-Semitic discrimination. His supervisor was Nikolai Chebotaryov.

He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1982 (jointly with Hassler Whitney),
but was not allowed to attend the ceremony.

David Milman, Mark Naimark, Israel Gohberg, Vadym Adamyan, Mikhail Livsic and other known mathematicians were his students.

He died in Odesa.

On 14 January 2008, the memorial plaque of Mark Krein was unveiled on the main administration building of I.I. Mechnikov Odesa National University.

<text>was a retainer of the Shimazu clan during the Edo period. He served under Shimazu Yoshihisa. On 1568, he became a Karō for his services.

He was known as a skilled commander in battle. On 1578, Ōtomo Yoshishige attacked the Shimazu clan and Arinobu gathered 500 troops to hold ground at Takajo Castle. In the Battle of Mimigawa that followed, the Shimazu army defeated the Otomo who retreated under heavy losses. The Otomo losses included commanders like Kamachi Akimori, from which it never recovered.

In 1585, he fought in the attack of Horikiri castle at Chikugo Province and later in the Siege of Iwaya Castle resulted after the Shimazu invasion of Chikuzen Province.

In 1587, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched the invasion of Kyūshū at Shimazu clan territory, Arinobu again gathered a handful of troops to take a defensive stand after the main body of the army led by Shimazu Yoshihisa had lost. Refusing to surrender to Toyotomi&#x27;s troops, Arinobu surrendered only after Yoshihisa ordered him to surrender and offered Toyotomi his son Yamada Arinaga as hostage.

Yamada died in 1609 and it is said that Yoshihisa prayed in front of his coffin, thanking him for his long service.

<text>Enterovirus is a genus of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses associated with several human and mammalian diseases. Enteroviruses are named by their transmission-route through the intestine (&#x27;enteric&#x27; meaning intestinal).

Serologic studies have distinguished 71 human enterovirus serotypes on the basis of antibody neutralization tests. Additional antigenic variants have been defined within several of the serotypes on the basis of reduced or nonreciprocal cross-neutralization between variant strains. On the basis of their pathogenesis in humans and animals, the enteroviruses were originally classified into four groups, polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses (CA), Coxsackie B viruses (CB), and echoviruses, but it was quickly realized that there were significant overlaps in the biological properties of viruses in the different groups. Enteroviruses isolated more recently are named with a system of consecutive numbers: EV-D68, EV-B69, EV-D70, EV-A71, etc., where genotyping is based on the VP1 capsid region.

Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year and are often found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) and stool of an infected person. Historically, poliomyelitis was the most significant disease caused by an enterovirus, namely poliovirus. There are 81 non-polio and 3 polio enteroviruses that can cause disease in humans. Of the 81 non-polio types, there are 22 Coxsackie A viruses, 6 Coxsackie B viruses, 28 echoviruses, and 25 other enteroviruses.

Poliovirus, as well as coxsackie and echovirus, is spread through the fecal–oral route. Infection can result in a wide variety of symptoms, including those of: mild respiratory illness (the common cold), hand, foot and mouth disease, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, acute flaccid paralysis, and the related acute flaccid myelitis.

== Virology ==

Enteroviruses are members of the picornavirus family, a large and diverse group of small RNA viruses characterized by a single positive-strand genomic RNA. All enteroviruses contain a genome of approximately 7,500 bases and are known to have a high mutation rate due to low-fidelity replication and frequent recombination. After infection of the host cell, the genome is translated in a cap-independent manner into a single polyprotein, which is subsequently processed by virus-encoded proteases into the structural capsid proteins and the nonstructural proteins, which are mainly involved in the replication of the virus.

RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in the evolution of enteroviruses as well as in the shaping of their genetic architecture. The mechanism of recombination of the RNA genome likely involves template strand switching during RNA replication, a process known as copy choice recombination. RNA recombination is considered to be an adaptation for dealing with RNA genome damage and a source of genetic diversity. It is also a source of concern for vaccination strategies, because live attenuated/mutated strains used for vaccination could potentially recombine with wild-type related strains, as has been the case with circulating vaccine derived polio viruses (cVDPDs). The capsid region and especially VP1 is a recombination coldspot, and this is one of the main reasons to use this region for genotyping. However, the 5&#x27;UTR - capsid junction and the beginning of the P2 region have been observed to recombine very frequently, although recombinations do occur in the rest of the genome as well. Interestingly, the enterovirus species EV-A, EV-B, EV-C, EV-D have not been observed so far to exchange genomic regions among them, with the exception of the 5&#x27;UTR.

== Member viruses ==
===Enterovirus A–L===
Enteroviruses are a group of ubiquitous viruses that cause a number of infections which are usually mild. The genus enterovirus includes enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.

Enterovirus A include coxsackievirus A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A12, A14, A16 and enterovirus A71, A76, A89, A90, A91, A92, A144, A119, A120, A121, A122 (simian virus 19), A123 (simian virus 43), A124 (simian virus 46), A125 (baboon enterovirus A13). Some viruses initially reported as novel have been found to be misidentified. Thus, coxsackievirus A23 is the same serotype as echovirus 9, and coxsackievirus A15 is the same serotype as coxsackievirus A11 and coxsackievirus A18 is the same serotype as coxsackievirus A13.

Coxsackie A16 virus causes human hand, foot and mouth disease.

Enterovirus B includes coxsackievirus B1,2,3,4,5,6; coxsackievirus A9; echovirus 1–33 and enterovirus B69–113. Coxsackie B viruses are found worldwide and can cause myocarditis (inflammation of the heart); pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart); meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that line the brain and spinal cord); and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). The Coxsackie B viruses are also reported to cause a spastic paralysis due to the degeneration of neuronal tissue and muscle injury. Infections usually occur during warm summer months with symptoms including exanthema, pleurodynia, flu-like illness consisting of fever, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Echoviruses are a cause of many of the nonspecific viral infections that can range from minor illness to severe, potentially fatal conditions such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis and myocarditis. It is mainly found in the intestine, and can cause nervous disorders. Type B enteroviruses are responsible for a vast number of mild and acute infections. They have been reported to remain in the body causing persistent infections contributing to chronic diseases such as type I diabetes.

Enterovirus C consists of polioviruses 1,2 and 3; coxsackieviruses A1, A11, A13, A18, A17, 20, A21, A22, A24 and enterovirus C95, C96, C99, C102, C104, C105, C109, C113, C118. The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 each have a slightly different capsid protein. Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. PV-1 is the most common type to cause infection in humans; however, all three forms are extremely contagious spreading through person-to-person contact. Poliovirus causes Polio, or Poliomyelitis, which is a disabling and life-threatening disease that causes paresthesia, meningitis and permanent paralysis. Symptoms can include sore throat, fever, tiredness, nausea, headache and stomach pain although 72% of those that get infected will not display visible symptoms. There are two types of vaccines available to prevent polio: inactivated poliovirus vaccine given as an injection in the leg (IPV) or arm and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The polio vaccine is highly efficacious giving protection to 99 out of 100 children vaccinated.

=== Persistent non-cytolytic enterovirus ===
Enteroviruses are capable of producing acute infections that are rapidly cleared by the adaptive immune response. However, genomic mutations which enterovirus B serotypes (such as coxsackievirus B and echovirus) may acquire in the host during the acute phase of the infection can transform these viruses into the non-cytolytic form (also known as non-cytopathic or defective enterovirus), a form which is capable of causing persistent low-level infections in human tissues that can last indefinitely.

This persistent non-cytolytic enterovirus is a mutated quasispecies, and such non-cytolytic infections have been found in the pancreas in type 1 diabetes, in chronic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, in valvular heart disease, in the muscles, intestines and brain in myalgic encephalomyelitis, and in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. In these persistent infections, enteroviral RNA is present at low levels in the tissues (both as single-stranded viral RNA, and in the more immune resistant doubled-stranded RNA form). Some researchers believe this enteroviral RNA is just a remnant of the acute infection, although other scientists believe these persistent intracellular viral RNA infections may have pathological effects, playing a causal role their associated diseases.

===Enterovirus D68===

EV-D68 first was identified in California in 1962. Compared with other enteroviruses, it has been rarely reported in the U.S. in the past 40 years. Most people who get infected are infants, children, and teens. EV-D68 usually causes mild to severe respiratory illness; however, the full spectrum of EV-D68 illness is not well-defined. Most start with common cold symptoms of runny nose and cough. Some, but not all, may also have fever. For more severe cases, difficulty breathing, wheezing or problems catching your breath may occur. As of October 4, 2014, there has been one death in New Jersey directly linked to EV-D68, as well as one death in Rhode Island attributed to a combination of EV-D68 and sepsis caused by an infection of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

===Enterovirus A71===

Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is notable as one of the major causative agents for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and is sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases. EV-A71 was first isolated and characterized from cases of neurological disease in California in 1969. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of host response to EV-A71 infection, but increases in the level of mRNAs encoding chemokines, proteins involved in protein degradation, complement proteins, and proapoptotis proteins have been implicated.

===Poliovirus===

There are three serotypes of poliovirus, &quot;PV-1&quot;, &quot;PV-2&quot;, and &quot;PV-3&quot;; each with a slightly different capsid protein. Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. &quot;PV-1&quot; is the most common form encountered in nature; however, all three forms are extremely infectious. Poliovirus can affect the spinal cord and cause poliomyelitis.

&quot;Polioviruses&quot; were formerly classified as a species belonging to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. The Poliovirus species has been eliminated from the genus Enterovirus. The following serotypes, Human poliovirus 1, Human poliovirus 2, and Human poliovirus 3, were assigned to the species Human enterovirus C, in the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. The type species of the genus Enterovirus was changed from Poliovirus to Human enterovirus C. This has been ratified in April 2008. The 39th Executive Committee (EC39) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) met in Canada during June 2007 with new taxonomic proposals.

Two of the proposals with three changes were:
* Code 2005.261V.04: To remove the following species Poliovirus from the existing genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae.
* Code 2005.262V.04: To assign the viruses; PV-1, PV-2, PV-3 to the existing species Human enterovirus C in the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae.
* Code 2005.263V.04: To change the type species Poliovirus from the existing genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae to the type species Human enterovirus C.
Proposals approved at the (EC39) meeting of 2007, were sent to members of ICTV via email for ratification and have become official taxonomy. There have been a total of 215 taxonomic proposals, which have been approved and ratified since the 8th ICTV Report of 2005.

The ratification process was performed by email. The proposals were sent electronically via email on March 18, 2008, to ICTV members with a request to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals, with a 1-month deadline.
The following are two of the taxonomic proposals with three changes that were ratified by ICTV members in April 2008:

Picornaviruses
* 2005.261V.04: To remove the following species from the existing genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae: Poliovirus. (Note: Poliovirus hereby loses its status as a virus species.)
* 2005.262V.04: To assign the following viruses to the species Human enterovirus C in the existing genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae: Human poliovirus 1, Human poliovirus 2, Human poliovirus 3. (This is not strictly necessary as a taxonomic proposal because it concerns entities below the species level, but it is left in to clarify this reorganization of the Picornaviridae.)
* 2005.263V.04: To change the type species of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae, from Poliovirus to Human enterovirus C.

==Diseases caused by enterovirus infection==

Enteroviruses cause a wide range of symptoms, and while their long list of signs and symptoms should put them on the differential diagnosis list of many illnesses, they often go unnoticed. Enteroviruses can cause anything from rashes in small children, to summer colds, to encephalitis, to blurred vision, to pericarditis. Enteroviral infections have a great range in presentation and seriousness. Non polio enteroviruses cause 10–15 million infections and tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the US each year. Enteroviruses can be identified through cell culture or PCR assay, collected from fecal or respiratory specimens. Below are common enterovirus related diseases, including poliomyelitis.
* Poliomyelitis primarily via the fecal-oral route
* Polio-like syndrome found in children who tested positive for enterovirus 68.
* Nonspecific febrile illness is the most common presentation of enterovirus infection. Other than fever, symptoms include muscle pain, sore throat, gastrointestinal distress/abdominal discomfort, and headache. In newborns the picture may be that of sepsis, however, and can be severe and life-threatening.
* Enteroviruses are by far the most common causes of aseptic meningitis in children. In the United States, enteroviruses are responsible for 30,000 to 50,000 meningitis hospitalizations per year as a result of 10–15 million infections.
* Bornholm disease or epidemic pleurodynia is characterized by severe paroxysmal pain in the chest and abdomen, along with fever, and sometimes nausea, headache, and emesis.
* Pericarditis and/or myocarditis are typically caused by enteroviruses; symptoms consist of fever with dyspnea and chest pain. Arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction have also been reported.
* Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis can be caused by enteroviruses.
* Herpangina is caused by Coxsackie A virus, and causes a vesicular rash in the oral cavity and on the pharynx, along with high fever, sore throat, malaise, and often dysphagia, loss of appetite, back pain, and headache. It is also self-limiting, with symptoms typically ending in 3–4 days.
* Hand, foot and mouth disease is a childhood illness most commonly caused by infection by Coxsackie A virus or EV71.
* Encephalitis is rare manifestation of enterovirus infection; when it occurs, the most frequent enterovirus found to be causing it is echovirus 9.
* Myocarditis is characterized by inflammation of the myocardium (cardiac muscle cells). Over the last couple of decades, numerous culprits have been identified as playing a role in myocarditis pathogenesis in addition to the enterovirus, which at first was the most commonly implicated virus in this pathology. One of the most common enteroviruses found to be responsible for causing Myocarditis is the Coxsackie B3 virus.
* A 2007 study suggested that acute respiratory or gastrointestinal infections associated with enterovirus may be a factor in myalgic encephalomyelitis.

===Suspected diseases===

Encephalitis lethargica, the 1917–1926 &quot;sleeping sickness&quot;.

===Possible correlations being studied===
Enterovirus has been speculated to be connected with Type 1 diabetes. It has been proposed that type 1 diabetes is a virus-triggered autoimmune response in which the immune system attacks virus-infected cells along with the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. A team working at University of Tampere, Finland identified the enterovirus Coxsackievirus B1 as possibly linked to type 1 diabetes (which is an autoimmune disease).

Enteroviruses, including polioviruses, may be a cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

==Symptoms==
Most people who contract enterovirus have mild symptoms lasting about a week. Those with higher risk may have more complications, sometimes becoming fatal. The most common sign of enterovirus is a common cold. More intense symptoms of enterovirus include hypoxia, aseptic meningitis, conjunctivitis, hand, foot and mouth disease, and paralysis.

==Treatment==
Treatment for enteroviral infection is mainly supportive. In cases of pleurodynia, treatment consists of analgesics to relieve the severe pain that occurs in patients with the disease; in some severe cases, opiates may be needed. Treatment for aseptic meningitis caused by enteroviruses is also mainly symptomatic. In patients with enteroviral carditis, treatment consists of the prevention and treatment of complications such as arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, and cardiac failure. Other treatments that have been investigated for enteroviral carditis include intravenous immunoglobulin.

<doc id="1190489" wikidata="Q2266049" url="?curid=1190489" title="Ang Mo Kio MRT station">
<text>Ang Mo Kio MRT station is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the North South Line in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore.

Located at the junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8, beside Ang Mo Kio Town Garden East, the station is connected to AMK Hub, Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange and the Ang Mo Kio Town Centre via an underground walkway.

Opened on 7 November 1987, Ang Mo Kio station is one of the five stations that collectively make up Singapore&#x27;s oldest MRT stations. This station will become an interchange station along the Cross Island Line in 2030.

==History==
In July 1983, the Provisional Mass Transit Authority has extended the line to Yio Chu Kang, and the Phase 1A extended from Outram Park via Tiong Bahru, Redhill, Queenstown, Commonwealth, Buona Vista and Clementi stations, easing the loads at Ang Mo Kio.

On 12 June 1984, the contract was shortlisted for the construction of a viaduct from San Teng MRT station to Yio Chu Kang, together with Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang stations under Contract 102. This contract also specified that the stretch of Ang Mo Kio Street 53 all the way to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 would have to be permanently closed in 1985 and levelled, so that the railway could be laid on the ground level.

Ang Mo Kio was the second station on the North South line to receive MJ Air Tech high-volume low-speed fans. The fans were placed into service on 30 June 2012, along with those installed at Jurong East.

Installation of noise barriers from Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 is completed.

===Cross Island Line Interchange===
On 25 January 2019, LTA announced that Ang Mo Kio station would be part of the proposed Cross Island line (CRL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 1, consisting of 12 stations between Aviation Park and Bright Hill, and is expected to be completed in 2030. A second phase from Bright Hill to Jurong Lake District is targeted to open in 2032.

A contract for the design and construction of Ang Mo Kio CRL Station and associated tunnels was awarded to Gammon Construction and Engineering Pte. Ltd – Bachy Soletanche Singapore Pte. Ltd. Joint Venture on 20 July 2021 at a sum of S$644 million. Construction will start in the fourth quarter of 2021, with completion in 2030.

Initially expected to open in 2029, the restrictions on the construction due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to delays in the CRL line completion, and the date was pushed to 2030.

==Incidents==
Nitcharee Peneakchansak, a 14-year-old Thai, was seriously injured and lost both her legs after she fell onto the track and was hit by a train at Ang Mo Kio on 3 April 2011. Peneakchansak left Singapore on 13 June that year after recuperating in hospital. SMRT had reportedly offered the family S$5000 as compensation. The victim&#x27;s father, rejected the compensation as her prosthetic legs will cost around S$100,000 and must be changed every three to five years. Her father sued SMRT for S$3.4 million the amount equivalent to the price for the 20 pairs of prosthetic legs that Peneakchansak will need in her lifetime.

On 20 June 2011, SMRT clarified that the money offered to Peneakchansak was a gesture of goodwill and not compensation. The transport company said compensation would only be made after investigations had concluded. SMRT also said that the S$10,000 offered to her family to travel to Singapore when she was still in hospital was also a gesture of goodwill. In its defence papers on 1 September that year, the SMRT reiterates that all the safety warnings and precautions – such as the yellow lines – were in place and that the distance which the train travelled after the driver slammed on the brakes were within &quot;safety specifications&quot; and argues that Peneakchansak&#x27;s &quot;negligence&quot; contributed to her falling &quot;onto the tracks at the MRT station on her own accord&quot;. It also claimed that the girl was &quot;aware of the danger of the oncoming trains and that by standing behind the yellow safety line until the train had stopped&quot;, she would have been reasonably safe from falling onto the tracks and pointed out that the girl had failed to keep a proper lookout for the oncoming train and take reasonable care of her own well-being despite knowing the risks of falling. It adds that she had failed to stand behind the yellow safety line until the train had stopped despite clear warning signs displayed at the MRT station.

Ang Hin Kee, MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC announced that Ang Mo Kio station would be installed with the half-height platform screen doors on the platform by June, earlier than scheduled. Although it was announced to be completed by that month, it was delayed till 2 December that year before operations began.

<text>Sharrow is a suburb of Sheffield located directly southwest of Sheffield city centre. The district lies within the Nether Edge and Sharrow ward of the city.

Sharrow Ward&#x27;s back to back terraced housing in &quot;Little Sheffield&quot; was redeveloped in the 1970s to provide modern, high density accommodation for the area&#x27;s working class population. 

With the economic resurgence of Sheffield in the late 1990s, Sharrow has benefited from considerable inward investment both in improved housing stock and through development of local initiatives such as the small business enterprise unit at Sheffield United F.C.&#x27;s Bramall Lane ground in nearby Highfield.

Until June 2004 Sharrow was also the name given to one of Sheffield&#x27;s electoral wards which included Sharrow proper and a number of surrounding districts. This diverse ward contained 17,897 people in the 2001 UK Census subdivided as follows:

* White: 69.0%
* Asian: 16.3%
* Black: 7.5%
* Chinese or other: 4.2%
* Mixed: 3.0%

This diversity is celebrated by some with the Sharrow Festival, a multi-cultural, multi-arts event showcasing local talent and fostering a spirit of pride in the local community. The annual Sharrow Lantern Carnival is the other cultural highlight in the area, and is held in April.

==History==
Sharrow was urbanized between 1830 and 1850 when &quot;Little Sheffield&quot;, a village and adjunct to the main town of Sheffield was redeveloped to cope with the rapidly increasing growth in population. Separated from Sheffield town by the &quot;uninhabited, barren, gorse-covered, Sheffield Moor&quot;. Industry here was based on water-power provided by Porter Brook with water-wheels at Sharrow Mill (Sharrow Vale Road), Sharrow Forge (Napier Street), and Bennetts’ Wheel (Vulcan Works). The latter two mill-dams and Broomhall Cornmill dam off Ecclesall Road were drained and filled-in around 1870 providing land for houses, schools, and new industries.

The Parish Church of St Mary&#x27;s, Bramall Lane, was built in 1826 with the help of a government grant to provide churches for &quot;impoverished industrial workers&quot;. Originally a Chapel of Ease to Sheffield Cathedral standing in open fields, 22 years later, in 1848, St Mary&#x27;s became a parish in its own right. Sharrow and St Mary&#x27;s was part of Poor Law Union (PLU)/Reg. District of Ecclesall Bierlow.

In 1836 the General Cemetery was opened in Sharrow on the site of a former stone quarry. Lying between Cemetery Road, which runs from Sharrow Head to the bottom of The Moor, and Sharrow Brook.

Bramall Lane was named after the Bramall family, file and graver manufacturers. The Bramalls owned &quot;The Old White House&quot; on the corner of Bramall Lane and Cherry Street.

<doc id="1190502" wikidata="Q1906213" url="?curid=1190502" title="Bukit Batok">
<text>Bukit Batok ( ), often abbreviated as Bt Batok, is a planning area and matured residential town located along the eastern boundary of the West Region of Singapore. Bukit Batok statistically ranks in as the 25th largest, the 10th most populous and the 9th most densely populated planning area in Singapore. It is bordered by six other planning areas - Choa Chu Kang to the north, northeast and northwest, Cashew to the northeast and east, Clementi to the south, Bukit Timah to the southeast, Jurong East to the southwest and Tengah to the west.

Bukit Batok largely sits on Gombak norite, a geological formation that is found in high concentrations within the planning area itself, as well as in the western parts of neighbouring Cashew. It was this presence of the igneous rock that made Bukit Batok a pivotal location for the quarrying industry in Singapore around the turn of the mid-20th century.

==Etymology==
Many differing accounts describe the origin of the name Bukit Batok. &quot;Bukit&quot; means &quot;hill&quot; in Malay, thus the name of the town gives the impression of it being hilly. &quot;Batok&quot;, however, has several interpretations.

One version, according to a Javanese village chief of the village Gassing, that coconut trees grew in the hilly area and hence the area was named &quot;batok&quot;, the Javanese term for coconuts.

The Chinese version is that the hills of solid granite, which is called &quot;batu&quot; in Malay, and then subsequently misnamed as &quot;bato&quot; and then finally &quot;batok&quot;. Another version was that hill looks like a human skull top and the words skull top was pronounced as &quot;batok&quot;.

Others believe that &quot;batok&quot;, the Malay word for cough, is linked to the place either because of its cool air (causing coughs and colds), or due to the sound of explosives historically used at its granite quarry, Little Guilin.

== History ==
Before the 1940s, Bukit Batok was heavily dominated by rubber and pineapple plantations. At the start of the 1940s, industrialization began to gradually occur in Bukit Timah. Ford factory was one of the first factories to be built along Bukit Timah road near the current day&#x27;s site.

During the battle of Singapore in the World War II, Bukit Batok became a significant ground for both the Allied and Axis powers. The failed attempt by the British to defend the vicinity during the Battle of Bukit Timah and their subsequent surrender on 15 February 1942 to the Japanese at the Ford Motor Factory was described by Winston Churchill as the &quot;largest capitulation&quot; in British military history.

Consequently, the British&#x27;s plans to industrialize Bukit Timah was short-lived and put to an abrupt halt during World War II. The factories that were built before 1942 were swiftly taken over by the Japanese during their occupation of Singapore. Ford Factory, which sits at the bottom of the Bukit Batok Hill, was occupied by Nissan, the Japanese Multination Corporation, to supply military vehicles for the Imperial Japanese Army Force. Both Bukit Batok hill (current day Bukit Batok Nature Park) and Bukit Timah hill were considered as strategic hill grounds during the Japanese occupation. These locations were key to controlling the surrounding areas and thus were the site of the fiercest battles of the war.

Following the successful conquest of Singapore, General Yamashita ordered 500 Australian prisoners of war to construct a Japanese war memorial, Syonan Chureito shrine, at the top of Bukit Batok Hill. Throughout the Japanese occupation, the Japanese officials and military personnel would frequently worship their emperor in the Syonan Chureito shrine. In addition, footages of these ceremonies would be broadcast as propaganda in Japan to ensure the citizens’ continuous support for the war. However, the shrine was ultimately destroyed by the Japanese themselves at the end of the World War II as they feared that the honour of the memorial would be tarnished by the returning British troops.

After World War II, the British returned to Singapore. The areas around Ford Factory became known as the British&#x27;s ‘colonial estate factories’ as the British resumed their plans to industrialize Bukit Batok. In addition to the development of factories, Bukit Batok began to be extensively quarried for granite. The Poh Kim Quarry, which lies in the heart of Bukit Batok Nature Park today, was one of the quarry sites in the vicinity. It was quarried for granite between the 1950s to the 1970s but was later abandoned due to the damage that the activities was causing to the Earth&#x27;s core.

After Singapore gained independence in 1965, the newly formed People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) government aggressively promoted the site as a lightweight industrial area. 
Development of Bukit Batok New Town began in December 1975, transforming the former village into a new town in the rough span of a decade. As a testament to its heritage, several norite formations and ridges remained preserved, most of which can be found at both Bukit Batok Nature Park and Bukit Batok Town Park as a characteristic feature of the modern-day town.

<doc id="1190506" wikidata="Q8014990" url="?curid=1190506" title="William Mackenzie, 1st Baron Amulree">
<text>William Warrender Mackenzie, 1st Baron Amulree (19 August 1860 – 5 May 1942), known as Sir William Mackenzie between 1918 and 1929, was a British barrister, public servant and Labour (later National Labour) politician. He served as Secretary of State for Air under Ramsay MacDonald between 1930 and 1931.

He later chaired the Newfoundland Royal Commission, which reported on the future governance of the Dominion of Newfoundland.

==Early life==
Amulree was the son of Robert (Robin) Mackenzie, of Scone, Perthshire, and Jean, daughter of Basil Menzies. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and was called to the Bar from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1886.

==Public career==
Mackenzie published &quot;The Overseer&#x27;s Handbook&quot; in 1889 and became a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1914. In 1918 he became Chairman of the Committee on Production, a position he held until 1919. He was then President of the Industrial Court between 1919 and 1926 and Chairman of the National Wages Board for Railways between 1920 and 1926, of the Industrial Delegation to Canada and the USA between 1926 and 1927, and of the Departmental Committee on the Shop Hours Act 1927. He was promoted within the Order of the British Empire to be a Knight Grand Cross (GBE).

==Political career==
In 1929 Mackenzie was raised to the peerage as Baron Amulree, of Strathbraan in the County of Perth, giving him a seat in the House of Lords and the possibility of joining the government. In October 1930, he was appointed as Secretary of State for Air in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s second Labour government, succeeding the deceased Lord Thomson, with a seat in the cabinet, and at the same time was sworn into the Privy Council. He was one of the few Labour politicians to follow MacDonald into the coalition National Government, in which he kept his post, although not his seat on the Cabinet, until the reconstruction of the government after the November 1931 general election.

In 1933, Amulree chaired the Newfoundland Royal Commission, which prepared a report on the future of Newfoundland as a dominion of the British Empire.

==Personal life==
Amulree married Lilian, daughter of William Hardwck Bradbury, in 1897. She died at Cheam, Surrey, in June 1916. Amulree died in May 1942, aged 81, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Basil, who became a distinguished physician.

==Honours==
In 1917 Amulree was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and in 1918 promoted in the same Order to a Knight Commander (KBE), making him Sir William Mackenzie.

* Fajar
* Segar
* Jelapang
* Senja


The driverless and fully automated Bukit Panjang LRT line was completed on 11 June 1999 at a cost of S$285 million. The rail line was intended to serve the growing town and act as a replacement to the many buses employed through the town, especially during rush hours. Originally opening with 14 stations, Ten Mile Junction station permanently closed in 2019 after sighting low ridership, bringing the number to 13.

Several petitions were presented by the residents of Bukit Panjang protesting the decision by SMRT to replace the buses in Bukit Panjang with the LRT system. Some of the complaints were related to the fact that people preferred the previous bus system that covered most parts of the Bukit Panjang neighbourhoods such as bus service 190 and 972. The previous bus system was viewed as more efficient because it had many bus stops within walking distance; the LRT system has only 13 stations that are spaced hundreds of meters apart.

The LRT system is expected to go through a major upgrading programme that is due to be completed by 2026. The programme will bring about a new signalling system, better condition monitoring, new power rails system and 19 new light rail vehicles.

===Bus===
The public bus system is predominantly run by SMRT Buses. Of the SMRT buses based in Bukit Panjang, some are smaller feeder bus services that serve the various areas of the neighbourhood, while the rest are long-distance trunk services that serve as a mode of transport to other towns and to the city centre. Bus services start and end at Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange.

===Road===

Bukit Panjang is bounded by two of Singapore&#x27;s expressways — the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) and Kranji Expressway (KJE). The BKE is accessible via Bukit Panjang Road and Dairy Farm Road, while the KJE is accessible via Woodlands Road and Senja Road.

Bukit Panjang also has a ring road running through the various parts of Bukit Panjang, the Bukit Panjang Ring Road. It acts as a feeder to the main arterial roads in the town.

=== Cycling ===

There is a total of 8.5 km-worth of cycling paths around Bukit Panjang to facilitate active mobility as part of the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s Walk-Cycle-Ride initiative. The first batch of cycling paths was constructed along Petir Road in 2018 by the Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council. The network has since expanded to cover areas such as Fajar, Bangkit, Jelapang, and Senja. Together with the Pang Sua Park Connector, Bukit Panjang Park Connector, and Bukit Panjang (Woodlands Road to KJE) Park Connector, the cycling paths form the backbone of the town&#x27;s 16 km cycling network.

== Politics ==
Bukit Panjang is politically divided into two constituencies, namely the Bukit Panjang Single Member Constituency and the Cashew and Zhenghua wards of the Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency.

Bukit Panjang SMC mainly consists of the Pending, Bangkit and Fajar areas. Its Member of Parliament is Liang Eng Hwa.

<text>Hougang () is a planning area and mature residential town located in the North-East Region of Singapore. It is the largest housing estate in Singapore based on land area, and is home to 247,528 residents as of 2018. Hougang planning area is bordered by Sengkang to the north, Geylang to the south, Bedok to the southeast, Toa Payoh to the southwest, Serangoon to the west and Paya Lebar to the east.

==Geography==
Subzones

Hougang is separated into 10 subzones, Hougang East, Defu Industrial Park, Tai Seng, Lorong Halus, Kangkar, Hougang West, Trafalgar, Lorong Ah Soo, Kovan and Hougang Central.

==Etymology and history==
Hougang is located upstream or at the back of Sungei Serangoon. The area just beyond the seventh milestone along Punggol Road was formerly considered part of Punggol but is now within Hougang Town and that section of Punggol Road is now Hougang Avenue 8, with Punggol Road starting further north.

Pig farming was carried out in Punggol, including the area of Punggol that is now part of Hougang Town. The last of these pig farmers were relocated by the late-1990s to flats built in Hougang.

There was also a fishing port at the end of Upper Serangoon Road beyond the seventh milestone.

The development of Hougang commenced in 1977 with the construction of Tampines Way. Further construction work was subsequently completed in Neighbourhoods 1 – 3 by 1983, and later Neighbourhoods 4 – 7 by 1992. Neighbourhood 8 is the town centre of Hougang and construction was completed in 1994. Neighbourhood 9 is the most recent with a completion date in 2000.

In 2015, a project named Hougang Capeview, a Build-To-Order project at Upper Serangoon Road, became the first public housing project to receive the CONQUAS Star, an accolade administered by the Building and Construction Authority. Hougang Capeview, which comprises 781 residential units in six blocks at Upper Serangoon Road, received a Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) score of more than 95, above the national average of 88.2. The CONQUAS score is BCA&#x27;s measure of construction quality across Singapore.

The town is also linked to other towns by Yio Chu Kang Road in the West, Tampines Road in the East, Upper Paya Lebar Road to the south-East, Buangkok Drive &amp; Buangkok Green in the North.

Other roads in Hougang New Town links the town to bigger roads, most importantly Avenue 2, 3 which links the town from East and West.

==Amenities==
Most of Hougang&#x27;s commercial activity is centred on a few shopping malls such as Hougang Mall, Kang Kar Mall, Heartland Mall, Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, Hougang Rivercourt Shopping Centre (that opened in May 2022), and Hougang 1 (Formerly known as Hougang Point, and opened in End 1999).

Similar to most other residential towns in Singapore, Hougang was designed to be a partially self-sufficient with enough amenities to minimize the number of residents commuting to the Central Area. Facilities include Hougang Sports Hall, an indoor sports complex operated by Sport Singapore which runs ClubFITT membership and sports programmes, Hougang stadium home to S.League club Hougang United, an aquatics centre, a number of parks such as Punggol Park, along with many wet markets and hawker centres.

One of the more prominent landmarks in Hougang is the Buangkok Green Medical Park, which houses several medical facilities including the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and Singapore Leprosy Relief Association (SILRA).

The Hougang Central Bus Interchange serves Hougang Town with a range of bus services going to other parts of the island. It is located in Hougang Central, near Hougang Mall and it has an underground link to Hougang MRT station. This bus interchange was officially opened on 17 December 1994 by former cabinet minister Goh Chee Wee, who was then Senior Minister of State for Communications, Trade and Industry to serve all buses around the Hougang Area. Its sister bus interchange, Hougang South Bus Interchange (that is near to Kovan MRT station) ceased operations in 2004 and was converted to Kovan Hub.

Two even older bus terminals operated in Hougang before the construction of the Hougang Central and Hougang South Bus Interchanges. One was at the end of Upper Serangoon Road in Kangkar Village, which was replaced by Hougang Central, while the other was at the sixth and a half milestone of Upper Serangoon Road, which was replaced by Hougang South.

==Highlights==

A distinctive feature of Hougang lies in the large semi-circular balconies which occur in many Housing and Development Board public housing flats in the area. This feature is not as prevalent in public housing outside Hougang. The latest addition of new Condominium will be Florence Residences in 2019.

==Politics==
The political representation of Hougang was split into four different constituencies as of the 2020 elections, three of which were Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) (Aljunied, Ang Mo Kio, and Marine Parade), and one Single Member Constituency (SMC) bearing the same name, the Hougang Single Member Constituency. Currently, Aljunied and Hougang wards are managed by the opposition Workers&#x27; Party (WP), while Ang Mo Kio and Marine Parade are managed by the ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP). Previously, Hougang was administered by five now-defunct wards (Jalan Kayu, Paya Lebar, Punggol, Serangoon Gardens and Upper Serangoon), before it redistricted into GRCs, notably Cheng San GRC (also defunct since 2001).

=== Hougang SMC ===

The area covering Hougang Avenues 2, 5, 7 and a small portion of Hougang Central, falls under the namesake Hougang SMC, where it was carved out from Punggol ward ahead of the 1988 elections. The first Member of Parliament (MP) of the ward was PAP&#x27;s Tang Guan Seng, until it had been captured by former WP secretary-general Low Thia Khiang in 1991. Low left the ward to contest (and later elect himself in) Aljunied GRC ahead of the 2011 elections, and was replaced by Yaw Shin Leong, another WP candidate who previously contested Ang Mo Kio GRC in the 2006 elections. Yaw remained as an MP until his expulsion from the party&#x27;s CEC and resigned his seat in February 2012 over an extramarital affair. Png Eng Huat, a candidate whose part of the WP team contested East Coast GRC in the 2011 elections, had since represented this ward after winning his by-election in May 2012 until he stepped down ahead of the 2020 election. Dennis Tan, who previously contested Fengshan SMC in the 2015 elections (now part of East Coast GRC) and become a Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP), has replaced outgoing Png following the election.

=== Aljunied GRC ===

The area covering south of Hougang Avenues 6, 8, 10, as well as Punggol Park, Defu Industrial Park and the subregion of Kovan, falls under Aljunied GRC. The western portions of Hougang, previously being Serangoon Gardens division, were split into two divisions with Jalan Kayu in the Ang Mo Kio GRC and Serangoon in the Aljunied GRC. The area was previously belong to the short-lived Thomson GRC in 1991.

The GRC was not contested in 2001 with the WP being disqualified due to incomplete applications, but in the 2006 elections, the WP were able to pose a strong challenge for this ward, with the members consist of WP&#x27;s chairwoman Sylvia Lim and former members Goh Meng Seng and James Gomez.

The GRC was managed by the PAP which members include Cynthia Phua and George Yeo, until it became the first opposition held GRC since the creation of the GRC in Singapore after the 2011 Singaporean general election being taken over by Low Thia Khiang&#x27;s WP team. The WP continued to hold the GRC in the 2015 and 2020 Singaporean general elections with Leon Perera and Gerald Giam replacing Low and Chen Show Mao.

=== Ang Mo Kio GRC ===

The north-western portions of Hougang (Avenues 4, 8 and 9, and Street 91), which includes Hougang Stadium and Regentville Condo, falls under the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang division of the Ang Mo Kio GRC. Its MP is Darryl David, who replaces former MP Yeo Guat Kwang after the 2015 elections. Prior to the 2011 elections, the ward was a part of Aljunied GRC (under the name of Aljunied-Hougang), where Yeo was then the MP.

The northern portions of Hougang (north of Avenues 6, 8 and Street 51) also falls under the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang division, part of Ang Mo Kio GRC. It previously belonged to Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC (under the name of Punggol South) until it was carved out in 2015. After the 2020 elections, the portion was merged with the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang division.

The western portions of Hougang, previously being Serangoon Gardens division, were split into two divisions with Jalan Kayu in the Ang Mo Kio GRC and Serangoon in the Aljunied GRC.

=== Marine Parade GRC ===

The southernmost portion of Hougang, Tai Seng, was under the Geylang Serai division of Marine Parade GRC, where Mohd Fahmi Aliman represented the ward. Marine Parade was also contested by WP during the 2015 and 2020 elections.

<text>Domineering (also called Stop-Gate or Crosscram) is a mathematical game that can be played on any collection of squares on a sheet of graph paper. For example, it can be played on a 6×6 square, a rectangle, an entirely irregular polyomino, or a combination of any number of such components. Two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the grid in turn, covering up squares. One player places tiles vertically, while the other places them horizontally. (Traditionally, these players are called &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot;, respectively, or &quot;V&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. Both conventions are used in this article.)
As in most games in combinatorial game theory, the first player who cannot move loses.

Domineering is a partisan game, in that players use different pieces: the impartial version of the game is Cram.

==Basic examples==

===Single box===
Other than the empty game, where there is no grid, the simplest game is a single box.

In this game, clearly, neither player can move. Since it is a second-player win, it is therefore a zero game.

===Horizontal rows===
This game is a 2-by-1 grid. There is a convention of assigning the game a positive number when Left is winning and a negative one when Right is winning. In this case, Left has no moves, while Right can play a domino to cover the entire board, leaving nothing, which is clearly a zero game. Thus in surreal number notation, this game is {|0} = −1. This makes sense, as this grid is a 1-move advantage for Right.

This game is also {|0} = −1, because a single box is unplayable.

This grid is the first case of a choice. Right &quot;could&quot; play the left two boxes, leaving −1. The rightmost boxes leave −1 as well. He could also play the middle two boxes, leaving two single boxes. This option leaves 0+0 = 0. Thus this game can be expressed as {|0,−1}. This is −2. If this game is played in conjunction with other games, this is two free moves for Right.

====Vertical rows====
Vertical columns are evaluated in the same way. If there is a row of 2&quot;n&quot; or 2&quot;n&quot;+1 boxes, it counts as −&quot;n&quot;. A column of such size counts as +&quot;n&quot;.

===More complex grids===
&lt;br&gt;
This is a more complex game. If Left goes first, either move leaves a 1×2 grid, which is +1. Right, on the other hand, can move to −1. Thus the surreal number notation is {1|−1}. However, this is not a surreal number because 1 &gt; −1. This is a Game but not a number. The notation for this is ±1, and it is a hot game, because each player wants to move here.

&lt;br&gt;
This is a 2×3 grid, which is even more complex, but, just like any Domineering game, it can be broken down by looking at what the various moves for Left and Right are. Left can take the left column (or, equivalently, the right column) and move to ±1, but it is clearly a better idea to split the middle, leaving two separate games, each worth +1. Thus Left&#x27;s best move is to +2. Right has four &quot;different&quot; moves, but they all leave the following shape in some rotation:

&lt;br&gt;
This game is not a hot game (also called a cold game), because each move hurts the player making it, as we can see by examining the moves. Left can move to −1, Right can move to 0 or +1. Thus this game is {−1|0,1} = {−1|0} = −.

Our 2×3 grid, then, is {2|−}, which can also be represented by the mean value, , together with the bonus for moving (the &quot;temperature&quot;), , thus: formula_1

==High-level play==

The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute held a Domineering tournament with a $500 prize for the winner. This game was played on an 8×8 board. The winner was mathematician Dan Calistrate, who defeated David Wolfe in the final. The tournament was detailed in Richard J. Nowakowski&#x27;s &quot;Games of No Chance&quot; (p. 85).

==Winning strategy==

A problem about Domineering is to compute the winning strategy for large boards, and particularly square boards. In 2000, Dennis Breuker, Jos Uiterwijk and Jaap van den Herik computed and published the solution for the 8x8 board. The 9x9 board followed soon after some improvements of their program. Then, in 2002, Nathan Bullock solved the 10x10 board, as part of his thesis on Domineering. The 11x11 board has been solved by Jos Uiterwijk in 2016.

Domineering is a first-player win for the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8, 9x9, 10x10, and 11x11 square boards, and a second-player win for the 1x1 and 5x5 boards. Some other known values for rectangular boards can be found on the site of Nathan Bullock.

==Cram==

Cram is the impartial version of Domineering. The only difference in the rules is that each player may place their dominoes in either orientation. It seems only a small variation in the rules, but it results in a completely different game that can be analyzed with the Sprague–Grundy theorem.

<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sengoku period. He was the eldest son of Bessho Yasuharu.

In 1578 Oda Nobunaga called on his retainers to attack the Mōri clan. Nagaharu almost decided to ally with the Oda clan, but after hearing that the low-born general Hashiba Hideyoshi, whom he did not respect, was leading the troops, he revolted and instead allied himself with Hatano Hideharu of Tanba province.

Nagaharu took a stand at Miki Castle, and was besieged by Hideyoshi&#x27;s troops on the orders of Nobunaga. The Siege of Miki did not go well for Hideyoshi, and with a revolt by Araki Murashige and the help of the Mōri clan, Nagaharu successfully repelled the Oda force. 

In 1579, Hideyoshi returned and instead of launching a direct assault, he launched multiple sieges against smaller castles like Kamiyoshi Castle and Sigata Castle to cut off the support from Mōri. This led to a rapid depletion of food, and in 1580, with no hope of another reinforcement from Mōri clan, Nagaharu committed seppuku in exchange for the lives of the troops in Miki Castle.

<text>Arøya is a group of three small islands in Larvik Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. They are located in the outer part of the Langesundsfjorden approximately midway between the town of Langesund (in Bamble Municipality in Telemark) and the village of Helgeroa in Larvik. The three islands are named Store Arøya, Lille Arøya, and Vesle Arøya (&#x27;Big&#x27;, &#x27;Small&#x27; and &#x27;Tiny&#x27; Arøya).

The islands of Arøya are a recreational cottage area for the population in the Grenland, Vestfold, and even as far away as Oslo, about a 90-minute drive away. There are still a few families residing on the islands, where fishing is the prime source of income. In the summer season, a local ferry (Skjæløy) connects Helgeroa with Langesund. The ferry makes several stops on the islands. The trip is frequently used by tourists going roundtrip for a great view of the area. Bikers also use the ferry as a shortcut connection to the southern shores of Norway.

<doc id="1190534" wikidata="Q358900" url="?curid=1190534" title="Robert Maudsley">
<text>Robert John Maudsley (born 26 June 1953) is an English man convicted of multiple murders. Maudsley killed four people, with one of the killings taking place in a psychiatric hospital and two in prison after receiving a life sentence for a murder. Initial reports falsely stated he ate part of the brain of one of the men he killed in prison, which earned him the nickname &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot; from parts of the British press and &quot;The Brain Eater&quot; amongst other prisoners. National newspapers were advised that the allegations were untrue, according to the post-mortem report. Maudsley is the longest-serving British prisoner in solitary confinement.

==Early life==
Robert Maudsley was the fourth of 12 children, born in Speke, Liverpool. He spent his early years in a Catholic orphanage in Crosby, with his three older siblings. At the age of eight, Maudsley and his three older siblings were retrieved by their parents. Robert was subjected to routine physical abuse from his father until he was removed from their care by social services. Maudsley later stated that he was raped as a child by his father, and such early abuse left deep psychological scars.

As a teenager during the late 1960s, Maudsley was a sex worker in London, using his income to support his drug addiction. He was forced to seek psychiatric help after several suicide attempts. He told doctors that he claimed to hear voices telling him to kill his parents. He is quoted as saying &quot;If I had killed my parents in 1970, none of these people would have died.&quot;

==Murders==
In 1974, Maudsley garrotted John Farrell in Wood Green, London. Farrell picked up Maudsley for sex and showed him pictures of children he had sexually abused. Maudsley surrendered himself to police, saying he needed psychiatric care. Maudsley was found unfit to stand trial and was sent to Broadmoor Hospital. 

In 1977, he and another patient, David Cheeseman, who was serving a sentence for the rape and sexual assault of a sixteen-year-old girl, locked themselves in a cell with a third patient, David Francis, a convicted child molester. The attack was claimed to be in revenge for a &quot;homosexual attack&quot; on one of the friends of the two men. They tortured him to death over a period of nine hours. After this incident, Maudsley was convicted of manslaughter and sent to Wakefield Prison. He disliked the transfer and made it clear he wanted to return to Broadmoor. Maudsley was later sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he never be released.

In 1978, Maudsley killed two fellow prisoners at Wakefield Prison in one day. He had originally set out to kill seven. His first victim was Salney Darwood, imprisoned for killing his wife. At the time, Darwood had been giving Maudsley French lessons. Maudsley invited Darwood to his cell, where he garrotted and stabbed him before hiding his body under his bed. He then attempted to lure other prisoners into his cell, but all refused.

Maudsley then prowled the wing hunting for a second victim, cornering and stabbing prisoner William Roberts to death as he was lying in his bed. He hacked at Roberts&#x27; skull with a makeshift dagger and then struck his head against the wall multiple times. Maudsley calmly walked into the wing office, placed the dagger on the table and told the officer that the next roll call would be two short.

Maudsley states his victims were rapists, paedophiles or sex offenders, and that those are the people to whom he is a threat.

==Victims==
* John Farrell, age 30, on 14 March 1974. Farrell showed Maudsley photographs of children he had molested.
* David Francis, age 26, on 26 February 1977. Francis was a convicted child molester, sentenced to Broadmoor.
* Salney Darwood, age 46, on 29 July 1978. Darwood was imprisoned for sexual assault and the killing of his wife.
* William Roberts, age 56, on 29 July 1978. Convicted for sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl.

==Solitary confinement==

In 1983, Maudsley was deemed too dangerous for a normal cell. Prison authorities built a two-cell unit in the basement of Wakefield Prison. Due to his history of violence, when outside his cell he is escorted by at least four prison officers.

In March 2000, Maudsley unsuccessfully pleaded for the terms of his solitary confinement to be relaxed, or to be allowed to take his own life via a cyanide capsule. He asked for a pet budgerigar, which was denied.

<text>Bolton Meredith Eyres-Monsell, 1st Viscount Monsell (born Monsell; 22 February 1881 – 21 March 1969) was a British Conservative Party politician who served as Chief Whip until 1931 and then as First Lord of the Admiralty.

==Biography==
His parents were Lt. Col. Bolton James Alfred Monsell, a soldier and a Chief Constable in the Metropolitan Police, and Mary Beverley, daughter of Sir Edmund Ogle, 6th Baronet. Bolton Monsell took the name Eyres upon his marriage to Caroline Mary Sybil Eyres in 1904, a marriage dissolved in 1950.

Eyres-Monsell served in the Royal Navy, where he was promoted sub-lieutenant on 15 July 1900, and lieutenant on 15 July 1901. In June 1902 he was posted to the newly completed torpedo boat destroyer HMS &quot;Success&quot;, serving in the Portsmouth instructional flotilla, but only two months later, in August 1902, he was transferred to the battleship HMS &quot;Magnificent&quot;, flagship of the second in command, Channel Squadron.

He was elected as Member of Parliament for the Evesham Division of Worcestershire in January 1910 general election, and served until 1935. During the First World War, he again served as a Royal Navy officer, achieving the rank of Commander and was awarded the Order of the Nile by the Sultan of Egypt. He was Civil Lord of the Admiralty from April 1921 to October 1922; then Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty until May 1923, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury from July 1923 to January 1924, and again from November 1924 to June 1929 and from September 1931 to November 1931. He became First Lord of the Admiralty in 1931, helped negotiate the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, retaining his office in government until 1936.

He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1929 and was created Viscount Monsell, of Evesham in the County of Worcester on 30 November 1935.

He married a second time on 25 July 1950 to Essex Leila Hilary French. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his son Graham. His second daughter, the Hon. Joan Eyres-Monsell (1912–2003), was married for the second time in 1968 to Patrick Leigh Fermor, the traveller and author. Lord Monsell&#x27;s nephew was the British arctic explorer Henry George Watkins (1907–1932).

A suburb of Leicester is named Eyres Monsell after him; the housing estate was built on land he had owned before it was compulsorily purchased in the early 1950s.
