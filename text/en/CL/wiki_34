<text>Anthony Hamilton ( – 1719), also known as Antoine and comte d&#x27;Hamilton, was a soldier and a writer. As a Catholic of Irish and Scottish ancestry, his parents brought him to France in 1651 when Cromwell&#x27;s army overran Ireland.

At the Restoration the family moved to England and lived at Whitehall. When Catholics were excluded from the army, Anthony followed his brother George into French service and fought in the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678). He was wounded in the Battle of Entzheim. After the accession of the Catholic James II in 1685, he joined the Irish Army and fought for the Jacobites in the Williamite War (1689–1691). He saw action in the battles of Newtownbutler and the Boyne. The defeat led him to his last French exile.

In France Hamilton lived at the exile court at Saint-Germain-en-Laye where he became a courtier, poet, and writer. He chose French as his language and adopted a light and elegant style, seeking to amuse and entertain his reader. He wrote the &quot;Mémoires du Comte de Grammont&quot;, which focuses on the time his brother-in-law Philibert de Gramont spent at the court of Charles II. These memoirs are a classic of French literature and a source for the history of the Stuart Restoration. Hamilton also wrote many letters, poems, and five tales.










== Birth and origins ==
Anthony was born in 1644 or 1645
in Ireland, probably at Nenagh (), County Tipperary.
He was the third son of Sir George Hamilton and his wife Mary Butler.

His father was Scottish, the fourth son of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Abercorn. He supported the lord lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, Marquess of Ormond, during the Irish Confederate Wars and the Cromwellian conquest and called himself a baronet.

Anthony&#x27;s mother was half Irish and half English, the third daughter of Thomas Butler, Viscount Thurles, and his English Catholic wife Elizabeth Poyntz. Thurles (courtesy title) predeceased his father, Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond, and never succeeded to the earldom. The Butlers were Old English. She was a sister of James Butler, making Anthony&#x27;s father a brother-in-law of the lord lieutenant.

Anthony&#x27;s father has been confused with his granduncle George Hamilton of Greenlaw and Roscrea. Both are called George and both married a Mary Butler. In 1640 Ormond had granted Anthony&#x27;s father Nenagh for 31 years. Anthony was probably born there.
Hamilton&#x27;s parents had married in 1635.

Anthony was one of nine siblings. They are listed in his father&#x27;s article, but also see James, George, Elizabeth, Richard, and John individually. Anthony&#x27;s parents were both Catholic, and so was he.

== Irish childhood ==
Hamilton was born during the Irish Confederate War. His father, despite being Catholic, sided with the lord lieutenant against the Confederates. The war had been halted by a truce in 1643. An attempted peace failed in March 1646. After a last extension the truce expired on 1 May. The newborn Anthony, his mother, and his siblings were brought to Dublin in May for their security.

In 1647 Ormond abandoned Dublin to the parliamentarians and left for England. Anthony, his mother, and siblings seem to have stayed behind in Ireland. Ormond together with Anthony&#x27;s father returned to Ireland in 1648. In 1649, during the Cromwellian conquest, Ormond made Anthony&#x27;s father receiver-general of the revenues as well as governor of Nenagh Castle, which he in vain tried to defend against Henry Ireton in November 1650.

== First exile ==
Having lost the leadership to the Catholic clergy, Ormond left for France in December 1650. Hamilton&#x27;s father followed with his family in spring 1651. Anthony was about seven. They were accommodated by Anthony&#x27;s aunt Elizabeth Preston, the Marchioness of Ormond, near Caen, Normandy. His father and his elder brothers, James and George, served Charles II in various functions. Lady Ormond left for England in August 1652, whereas Anthony&#x27;s mother moved to Paris, where she lodged in the . The Hamilton brothers frequented Charles II&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s, Henrietta Maria, exile court at the Louvre.

== Restoration ==
In May 1660 the Restoration brought Charles II on the English throne. Hamilton&#x27;s father and his elder brothers moved to Whitehall, where the court was. Charles II restored Donalong, Ulster, to Hamilton&#x27;s father. About that year Charles allegedly created Hamilton&#x27;s father baronet of Donalong and Nenagh.

Hamilton&#x27;s elder brothers, James and George, became courtiers at Whitehall. The King arranged a Protestant marriage for James. Early in 1661 Hamilton&#x27;s father also brought his wife and younger children to London, where they lived all together in a house near Whitehall.

In January 1663, at the court, the Hamilton brothers met Philibert, chevalier de Gramont, who had been exiled by Louis XIV for courting a maid of honour, on whom he had set his eyes.

Gramont integrated easily as French was spoken at the court.
Hamilton befriended Gramont, who soon became part of the inner circle. Gramont courted Hamilton&#x27;s sister Elizabeth.

An anecdote tells how George and Anthony intercepted Gramont at Dover, asking him whether he had not forgotten something in London. He replied &quot;Pardonnez-moi, messieurs, j&#x27;ai oublié d&#x27;épouser votre sœur.&quot; (Forgive me, Sirs, I have forgotten to marry your sister). This episode might have happened in autumn 1663 when Gramont&#x27;s sister Susanne-Charlotte told him in error that he could return to France. He went but found that he was not welcome. However, perhaps Gramont attempted to leave Elizabeth later, in December just before he announced his intention to marry her.

Gramont married Elizabeth in London, either in December 1663 or early in 1664. In March 1664, Louis XIV, having heard of Gramont&#x27;s marriage, allowed him to return.

== Second exile ==
In 1667 the King dismissed from his Life Guards the Catholics who refused to take the Oath of Supremacy. Among them was Anthony&#x27;s brother George, who in 1668 went to France. Anthony probably accompanied him. In 1671 George recruited a regiment in Ireland for French service. Hamilton seems to have accompanied him and in May helped his cousin John Butler to extinguish a fire in Dublin Castle. Hamilton then took service in his brother&#x27;s regiment, fighting in the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678). George and Anthony were later joined by their younger brother Richard. In 1672 the regiment garrisoned Liège and then occupied Utrecht in June. In 1673 Hamilton, by now a Captain, was in Limerick recruiting for the regiment.

Anthony probably fought together with George under Turenne against Imperial troops in the Battle of Sinsheim in June 1674, and did surely so at Entzheim in October, where both were wounded. In the winter 1674–5 Anthony, George, and Richard travelled to England from where George returned to France while Anthony and Richard continued to Ireland to recruit. French ships picked up the recruits at Kinsale in April 1675, after a missed appointment at Dingle in March. Hamilton&#x27;s Irish voyage caused him to miss Turenne&#x27;s winter campaign in which Turenne marched south and surprised the Germans in upper Alsace, beating them at Turckheim.

In July 1675 Hamilton&#x27;s regiment was at Sasbach, where George witnessed Turenne&#x27;s death. At the retreat from Sasbach in August, the regiment suffered 450 casualties in the rearguard actions of the Battle of Altenheim. Louis XIV called in Condé, who stopped the German advance but retired at the end of the campaign. In the winter 1675–6 George, accompanied by either Anthony or Richard, again went recruiting and visited Lady Arran, wife of Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran, in January 1676. She called them &quot;ye monsieurs&quot;. The regiment quartered that winter in Toul.

Luxembourg commanded on the Rhine in the campaign of 1676. In June George was killed in a rearguard action at the Zaberner Steige (Col de Saverne), where Imperial troops under the Duke of Lorraine pursued the French who were retreating eastward to Zabern (Saverne) in lower Alsace. Reputedly, Hamilton succeeded his brother as &quot;comte d&#x27;Hamilton&quot;, but that title may never have existed.
Thomas Dongan, who had been lieutenant-colonel, was preferred over Hamilton as the new colonel of what had been Hamilton&#x27;s regiment. Louis XIV told Anthony that he had no regiment for him. Anthony left while Richard became lieutenant-colonel.

The Franco-Dutch war ended with the Treaties of Nijmegen, concluded between August 1678 and October 1679. The regiment was disbanded in December, anticipating the signature in February 1679 of the peace between France and the Emperor.

== Ireland ==
Hamilton had returned to Ireland by 1677. His father died in 1679. His nephew James, the future 6th Earl of Abercorn, then aged 17 or 18, inherited the family&#x27;s lands.

Hamilton may have visited France and have been the &quot;comte d&#x27;Hamilton&quot; who in January 1681 played a zephyr in the performance of Quinault&#x27;s ballet &quot;Triomphe de l&#x27;Amour&quot;, to music by Lully, at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye before Louis XIV. However, possibly, this was Richard. In summer 1681 Anthony lived in Dublin.

In February 1685 the Catholic James II acceded to the English throne. In April James sent Richard Talbot to Ireland to purge the Irish Army of &quot;Cromwellians&quot;. Talbot replaced Protestants with Catholics, recruiting among others Anthony and his younger brothers Richard and John. Anthony was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Sir Thomas Newcomen&#x27;s infantry regiment. In June James created Talbot earl of Tyrconnell. In August Hamilton was also made governor of Limerick, where his company of Newcomen&#x27;s regiment was garrisoned, replacing Sir William King, a Protestant. Hamilton attended Mass in public. In October 1685 the king appointed Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, a Protestant, lord lieutenant of Ireland. Clarendon arrived in January 1686. He considered Hamilton a moderate Catholic and possible ally. Clarendon praised Hamilton, saying that he understood the regiment better than its colonel. Clarendon also stated that Hamilton objected to replacing good Protestant officers with mediocre Catholic ones. Near the end of 1686, Hamilton became a member of the Irish privy council. In 1687 he was promoted colonel. In 1688 Hamilton was colonel of a regiment of foot.

At the eve of the Glorious Revolution in September 1688, James asked Tyrconnell to send four Irish regiments to England. Hamilton&#x27;s was among them. The troops landed on the English west coast in October and marched across the midlands to southern England. Hamilton&#x27;s regiment was stationed in Portsmouth, where the Duke of Berwick was governor. The regiment surrendered in Portsmouth on 20 December.
On the 23 James II embarked for France. It seems that Hamilton followed him. Anthony and John returned with James II to Ireland in 1689. Richard was already there.

In 1689 during the Williamite War, Tyrconnell promoted Hamilton major-general and gave him the command of the dragoons of an army under Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel, that he sent north to Belturbet, County Cavan, to fight the rebels of Enniskillen. In the battle of Newtownbutler, in July, Hamilton commanded the horse. The outcome would show that he was &quot;better with his pen than with his sword&quot;. Mountcashel asked him to pursue retreating enemy troops, but the enemy led him into a trap and Hamilton&#x27;s dragoons were routed. Hamilton was wounded in the leg at the beginning of the action and fled the scene. With Captain Peter Lavallin of Carroll&#x27;s dragoons he was court martialled by Rosen, the highest-ranking French general. Given his family&#x27;s influence, Hamilton was acquitted, but Lavallin was shot. This affair destroyed Hamilton&#x27;s reputation as a soldier. When in spring 1690 the Irish Brigade was formed, the French wanted neither Richard nor Anthony among its officers.

Anthony, as well as his brothers Richard and John, fought at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. Anthony rode in the cavalry charges. Afterwards he fought at the first Siege of Limerick. When William abandoned his siege end of August, Tyrconnell sent Hamilton to France to report the deliverance. He may not have returned. His presence at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 is disputed, but his brother John was fatally wounded there.

== Final exile, death, and timeline ==
Hamilton lived the last thirty years of his life at the exile court at the Château-Vieux of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
He held no office, but James II granted him a generous pension. 
Hamilton was also given an apartment in the castle. He was appreciated as an ornament of that court.


At Saint-Germain Hamilton got acquainted with the Bulkeley sisters, especially Anne and Henrietta. Their father, Henry, master of the household to Charles II at Whitehall and to James at Saint-Germain, died in 1698. Their mother, Sophia, was a sister of the Belle Stuart. Berwick married Anne in 1700 at Saint-Germain, as his second wife. Hamilton affectionately called her &quot;Nanette&quot;. He was in love with Henrietta or at least wrote her admirative letters. She was about 30 years younger than him and had no dowry.
Hamilton thought his pension insufficient to support a family.

About 1696 Hamilton wrote his tale &quot;Zénéyde&quot;,
in which he denounces the bigotry of James&#x27;s last years. Early in 1701 Hamilton accompanied Berwick to Rome to ask the new pope, Clement XI, for help. In March James suffered a stroke. Berwick was called for and arrived back in Saint-Germain in April. In September James II died at the Château-Vieux of Saint-Germain. Hamilton wrote a poem &quot;Sur l&#x27;agonie du feu roi d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; [On the Agony of the Late King of England]. His successor, James III, was 13. The court became gayer and Hamilton like it better.

In 1703 Louis XIV gave Hamilton&#x27;s sister Elizabeth a house at Versailles, where Hamilton often visited. In 1704 Hamilton went to see Gramont at Séméac in Gascogne, where he decided to write his friend&#x27;s memoirs. Hamilton was part of the circle around the Duchess of Maine, where he was known as &quot;Horace d&#x27;Albion&quot;. It was partly at her seat at Sceaux that he wrote the &quot;Mémoires&quot;. In 1705 he attended the feast that Nicolas de Malézieu and the duchess gave at Châtenay.

In 1707 Gramont died in Paris. Hamilton was said to have sailed to Scotland in the attempted invasion of 1708, but only Richard went. In June Hamilton&#x27;s sister Elizabeth died in Paris.

In 1712 James III left Saint-Germain as France was about to drop the Jacobites, a concession they made in 1713 at the Peace of Utrecht. Richard followed James III to Bar-le-Duc in Lorraine, whereas Anthony stayed behind at Saint-Germain and was allowed to keep his apartment. The dowager queen, Mary of Modena, also stayed. Hamilton met the young Voltaire at the suppers of the shortly before 1715.
Hamilton never married and died at Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 20 April 1719.
He was buried on the 21 in the parish church. A distant cousin, John Nugent, equerry to James III, attended the funeral.

== Works ==
Hamilton came from an English-speaking family but chose to write in French. Despite his origins he excelled in that light and elegant badinage considered typically French.

Hamilton&#x27;s works were well known in the 18th century. Voltaire and La Harpe mention him honourably. Today, he is mainly known for a single book: the &quot;Mémoires de la vie du comte de Grammont&quot;, the only work published while he was alive. Hamilton also wrote at least five tales and many poems, songs, epistles, and letters (ordered by year of publication):

=== Gramont&#x27;s memoirs ===
The &quot;Mémoires de la vie du comte de Grammont&quot; were originally planned to cover Gramont&#x27;s entire life but were cut short so that they end with his marriage. Hamilton pretended the memoirs were dictated to him by Gramont. He started work in 1704 and completed them in 1710. For Gramont&#x27;s life up to his arrival in London, Gramont was Hamilton&#x27;s only source. He may have jotted this part down more or less how Gramont told it. The second, &quot;English&quot;, part seems to be Hamilton&#x27;s work. The subtitle of the first edition &quot;L&#x27;histore amoureuse de la cour d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (lovelife of the English court) pertains to this part, for which Hamilton had Gramont, who died in 1707, and Elizabeth, who died in 1708, as witnesses. Hamilton&#x27;s brothers James and George, important characters of the second part, had died in 1673 and 1676 respectively.

The book was a bestseller and remains a classic of French literature. It is still admired for its graceful and elegant language. The memoirs were written to amuse and entertain and sometimes depart from the correct chronological order. The book situates itself at the cross-roads between memoirs, biography, and fiction.

The memoirs were first circulated in manuscript and then published anonymously in 1713, without the author&#x27;s consent. The imprint says: Cologne by Pierre Marteau, a pseudonym often used for disreputable books. It might have been published in Holland, or at Rouen. In 1817 the Catholic Church inscribed the book on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Early French editions often deformed the English names. Horace Walpole, a great admirer, corrected them in his Strawberry Hill edition of 1772.

The first English translation, by Abel Boyer, had followed in hot pursuit in 1714. Boyer, fearing an uproar, hid the persons&#x27; identities behind their initials. Many new or amended translations were published in due course. W. Maddison published one in 1793. Walter Scott amended an English translation in 1809 and again in 1811. Henry Vizetelly published another revised translation in 1889. Peter Quennell retranslated the memoirs in 1930 (read online).

=== Tales ===
Hamilton&#x27;s tales (&quot;contes&quot;) were inspired by the fairy tales that became popular in France in the 1690s
and by the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, published between 1704 and 1708 by Antoine Galland. Hamilton&#x27;s tales are their parodies or fan fiction. The characters&#x27; adventures are often extravagant. Hamilton likes to use multiple narrators, who may tell the same events from different points of view.

His tales influenced Voltaire and Crébillon the younger in the 18th century. The tale Fleur d&#x27;Epine has been praised by La Harpe for its charming truths and its moral. Montégut called it &quot;the most beautiful fairy tale written in France&quot;. George Saintsbury maintains that Hamilton&#x27;s tales have more literary merit than his fanous memoirs.

&quot;Zénéyde&quot; (read online), written about 1696, starts as a letter to &quot;Madame de P.&quot;, in which Hamilton criticises James II&#x27;s exile court and then escapes into fiction by meeting a nymph at the Seine. The nymph, called Zénéyde, tells her life. Her father was the Roman emperor Maximus and her mother a daughter of the Frankish king Clodio. She was to marry Childeric but was caught by Genserich at Aquileia. At that point the nymph is overcome by emotion and a beautiful brunette takes over as story teller. The text stops here as Hamilton left &quot;Zénéyde&quot; incomplete.

&quot;Le Bélier&quot; (read online), written in 1705, gives an etymology for &quot;Pontalie&quot;, the name his sister Elizabeth invented for Les Moulineaux, her house at Versailles. The story starts in verse and then continues in prose. A giant called Moulineaux has an ingenious ram. His neighbour, a druide, has a beautiful daughter called Alie. The giant wants to marry Alie, but she is in love with the prince of Noisy. Her father protects her by surrounding his castle with water. The ram builds a bridge across it. This is Alie&#x27;s bridge, or Pont-Alie. After many detours full of comical and absurd inventions the ram, who is really the prince of Noisy, marries Alie. Voltaire praised the introduction in verse, and mentioned in 1729 that Josse was printing the &quot;Bélier&quot;. It was the first of Hamilton&#x27;s tales to be published and must have been a success as Josse went on to publish two more of them and the first collection of his works, &quot;Œuvres mêlées en prose et en vers&quot;.

&quot;Fleur d&#x27;Épine&quot; (read online) shares the frame of &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and starts with a dialogue between Scheherazade and her sister Dinarzade. Dinarzade tells the sultan a story with the condition that he must spare Scheherazade&#x27;s life should he interrupt that story. The sultan agrees and &quot;Fleur d&#x27;epine&quot; is this story.

The story starts with the eyes of Luisante, the daughter of the caliph of Kashmir, that kill men and blind women. A prince calling himself &quot;Tarare&quot; contacts the sorceress Serena, who agrees to help but demands that he must free Fleur d&#x27;Epine, held by the witch Dentue. Tarare travels to Dentue&#x27;s house. He
meets Fleur d&#x27;Epine posing as a shepherd. He frees her from Dentue and they return to Kashmir. On the way he tells her how he and his brother Phenix went to seek adventures. Serena gives Tarare the remedy that cures Luisante&#x27;s eyes. The caliph wants him to marry Luisante and fill his palace with baby Tarares. At the mention of &quot;baby Tarares&quot; the sultan interrupts Dinarzade and Scheherazade&#x27;s life is safe. Dinarzade continues her story: Tarare marries Fleur d&#x27;Epine, whereas Phenix marries Luisante. Phenix then tells his adventures which overlap with those of his brother.

&quot;Les quatre Facardins&quot; (read online) tells the adventures of three men, all called Facardin: Facardin of Trebizond, the handsome Facardin, and the tall Facardin. Hamilton left the story incomplete and never mentions the fourth Facardin. Saintsbury considers it the best of Hamilton&#x27;s tales. Facardin of Trebizond tells the story. He meets the handsome Facardin who tells his adventures on the Lions&#x27; Island and on Mount Atlas. He seeks adventures to become worthy of Mousseline. Facardin of Trebizond then meets Cristalline who is the lady of the rings from &quot;Arabian nights&quot;. She tells her life in which she was married to a genie but loved the tall Facardin. Facardin of Trebizond delivers Cristalline from the genie and they meet the tall Facardin. The story breaks off at that point.

&quot;L&#x27;Enchanteur Faustus&quot; (read online) tells how Faust conjures up Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, Fair Rosamond, and other beauties to appear before Queen Elizabeth of England. Contrary to Hamilton&#x27;s other tales, this one is linear and easy to follow. Hamilton dedicated it to his niece Margaret, his brother John&#x27;s daughter.

Hamilton&#x27;s tales were circulated privately as manuscripts during his lifetime. The first three were published individually in Paris in 1730, ten years after the author&#x27;s death. A collection of his works, &quot;Œuvres mêlées en prose et en vers&quot;, published in 1731, contains the unfinished &quot;Zénéyde&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Enchanteur Faustus&quot; was published belatedly in 1776 but might have been written much earlier, probably even before the memoirs.

=== Other works ===
Hamilton also wrote songs and exchanged amusing verses with the Duke of Berwick. He helped his niece Claude Charlotte, Gramont&#x27;s daughter, who had married Henry Stafford-Howard, 1st Earl of Stafford, in 1694, to carry on a witty correspondence with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.

<text>The Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway in Kent is a narrow gauge heritage railway that operates from Sittingbourne to the banks of The Swale.

The line was developed as an industrial railway by paper maker Frank Lloyd in 1904, to transport pulp materials and finished products between Ridham Dock, on the Swale, and the company&#x27;s paper mill at Sittingbourne, and from the mid-1920s to a second mill at Kemsley.

In the late 1960s, the railway faced closure by its then owners Bowater, but the Locomotive Club of Great Britain accepted an offer to operate the railway from 1970. However, the section of line from Kemsley Down to Ridham Dock was abandoned for redevelopment of the paper mills.

In 2008–09, the line survived a threat of closure due to the owners of Sittingbourne Paper Mill closing the mill and selling the land. The lease then held by the railway expired in January 2009, but negotiations resulted in the railway being saved, although no public trains ran in 2009.

In September 2010, press reports announced the possibility that the railway would operate an anniversary service - over a short section between Kemsley Down Station and the Milton Regis Halt - to celebrate 40 years of operation. The service carried more than 700 passengers over several days during October.

In 2011, the railway reopened in late May and operated until the end of September. During this time, Milton Regis Viaduct&#x27;s deferred maintenance, from winter 2008, was carried out and Essential Land&#x27;s contractors completed the removal of pipelines around Sittingbourne Viaduct station. The last train of the season ran over Milton Regis Viaduct to the gate at Sittingbourne Viaduct station - the first public train to cross the Viaduct since 26 December 2008.

2012 saw the railway return to Sittingbourne Viaduct when it reopened on Sunday 27 May. (See &quot;Reopening&quot; section below.)

== History ==

In 1905, the horse-drawn tramway operating around the paper mill was upgraded to steam operation with the purchase of two steam locomotives, &quot;Premier&quot; and &quot;Leader&quot;, which were still there for the centenary celebrations in 2005. Other locomotives were bought for use on the railway as the network expanded.

In the 1960s, a time-and-motion study was undertaken by the owners, Bowaters UK, and the railway was deemed to be more expensive than road transport and was closed. However, Bowaters UK offered the main line, some of the locos and rolling stock of the railway to the Locomotive Club of Great Britain for preservation as a tourist railway. Other locomotives and rolling stock were sold to the Great Whipsnade Railway and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The SKLR is now the longest continuous operator of the railway.

In January 2007, M-real closed Sittingbourne Paper Mill. However, Church Marshes Country Park now has a managing committee and will see the surrounding area between Milton Regis Halt and Kemsley Down being turned into a fully-fledged country park.

== Preservation ==

The railway is now operated by the Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway and operates over almost of the original main line from Sittingbourne Viaduct station to Kemsley Down station. It crosses one of the first and longest reinforced concrete viaducts in the world between Sittingbourne Viaduct and Milton Regis Halt stations.

The main fleet of locomotives worked the railway before it was preserved. &quot;Barton Hall&quot; was the first new arrival on the railway in over 25 years on long-term loan and was eventually purchased by the railway to assist with railway operations.

In 2005, the railway had its first ever visit of a steam loco: &#x27;Chevallier&#x27; returned to the railway after being sold to a new owner. It arrived at the railway on a low loader days before the centenary celebrations and stayed on site until early 2006, when it was taken away for restoration. &#x27;Chevallier&#x27; was originally built for the Admiralty&#x27;s Chattenden &amp; Upnor Railway before being sold to Bowaters for use on the Paper Railway, and later moved to the Great Whipsnade Railway. Excelsior, Conqueror and Superior also moved to the Great Whipsnade Railway when it officially opened in 1970.

The railway was closed to the public for the 2009 season.

==Closure threat==

It was announced on the Meridian Television local news on 22 August 2008 that the railway was expected to close at the end of the year. The last public train was scheduled to depart Sittingbourne Viaduct at 14:00 on 26 December 2008, although the operating company were hoping that negotiations to keep the railway open into the future might be successful.

The railway attempted to buy the land it occupies. A bid of £1 was submitted in view of the high cost of removing asbestos-covered pipes alongside the line. The bid was rejected by M-real. English Heritage is considering whether or not to list the 118-span Milton Regis Viaduct. As well as the railway, the future of three feral cats that live under the café at Kemsley was also threatened. It was announced at the National Railway Museum on 4 September 2008 that the railway had won the 2008 Small Group award from the Heritage Railway Association.

The Heritage Railway Association supported a bid to secure the railway, overseen by Julian Birley of the North Norfolk Railway. Swale Borough Council were also reported as backing the scheme. At a full meeting of Swale Borough Council on 17 September, General Manager Tony James&#x27;s speech resulted in the council unanimously voting to support the railway in its fight to survive. Mr James credited the Heritage Railway Association with influencing the decision of the council by their actions in giving the award. On 21 September, the railway was visited by Baron Faulkner, chairman of the Railway Heritage Committee, a statutory body which oversees the preservation of railway artefacts in the United Kingdom. Lord Faulkner asked that the railway write to the Secretary of State for Transport in a bid for powers to gain a Compulsory Purchase Order which will enable the railway to buy the trackbed.

The line&#x27;s &quot;Farewell Gala&quot; on 27–28 September was declared a massive success, with the timetable being abandoned after the first train on the Saturday and altogether on the Sunday. Around 600 passengers were carried each day. After pressure from local MP Derek Wyatt, a meeting was held on 7 October between the railway and M-real about the future of the railway. A screening of the film &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; took place at Sittingbourne on 16 November to raise money for the fighting fund.

In November 2008, the railway was contracted to remove asbestos pipes from a section alongside the railway. On 12 November, &quot;Triumph&quot; was used to haul the train, just days before its boiler certificate expired.

It was revealed that the Government had been asked to use international diplomacy in the campaign to prevent closure. Lord Faulkner wrote to Lord Adonis asking for intervention at inter-Government level with the Finnish Government in an attempt to influence the decisions of Metsäliitto Group, who own M-real, to resolve the situation. At a meeting of Swale Borough Council on 12 November, representatives of M-real and their land agents refused to alter their position over the line. The preferred bidder for the land which the line occupies was to be announced on 18 December.

In November 2008, the railway carried commercial freight again. Some of the pipework that ran alongside the line was dismantled, and removed to Kemsley Down by rail as there was no road access. &quot;Triumph&quot; provided the motive power on 12 November as a one-off. The &quot;last train&quot; ran on 26 December, hauled by &quot;Triumph&quot; on her last day in service before her boiler certificate expired. It was driven by Keith Twyman, who had driven the first train when the SKLR opened. A power cut at Kemsley Down meant that some of the railway&#x27;s staff were unable to access the railway, so an empty stock working was run to Sittingbourne to collect them. After the final public service had run, a members special was run. Although there had been no response from M-Real, the railway was planning a week of engineering work in mid-January and also to continue the restoration of &quot;Superb&quot;. It was reported that the railway was planning to run trains on the line even after the lease expired on 29 January. Swale Borough Council&#x27;s portfolio holder for regeneration was authorised to continue negotiations with M-Real with a view to retaining the whole of the railway on its present site. It was reported that M-Real had offered to sell a length of the line to the council, who could then lease it to SKLR. This was dismissed by the railway as being impracticable as there was no road access to the stretch of line.

Reports that the railway would continue to run after its lease had expired were dismissed as speculation as negotiations between SKLR, Swale Borough Council, developers and M-Real continued. It was announced on 24 March 2009 that negotiations had been concluded between SKLR and M-Real. A press release stated:-


The freehold of Kemsley Down station is held by D F Smith Ltd, owner of St Regis Paper. The viaduct and Sittingbourne station are part of the estate which D F Smith Ltd are purchasing from M-Real and the SKLR need to negotiate future use of these sites. The railway announced that no public trains will run for the 2009 season, although &quot;Melior&quot; appeared at a steam rally at Preston-next-Wingham, Kent on 27 and 28 June, running on temporary track. &quot;Melior&quot; was also in action at Preston-next-Wingham on 1 January 2010.

In January 2010, it was reported that the railway was operating security trains over the line for M-Real in a bid to deter thieves from stealing metal for scrap. Three travellers received burns when they tried to steal live electricity cables from the viaduct at Milton Regis. The large pipeline which carries water at high pressure between Sittingbourne and Kemsley mills had also been damaged in an attempted theft.

Landlord D S Smith, owners of the Kemsley site have agreed to allow the SKLR to retain use of the site. As of January 2010, the station at Sittingbourne and the viaduct had not found a buyer.
At the start of September 2010, it was announced that the Railway would briefly reopen in October, running a series of passenger train specials on 24, 27, 30 and 31 October 2010. A number of volunteer work days were organised to prepare the line for these specials, and over 700 passengers were carried between Milton Regis and Kemsley Down. The line then closed again for ongoing maintenance, mainly to the viaduct, with the intention of reopening a full service between Sittingbourne Viaduct and Kemsley Down stations from 2012 onwards.

== Reopening ==
The Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway was originally planned to reopen on Good Friday 2012 but discovery of asbestos at the lineside caused a postponement to Sunday 27 May when the line between Sittingbourne Viaduct and Kemsley Down stations was finally reopened. The first train was hauled by &quot;Leader&quot; which carried about 200 passengers. The season ran until the last weekend in September. The reopening was branded as &quot;Return to Sittingbourne Viaduct&quot; and &quot;Back in Town&quot;.

Steam locomotives &quot;Leader&quot; returned to service in April and &quot;Superb&quot; in July respectively to ease the workload on &quot;Melior&quot;.

The Railway celebrated its Golden Anniversary of Handover in September/October 2019 and the 50th anniversary of public trains in 2020. 2022 is the 50th Anniversary of the Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway as a separate entity.

== Milton Regis Viaduct ==
Milton Regis Viaduct carries the line between Sittingbourne Viaduct station and Milton Regis (Asda) Halt, it is long and consists of 118 spans and six bridges (crossing The Wall, Flushing Street, Milton Creek, Kings Street, Gas Road and Cook&#x27;s Lane). It was constructed in 1914-15 out of reinforced concrete by Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd with engineers Rendel, Palmer &amp; Tritton. Believed to be the longest concrete viaduct in the UK. Its initial cost was £10,615 () and has cost the Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway £105,000 (to date) to repair and maintain - funded from the railway&#x27;s revenues, as the railway receives no external funding. During the winter of 2016/17, extensive additional repairs were carried out to Skew/Gas Road Bridge due to damage caused by over-height vehicles striking the bridge during the Gas Road/Cook&#x27;s Lane lowering project. These repairs cost an unplanned £20k, in addition to the regular £20k maintenance bill on even-numbered years.

<doc id="1165244" wikidata="Q388886" url="?curid=1165244" title="Chronon">
<text>A chronon is a proposed quantum of time, that is, a discrete and indivisible &quot;unit&quot; of time as part of a hypothesis that proposes that time is not continuous. In simple language, a chronon is the smallest, discrete, non-decomposable unit of time.

In a one-dimensional model, a chronon is a &quot;time interval&quot; or &quot;period&quot;, while in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional model it is a non-decomposable region in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional time. It is not easy to see how it could possibly be recast so as to postulate only a discrete spacetime (or even a merely dense one). For a set of instants to be dense, every instant not in the set must have a sequence of instants in the set that converge (get arbitrarily close) to it. For it to be a continuum, however, something more is required— that every set of instants earlier (later) than any given one should have a tight upper (lower) bound that is also an instant (see least upper bound property). It is continuity that enables modern mathematics to surmount the paradox of extension framed by the pre-Socratic eleatic Zeno—a paradox comprising the question of how a finite interval can be made up of dimensionless points or instants.

==Early work==
While time is a continuous quantity in both standard quantum mechanics and general relativity, many physicists have suggested that a discrete model of time might work, especially when considering the combination of quantum mechanics with general relativity to produce a theory of quantum gravity.

The term was introduced in this sense by Robert Lévi in 1927. A quantum theory in which time is a quantum variable with a discrete spectrum, and which is nevertheless consistent with special relativity, was proposed by Chen Ning Yang in 1947. Henry Margenau in 1950 suggested that the chronon might be the time for light to travel the classical radius of an electron.

==Work by Caldirola==
A prominent model was introduced by Piero Caldirola in 1980. In Caldirola&#x27;s model, one chronon corresponds to about 6.27 seconds for an electron. This is much longer than the Planck time, which is only about seconds. The Planck time may be postulated as a lower-bound on the length of time that could exist between two connected events, but it is not a quantization of time itself since there is no requirement that the time between two events be separated by a discrete number of Planck times. For example, ordered pairs of events (A, B) and (B, C) could each be separated by slightly more than 1 Planck time: this would produce a measurement limit of 1 Planck time between A and B or B and C, but a limit of 3 Planck times between A and C. The chronon is a quantization of the evolution in a system along its world line. Consequently, the value of the chronon, like other quantized observables in quantum mechanics, is a function of the system under consideration, particularly its boundary conditions. The value for the chronon, &quot;θ&quot;0, is calculated as
: formula_1
From this formula, it can be seen that the nature of the moving particle being considered must be specified, since the value of the chronon depends on the particle&#x27;s charge and mass.

Caldirola claims that the chronon has important implications for quantum mechanics, in particular that it allows for a clear answer to the question of whether a free-falling charged particle does or does not emit radiation. This model supposedly avoids the difficulties met by Abraham–Lorentz&#x27;s and Dirac&#x27;s approaches to the problem and provides a natural explication of quantum decoherence.

<text>Fyrisån (, &quot;the Fyris river&quot;) is a river in the Swedish province of Uppland, which passes through the city of Uppsala and ends in Lake Mälaren.

The &quot;Sala&quot; river in Uppland was changed in the 17th century in memory of the Fyrisvellir battle, mentioned in the Icelandic sagas, as it was the belief that the marshy plains called &quot;Föret&quot; was the site of the famous Battle of Fýrisvellir in the late 10th century. 

Boats can sail up the river from Lake Mälaren all the way to central Uppsala where two weirs make further progress impossible. In the summer of 2007, the construction of a fish ladder began to enable the asp, an endangered and potamodromous fish, to pass the weirs and reach its spawning waters. On the last day of April every year, during The Uppsala River Rafting Event, students attempt to navigate the weirs on homemade rafts with predictable results.

<doc id="1165256" wikidata="Q591573" url="?curid=1165256" title="Famitsu">
<text>, formerly , is a line of Japanese video game magazines published by Kadokawa Game Linkage (previously known as Gzbrain), a subsidiary of Kadokawa. &quot;Famitsu&quot; is published in both weekly and monthly formats as well as in the form of special topical issues devoted to only one console, video game company, or other theme. the original &quot;Famitsu&quot; publication, is considered the most widely read and respected video game news magazine in Japan. From October 28, 2011, the company began releasing the digital version of the magazine exclusively on BookWalker weekly.

The name &quot;Famitsu&quot; is a portmanteau abbreviation of &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;; the word &quot;Famicom&quot; itself comes from a portmanteau abbreviation of &quot;Family Computer&quot; (released overseas as the Nintendo Entertainment System), the dominant video game console in Japan when the magazine was first published in the 1980s.

==History==

, a computer game magazine, started in 1982 as an extra issue of &quot;ASCII&quot;, and later it became a periodic magazine. was a column in &quot;Login&quot;, focused on the Famicom platform, and ran from March 1985 to December 1986 issue. It received a good reception, so the publisher decided to found the magazine specialized for it.

The first issue of &quot;Famitsu&quot; was published on June 6, 1986, as &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;. It sold less than 200,000 copies, despite 700,000 copies printed. The major competitor was &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot; launched in July 1985 by Tokuma Shoten. &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s editor found many readers had multiple game consoles, and they thought it would be better if the magazine covered various platforms. Increasing contents and the page count gradually, the magazine was published three times per month instead of semimonthly publication. On July 19, 1991 (issue #136) the magazine was renamed to and issues were published weekly thereafter. Alongside the weekly magazine, a monthly version called was also published.

Hirokazu Hamamura, an editor-in-chief (1992–2002), felt the beginning of a new era when he saw a private demonstration of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in 1993. He thought the name &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; should be refurbished. At the start of 1996 (with issue #369) the magazines underwent another name change, truncating their titles to and v The name &quot;Famitsu&quot; had already been in common use.

The magazine was published by ASCII from its founding through March 2000 when it was sold to Enterbrain, which published it for 13 years, until their parent company Kadokawa published it from 2013 to 2017. Since 2017, Kadokawa&#x27;s subsidiary Gzbrain has been publishing the magazine, while in 2019 the company changed its name to Kadokawa Game Linkage.

==&quot;Shūkan Famitsū&quot; and &quot;Gekkan Famitsū&quot;==
&quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; initially focused on the Famicom platform, but later it featured multi-platform coverage. &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; was renamed to &quot;Famitsu&quot; in 1995. &quot;Shūkan Famitsū&quot; is a weekly publication concentrating on video game news and reviews, and is published every Thursday with a circulation of 500,000 per issue. &quot;Gekkan Famitsū&quot; is published monthly.

===Necky the Fox===
&quot;Famitsu&quot; covers alternately feature pop idols or actresses on even-numbered issues and the &quot;Famitsu&quot; mascot, the Fox in odd-numbered issues. Year-end and special editions all feature Necky dressed as popular contemporary video game characters. Necky is the cartoon creation of artist Susumu Matsushita, and he takes the form of a costumed fox. The costumes worn by Necky reflect current popular video games. Necky&#x27;s name was chosen according to a reader poll, and it derives from a complex Japanese pun: &quot;Necky&quot; is actually the reverse of the Japanese word for fox, and his original connection to &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; is intended to evoke the bark of the fox, the Japanese onomatopoeia of which is . Necky makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;.

Franchises with multiple perfect score winners include &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; with five titles, &quot;Metal Gear&quot; with three titles, and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; with two titles. The most recent game to receive a perfect score is &quot;Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&quot;.

<doc id="1165261" wikidata="Q7127054" url="?curid=1165261" title="Pale (album)">
<text>Pale is the second album by American alternative rock band Toad the Wet Sprocket. It was recorded independently in 1989 for roughly $6000. During the recording of &quot;Pale&quot;, the band signed with Columbia Records. However, they declined to re-record any of the album in a more polished way. Columbia released the album without alterations, as it had done with the 1989 re-release of their debut 1988 album &quot;Bread &amp; Circus&quot;. &quot;Pale&quot; was released in January 1990. &quot;Come Back Down&quot; was the first radio single for the album.

In May 2009, the band announced plans to re-release &quot;Pale&quot;, out of print since 2001, in a remastered edition with expanded artwork and bonus tracks culled from the album sessions that didn&#x27;t make it onto the album. Their debut, &quot;Bread &amp; Circus&quot; would also get the same kind of re-issue. In 2010 the band signed a deal with Primary Wave to handle their back catalog and licensing. These reissues had been confirmed by lead singer Glen Phillips via Toad&#x27;s &quot;Fan Questions&quot; portion of their official website for release in 2011, but never occurred. Instead, a remastered vinyl LP reissue of &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;Dulcinea&quot; were released in 2018 through the band&#x27;s online store.

<doc id="1165269" wikidata="Q2992409" url="?curid=1165269" title="Confederation of British Industry">
<text>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is a British business interest group, which says it represents 190,000 businesses. The CBI has been described by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as &quot;Britain&#x27;s biggest business lobby group&quot;. Incorporated by royal charter, its mission is to promote the conditions in which businesses of all sizes and sectors in the UK can compete and prosper for the benefit of all. In 2023, the association was shaken by numerous accusations of sexual misconduct in the organisation.

== Membership ==
The CBI&#x27;s membership includes companies from the FTSE 100, mid-caps, SMEs, privately owned businesses, trade associations, universities and other public bodies. The CBI has members in many sectors: agriculture, automotive, aerospace, construction, creative, education, financial services, IT, manufacturing, professional services, retail, transport, tourism and utilities.

The CBI is made up of around 1,500 direct members and 188,500 non-members. The non-members are represented through 140 trade associations within the confederation, for whose memberships the CBI also asserts representation, but which are not involved in the CBI&#x27;s policy formulation. The National Farmers&#x27; Union, with 55,000 members, is the largest component of the 188,500 non-members the CBI says it represents. The Country Land and Business Association brings another 30,000 non-members, the Freight Transport Association 13,000, the Federation of Master Builders 9,500, the Road Haulage Association 8,100 and the National Federation of Builders 1,400.

==Role==
The CBI works to promote business interests by lobbying and advising governments, networking with other businesses and creating intelligence through analysis of government policies and compilation of statistics, both in the United Kingdom and internationally through their offices in Beijing, Brussels, New Delhi and Washington, D.C.

The organisation is non-partisan and has sought legal advice to ensure neutrality.

==Structure==
The most recent Director-General was Tony Danker, who assumed the role on 30 November 2020, but had to step aside after misconduct allegations in March 2023, with Matthew Fell being appointed on an interim basis. Danker&#x27;s dismissal was announced on 11 April 2023. His successor is Rain Newton-Smith, previously chief economist at the CBI.

The CBI is governed by its royal charter and by the CBI Council, which is able to delegate many of its roles to the Chairs&#x27; Committee and Board. Final policy positions are mandated by the CBI Chairs&#x27; Committee, which has a seat for all of the chairs of its regional and national councils and subject-based policy standing committees, SME Council and Trade Association Council. The Chairs&#x27; Committee meets following each Standing Committee and Regional Council round.

The CBI&#x27;s strategic and financial decisions are decided on by the CBI Board, which is chaired by the CBI President and includes the support and guidance of 4 other non-executives. Day-to-day management of the CBI is in the hands of the Director-General supported by a Management Board, made up of a number of CBI directors.

A President&#x27;s Committee, made up of members, advises the president. The president, with the approval of the Chairs&#x27; Committee (under its delegated powers), appoints the director-general, who is responsible for the management of the CBI.

It has offices based in every region of the UK, including teams in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, along with offices in Washington D.C, New Delhi, Beijing and Brussels.

In September 2023, the CBI confirmed it was holding talks with Make UK about working together that could include a possible merger.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1965 out of a merger of the Federation of British Industries (known as FBI), the British Employers&#x27; Confederation and the National Association of British Manufacturers.

The CBI opened an office in Brussels in 1971, to open up opportunities in Europe. Other international offices have opened in Washington (2002), Beijing (2005) and New Delhi (2011).

In March 2014 it moved its headquarters from Centre Point, London, to offices in Cannon Place, located above Cannon Street railway station in the City of London.

=== Sexual misconduct scandal ===
In March 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on a sexual harassment complaint made against CBI director-general Tony Danker with additional allegations by other staff members. The CBI started an independent investigation, and Danker was replaced as head of the CBI by Matthew Fell, the organisation&#x27;s UK policy director, on an interim basis. In January 2024 it was announced that the CBI had settled on undisclosed terms an action for wrongful dismissal brought against it by Danker.

On 3 April 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a report with more than a dozen current and recent women employees of CBI alleging to have been victims of sexual misconduct, including one rape, independent of the previously reported Danker allegations. CBI expanded its investigation to include the new allegations and cancelled all future events, including its annual dinner. 

On 11 April 2023, the business group appointed its former Chief Economist Rain Newton-Smith as its new Director General, one month after she had left the CBI to join Barclays. 

On 21 April 2023, the &quot;Guardian&quot; reported that a second woman has said she was raped by CBI colleagues. On the same day, a number of major UK companies terminated their memberships with the CBI including Arup, Aviva, Phoenix Group, John Lewis, Mastercard, Virgin Media O2, Zurich Insurance Group, Ernst &amp; Young, NatWest, WPP plc, and BMW. Other major members of the CBI, including Barclays, HSBC, TSB, Lloyds Banking Group, Asda, Meta, Uber, PwC and many more announced they were pausing activities with the CBI pending the outcome of the investigation. The CBI has appointed law firm Fox Williams to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations. The group has suspended three employees pending the outcome of an investigation by Fox Williams.

In May 2023, the CBI announced that it had appointed Principia Advisory to assist it to &quot;identify the root causes of past failure, and recommend the changes required for cultural renewal and rebuilding trust&quot;. The CBI conducted a poll asking its members the question: &quot;Do the changes we have made − and the commitments we have set out − to reform our governance, culture, and purpose give you the confidence you need to support the CBI?&quot; The result, announced on 6 June 2023, was that 93% of its members voted in favour of continuing to support the organisation; however it later became known that turnout was only 28%, so fewer than a third of members voted in support.

In September 2023, it was reported that the CBI was seeking around £3 million from its members within days of its Annual General Meeting in order to avoid &#x27;financial oblivion&#x27;. On 20 September the organisation&#x27;s AGM was meant to be held. It was announced the day prior that this would be postponed until further notice.

In September 2023, it was reported that the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, had agreed to hold face-to-face talks with Rain Newton Smith ahead of the Chancellor&#x27;s Autumn Statement, set to be held in November. This news came five months after the Chancellor had claimed there was &#x27;no point&#x27; in engaging with the CBI following its recent scandals.

In March 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the CBI had used gagging clauses (non-disclosure agreements, NDAs) to prevent staff from discussing their sexual misconduct and bullying experiences at the organisation. The NDAs were accompanied by substantial financial settlements, with the total bill approaching £1m. The exodus of fee-paying members had made CBI&#x27;s financial situation precarious, forced it to lay off one-third of its 300 staff in a year.

Rupert Soames took up the position as the CBI&#x27;s new President in early 2024.

== Research ==
The CBI conducts numerous surveys that are of particular use to its members and stakeholders. Research is available to the relevant sections of its membership. The CBI&#x27;s surveys are currently:

* Industrial Trends
* Distributive Trends
* Service Sector
* Financial Sector
* SME Trends
* Investment Intentions
Occasional surveys include:
* Procurement
* London Business
* Education and Skills
* Absence
* Employment Trends

CBI policy is decided through consultation with its members – companies from all sectors and sizes of business across the UK are directly involved in the policy-making process. The CBI publishes numerous reports each year on a wide range of issues that of interest and relevance to its members. Recent campaigns include &quot;Future Champions&quot;, promoting the contribution and role of mid-sized businesses, &quot;Industrial Futures&quot;, looking at how government should intervene in the economy to promote growth, and a report on the need to strengthen UK supply chains published in 2014.

The CBI publishes &quot;Business Voice&quot;, a monthly magazine for its membership and &#x27;Intelligence FIRST&#x27;, an occasional publication providing strategic guidance for members on regulatory and economic change.

== The Great Business Debate ==
In September 2014, the CBI started &quot;The Great Business Debate&quot; campaign aimed at increasing public confidence in business. Survey data found that only around 50% of people in the UK think that business contributes positively to society and the campaign was initiated to play a part in increasing that figure. A website and social media channels have been set up to openly promote the contribution business makes whilst enabling people and organisations to give their opinions on this. It is planned that various events and other occurrences will take place across the UK as part of the campaign.

<doc id="1165271" wikidata="Q1889378" url="?curid=1165271" title="The Red Shoes (album)">
<text>The Red Shoes is the seventh studio album by English musician Kate Bush. Released on 1 November 1993, it was accompanied by Bush&#x27;s short film, &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve&quot;, and was her last album before a 12-year hiatus. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. In the United States, the album reached number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, her highest-peaking album on the chart at the time.

==Overview==
&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; was inspired by the 1948 film of the same name by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, which itself was inspired by the fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. It concerns a dancer, possessed by her art, who cannot take off the eponymous shoes and find peace.

Bush had suggested she might tour in support of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and deliberately aimed for a &quot;live band&quot; feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums (which would be difficult to recreate on stage). The tour did not materialise.

This was a troubled time for Bush, who had suffered a series of bereavements including the loss of her mother, Hannah, who died in 1992 and the death of her favoured guitarist, Alan Murphy. Bush&#x27;s long-term relationship with bassist Del Palmer had ended, although the pair continued to work together. &quot;I&#x27;ve been very affected by these last two years&quot;, she remarked in late 1991. &quot;They&#x27;ve been incredibly intense years for me. Maybe not on a work level, but a lot has happened to me. I feel I&#x27;ve learnt a lot – and, yes, I think [my next album] is going to be quite different... I hope the people that are waiting for it feel it&#x27;s worth the wait.&quot;

Many of the people she lost are honoured on the ballad &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, as well as director Michael Powell, with whom she had discussed working shortly before his death in 1990. Composer and conductor Michael Kamen contributed a score for the song.

&quot;The Red Shoes&quot; featured more high-profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts. The track &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot; featured instrumental and vocal contributions from Prince as well as guest vocals from comedian Lenny Henry. Trio Bulgarka (who had contributed to &quot;The Sensual World&quot;) appeared on three songs: &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;, and &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;. &quot;And So Is Love&quot; features guitar work by Eric Clapton; Gary Brooker (from the band Procol Harum) and Jeff Beck also participated in the recording sessions.

A short film, &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve&quot;, written and directed by Bush, and starring herself and English actress Miranda Richardson, was released the same year. It featured six songs from the album: &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, &quot;And So Is Love&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Eat the Music&quot; and &quot;Lily&quot;. The first five were used as promo videos for the singles, though Bush recorded a separate video for the American release of &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; (though this video is intercut with clips from &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve&quot;). The film was nominated for the Long Form Music Video at the 1996 Grammy Awards.

In 1995, Bush received a Brit Award nomination for Best British Female Artist.

The album was recorded digitally, and Bush has since expressed regrets about the results of this, which is why she revisited seven of the songs using analogue tape for her 2011 album &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, as well as releasing a remastered version of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; in 2011, based on the master from an analogue backup tape.

In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including a new remaster &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.

Bush performed &quot;Lily&quot; and &quot;Top of the City&quot; live for the first time in 2014 as part of the Before the Dawn concert residency.

In April 2024, the previous lead single &quot;Eat the Music&quot; was re-released on a 10&quot; vinyl record for Record Store Day, featuring B-sides &quot;Lily&quot; and &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; from the original album. The song charted at No. 77 on the UK Singles Midweek Update dated 22 April 2024.

==Critical reception==

Chris Roberts, writing for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, praised &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; as &quot;an utter masterpiece&quot; and felt that, apart from the &quot;misguided&quot; &quot;Eat the Music&quot;, Bush is &quot;on form like the Bible is well-known&quot; with an album of &quot;heartbreakingly beautiful ballads&quot; and the rest &quot;sunrise and Santa Claus, miles of muses&quot;. Terry Staunton of &quot;NME&quot; considered the &quot;truly exceptional&quot; album to be Bush&#x27;s &quot;most personal to date, yet also her most accessible&quot;. He noted that it is &quot;a more mixed bag&quot; than the &quot;semi-thematic collections&quot; of her previous two albums, but added that the majority of the songs are &quot;link[ed] by a sense of loss, in particular the loss of love and loved ones&quot;, despite being &quot;often light-hearted musically&quot;.

<doc id="1165275" wikidata="Q834459" url="?curid=1165275" title="Ostracon">
<text>An ostracon (Greek: &quot;ostrakon&quot;, plural &quot;ostraka&quot;) is a piece of pottery, usually broken off from a vase or other earthenware vessel. In an archaeological or epigraphical context, &quot;ostraca&quot; refer to sherds or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful, and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as a convenient medium to write on for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases very long.

==Ostracism==
In Classical Athens, when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the shard of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was exiled for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term &quot;ostracism&quot;. Broken pottery shards were also used for anal hygiene. Scholars have suggested that shards from a vote may have been re-used for this purpose, to curse the exiled individual by soiling their name.

==Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca==

Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available, and therefore frequently used for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students&#x27; exercises, and notes. Pottery sherds, limestone flakes, and thin fragments of other stone types were used, but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter colour, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink; but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the Story of Sinuhe.

The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost. These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries.

===Deir el-Medina Ostraca===

The 91 ostraca found at Deir el-Medina provide a deeply compelling view into the inner workings of the New Kingdom. These ostraca have shown medical and documentary records, some of which provide information on how water was provided, and how economic transactions were carried out. The extreme variety of information on ostraca that have been found presents information that would have been lost if not written down.

Like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of medical treatment, prayer, and magic. Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a “physician” who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a “scorpion charmer” who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings.

The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no “trained” intermediary. Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, with only a handful of ostraca containing prescriptions, indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician&#x27;s prescription, or to fulfill a home remedy.

Six people were assigned to Deir el-Medina as &quot;water carriers&quot; who were tasked to bring sacks of water to the village. Having a system in between a central cistern and door-to-door deliveries, the water carriers filled sacks and delivered them from the floodplain to a central location in the village where each household could receive a quarter to a half of a sack which would amount to ninety six to one hundred and fifteen liters of water per house. The typical household would have six residents, each would get fifteen to twenty liters of water for drinking. One ostracon describes how many of these deliveries were unfulfilled, where five people&#x27;s rations were undelivered, totaling to four and three quarters sacks or three hundred and seventy five liters of water gone undelivered. On multiple occasions, the citizens of Deir el-Medina attempted to dig a well, presumably due to their displacement toward the water carriers, but to no avail. The first attempt was during the fifteenth year of Ramesses III where a hole was dug twenty two meters into the ground, but with no luck. Before digging another, they established the water table sat at thirty one and a half meters, and in a desperate attempt they dug twenty meters past that, to fifty two meters, but again it was futile. With no water in the well, it was used as a dump where hundreds more ostraca were found.

Economics were unique in Deir el-Medina as transactions between people were closer to trades than modern transactions. Actual money would rarely change hands, as it was more of a measure of worth for an object and when making a deal, trades between people would consider both the worth of each ends of the trade and whether the items presented were needed. Conveniently, most ostraca found in Deir el-Medina were on economics and provide information on what these trades looked like. One such ostracon details a trade with one side offering an ox that was 120 Deben and the other offering two jars of fat, five smooth cloth tunics, one thin cloth kilt, and one hide which when put altogether were 130 Deben.

===Saqqara Dream Ostraca===
From 1964 to 1971, Bryan Emery excavated at Saqqara in search of Imhotep&#x27;s tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered. Apparently it was a pilgrimage site, with as many as 1½ million ibis birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims.

Emery&#x27;s excavations uncovered the &quot;Dream Ostraca&quot;, created by a scribe named &quot;Hor of Sebennytos.&quot; A devotee of the god Thoth, he lived adjacent to Thoth&#x27;s sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a &quot;proto-therapist&quot;, advising and comforting clients. He transferred his divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 Demotic texts written on pottery and limestone.

==Biblical period ostraca==
Famous ostraca for Biblical archaeology have been found at:
* Arad, Israel, or Tel Arad
* Lachish
* Mesad Hashavyahu
* Ostraca House at Samaria
* Elah Fortress at Khirbet Qeiyafa
Additionally, the lots drawn at Masada are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found.

In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, discovered what he says to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an ostracon sherd; Garfinkel believes this sherd dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave, and judge have been translated. 
The sherd was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.

<doc id="1165276" wikidata="Q3211241" url="?curid=1165276" title="Night of January 16th">
<text>Night of January 16th (sometimes advertised as The Night of January 16th) is a theatrical play by Russian-born American writer Ayn Rand, inspired by the death of Swedish industrialist Ivar Kreuger. The play is set in a courtroom during a murder trial, and an unusual feature is that members of the audience are chosen to play the jury. The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner who is accused of his murder. The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner&#x27;s death; instead the jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty. The play&#x27;s ending depends on the verdict. Rand&#x27;s intention was to dramatize a conflict between individualism and conformity, with the jury&#x27;s verdict revealing which viewpoint they preferred.

The play was first produced in 1934 in Los Angeles under the title Woman on Trial; it received mostly positive reviews and enjoyed moderate commercial success. Producer Al Woods took it to Broadway during the 1935–36 season and re-titled it &quot;Night of January 16th&quot;. It drew attention for its innovative audience-member jury and became a hit, running for seven months. Doris Nolan, in her Broadway debut, received positive reviews for her portrayal of the lead role. Several regional productions followed. An off-Broadway revival in 1973, under the title Penthouse Legend, was a commercial and critical failure. A film based on the play was released in 1941; the story has also been adapted for television and radio.

Rand had many heated disputes with Woods over script changes he wanted for the Broadway production. Their disputes climaxed in an arbitration hearing when Rand discovered Woods had diverted a portion of her royalties to pay for a script doctor. Rand disliked the changes made for the Broadway production and the version published for amateur productions, so in 1968 she re-edited the script for publication as the &quot;definitive&quot; version.

==History==
===Background and first production===

Rand drew inspiration for &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; from two sources. The first was &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot;, a 1927 melodrama about a showgirl prosecuted for killing her wealthy lover, which gave Rand the idea to write a play featuring a trial. Rand wanted her play&#x27;s ending to depend on the result of the trial, rather than having a fixed final scene. She based her victim on Swedish industrialist Ivar Kreuger, who was known as the &quot;Match King&quot; for the matchstick-manufacturing monopolies he owned. When Kreuger&#x27;s business empire became financially unstable, he shot himself on March 12, 1932 after being accused of involvement in potentially illegal financial deals. The incident inspired Rand to make the victim a businessman of great ambition and dubious character, who had given several people motives for his murder.

Rand wrote &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; in 1933. She was 28 and had been in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist opinions had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios&#x27; wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, &quot;Red Pawn&quot;, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, &quot;We the Living&quot;. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. &quot;Red Pawn&quot; was shelved and Rand&#x27;s contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand&#x27;s husband, actor Frank O&#x27;Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from &quot;Red Pawn&quot; exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot; for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.
Soon after she rejected the offer from Woods, Rand accepted an offer from Welsh actor E. E. Clive to stage the play in Los Angeles. It first opened at the Hollywood Playhouse as &quot;Woman on Trial&quot;; Clive produced, and Barbara Bedford played Andre. The production opened on October 22, 1934, and closed in late November.

===Broadway production===
At the end of the play&#x27;s run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed his offer to produce the play on Broadway. Although he was a renowned producer of many famous plays in a career of more than three decades, Woods had lost much of his fortune in the early 1930s and had not produced a hit in several years. Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms.

Rand arrived in New York City at the beginning of December 1934 in anticipation of the opening in January 1935. The play&#x27;s financing failed, delaying the production for several months until Woods arranged new financing from theater owner Lee Shubert. When work resumed, Rand&#x27;s relationship with Woods quickly soured as he demanded changes she later derided as &quot;a junk heap of worn, irrelevant melodramatic devices&quot;. Woods had made his success on Broadway with low-brow melodramas such as &quot;Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model&quot; and risqué comedies such as &quot;The Demi-Virgin&quot;. Woods was not interested in what he called Rand&#x27;s &quot;highfalutin speeches&quot;, preferring the dramatic conflict to focus on concrete elements, such as whether the defendant had a gun. The changes to Rand&#x27;s work included the creation of a new character, a gun moll played by Shubert&#x27;s mistress.

The contract between Woods and Rand allowed him to hire collaborators if he thought it necessary, paying them a limited portion of the author&#x27;s royalties. He first hired John Hayden to direct, paying him one percentage point from Rand&#x27;s 10-percent royalty. Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director, Rand disliked him and later called him &quot;a very ratty Broadway hanger-on&quot;. As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia, Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand&#x27;s refusal to make some of them. He engaged Louis Weitzenkorn, the author of the previous hit &quot;Five Star Final&quot;, to act as a script doctor. Rand&#x27;s relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse than hers with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another percentage point from Rand&#x27;s royalties without informing her. Rand filed a claim against Woods with the American Arbitration Association; she objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties, and told the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play, which was cut after the auditions. Upon hearing this testimony, one of the arbitrators responded incredulously, &quot;That was he did?&quot; In two hearings, the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed-upon one percent, but that Woods could not deduct the payment from Rand&#x27;s royalties because she had not been notified in advance. Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert&#x27;s Ambassador Theatre on September 16, 1935, where it ran successfully for seven months. It closed on April 4, 1936, after 283 performances.

===Subsequent productions and publications===

When the play&#x27;s success on Broadway was clear, Woods launched productions of the play in other cities, starting with San Francisco. It opened there at the Geary Theater on December 30, 1935, and ran for five weeks with Nedda Harrigan in the lead role. Harrigan stayed with the show when it moved to the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, where it opened on March 1, 1936. After the Broadway production closed, Woods started a road tour that included productions in Boston and Chicago.

International productions of the play included shows in London, Montreal, and Sydney. The production in London opened on September 29, 1936, where Phoebe Foster took the lead role for her first appearance on the London stage. It closed after 22 performances. A production in Montreal opened on June 16, 1941, starring Fay Wray as Andre and Robert Wilcox as Regan. In Sydney, the play opened at the Minerva Theatre on June 19, 1944, with Thelma Grigg as Andre.

&quot;Night of January 16th&quot; was first published in an edition for amateur theater organizations in 1936, using a version edited by drama professor Nathaniel Edward , which included further changes to eliminate elements such as swearing and smoking. Rand disavowed this version because of the changes. In 1960, Rand&#x27;s protégé Nathaniel Branden asked about doing a public reading of the play for students at the Nathaniel Branden Institute. Rand did not want him to use the amateur version; she created a revised text that eliminated most of Woods&#x27; and &#x27;s changes. She had her &quot;final, definitive version&quot; published in 1968 with an introduction about the play&#x27;s history.

In 1972, Rand approved an off-Broadway revival of the play, which used her preferred version of the script, including several dozen further small changes in language beyond those in the 1968 version. The revival also used her original title, &quot;Penthouse Legend&quot;. It was produced by Phillip and Kay Nolte Smith, a married couple who were friends with Rand. Kay Smith also starred in the production under the stage name Kay Gillian. It opened at the McAlpin Rooftop Theater on February 22, 1973, and closed on March 18 after 30 performances.

&quot;Night of January 16th&quot; was the last theatrical success for either Rand or Woods. Rand&#x27;s next play, &quot;Ideal&quot;, went unsold, and a 1940 stage adaptation of &quot;We the Living&quot; flopped. Rand achieved lasting success and financial stability with her 1943 novel, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Woods produced several more plays; none were hits and when he died in 1951, he was bankrupt and living in a hotel.

==Synopsis==
The plot of &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; centers on the trial of secretary Karen Andre for the murder of her employer, business executive Bjorn Faulkner, who defrauded his company of millions of dollars to invest in the gold trade. In the wake of a financial crash, he was facing bankruptcy. The play&#x27;s events occur entirely in a courtroom; Faulkner is never seen. On the night of January 16, Faulkner and Andre were in the penthouse of the Faulkner Building in New York City, when Faulkner apparently fell to his death. Within the three acts, the prosecutor Mr. Flint and Andre&#x27;s defense attorney Mr. Stevens call witnesses whose testimonies build conflicting stories.

At the beginning of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner&#x27;s secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner&#x27;s body was so damaged by the fall that it was impossible to determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner&#x27;s very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner&#x27;s marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner&#x27;s courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.
The second act continues the prosecution&#x27;s case, with Flint calling John Graham Whitfield—Faulkner&#x27;s father-in-law and president of Whitfield National Bank. He testifies about a large loan he made to Faulkner. In his cross-examination, defense attorney Stevens suggests the loan was used to buy Faulkner&#x27;s marriage to Whitfield&#x27;s daughter. After this testimony, the prosecution rests and the defense argument begins. A handwriting expert testifies about the signature on the suicide note. Faulkner&#x27;s bookkeeper describes events between Andre&#x27;s dismissal and the night of Faulkner&#x27;s death, and related financial matters. Andre takes the stand and describes her relationship with Faulkner as both his lover and his partner in financial fraud. She says she did not resent his marriage because it was a business deal to secure credit from the Whitfield Bank. As she starts to explain the reasons for Faulkner&#x27;s alleged suicide, she is interrupted by the arrival of &quot;Guts&quot; Regan, an infamous gangster, who tells Andre that Faulkner is dead. Despite being on trial for Faulkner&#x27;s murder, Andre is shocked by this news and faints.

The final act continues Andre&#x27;s testimony; she is now somber rather than defiant. She says that she, Faulkner, and Regan had conspired to fake Faulkner&#x27;s suicide so they could escape with money stolen from Whitfield. Regan, who was also in love with Andre, provided the stolen body of his already-dead gang associate, &quot;Lefty&quot; O&#x27;Toole, to throw from the building. In cross-examination, Flint suggests Andre and Regan were using knowledge of past criminal activities to blackmail Faulkner. Stevens then calls Regan, who testifies that he was due to meet Faulkner at a getaway plane after leaving the stolen body with Andre; however, Faulkner did not arrive and the plane was missing. Instead of Faulkner, Regan encountered Whitfield, who gave him a check that was, according to Regan, to buy his silence. Regan later found the missing plane, which had been burned with what he presumes is Faulkner&#x27;s body inside. Flint&#x27;s cross-examination offers an alternative theory: Regan put the stolen body into the plane to create doubt about Andre&#x27;s guilt, and the check from Whitfield was protection money to Regan&#x27;s gang. In the play&#x27;s Broadway and amateur versions, the next witness is Roberta Van Rensselaer, an exotic dancer and wife of O&#x27;Toole, who believes Regan killed her husband. This character does not appear in Rand&#x27;s preferred version of the play. Stevens then recalls two witnesses to follow up on issues from Regan&#x27;s testimony. The defense and prosecution then give their closing arguments.

The jury retires to vote while the characters repeat highlights from their testimony under a spotlight. The jury then returns to announce its verdict. One of two short endings follows. If found not guilty, Andre thanks the jury. If found guilty, she says the jury have spared her from committing suicide. In Reeid&#x27;s amateur version, after either verdict the judge berates the jurors for their bad judgment and declares that they cannot serve on a jury again.

==Title==

Although best known as &quot;Night of January 16th&quot;, the play&#x27;s title changed multiple times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand&#x27;s working title was &quot;Penthouse Legend&quot;. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand&#x27;s title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called &quot;The Verdict&quot; during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title &quot;Woman on Trial&quot;. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between &quot;The Black Sedan&quot; and &quot;Night of January 16th&quot;. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play &quot;The Night is Young&quot;. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.

When Rand published her version of the play in 1968, she wrote that although she disliked the Broadway title, it was too well known to change it again. She agreed to using &quot;Penthouse Legend&quot; as the title for the 1973 revival production.

==Broadway cast and characters==
The play&#x27;s protagonist and lead female role is the defendant, Karen Andre. Woods considered several actresses for the role, but with Rand&#x27;s support he cast an unusual choice, an actress named Doris Nolan. It was Nolan&#x27;s Broadway debut; her previous professional acting experience was a failed attempt at completing a movie scene. At 17 years old, she was cast as a presumably older femme fatale. Woods was Nolan&#x27;s manager and got a commission from her contract. Nolan was inexperienced and was nervous throughout rehearsals. When other actresses visited, she feared they were there to replace her. Although Rand later said she was &quot;not a sensational actress&quot;, reviewers praised her performance. Nolan left the cast in March to take a movie contract from Universal Studios.

Rand actively pushed for Walter Pidgeon to be cast in the role of &quot;Guts&quot; Regan. Woods objected at first, but eventually gave Pidgeon the part. As with Nolan, reviewers approved the choice. Pidgeon left the production after about a month to take a role in another play, &quot;There&#x27;s Wisdom in Women&quot;. Despite Rand&#x27;s objections, he was replaced with William Bakewell; Rand recommended Morgan Conway, who played the same role in &quot;Woman on Trial&quot;.



==Dramatic analysis==
===Jury element===
The selection of a jury from the play&#x27;s audience was the primary dramatic innovation of &quot;Night of January 16th&quot;. It created concerns among many of the producers who considered and rejected the play. Although Woods liked the idea, Hayden worried it would destroy the theatrical illusion; he feared audience members might refuse to participate. Successful jury selections during previews indicated this would not be a problem. This criticism dissipated following the play&#x27;s success; it became famous for its &quot;jury gimmick&quot;.

The play&#x27;s jury has sometimes enlisted famous participants; the Broadway selections were rigged to call on celebrities known to be in the audience. The jury for the Broadway opening included attorney Edward J. Reilly—who was known from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial earlier that year—and boxing champion Jack Dempsey. At a special performance for the blind, Helen Keller sat on the jury. The practice of using celebrity jurors continued throughout the Broadway run and in other productions.

Woods decided the jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service rules of the New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the selected audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.

===Themes===
Rand described &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; as &quot;a sense-of-life play&quot;. She did not want its events to be taken literally, but to be understood as a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury&#x27;s decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre &quot;not guilty&quot;. She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: &quot;Your life, your achievement, your happiness, are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man&#x27;s most admirable quality&quot;. She said the play &quot;is not a philosophical treatise on morality&quot; and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called &quot;Objectivism&quot;, particularly in her 1957 novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and in non-fiction essays, but &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; predates these more philosophical works.

Several later commentators have interpreted the play as a reflection of Rand&#x27;s early interest in the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche&#x27;s morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who &quot;never thought of things as right or wrong&quot;. Others found significance in Rand&#x27;s admiration of the play&#x27;s criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand &quot;found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism&quot; because of the influence on her of &quot;Nietzsche&#x27;s transvaluation of values [that] changed criminals into heroes&quot;. Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; she said a criminal could serve as &quot;an eloquent symbol&quot; of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, &quot;I do not think, nor did I think when I wrote this play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain&quot;. Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play&#x27;s promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play &quot;a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview&quot; of the superiority of the &quot;superman&quot;; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the &quot;slave morality&quot; of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand &quot;later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals&quot;, making the characters&#x27; criminality an embarrassment for her.

==Reception==
Since its premiere, &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; has had a mixed reception. The initial Los Angeles run as &quot;Woman on Trial&quot; received complimentary reviews; Rand was disappointed that reviews focused on the play&#x27;s melodrama and its similarity to &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot;, while paying little attention to aspects she considered more important, such as the contrasting ideas of individualism and conformity. Although Rand later described the production as &quot;badly handicapped by lack of funds&quot; and &quot;competent, but somewhat unexciting&quot;, it performed reasonably well at the box office during its short run.

The Broadway production received largely positive reviews that praised its melodrama and the acting of Nolan and Pidgeon. &quot;Commonweal&quot; described it as &quot;well constructed, well enough written, admirably directed ... and excellently acted&quot;. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; said the action came in &quot;fits and starts&quot;, but praised the acting and the novelty of the use of a jury. &quot;New York Post&quot; critic John Mason Brown said the play had some flaws, but was an exciting, above-average melodrama. Brooks Atkinson gave it a negative review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, calling it &quot;the usual brew of hokum&quot;. A review from &quot;Theatre Arts Monthly&quot; was also dismissive, calling the play a &quot;fashionable game&quot; that would be &quot;fun in a parlor&quot; but seemed &quot;pretty foolish&quot; on stage. Some reviews focused on Woods as the source of the play&#x27;s positive attributes because he had had many previous theatrical successes. &quot;Time&quot; said Woods was repeating a successful formula from &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot;. Reviews that praised these elements were an embarrassment to Rand, who considered Woods&#x27; changes to be negative. Again, reviewers ignored the broader themes that Rand considered important.

Professional productions in other North American cities typically received positive reviews. Austin B. Fenger described the production at San Francisco&#x27;s Geary Theater as &quot;darned good theater&quot; that was &quot;well acted&quot; and &quot;crisply written&quot;. Charles Collins said the Chicago production was &quot;a first class story&quot; that was &quot;well acted by an admirably selected cast&quot;. Thomas Archer&#x27;s review of the Montreal production described it as &quot;realistic&quot; and &quot;absorbing&quot;.

The London production in 1936 received mostly positive reviews but was not a commercial success. A reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; praised Foster&#x27;s performance as &quot;tense and beautiful&quot;. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, reviewer W. A. Darlington said the show would be popular with audiences, but the production ended its run in less than a month. The review in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; described it as a &quot;strong, quick thriller&quot;, but with inferior dialog to &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Spectator&quot; was more critical, saying the play itself was &quot;strong&quot;, but was undermined by &quot;mediocre playing&quot; from &quot;bad actors&quot;.

The 1973 revival as &quot;Penthouse Legend&quot; was a failure and received strongly negative reviews. A reviewer for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; complimented the story&#x27;s melodramatic plot twists but said it was &quot;preposterously badly written&quot; and described the production as &quot;conventional and obvious&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Clive Barnes called the play tedious and said the acting was &quot;not particularly good&quot;. It closed within a few weeks.

Academics and biographers reviewing the play have also expressed mixed opinions. Theater scholar Gerald Bordman declared it &quot;an unexceptional courtroom drama&quot; made popular by the jury element, although he noted praise for the acting of Breese and Pidgeon. Historian James Baker described Rand&#x27;s presentation of courtroom behavior as unrealistic, but said audiences forgive this because the play&#x27;s dramatic moments are &quot;so much fun&quot;. He said the play was &quot;great entertainment&quot; that is &quot;held together by an enormously attractive woman and a gimmick&quot;, but &quot;it is not philosophy&quot; and fails to convey the themes Rand had in mind. Jennifer Burns expressed a similar view, stating that the play&#x27;s attempts to portray individualism had &quot;dubious results ... Rand intended Bjorn Faulkner to embody heroic individualism, but in the play he comes off as little more than an unscrupulous businessman with a taste for rough sex&quot;. Literature scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein described the play as &quot;significant for dramatic ingenuity and thematic content&quot;. Rand biographer Anne Heller considered it &quot;engaging, if stilted&quot;, while Ronald Merrill described it as &quot;a skillfully constructed drama&quot; undercut by &quot;Rand&#x27;s peculiar inability to write an effective mystery plot without leaving holes&quot;. Mystery critic Marvin Lachman noted the novelty of the use of a jury but called the play unrealistic with &quot;stilted dialogue&quot; and &quot;stereotypical characters&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Movies===
The movie rights to &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; were initially purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in October 1934 as a possible vehicle for Loretta Young. They hired Rand to write a screenplay, but the project was scrapped. After MGM&#x27;s option expired, Woods considered making a movie version through a production company of his own, but in 1938 RKO Pictures bought the rights for $10,000 (), a fee split between Woods and Rand. RKO considered Claudette Colbert and Lucille Ball as possible stars, but they also gave up on the adaptation. The rights were resold to Paramount Pictures in July 1939 for $35,000 (). Paramount released a movie in 1941; Rand did not participate in the production. The film was directed by William Clemens, and Delmer Daves, Robert Pirosh, and Eve Greene were engaged to prepare a new screenplay.

The new screenplay altered the plot significantly, focusing on Steve Van Ruyle (Robert Preston), a sailor who inherits a position on the board of a company headed by Bjorn Faulkner (Nils Asther). Unlike the play, in which Faulkner is already dead, he appears in the film as a living character who is apparently murdered. Suspicion falls on Faulkner&#x27;s secretary Kit Lane (Ellen Drew); Van Ruyle decides to investigate the alleged crime. Faulkner is discovered hiding in Cuba after faking his own death. Rand said only a single line from her original dialog appeared in the movie, which she dismissed as a &quot;cheap, trashy vulgarity&quot;. The film received little attention when it was released, and most reviews of it were negative.

In 1989, &quot;Gawaahi&quot;, a Hindi-language adaptation of &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; was released. Indian actress Zeenat Aman led a cast that included Shekhar Kapur and Ashutosh Gowariker.

===Television and radio===
&quot;Night of January 16th&quot; was adapted for several television anthology series in the 1950s and 1960s. The first was WOR-TV&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot;, which aired its adaptation on July 14, 1952, with a cast that included Neil Hamilton and Virginia Gilmore. On CBS, the &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; presented a version of &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; on May 10, 1956, starring Phyllis Thaxter as Andre. In the United Kingdom, Maxine Audley took the lead role for an &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; broadcast on January 12, 1960; Cec Linder played the district attorney. The broadcast had been scheduled for October 6, 1959, but was delayed to avoid its possible interpretation as political commentary before the general election held later that week. A radio adaptation of the play was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on August 4, 1962.

<text>Didcot Railway Centre is a railway museum and preservation engineering site in Didcot, Oxfordshire, England. The site was formerly a Great Western Railway engine shed and locomotive stabling point.

==Background==
The founders and commercial backers of the Great Western Railway  (GWR) supported Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s scheme to develop an integrated railway and steamship service which allowed trans-Atlantic passengers and freight quicker passage between London and New York City. However, whilst backing the scheme the railway had to make a profit, and so it took a number of detours and added both mainline and branch line traffic to increase its domestic earnings. This earned the railway the nickname &quot;The Great Way Round&quot; from its detractors.

Whilst the route from London Paddington to Reading was relatively straight, the then obvious most direct route to Bristol would have taken the railway further south, thus avoiding both Didcot and Swindon. However, passenger and freight traffic both to and from Oxford and onwards to the West Midlands in part dictated a more northerly route. Also, Brunel had originally planned to cut through Savernake Forest near Marlborough, Wiltshire to Bristol, but the Marquess of Ailesbury, who owned the land, objected – having previously objected to part of the Kennet and Avon Canal running through his estate (see Bruce Tunnel). With the railway needing to run near to a canal at its midpoint – as it was cheaper to transport coal for trains along canals at this time – and with the need for the branch northwards to Cheltenham via Stroud, Swindon was the next logical choice for the junction (and later railway works), north of the original route. This dictated that the Oxford junction also be moved northwards, and hence via Didcot. The Great Western Railway built the first rail line through Didcot in 1839 and opened its first station in 1844.

===Construction===

Due to the technical operational difficulties of running and maintaining a mainline service from London to Bristol, as well as the need for servicing locomotives going to Oxford, Didcot became an obvious midpoint maintenance and stabling point. Having built a timber-framed broad gauge shed on the original site during the railway&#x27;s development west in the 1800s, in June 1932 a new steel-framed half-brick 4-road through shed (), was completed by the GWR under the Loans and Guarantees Act (1929). With shed code DID, it also included a repair shop (), coaling stage (), sand furnace () and turntable and associated offices (). During World War II, a standard steel-framed with corrugated iron-panel covered ash shelter was erected: this was dismantled in early GWS days.

===Operations===
After World War II, the site remained virtually unchanged during the nationalised ownership of British Railways (BR), but for taking on the new code of 81E. The standard allocation of locomotives remained the same, with Halls, Dukedogs and Panniers making up the bulk of the depot&#x27;s fleet.

===Closure===
With the replacement of steam with diesel traction under the Modernisation Plan, the shed became redundant and was closed in June 1965.

==Formation and site lease==
The Great Western Society (GWS) was offered the use of the former Didcot locomotive depot, taking it over in 1967. In the 1970s, the society negotiated a long-term lease with BR which was to expire in 2019. But this was subject to a six-month termination clause which could force the GWS to quit the site, and which could be operated at any point in time by lease-holder Network Rail (NR).

In an attempt to secure a long-term future for the society, in 2002 the GWS opened negotiations with NR to either purchase the site or extend the lease. In a letter dated May 2007, NR informed the GWS that they were prepared to sell the site subject to Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) approval. It had been thought the site could be subject to need as a depot, either due to: the rebuilding of Reading station; a Crossrail project depot; or the Intercity Express Programme. After expressing some concern at the slow speed of negotiations at the GWS annual meeting in September 2008, NR wrote to the GWS to advise that the site was no longer available for sale, and although a lease extension was still on offer it was still subject to the previous six-month termination clause. The GWS then wrote to their local MP Ed Vaizey, and placed any long-term development plans on hold. Richard Croucher (Chairman of the Great Western Society) signed a new 50-year lease with Network Rail, therefore preserving the site for at least another 50 years.

==Museum and railway centre==


Today the GWS have developed the site, which still retains many of the original GWR buildings and features, as both a working steam locomotive and railway museum, engineering maintenance centre, and railway line offering short rides to visitors.

Access via Didcot Parkway station brings the visitor into the southern end of the site, at the start of the ramp coal wagons would take up to the coaling stage. Beyond this is the original 1932 four-road engine shed, and beyond this the original repair shed and 1988 constructed locomotive works, both of which have restricted access due to safety concerns. Beyond this lies a Ransomes &amp; Rapier turntable, originally built for the Southern Railway at Southampton Docks, installed in the original pit.

The centre regularly holds events such as steam and diesel railcar days. Members of the Great Western Society have been active in the preservation of locomotives and rolling stock. Certain &#x27;new-build&#x27; projects to create locomotives that did not escape wholesale scrapping have also been undertaken at Didcot, such as the completed Firefly locomotive, a &#x27;Saint&#x27; class (using a &#x27;Hall&#x27; class chassis and boiler) and a &#x27;County&#x27; class locomotive (using a &#x27;Hall&#x27; class chassis and an LMS &#x27;8F&#x27; class boiler).

There is a small relics museum and archive on site, operated by the Great Western Trust.

The Railway Centre has been used as a period film set and has featured in productions including &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, and &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;.

===Running lines===
There are three short lengths of running track, each with a station at both ends:
====Branchline====
This starts at a typical GWR wayside halt, named Didcot Halt, and runs north on the western edge of the site to a platform, named Burlescombe Station, at the transshipment shed. Dating from broad gauge days, the shed was used for transferring goods from broad to &quot;narrow&quot; (i.e. ) rolling stock and vice versa. It was moved to its present location carefully from its original site nearby.
====Broad Gauge Line====
The broad gauge line of starts from the transshipment shed, and runs halfway back down the branchline. The 2005 replica GWR &quot;Fire Fly&quot; is housed within the shed when not running
====Mainline====
Starting from the Main Line Platform opposite the site entrance, using a pre-fabricated concrete station platform from , this runs on the eastern edge of the site to a newly built platform, named Oxford Road Station, near the transshipment shed. The reconstruction of the Brunel-designed building from station on this platform has been commenced.
==Access==

The railway centre is entirely surrounded by active railway lines and has no road connection of any kind. Public access is on foot from a subway at Didcot Parkway station, which links the centre by rail to London and much of southern and central England. Wheelchair and pram access has been difficult due to the presence of a flight of concrete steps on Network Rail property. To comply fully with the Disability Discrimination Act, the Great Western Society constructed a ramped access in 2023–24.
==Collection==

===Steam locomotives===
===Diesel locomotives===
Including other non-steam powered vehicles
===Other rolling stock===
The GWS has an extensive supporting collection of GWR rolling stock, including three of the GWR Super Saloons that serviced the boat train traffic to Plymouth. In addition it has some vehicles for staff and maintenance use.
====Carriages====
====Broad Gauge replica carriages====
====Non-passenger-carrying coaching stock====

====Wagons====

<doc id="1165282" wikidata="Q701138" url="?curid=1165282" title="Naming customs of Taiwanese indigenous peoples">
<text>The naming customs of [[ Indigenous Taiwanese]] are distinct from, though influenced by, the majority Han Chinese culture of Taiwan. Prior to contact with Han Chinese, the Indigenous Taiwanese named themselves according to each tribe&#x27;s tradition. The naming system varies greatly depending on the particular tribes. Some tribes do not have family names, at least as part of the personal name.

Under the strong influence of Chinese culture and forces of cultural assimilation brought by Han settlers in the 17th century, the Indigenous Taiwanese have gradually adopted Han names. In the 17th and 18th centuries, possession of a Han surname was considered to be a sign of being civilized, in part because adoption of a Han surname meant that that person was now entered into the population registration books and could be taxed. Upon possessing a Han surname, most of the lowland Indigenous tribes assimilated with the Han immigrants, and eventually no longer saw themselves or were seen as a distinct population.

The handful of highland tribes generally kept separate names until after World War II when the government systematically assigned Han names to Indigenous Taiwanese. Aboriginal Taiwanese people settled near Hakka communities were sometimes assigned Hakka-like family names. For instance, Indigenous pop singer A-mei (張惠妹) may have a name with Hakka characteristics.

For a few decades in the first half of the 20th century under Japanese rule, a strict policy was put in place to quickly assimilate the island&#x27;s inhabitants en masse by instituting Japanese names. These names were generally abandoned in Taiwan after 1945 when Japanese rule ended.

In the last two decades some Indigenous Taiwanese people have again taken up traditional names or chosen to emphasize them. However, few have abandoned their Han names, in part because the Austronesian names are difficult for non-Indigenous people to remember or pronounce. As a legacy of the anti-romanisation policy of the past, even these names are often written in Chinese characters to mimic their native sounds, even though Formosan languages are typically written in the Latin alphabet.

== Indigenous names ==
The naming rules of Indigenous Taiwanese:
== Examples ==
* Walis Nokan, Atayal, a famous aboriginal activist and poet.
* Walis Perin, Seediq, minister of the Council of Indigenous Peoples.
* Ciwas Ali, Atayal name of Kao Chin Su-mei, a singer, actress and politician.
* Gulilai Amit, a.k.a. A-mei, an ethnic Puyuma pop singer.
* Attun Palalin, a.k.a. Teruo Nakamura, a Taiwan-born soldier of the Imperial Japanese Army who fought for Japan in World War II and did not surrender until 1974.

<text>Stephen John Shutt (born July 1, 1952) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and NHL Hall of Famer who played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), 12 seasons for the Montreal Canadiens and 1 season for the Los Angeles Kings. He is in the Hockey Hall of Fame. While playing for the Canadiens he captured 5 Stanley Cups in 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979.

==Playing career==
As a youth, he played in the 1964 and 1965 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with minor ice hockey teams from Toronto.

Partnered with Jacques Lemaire and Guy Lafleur on the Montreal Canadiens, to form the top line in the NHL, Shutt became the first left-winger in NHL history to score 60 goals in a single season, with the historic goal being scored on April 3, 1977, against the Washington Capitals.

During his career with Montreal, he was named to the NHL First All-Star team in 1977, and the NHL Second All-Star team in 1978 and 1980.

==Playing style==

Despite being of relatively small stature and possessing average skating ability, Shutt had remarkable spatial awareness and was very positionally sound. He was consistently able to get into dead areas of coverage on the ice, either by anticipating where the puck was going to be or by arriving late on a play.

He was also a masterful goal scorer, possessing a diverse arsenal of shots. His wrist shot was known for its superior accuracy, and Shutt was noted for his ability to consistently pick corners or hit the five-hole.

Moreover, Shutt was famous for the power and unusual level of accuracy found in his slap shot, which he could get off in full stride while coming down the wing. Shutt was frequently able to let fly one or two steps inside the offensive zone and beat goalies clean. New York Islanders goaltender Billy Smith, who faced the Habs many times in the 70s and 80s, gave credit to the superiority of Shutt&#x27;s slapshot:

“He had a great shot. Unbelievable shot. He’d come across the blue line and he could tee it up better than anybody. And he was accurate, which is scary for someone with a slap shot.”

In addition to having a superb slap shot on the fly, the precision and consistency of Shutt&#x27;s one timer also earned him a spot as the point man on the Habs’ power play over many of the defencemen on his team.

However, the most noteworthy part of Shutt&#x27;s game was his ability to collect rebounds and turn them into so-called “garbage goals”. As Shutt himself claimed, “I’m the only guy that could score goals and make it boring”. This particular element of Shutt&#x27;s playing style fit him into a long line of “garbage collectors” who earned a majority of their goals from around the crease – players like Nels Stewart and Gordie Drillon before him, his contemporary Phil Esposito and skaters of a later generation such as Corey Perry. He had exceptional hand-eye coordination, and a deft knack for converting loose pucks into deflections – even batting in pucks which had bounced one or two feet off the ice. Noted author and sports columnist Brian McFarlane claimed that Shutt had the fastest set of hands around the net during his time in the NHL, with an ability to corral the puck with his skates as well as protect it with his body and stick.
Shutt gave a simple explanation for how he developed his excellent reflexes as a child: “We always had about fifteen kids on the ice, and so there wasn’t a lot of room. And so you had to be really quick with your hands.”

==Career statistics==

==Post playing career==
Following his playing career, Shutt worked as a television hockey commentator. From 1993 to 1997, he worked on the Canadiens coaching staff as an assistant coach on both the staffs of Jacques Demers and Mario Tremblay.

Following his assistant coaching duties with the Montreal Canadiens, Shutt joined Toromont Industries as Manager of Recreational Facilities and Services and has been with them for the past 19 years.

On November 22, 2003, Shutt participated with the Canadiens&#x27; old-timers against the Edmonton Oilers oldtimers in the Heritage Classic, the first outdoor game in the history of the NHL played at Commonwealth Stadium, in Edmonton, Alberta. Shutt also tours Canada and the U.S. as a playing member of the Oldtimers&#x27; Hockey Challenge, raising money for charitable causes.

In North York, he was a middle school classmate of rock star and bassist Geddy Lee. The two connected over music, and they both picked up bass guitars, both being influenced by Denny Gerrard, the bassist of Toronto psychedelic rock band The Paupers. Lee credits Shutt with introducing him to his future Rush bandmate, guitarist Alex Lifeson.

<doc id="1165294" wikidata="Q1937258" url="?curid=1165294" title="Tougher Than Leather">
<text>Tougher Than Leather is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group Run-D.M.C., released on May 17, 1988, by Profile Records. The album was produced by the group members themselves, Davy D. and Rick Rubin.

While the new record did not maintain the same popularity as its predecessor, it obtained platinum status and spawned the favorites &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;. Despite being given a mixed reception at the time of its release, it is now hailed as a seminal classic in hip-hop and many see it as an underrated album.

&quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot; peaked at number 9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on July 19, 1988.

The album features three the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles: &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Going Out Like That&quot;. &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; also hit the UK Singles Chart.

The album was reissued by Arista Records in 1999 and 2003. An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2005 and contained 4 previously unreleased songs.

==Background==
The platinum-selling album, a follow-up to the group&#x27;s big commercial breakthrough album 1986&#x27;s Raising Hell, featured some of the group&#x27;s classics like &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Beats to the Rhyme&quot;, and a cover of The Monkees&#x27;s &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;. &quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot; was the group&#x27;s fourth effort and blended in elements of not only rap but also rock n&#x27; roll and funk, making it their most varied effort to date alongside &quot;King of Rock&quot;. &quot;Papa Crazy&quot; is based on &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; by The Temptations. The album was recorded at 5 studios in New York City: Chung King House Of Metal, Unique Recording Studios, Inc., Electric Lady Studios, Ian London Studios, Greene St. Recording.

In response to albums such as Eric B. &amp; Rakim&#x27;s &quot;Paid In Full&quot;, Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back&quot;, and Boogie Down Productions&#x27; &quot;Criminal Minded&quot; and &quot;By All Means Necessary&quot;, the group made a distinct departure from their earlier work, as Jam-Master Jay used a heavier amount of sampling.

Run and DMC also made changes in their rapping style (heavily influenced by Rakim) as techniques such as alliteration, polysyllabic rhyming, and internal rhyme are found in songs like &quot;I&#x27;m Not Going Out Like That,&quot; &quot;Radio Station&quot;, and the title track. The group also introduces storytelling to their arsenal in &quot;Ragtime&quot;. Despite this, Run-D.M.C. does not abandon their formula of combining hip-hop beats with hard rock guitar riffs, using it in &quot;Miss Elaine&quot;, the title track, &quot;Soul To Rock And Roll&quot;, and &quot;Mary, Mary&quot;.

==Film==
The album was accompanied by the release of a crime film of the same name by New Line Cinema with Rick Rubin as a director and starring Run-D.M.C. According to the plot Run-D.M.C. must find and punish the evil drug lord-record company executive who murdered their friend. Along the way, they encounter racist bikers, blonde bimbos, and the Beastie Boys. The film was released on September 16, 1988, and was panned by critics.

<text>Harry Binswanger (; born 1944) is an American professor and author. He is an Objectivist and a board member of the Ayn Rand Institute. He was an associate of Ayn Rand, working with her on &quot;The Ayn Rand Lexicon&quot; and helping her edit the second edition of Rand&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot;. He is the author of &quot;How We Know: Epistemology on an Objectivist Foundation&quot; (2014).

==Biography==
Harry Binswanger was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. His father, Sam Binswanger, was president of the family business, Binswanger Glass Company, founded in 1872.

In 1961, Binswanger entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, having since early childhood had a keen interest in science in general and later in theoretical physics in particular. 

But after becoming aware of and then studying Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy, Objectivism, he chose philosophy as his major and neuroscience as his minor. In 1965 he received a Bachelor of Science in Humanities and Engineering (XXI-B).

As an undergraduate, Binswanger argued for Objectivism in philosophy courses taught by some of the field&#x27;s leading figures, including Philippa Foot, Hubert Dreyfus, and Hilary Putnam. During his senior year, he helped start a campus Objectivist group, the M.I.T. Radicals for Capitalism, and he published a mimeographed periodical on Objectivism, initially named &quot;The Atlantis Review&quot;. 

In June, 1965, he came to New York City to pursue a doctorate in philosophy at Columbia University and to be in the city that was then the center of Objectivism, where Ayn Rand and her associates gave frequent lectures. Through the 1960s and 1970s, he got to know Ayn Rand, and in her final years, they became good friends, meeting once or twice a week to discuss ideas--and play &quot;Scrabble&quot;.

Binswanger&#x27;s own philosophical work is solidly in the tradition of Rand&#x27;s philosophy. From 1980 through 1987, he published and edited a bimonthly journal called &quot;The Objectivist Forum&quot;, which was later published as a hardback collection. He edited the new material in the second edition of Rand&#x27;s book, &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot;, published in 1990 after her death. He also conceived and created &quot;The Ayn Rand Lexicon&quot;, a compilation of Rand&#x27;s views on some 400 topics in philosophy and cognate fields. His book, &quot;How We Know: Epistemology on an Objectivist Foundation&quot;, was published in 2014.

Binswanger was on the board of directors of the Ayn Rand Institute for 36 years and is currently on the faculty of Ayn Rand University. He also moderates and posts to a fee-based online discussion group on Objectivism, called &quot;The Harry Binswanger Letter&quot;, which he has operated since 1998. Binswanger was previously a contributor to &quot;Forbes&quot; and RealClearMarkets. His television appearances have included &quot;Glenn Beck&quot; and &quot;Geraldo at Large&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life&quot;, the Academy Award-nominated documentary by Michael Paxton, and &quot;Ayn Rand &amp; the Prophecy of Atlas Shrugged&quot;, a 2011 documentary by Chris Mortensen.

==Views==
Binswanger has been described as an &quot;orthodox&quot; Objectivist who is committed to ideas of his mentor Rand, whom he considers a &quot;once in a millennium genius&quot;. Binswanger expressed support for Israel on &quot;Glenn Beck&quot; and denied global warming in his &quot;Forbes&quot; column of April 3, 2013. He calls for &quot;absolutely open immigration&quot; in a post on his website.

In 1986, Binswanger and John Ridpath participated in a debate on Socialism vs Capitalism against John Judis and Christopher Hitchens. In this debate he argued for the merits of capitalism as compared to socialism from an Objectivist perspective. During the debate, Binswanger stated &quot;Colonialism is the best thing that ever happened to the colonies,&quot; and &quot;We view the colonialization of India and the rest of the world [...] as the extending of wealth and civilization to backward regions.&quot;

<text>The Strong National Museum of Play (also known as just The Strong Museum or simply the Strong) is part of The Strong in Rochester, New York, United States. Established in 1969 and initially based on the personal collection of Rochester native Margaret Woodbury Strong, the museum opened to the public in 1982, after several years of planning, cataloguing, and exhibition development for the museum&#x27;s new building in downtown Rochester.

For at least fifteen years after it opened, the mission of the museum was to interpret the social and cultural history of average Americans between 1830 and 1940, under the direction of H.J. Swinney and William T. Alderson. Mrs. Strong&#x27;s collections of dolls and toys, American and European decorative arts, prints, paintings, Japanese crafts, and advertising ephemera provided a firm foundation for this mission, and were supplemented with collections purchased and donated to more fully support the museum&#x27;s early mission. The museum received considerable local and national publicity/support as well as substantial financial support from the National Endowment for the Humanities&#x27; Exhibitions and Public Programs division.

In the 1990s, the museum&#x27;s Board of Trustees and director changed the museum&#x27;s mission to collecting, preserving, and interpreting the history of play. Since then, it has refined and increased its collections (hundreds of thousands of items), and expanded thrice, in 1997, 2006, and 2023.

The museum is now one of six Play Partners of The Strong, which is also home to the National Toy Hall of Fame, the International Center for the History of Electronic Games, the World Video Game Hall of Fame, and the Brian Sutton-Smith Library and Archives of Play, and produces the &quot;American Journal of Play&quot;.

==About== 
Originally known as the &quot;Margaret Woodbury Strong Museum&quot; and later simply as the &quot;Strong Museum&quot;, it became the &quot;Strong National Museum of Play&quot; in 2006, after completing renovations and an expansion that nearly doubled its size to .

The National Museum of Play is the only collections-based museum anywhere devoted solely to the study of play, and although it is a history museum, it has the interactive characteristics of a children&#x27;s museum, making it the second largest museum of that type in the United States. The museum includes exhibits that interpret the key elements of play, as well as allow guests to explore the worlds of Sesame Street, The Berenstain Bears, Reading Adventureland, and the &quot;Dancing Wings Butterfly Garden&quot;.

=== Exhibits ===

The museum&#x27;s exhibits are immersively themed to video games, storybooks, television shows, education, nature, history, comic books, carousel and train rides, and children&#x27;s lifestyles. eGameRevolution is the first permanent video game exhibit in the US and includes the World Video Game Hall of Fame. The National Toy Hall of Fame is at the museum. Dancing Wings Butterfly Garden features thousands of butterflies, and is the largest indoor butterfly garden in New York. The Berenstain Bears: Down a Sunny Dirt Road is an original, permanent exhibit produced in partnership with the Berenstain family.

In 2019, The Strong Museum received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop an interactive exhibit space to show the influence of video games on culture, with plans to open in 2022. After delays, the expansions were unveiled in July 2023, which included the ESL Digital Worlds exhibit, a new space to house the World Video Game Hall of Fame, and the Hasbro Game Park, a large board game-themed outdoor space. The additions added of space at a final cost of .

==== War Toys: Ukraine ====
On 10 November 2023, the &quot;War Toys: Ukraine&quot; exhibit, highlighting Russian war crimes in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, was opened for the first time in The Strong Museum, as a part of a tour around museums in North America:

The exhibit remained open at The Strong till March 16, 2024.

<doc id="1165304" wikidata="Q321690" url="?curid=1165304" title="Philibert de Gramont">
<text>Philibert, Count de Gramont (1621–1707), was a French courtier and soldier, known as the protagonist of the &quot;Mémoires&quot; written by Anthony Hamilton (his brother-in-law). He was a younger half-brother of Antoine III of Gramont and uncle of Catherine Charlotte de Gramont, princess of Monaco.

== Birth and origins ==
Philibert was born in 1621, probably at the Château de Bidache, the second son of Antoine II de Gramont and his second wife, Claude de Montmorency-Bouteville. His father was the head of the Gramont family and ruler of the Principality of Bidache. At the time of Philibert&#x27;s birth his father was count of Guiche but later became duke of Gramont. His first wife had been Louise de Roquelaure.

Philibert&#x27;s mother was his father&#x27;s second wife. She was the eldest daughter of , baron of Bouteville, and sister of François de Montmorency-Bouteville. The Montmorency-Boutevilles were a cadet branch of the House of Montmorency.

Philibert&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Diane d&#x27;Andouins, comtesse de Guiche, was &quot;&quot;la belle Corisande&quot;,&quot; one of the mistresses of Henry IV. The grandson assumed that his father, Antoine II de Gramont, viceroy of Navarre, was a son of Henry IV, and regretted that his father had not claimed the privileges of royal paternity.








His parents had married in 1618. Philibert was one of six full siblings and also had two half brothers from his father&#x27;s first marriage. See the lists in his father&#x27;s article but also Antoine, duke of Gramont, his eldest half-brother, by himself.

== Early life ==
Philibert was destined for the church, and was educated at the college of Pau, in Béarn. He refused the ecclesiastical life, however, and joined the army of Prince Thomas of Savoy, then in 1643 besieging Trino in Piedmont. He afterwards served under his elder half-brother, Antoine, Marshal Gramont, and the prince de Condé. He was present at the battles of Freiburg and Nördlingen, and served with distinction in Spain and Flanders in 1647. In 1654 he fought at Arras where Turenne relieved the town besieged by the Spanish.

Philibert favoured Condé&#x27;s party at the beginning of the Fronde, but changed sides before he was too severely compromised. Despite his record in the army, he never received any important commission either military or diplomatic. He was, however, made governor of the Pays d&#x27;Aunis and lieutenant of Béarn. He visited England during the Commonwealth.

== Exile and marriage ==
In 1662 Philibert was exiled from France for courting Anne-Lucie de la Mothe-Houdancourt, one of the king&#x27;s mistresses. He went to England where he found at the court of Charles II an atmosphere congenial to his talents for intrigue, gallantry and pleasure. He arrived in London in January 1663. Philibert quickly entered into the English court&#x27;s inner circle. Not much adaptation was needed as French was the predominant language at the Restoration court. Philibert courted Anthony&#x27;s sister Elizabeth.

An anecdote tells how Philibert tried to leave her but was intercepted by her brothers George and Anthony at Dover. They asked him whether he had not forgotten something in London. He replied &quot;Pardonnez-moi, messieurs, j&#x27;ai oublié d&#x27;épouser votre sœur.&quot; (Forgive me, Sirs, I have forgotten to marry your sister). This episode might have occurred in autumn 1663 when Gramont&#x27;s sister Susanne-Charlotte in error told him that he could return to France. He went but found that he was not welcome. However, perhaps Philibert attempted to leave Elizabeth later, in December just before he consented to marry her. It has been said that this incident suggested to Molière his comedy &quot;Le mariage forcé&quot;, first presented 29 January 1664.

Philibert married Elizabeth in London in December 1663 or early in 1664. In March 1664, having heard of his marriage, Louis XIV allowed Philibert to come back. On 28 August the couple had a son who died as an infant.

== Back in France ==
In 1664 Philibert was allowed to return to France. He revisited England in 1670 in connection with the Sale of Dunkirk, and again in 1671 and 1676. In 1688 he was sent by Louis XIV to congratulate James II on the birth of an heir. From all these small diplomatic missions he succeeded in obtaining considerable profits, being destitute, and having no scruples whenever money was in question.

In June 1673, during the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), Philibert fought at the Siege of Maastricht in which Louis XIV took the town from the Dutch.

In 1679, Philibert succeeded his elder brother Henri, count of Toulongeon, who died unmarried. Thereafter, he called himself &quot;Comte de Gramont&quot; instead of &quot;Chevalier de Gramont&quot;. Henri also had bequeathed him his lands, and he inherited the château at Séméac.

On 31 December 1688 Count Gramont was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit in a ceremony performed in the Chapel of the Château de Versailles. This gave him the right to wear the blue sash called the &quot;cordon bleu&quot; that hangs over his right shoulder on his portrait.

At the age of 75, he fell dangerously ill, which caused him to become reconciled to the church. His penitence does not seem to have survived his recovery.
== Children ==
His wife gave him two children, daughters both:
# Claude Charlotte ( – 1739), who married Henry Stafford-Howard, 1st Earl of Stafford She died on 14 May 1739 and was buried at St James, Westminster.
# Marie Élisabeth (1667–1729), who in 1695 became abbess of the in Lorraine

Both were maids-of-honour to Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, whom the Grand Dauphin married in 1680. Saint-Simon comments that they did not have much success at the court.

He also had a bastard daughter, born in Piedmont, at the siege of Trino: &quot;Giacomo&quot; or &quot;Jacques&quot;, daughter of Countess Theresia de&#x27; Medici, granddaughter of don Antonio de&#x27; Medici via his son &quot;Antonfrancesco&quot;.

== Memoirs ==
Count Gramont was 80 years old when he supplied his brother-in-law, Anthony Hamilton, with the material for his &quot;Mémoires&quot;. Hamilton pretended that they had been dictated to him, but no doubt he was the real author. The account of Gramont&#x27;s early career was doubtless provided by himself, but Hamilton was probably more familiar with the history of the court of Charles II, which forms the most interesting part of the book. Moreover, Gramont, though he had a reputation for wit, was no writer, and there is no reason to suppose that he was capable of producing a work that remains a masterpiece of style and of witty portraiture.

His biographer Hamilton was far superior as a writer to Count Gramont, but he relates the story of his hero without comment, and no condemnation of the prevalent code of morals is allowed to appear, unless by an occasional touch of irony. The portrait is drawn with such skill that the count, despite his biographer&#x27;s candour, imposes by his grand air on the reader much as he appears to have done on his contemporaries. The book is the most entertaining of contemporary memoirs, and in no other book is there a description so vivid, truthful, and graceful of the licentious court of Charles II. There are other and less flattering accounts of the count. His scandalous tongue knew no restraint, and he was a privileged person who was allowed to state even the most unpleasing truths to Louis XIV.

When the &quot;Mémoires&quot; were completed, it is said that Gramont sold the manuscript for 1500 francs; and kept most of the money for himself. Fontenelle, then censor of the press, refused to license the book from considerations of respect to the strange old man, whose gambling, cheating and meanness were so ruthlessly exposed. But Gramont himself appealed to the chancellor and the prohibition was lifted.

== Death and timeline ==
Gramont died in the night from 29 to 30 January 1707 in Paris, and the &quot;Mémoires&quot; appeared six years later.

It was the first single by the band to go to number one on the Soul singles chart and the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It held that position on the Hot 100 for four weeks, from February 9 to March 8, 1969, and is remembered as one of the most popular songs of the 1960s. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 5 song of 1969.

==Overview==

The song is one of Sly Stone&#x27;s pleas for peace and equality between differing races and social groups, a major theme and focus for the band. The Family Stone featured white members Greg Errico and Jerry Martini in its lineup, as well as females Rose Stone and Cynthia Robinson; making it an early major integrated band in rock history. Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s message was about peace and equality through music, and this song reflects the same.

Unlike the band&#x27;s more typically funky and psychedelic records, &quot;Everyday People&quot; is a mid-tempo number with a more mainstream pop feel. Sly, singing the main verses for the song, explains that he is &quot;no better / and neither are you / we are the same / whatever we do.&quot;

Sly&#x27;s sister Rose Stone sings bridging sections using the cadence of the &quot;&quot; children&#x27;s taunt, also known as the children’s nursery rhyme Five Little Monkeys Swinging From a Tree. The chant mocks the futility of people hating each other for being tall, short, rich, poor, fat, skinny, white, black, or anything else. The bridges of the song contain the line &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot;, which became a popular catchphrase in 1969 (and inspired the name of the later television series, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;). Rose&#x27;s singing ends each part of the bridge with the words: &quot;And so on, and so on, and scooby dooby doo&quot;.

During the chorus, all of the singing members of the band (Sly, Rosie, Larry Graham, and Sly&#x27;s brother Freddie Stone) proclaim that &quot;I am everyday people,&quot; meaning that each of them (and each listener as well) should consider himself or herself as parts of one whole, not of smaller, specialized factions.

Bassist Larry Graham contends that the track featured the first instance of the &quot;slap bass technique&quot;, which would become a staple of funk and other genres. The technique involves striking a string with the thumb of the right hand (or left hand, for a left-handed player) so that the string collides with the frets, producing a metallic &quot;clunk&quot; at the beginning of the note. Later slap bass songs – for example, Graham&#x27;s performance on &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)&quot; – expanded on the technique, incorporating a complementary &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; component. 

The third verse of Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;, a No. 1 hit by February 1970, references the titles of &quot;Everyday People&quot; and several of the band&#x27;s other successful songs.

&quot;Everyday People&quot; was included on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Stand!&quot; (1969), which sold over three million copies. 

== Legacy ==
It is one of the most covered songs in the band&#x27;s repertoire, with versions by the Winstons, Aretha Franklin, the Staple Singers, William Bell, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, the Supremes and the Four Tops, Peggy Lee, Belle &amp; Sebastian, Pearl Jam, and many others. Hip-hop group Arrested Development used the song as the basis of their 1992 hit, &quot;People Everyday&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 8 on the Hot 100. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Everyday People&quot; as No. 145 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004 and No. 109 on their updated list in 2021. It was listed on Billboard&#x27;s 500 Best Pop Songs.

&quot;Everyday People&quot; was featured in a series of Toyota commercials in the late 1990s as part of their &quot;Everyday&quot; slogan campaign. In 2021, the song appeared in another TV commercial, this time for Aspen Dental.

==Cover versions==

Soul singer Billy Paul covered the song on his 1970 album &quot;Ebony Woman&quot;.

Joan Jett&#x27;s version appears on her 1983 release &quot;Album&quot;.

&quot;Everyday People&quot; by Ta Mara and the Seen was a minor hit in the Philippines in 1988.

Aretha Franklin performed a version of the song for her 1991 album &quot;What You See Is What You Sweat&quot;.

The 2005 Sly and the Family Stone tribute album &quot;Different Strokes by Different Folks&quot; features a cover by Maroon 5, accompanied by samples from the original recording.

<text>Active Desktop was a feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0&#x27;s optional Windows Desktop Update that allowed users to add HTML content to the desktop, along with some other features. This function was intended to be installed on the then-current Windows 95 operating system. It was also included in Windows 98 and later Windows operating systems up through 32-bit XP, but was absent from XP Professional x64 Edition (for AMD64) and all subsequent versions of Windows. Its status on XP 64-bit edition (for Itanium) and on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Server 2003 is not widely known. This corresponded to version Internet Explorer 4.0 to 6.x, but not Internet Explorer 7.

HTML could be added both in place of the regular wallpaper and as independent resizable desktop items. Items available online could be regularly updated and synchronized so users could stay updated without visiting the website in their browser.

Active Desktop worked much like desktop widget technology in that it allowed users to place customized information on their desktop.

==History==
The introduction of the Active Desktop marked Microsoft&#x27;s attempt to capitalize on the push technology trend led by PointCast. 

Active Desktop allowed embedding a number of &quot;channels&quot; on the user&#x27;s computer desktop that could provide continually-updated information such as web pages, without requiring the user to open dedicated programs such as a web browser. Example uses include overview over news headlines and stock quotes. However, its most notable feature was that it allowed Motion JPEGs and animated GIFs to animate correctly when set as the desktop wallpaper.

Active Desktop debuted as part of an Internet Explorer 4.0 preview release in July 1997, and came out with the launch of the 4.0 browser in September that year. for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, as a feature of the optional Windows Desktop Update offered to users during the upgrade installation. While the Windows Desktop Update is commonly referred to (improperly) as Active Desktop itself, it is actually an entire Windows shell upgrade from v4.0 to v4.71, or v4.72, with numerous changes to the Windows interface, resulting in an appearance and functionality level nearly indistinguishable from the then yet-to-be-released Windows 98. Features include the option to allow uppercase filenames (the old v4.0 desktop would forcibly display uppercase filenames in title case), configurable one-click hot-tracking file selection, customizable per-folder HTML display settings, QuickLaunch mini-buttons on the Taskbar next to the Start button, upgraded Start Menu allowing drag and drop item reordering and allowing right-click context menus for item renaming, etc. With the update, Windows Explorer featured an Address bar in which Internet addresses can be entered and seamlessly browsed.

Since Windows XP, if a non-BMP image is used as Windows Desktop wallpaper, Windows will convert non-BMP image to BMP image in background.

Active Desktop never attained any significant degree of popularity, as its drawbacks included high use of system resources and reduced system stability. The component was retained in Windows XP but was replaced by a feature named Windows Sidebar in Windows Vista. Sidebar in turn was called Windows Desktop Gadgets in Windows 7, which also allows components to be added to the desktop, but it was also discontinued due to security issues. Windows 8 (also 8.1 and 10) partially replaced their functionality with &quot;live tiles&quot; in the Start screen (or Start menu). Finally, such functionalities have now been partially replaced with Widgets in Windows 11. Windows Server 2003 R2 32-bit is the most recent Microsoft operating system to support Active Desktop. It appears that the 64-bit version of Windows XP no longer supports Active Desktop. However, it still provides the option to display Web pages and channels built with Microsoft&#x27;s Channel Definition Format (CDF) on the desktop.

The HTML displaying capabilities are now mainly used for creating original wallpapers and adding search boxes to the desktop. For example, a user could copy the following code to display Wikipedia&#x27;s search-box on the desktop:

&lt;form
 action=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search&quot;
 id=&quot;searchform&quot;
 name=&quot;searchform&quot;&gt;
 &lt;input
 accesskey=&quot;f&quot;
 id=&quot;searchInput&quot;
 name=&quot;search&quot;
 type=&quot;text&quot;
 value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input
 id=&quot;searchGoButton&quot;
 name=&quot;go&quot;
 type=&quot;submit&quot;
 value=&quot;Go&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<doc id="1165327" wikidata="Q933287" url="?curid=1165327" title="The Silent Force">
<text>The Silent Force is the third studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation, released on 15 November 2004, by GUN Records. On 5 August 2008, &quot;The Silent Force&quot; along with &quot;Mother Earth&quot; were released in the United States by Roadrunner Records. This album is the first to feature Ruud Jolie on lead guitar, as well as Martijn Spierenburg on keyboards, after Martijn Westerholt had to leave the band due to illness. It is also the first to feature Daniel Gibson as their producer. The album deepened the band symphonic approach, this time featuring more atmospheric songs that resemble the predominant fantasistic lyrics, inspired both by literature and the band members personal lives.

The album spawned three singles that helped increasing the band&#x27;s popularity in Europe, all of them achieving commercial success in their homeland and several other European countries. The first single, &quot;Stand My Ground&quot;, was released in November 2004 and reached the fourth position on the Dutch Top 40. The second single, &quot;Memories&quot;, was released on 31 January 2005. The third and final single, &quot;Angels&quot;, was released on 13 June 2005. In order to promote the album, the band commenced their The Silent Force Tour in July 2004, playing throughout Europe and also having one concert in Dubai.

The album was met with generally favorable reviews and commercial success, increasing the band&#x27;s popularity outside the Netherlands. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; considered the album important both for Within Temptation&#x27;s career and the development of the symphonic metal genre as a whole, a position shared by AllMusic. Only one week after its release, the album reached gold status in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Finland, later also achieving platinum status in Germany and double platinum in their homecountry.

==Production and recording==
The times preceding the composition and the release of &quot;The Silent Force&quot; were eventful for the band. After some line-up changes and the commercial and critical success of Mother Earth, released at the end of 2000, the band had been feeling pressured and vulnerable, as playing music was considered mainly a hobby for the members up to then. In addition to that, they had also switched labels, from Dutch independent DSFA Records to German GUN Records, which could promote them on a greater scale. This transition was met with contractual turmoil, as the band was still inexperient and their lawyers were not specialized in working inside the music industry.

Plans for the band&#x27;s third album came to fruition in 2004, and the band entered the studio in the summer that year. Writing took four to five months and recording took eight weeks. The band considered it a dark and tense time, as they were daily shutting themselves in an all-closed studio from 9am to 11pm and having their meals there. According to lead vocalist Sharon den Adel, the darkness of the studio itself contributed to enhance the gloomy feeling that dominated the band at the time.

Now signed to a bigger label, the budget for the recording sessions was improved. Due to that, the band were able to deepen the symphonic inclinations they already had and record with a full orchestra instead of using computerised orchestral sounds. It was, however, a challenging process, as the album was being recorded in the outskirts of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and the orchestra was situated in Moscow, Russia. The process of sending and receiving musical files was slow and laborious, due to the great size of the files and the low internet speed at that time. In spite of considering it stressful, den Adel commented that it all worked out really well in the end, and that the band grow a lot as musicians from that experience. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be produced by Daniel Gibson.

===Lyrics and inspiration===
Lyrically, the album took inspiration in fantasy, literature, and the band members personal lives. According to den Adel, the title of the album refers to the forces that sometimes lead people to do certain things. In an interview on Buzznet, she discussed the title of the album:

&quot;The title of our latest album &#x27;The Silent Force&#x27; is actually taken from the title of a book from the beginning of the 19th century from a Dutch writer (who lived in Indonesia when he was young) called Louis Couperus. All the songs on this album are in some way related to that book (or at least the title).&quot;
In an interview with Metal Hammer, den Adel commented that the depressing times the band members were undergoing during the writing and recording process reflected on the dark tone in the lyrics of the album. The political turmoil that the Netherlands were facing after the Assassination of Pim Fortuyn also impacted the band. Despite not agreeing with Fortuyn political views, the members were fearing for their future and also the future of their country. This topic was addressed on the song &quot;Stand My Ground&quot;. &quot;Angels&quot; is a song about betrayal. It deals with the fact that people one trusts often show themselves untrustworthy. Although the song is written through metaphors, as the band usually do, it was inspired by the record label disputes the band had with their previous label. The song starts with &quot;a fragile falsetto from Sharon&quot; and later builds &quot;into an emotional, symphonic anthem&quot;. The song &quot;Aquarius&quot; addresses den Adel&#x27;s relation of love and fear with the ocean, a fear she developed after watching Jaws as a child.

==Release and promotion==

In support of the release, the band embarked on a large international tour which spanned from 2004 to 2006, with dates across Europe, including their first festival appearance in the United Kingdom, headlining Bloodstock Open Air, and a one-off show in Dubai. &quot;Stand My Ground&quot; and &quot;Memories&quot;, the first singles from the new album, continued the band&#x27;s run of chart success in the Netherlands, culminating in a second Edison Award. The third single was &quot;Angels&quot;. &quot;Stand My Ground&quot; was later to be promoted on the trailer for the film &quot;Blood and Chocolate&quot;. The band also provided some of the sound track to the videogame &quot;Knights of the Temple: Infernal Crusade&quot;, released in March 2005. As of 2005, the album had already sold more than 400.000 copies only in Europe.

In January 2006, Within Temptation won the &quot;Dutch Pop Prize&quot; (best Dutch pop contribution) and &quot;Dutch Export Prize&quot; (best-selling Dutch artist outside the Netherlands); the latter one given to them for the third time in a row. The band also reported that they would start playing at festivals starting in April, in addition to going on an international tour at the end of the year. On 5 August 2008, &quot;The Silent Force&quot; was released in the US for the first time through Roadrunner Records.

The following music videos were released to promote the album and the tour:
#&quot;Stand My Ground&quot;
#&quot;Angels&quot;
#&quot;Memories&quot;
#&quot;Jillian (I&#x27;d Give My Heart)&quot; (promo video for the DVD &quot;The Silent Force Tour&quot;)

On 5 April 2019, &quot;The Silent Force&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time from Music On Vinyl. A limited edition of 5000 copies on clear vinyl were pressed. Inner Sleeve folded as poster with credits and lyrics.

==Reception==
The album earned generally positive reviews from critics. Critic Martin White from Blabbermouth.net gave the album a score of 9 out of 10 stars, stating that &quot;amazingly enough, the thick instrumentation and Sharon&#x27;s angelic delivery are never at odds with each other — a rare feat when it comes to music as complex and involved as Within Temptation&#x27;s is.&quot; Although, the listeners rating from Blabbermouth earned a score of merely 6.5 stars out of 10.

The webzine Lords of Metal was very positive and gave the album 94 out of 100, stating that the album is &quot;one of the most outstanding cd’s of the year&quot;. The website also compared the album with the two previous albums &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;Enter&quot; alleging that &quot;it lacks the variety of &quot;Enter&quot; or the finesse of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; – but it remains one of the best albums recorded on Dutch soil in the last ten years.&quot;

A review coming from Metal Storm webzine was less positive, saying that it&#x27;s just &quot;a good album&quot; and stating that the band &quot;lost their magic in their new songs&quot; in comparison with what the band did in their previous albums.

==Legacy==
As of the tenth anniversary of the album release, &quot;The Silent Force&quot; received a homage article by TeamRock&#x27;s Metal Hammer magazine regarding its influence both on Within Temptation&#x27;s career, the heavy metal genre and symphonic metal subgenre itself. In July 2016, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; also released a special issue edition claiming the 100 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century in which &quot;The Silent Force&quot; was awarded the 33rd place, over its influence and commercial success. On regarding the ten essential symphonic metal releases, the magazine also found a place for the album, characterizing it as an &quot;uplifting symphonic-based style that was rendered all the more saleable by the irresistible voice and presence of Sharon den Adel.&quot; In 2021, the magazine ranked it as the 5th best symphonic metal album of all time.

<text>Martín de Ursúa (or Urzúa) y Arizmendi (; February 22, 1653 – February 4, 1715), Count of Lizárraga and of Castillo, was a Spanish conquistador in Central America during the late colonial period of New Spain. Born in Olóriz, Navarre, he is noted for leading the 1696–97 expeditionary force which resulted in the fall of the last significant independent Maya stronghold, Nojpetén, located on an island in Lake Petén Itzá in the northern Petén Basin region of present-day Guatemala. He served as governor of the Yucatán until 1708, when he was named Governor-General of the Philippines. Around the time that he was named to that post, he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago. He died in Manila in 1715.

Ursúa arrived to Mexico around 1680 and initially served as a lawyer in Mexico City until 1692. He used this period to cement relationships with colonial officials in Yucatán. In 1692 he was appointed to be governor of Yucatán, with his term to begin in 1698. By 1694 he had been appointed as &quot;alcalde ordinario&quot; (a Spanish colonial official) of Mexico City. Ursúa took office in Yucatán four years earlier than planned, becoming acting governor on 17 December 1694.

==Family tree==
Martín de Ursúa was from a line of distinguished and successful noblemen that was extremely well connected politically and that intermarried with other influential noble families to form a kinship network that was spread across Europe and the Americas:

<text>The North Tyneside Steam Railway and Stephenson Steam Railway are visitor attractions in North Shields, North East England. The museum and railway workshops share a building on Middle Engine Lane adjacent to the Silverlink Retail Park. The railway is a standard gauge line, running south for from the museum to Percy Main. The railway is operated by the North Tyneside Steam Railway Association (NTSRA). The museum is managed by Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums on behalf of North Tyneside Council.

The railway runs along the alignment of various former coal wagonways, which were later used by the Tyne and Wear Metro Test Centre; the museum and workshop building used to be the test facility. The museum is dedicated to the railway pioneers George Stephenson and his son Robert, with one of George&#x27;s early locomotives, &quot;Billy&quot;, housed in the museum.

==History==

===Horse drawn and rope hauled waggonways===

As the early coal seams of the Northumberland Coalfield near the River Tyne were exhausted, waggonways were laid to serve pits sunk further north. Coal would be unloaded into colliers (coal transport ships) via staithes. The first wagonways used wooden waggons on wooden rails drawn by horses. The first traffic began in 1755 on a line from Shiremoor to Hayhole staithes, and was soon followed by more lines. Wooden rails were eventually replaced by wrought iron. Rope haulage was introduced from 1821, with the museum site being at the top of Prospect Hill. By the 1820s coal was coming from pits further to the north in Seghill, Backworth and Cramlington, while a pit at Murton near Shiremoor had also been added. In 1826 it also became the preferred route for coal coming from Fawdon to the west, to make it unnecessary to use keel boats further upriver.

Traffic increased as further pits opened, and the corridor from Middle Engine Lane down to Percy Main became congested as companies either shared lines or built their own within a hundred yards of each other, depending on which was more convenient. Once they crossed the line of the present A193 Wallsend Road, they fanned out to their respective unloading points. In 1839 the Cramlington wagonway built a new line away from the corridor further to the west, while still passing close to it at the Middle Engine Lane and Percy Main ends. By the 1840s, coal was also coming from Blyth and Bedlington on the east coast, although this ceased after improvements to Blyth harbour in the 1880s.

The opening of the route to Blyth also saw passenger services being run to Percy Main from 1841, for connections with the Newcastle and North Shields Railway. These were run by what eventually became the Blyth &amp; Tyne Railway. Passenger services ceased around 1864 when they opened an alternative route further to the east via Monkseaton (now the present Metro route).

===Steam locomotive working &amp; Metro test track===
At its peak, there were four lines on the corridor, with three stationary engines in close proximity to the museum. Having already been in use on other parts of the lines, gradient improvements on the Blyth &amp; Tyne&#x27;s line allowed it to use steam locomotives throughout from the 1850s. Others persisted with rope haulage, the Seaton Burn Wagonway being the last to convert in 1900.

Coal production began to decline after the First World War causing the Seaton Burn wagonway to close in the 1920s; a new route from the Rising Sun colliery to the west did open in 1939, although this was to replace a line on a different route. In the late 1940s the coal and railway companies were nationalised - the lines on the corridor were now controlled by either the National Coal Board (NCB) or British Rail (BR) (as the eventual owners of the Blyth &amp; Tyne). Rationalisation saw with the Cramlington line to the west closed in the 1950s.

As volumes further declined, the last Percy Main staithes closed in 1971, leading to the closure of the NCB lines, although the BR lines persisted. In 1975, the Seaton Burn wagonway alignment was relaid for use by the Tyne and Wear Metro Test Centre, with a test track running from Middle Engine Lane as far south as the A1058 Coast Road bridges, and north beyond Middle Engine Lane on the Backworth wagonway alignment to West Allotment. The two prototype Metrocars worked out of a two-road maintenance shed constructed in Middle Engine Lane. Once the Metro system opened in 1979, the test centre closed and the track infrastructure was dismantled, leaving only the shed. The last BR line (Percy Main to Backworth) closed in 1983 and the tracks were lifted, ending over 200 years of railway use of the corridor.

===Museum and heritage railway===

In 1982/4 North Tyneside Council acquired the test sheds as the nucleus for a transport museum. A partnership was formed between Tyne and Wear Museums and the council, to construct a steam hauled passenger railway rather than a static transport museum. The North Tyneside Steam Railway Association formed at the site after the Monkwearmouth Station Museum Association relocated to Middle Engine Lane, bringing with them some items of rolling stock they had been restoring in the Monkwearmouth station&#x27;s goods shed, which was in a deteriorating condition. From 1987, volunteers under supervision conducted the works necessary to relay a single track from the museum to Percy Main. The line was completed in 1989 and the first passenger trains ran in early 1991.

In 1994, Tyne and Wear Development Corporation and North Tyneside City Challenge made a grant available to North Tyneside Council to extend the workshops, redesign the museum space and construct a new facilities block. In 2003 the facilities block was further modified to improve educational and toilet facilities. In the early 1990s the LNER Class A4 4464 &quot;Bittern&quot; was displayed at the museum disguised as the &quot;Silver Link&quot;; the local Silverlink Business Park took its name from that locomotive due to it being at the museum of the time of construction. &quot;Bittern&quot; was moved to York in 1994 in exchange for loaning a Deltic.

In 2007, the Tyne and Wear Museums and North Tyneside Council&#x27;s head of cultural services have submitted plans for a feasibility study into developing the museum into a premier North East railway tourist attraction, with period buildings, a link to Percy Main Metro station, and all year round opening.

In 2019, Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums were given a lottery grant provided to redevelop the Stephenson Railway Museum. Among a lot of refurbishment in the museum building, this has also seen the name change from the Stephenson Railway Museum to the Stephenson Steam Railway.

In 2023 the Railway was awarded lottery funding to develop a woodland walk covering a two-acre site.

==Operation==

===Management===
The museum is managed by Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums on behalf of North Tyneside Council. Volunteers of the North Tyneside Steam Railway Association (NTSRA) operate the railway and assist with the maintenance and conservation of locomotives and rolling stock. The NTSRA is managed by a committee that meets quarterly and has an Annual General Meeting yearly.

===Infrastructure===
The building on Middle Engine Lane serves as the railway workshop and the museum&#x27;s indoor exhibition space, the workshop being on the left-hand side. The railway yard has three sidings entering the building from the south, the westernmost being for the workshop, while the two others enter the exhibition space allowing operational stock to be put on display.

The running line of the railway consists of a single track line, with two open-air platforms at either end, both with a passing loop. The northern platform, &quot;Middle Engine Lane&quot;, is just south of the museum building. The southern platform, &quot;Percy Main&quot;, is immediately south of the point where the Metro crosses the railway, paralleling the length of Brunton Street, to which there is pedestrian access for passengers wishing to leave the train there.

===Services===
Entry to the museum is free; rides on the trains requires purchase of a ticket. The museum building also contains a gift shop and toilet facilities, and a cafe which opens on certain event days. The cafe was renovated in Autumn 2017. The museum is only open at certain times of the year, and passenger trains are only run on some of those days.

As of 2018 two main timetables are in operation. Green timetable is used on Sundays/Bank Holidays which runs four round trips - departing at 11.30am, 12.30pm, 2.00pm and 3.00pm. The Blue timetable is used on Thursdays during school holidays which runs three round trips - departing at 12.30pm, 1.30pm and 2.30pm. Special event days include a Halloween Special, a 1940s weekend, Beer Festival (Ale by Rail), Winter Warmers and Santa Specials.

==Rolling stock==

===Stock list===
===Steam locomotives===

====&quot;Billy&quot;====
&quot;Billy&quot; was built by George Stephenson in 1816, and was one of the various pioneering designs now known as the Killingworth locomotives, because they were built for use in Killingworth Colliery. It is often referred to as the Killingworth Billy to differentiate it from Puffing Billy, built by William Hedley in 1813 for the Wylam Colliery. Killingworth Billy ran until 1879, and it was presented to the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1881. It is a stationary exhibit, mounted on a short stretch of period track with block-mounted rails, to remain compatible with horse-drawn trains. Horses would have been tripped up by conventional sleepers.

====No.1====
An 0-6-0 side tank built in 1951 as works number 7683. It is thought she was delivered new to Meaford Power Station to shunt coal waggons. It was one of several of its type supplied to power stations by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Ltd., Forth Banks, Newcastle upon Tyne during the 1950s. They were used to transport coal wagons from mainline sidings into the power station, supplying the boiler-house coal bunkers. Their small diameter wheels enabled heavy loads to be hauled at slow speeds. Larger wheeled versions were supplied when long journeys were needed - for example, some colliery systems. Locally they could be seen working at places in Northumberland and Durham including Ashington, Backworth, Stanley and Consett. This loco was purchased from the Power Station by the East Lancashire Railway and hauled their first trains at Bury. After a period in store, she was overhauled at Bury and moved to Tyneside in 1996. It ran for several years before being taken out of service in 2003. It is currently on display in the museum, awaiting overhaul.

====Ashington No.5 &quot;Jackie Milburn&quot;====
This 0-6-0 saddle tank was built in 1939 as works number 1970 by Peckett and Sons of Bristol for Ashington Coal Company which operated one of Britain&#x27;s most extensive colliery railway systems. In 1939, two identical locomotives were delivered to one of Peckett&#x27;s standard designs and they received the names Ashington No 5 &amp; Ashington No 6. The former spent her entire industrial career on the railway for which she was built. In 1969 she was sold by the National Coal Board to North Norfolk Preserved Railway when the Ashington system was dieselised. However, she returned to Northumberland in 1991 and was repainted into the &quot;as delivered to Ashington Colliery&quot; livery. The loco was additionally named &quot;Jackie Milburn&quot; in honour of the local football hero. The loco is currently out of service for repairs to the bottom end, expected to be complete and returned to service in 2024.

====A.No.5====

&quot;A.No.5&quot; is an 0-6-0 side tank built-in 1883 by Kitson and Company, as works number 2509. It was the last working example of the 1841 patented Stephenson &#x27;long boiler&#x27; design, to produce higher steam pressure while retaining a small wheelbase. Unsuited for high speeds, they nonetheless satisfied a need for powerful shunters at certain industrial railways like the Consett Iron and Steel Company. Withdrawn in 1972 it passed to Beamish Museum and then the Tyne &amp; Wear Museums Service at Monkwearmouth Station, Sunderland, where the Monkwearmouth Station Museum Association began its overhaul from a very derelict condition. It returned to steam in 1986. It was overhauled in 1995/6 and again in 2013/14. Removed from service and placed back on static display in the museum in summer 2018.

====No.401====

No. 401 was one of a class of three built for the Steel Company of Wales in 1950, as works number 2994 (2995 and 2996 were built in 1951), to an advanced specification designed to provide a low maintenance competitor to the diesel shunters emerging. As such it had many advanced features not seen on other industrial steam locomotives. It was sold to Austin Motor Co. Ltd., of Longbridge, Birmingham in 1957 before passing in 1973 to the developing West Somerset Railway. Once it became surplus to larger locomotives there, the Stephenson Railway Museum purchased 2994 and repainted it from &quot;Kermit the frog&quot; green to a black livery similar to a NER style. The locomotive was placed on static display in 2008. After a 6-year restoration period it returned to active service in Easter 2019. In 2020, 401 was repainted into its original &#x27;Steel Company of Wales Ltd&#x27; unlined maroon with lemon lettering livery.

====No.69====

No.69 was built in 1953, works number 3785. The engine spent its entire working life at South Hetton Colliery which served the Hawthorn and Murton colliery complex as well as Seaham. In preservation, it ran at the Yorkshire Dales Railway, now the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway, from 1977 until 1984 before being parked up pending overhaul. Restoration of the locomotive has begun with work completed including tyre turning, painting of the frames and overhaul of various boiler components as of January 2024. No.69 is privately owned by an NTSRA member/volunteer.

====No.4====
Built by Sentinel in 1953, this locomotive began its life at the Totternhoe Quarries in Dunstable, working for Rugby Portland Cement Co. Ltd as their No. 1. In 1964, it was reassigned to the company&#x27;s New Bilton Works in Rugby. A brief stint followed in early 1966 when it was loaned to the Southam Works in Warwickshire, though it returned to New Bilton within a couple of months.

By 1967, the locomotive changed hands, sold to Thomas Hill Ltd in Killamarsh, Yorkshire. The following year, it was resold to R.Y. Pickering &amp; Co. Ltd, a wagon manufacturer in Wishaw, Lanarkshire. Renumbered as No. 4, it took on the task of shunting a variety of wagons, including massive 100-ton bogie oil tankers. The company later became Norbrit-Pickering Ltd. In July 1979, the locomotive found a new home at the Tanfield Railway, arriving alongside RW Hawthorn Works No. 2009.

In 2024 - the locomotive was moved to its present location, the North Tyneside Steam Railway and is currently awaiting overhaul.

====BHC No. 2 (Pony)====
This locomotive, built by Hawthorn Leslie in 1912, originally served the Blyth Harbour Commission as BHC No. 2.

In 1971, it was sold to the Yorkshire Dales Railway at Embsay (now the Embsay &amp; Bolton Abbey Steam Railway) for restoration and renamed Pony. It was later moved to the Heritage Centre at County School, a preservation site initially managed by the Great Eastern Railway. The location eventually became a hub for the Mid-Norfolk Railway, and after a rebuild, the locomotive returned to service in 1994. Following the closure of the County School project in 1996, it was sold to a private buyer.

In 1998, the locomotive was purchased by the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust, relocated to Chatham, and renamed Achilles. It operated there until 2004, when its boiler certificate expired, taking it out of service. Later, in February 2022, it was moved to Derbyshire for an overhaul. As of 2024, the locomotive has changed ownership again and is now part of the North Tyneside Steam Railway collection.

===Diesel locomotives===
====No.08915====
No.08915 (originally D4145) used to be of Allerton (AN) depot. Restored to BR Blue in 2017.

====No.03078====
No.03078 (originally D2078) used to be of Gateshead (GD) depot. Repainted into BR Blue early 2019.

====No.10====
An early diesel built in 1958, Consett Iron and Steelworks No.10 is the last example of in-house production of locomotives by industrial railways in the North East. It was conceived in their Templetown workshops to satisfy a need for a 300 hp shunter with mechanical transmission, and was based on a Hunslet design. It was built by reusing many parts from steam locomotives. Eventually redundant to Sentinel&#x27;s with hydraulic transmission, it was donated in 1976 to the Tyne and wear Museums Service by the work&#x27;s later owner, the British Steel Corporation. Work has begun to return No.10 to operational condition which includes a full rewire and repairs to the compressed air system.

===Electric locomotives===

====Harton Electric E4====
Electric locomotive No.E4 was built for the Harton coal system at South Shields. It was stored outside for many years, but after a successful lottery bid and sponsorship from the local Siemens Microchip Company it was restored to working order by using battery power rather than an overhead supply. The batteries are carried in a converted coal wagon. It is currently not operational due to the traction battery becoming life expired. The locomotive is now on static display in the museum with the converted coal wagon joining the demonstration coal train rake.

====Motor Luggage Van 3267====
No. 3267 is the sole surviving example of the stock built-in 1904 for the Tyneside Electrics system, the first suburban electric railway in the country. The system used third rail power and trains formed into multiple units. The vehicle was one of two on the system fitted out as vans, with driving cabs at each end. They were used to carry fish and sundry goods, as well as acting as the locomotives for passenger services on the Riverside branch. After withdrawal in 1938, the two vans had their motors removed and were converted to de-icing vans, hauled along the system at night by steam locomotives. It has since been restored to NER livery, and is on static display in the museum, on loan from the National Rail Museum.

===Coaches, wagons and departmental stock===

The three ex-British Rail Mk1 carriages are used for the passenger trains. They were used on the Kings Cross suburban lines. They wear BR Midland Maroon Livery. They were preserved by the Bluebell Railway between 1973 and 1975, and were obtained by the museum in 1986.

The rail crane (No.DRS 81140, prev. DB 966401, 81/001, 24247) was designed for British Rail. It has been paired with an ex-LNER wagon converted to a crane runner (No.DE321051, ex-6282, 70130E) It is currently stored outdoors until such a time as it can be overhauled.

Nearly every wagon in the yard sees regular use, either on demonstration freight trains or permanent way/engineering trains. The 20-ton Dogfish Ballast Wagon, Salmon Rail Carrier and 20 Ton wooden brake van were all used in the construction of the railway in the late 1980/early 1990s.

The four-plank wagon was built in 1927 as an oil tank wagon for a private owner, presumably an industrial railway. It had the registration number LMSR 103136. It was later reduced to its underframe and sold to the Metro for use on the test track. Having been left on the site, the museum inherited it. They converted it into a four-plank open wagon for use as the carrier for the batteries needed to power the railway&#x27;s electric locomotive E4. It has been given a fictitious brown livery and markings of &quot;No.103 Boldon Colliery&quot; on one side and &quot;No.136 Whitburn Colliery&quot; on the other.

The 12-ton Vanfit goods van has been converted into a Tool Van which houses an electrical generator.

The TTP flat wagon was built as a Tank Wagon for a private owner. In 2019 it was repainted to resemble a match wagon to be paired with 03078.

The other four-wheel flat wagon is a former overhead wire drum carrier used in the electrification of the East Coast Mainline, it sat at Heaton TMD for many years and was donated to the railway in late 2019. The wagon is currently undergoing restoration as a conflat wagon.

Each of the three 21 ton coal hopper wagons are privately owned. No.722 and No.6555 arrived in early 2020 from the Ribble Steam Railway, No.B415776 arrived in 2018 from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.

Lambton Van 21 arrived in August 2020 from the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway and is privately owned. The wagon has been moved in to the carriage and wagon shop for re planking.

The former BR Petroleum tank wagon arrived in early 2019 from the Middleton Railway. The other two tank wagons are privately owned and arrived in early 2020 from the Ribble Steam Railway.

The 5 ton Type BD van and 12 ton Shocvan are stored in the open, as bodies only, i.e. demounted from their chassis.

==Transport==
The museum site includes a free car park. Bus stops on Middle Engine Lane itself provide direct connections west to Haymarket bus station in Newcastle or east to Blyth bus station via Whitley Bay. Other bus stops on Atmel Way in the adjacent Cobalt Business Park provide other connections, including to the two nearest Metro stations - Percy Main five minutes away to the south and Northumberland Park ten minutes away to the north (on the southern and northern sections of the North Tyneside loop, respectively).

Nearly all of the railway is paralleled by the National Cycle Route 10, which continues north from Middle Engine Lane along the alignment of the former railway to Backworth. Near the southern end, at the crossing with the A193 Wallsend Road the cycle route diverges from the railway to head south east, past Percy Main Metro, on its way to meet the east–west running National Cycle Route 72 which shadows the River Tyne.

On days when passenger services are in operation, the museum can also be accessed by joining the trains at the southern terminus, Percy Main Metro being around a 300m walk away from the platform through the residential estate of the same name.

<text>Redcliffe is a coastal town and suburb in the City of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. It also refers colloquially to the Redcliffe Peninsula as a whole, a peninsula jutting into Moreton Bay which contains several other suburbs. Since the 1880s, Redcliffe has been a popular seaside resort in South East Queensland. In the , the suburb of Redcliffe had a population of 10,460 people.

== Geography ==
Redcliffe is situated in the east north-east of the Redcliffe Peninsula on the western shore of the Moreton Bay. It is approximately north-north-east of the Brisbane CBD. It serves as the Central Business District for the Redcliffe Peninsula and its surrounding suburbs.

== History ==

Before European settlement, the Redcliffe Peninsula was occupied by the Ningy Ningy people. The Aboriginal name is &quot;Kau-in-Kau-in&quot;, which means Blood-Blood (red-like blood).

A famous Ningy Ningy Bora ring structure, consisting of two separate rings, large and small, joined by a ritual pathway, once existed between Kippa-Ring and Anzac Avenue. Aboriginals as far away as Noosa would travel there to perform initiation ceremonies. It was razed by the Council around 1950.

The town&#x27;s name originates from &quot;Red Cliff Point&quot; named by the explorer Matthew Flinders, referring to the red cliffs at Woody Point. Redcliffe became Queensland&#x27;s first colony in 1824; however, it was soon abandoned for Brisbane.

Redcliffe holds the distinction of being the first European settlement in Queensland, first visited by Matthew Flinders on 17 July 1799. Explorer John Oxley recommended &quot;Red Cliff Point&quot; – named after the red-coloured cliffs visible from Moreton Bay – to the Governor Thomas Brisbane for the new Moreton Bay penal colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.

The penal colony was established at Redcliffe on 13 September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers, some with wives and children, and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after one year and the colony was moved south to a site on the Brisbane River at North Quay, south, that offered a more reliable water supply. This settlement lead to the establishment of Brisbane, now Queensland&#x27;s capital city.

Redcliffe became a pastoral district in the 1860s and in the 1880s boomed as a seaside resort town. In 1878, a suburban subdivision called Portwood Estate (around the present day Portwood Street, Sheehan Street, and Sylvin Street) was offered for sale, with the lots described as &quot;large, elevated, picturesque, salubrious, with rare perspective&quot; in Humpy Bong which was to be &quot;the fashionable watering place of the future!&quot;. The estate map shows the Redcliffe railway line terminating at a railway station just to the north-east of the estate (in the area of present-day Macnaughton Street). However, the Redcliffe Peninsula railway line was not opened until October 2016 (138 years later) and the terminus was located in neighbouring Kippa-Ring.
In October 1881, approximately 60 allotments of &quot;Ramsgate Estate&quot; were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Arthur Martin &amp; Co, being subdivisions 1 to 60, of portion 205 in the Parish of Redcliffe.

Redcliffe State School opened circa 1888. It closed in 1909 when a new Humpybong State School was opened on a central site to amalgamate Redcliffe State School and the old Humpybong State School.

From 1911, the twin screw excursion steamer &quot;Koopa&quot; made regular trips to Redcliffe jetty. The principal route for passengers was a steamer from Sandgate pier to Woody Point Pier. The Hornibrook Bridge connecting Clontarf in the Town of Redcliffe to Brighton in City of Brisbane was completed in 1935 and allowed easy access to and from Brisbane by motor car leading the way to rapid suburban development. That led to the cessation of the Sandgate to Woody Point steamers.

Our Lady Help of Christians School opened in January 1922. It closed on 24 May 1995.

In 1937 a Presbyterian church was built on Prince Edward Parade at Queen&#x27;s Beach near Eversleigh Road. It was officially opened on Saturday 18 December 1937 by the Reverend James Gibson, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Queensland; the ceremony was attended by William Forgan Smith, the Queensland Premier, and Alfred H. Langdon, Mayor of Redcliffe. The two lots of land for the church had been purchased on 29 April 1920, adjacent to the Queensland Presbyterian Women&#x27;s Missionary Union house, &quot;The Haven&quot;.

Redcliffe State High School No 2045 opened on 3 February 1958.
In 1958, the Gibb family from Manchester, England emigrated to this area and called it home for a period. Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb went on to form the highly successful music group, The Bee Gees. In 1959, Brisbane based Speedcar driver Bill Goode, the promoter of the Redcliffe Speedway (located at the Redcliffe Showgrounds) hired the brothers to entertain the crowds at the speedway from the back of a truck during the interval. This was the first ever public performance by the trio. In a letter to the Redcliffe Museum in 1999, Barry Gibb wrote &quot;&quot;The smell of the oil, the noise and the atmosphere was incredible. This was the first public appearance Robin, Maurice and I ever made in Australia. We sang through the PA system and people threw money onto the track, and we met Brisbane&#x27;s leading DJ and racing car driver Bill Gates, who suggested we call ourselves the BG&#x27;s and even played our songs on his radio show, &quot;Swinging&#x27; Gates&#x27; Platter Chatter&quot;. Hence Redcliffe became the birthplace of the Bee Gees.&quot;&quot;

Redcliffe Opportunity School opened on 2 March 1964. In 1989, it was renamed Redcliffe State Special School.

The first high-rise apartment building was constructed along Marine Parade in 1974. For decades the interest for similar development was limited – until 2000 there were only four apartment buildings higher than 6 stories across the entire Peninsula. Renewed interest in Redcliffe as a seaside lifestyle precinct occurred in the 2000s and 2010s and as a result high rise and mix use development is found in all areas of Redcliffe along the coastline.

In 1975, the toll on the Hornibrook Highway was removed.

The current Redcliffe Library opened in 2000.

<text>The National Toy Hall of Fame is a U.S. hall of fame that recognizes the contributions of toys and games that have sustained their popularity for many years. Criteria for induction include: icon status (the toy is widely recognized, respected, and remembered); longevity (more than a passing fad); discovery (fosters learning, creativity, or discovery); and innovation (profoundly changed play or toy design). Established in 1998 under the direction of Ed Sobey, it was originally housed at A. C. Gilbert&#x27;s Discovery Village in Salem, Oregon, United States, but was moved to the Strong National Museum of Play (now The Strong) in Rochester, New York, in 2002 after it outgrew its original home.

As of 2024, eighty-eight (88) toys have been enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame:

<text>The name Sigar can refer to four people in Scandinavian mythology, surrounding the legends of Sigurd the dragon slayer. One of them only appears as the friend of Helgi Hjörvarðsson in the eddic lay &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;. The other two appear as the villainous members of the same clan in several sources.

==Icelandic sources==
Snorri Sturluson writes in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; that two Sigars belong to the same clan, the Siklings, and that they are the relatives of Siggeir, the villainous Geatish king in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;.

In &quot;Hversu Noregr byggðist&quot;, it is given in more detail that Sigar the elder had two sons, Sigmund and Siggeir who killed Völsung. Sigmund had the son Sigar the younger, who killed Hagbard.

It is told in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; that Sigar the younger was in a feud with Hagbard and Haki and his sons. He had kidnapped one of Haki&#x27;s daughters and murdered a second:

Sigar the younger is also mentioned in &quot;Háleygjatal&quot; (as quoted in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;), where a gallows is referred to as &quot;Sigar&#x27;s steed&quot; (&quot;Sigars jó&quot;):

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
In &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 7), Saxo tells that Sigar had a daughter named Signy. Sigar was in a feud with Haki&#x27;s brother Hagbard, but was informed by Signy&#x27;s handmaid, that Hagbard had a secret love affair with Signy. Sigar decided to hang Hagbard, who, however, managed to inform Signy of this. Signy set her house on fire and succumbed in the flames while Hagbard executed himself in the gallows. Sigar tried in vain to save both Hagbard and Signy but failed. His only consolation was to bury the treacherous maid alive.

&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; disagrees with the other sources by presenting Sigar as the son of Sywaldus, who was the son of Yngwin, a Geatish king who became the king of Denmark.

<doc id="1165345" wikidata="Q936687" url="?curid=1165345" title="Intelligent design movement">
<text>The intelligent design movement is a neo-creationist religious campaign for broad social, academic and political change to promote and support the pseudoscientific idea of intelligent design (ID), which asserts that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.&quot; Its chief activities are a campaign to promote public awareness of this concept, the lobbying of policymakers to include its teaching in high school science classes, and legal action, either to defend such teaching or to remove barriers otherwise preventing it. The movement arose out of the creation science movement in the United States, and is driven by a small group of proponents. The Encyclopædia Britannica explains that ID cannot be empirically tested and that it fails to solve the problem of evil; thus, it is neither sound science nor sound theology.

== Purpose ==
The overall goal of the intelligent design movement is to overthrow materialism and atheism. Its proponents believe that society has suffered &quot;devastating&quot; cultural consequences from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of the decay into materialism because it seeks only natural explanations, and is therefore atheistic. They believe that the scientific theory of evolution implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning. They seek to &quot;reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview&quot;, represented by the theory of evolution, in favor of &quot;a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.&quot;

To achieve their goal of defeating a materialistic world view, advocates of intelligent design take a two-pronged approach. Alongside the promotion of intelligent design, proponents also seek to &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot;; discredit evolution by emphasizing perceived flaws in the theory of evolution, or disagreements within the scientific community and encourage teachers and students to explore non-scientific alternatives to evolution, or to critically analyze evolution and the controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution. But the world&#x27;s largest general scientific society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has stated that &quot;There is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of evolution.&quot; and that &quot;Evolution is one of the most robust and widely accepted principles of modern science.&quot; The ruling in the 2005 Dover, Pennsylvania, trial, &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a United States federal court, stated that &quot;evolution, including common descent and natural selection, is &#x27;overwhelmingly accepted&#x27; by the scientific community.&quot;

The Discovery Institute (DI) is a religious think tank that drives the intelligent design movement. The Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture (CSC) counts most of the leading intelligent design advocates among its membership, most notably its former program advisor the now deceased Phillip E. Johnson. Johnson was the architect of the movement&#x27;s key strategies, the wedge strategy and the &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign. The Discovery Institute and leading proponents represent intelligent design as a revolutionary scientific theory. The overwhelming majority of the scientific community, as represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences and nearly all scientific professional organizations, firmly reject these claims, and insist that intelligent design is not valid science, its proponents having failed to conduct an actual scientific research program. This has led the movement&#x27;s critics to state that intelligent design is merely a public relations campaign and a political campaign.

According to critics of the intelligent design movement, the movement&#x27;s purpose is political rather than scientific or educational. They claim the movement&#x27;s &quot;activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it.&quot; Intelligent design is an attempt to recast religious dogma in an effort to reintroduce the teaching of biblical creationism to public school science classrooms; the intelligent design movement is an effort to reshape American society into a theocracy, primarily through education. As evidence, critics cite the Discovery Institute&#x27;s political activities, its wedge strategy and statements made by leading intelligent design proponents. The scientific community&#x27;s position, as represented by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), is that intelligent design is not science, but creationist pseudoscience. Richard Dawkins, a biologist and professor at Oxford University, compares the intelligent design movement&#x27;s demand to &quot;teach the controversy&quot; with the demand to teach flat Earthism; acceptable in terms of history, but not in terms of science. &quot;If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science--one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat--you are misleading children.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
At the 1999 &quot;Reclaiming America for Christ Conference&quot; called by Reverend D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, Phillip E. Johnson gave a speech called &quot;How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won.&quot; In it he sums up the theological and epistemological underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for victory:

&quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot;, mentioned in the quote above, received harsh criticism from the scientific community, including negative reviews by evolutionary scientist Nathan Lents.

== History of the movement ==
The intelligent design movement grew out of a creationist tradition which argues against evolutionary theory from a religious standpoint, usually that of evangelical or fundamentalistic Christianity. Although intelligent design advocates often claim that they are arguing only for the existence of a designer who may or may not be God, all the movement&#x27;s leading advocates believe that this designer is God. They frequently accompany their arguments with a discussion of religious issues, especially when addressing religious audiences, but elsewhere downplay the religious aspects of their agenda.

=== Origins ===
The modern use of the words &quot;intelligent design,&quot; as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry, began after the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; (1987), ruled that creationism is unconstitutional in public school science curricula. A Discovery Institute report says that Charles Thaxton, editor of &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, had picked the phrase up from a NASA scientist, and thought &quot;That&#x27;s just what I need, it&#x27;s a good engineering term.&quot; In drafts of the book over one hundred uses of the root word &quot;creation,&quot; such as &quot;creationism&quot; and &quot;creation science,&quot; were changed, almost without exception, to &quot;intelligent design,&quot; while &quot;creationists&quot; was changed to &quot;design proponents&quot; or, in one instance, &quot;cdesign proponentsists.&quot; In 1989, &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; was published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), with the definition:

&quot;Pandas&quot; was followed in 1991 by &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot;, a neo-creationist polemic by Phillip E. Johnson, that is regarded as a central text of the movement. &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; mentioned &quot;Pandas&quot; as &quot;&#x27;creationist&#x27; only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of &#x27;intelligent design&#x27; with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution,&quot; but his use of the term as a focus for his wedge strategy promoting &quot;theistic realism&quot; came later. The book was reviewed by evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould for &quot;Scientific American&quot; in July 1992, concluding that the book contains &quot;... no weighing of evidence, no careful reading of literature on all sides, no full citation of sources (the book does not even contain a bibliography) and occasional use of scientific literature only to score rhetorical points.&quot; Gould&#x27;s review led to the formation in 1992 or 1993 of an &#x27;Ad Hoc Origins Committee&#x27; of Johnson&#x27;s supporters, which wrote a letter, circulated to thousands of university professors, defending the book. Among the 39 signatories were nine who later became members of the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC).

During the early 1990s Johnson worked to develop a &#x27;big tent&#x27; movement to unify a wide range of creationist viewpoints in opposition to evolution. In 1992, the first formal meeting devoted to intelligent design was held in Southern Methodist University. It included a debate between Johnson and Michael Ruse (a key witness in &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; (1982)) and papers by William A. Dembski, Michael Behe and Stephen C. Meyer. In 1993, Johnson organized a follow-up meeting, including Dembski, Behe, Meyer, Dean H. Kenyon (co-author of &quot;Pandas&quot;) and Walter Bradley (co-author with Thaxton and Kenyon of &quot;The Mystery of Life&#x27;s Origin&quot; (1984)), as well as two graduate students, Paul A. Nelson and Jonathan Wells.

=== Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture ===

On December 6, 1993, an article by Meyer was published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, drawing national attention to the controversy over Dean H. Kenyon&#x27;s teaching of creationism. This article also gained the attention of Discovery Institute co-founder Bruce Chapman. On discovering that Meyer was developing the idea of starting a scientific research center in conversations with conservative political scientist John G. West, Chapman invited them to create a unit within the Discovery Institute called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (later renamed the Center for Science and Culture). This center was dedicated to overthrowing &quot;scientific materialism&quot; and &quot;fomenting nothing less than a scientific and cultural revolution.&quot;
A 1995 conference, &quot;The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture,&quot; served as a blueprint for the center. By 1996 they had nearly a million dollars in grants, the largest being from Howard Ahmanson, Jr., with smaller but still large contributions coming from the Stewardship Foundation established by C. Davis Weyerhaeuser and the Maclellan Foundation, and appointed their first class of research fellows.

=== The wedge strategy ===

The wedge strategy was formulated by Phillip E. Johnson to combat the &quot;evil&quot; of methodological naturalism. It first came to the general public&#x27;s attention when a Discovery Institute internal memo now known as the &quot;Wedge Document&quot; (believed to have been written in 1998) was leaked to the public in 1999. However it is believed to have been an update of an earlier document to be implemented between 1996 and 2001.

The document begins with &quot;The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built.&quot; and then goes on to outline the movement&#x27;s goal to exploit perceived discrepancies within evolutionary theory in order to discredit evolution and scientific materialism in general. Much of the strategy is directed toward the broader public, as opposed to the professional scientific community. The stated &quot;governing goals&quot; of the CSC&#x27;s wedge strategy are:
:1. To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies
:2. To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God

Critics of intelligent design movement argue that the Wedge Document and strategy demonstrate that the intelligent design movement is motivated purely by religion and political ideology and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy obfuscates its agenda. The Discovery Institute&#x27;s official response was to characterize the criticism and concern as &quot;irrelevant,&quot; &quot;paranoid,&quot; and &quot;near-panic&quot; while portraying the Wedge Document as a &quot;fund-raising document.&quot;

Johnson in his 1997 book &quot;Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds&quot; confirmed some of the concerns voiced by the movement&#x27;s gainsayers:
=== Kansas evolution hearings ===

The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, from May 5 to May 12, 2005, by the Kansas State Board of Education and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the origin of life would be taught in the state&#x27;s public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the conservative Board with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; method.

The hearings raised the issues of creation and evolution in public education and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is purportedly the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities.

The Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.

Local science advocacy group Kansas Citizens for Science organized a boycott of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings. Board member Kathy Martin declared at the beginning of the hearings &quot;Evolution has been proven false. ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts.&quot; At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is &quot;an unproven, often disproven&quot; theory.

&quot;ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic,&quot; asserted Martin. The scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying &quot;Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science.&quot;

On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.

=== &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; (2005) ===

In the movement&#x27;s sole major case, &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, it was represented by the Thomas More Law Center, which had been seeking a test-case on the issue for at least five years. However conflicting agendas resulted in the withdrawal of a number of Discovery Institute Fellows as expert witnesses, at the request of DI director Bruce Chapman, and mutual recriminations with the DI after the case was lost. The Alliance Defense Fund briefly represented the Foundation for Thought and Ethics in its unsuccessful motion to intervene in this case, and prepared &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs on behalf of the DI and FTE in it. It has also made &quot;amicus curiae&quot; submissions and offered to pay for litigation, in other (actual and potential) creationism-related cases. On a far smaller scale, Larry Caldwell and his wife operate under the name Quality Science Education for All, and have made a number of lawsuits in furtherance of the movement&#x27;s anti-evolution agenda. In 2005 they brought at least three separate lawsuits to further the intelligent design movement&#x27;s agenda. One was later abandoned, two were dismissed.

== Reception by the public ==
An August 2005 poll from The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life showed 64% of Americans favoring the teaching of creationism along with evolution in science classrooms, though only 38% favored teaching it instead of evolution, with the results varying deeply by education level and religiosity. The poll showed the educated were far less attached to intelligent design than the less educated. Evangelicals and fundamentalists showed high rates of affiliation with intelligent design while other religious persons and the secular were much lower.

== Reception by the scientific community ==
Jason Rosenhouse summarized the prevailing attitude of the scientific community: &quot;Scientists who have responded to ID arguments in print have generally done so with a tone of sneering contempt. This is understandable: ID supporters present fallacious arguments, use dishonest rhetoric, and often present non-contemptuous responses as evidence that their theories are gaining acceptance.&quot;

Intelligent design advocates realize that their arguments have little chance of acceptance within the mainstream scientific community, so they direct them toward politicians, philosophers and the general public. What prima facie &quot;scientific&quot; material they have produced has been attacked by critics as containing factual misrepresentation and misleading, rhetorical and equivocal terminology. A number of documentaries that promote their assertion that intelligent design as an increasingly well-supported line of scientific inquiry have been made for the Discovery Institute. The bulk of the material produced by the intelligent design movement, however, is not intended to be scientific but rather to promote its social and political aims. Polls indicate that intelligent design&#x27;s main appeal to citizens comes from its link to religious concepts.

Scientists responding to a poll overwhelmingly said intelligent design is about religion, not science. A 2002 sampling of 460 Ohio science professors had 91% say it&#x27;s primarily religion, 93% say there is not &quot;any scientifically valid evidence or an alternate scientific theory that challenges the fundamental principles of the theory of evolution,&quot; and 97% say that they did not use intelligent design concepts in their own research.

In October and November 2001, the Discovery Institute advertised &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot; in three national publications (&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;), listing what they claimed were &quot;100 scientific dissenters&quot; who had signed a statement that &quot;We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.&quot; Shortly afterwards the National Center for Science Education described the wording as misleading, noting that a minority of the signatories were biologists and some of the others were engineers, mathematicians and philosophers, and that some signatories did not fully support the Discovery Institute&#x27;s claims. The list was further criticized in a February 2006 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; which pointed out that only 25% of the signatories by then were biologists and that signatories&#x27; &quot;doubts about evolution grew out of their religious beliefs.&quot; In 2003, as a humorous parody of such listings the NCSE produced the pro-evolution Project Steve list of signatories, all with variations of the name Steve and most of whom are trained biologists. As of July 31, 2006, the Discovery Institute lists &quot;over 600 scientists,&quot; while Project Steve reported 749 signatories; as of May 30, 2014, 1,338 Steves have signed the statement, while 906 have signed &quot;A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism&quot; as of April 2014.

== Structure ==

=== The &#x27;big tent&#x27; strategy ===
The movement&#x27;s strategy as set forth by Phillip E. Johnson states the replacement of &quot;materialist science&quot; with &quot;theistic science&quot; as its primary goal; and, more generally, for intelligent design to become &quot;the dominant perspective in science&quot; and to &quot;permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life.&quot; This agenda is now being actively pursued by the Center for Science and Culture, which plays the leading role in the promotion of intelligent design. Its fellows include most of the leading intelligent design advocates: William A. Dembski, Michael Behe, Jonathan Wells and Stephen C. Meyer.

Intelligent design has been described by its proponents as a &#x27;big tent&#x27; belief, one in which all theists united by having some kind of creationist belief (but of differing opinions as regards details) can support. If successfully promoted, it would reinstate creationism in the teaching of science, after which debates regarding details could resume. In his 2002 article in &quot;Christian Research Journal&quot;, Discovery Institute fellow Paul A. Nelson credits Johnson for the &#x27;big tent&#x27; approach and for reviving creationist debate since the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; decision. According to Nelson, &quot;The promise of the big tent of ID is to provide a setting where Christians (and others) may disagree amicably, and fruitfully, about how best to understand the natural world, as well as Scripture.&quot;

In his presentation to the 1999 &quot;Reclaiming America for Christ Conference,&quot; &quot;How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won,&quot; Johnson affirmed this &#x27;big tent&#x27; role for &quot;The Wedge&quot; (without using the term intelligent design):

The Discovery Institute consistently denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda has religious foundations, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when &quot;World News Tonight&quot; asked about the Discovery Institute&#x27;s many evangelical Christian donors the Institute&#x27;s public relations representative stopped the interview saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think we want to go down that path.&quot;

=== Obfuscation of religious motivation ===
Phillip E. Johnson, largely regarded as the leader of the movement, positions himself as a &quot;theistic realist&quot; against &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; and intelligent design as the method through which God created life. Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design recognized &quot;as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message.&quot; Hence intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately introducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes &quot;the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion&quot; and that &quot;after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact&quot; only then can &quot;biblical issues&quot; be discussed. In the foreword to &quot;Creation, Evolution, &amp; Modern Science&quot; (2000) Johnson writes &quot;The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that &#x27;In the beginning was the Word,&#x27; and &#x27;In the beginning God created.&#x27; Establishing that point isn&#x27;t enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message.&quot;

=== Organizations ===

==== The Center for Science and Culture ====

The Center for Science and Culture, formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, is a division of the Discovery Institute. The Center consists of a tightly knit core of people who have worked together for almost a decade to advance intelligent design as both a concept and a movement as necessary adjuncts of its wedge strategy policy. This cadre includes Phillip E. Johnson, Michael Behe, William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer. They are united by a religious vision which, although it varies among the members in its particulars and is seldom acknowledged outside of the Christian press, is predicated on the shared conviction that America is in need of &quot;renewal&quot; which can be accomplished only by unseating &quot;Godless&quot; materialism and instituting religion as its cultural foundation.

In his keynote address at the &quot;Research and Progress in intelligent design&quot; (RAPID) conference held in 2002 at Biola University, William A. Dembski described intelligent design&#x27;s &quot;dual role as a constructive scientific project and as a means for cultural renaissance.&quot; In a similar vein, the movement&#x27;s hub, the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture had until 2002 been the &quot;&quot;Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture&quot;.&quot; Explaining the name change, a spokesperson for the CSC insisted that the old name was simply too long. However, the change followed accusations that the center&#x27;s real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians.

Critics of the movement cite the Wedge Document as confirmation of this criticism and assert that the movement&#x27;s leaders, particularly Phillip E. Johnson, view the subject as a culture war: &quot;Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story. ... When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind of conflict that is known as a &#x27;culture war.&#x27;&quot;

Recently the Center for Science and Culture has moderated its previous overtly theistic mission statements to appeal to a broader, more secular audience. It hopes to accomplish this by using less overtly theistic messages and language. Despite this, the Center for Science and Culture still states as a goal a redefinition of science, and the philosophy on which it is based, particularly the exclusion of what it calls the &quot;unscientific principle of materialism,&quot; and in particular the acceptance of what it calls &quot;the scientific theory of intelligent design.&quot;

Promotional materials from the Discovery Institute acknowledge that the Ahmanson family donated $1.5 million to the Center for Science and Culture, then known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, for a research and publicity program to &quot;unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism&#x27;s cultural legacy.&quot; Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the Christian religious right, including Christian Reconstructionism, whose goal is to place the US &quot;under the control of biblical law.&quot; Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian Reconstructionist Chalcedon Foundation.

==== Other organizations ====
*The Access Research Network (ARN) has become a comprehensive clearinghouse for ID resources, including news releases, publications, multimedia products and an elementary school science curriculum. Its stated mission is &quot;providing accessible information on science, technology and society issues from an intelligent design perspective.&quot; Its directors are Dennis Wagner and CSC Fellows Mark Hartwig, Stephen C. Meyer and Paul A. Nelson. Its &#x27;Friends of ARN&#x27; is also dominated by CSC Fellows.
*The Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE) is a Christian non-profit organization based in Richardson, Texas, that publishes textbooks and articles promoting intelligent design, abstinence, and Christian nationism. CSC Fellows Charles Thaxton and William A. Dembski have served as academic editors for the Foundation. The FTE has close associations with the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement and other religious Christian groups.
*The Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center (IDEA Center) is a Christian nonprofit organization formed originally as a student club promoting intelligent design at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). There are about 25 active chapters of the organization in the United States, Kenya, Canada, Ukraine, and the Philippines. There have been 35 active chapters formed and several others are currently pending. Six out of the listed 32 chapters in the United States are located at high schools. In December 2008, biologist Allen MacNeill stated, on the basis of analysis of the webpages of the national organization and local chapters, that it appeared that the organization is moribund.
*The Intelligent Design Network (IDnet) is a nonprofit organization formed in Kansas to promote intelligent design. It is based in Shawnee Mission, Kansas. The Intelligent Design Network was founded by John Calvert, a corporate finance lawyer with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology and nutritionist William S. Harris. Together, Calvert and Harris have published the article in &quot;The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly&quot;. Calvert also has written a play about intelligent design in a high school biology class with Daniel Schwabauer.

== Activism ==
The intelligent design movement primarily campaigns on two fronts: a public relations campaign meant to influence the popular media and sway public opinion; and an aggressive lobbying campaign to cultivate support for the teaching of intelligent design amongst policymakers and the wider educational community. Both these activities are largely funded and directed by the Discovery Institute, from national to grassroots levels. The movement&#x27;s first goal is to establish an acceptance of intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science; its long-term goal is no less than the &quot;renewal&quot; of American culture through the shaping of public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. As the Discovery Institute states, intelligent design is central to this agenda: &quot;Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.&quot;

The Discovery Institute has also relied on several polls to indicate the acceptance of intelligent design. A 2005 Harris poll identified ten percent of adults in the United States as taking what they called the intelligent design position, that &quot;human beings are so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them.&quot; (64% agreed with the creationist view that &quot;human beings were created directly by God&quot; and 22% believed that &quot;human beings evolved from earlier species.&quot; 49% accepted plant and animal evolution, while 45% did not.) Although some polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls have been criticized as suffering from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions.

Critics of intelligent design and its movement contend that intelligent design is a specific form of creationism, neo-creationism, a viewpoint rejected by intelligent design advocates. It was bolstered by the 2005 ruling in United States federal court that a public school district requirement for science classes to teach that intelligent design is an alternative to evolution was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, United States District Judge John E. Jones III that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.

In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts. Responding to the well-organized curricular challenges of intelligent design proponents to local school boards have been disruptive and divisive in the communities where they&#x27;ve taken place. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly and divert scarce funds away from education into court battles. Although these court battles have almost invariably resulted in the defeat of intelligent design proponents, they are draining and divisive to local schools. For example, as a result of &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of &quot;teaching the controversy&quot; - presenting intelligent design as an allegedly scientific alternative to evolution.
Leading members of the intelligent design movement are also associated with denialism, both Phillip E. Johnson and Jonathan Wells have signed an AIDS denialism petition.

=== Campaigns ===

The Discovery Institute, through its Center for Science and Culture, has formulated a number of campaigns to promote intelligent design, while discrediting evolutionary biology, which the Institute terms &quot;Darwinism.&quot;

Prominent Institute campaigns have been to &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; and, more recently, to allow Critical Analysis of Evolution. Other prominent campaigns have claimed that intelligent design advocates (most notably Richard Sternberg) have been discriminated against, and thus that Academic Freedom bills are needed to protect academics&#x27; and teachers&#x27; ability to criticise evolution, and that there is a link from evolution to ideologies such as Nazism and eugenics. These three claims are all publicised in the pro-ID movie &quot;&quot; (2008). Other campaigns have included petitions, most notably &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot;.

The response of the scientific community has been to reiterate that the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of scientific consensus whereas intelligent design has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community (see list of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design).

=== Politics and public education ===

The main battlefield for this culture war has been US regional and state school boards. Courts have also become involved as those campaigns to include intelligent design or weaken the teaching of evolution in public school science curricula are challenged on First Amendment grounds. In &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, the plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Intelligent design is an integral part of a political campaign by cultural conservatives, largely from evangelical religious convictions, that seek to redefine science to suit their own ideological agenda. Though numerically a minority of Americans. the politics of intelligent design is based less on numbers than on intensive mobilization of ideologically committed followers and savvy public relations campaigns. Political repercussions from the culturally conservative sponsorship of the issue has been divisive and costly to the effected communities, polarizing and dividing not only those directly charged with educating young people but entire local communities.

With a doctrine that calls itself science among non-scientists but is rejected by the vast majority of the real practitioners, an amicable coexistence and collaboration between intelligent design advocates and upholders of mainstream science education standards is rare. With mainstream scientific and educational organizations saying the theory of evolution is not &quot;in crisis&quot; or a subject doubted by scientists, nor intelligent design the emergent scientific paradigm or rival theory its proponents proclaim, &quot;teaching the controversy&quot; is suitable for classes on politics, history, culture, or theology they say, but not science. By attempting to force the issue into science classrooms, intelligent design proponents create a charged environment that forces participants and bystanders alike to declare their positions, which has resulted in intelligent design groups threatening and isolating high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.

In a round table discussion entitled &quot;Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design?&quot; at the American Enterprise Institute on 21 October 2005 and televised on C-SPAN, the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Mark Ryland and the Thomas More Law Center&#x27;s Richard Thompson had a frank disagreement, in which Ryland claimed the Discovery Institute has always cautioned against the teaching of intelligent design, and Thompson responded that the Institute&#x27;s leadership had not only advocated the teaching of intelligent design, but encouraged others to do so, and that the Dover Area School District had merely followed the Institute&#x27;s calls for action. As evidence, Thompson cited the Discovery Institute&#x27;s guidebook &quot;Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula&quot; written by the Institute&#x27;s co-founder and first director, Stephen C. Meyer, and David K. DeWolf, a CSC Fellow, which stated in its closing paragraphs: &quot;Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution -- and this includes the use of textbooks such as &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.&quot;

=== Higher education ===
In 1999, William A. Dembski was invited by Baylor University president Robert B. Sloan to form the Michael Polanyi Center, described by Dembski as &quot;the first Intelligent Design think tank at a research university.&quot; Its creation was controversial with Baylor faculty, and in 2000 it was merged with the Institute for Faith and Learning. Dembski, although remaining as a research professor until 2005, was given no courses to teach.

Two universities have offered courses in intelligent design: Oklahoma Baptist University, where ID advocate Michael Newton Keas taught &#x27;Unified Studies: Introduction to Biology,&#x27; and Biola University, host of the Mere Creation conference. Additionally, numerous Christian evangelical institutions have faculty with interests in intelligent design. These include Oral Roberts University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Patrick Henry College teaches creationism but also exposes its students to both Darwinian evolution and intelligent design.

In 2005, the American Association of University Professors issued a strongly worded statement asserting that the theory of evolution is nearly universally accepted in the community of scholars, and deploring requirements &quot;to make students aware of an &#x27;intelligent-design hypothesis&#x27; to account for the origins of life.&quot; It said that such requirements are &quot;inimical to principles of academic freedom.&quot;

=== The Web ===

Much of the actual debate over intelligent design between intelligent design proponents and members of the scientific community has taken place on the Web, primarily blogs and message boards, instead of the scientific journals and symposia where traditionally much science is discussed and settled. In promoting intelligent design the actions of its proponents have been more like a political pressure group than like researchers entering an academic debate as described by movement critic Taner Edis. The movement lacks any verifiable scientific research program and concomitant debates in academic circles.

The Web continues to play a central role in the Discovery Institute&#x27;s strategy of promotion of intelligent design and it adjunct campaigns. On September 6, 2006, on the Center&#x27;s &quot;Evolution News &amp; Views&quot; blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled &quot;Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries.&quot; In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that Wikipedia&#x27;s coverage of ID to be &quot;one sided&quot; and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published a Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers &quot;to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design.&quot;

=== International ===
Despite being primarily based in the United States, there have been efforts to introduce pro-intelligent design teaching material into educational facilities in other countries. In the United Kingdom, the group Truth in Science has used material from the Discovery Institute to create free teaching packs which have been mass-mailed to all UK schools. Shortly after this emerged, government ministers announced that they regarded intelligent design to be creationism and unsuitable for teaching in the classroom. They also announced that the teaching of the material in science classes was to be prohibited.

== Criticisms of the movement ==
One of the most common criticisms of the movement and its leadership is that of intellectual dishonesty, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence. It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Critics of the movement, such as Eugenie Scott, Robert T. Pennock and Barbara Forrest, claim that leaders of the intelligent design movement, and the Discovery Institute in particular, knowingly misquote scientists and other experts, deceptively omit contextual text through ellipsis, and make unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials. Theologian and molecular biophysicist Alister McGrath has a number of criticisms of the Intelligent design movement, stating that &quot;those who adopt this approach make Christianity deeply... vulnerable to scientific progress&quot; and defining it as just another &quot;god-of-the-gaps&quot; theory. He went on to criticize the movement on theological grounds as well, stating &quot;It is not an approach I accept, either on scientific or theological grounds.&quot;

Such statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory&#x27;s PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, respectively, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: &quot;Probe Ministries&quot; for Bohlin, &quot;Reasons to Believe&quot; ministry for Rana, and the Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;Center for Science and Culture&quot; for Wells. Similarly confusing lists of local scientists were circulated during controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas. In another instance, the Discovery Institute frequently mentions the Nobel Prize in connection with Henry F. Schaefer, III, a CSC Fellow, and chemist at the University of Georgia. Critics allege that Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a &quot;five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize&quot; because Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years.

This criticism is not reserved only to the Institute; individual intelligent design proponents have been accused of using their own credentials and those of others in a misleading or confusing fashion. For example, critics allege William A. Dembski gratuitously invokes his laurels by boasting of his correspondence with a Nobel laureate, bragging that one of his books was published in a series whose editors include a Nobel laureate, and exulting that the publisher of the intelligent design book &quot;The Mystery of Life&#x27;s Origin&quot;, Philosophical Library, also published books by eight Nobel laureates. Critics claim that Dembski purposefully omits relevant facts which he fails to mention to his audience that in 1986, during the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; hearings, 72 Nobel laureates endorsed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief that noted that the &quot;evolutionary history of organisms has been as extensively tested and as thoroughly corroborated as any biological concept.&quot;

Another common criticism is that since no intelligent design research has been published in mainstream, peer-reviewed scientific journals, the Discovery Institute often misuses the work of mainstream scientists by putting out lists of articles that allegedly support their arguments for intelligent design drawing from mainstream scientific literature. Often, the original authors respond that their articles cited by the center don&#x27;t support their arguments at all. Many times, the original authors have publicly refuted them for distorting the meaning of something they&#x27;ve written for their own purposes.

Sahotra Sarkar, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas, has testified that intelligent design advocates, and specifically the Discovery Institute, have misused his work by misrepresenting its conclusions to bolster their own claims, has gone on to allege that the extent of the misrepresentations rises to the level of professional malfeasance:

An October 2005 conference called &quot;When Christians and Cultures Clash&quot; was held in Christ Hall at Evangelical School of Theology in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Attorney Randall L. Wenger, who is affiliated with the Alliance Defense Fund, and a close ally of the Discovery Institute, and one of the presenters at the conference advocated the use of subterfuge for advancing the movement&#x27;s religious goals: &quot;But even with God&#x27;s blessing, it&#x27;s helpful to consult a lawyer before joining the battle... For instance, the Dover area school board might have had a better case for the intelligent design disclaimer they inserted into high school biology classes had they not mentioned a religious motivation at their meetings... Give us a call before you do something controversial like that... I think we need to do a better job at being clever as serpents.&quot;

Critics state about the wedge strategy that its &quot;ultimate goal is to create a theocratic state&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In 2017, theoretical physicist Mano Singham wrote that since the ruling of &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, &quot;little&quot; has been &quot;heard from&quot; the intelligent design movement, adding &quot;Whereas before one heard of ID all over the place, now one has to seek them out by visiting the Discovery Institute which has become kind of a refuge for the last holdouts.&quot;

<text>Roller skates are boots with wheels mounted to the bottom, allowing the user to travel on hard surfaces similarly to an ice skater on ice. The first roller skate was an inline skate design, effectively an ice skate with a line of wheels replacing the blade. In modern usage, the term typically refers to skates with two pairs of wheels on shared axles like those of skateboards (early versions of which were made using roller skate parts). Skates with this configuration are also known as &quot;quad skates&quot; or &quot;quads&quot; and, like skateboards, steer by tilting the skate to one side, which causes the axles to turn inward.

== History ==

While the first reported use of wheeled skates was on a London stage in 1743, the first patented &quot;roller skate&quot; was introduced in 1760 by Belgian inventor John Joseph Merlin. They were hard to steer and stopping was difficult due to the fact that they did not have any type of braking mechanism and as such they failed to gain popularity. Merlin demonstrated his invention during a party in the city of Huy, during which he skated while playing the violin.

In the 1840s, Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Le prophète&quot; featured a scene in which performers used roller-skates to simulate ice-skating on a frozen lake set on stage. This exposure had an impact on audiences and led to the rise of roller skating as a new and popular activity throughout the Continent. As ice skaters subsequently developed the art of figure skating, roller skaters wanted the ability to turn in their skates in a similar fashion.

In 1863, James Plimpton from Massachusetts invented the &quot;rocking&quot; skate and used a four-wheel configuration for stability, and independent axles that turned by pressing to one side of the skate or the other when the skater wants to create an edge. This was a vast improvement on the Merlin design, one that was easier to use and drove the huge popularity of roller skating, dubbed &quot;rinkomania&quot; in the 1860s and 1870s, which spread to Europe and around the world, and continued through the 1930s. The Plimpton skate is still used today.

Eventually, roller skating evolved from just a pastime to a competitive sport; speed skating, racing on skates, and inline figure skating, very similar to what can be seen in the Olympics on ice. In the mid 1990s roller hockey, played with a ball rather than a puck, became so popular that it even made an appearance in the Olympics in 1992. The National Sporting Goods Association statistics showed, from a 1999 study, that 2.5 million people played roller hockey. Roller skating was considered for the 2012 Summer Olympics but has never become an Olympic event. Other roller skating sports include jam skating and roller derby.

Roller skating popularity began during the late 1950s and 1960s at rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll teen dance halls, but exploded and took off in the 1970s and 1980s due to the introduction of large rubberized polymer wheels such as Krypto-Pro, to replace metal wheels, becoming popular and an iconic thing of that time. In the early 1990s it would begin to diminish in popularity. Sales of roller skates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought safe outdoor activities.

Roller skating saw a revival in the late 2010s and early 2020s, spurred on by a number of viral videos on the popular video-sharing app TikTok and also a revival of 1970s and 1980s pop culture from film and TV nostalgia. Many popular brands sold out to the point of back-order, with many people taking up the hobby during COVID-19 quarantines across the globe.

== Parts ==

A roller skate has two main parts: the boot and the plate, which is the part that holds the wheels and provides the ability to steer. There are two main categories of roller skate boots: a high-top boot with a raised heel similar to an ice figure skating boot, and a flat-soled boot cut at or below the ankle. The plate is bolted to the boot, typically by drilling holes through the sole of the boot to match existing holes in the plates and placing bolts with low-profile heads inside the boots with nuts on the outside facing the floor. For boots with a raised heel, screws can be driven into the heel directly. Roller skate plates are composed of several parts: the base structural component is also called the plate, and the trucks, which are the main steering components, are attached to it in a way that allows the trucks to steer when the plate is tilted. Almost all roller skate plates achieve this by sandwiching each truck between a pair of flexible cylindrical &quot;cushions&quot; or bushings so that it can tilt. The stack is held together by a &quot;kingpin&quot; that passes through the center of the stack and is used to adjust the compression applied to the cushions. The &quot;traditional&quot; kingpin is a bolt that threads into the plate and is secured by a jam nut against the plate. Most modern plates use a &quot;flipped&quot; kingpin instead, which is a threaded stud attached to the plate and allows preload adjustments using a locking nut. To prevent the truck from rotating around the kingpin, an additional protrusion from the truck called a &quot;pivot pin&quot; sits in a cup on the plate.

== Organizations ==

The Roller Skating Rink Operators Association was developed in the U.S. in 1937. It is currently named the Roller Skating Association. The association promotes roller skating and offers classes to the public, aiming to educate the population about roller skating. Its current president is Bobby Pender and the associations headquarters are located in Indianapolis.

==Health benefits==
The Roller Skating Association&#x27;s web page offers some health benefits of roller skating. Some of the benefits they list include:
* Providing a complete aerobic workout 
* Burning per hour while skating for a person or while skating . 
* A study from the University of Massachusetts found that in-line skating causes less than 50% of the impact shock to joints compared to running. 
* Roller skating is equivalent to jogging in terms of health benefits

<text>Berryhill Fields is an area of grassland in the heart of Stoke-on-Trent in England, between the housing estates of Bentilee and Berryhill and the town of Fenton. It is a local nature reserve, owned and managed by Stoke-on-Trent City Council. Its area is .

==History==
The earthwork remains of a medieval manor house (Lawn Farm moated site, a scheduled monument) are within the area. It is thought to have once been the manor house of Fenton Vivian (that later became the town of Fenton), named after Vivian of Standon, lord of the manor in the 13th century.

In the first half of the 20th century there were two coal mines on the present Berryhill Fields, and small scale farming. The land was acquired for housing in the 1950s but no building took place. A subsequent plan for open-cast mining was turned down in 1994.

===Regeneration===
The site was the subject of a £2 million regeneration project for the Millennium, managed by Groundwork Stoke, as part of the nationwide Changing Places programme, that included creating new pathways to facilitate access for people with disabilities, creating a number of art features, and funding a series of archaeological excavations on the site of the 13th-century moated manor house sited on the fields.

<text>Octavius Brooks Frothingham (November 26, 1822 – November 27, 1895) was an American clergyman and author.

==Biography==
He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Nathaniel Langdon Frothingham (1793–1870), a prominent Unitarian preacher, and through his mother&#x27;s family he was related to Phillips Brooks. He graduated from Harvard College in 1843 and from the Divinity School in 1846. On March 23, 1847, he married Caroline Martha Curtis (February 5, 1825 - June 8, 1900).

===Pastorates===
He was pastor of the North Unitarian church of Salem, Massachusetts, from 1847 to 1855. He broke with this congregation over the issue of slavery. From 1855 to 1860, he was pastor of a new Unitarian society in Jersey City. There he gave up the Lord&#x27;s Supper, thinking that it ministered to self-satisfaction.

It was as a radical Unitarian that he became pastor of another young church in New York City in 1860. The name of the church was initially the Third Unitarian Congregational Church. From the beginning, Frothingham belonged to the most radical wing of the Unitarians. Indeed, in 1864 he was recognized as leader of the radicals after his reply to Frederic Henry Hedge&#x27;s address to the graduating students of the Divinity School on &quot;Anti-Supernaturalism in the Pulpit.&quot;

In 1865, when he had practically given up transcendentalism, his church building was sold and his congregation began to worship in Lyric Hall under the name of the Independent Liberal Church, their connection with the Unitarian denomination being thereby sundered. In 1875, they moved to the Masonic Temple, but four years later ill-health compelled Frothingham&#x27;s resignation, and the church dissolved. Paralysis threatened him, and he never fully recovered his health.Frederic Henry Hedge In 1881, he returned to Boston, and devoted himself to literary work until his death there.

===Later life===
To the later period of his life belongs his best literary work. While he was in New York, he was for a time art critic of the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Always himself on the unpopular side and an able but thoroughly fair critic of the majority, he habitually underestimated his own worth; he was not only an anti-slavery leader when abolition was not popular even in New England, and a radical and rationalist when it was impossible for him to stay conveniently in the Unitarian Church, but he was the first president of the Free Religious Association (1867) and an early and ardent disciple of Darwin and Spencer.

Frothingham wrote the first biography of philanthropist and abolitionist Gerrit Smith. While he said Smith had advance notice of Brown&#x27;s planned raid, Smith&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth Smith Miller, ordered the books recalled and pages removed. A second edition was prepared under her supervision with the offending material altered.

Though always faithful to his radical views, in later years, his judgement grew more generous and catholic. He was a greater orator than a writer, and his sermons in New York were delivered to large audiences, averaging one thousand at the Masonic Temple, and were printed each week; in eloquence and in the charm of his spoken word he was probably surpassed in his day by none save George William Curtis. Personally he seemed cold and distant, partly because of his impressive appearance, and partly because of his own modesty, which made him backward in seeking friendships.

He died at his home in Boston on November 27, 1895. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.

<text>The Mersey River, formerly known as Rivière Rossignol by the Acadians, is a river in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is named after the River Mersey in Liverpool, England. The river proper flows from the eastern end of Eleven Mile Lake in Annapolis County southward to Kejimkujik Lake in Kejimkujik National Park, then through Lake Rossignol to empty into the Atlantic Ocean at the town of Liverpool, Nova Scotia. The true source of the river however is as far northwest as Sandy Bottom Lake (Annapolis County) or Tuskopeake Brook (Annapolis County) on the northern tributary.

The river was a major transportation route for the Mi&#x27;kmaq people of Nova Scotia. Later, it was used to transport logs out of the interior of the province. The river was described in Albert Bigelow Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Tent Dwellers&quot;, albeit under the name &#x27;Liverpool river&#x27;. There are a number of hydroelectric projects on the river, which has been exploited for more than a hundred years.

Much of the headwater area is composed of fen. It is a popular river for novice canoeists. Smallmouth bass has been found in the Mersey and neighbouring watersheds.

<doc id="1165374" wikidata="Q2039590" url="?curid=1165374" title="Signy">
<text>Signy or Signe (, sometimes known as ) is the name of two heroines in two connected legends from Norse mythology which were very popular in medieval Scandinavia. Both appear in the Völsunga saga, which was adapted into other works such as Wagner&#x27;s &#x27;Ring&#x27; cycle, including its famous opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. Signy is also the name of two characters in several other sagas.

The first Signy is the daughter of King Völsung. She was married to the villainous Geatish king Siggeir who has her whole family treacherously murdered, except for her brother Sigmund. She saves her brother, has an incestuous affair with him and bears the son Sinfjötli. She burnt herself to death with her hated husband.

The second Signy is the daughter of King Siggeir&#x27;s nephew Sigar. She fell in love with the Sea-King Hagbard, and promised him that she would not live if he died. They were discovered and Hagbard was sentenced to be hanged. Hagbard managed to signal this to Signy who set her house on fire and died in the flames whereupon Hagbard hanged himself in the gallows. See Hagbard and Signy.

A third Signy is the daughter of a witch named Grid in &quot;Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra&quot;. They are both delivered from a curse by a young man named Illugi.

A fourth Signy was Hroðgar&#x27;s sister in &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;. She is unnamed in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==In &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;==

Signy was the only daughter of King Völsung of Hunaland and Hljod the giantess. She and her twin brother Sigmund were the oldest of Volsung&#x27;s eleven children. Signy reluctantly married King Siggeir of Gautland after he asked King Volsung for her hand. It was at their wedding feast that Sigmund drew the sword Gram from Barnstokkr.

Three months after her wedding, Signy&#x27;s father and brothers visited her at her new home in Gautland. Signy warned them of her husband&#x27;s plan to betray them. Despite her warning, Volsung is killed and all of Signy&#x27;s brothers are captured. At Signy&#x27;s request, her brothers are put in the stocks rather than executed, but each night one was killed by a she-wolf. When only Sigmund was left alive, Signy sent a man to smear honey on his face and mouth, which the wolf only licked, allowing Sigmund to escape alive. Signy then helped her brother to hide in the woods.

Signy wanted nothing but to see her father&#x27;s death avenged. She sent her elder son to Sigmund for him to help in this endeavor. When Sigmund revealed to her that he was unworthy, Signy told Sigmund to kill him, which he did. The same happened with her younger son.

Signy met a sorceress with whom she exchanged shapes. Signy, looking like the sorceress, went to her brother in the woods and slept with him for three nights. She then returned to the castle and regained her appearance. After a time she gave birth to a son Sinfjötli. He was also sent to her brother in the forest when he was nine years old. Sigmund and Sinfjötli kill Siggeir to avenge the death of their father/grandfather together. It is only after this that Signy informs Sigmund of the incest that led to Sinfjötli&#x27;s birth. Signy then walks into the fire that is killing her husband, announcing, &quot;In everything I have worked toward the killing of King Siggeir. I have worked so hard to bring about vengeance that I am by no means fit to live. Willingly I will now die with King Siggeir, although I married him reluctantly.&quot;

<doc id="1165379" wikidata="Q7330198" url="?curid=1165379" title="Richard de Mille">
<text>Richard de Mille (February 12, 1922 – April 8, 2009) was an American author.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Monrovia, California, to William C. deMille and the author and screenwriter Lorna Moon, when William C. was still married to his first wife, Anna George de Mille. His uncle, Cecil B. DeMille, adopted and raised Richard, not telling him of his true parentage until the death of William DeMille when Richard was 33 years old.

He first enrolled at Columbia University with the class of 1944, later transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles before graduating.

== Writing career ==
He served with the United States Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946. That year, he became a writer and director at KTLA, remaining in that position through 1950. Around this time he joined the movement that was to become Scientology leaving KTLA to become an editorial/personal assistant to founder L. Ron Hubbard. De Mille used the nom de plume &quot;D. Folgere&quot; (the Old English pronunciation of &quot;follower&quot;) when editing and/or ghost-writing during that time, despite Hubbard&#x27;s protests that it would appear &quot;Dick de Mille wasn&#x27;t a true believer&quot;. He was attracted to Hubbard because, as he later said, &quot;I thought he was a great man who had made a great discovery, and whatever his shortcomings they must be discounted because he had the answer.&quot; On February 24, 1951, De Mille assisted Hubbard in kidnapping the latter&#x27;s wife, Sara, from her apartment in Los Angeles in an unsuccessful bid to have her declared insane by a psychiatrist. They eventually released her in Yuma, Arizona. The two men had already taken Hubbard&#x27;s daughter Alexis and a few days later flew together with Alexis to Havana, Cuba. In 1953, he was an associate professor at Sequoia University and taught at the Department of Scientology. It was during this time that he wrote &quot;Introduction to Scientology&quot; published by the Scientology Council, at the time an affiliate of Sequoia University. By 1954, however, he had become disillusioned with Scientology and left the organization, explaining that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like all the contradictions and I was becoming more and more sceptical of the whole thing&quot;.

In 1955, he completed his B.A. degree at Pepperdine University and married Margaret Belgrano. He went on to get a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 1961. He remained with that institution as a research psychologist until 1962, when he became a lecturer in psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1965, he left that position, and became editorial director of the Brooks Foundation the following year. He stayed there until 1967, becoming a research psychologist at the General Research Corp. in 1968, where he remained through to 1973.

He also wrote a biography of his birth mother, screenwriter Lorna Moon entitled &quot;My Secret Mother: Lorna Moon&quot;. Fellow writer Carol Easton (author of &quot;No Intermission: The Life of Agnes de Mille&quot;) remarked: &quot;None of Richard de Mille&#x27;s extraordinary relatives, not even the legendary Cecil B. de Mille himself, could have invented this riveting true story of celebrity, passion, betrayal, and tragedy&quot;.

=== Writings on Carlos Castaneda ===
De Mille wrote &quot;Castaneda&#x27;s Journey: The Power and the Allegory&quot; in 1976, a book describing the detective work through which he said that Carlos Castaneda was a hoaxer and plagiarist and that don Juan is fictional. He edited a second book on the same subject, &quot;The Don Juan Papers&quot; in 1980, when he found that his exposé did not lead Castaneda&#x27;s most ardent followers to fall away. This book contains documents representing views of Castaneda across the spectrum.

<doc id="1165380" wikidata="Q174561" url="?curid=1165380" title="Kemco">
<text>, from Kotobuki Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Co., Ltd., is a Japanese video game developer and publisher established in 1984. It is headquartered in Kure, Hiroshima.

Its best known franchises are the &quot;Kid Klown&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot; series, developed by Sheffield-based English developers Gremlin Graphics.

==History==
Kemco was founded in 1984 as Kotobuki System Co., Ltd. to be the video game subsidiary of the multifaceted corporation Kotobuki Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (established in 1979). The name represents the initial letters of Kotobuki Engineering Manufacturing Co.

Kemco started by developing video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Although technically called Kotobuki System until 2004, the company was already using the brand Kemco on its first game &quot;Dough Boy&quot; in 1985.

From the late 1980s until the early 1990s, Kemco&#x27;s video games were distributed in North America by Seika Corporation of Torrance, California, under the joint label of Kemco * Seika.

In the 1990s, Kemco developed, ported, and published video games for several platforms including the NES, Super NES, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy. The company&#x27;s first North American subsidiary, Kemco America, operated from October 2, 1991, to January 24, 2000.

In 2001, Kemco USA was founded as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemco of Japan, especially targeting the American market.

In 2004, Kotobuki&#x27;s system development division split to become the company Kotobuki Solution Co., Ltd., keeping the Kemco video game brand in the spin-off.

Since the 2010s, Kemco has been primarily known for its mobile games. Kemco USA closed in 2007, but products continue to be released in North America through Kemco of Japan.

<doc id="1165381" wikidata="Q580766" url="?curid=1165381" title="Fenton, Staffordshire">
<text>Fenton is one of the six towns that amalgamated with Hanley, Tunstall, Burslem, Longton and Stoke-upon-Trent to form the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent in 1910, later raised to city status in 1925. Fenton is often referred to as &quot;the Forgotten Town&quot;, because it was omitted by local author, Arnold Bennett, from many of his works based in the area, including one of his most famous novels, &quot;Anna of the Five Towns&quot;.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name Fenton means &#x27;fen farm&#x27;.

===Administration===
Fenton started to become populated as a group of farms and private small-holdings were built there, alongside a lane running from the southern reaches of Hanley (by 1933 this lane was very busy and given the title of the A50).

Around the 1750s, the land was commonly known as Fenton Vivian, after Vivian of Standon and his heirs, its lords in the thirteenth century. By the 1850s, the area around Duke Street and China Street had become populated during the rapid development of the Potteries.

Potters settled in Fenton in large houses alongside their potbanks. Such houses include Great Fenton Hall, Fenton House (home of the Baker family), Heron Cottage and Grove House.

The two principal districts, Fenton Vivian and Fenton Culvert – each with their scattered communities, were brought together to make an urban district with its own board of guardians in 1894.

On 1 April 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. By 1925, the area was granted city status.

===Industry===
Fenton has been the home to a number of potteries such as Coalport and Baker &amp; Co, and its architectural heritage includes listed bottle ovens.

===First World War===
During the First World War Fenton was bombed by Zeppelin &#x27;L 21&#x27;.

==Geography==
It is within easy reach of the A500, A34 and the A50, a short distance away from Longton, Hanley, Newcastle, and Stoke.

===Suburbs===
Although Fenton has large industrial plants, particularly from the pottery trade, it has always been considered more of a residential area.

Fenton includes Heron Cross, Mount Pleasant, Saxonfields, Pool Dole, Lane Delph and Fenpark.

==Places of interest==

Fenton Town Hall, which latterly served as the local magistrates&#x27; court, was commissioned by local pottery owner, William Meath Baker, at his own expense, to a design by Robert Scrivener and completed in 1888.

William Meath Baker was a very good friend of the great English composer, Sir Edward Elgar, who included him in his world-famous Enigma Variations (Variation IV).

Fenton Manor has a swimming pool, gym, and fitness centre, plus a 1,300-seater arena. Fenton Park has football pitches, pavilions, and a playground.

==Economy==
Fenton differs from the other Potteries towns in that it does not have a town centre. Instead, amenities and shops are spread over a sizeable area.

Fenton is home to the northern headquarters of Lister Windows, one of the UK’s leading manufacturers of uPVC and Aluminium windows and doors.

<text>The Mid-Norfolk Railway (MNR) is a preserved standard gauge heritage railway, one of the longest in Great Britain. Preservation efforts began in 1974, but the line re-opened to passengers only in the mid-1990s as part of the &quot;new generation&quot; of heritage railways. The MNR owns and operates most of the former Wymondham-Fakenham branch line of the Norfolk Railway. The branch opened in 1847, was closed to passengers in stages from 1964 to 1969 as part of the Beeching cuts, and was finally fully closed to goods traffic in 1989. (The northern section of this line, to Wells, was built by the Wells and Fakenham Railway and part of this has been operated by the Wells and Walsingham Light Railway since 1982.)

Regular steam and diesel services run through the centre of Norfolk between the market towns of Wymondham and Dereham via , and , and occasional sightseer services continue north of Dereham passing the nearby village of Hoe, where there is no station, to the limit of the operational line at Worthing. The line is periodically used for commercial freight operations and staff instruction for mainline railway companies. The company owns the line to a point just beyond County School railway station, which will make it the third longest heritage railway in England once restoration is complete.

The MNR is owned and operated by the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust (MNRPT, a charitable company limited by guarantee), and is mostly operated and staffed by volunteers. The railway is listed as exempt from the UK Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2000.

==History==

===Route history===

The Wymondham to Wells branch was opened in stages between 15 February 1847 and 1857, after Parliamentary consent was given in 1845. The entire line became part of the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. The Wymondham to Dereham section received double track in 1882, while the line north of there remained single track.

Along with the rest of the Great Eastern Railway, the branch became part of the Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway when the various British railway companies were grouped into four large companies in 1923. The line was heavily used during World War I and World War II, with extra Air Ministry sidings provided at Dereham in 1943. In the early days of the war, Dereham was used as a reception centre for the construction materials used to build the local airfields.

The nationalisation of the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies placed the line as part of the Eastern Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The branch line between County School and closed to passengers on 15 September 1952, with the section between and closing to goods as well. A stub of the western section, between County School and Foulsham remained open for goods until 31 October 1964, being busiest in the sugar beet season.
The passenger service between Dereham and Wells ended on 5 October 1964. Dereham became an intermediate station for Norwich to King&#x27;s Lynn services. In June 1965, the Wymondham to Dereham section was reduced to single track with a passing loop at Hardingham. The passenger service from King&#x27;s Lynn ended on 9 September 1968, with the &quot;Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway Society&quot; operating the &#x27;East Anglian Branch Line Farewell&#x27; DMU special on the final Saturday. The withdrawal of the remaining passenger services, between Wymondham and Dereham, followed in October 1969.

Goods traffic continued after the passenger closure. The 1973 oil crisis led to a meeting being held at Dereham in 1974 by the Railway Development Society in order to petition for the restoration of passenger services between Wymondham and Fakenham. British Rail gave a price of £247,000 for such a restoration, but this proposal was rejected by Norfolk County Council. This meeting resulted in the formation of the Wymondham, Dereham and Fakenham Railway Action Committee.

In 1977 the Wymondham, Dereham and Fakenham Railway Action Committee presented the Norfolk County Chief Planning Officer with a report putting the case for restoring rail passenger services between Norwich, Dereham and Fakenham East. Services over the line ceased in June 1989.
===Preservation===

====Fakenham and Dereham Railway Society====
Fakenham &amp; Dereham Railway Society (F&amp;DRS), a forerunner of the MNR, was formed in 1978. The 1980 constitution of the society included its aim:
In 1980 the F&amp;DRS attempted to preserve the Ryburgh to Fakenham section of line failed, and the society instead leased Hardingham station in 1983. The small heritage centre had track re-laid in the former goods yard, and acquired a Ruston 0-4-0 diesel locomotive. The centre was commercially unsuccessful, forcing the society to leave the site—which was auctioned in 1986—and move to a temporary location at Yaxham station.

In 1987 Breckland District Council bought the station at County School, and granted the F&amp;DRS a 999-year lease, inviting the society to re-lay track and relocate to the site. The intention was to re-connect the station with British Rail&#x27;s railhead at North Elmham to connect with charter trains operating over the branch. This plan was abandoned when the complete closure of the line from June 1989 was announced.

====Mid-Norfolk Railway Society and Great Eastern Railway (1989) Ltd.====

In response to the approaching closure of the entire branch between Wymondham, Dereham and North Elmham, the Great Eastern Railway (1989) Limited formed to save the line. The F&amp;DRS backed this scheme, and signed its lease of County School station over to the company. The society, renamed the Mid-Norfolk Railway Society in 1990, continued to provide financial backing and manpower for the development of the County School site. The running line was extended over towards North Elmham, and a collection of rolling stock was built up. The first passenger train, a Mk2 brake coach converted to work as a DBSO with an industrial diesel locomotive, operated at the County School site on 2 November 1991.

On 21 April 1990 the constitution of the organisation amended the aims of the society:
In 1991 the managing director of the GER (1989) Ltd. stated that he had raised much of the required finance and that the company intended to provide a regular passenger train service over the line by 1993. About 400 commuters a day were expected to use the service. Plans were also announced for special excursions such as shopping trips to London and summer seaside services. The plans included providing a hotel and conference centre at Dereham, along with a public house and shopping arcade.

During the early 1990s the GER(1989), contrary to the earlier announcements relating to the future of the line, announced plans to lift the railway between Dereham and Wymondham. The MNRS withdrew their support for the GER(1989) and made their own bid for the line.

In 1994 the British Railways Property Board granted the MNRS access to the railway line between Wymondham and North Elmham on a temporary &#x27;care and maintenance&#x27; basis. This was in response to increasing levels of vandalism occurring at the site, a problem which had worsened after the Great Eastern company had lifted the track between Norwich Road level crossing and a point just north of the Automatic Open Level Crossings. The first working party was held at Dereham station on Saturday 23 July 1994.

In December 1994 Class 20 diesels 20069 and 20206 were moved by road from County School to the truncated railhead at Dereham. On Christmas Eve, with permission from British Rail, both locomotives made their way along the line to Yaxham station.

In 1995 Yorkshire Bank called in the receivers to solve concerns with the Great Eastern Railway (1989) Ltd. In June 1995 Breckland Council informed the receivers that they wished for the GER (1989) Ltd. to give up the lease for County School station so that they could review their operations in respect of the site. The GER (1989) Ltd., who stated that they were attracting 12,000 visitors a year to the site, announced that they would contest this decision.

In July 1995, police were called in to investigate the sudden and unauthorised road transfer of two Mid-Norfolk Railway Society Mk 2 coaches to a breaker&#x27;s yard at nearby Lenwade. In July 1996 Breckland District Council issued a threat to stop trains running at County School station, as it was found that someone other than the leaseholder was operating trains at the site; the lease being non-transferable. In November 1996 Breckland District Council brought in 24-hour security guards at the County School site in order to prevent the stripping of the property after having served an eviction order on the GER(1989) in mid-October.

County School station was boarded up and GER (1989) Ltd rolling stock was concentrated in the isolated yard prior to disposal or scrapping. All track north of the station platforms was lifted, and, as shown in the photograph, the site was left to become derelict.
====Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust====


The Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust (MNRPT) was formed in 1995 through the merger of the campaign groups and organisations that had been trying to restore passenger services over the route since 1974. The aims of the new charity were established:

In July 1995 two Mk2 coaches were transferred by road from County School railway station to the truncated railhead at Dereham, where they were placed between the already present Class 20 locomotives. These coaches were then hauled to the MNR&#x27;s temporary base at Yaxham. A further three coaches were delivered on 17 August.

On 29 November 1995 the section of railway between Yaxham station and a temporary halt built beside a footpath crossing on the Rash&#x27;s Green industrial estate in Dereham was inspected by Chris Hall, H.M. Principal Inspecting Officer of Railways. Permission to operate passenger trains over this section was granted from Saturday 23 December 1995. 63 trains, each composed of the five Mk2 coaches topped and tailed by the Class 20s, were operated between this date and 14 January 1996. In October 1995 Breckland District Council established a rail working party to consider purchasing the line from British Rail, then leasing it out to a rail group – of which the Mid-Norfolk Railway was the preferred lessee.

On 11 April 1998 the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust bought the route between Wymondham and Dereham for £100,000. This included the Dereham station buildings and the goods yard. The British Rail Property Board also sold the of track between Dereham and North Elmham for £25,000. On 17 March 1998 the MNRPT had signed a Tenancy at Will agreement with Breckland District Council to take over the station and trackbed at County School. This agreement was to allow the railway to take control of the station until it could afford to buy it outright, and followed on from the removal of the remaining rolling stock associated with the defunct Great Eastern Railway (1989) Ltd from the site.

The original Dereham station was re-opened to passengers on Saturday 26 July 1997, with the first services being operated by 1890-built Manning Wardle 0-6-0T &#x27;Sir Berkeley&#x27;, hired from the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway. British Railways Board (Residuary) Limited transferred the line between Wymondham and Dereham to the MNRPT on 23 September 1997. The first preservation-era train to operate between Dereham and Wymondham ran on 8 February 1998, when a works train hauled by 20069 and Ruston &amp; Hornsby 0-4-0 &#x27;County School ran as part of preparations for a March freight test train. The first commercial freight train operated on 8 July 1998.

Passenger services between Dereham and Wymondham commenced in 1999, with the opening of Wymondham Abbey railway station. The first passenger train to use the new station, on 2 May 1999, was operated by a Class 108 DMU. Thuxton station opened as a daylight hours only request halt at the same time, although Kimberley Park and Hardingham remained closed.

Following the completion of infrastructure work, such as the replacement of the water tower at Dereham and the provision of an inspection pit, steam passenger services returned to the Dereham to Wymondham Abbey section on Sunday 30 April 2006. These were operated by Great Western Railway pannier tank number 9466 from the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The ownership of the section of railway line between Dereham and North Elmham, part of that originally authorised by the Norfolk Railway Extensions, Dereham, Wells and Blakeney Branch Act 1846, was passed to the Mid-Norfolk Railway in October 2001.

Part of the line from County School to Wroxham is now the narrow gauge Bure Valley Railway. The formation between Wells and the religious centre of Walsingham now hosts the miniature Wells and Walsingham Light Railway. Both schemes are independent of the MNR. Another independent scheme, the &quot;Norfolk Orbital Railway&quot; plans to link the MNR to the North Norfolk Railway and the coast at Sheringham. In 2009, the Whitwell &amp; Reepham Preservation Society announced an eventual intention to link up with either the North Norfolk Railway or Mid-Norfolk Railway.

The Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust is authorised by the Department for Transport to operate the railway in two statutory instruments, The Mid-Norfolk Railway Order 1997 and The Mid-Norfolk Railway Order 2001. The orders detail the length of track and level crossings over which the railway is permitted to operate trains (subject to safety inspections etc.) and refer to both the Norwich and Brandon Railway Act 1845 and the Norfolk Railway Extensions, Dereham, Wells and Blakeney Branch Act 1846. Planning consent for the restoration and operation of the remaining section to County School, which does not involve crossing any public rights of way but is to include the retention of a permissive footpath, was awarded in 1992.

==Present day==


The section of line between Dereham and Wymondham is in regular use, with a further to Worthing passed for operation, but only used for passengers during special events and for works trains enabling the reconditioning of the derelict line further north. The company also owns the next of disused line from Worthing to County School station near North Elmham, although a section of about lacks track between North Elmham and County School. This makes the Mid-Norfolk Railway one of the longest standard-gauge heritage railways in the United Kingdom. Beyond the railway&#x27;s holding, the trackbed is mostly intact from County School to Fakenham, and is reserved by the council for railway use.

The MNR&#x27;s preserved stations include Yaxham (which retains its original signal box and up platform buildings.), Thuxton, Hardingham, Kimberley Park and Wymondham Abbey. Trains hauled by both steam and diesel locomotives run on most weekends from the end of February to December, and on Wednesdays and Thursdays in summer. There are also various special events throughout the year.

===Guest steam locomotives===
Although predominantly diesel-operated, the MNR is not a diesel-only railway. The first train from after preservation, running between Dereham and Yaxham, was hauled by Manning Wardle tank locomotive &quot;Sir Berkeley&quot;, and the railway has always intended to operate both steam and diesel trains.

In 2000, the railway arranged the loan of Barclay &#x27;Little Barford&#x27;. Although the locomotive was too small to operate a scheduled service over the line it was used for a number of crew training runs, and, on Monday 12 June 2000, it became the first steam locomotive in preservation to operate over the entire route between Dereham and Wymondham. Steam also visited the line, although not to operate services, in 2001 when LNER Thompson Class B1 61264 was routed via Dereham for repairs after failing on railtour at Norwich, 20 November.

The 2006 return of steam-hauled passenger services marked the completion of Dereham Station restoration and the installation of steam infrastructure (such as the water tower).

The first locomotive to haul timetabled steam services over the Dereham to Wymondham section since 1955 was GWR 9400 Class 9466. The same locomotive returned to operate the line&#x27;s steam services in June and July 2007, although Battle of Britain class 34067 &quot;Tangmere&quot; also visited this year, operating some scheduled trains and hauling the first steam charter from Dereham (to London Liverpool Street), on 5 May. Steam services have continued to operate during summer months.

===Network Rail connections===

====Commercial freight====



Mid-Norfolk Railway facilitates commercial freight trains, using its connection with the National Rail network at Wymondham. Dereham yard has been used as a servicing depot by Direct Rail Services since 2007 and for storage of Network Rail track plant since 2008.

The road vehicle loading ramp in Dereham yard is used by mainline train operators to load damaged rolling stock onto road vehicles. Such rolling stock usually comes at night (via the connection with the mainline at Wymondham) at slow speed (sometimes on wheelskates) from Crown Point TMD in Norwich (where no road-rail loading facilities are available) for onward road movement to specialist repair facilities around the country.

The line has also been used to carry equipment for army units based at Robertson Barracks or undergoing training at the Stanford Training Area, most recently in March 2020. Operation of these trains involves both resident and mainline locomotives.

North Norfolk District Council have listed Fakenham and Great Ryburgh as potential freight hubs, subject to them being linked to the Mid-Norfolk Railway at County School.
Commercial works trains operated on the line between 2018 and 2019, in conjunction with the Kimberley and Hardingham storage project. These were operated by a number of locomotives hired in for the purpose. These included BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T steam locomotive &quot;80078&quot;, BR Class 03 &quot;03197&quot; and BR Class 33 &quot;33202&quot;.

====Storage of mainline stock====

Working with Abellio Greater Anglia, the Mid-Norfolk Railway have developed a rolling stock storage facility close to their Kimberley Park station. The £3 million sidings have been funded by Abellio Greater Anglia to allow them to store their Class 745 and 755 fleets until they are ready to be in service.

====Training and testing====

The Mid-Norfolk Railway is frequently used by mainline companies for crew training and the storage and testing of recommissioned and new on-track plant, including ballast tampers, ballast regulators, stoneblowers and Multi-Purpose Vehicles from companies including Network Rail and Balfour Beatty Rail Ltd. Since 2001 the line has been used annually for low adhesion training, or skidpan training, for crews from Anglia Railways, latterly for National Express East Anglia, where a specially fitted Class 153 treats the track with a slimy solution before the crew practices stopping in a virtual station.

The line has also been used for training exercises by East of England Ambulance Service, Norfolk Police and the Fire Brigade, including major incident training involving air ambulances.

====Charter trains====

Before the preservation of the line, a number of special trains and demonstration services were operated over the line by the Wymondham &amp; Dereham Rail Action Committee (WyDRAC) and the Railway Development Society (RDS) to help maintain pressure for the restoration of passenger services over the line. By the line&#x27;s closure, twenty special trains had operated, carrying over 5,000 passengers.

The junction with the main line at Wymondham has allowed the Mid-Norfolk Railway to continue to be used by a number of charter and excursion trains, which operate over the line as part of the wider rail network.


===Television, film and theatre use===
After passenger closure, County School station was used as the set for Weavers Green station in the Anglia Television soap opera of the same name. The same station, heavily disguised, featured as &quot;Gare de Nouvion&quot; (Nouvion railway station) in the penultimate episode of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!, the comedy series set in occupied France (see picture).

An episode of &quot;Off the Rails&quot; made for Discovery Channel in 2001 featured some to the activities and volunteers on the railway.

In February 2004 County School stood in for Thetford station in a documentary about the arrival of American troops in World War II, and in September 2005 the same location was used by Capriol Films for the film &quot;Peter Warlock, Some Little Joy&quot; about composer Philip Heseltine.
 Dereham station, with the railway&#x27;s Mark 2 coaches, featured in a minor film and the line has also appeared in documentaries for local and national television.

In 2010 former Conservative cabinet minister turned broadcaster and writer Michael Portillo visited the railway to film material for an episode in the second series of the BBC series Great British Railway Journeys. The filming used the Mid-Norfolk&#x27;s green liveried 1957-built two carriage Class 101 Diesel Multiple Unit.

In 2012 Dereham railway station was used as a stage for productions of the musical The Railway Children, 2016 saw the line and Dereham station featured as &quot;Fallmarsh&quot; station in horror film &#x27;Possum&#x27;, and the line was used for the filming of the opening scenes of BBC drama &quot;Bodyguard&quot; in 2018. In the same year, Dereham station was also used as a location for a German advert for Leffe beer.

Mumbai-based Reliance Entertainment filmed a Bollywood version of The Girl on the Train at Dereham station in August 2019.

===Community railway===

The Mid-Norfolk Railway was established as a multi-functional line, with an intention to operate a community service in addition to tourist and freight services. The railway has also stated their belief that a commuter service between Dereham and Norwich remains a viable proposition, with the MNR either running the service themselves or working with an existing train operator. One obstacle on the MNR to running such services is the requirement to operate five manual gated level crossings between Dereham and Wymondham, although level crossing automation is a possibility in the future.

In June 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a document (Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network) calling for the restoration of services on a variety of former branch lines, including the Dereham branch. This £30m proposal would see regular services restored between Dereham and Norwich, operated subject to agreement with the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust.

In 2020, the railway announced that they had, in association with partner organisations including Greater Anglia, Norfolk County Council, Breckland District Council and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, bid for funding for a feasibility study into reopening the line for regular commuter services over their route. The plans to restore the line, and potentially extend it to Fakenham in time, have been backed by the George Freeman, MP for Mid-Norfolk. In June 2021, a bid was submitted to restore the Wymondham-Dereham line as part of the second round of the Restoring Your Railway fund. It was unsuccessful. A bid was re-submitted for the third round

In another role within the community, the railway has become a focus point for vintage rallies and other special events. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Dereham station was used as a venue for medical testing.

===Awards===

* County School station was presented with a Highly Commended certificate in the 1990 Ian Allan National Heritage Railway Awards. 
* Hardingham station was awarded the Ian Allan Heritage Award in 2001. 
* In 2012 the railway was awarded the Heritage Railway Association&#x27;s Modern Traction Award for &quot;its continued excellence in specialising in the operation of 1970s stock in BR 1970s livery, culminating in a significant bringing together of Nine Class 47 locomotives, approximately 10% of the surviving fleet&quot;.

==Route details==
Heading south from the former station site at Fakenham, the route of the line passes over the former Midland &amp; Great Northern route to King&#x27;s Lynn. Published plans would see a spur, proposed during the original construction of the latter line, being constructed enabling a new station to be located close to the town&#x27;s former gas works. The line then passes over the River Wensum, with this first section being owned by the Norfolk Orbital Railway, in readiness for future restoration. At this time, it is open to the public as a permissive footpath.

The formation then passes along the rear boundary fence of the Pensthorpe Natural Park. After final closure in 1981 the platform at Ryburgh was cut back and the formation is blocked by temporary maltings structures and a private access driveway. The closure of the station was raised in the House of Commons due to concerns about whether the roads could cope with the volume of goods sent from the local maltings. This five mile section is not in rail ownership, but a section south of Great Ryburgh is open as a permissive footpath.

Although the line south of Great Ryburgh station is partially in use as a permissive footpath, two bridge decks have been removed and the section between these, running through Sennowe Park, is not open to the public. The formation is subject to Policy CT7 of Norfolk County Council&#x27;s adopted Core Strategy, with the track route corridor from Fakenham through to County school, the Northern station on the Mid-Norfolk railway being safeguarded for rail use. The railway line between bridge 1708 and the MNR boundary at Yarrow Lane level crossing is a Public Bridleway.

The Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust owned trackbed starts north of Yarrow Lane level crossing, in the Wensum valley; a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Candidate Special Area of Conservation, taking a roughly southerly direction.

The line south of the County School station is in the ownership of the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust, and has been partially relayed following planning consent for the restoration and operation of the line being granted in 1992. A one-mile gap remains between the Mid-Norfolk&#x27;s tracks at North Elmham and the relayed MNR track at County School, which much of the latter likely to also need to be replaced prior to the restoration of train services. The line runs through the Wensum Valley, with the only level crossing on this section being on a private road owned by the railway company, and no public highways being crossed.

After passing the remains of North Elmham station the line becomes operational, and runs to the rear of the historic RAF Swanton Morley, before passing the hamlet of Hoe before entering Dereham. There are six public road level crossings and several bridges on this section. The section is rarely in passenger use as no stations are open to passengers, and due to the lack of signalling systems in Dereham. This section of line climbs out of the Wensum valley and enters the town of Dereham, passing two of the town&#x27;s former maltings, including the Grade II* listed Crisps Malting buildings.

After passing through the company&#x27;s headquarters at Dereham station, the line runs through the town and open fields, passing over the River Tud, before arriving at the nearby village of Yaxham. This was the first section of the railway restored by the Mid-Norfolk Railway, when a temporary halt was provided at Rash&#x27;s Green (since abolished). The single track line continues through the one operational platform at the station, passing the Yaxham Light Railway, then running through a sequence of cuttings and embankments before reaching a level crossing at Garvestone where a station has previously been proposed. The line then descends to pass through the head of the Yare valley, dividing into double track for the extended passing loop and storage siding at Thuxton.


Work to complete a passing loop at Thuxton, provide operational signalling and lengthen the up platform to accommodate longer and more frequent train services was completed in 2010. The signalling is operated from a new signal box located beside the level crossing. The foundations of the waiting room on the up platform were left in place and are being reconstructed to provide passenger facilities at what is now the main passing point on the route. Double track extends for a considerable distance south of the station, having been relayed to serve as a storage siding. The single operating line, on the down formation, continues through fields to Hardingham.

The majority of trains pass through Hardingham without stopping, as there is no public right of way between the road and the station platforms. Double track extends southwards from the station, over Danemoor Bank – with the up formation being reserved for use as a storage siding. Approaching Kimberley, a large storage yard has been created on a former rail-served quarry site and part of the up formation as part of a contract to store mainline rolling stock.

After passing the sidings, and passing over a level crossing, the single track section continues southwards, passing the village of Wicklewood in a deep cutting. The restored windmill at Wicklewood can be seen to the west of the line, before the line drops into the Tiffey valley and then passing over the main Dereham to Wymondham road close to Crownthorpe before entering the Tiffey Valley and the outskirts of Wymondham. Most services terminate at a halt close to the Grade I listed Wymondham Abbey, a former Benedictine priory founded in 1107 and now serving as the Parish Church.

Wymondham Abbey has a reversing loop provided south of the adjacent level crossing, on the site of an original Norfolk Railway station (the foundations of which being discovered during works on the site). Although not open to regular services, the line continues a further before joining with the main line at Wymondham railway station. At this time this final section is not usually operated by passenger services.

The route of the MNR includes the following stations, listed from north to south:



There have been plans to create additional stations at Hoe, Garvestone and Wymondham Junction railway station on the boundary between MNR and NR, allowing a short walk from branch to main line.

==Engineering projects==
Large projects have been completed with help from European and Government funding, including restoration of Dereham station building, construction of a locomotive pit and provisions for steam working. Almost all the work, including maintaining the track and locomotives, running the trains and working the crossings, is by unpaid volunteers – although a condition of recent funding is the creation of a number of paid posts.

Other future projects include the installation of signalling at Dereham and Wymondham. The new Thuxton signal box was commissioned in summer 2015.

===Dereham station restoration===
Dereham station had, since closure, been totally stripped out and gutted by a major fire in 1988. In 2002 the line was awarded over £600,000 in grants from the European Union and the East of England Development Agency. This allowed the railway to restore the station and several associated buildings, including the two railway-owned crossing cottages and a World War II pillbox.

In June 2013 a planning application was approved by Breckland District Council for the construction of a footbridge at Dereham Station to link platforms 1 and 2. This was to involve the restoration and assembly of the original footbridge from Whittlesford station. In 2018 this footbridge was sold by the railway.

===Dereham traction and rolling stock shed===

In order to allow for restoration and maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock, the line decided to build a new shed in Dereham yard. In 2014 a suitable 18m x 55m building frame was located near Goole using eBay, purchased and brought to Dereham. The site in Dereham Yard was cleared and levelled in early 2015 with the spoil moved north of Hoe to widen an embankment using wagons hired for five days from Network Rail.

In 2018 a new traction and rolling stock maintenance shed was built, following the award of a £100,000 grant from the European Union. The grant from the EU Leader Fund&#x27;s Wensum and Coast Local Area Group amounted to 80% of the project&#x27;s total construction cost and is dependent on future job creation. The original shed frame purchased in 2014 on eBay has not been used and is in pieces in Dereham yard.

===Dereham turntable===
In March 2015 the Mid-Norfolk Railway secured the former Hitchin Turntable for installation at Dereham.

===Thuxton loop and signalling works===

The Mid-Norfolk Railway&#x27;s 2001 Bearer bond issue proposals included £60,000 for the provision of a passing loop at Hardingham. With this station being in private hands this proposal was abandoned in favour of a loop at Thuxton.

During 2008, the company began construction of the passing loop at Thuxton station to allow hourly departures from Dereham and Wymondham. Preparatory works were carried out late in 2008 and the first phase of work; installing the southern turn out commenced during January 2009, this was completed on schedule during February of the same year. Panels of track for the loop were laid, levelled and ballasted and the both turn outs installed by the end of 2009. The final major task on the track work will see the level crossing widened to accommodate the double track.

The loop was declared operational in September 2010, although with limited signalling working from a covered ground frame and part of the restored up platform remaining out of use. The first scheduled passenger trains to pass at Thuxton did so during the 2010 Autumn Diesel Gala, in which the railway operated at its most intensive service levels ever.

Full signalling will be included as part of the final project including five semaphore and two colour light signals along with two point motors to operate the turnouts. These will be controlled from a new signal box on site sourced from on the former King&#x27;s Lynn line. This project has also made the commissioning of the dormant Dereham Central signal box a priority for the company. As of 29 January 2009, over £25,000 has been raised towards the new works taking the appeal over half way.
Since becoming operational in September 2010, work has continued on the signalling, the signal box became operational during summer 2015 allowing the temporary ground frame and shed to be removed. A Trap point will be fitted to the exit of the siding south of Thuxton station, as well as additional signals including signals allowing bi-directional movements in the down platform and a ground frame at Garvestone crossing with associated gate locks and distant signals interlocked with Thuxton signal box. The completed scheme will allow the train from Wymondham to arrive before the train from Dereham when two trains are operating, this is not currently possible. Locomotives will also be able to run round their trains in the station.

===County School station restoration===

In 1998 the MNRPT signed a Tenancy at Will with Breckland District Council to take over the station and trackbed at County School. The track north of the platforms had been lifted with the remainder overgrown. The station was boarded up, with smashed glass, a stripped interior and broken windows.

The MNR returned the station to use, as a visitor centre rather than an operational railway museum. Over the next year, the MNR spent £28,000 restoring the station buildings to wartime LNER condition, tidying the grounds and removing scrap material left by the former lessee. With additional investment, the station drive, damaged after decades of neglect, was professionally resurfaced, scrub growth was removed from the railway formation opening up the views of the Wensum Valley for walkers, and formation for the restoration of track was prepared. The station and site was then sold for a nominal sum to the Mid-Norfolk Railway for railway use, and with the MNR agreeing to retain and maintain a permissive footpath previously established by Breckland Council over the purchased section of line.

===County School signal box===
The original signal boxes at County School were both demolished after passenger closure, but the locking room footings of the main box survived and were restored to allow for the delivery of the original signal cabin from Halesworth to be relocated to the site from Halesworth Middle School, where it had been displayed since 1986. On arrival it was found to be in much worse condition than anticipated, and in 2017, after further deterioration whilst at County School and with no immediate funds available for its restoration, the Mid-Norfolk Railway decided to allow the removal of the signalbox from the brick built locking room and transferred ownership of it to the Mangapps Railway Museum in Essex.

===Hardingham – Kimberley Park storage capacity===
Following months of negotiations in early 2018 with local train operating company Greater Anglia, a £3.25M agreement was reached to provide siding capacity for approximately 30 Class 755 multiple units.
Greater Anglia require a significant increase in siding capacity while they introduce their new fleet of trains as both the old and new fleets will be in East Anglia at the same time. The agreement was announced to the members of the MNRPT at the Trust&#x27;s AGM on 30 June 2018 with work commencing on site three weeks later. Construction of the sidings is being paid for from upfront storage charges paid by Greater Anglia. As the principal contractor is Sonic Rail Services of Burnham-on-Crouch, the project has been nicknamed &quot;Project Hedgehog&quot; by some of the MNR&#x27;s volunteers in honour of Sonic the Hedgehog.
The Class 755 units will be stored in the sidings during testing, commissioning and driver training prior to being used for passenger services.

The scheme included improving the signalling along the line to improve operational flexibility allowing access to the sidings for train movements and for machinery during the construction phase. This include a &quot;No-Signalman Key Token&quot; (NSKT) Electric Key Token system between Wymondham Abbey and Thuxton with intermediate instruments mid-section at the Ballast Pit Sidings and Hardingham.
Laying a fan of 5 sidings north of Kimberley Park on the site of an old Ballast Pit to the east of the line at the 4 mile post including a crossover and headshunt. The Up formation south of the accommodation crossing has been dug out of the embankment and levelled to allow the siding closest to the running line to be level.
Laying a new running line over Danemoor Bank and through the Up platform at Hardingham station. The Up line on Danemoor Bank becoming a long loop siding ending north of the accommodation crossing south of Danemoor Bank at Brick Kiln Grove. The new Down line becoming the new running line.
The project also included the installation of a connection into Hardingham yard for the various owners of the separate parts of the old yard in exchange for the land required to fit the double track past the yard.

===Dereham – Yaxham Road level crossing replacement===
In May 2020, the MNR replaced the life-expired components on the Yaxham Road level crossing in Dereham. The work saw the replacement of electronic equipment, the track beneath the road, replacement of the road surface and the upgrade of the crossing&#x27;s lights. A public appeal for funds for the work raised a total of £150,000.

This work included installing a modular crossing deck system developed by Edilon Sedra. Officials from both Network Rail and Transport for London visited the MNR during the installation with this type of crossing planned to be introduced on the wider UK rail network. A second Edilon Sedra crossing deck was installed at Kimberley Park station in May 2021.

===Route extension===
 
This project entails reopening the line north of Dereham to in stages, initially to (a hamlet near Gressenhall). The option to build a platform at Hoe using components from the former St Ives branch was considered but it has been decided to focus efforts on restoring the track to North Elmham where better access is available for visitors, although it will still be possible to add a platform at Hoe in the future if it is considered to be of benefit to the railway. The level crossing at Hoe has been rebuilt to accommodate widening of the road. Gradual sleeper replacement, drainage repair and vegetation clearance is ongoing towards North Elmham.

A railway inspector authorised by the Office of Rail Regulation inspected the section between Dereham and Hoe prior to the first passenger train using the track, the inspector set out rules governing the frequency of use and the necessary inspection regime that should be used on this section as well as the maximum speed permitted. The inspector limited the use of the line north of Dereham to 12 days per year for passenger trains due to the lack of operational signalling equipment in the Dereham station area and the absence of a Facing Point Lock on the points immediately north of Norwich Road level crossing, this legally means they must be clipped and locked manually prior to use by passenger trains. The speed limit north of Dereham is 15 mph due to the condition of the track, the speed limit could be increased by adding additional ballast.

The first full passenger train to operate over the section of line between Dereham and Hoe did so on 18 May 2013, being a main line InterCity 125 charter from London St Pancras station. On 19 May 2018 the line between Hoe and Worthing officially opened to passenger trains bringing the operational length of the railway to over 15 miles. The section north of Dereham will continue to be used on special event days only until full opening to a station at North Elmham is achieved.

On 4 March 2018, 5 &quot;Dogfish&quot; ballast hoppers were moved from the siding in Wymondham and used to drop ballast between Hoe and Worthing before being stabled just south of North Elmham level crossing. This was the first train to reach North Elmham from Wymondham since British Rail closed the line.

Planning permission for the relaying and operation of the line between County School and North Elmham was granted by Breckland District Council on 9 November 1992, with initial tracklaying starting soon after. This grants permission, associated with the original enabling act, to operate a railway north beyond the buffers north of North Elmham station (at ), where The Mid-Norfolk Railway Order 2001 ends.

The Mid-Norfolk Railway has long-term aims to restore the railway as far as Fakenham, and has held talks with North Norfolk District Council and Fakenham Town Council about restoring the route to a proposed new station close to the town centre. This would result in a -long route through the centre of Norfolk. The former railway route has been protected from development that would be prejudicial to the creation of railway transport links by North Norfolk District Council and Norfolk County Council.

====Norfolk Orbital Railway====

The Norfolk Orbital Line is a long term proposed railway of which the Mid-Norfolk Railway would form a significant part. It is an ambitious plan to form a line between Sheringham and Wymondham for regular passenger services, joining up with the Network Rail system at either end. These ambitions were aided on 2 January 2008 when Network Rail announced it was giving consideration to allowing construction of a limited use level crossing between the North Norfolk Railway and the Bittern branch line.

In 2009, the Norfolk Orbital Railway attempted to secure a section of the railway formation in Fakenham, but was outbid by a London developer who claimed not to know of the project. The land was once again auctioned on 10 December 2014, and was secured for the railway project for £24,000. In 2016 the project was awarded £60,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help repair the Fakenham bridges, provide an education resource, equipment for the Fakenham Area Conservation Team and to create a walk along the preserved formation for people to enjoy.

==Rolling stock==
The Mid-Norfolk Railway plays host to a large collection of locomotives, passenger carriages and wagons, most of which are from the 1950s to 1990s period. A variety of steam locomotives operate on the MNR throughout a season however, BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T 80078 has been on long term hire to the railway since 2018. Diesel locomotives also operate on the MNR, these include Class 03, Class 04, Class 31, Class 33, Class 37, Class 47 &amp; Class 50, along with Class 100, Class 101, Class 108, Class 117, Class 142 and Class 144 multiple units. Further information can be found on the separate Wiki page Rolling stock of the Mid-Norfolk Railway. 
==Funding and associated bodies==

The Mid-Norfolk Railway is owned and operated by Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust, a registered charity, with finance for the development of the line coming through the commercial operation of the railway and specific funding appeals. The opening of the line was partly funded by a loan from Breckland District Council of £50,000, repayable over 20 years commencing April 2003 and a loan of £25,000, repayable over 18 years commencing June 2001, from South Norfolk District Council. A grant of £50,000 was made by Norfolk County Council, £25,000 from Breckland D.C. and £12,500 from South Norfolk D.C.

In 2001 the railway launched a Bearer bond issue of up to £300,010, offering annual interest at 4% per annum as well as capital repayment after ten years. The nominal value of the Bonds was payable on 31 October 2011. The capital projects proposed for this scheme were:

:&quot;1. Part restoration of the Victorian station buildings, goods shed and stables at Dereham, along with the provision of sidings and maintenance facilities. Dereham was also to be provided with watering, coaling and disposal facilities for steam services. (£150,000)
:&quot;2. A runround facility was to be provided at Wymondham Abbey. (£20,000)
:&quot;3. A passing loop was to be provided at Hardingham. (£60,000)
:&quot;4. Essential preparatory work on track restoration on the Northern Section, towards North Elmham. (£25,000)
:&quot;5. Additional passenger rolling stock was to be purchased. (£25,000)&quot;

In 2018, the railway was awarded £100,000 from the European Union Leader Fund&#x27;s Wensum and Coast Local Area Group for a new traction and rolling stock maintenance shed. The same year saw Greater Anglia, complete a £3.25M agreement with the MNR to provide siding capacity at Kimberley.

In 2020, the line was awarded £190,500 from the Culture Recovery Fund, funded by the government and administered by Historic England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

The MNR also has several supporting bodies based on the line. The majority are locomotive or rolling stock groups. Private owners have based their stock or locomotives at the line.
The Class 37 Locomotive Group was formed in 1984. The group maintains and operates 37003, which arrived at Dereham in February 2009.

The Stratford 47 Group formed in 2001 to save a Class 47 diesel formerly at Stratford depot in East London. It now owns one locomotive which is 47367 &quot;Kenny Cockbird&quot; which is operational on the Mid-Norfolk Railway.

The Class 50 Locomotive Association bought 50019 &quot;Ramillies&quot; in September 1991. Originally on the Spa Valley Railway, it moved to the Mid-Norfolk Railway in May 1999.

The North Norfolk Model Engineering Club are setting up a miniature railway at the MNR&#x27;s County School terminus.

<text>Pyramid is a patience or solitaire game of the Simple Addition family, where the object is to get all the cards from the pyramid to the foundation.

The object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to a total of 13, the equivalent of the highest valued card in the deck, from a pyramid arrangement of 28 cards. When using the standard 52-card deck, Jacks are valued at 11, Queens at 12, and Kings at 13. Under the strictest rules, the odds of winning are around 1 in 50.

==Rules==
To set up the pyramid, one card is dealt face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on completing with a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt (or six rows of 21 cards). The remaining cards are placed to the side face down, and make up the Stock.

To play, pairs of uncovered cards can be removed to the foundation if their values total 13. Thus, kings can be removed immediately to the foundation. In order to be removed, cards must not be covered, so when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed. Discarded cards are removed from play and cannot be re-matched with other cards.

You may draw cards from the stock one at a time and match them with any exposed card. If no match is made, the drawn stock card is played into a waste pile. The top card of the waste pile can be matched at any time with the next card drawn from the stock, or any uncovered card in the pyramid. Once the stock is exhausted and/or no more pairs can be made, the game ends. (A variation, Par Pyramid, allows the waste to be turned over and dealt as a new stock twice.)

To score, count the number of remaining face up cards in the pyramid. A perfect score is therefore zero, where all cards have been matched into the Foundation.

To be considered won, all cards (cards from the pyramid and cards from the stock) must be moved to the foundation.

==Variations==

Given the popularity of Pyramid, many different variants exist which alter aspects of the game, including the following:
* Relaxed Pyramid: To be considered won, only the cards from the pyramid must be moved to the foundation, so the game can be won with cards still left in the stock or waste.
* Tut&#x27;s Tomb (also called King Tut): Dealing three cards at a time from the stock, repeating until no matches can be made; placing all cards totalling 13 in a stack. The King of Spades is laid down first, and represents King Tutankhamen atop a pyramid.
* Apophis: Using three waste piles instead of one.
* Giza: In a version created by Michael Keller, after the pyramid is formed, the rest of the deck is dealt as three rows of eight cards (i.e. eight columns of three overlapping cards) with the exposed cards open to match the exposed cards from the pyramid or other exposed cards.
* Triangle: The initial deal consists of an inverted pyramid.
* Redeals may be allowed.
* A reserve of seven (or six) cards is dealt below the pyramid. These cards can match each other exposed cards in the pyramid or from the stack.
* Playing with a cell, filled either from the tableau or from the waste upcard.

Several variations allow a card on the pyramid to be removed in combination with a card covered by the first, so long as neither card is covered by a card not in the combo. For example, in the case of an exposed ace resting on a queen, the queen can be removed with the ace if no other cards are covering them, but if (for example) a jack is also on the queen, the queen cannot be removed. Other versions require that both cards be fully exposed to begin with.

When playing with a 48-card Spanish deck the highest valued cards are the Kings at 12, and thus pairs of exposed cards can be removed if their values total 12.

A variation of the game was released on the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2 in 1991, under the name Tut&#x27;s Tomb. It has also been added to Microsoft Solitaire Collection for Windows 8, Windows 10, Android, and iOS. When the game is played through Microsoft Solitaire Collection, the cards in the Stock are face-up rather than face-down.

<text>The University of Aveiro () is a public university, in addition to providing polytechnic education, located in the Portuguese city of Aveiro. Founded in 1973, it has a student population of approximately 12,500, distributed among 58 graduate, 40 Masters of Science and 25 PhD programs, distributed by departments and autonomous sections, with specialized faculties. It is a Research &amp; Development university, with research departments developing programmes in fundamental and applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, telecommunications, robotics, bioinformatics, sea sciences, materials, design, business administration and industrial engineering.

The main campus and nearby Administration and Accounting Institute, are located in the city centre of Aveiro. There are external/regional campuses in Águeda (Higher Education Technological and Management School of Águeda) and Oliveira de Azeméis (Higher Education School of North Aveiro). It serves as a pole for the inter-university Doctoral program, along with the universities of Porto and Minho. Its integrated Masters in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering was the first Portuguese IT oriented European Accredited Engineering Masters (EUR-ACE) by the European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education.

==History==


On 15 December 1973, at the inaugural speech of Professor José Veiga Simão, then Minister of National Education () the new rector, stated:
:&quot;&quot;In the peaceful construction of the future and in defense of sacred and enduring values, here will rise the University of Aveiro.&quot;
Announced in a speech at the Museum of Aveiro, the event was held to mark the first meeting of the commission establishing the University of Aveiro, that included José Simão and other members of academic society and Aveiro. The first pedagogical and scientific activities began in 1974, with first days classes in the telecommunication course, comprising 46 students.

The licentiate courses established at the University of Aveiro (UA) were the first courses in innovative areas, that were not explored by traditional universities at the time in Portugal, but important to regional or national initiatives. By 1976 there were courses in environmental science and education, natural sciences and education, mathematics and education, Portuguese-English and education and Portuguese-French and education. The student population included 338. It was only in that year that the first infrastructure were established in the area later known as the University Campus of Santigao ().

During the 1977–1978 lecture year, there was a proposal to create a pilot project: the first &quot;Centro Integrado de Formação de Professores&quot; (CIFOP), today the Integrated Unit for Continuing Education (), in the country. At UA, the intention was to establish a training institute for professors/teachers, from infant education to secondary school, using the latest pedagogical resources and innovative methods. The project was headed by Professor João Evangelista Loureiro, the former vice-rector at UA.

A period of consolidation occurred at the university in the 1980s, resulting in internal regulation and the creation of fundamental bodies (during the mandate of the second rector Dr. José Mesquita Rodrigues) as well as the conclusion of the purchase of lands for the campus, later completed during the mandate of Dr. Renato Araújo. By the end of the 1980s (specifically 24 September 1988), the law for university autonomy, permitted the consolidation of the university organic laws, and homologation of the university statutes, in June 1989. Meanwhile, a team coordinated by architect Nuno Portas, had begun selecting among various prestigious Portuguese architects in 1986 to design the Santigao University Campus, that fell in line with their attempt to harmonize the structures with the architectural heritage of the city. Many of the buildings, therefore, were designed by internationally recognized architects, among them: Alcino Soutinho, Álvaro Sisa Vieira, Pedro Ramalho, Luís Ramalho, José Maria Lopo Prata, Eduardo Souto Moura, Adalberto Dias, Rebello de Andrade, Jorge Kol de Carvalho, Gonçalo Byrne and Figueiredo Dias, whose works have annually been visited by national and international specialists. By the mid-1980s teaching had expanded with innovative courses in Environment, Industrial Management, Music, Tourism, Chemical Industry and New Technologies.

The 1990s was marked by a new phase at UA, with priorities redefined to position the university towards internationalization and cooperation, namely European programs, reinforcing relationships with Portuguese-speaking and Latin states, and building protocols between international institutes, organs and companies abroad. In parallel there were initiatives in continuing education, distance learning and improving student satisfaction and quality. In 1994, an Internet search engine, SAPO, was created in this university. Since 1998, the university has been developing an ecological motor vehicle, Ícaro, aiming to run the largest distance with the smallest amount of consumed fuel, having participated in the international competition Shell Eco-marathon.

During the second mandate of the fourth rector, Dr. Júlio Pedrosa, the student population was 8000, and the university had the most number of internationally recognized programs. During 25th anniversary celebrations, UA advanced with the integration of polytechnical study into early training programs. The creation of the Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão de Águeda (in 1997), the integration of the Instituto de Contabilidade e Administração de Aveiro (in 1999), the implementation of the Escola Superior de Saúde (in 2000), and the implementation of a polytechnical school in the northern district, the Escola Superior Aveiro-Norte], was part of this process of integration. In 2012–13, it was ranked 351–400 in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; World University rankings. Rankings

The first mandate of its sixth rector, Dr. Maria Helena Nazaré, was marked by the start of professional program in technology (2002–2003). Since 2009, it has hosted a SexLab aimed at studying sexual health.

In February 2010 Professor Manuel António de Assunção took charge as the seventh rector, a position held for two mandates until May 2018. During this time he promoted the establishment of the Fábrica – Centro de Ciência Viva de Aveiro.

On 8 May 2018 Dr. Paulo Jorge Ferreira took office as the eight rector.

==Culture==
The university hosts &quot;3810-UA&quot;, a weekly national public television program.

In mid-spring, a one-week break from formal studies is allowed, wherein anyone may participate in academic activities, concerts or Enterro do Ano, a local academic parade.

The university is a regular participant or organizer of robotics inter-university or inter-school competitions, i.e.: Micro-Rato (hardware robotics) and Cyber-Rato (behavioral software). In 2008, one of its teams won the Robocup world competition, in China.

The university occasionally organizes mathematics competitions, mostly aimed at pre-university level students.

==University Campus Santiago==
The university architecture is modern, with more than 25 buildings.

As an organization, the university is composed of departments (one of them built by Eduardo Souto de Moura), autonomous sections, research units, administrative and service facilities, a library (built by Álvaro Siza), a mediateque, a field track, a multisports building with gym, a residential complex, green spaces, ecological spots and parking lots. The rectory (built by Gonçalo Byrne) is located in a white building near the campus centre.

The campus also has an entire Administration and Accounting Institute, which has its own service facilities and parking lots.

==Research==

The projects developed by UA are developed under 20 research centres, of many different scientific areas:

# Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM)
# Center for Research in Higher Education Policies (CIPES)

<doc id="1165401" wikidata="Q1111402" url="?curid=1165401" title="Colorado State Capitol">
<text>The Colorado State Capitol Building, located at 200 East Colfax Avenue in Denver, Colorado, United States, is the home of the Colorado General Assembly and the offices of the Governor of Colorado, Lieutenant Governor of Colorado, and the Colorado State Treasurer.

== History ==
The building is intentionally reminiscent of the United States Capitol. Designed by Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed in the 1890s from Colorado white granite, and opened for use in November 1894. The distinctive gold dome consists of real gold leaf, first added in 1908, commemorating the Colorado Gold Rush. The building is part of Denver&#x27;s Civic Center area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Civic Center Historic District in 1974, and became part of the Denver Civic Center National Historic Landmark District in 2012.

A major safety upgrade project, funded by the Colorado State Historical Fund, was started in 2001 and completed in 2009. The design by Fentress Architects added modern safety features, like enclosed stair towers, that blended in with the original architecture. The Colorado Capitol Building is featured on many of Denver&#x27;s architectural tours.

== Building ==
Serving as the beginning of the Capitol Hill district, the historic building sits slightly higher than the rest of downtown Denver. The main entrance hall is open 180 feet (55 m) to the top of the dome, about the height of an 18-story building. Additionally, the official elevation of Denver is measured outside the west entrance to the building, where the fifteenth step is engraved with the words &quot;One Mile Above Sea Level&quot;. From this step, at , the sun can be seen setting behind the Rocky Mountains. A second mile high marker was set in the 18th step in 1969 when Colorado State University students resurveyed the elevation. In 2003, a more accurate measurement was made with modern means, and the 13th step was identified as being one mile (1.6 km) high, where a 3rd marker was installed.

=== Materials ===
The superstructure of the building was constructed using granite from the Aberdeen Quarry near Gunnison, Colorado. Approximately or 24,000 tons of the granite were quarried for the building. This gray granite forms the exterior of the building. The interior of the building uses a large amount of Colorado Rose Onyx, a rare rose marble from a quarry near Beulah, Colorado. The amount used in the building consumed the entire known supply. White Yule Marble from the quarries near Marble, Colorado was also used throughout the capitol for the floors. Many designs have been found in the marble including an image resembling George Washington and another of Molly Brown.

Many of the windows are made of stained glass, depicting people or events related to the history of Colorado. The halls are decorated with portraits of every president of the United States, with all the presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush being painted by Lawrence Williams. Painter Sarah A. Boardman took over from Williams, and has since painted Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. Colorado artist Kirsten Savage painted President Joe Biden&#x27;s portrait. One of the contractors for the construction of the Colorado State Capitol building was Illinois building contractor William Douglas Richardson, who was the president of the W. D. Richardson Construction Company. Richardson had participated in numerous major building contracts throughout the United States, and was interconnected with the Jacob Bunn and John Whitfield Bunn network of corporations.

<text>Gerrit Smith (March 6, 1797 – December 28, 1874), also spelled Gerritt Smith, was an American social reformer, abolitionist, businessman, public intellectual, and philanthropist. Married to Ann Carroll Fitzhugh, Smith was a candidate for President of the United States in 1848, 1856, and 1860. He served a single term in the House of Representatives from 1853 to 1854.

First valedictorian of the new Hamilton College (1818), and married to the daughter of the college president, he had &quot;a fine mind&quot;, with &quot;a strong literary bent and a marked gift for public speaking&quot;. He was called &quot;the sage of Peterboro.&quot; He was well liked, even by his political enemies. The many who appeared at his house in Peterboro, invited or not, were well received. (In 1842 the names of 132 visitors were recorded.)

Smith, one of the wealthiest men in New York, was committed to political reform, and above all to the elimination of slavery. So many fugitive slaves came to Peterboro to ask for his help (usually, in reaching Canada) that there is a book about them. Peterboro was, because of Smith, the capital of the abolition movement. The only assembly of escaped slaves (as opposed to free Blacks) ever to meet in the United States—the Fugitive Slave Convention of 1850—took place in neighboring Cazenovia because Peterboro was too small for the meeting.

Smith was also, and less successfully, a temperance activist, and a women&#x27;s rights suffrage advocate. He was a significant financial contributor to the Liberty Party and the Republican Party throughout his life. Besides making substantial donations of both land and money to create Timbuctoo, an African-American community in North Elba, New York, he was involved in the temperance movement and the colonization movement, before abandoning colonization in favor of abolitionism, the immediate freeing of all the slaves. He was a member of the Secret Six who financially supported John Brown&#x27;s raid at Harpers Ferry, in 1859. Brown&#x27;s farm, in North Elba, was on land he bought from Smith.

==Early life==
===Forebears===
Smith was born in Utica, New York, when it was still an unincorporated village. He was one of four children of Peter Gerrit Smith (1768–1837), whose ancestors were from Holland (Gerrit is a Dutch name), and Elizabeth (Livingston) Smith (†1818), daughter of Col. James Livingston and Elizabeth (Simpson) Livingston. Peter, an actor as a young man, and who coached Gerrit in public speaking, was a slave owner, the first judge in Madison County, and the largest landholder in New York State. &quot;In partnership with John Jacob Astor in the fur trade and alone in real estate, Peter Smith [had] managed to amass a considerable fortune. Peter was the county judge of Madison County, New York, and has been described as &#x27;easily its leading citizen&#x27;.&quot; He was &quot;a devout and emotionally religious man&quot;. From 1822 on, Peter Smith was intensely engaged in the work of the Bible and tract societies.&quot;

The author of the only book on Peter calls him greedy, self-centered, driven by the search for profits, and someone who did not like people who were not like him: white, male, and Dutch. He was not philanthropic. &quot;Other people...[were] objects to be used for his own benefit, especially if they were culturally different than himself. Native Americans, poor people, black people, and non-Christians he viewed with disrespect.&quot;

Peter spent his last years in a religious fanaticism that led him to give up all his worldly goods. He turned over a $400,000 business [] to his son Gerrit in 1819 and bequeathed $800,000 more [] to his children in 1837. Gerrit also inherited of land from his father, and at one point he owned , an area bigger than Rhode Island. Another source says that he inherited from his father over one million acres in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. An 1846 listing of lands he was offering for sale fills 45 pages.

Gerrit had an older brother, Peter Smith Jr., who was a problem drinker that died young, and a younger brother Adolph, who was &quot;clinically insane and confined to a nearby institution.&quot;
Smith&#x27;s maternal aunt, Margaret Livingston, was married to Judge Daniel Cady. Their daughter Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a founder and leader of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, was Smith&#x27;s first cousin. Elizabeth Cady met her future husband, Henry Stanton, also an active abolitionist, at the Smith family home in Peterboro, New York. Established in 1795, the town had been founded by and named for Gerrit Smith&#x27;s father, Peter Smith, who built the family homestead there in 1804. Another source says that Peter Smith moved to Whitesboro &quot;about 1803&quot; and that he removed to Peterboro in 1806. Gerrit came there when he was 9.

===Gerrit as a young man===

Gerrit was described as &quot;tall, magnificently built and magnificently proportioned, his large head superbly set on his shoulders;&quot; he &quot;might have served as a model for a Greek god in the days when man deified beauty and worshipped it.&quot; He attended Hamilton Oneida Academy in Clinton, Oneida County, New York, and graduated with honors from its successor Hamilton College in 1818, giving the valedictory address, and describing his stay at the college as &quot;very active with many friends&quot;. (His father was one of the trustees.) In January 1819, he married Wealtha Ann Backus (1800–1819), daughter of Hamilton College&#x27;s first President, Azel Backus D.D. (1765–1817), and sister of Frederick F. Backus (1794–1858). Wealtha died in August of the same year. In 1822, he married 16-year-old Ann Carroll Fitzhugh (1805–1879), sister of Henry Fitzhugh (1801–1866) and of Wealtha&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife. Their relationship &quot;appeared to be loving&quot;; although Ann was a religious, church-going person who worried that Gerrit was not. They had eight children, but only Elizabeth Smith Miller (1822–1911), mother of his grandson Gerrit Smith Miller, and Greene Smith (c. 1841–1880) survived to adulthood.

In the year of his graduation, the death of his mother plunged his father, Peter, into severe depression. He withdrew from all business and vested in his second son Gerrit, who had to abandon plans for a law career, the entire charge of his estate, described as &quot;monumental&quot;.

He became an active temperance campaigner, and attended temperance gatherings more than political ones. He claimed to have given in 1824 the first temperance speech ever in the New York State Legislature. In his hometown of Peterboro, he built one of the first temperance hotels in the country, which was not successful commercially, and was disliked by many locals.

Smith wrote of himself:

===Gerrit in the 1830s===
He attended numerous revival meetings, and taught Sunday school. He thought of establishing a seminary for Black students. In 1834 he began a Peterboro manual labor school for Black students, along the model of nearby Oneida Institute. It had only one instructor, and it lasted only two years. Previously a supporter of the American Colonization Society, he became an abolitionist in 1835 after a mob in Utica, including New York congressman and future Attorney General Samuel Beardsley, broke up the initial meeting of the New York Anti-Slavery Society, which he attended at the urging of his friends Beriah Green and Alvan Stewart. At his invitation, the meeting continued the next day in Peterboro. He resigned as a trustee of Hamilton College &quot;on the grounds that the school was insufficiently anti-slavery&quot;, and joined the board of and financially assisted the Oneida Institute, &quot;a hotbed of anti-slavery activity&quot;. He contributed $9,000 () to support schools in Liberia, but realized by 1835 that the American Colonization Society had no intention of abolishing slavery.

Smith was a laggard instead of a leader in changing from supporting colonization to &quot;immediatism&quot;,
immediate full abolitionism. Support for Jefferson Davis after the war would have been unthinkable for Garrison, Douglass, or other abolitionist leaders.

Gerrit&#x27;s stately house was not only an Underground Railroad stop, it received a constant stream of visitors. (See Peterboro, New York#Gerrit Smith.) His desk was said to have belonged to Napoleon. Besides a library of 1,000 volumes, on the wall was a framed map of the Eastern Seaboard, with his extensive land-holdings marked.

==Political career==
&quot;It must be admitted that few men in this country have been a candidate for high office so many times and polled so few votes.&quot;

In 1840, Smith played a leading part in the organization of the Liberty Party; the name of the party was his. In the same year, their presidential candidate James G. Birney married Elizabeth Potts Fitzhugh, Smith&#x27;s sister-in-law. Smith and Birney travelled to London that year to attend the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London.

Birney, but not Smith, is recorded in the commemorative painting of the event. In 1848, Smith was nominated for the Presidency by the remnant of this organization that had not been absorbed by the Free Soil Party. An &quot;Industrial Congress&quot; at Philadelphia also nominated him for the presidency in 1848, and the &quot;Land Reformers&quot; in 1856. In 1840 and again in 1858, he ran for Governor of New York on an anti-slavery platform.
On June 2, 1848, in Rochester, New York, Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party&#x27;s presidential candidate. At the National Liberty Convention, held June 14–15 in Buffalo, New York, Smith gave a major address, including in his speech a demand for &quot;universal suffrage in its broadest sense, females as well as males being entitled to vote.&quot; The delegates approved a passage in their address to the people of the United States addressing votes for women: &quot;Neither here, nor in any other part of the world, is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes. This universal exclusion of woman...argues, conclusively, that, not as yet, is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism, and so far practically Christian, as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family.&quot; Reverend Charles C. Foote was nominated as his running mate. The ticket would come in fourth place in the election, carrying 2,545 popular votes, all from New York.

At the request of friends, Smith had 3,000 copies printed of an 1851 speech in Troy in which he set forth his views of government. Smith laments the people&#x27;s universal dependence on government. As a consequence of that dependence, government occupies itself &quot;for the most part, in doing that it belongs to the people to do&quot;. He opposed tariffs, internal improvements, such as the Erie Canal, at public expense, and publicly-supported schools, which could not teach religion, which Smith thought the main function of schools. The remedy was less government, and the less, the better.

The only political office to which Smith was ever elected, and that by a very large majority, was Representative in the U.S. Congress. Smith served a single term in Congress, on the Free Soil ticket, from March 4, 1853, until the end of the session on August 7, 1854, although he said that because of his business activities he had sought neither the nomination nor his election. (&quot;My nomination to Congress alarmed me greatly, because I believed that it would result in my election.&quot;) He made a point of resigning his seat on the last day of the session. He then published a lengthy letter to his constituents explaining his frustrations in Congress and his decision not to run for a second term. He was well liked, even by Southern members, who found him &quot;one of the best fellows in the Capitol, as one, although well known as an abolitionist, still as one to be tolerated&quot;.

By 1856, very little of the Liberty Party remained after most of its members joined the Free Soil Party in 1848 and nearly of all what remained of the party joined the Republicans in 1854. The small remnant of the party renominated Smith under the name of the &quot;National Liberty Party&quot;.

In 1860, the remnant of the party was also called the Radical Abolitionists. A convention of one hundred delegates was held in Convention Hall, Syracuse, New York, on August 29, 1860. Delegates were in attendance from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. Several of the delegates were women. Smith, despite his poor health, fought William Goodell in regard to the nomination for the presidency. In the end, Smith was nominated for president and Samuel McFarland from Pennsylvania was nominated for vice president. The ticket won 171 popular votes from Illinois and Ohio. In Ohio, a slate of presidential electors pledged to Smith ran with the name of the Union Party.

Smith, along with his friend and ally Lysander Spooner, was a leading advocate of the United States Constitution as an antislavery document, as opposed to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who believed it was to be condemned as a pro-slavery document, and was in favor of secession by the North. In 1852, Smith was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Free-Soiler. In his address, he declared that all men have an equal right to the soil; that wars are brutal and unnecessary; that slavery could be sanctioned by no constitution, state or federal; that free trade is essential to human brotherhood; that women should have full political rights; that the Federal government and the states should prohibit the liquor traffic within their respective jurisdictions; and that government officers, so far as practicable, should be elected by direct vote of the people. Unhappy with his separation from his home and business, Smith resigned his seat at the end of the first session, ostensibly to allow voters sufficient time to select his successor.

In 1869, Smith served as a delegate to the founding convention of the Prohibition Party. During the 1872 presidential election Smith was considered for the Prohibition Party&#x27;s presidential nomination.

==Support for Black people==
According to Black Rev. Henry Highland Garnet, who moved there at Smith&#x27;s invitation, &quot;There are yet two places where slave holders cannot come—Heaven and Peterboro.&quot;

===The failed land redistribution project (Timbuctoo)===

After becoming an opponent of land monopoly, he gave numerous farms of each to 1,000 &quot;worthy&quot; New York state Blacks. In 1846, hoping to help black families become self-sufficient, to isolate and thus protect them from escaped slave-hunters, and to provide them with the property ownership that was needed for Blacks to vote in New York, Smith attempted to help free blacks settle approximately of land he owned in the remote Adirondacks. Abolitionist John Brown joined his project, purchasing land and moving his family there. However, the land Smith gave away was &quot;of but moderate fertility&quot;, &quot;heavily timbered, and in no respect remarkably inviting&quot;. In Smith&#x27;s own words, it was his &quot;poorest land&quot;; his better land he sold.

Most grantees never saw the remote land Smith had given them; many of those who did visit it soon left, and in 1857, it was estimated that less than 10% of the grantees were actually living on their land. The difficulty of farming in the mountains, coupled with the settlers&#x27; lack of experience in housebuilding and farming and the bigotry of white neighbors, caused the project to fail. As Smith put it, &quot;I was perhaps a better land-reformer in theory than in practice.&quot; The John Brown Farm State Historic Site is all that remains of the settlement, called Timbuctoo, New York.

===The Chaplin slave escape===
Peterboro became a station on the Underground Railroad. Due to his connections with it, Smith financially supported a planned mass slave escape in Washington, D.C., in April 1848, organized by William L. Chaplin, another abolitionist, as well as numerous members of the city&#x27;s large free black community. The Pearl incident attracted widespread national attention after the 77 slaves were intercepted and captured about two days after they sailed from the capital.

===The Fugitive Slave Convention===
The Fugitive Slave Convention was held in Cazenovia, New York, on August 21 and 22, 1850. It was a fugitive slave meeting, the biggest ever held in the United States. Madison County, New York, was the abolition headquarters of the country, because of philanthropist and activist Gerrit Smith, who lived in neighboring Peterboro, New York, and called the meeting &quot;in behalf of the New York State Vigilance Committee.&quot;

===Defending Fugitive Slave Law violators===
Smith paid the legal expenses of several persons charged with infractions of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.

===Helping John Brown in Kansas===
Smith became a leading figure in the Kansas Aid Movement, a campaign to raise money and show solidarity with anti-slavery immigrants to that territory. It was during this movement that he first met and financially supported John Brown.

===Harpers Ferry===
Smith was a member of what much later was called the Secret Six, a informal group of influential Northern abolitionists, who supported Brown in his efforts to capture the armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia), and start a slave revolt. After the failed raid on Harpers Ferry, Senator Jefferson Davis unsuccessfully attempted to have Smith accused, tried, and hanged along with Brown. Governor Wise suggested that Smith be brought to him, &quot;by fair or foul means&quot;, but residents of Peterboro said publicly that they would use guns to protect him.

Upset by the raid, its outcome, and its aftermath, expecting to be indicted, Smith suffered a mental breakdown; he was described in the press as &quot;a raving lunatic&quot;, who became &quot;very violent&quot;. For several weeks he was confined to the Utica Psychiatric Center, at the time called the State Lunatic Asylum. He was accused of feigning his illness, but multiple reports state that it was genuine. He was initially on a suicide watch.

When the Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; later claimed Smith had full knowledge of Brown&#x27;s plan at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Smith sued the paper for libel, claiming that he lacked any such knowledge and thought only that Brown wanted guns so that slaves who ran away to join him might defend themselves against attackers. Smith&#x27;s claim was countered by the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which produced an affidavit, signed by Brown&#x27;s son, swearing that Smith had full knowledge of all the particulars of the plan, including the plan to instigate a slave uprising. In writing later of these events, Smith said, &quot;That affair excited and shocked me, and a few weeks after I was taken to a lunatic asylum. From that day to this I have had but a hazy view of dear John Brown&#x27;s great work. Indeed, some of my impressions of it have, as others have told me, been quite erroneous and even wild.&quot; Ralph Harlow concluded his examination of the episode with this quote from Brown: &quot;G S he knew to be a timid man&quot;.

While in the New York Lunatic Asylum, now the Utica Psychiatric Center, he was treated with cannabis and morphine.

===Other social activism===
Smith was a major benefactor of New-York Central College, a co-educational and racially integrated college in Cortland County.

Smith supported the American Civil War, but at its close he advocated a mild policy toward the late Confederate states, declaring that part of the guilt of slavery lay upon the North. In 1867, Smith, together with Horace Greeley and Cornelius Vanderbilt, helped to underwrite the $100,000 (~$ in ) bond needed to free Jefferson Davis, who had, at that time, been imprisoned for nearly two years without being charged with any crime. In doing this, Smith incurred the resentment of Northern Radical Republican leaders.

Smith&#x27;s passions extended to religion as well as politics. Believing that sectarianism was sinful, he separated from the Presbyterian Church in 1843. He was one of the founders of the Church at Peterboro, a non-denominational institution open to all non-slave-owning Christians.

His private benefactions were substantial; of his gifts he kept no record, but their value is said to have exceeded $8,000,000. Though a man of great wealth, his life was one of marked simplicity. He died in 1874 while visiting relatives in New York City.

The Gerrit Smith Estate, in Peterboro, New York, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001.
== Tribute ==
Frederick Douglass dedicated to Smith &quot;My Bondage and My Freedom&quot; (1855):

Years before, a student at his Peterboro Manual Labor School, where &quot;Mr. Smith liberally supplies us with stationery, books, board and lodging&quot;, stated that &quot;if the man of color has a sincere friend, that friend is Gerrit Smith&quot;.

A visitor to Smith&#x27;s house in 1870 described it as follows:

I have visited many houses...but never before one like this. One breathing the affluence of wealth without a touch of its insolence, characterized by refinement and the highest culture, yet free from all the impertinance of display. Plainness of attire, simplicity of manner, absolute sincerity, and an all-pervading spirit of love characterize the family and give tone to the home—a home free from press and hurry and confusion, where differences of opinion are expressed without irritation, where the individual is respected, where the younger members of the family are reverent and the older ones considerate, where all are mindful of the interests of each, and each is thoughtful for all.

== Philanthropic activities ==
Money was for Smith a resource that belonged to others, a divine gift to be used for the common good. Smith provided support for a large number of progressive causes and people and, except for his land grants, did not keep careful records. The dates given are in some cases approximate, either because documents do not provide a definite date, or because there were multiple payments.
* &quot; of his land he had divided among various destitute people, and 650 poor women have received money from him to help provide themselves with homes.&quot;
* Built and ran unsuccessful temperance hotel on his property in Peterboro, 1827–1833. It reopened in 1845 but was no more successful. He also established an unsuccessful temperance hotel in Oswego.

* Support for the Oneida Institute, the first school at which both Blacks and whites were welcomed, 1830s.
* Manual labor school for &quot;colored boys&quot; in Peterboro, 1834–1836 (two years). Benjamin Quarles suggests that Smith may have ended the project because it was duplicating what was available at the nearby Oneida Institute, headed by his friend Beriah Green. Another scholar suggests that the school closed because of Smith&#x27;s disillusionment with the American Colonization Society, as the school had set upon preparing students to Christianize Africa.
* Created in Peterboro a group home to support economically destitute children.
* Founder of nondenominational Free Church of Peterboro, 1843. (Dissatisfied with existing churches&#x27; refusal to insist on abolition.)

* Sold land in North Elba to John Brown &quot;for a bargain price of $1 an acre&quot;.
* Major benefactor of New-York Central College, 1850s.
* Helped with legal expenses of Fugitive Slave Law violators, 1850s. Primary sponsor of the Fugitive Slave Convention, held in neighboring Cazenovia.
* In 1851, he funded the establishment of an educational academy in Peterboro.
* About 1855, gave $25,000 () to build the Oswego City Library, and $5,000 for books.
* Leading figure in the New England Emigrant Aid Society (Kansas Aid Movement), assisting abolitionist settlers and John Brown working to make Kansas a free state, 1850s.
* Between 1856 and 1874, donated money to &quot;interracial colleges&quot;: Berea College, Hampton Agricultural Institute, Dartmouth College, and Howard University.
* Paid for printing of James Redpath&#x27;s &quot;The Roving Editor: or, Talks with Slaves in the Southern States&quot;, 1859.
* One of Secret Six that helped finance John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry, 1859
* With Horace Greeley and Cornelius Vanderbilt, one of guarantors of Jefferson Davis&#x27;s bond, 1867.
* Supported William G. Allen and family financially during their poverty in London, 1870s and 1880s.

After his death, a newspaper reported his philanthropic activities as follows:

== Honors ==
In 2005 Smith was inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame, in Peterboro, New York.

== Writings ==
Smith paid for the printing of hundreds of broadsides, with his views on a variety of subjects. His own collection of his pamphlets is in the Syracuse University Library. A number of recipients bound those they received into volumes, different contents for each collector.

== Archival material ==
Smith&#x27;s grandson, Gerrit Smith Miller, was the final resident of the Smith mansion. In 1928, before it burned, he donated Smith&#x27;s enormous collection of letters, documents, diaries, and daybooks to the Syracuse University Library, along with a pamphlet and broadside collection of over 700 items. There is nothing like it for any other businessman of his day.
* Gerrit Smith Papers, Syracuse University Special Collections Research Center. 10,000 letters, 74 boxes. Library description of holdings: &quot;Business, family and general correspondence; business and land records; writings; and maps. Notable correspondents include Susan B. Anthony, John Jacob Astor, Henry Ward Beecher, Antoinette Blackwell, Caleb Calkins, Lydia Maria Child, Cassius Clay, Alfred Conkling, Roscoe Conkling, Charles A. Dana, Paulina W. Davis, Edward C. Delavan, Frederick Douglass, Albert G. Finney, Sarah Grimké, Elizabeth Cady and Henry B. Stanton, Louis Tappan, Sojourner Truth, and Theodore Weld.&quot; The collection has been microfilmed, and together with materials of his father Peter Smith, fills 89 reels. A partial calendar of the general correspondence was published in 1941. The Special Collections Research Center of Syracuse University also holds Smith&#x27;s pamphlet collection, &quot;700+ items&quot;, which has also been microfilmed, and over half digitized and available online.
* Another important collection of documents related to Gerrit Smith is found in the archives of his alma mater, Hamilton College, in Clinton, Oneida County, New York.
* Additional documents are in the collections of the Peterboro and the Madison County Historical Societies.

<doc id="1165404" wikidata="Q3388331" url="?curid=1165404" title="Pigskin 621 A.D.">
<text>Pigskin 621 A.D. is an arcade game released in 1990 by Midway Manufacturing under the &quot;Bally Midway&quot; label. One player can battle the computer, or two players can battle head-to-head. Two teams compete to score as many touchdowns as possible in the tradition of American football, but actual play is more similar to rugby football.

A version for the Sega Genesis, retitled &quot;Pigskin Footbrawl&quot; and endorsed by coach Jerry Glanville, was released by Razor Soft on December 18, 1992.

==Gameplay==
The player directly controls one member of a five-man team, with the object of carrying a football over the opposing team&#x27;s goal line. The playing area is littered with hazards such as pits, bushes and logs. A ball carrier who trips over any of these, or who is punched by an opponent, fumbles the ball. The field is also laden with weapons: axes, maces, nooses, scythes, spears, swords and torches. A player can pick up one of these by running over it. It will appear at the top of the screen next to the player&#x27;s score as a &quot;concealed weapon&quot;, several weapons may be carried at once and one may be carried over after a touchdown. The ball carrier can be &quot;grappled&quot;, essentially a mass tackle into which multiple characters can jump. Having a concealed weapon as well as having more characters jump into the grapple greatly increases a team&#x27;s chance of gaining or retaining possession, although weapons cannot be used if both team captains are in the grapple. A character who is injured by a concealed weapon is out of play until a touchdown is scored.

If one team gets too far behind in score in the second half of the game, a computer-controlled troll is added to the losing side to help even the odds, and behaves more aggressively than regular players. Additionally, the troll cannot be killed by weapons. Up to two trolls can be in play at a time during a standard game (one per side or two on one side). During a one player &quot;Pro Pigskin&quot; game, if the computer-controlled team continues to lose heavily even after a troll has been added or falls behind very quickly early on, an option for a &quot;Troll Bowl&quot; will appear. If selected the player will face an entire team of trolls with only human players on their own side.

Gameplay tips are given between periods and statistics are given at the end of the game. Statistics cover Goals Scored, Injuries Inflicted and Pigskin Possession Time. Before the game we can read about teams background. Both teams are renegades bands. The blue band is led by Thor Akenbak, and the red one&#x27;s captain is Atilla DeSoil.

===Scoring===
A touchdown is worth six points, with a one-point bonus for keeping possession of the ball for longer than a minimum time. (Approximately 10 seconds)

It is possible to gain very high scores by eliminating most of the opposing team and then maintaining possession of the ball for as long as possible. Since a period can only end on a change of possession, a player can keep gaining single possession points well after the period clock has run out.

===Controls===
Pigskin has two pass buttons (short and long), a punch button, and a button for selecting the team&#x27;s strategy (&quot;Block&quot;, &quot;Scatter&quot; and &quot;Bad Attitude&quot; when the player&#x27;s team is in possession of the ball; &quot;Get Ball&quot;, &quot;Man-to-Man&quot; and &quot;Bad Attitude&quot; when the opponent has it). By pressing buttons for a punch and a pass simultaneously, the player jumps at enemy.

==Sega Genesis version==
There is no scythe and torch. The music is shorter and plays at a lower volume. The game features soundbites from Atlanta Falcons coach Jerry Glanville. There is a hidden sound test.

==Offers==
At one time, the makers of &quot;Pigskin 621 A.D.&quot; offered tickets to the Super Bowl as part of a sweepstakes promotion associated with the arcade game. The game also advertised a free players handbook available by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to a specified post-office box.

==Development==
Designers Jeff Nauman and Brian Colin had previously worked on the Midway Games &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; and &quot;Rampage&quot;, which are referenced in the game&#x27;s tagline &quot;Ancient Archrivals on a Rampage&quot;.

&quot;Pigskin&quot; is the last of only seven games made for Midway&#x27;s MCR-68k system before completely switching over to newer TMS34010 based systems.

<doc id="1165405" wikidata="Q926941" url="?curid=1165405" title="Stephen C. Meyer">
<text>Stephen Charles Meyer (; born 1958) is an American historian, author, and former educator. He is an advocate of intelligent design, a pseudoscientific creationist argument for the existence of God. Meyer was a founder of the Center for Science and Culture (CSC) of the Discovery Institute (DI), which is the main organization behind the intelligent design movement. Before joining the institute, Meyer was a professor at Whitworth College. He is a senior fellow of the DI and the director of the CSC.

==Biography==
In 1981, Meyer graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Whitworth College, where he received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) with a double major in physics and earth science. He then was employed at Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) in Dallas from November 1981 to December 1985.

Meyer was granted a scholarship by the Rotary Club of Dallas to study in England at Cambridge University, where he earned a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in 1987 and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in history and the philosophy of science in 1991. His dissertation was entitled &quot;Of Clues and Causes: A Methodological Interpretation of Origin-of-Life Research&quot;.

In Fall 1990, Meyer became an assistant professor of philosophy at Whitworth College, where he was promoted to an associate professor in 1995, and granted tenure in 1996. In Fall 2002, he moved to the position of professor, Conceptual Foundations of Science, at the Christian Palm Beach Atlantic University. He continued there up to Spring 2005, then ceased teaching to devote his time to the intelligent design movement.

==Work==
===Creation science===
As an undergraduate, Meyer had been &quot;quite comfortable accepting the standard evolutionary story, although I put a bit of a theistic spin on it – that (evolution) is how God operated&quot;, but during his work with ARCO in Dallas, he was influenced by a conference: &quot;I remember being especially fascinated with the origins debate at this conference. It impressed me to see that scientists who had always accepted the standard evolutionary story were now defending a theistic belief, not on the basis that it makes them feel good or provides some form of subjective contentment, but because the scientific evidence suggests an activity of mind that is beyond nature. I was really taken with this.&quot; Charles Thaxton organised the conference held in Dallas on 9–10 February 1985, featuring Antony Flew, and Dean H. Kenyon who spoke on &quot;Going Beyond the Naturalistic Mindset: Origin of Life Studies&quot;.

Meyer became part of Thaxton&#x27;s circle, and joined the debate with two articles published in March 1986: in one, he discussed &quot;The Mystery of Life&#x27;s Origin&quot; which Thaxton had recently co-authored, commenting that the book had &quot;done well to intimate that &#x27;we are not alone.&#x27; Only revelation can now identify the Who that is with us.&quot; The other article discussed the 1981 &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; and 1985 &quot;Aguillard v. Treen&quot; district court case rulings that teaching creation science in public schools was unconstitutional as creationism originated in religious conviction, and its reliance on &quot;tenets of faith&quot; implied it was not scientific. Meyer argued that modern scientific method equally relied on &quot;foundational assumptions&quot; based on faith in naturalism, which &quot;assumed all events to be exclusively the result of physical or natural causes&quot;, so on the definition used in the court cases &quot;science itself does not qualify as legitimate science&quot;. He proposed that &quot;scientists and philosophers&quot; could turn to Biblical presupposition to explain &quot;the ultimate source of human reason, the existence of a real and uniformly ordered universe, and the ability present in a creative and ordered human intellect to know that universe. Both the Old and New Testaments define these relationships such that the presuppositional base necessary to modern science is not only explicable but also meaningful.&quot; Meyer&#x27;s argument on epistemological presuppositions and accusation that evolution is based on an assumption of naturalism became central to the design movement.

At the University of Cambridge in England, he met theology student Mark Labberton. In the Fall of 1987 Labberton introduced Meyer to Phillip E. Johnson who was on a sabbatical at University College London, and having become &quot;obsessed with evolution&quot; had begun writing a book on what he saw as its problems. Meyer says &quot;We walked around Cambridge kicking the pea gravel and talking over all the issues.&quot;

An article co-authored by Meyer and Thaxton published on 27 December 1987 asserted that &quot;human rights depend upon the Creator who made man with dignity, not upon the state.&quot; They contrasted this with &quot;purely material, scientific&quot; ideas which equated humans to animals, and restated their central thesis that &quot;Only if man is (in fact) a product of special Divine purposes can his claim to distinctive or intrinsic dignity be sustained.&quot; The terminology and concepts later featured in the Wedge strategy and theistic realism.

=== Intelligent design ===
After the 1987 &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; Supreme Court ruling affirmed the &quot;Aguillard v. Treen&quot; decision against teaching creation science, Thaxton as academic editor of &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; adopted intelligent design wording. Meyer recalls the term coming up at a June 1988 conference in Tacoma organised by Thaxton, who &quot;referred to a theory that the presence of DNA in a living cell is evidence of a designing intelligence.&quot; Phillip E. Johnson was drafting a book arguing against naturalism as the basis for evolutionary science, and Meyer brought a copy of the manuscript to the conference. He met Paul A. Nelson who found it exciting to read, and the two collaborated on a joint project. Needing a mathematician, they contacted Dembski in 1991. Thaxton has described Meyer as &quot;kind of like&quot; a Johnny Appleseed, bringing others into the movement.

Meyer became one of a group of prominent young intelligent design (ID) advocates with academic degrees: Mayer, Nelson, Dembski and Jonathan Wells. Meyer participated in the &quot;Ad Hoc Origins Committee&quot; defending Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; in 1992 or 1993 (in response to Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s review of it in the July 1992 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;), while with the Philosophy department at Whitworth College. He was later a participant in the first formal meeting devoted to ID, hosted at Southern Methodist University in 1992.

In December 1993, Bruce Chapman, president and founder of the Discovery Institute, noticed an essay in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; by Meyer about a dispute when biology lecturer Dean H. Kenyon taught intelligent design in introductory classes. Kenyon had co-authored &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, and in 1993 Meyer had contributed to the teacher&#x27;s notes for the second edition of &quot;Pandas&quot;. Meyer was an old friend of Discovery Institute co-founder George Gilder, and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to materialism. In the summer of 1995 Chapman and Meyer met a representative of Howard Ahmanson, Jr. Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson&#x27;s son in science, recalls being asked &quot;What could you do if you had some financial backing?&quot; He was a co-author of the &quot;Wedge strategy&quot;, which put forth the Discovery Institute&#x27;s manifesto for the intelligent design movement.

In 1999, Meyer with David DeWolf and Mark DeForrest laid out a legal strategy for introducing intelligent design into public schools in their book &quot;Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curriculum&quot;. Meyer has co-edited &quot;Darwinism, Design, and Public Education&quot; (Michigan State University Press, 2000) with John Angus Campbell and co-edited &quot;Science and Evidence of Design in the Universe&quot; (Ignatius Press, 2000) with Michael J. Behe and William A. Dembski. In 2009, his book &quot;Signature in the Cell&quot; was released and in December of that year.

Meyer has been described as &quot;the person who brought ID (intelligent design) to DI (Discovery Institute)&quot; by historian Edward Larson, who was a fellow at the Discovery Institute prior to it becoming the center of the intelligent design movement. In 2004, the DI helped introduce ID to the Dover Area School District, which resulted in the &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case where ID was ruled to be based on religious beliefs rather than scientific evidence. Discussing ID in relation to Dover, on May 6, 2005 Meyer debated Eugenie Scott, on &quot;The Big Story&quot; with John Gibson. During the debate, Meyer argued that intelligent design is critical of more than just evolutionary mechanisms like natural selection that lead to diversification, but of common descent itself.

=== Films and debates ===
He has appeared on television and in public forums advocating intelligent design. Notably he wrote and appeared in the Discovery Institute&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Unlocking the Mystery of Life&quot; and was interviewed in the 2008 &quot;&quot; movie. He has also been an active debater such as in April 2006 with Peter Ward, a paleontologist from the University of Washington held an open online discussion on the topic of intelligent design in the Talk of the Times forum in Seattle, WA. Meyer has also debated atheists Peter Atkins, Eugenie Scott and Michael Shermer.

=== &quot;Teach the controversy&quot; campaign ===
In March 2002 Meyer announced a &quot;teach the controversy&quot; strategy, which falsely claims that the theory of evolution is controversial within scientific circles. The presentation included submission of an annotated bibliography of 44 peer-reviewed scientific articles that he claimed raise significant challenges to key tenets of &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot;. In response to this claim, the National Center for Science Education (an organisation that works in collaboration with the National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association to support the teaching of evolution in public schools) contacted the authors of the 44 papers listed, and 26 of them, representing 34 of the papers, responded. None of the authors considered that their research challenged any of the tenets of the theory of evolution. On March 11, 2002, during a panel discussion on evolution, Meyer falsely told the Ohio Board of Education that the Santorum Amendment was part of the No Child Left Behind Act and that the State of Ohio was therefore required to require the teaching of alternative theories of evolution as part of the biology curriculum. The professor of biology Kenneth R. Miller replied that comments and not approved amendments in conference committee reports do not carry the weight of law and that Meyer had misled the board of education in implying that they do.

=== Article in the &quot;Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington&quot; ===

On 4 August 2004, an article by Meyer appeared in the peer-reviewed scientific journal, &quot;Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington&quot;. On September 7, the publisher of the journal, the Council of the Biological Society of Washington, released a statement retracting the article as not having met its scientific standards and saying that the article had been published at the discretion of the former editor Richard Sternberg &quot;without review by any associate editor&quot;. Critics believed that Sternberg&#x27;s personal and ideological connections to Meyer suggest at least the appearance of a conflict of interest in his approval of Meyer&#x27;s article.

The journal&#x27;s reasons for disavowing the article were rebutted by Sternberg, who says the paper underwent the standard peer-review process and that he was encouraged to publish it by a member of the Council of the BSW.

A critical review of the article is available on the Panda&#x27;s Thumb website. In January 2005, the Discovery Institute posted its response to the critique on their website.

The National Center for Science Education also called &quot;the Meyer paper&quot; pseudoscientific.

===Claims of persecution===
Meyer claims that those who oppose the essentially unanimous international scientific consensus on evolution are persecuted by the scientific community and prevented from publishing their views. In 2001, he signed the statement &quot;A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism&quot;, coinciding with the launch of the PBS TV series &quot;Evolution&quot;, saying in part:

The numbers of scientists who question Darwinism is a minority, but it is growing fast. This is happening in the face of fierce attempts to intimidate and suppress legitimate dissent. Young scientists are threatened with deprivation of tenure. Others have seen a consistent pattern of answering scientific arguments with ad hominem attacks. In particular, the series&#x27; attempt to stigmatize all critics – including scientists – as religious &quot;creationists&quot; is an excellent example of viewpoint discrimination.

A wide range of scholarly, science education, and legislative sources have denied, refuted, or off-handedly dismissed these allegations. In a 2006 article published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, a group of writers that included historian of science Ronald L. Numbers (author of &quot;The Creationists&quot;), philosopher of biology Elliott Sober, Wisconsin State Assembly representative Terese Berceau, and four members of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison characterized such claims as being a hoax. On their website refuting the claims in the film &quot;&quot; (which featured Meyer), the National Center for Science Education states that &quot;Intelligent design advocates ... have no research and no evidence, and have repeatedly shown themselves unwilling to formulate testable hypotheses; yet they complain about an imagined exclusion, even after having flunked the basics.&quot; In analysing an Academic Freedom bill that was based upon a Discovery Institute model statute, the Florida Senate found that &quot;According to the Department of Education, there has never been a case in Florida where a public school teacher or public school student has claimed that they have been discriminated against based on their science teaching or science course work.&quot;

=== &quot;Signature in the Cell&quot; ===

On June 23, 2009, HarperOne released Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design&quot;. The philosopher Thomas Nagel, who generally argues in opposition to the philosophical position of physicalist reductionism specifically and materialism more generally, submitted the book as his contribution to the &quot;2009 Books of the Year&quot; supplement for &quot;The Times&quot;, writing &quot;Signature in the Cell...is a detailed account of the problem of how life came into existence from lifeless matter – something that had to happen before the process of biological evolution could begin ... Meyer is a Christian, but atheists, and theists who believe God never intervenes in the natural world, will be instructed by his careful presentation of this fiendishly difficult problem.&quot;

Stephen Fletcher, chemist at Loughborough University, responded in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; that Nagel was &quot;promot[ing] the book to the rest of us using statements that are factually incorrect.&quot; Fletcher explained &quot;Natural selection is in fact a chemical process as well as a biological process, and it was operating for about half a billion years before the earliest cellular life forms appear in the fossil record.&quot; In another publication, Fletcher wrote: &quot;I am afraid that reality has overtaken Meyer&#x27;s book and its flawed reasoning&quot;, pointing out scientific problems with Meyer&#x27;s work by citing how RNA &quot;survived and evolved into our own human protein-making factory, and continues to make our fingers and toes.&quot;

Darrel Falk, former president of the BioLogos Foundation and a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University, reviewed the book, saying it illustrates why he does not support the intelligent design movement. Falk is critical of Meyer&#x27;s declaration of scientists being wrong, such as Michael Lynch about genetic drift, without Meyer having done any experiment or calculation to disprove Lynch&#x27;s assertion. Falk writes, &quot;the book is supposed to be a science book and the ID movement is purported to be primarily a scientific movementnot primarily a philosophical, religious, or even popular movement&quot;, but concludes &quot;If the object of the book is to show that the Intelligent Design movement is a scientific movement, it has not succeeded. In fact, what it has succeeded in showing is that it is a popular movement grounded primarily in the hopes and dreams of those in philosophy, in religion, and especially those in the general public.&quot;

===&quot;Darwin&#x27;s Doubt&quot;===
On 18 June 2013, HarperOne released &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design&quot;. In this book, Meyer proposed that the Cambrian explosion contradicts Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary process and is best explained by intelligent design.

In a review published by The Skeptics Society titled &quot;Stephen Meyer&#x27;s Fumbling Bumbling Amateur Cambrian Follies&quot;, paleontologist Donald Prothero gave a highly negative review of Meyer&#x27;s book. Prothero pointed out that the &quot;Cambrian Explosion&quot; concept itself has been deemed an outdated concept after recent decades of fossil discovery and he points out that &#x27;Cambrian diversification&#x27; is a more consensual term now used in paleontology to describe the 80 million-year time frame where the fossil record shows the gradual and stepwise evolution of more and more complicated animal life. Prothero criticizes Meyer for ignoring much of the fossil record and instead focusing on a later stage to give the impression that all Cambrian life forms appeared abruptly without predecessors. In contrast, Prothero cites paleontologist BS Lieberman that the rates of evolution during the &#x27;Cambrian explosion&#x27; were typical of any adaptive radiation in life&#x27;s history. He quotes another prominent paleontologist Andrew Knoll that &#x27;20 million years is a long time for organisms that produce a new generation every year or two&#x27; without the need to invoke any unknown processes. Going through a list of topics in modern evolutionary biology Meyer used to bolster his idea in the book, Prothero asserts that Meyer, not a paleontologist nor a molecular biologist, does not understand these scientific disciplines, therefore he misinterprets, distorts and confuses the data, all for the purpose of promoting the &#x27;God of the gaps&#x27; argument: &#x27;anything that is currently not easily explained by science is automatically attributed to supernatural causes&#x27;, i.e. intelligent design.

In his article &quot;Doubting &#x27;Darwin&#x27;s Doubt&#x27;&quot; published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Gareth Cook says that this book is another attempt by the creationist to rekindle the intelligent design movement. Decades of fossil discovery around the world, aided by new computational analytical techniques enable scientists to construct a more complete portrait of the tree of life which was not available to Darwin (hence his &quot;doubt&quot; in Meyer&#x27;s words). The contemporary scientific consensus is that there was no &quot;explosion&quot;. Cook cites Nick Matzke&#x27;s analysis that the major gaps identified by Meyer are derived from his lack of understanding of the field&#x27;s key statistical techniques (among other things) and his misleading rearrangement of the tree of life. Cook references scientific literature to refute Meyer&#x27;s argument that the genetic machinery of life is incapable of big leaps therefore any major biological advancement must be the result of intervention by the &#x27;intelligent designer&#x27;. Like Prothero, Cook also criticizes Meyer&#x27;s proposal that if something cannot be fully explained by today&#x27;s science, it must be the work of a supreme deity. Calling it a &#x27;masterwork of pseudoscience&#x27;, Cook warns that the influence of this book should not be underestimated. Cook opines that the book, with Meyer sewing skillfully together the trappings of science, wielding his credential of a PhD (in history of science) from the University of Cambridge, writing in a seemingly serious and reasonable manner, will appeal to a large audience who is hungry for material evidence of God or considers science a conspiracy against spirituality.

From a different perspective, paleontologist Charles Marshall wrote in his review &quot;When Prior Belief Trumps Scholarship&quot; published in Science that while trying to build the scientific case for intelligent design, Meyer allows his deep belief to steer his understanding and interpretation of the scientific data and fossil records collected for the Cambrian period. The result (this book) is selective knowledge (scholarship) that is plagued with misrepresentation, omission, and dismissal of the scientific consensus; exacerbated by Meyer&#x27;s lack of scientific knowledge and superficial understanding in the relevant fields, especially molecular phylogenetics and morphogenesis. The main argument of Meyer is the mathematically impossible time scale that is needed to support emergence of new genes which drive the explosion of new species during the Cambrian period. Marshall points out that the relatively fast appearance of new animal species in this period is not driven by new genes, but rather by evolving from existing genes through &quot;rewiring&quot; of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This basis of morphogenesis is dismissed by Meyer due to his fixation on novel genes and new protein folds as prerequisite of emergence of new species. The root of his bias is his &quot;God of the gaps&quot; approach to knowledge and the sentimental quest to &quot;provide solace to those who feel their faith undermined by secular society and by science in particular&quot;.

<text>The Ericsson T68m (often called simply T68) was a candy-bar style mobile phone by Ericsson Mobile Communications. Launched in time for the 2001 Christmas season, the T68 was the first Ericsson mobile phone to have a colour screen, a passive LCD-STN with a resolution of 101×80 and 256 colours. Despite its diminute size (3.94×1.89×0.79 in or 100×48×20 mm, 2.96 oz or 84 g), it was one of the most feature-rich mobile phones at the time, with Bluetooth, IrDA port, GPRS 3+1, tri-band compatibility (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz), SMS with T9 (predictive text), EMS, WAP, and customizable monophonic ring tones. A simple bitmap image editor was provided, allowing the creation of monochrome pictures by guiding a cursor around the canvas and setting or unsetting individual pixels (several &#x27;brush&#x27; sizes were selectable to make this easier). These images could be set as the phone&#x27;s background image in standby mode, and sent to owners of EMS-compliant phones. With EMS soon to be succeeded by the superior MMS, few owners made much use of this feature. At its release, the phone cost around € 500, GBP299 in the UK, in either two-tone grey or all-gold.

In 2002, after a slight cosmetic redesign and a software upgrade, the T68m was re-released as the Sony Ericsson T68i, as by then Ericsson had created a joint venture with Sony Corporation to produce mobile phones as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. The upgrade, also available to owners of the T68, provided a built-in e-mail client, SyncML support, and, for the first time ever, two-way MMS with full SMIL implementation. The underlying hardware remained unchanged. The T68i is known for being a highly effective example of stealth marketing: Before being released Sony Ericsson paid actors to pretend to be tourists and asked people to take pictures of them with the T68i. The previously included Tetris game was not present in the firmware of the T68i.

A camera was not present, which was sold as an add-on (MCA-25 CommuniCam) and, at the end of the model life cycle, was offered with the phone. Calendar items, wallpapers, screen savers, contact pictures and ringtones can be sent to the T68i through the Bluetooth protocol, or infrared.

The T68i was the first Ericsson (Sony) free from brominated flame retardants (BFR).

It was featured in the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

<text>Nuclear Furniture is the eighth album by American rock band Jefferson Starship, released in June 1984 through Grunt Records. It was the final album by the band before the departure of leader Paul Kantner and the eventual transition of the remaining members of the group to become Starship.

==Background==
Produced by Ron Nevison, the album was arranged with the help of Austrian producer Peter Wolf (unrelated to the J. Geils Band singer of the same name), who had previously worked with Grace Slick on her solo album &quot;Software&quot;. Wolf also contributed keyboard and synthesizer work to the album, although not an official part of the band. Wolf and his wife Ina also wrote the single &quot;No Way Out&quot;, the first of many songs penned by the duo that took the future Starship in a more commercial direction.

As the album was being recorded, Paul Kantner became frustrated with the album&#x27;s direction. Before the sessions came to a close, he stole the master tapes, put them in his car, and drove around San Francisco for a few days, and would not return them until the band mixed the album in a way more to his liking. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Kantner left the band, and he only appears in the first promotional video produced, &quot;No Way Out&quot;. After the departure of Kantner, the band lost the &quot;Jefferson&quot; moniker and became Starship; there would not be another studio album released under the Jefferson Starship name until after Kantner reformed the band in 1992.

==Reception==

&quot;Nuclear Furniture&quot; was released in 1984 and spawned the Top 40 single &quot;No Way Out&quot;, which was also the first single by any incarnation of the band to hit No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album itself reached No. 28.

Joseph McCombs of AllMusic described it as a &quot;competent but rather forgettable collection of radio-friendly dual guitar/keyboard period pop tunes.&quot; McCombs said that the juxtaposition between Kantner&#x27;s politically-oriented songs and Thomas&#x27;s more commercially-oriented songs &quot;makes for an intriguing if uneven album.&quot;

<doc id="1165416" wikidata="Q907670" url="?curid=1165416" title="Interhalogen">
<text>In chemistry, an interhalogen compound is a molecule which contains two or more different halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine) and no atoms of elements from any other group. 

Most interhalogen compounds known are binary (composed of only two distinct elements). Their formulae are generally , where &quot;n&quot; = 1, 3, 5 or 7, and X is the less electronegative of the two halogens. The value of &quot;n&quot; in interhalogens is always odd, because of the odd valence of halogens. They are all prone to hydrolysis, and ionize to give rise to polyhalogen ions. Those formed with astatine have a very short half-life due to astatine being intensely radioactive.

No interhalogen compounds containing three or more different halogens are definitely known, although a few books claim that and have been obtained, and theoretical studies seem to indicate that some compounds in the series are barely stable.

Some interhalogens, such as , , and , are good halogenating agents. is too reactive to generate fluorine. Beyond that, iodine monochloride has several applications, including helping to measure the saturation of fats and oils, and as a catalyst for some reactions. A number of interhalogens, including , are used to form polyhalides.

Similar compounds exist with various pseudohalogens, such as the halogen azides (, , , and ) and cyanogen halides (, , , and ).

==Types of interhalogens==
===Diatomic interhalogens===

The interhalogens of form XY have physical properties intermediate between those of the two parent halogens. The covalent bond between the two atoms has some ionic character, the less electronegative halogen, X, being oxidised and having a partial positive charge. All combinations of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine that have the above-mentioned general formula are known, but not all are stable. Some combinations of astatine with other halogens are not even known, and those that are known are highly unstable.

*Chlorine monofluoride (ClF) is the lightest interhalogen compound. ClF is a colorless gas with a normal boiling point of −100 °C.
*Bromine monofluoride (BrF) has not been obtained as a pure compound — it dissociates into the trifluoride and free bromine. It is created according to the following equation:
::Br2(l) + F2(g) → 2 BrF(g)
Bromine monofluoride dissociates like this:
::3 BrF → Br2 + BrF3

*Iodine monofluoride (IF) is unstable and decomposes at 0 °C, disproportionating into elemental iodine and iodine pentafluoride.
*Bromine monochloride (BrCl) is a yellow-brown gas with a boiling point of 5 °C. 
*Iodine monochloride (ICl) exists as red transparent crystals that melt at 27.2 °C to form a choking brownish liquid (similar in appearance and weight to bromine). It reacts with HCl to form the strong acid HICl2. The crystal structure of iodine monochloride consists of puckered zig-zag chains, with strong interactions between the chains. 
*Astatine monochloride (AtCl) is made either by the direct combination of gas-phase astatine with chlorine or by the sequential addition of astatine and dichromate ion to an acidic chloride solution.
*Iodine monobromide (IBr) is made by the direct combination of the elements to form a dark red crystalline solid. It melts at 42 °C and boils at 116 °C to form a partially dissociated vapour. 
*Astatine monobromide (AtBr) is made by the direct combination of astatine with either bromine vapour or an aqueous solution of iodine monobromide.
*Astatine monoiodide (AtI) is made by direct combination of astatine and iodine.

No astatine fluorides have been discovered yet. Their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds, including the reaction of an initially formed fluoride with the walls of the glass container to form a non-volatile product. Thus, although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible, it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent, as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluorides.

In addition, there exist analogous molecules involving pseudohalogens, such as the cyanogen halides.

===Tetratomic interhalogens===

*Chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) is a colourless gas that condenses to a green liquid, and freezes to a white solid. It is made by reacting chlorine with an excess of fluorine at 250 °C in a nickel tube. It reacts more violently than fluorine, often explosively. The molecule is planar and T-shaped. It is used in the manufacture of uranium hexafluoride.
*Bromine trifluoride (BrF3) is a yellow-green liquid that conducts electricity — it self-ionises to form [BrF2]+ and [BrF4]−. It reacts with many metals and metal oxides to form similar ionised entities; with other metals, it forms the metal fluoride plus free bromine and oxygen; and with water, it forms hydrofluoric acid and hydrobromic acid. It is used in organic chemistry as a fluorinating agent. It has the same molecular shape as chlorine trifluoride.
*Iodine trifluoride (IF3) is a yellow solid that decomposes above −28 °C. It can be synthesised from the elements, but care must be taken to avoid the formation of IF5. F2 attacks I2 to yield IF3 at −45 °C in CCl3F. Alternatively, at low temperatures, the fluorination reaction
::I2 + 3 XeF2 → 2 IF3 + 3 Xe
:can be used. Not much is known about iodine trifluoride as it is so unstable.
*Iodine trichloride (ICl3) forms lemon yellow crystals that melt under pressure to a brown liquid. It can be made from the elements at low temperature, or from iodine pentoxide and hydrogen chloride. It reacts with many metal chlorides to form tetrachloroiodides (), and hydrolyses in water. The molecule is a planar dimer (ICl3)2, with each iodine atom surrounded by four chlorine atoms.
*Iodine tribromide (IBr3) is a dark brown liquid.

===Hexatomic interhalogens===

All stable hexatomic and octatomic interhalogens involve a heavier halogen combined with five or seven fluorine atoms. Unlike the other halogens, fluorine atoms have high electronegativity and small size which is able to stabilize them.
*Chlorine pentafluoride (ClF5) is a colourless gas, made by reacting chlorine trifluoride with fluorine at high temperatures and high pressures. It reacts violently with water and most metals and nonmetals.
*Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) is a colourless fuming liquid, made by reacting bromine trifluoride with fluorine at 200 °C. It is physically stable, but decomposes violently on contact with water, organic substances, and most metals and nonmetals.
*Iodine pentafluoride (IF5) is a colourless liquid, made by reacting iodine pentoxide with fluorine, or iodine with silver(II) fluoride. It is highly reactive, even slowly with glass. It reacts with water to form hydrofluoric acid and with fluorine gas to form iodine heptafluoride. The molecule has the form of a tetragonal pyramid.

===Octatomic interhalogens===

*Iodine heptafluoride (IF7) is a colourless gas and a strong fluorinating agent. It is made by reacting iodine pentafluoride with fluorine gas. The molecule is a pentagonal bipyramid. This compound is the only known interhalogen compound where the larger atom is carrying seven of the smaller atoms.
*All attempts to synthesize bromine or chlorine heptafluoride have met with failure; instead, bromine pentafluoride or chlorine pentafluoride is produced, along with fluorine gas.

==Properties==
Typically, interhalogen bonds are more reactive than diatomic halogen bonds, because interhalogen bonds are weaker than diatomic halogen bonds, except for F2. If interhalogens are exposed to water, they convert to halide and oxyhalide ions. With BrF5, this reaction can be explosive. If interhalogens are exposed to silicon dioxide, or metal oxides, then silicon or metal respectively bond with one of the types of halogen, leaving free diatomic halogens and diatomic oxygen. Most interhalogens are halogen fluorides, and all but three (IBr, AtBr, and AtI) of the remainder are halogen chlorides. Chlorine and bromine can each bond to five fluorine atoms, and iodine can bond to seven. AX and AX3 interhalogens can form between two halogens whose electronegativities are relatively close to one another. When interhalogens are exposed to metals, they react to form metal halides of the constituent halogens. The oxidation power of an interhalogen increases with the number of halogens attached to the central atom of the interhalogen, as well as with the decreasing size of the central atom of the compound. Interhalogens containing fluorine are more likely to be volatile than interhalogens containing heavier halogens.

Interhalogens with one or three halogens bonded to a central atom are formed by two elements whose electronegativities are not far apart. Interhalogens with five or seven halogens bonded to a central atom are formed by two elements whose sizes are very different. The number of smaller halogens that can bond to a large central halogen is guided by the ratio of the atomic radius of the larger halogen over the atomic radius of the smaller halogen. A number of interhalogens, such as IF7, react with all metals except for those in the platinum group. IF7, unlike interhalogens in the XY5 series, does not react with the fluorides of the alkali metals.

ClF3 is the most reactive of the XY3 interhalogens. ICl3 is the least reactive. BrF3 has the highest thermal stability of the interhalogens with four atoms. ICl3 has the lowest. Chlorine trifluoride has a boiling point of −12 °C. Bromine trifluoride has a boiling point of 127 °C and is a liquid at room temperature. Iodine trichloride melts at 101 °C.

Most interhalogens are covalent gases. Some interhalogens, especially those containing bromine, are liquids, and most iodine-containing interhalogens are solids. Most of the interhalogens composed of lighter halogens are fairly colorless, but the interhalogens containing heavier halogens are deeper in color due to their higher molecular weight. In this respect, the interhalogens are similar to the halogens. The greater the difference between the electronegativities of the two halogens in an interhalogen, the higher the boiling point of the interhalogen. All interhalogens are diamagnetic. The bond length of interhalogens in the XY series increases with the size of the constituent halogens. For instance, ClF has a bond length of 1.628 Å, and IBr has a bond length of 2.47 Å.

==Production==
It is possible to produce larger interhalogens, such as ClF3, by exposing smaller interhalogens, such as ClF, to pure diatomic halogens, such as F2. This method of production is especially useful for generating halogen fluorides. At temperatures of 250 to 300 °C, this type of production method can also convert larger interhalogens into smaller ones. It is also possible to produce interhalogens by combining two pure halogens at various conditions. This method can generate any interhalogen save for IF7.

Smaller interhalogens, such as ClF, can form by direct reaction with pure halogens. For instance, F2 reacts with Cl2 at 250 °C to form two molecules of ClF. Br2 reacts with diatomic fluorine in the same way, but at 60 °C. I2 reacts with diatomic fluorine at only 35 °C. ClF and BrF can both be produced by the reaction of a larger interhalogen, such as ClF3 or BrF3 and a diatomic molecule of the element lower in the periodic table. Among the hexatomic interhalogens, IF5 has a higher boiling point (97 °C) than BrF5 (40.5 °C), although both compounds are liquids at room temperature. The interhalogen IF7 can be formed by reacting palladium iodide with fluorine.

<doc id="1165422" wikidata="Q1176298" url="?curid=1165422" title="VTM (TV channel)">
<text>VTM or Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij (English: &quot;Flemish Television Company&quot;) is the main commercial television station in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking northern region of Belgium) and forms part of a network of channels owned by DPG Media (formerly Medialaan).

It was launched on 1 February 1989 as the second commercial television channel in Belgium after the French-speaking RTL-TVI, and quickly became the most popular TV channel in the Flemish part of Belgium. Early programming consisted of local versions of game shows like &#x27;Rad Van Fortuin&#x27; (Wheel of Fortune) or &#x27;Waagstuk!&#x27; (Jeopardy!). The channel is also considered to have been instrumental in the rebirth of the local music industry as it was the first TV channel to promote local music through its primetime TV show &#x27;Tien om te zien&#x27; (Ten to see), a weekly chart show with only local music productions.

The channel&#x27;s focus on local music and local versions of international TV formats quickly allowed it to outperform public television in 1989 and the early 1990s. Average marketshare went up to over 40% in 1993. Currently VTM is still the Flemish commercial market leader and the 2nd biggest channel in Flanders. It can be received on cable, digital cable, IPTV in Flanders and Belgium and by satellite in Europe.

Parent company DPG Group also operates sister channels, including VTMKzoom (children&#x27;s), as well as VTM 2 and VTM 3. Many programs originally aired on VTM may later rerun on these other channels. The broadcaster also owns two radio stations: Q-music and JOEfm. It also formerly owned the now defunct Radio BemBem. In 2005 there were talks about MEDIALAAN, VTM&#x27;s former owner, buying the Flemish part of Canal Plus from Telenet but this fell through. In 2006 rumours spread that the RTL Group would buy 50% of MEDIALAAN, but VTM as well as RTL denied those plans.

In 2004, VTM lost its market dominance back to the public broadcaster VRT&#x27;s flagship channel één. After its big rebrand in 2008 and the latest smaller rebrand in 2012, VTM regained strength with popular shows.

The channel was rebranded along with VTM 2, VTM 3, VTM 4, VTM Non-Stop and VTM Gold, VTM Kids is yet to rebrand as VTM Fun and will have a rebrand based on Ketnet&#x27;s 2024 rebrand by Gedeon and Saffron.

==History==
On 27 October 1987, nine publishers, each with 11.1% of the shares, founded Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij (VTM), of which Jan Merckx became chairman of the board of directors. In 1988, this company was given the monopoly for the establishment of a commercial television channel in Flanders. The publishers had little or no knowledge of the medium of television and started looking for practical implementers. From the various proposals presented to them, mainly under the encouragement of Jan Merckx, they chose the proposal of Guido Depraetere, who had previously devoted an extensive study to this. He was appointed program director, with his friend Mike Verdrengh as deputy director.

The primary cause for its creation was due to changes in the media environment since the early 1980s. Up until VTM&#x27;s creation, BRT&#x27;s two channels held a television monopoly. Thanks to a 1981 demonopolisation clause improving Belgian television advertising laws and the passing of a Flemish Cable Decree in 1988, VTM was granted an 18-year license to operate.

The first broadcast took place on February 1, 1989. Already from the beginning, VTM showed an empathic success: BRT(N) TV1&#x27;s rating share, which in 1988 was of 57%, fell to 29% in 1990. In 1990 alone, VTM achieved an audience share of 36%.

VTM launched its second channel, Ka2, on 31 January 1995; the channel was later renamed several times. In 1996 VTM was facing problems due to heavy investments and the arrival of prestige programming that failed due to a decline in advertising revenue. After internal movements at the company, VTM started making profits again in 1998.

==TamTam==

For several years, VTM broadcast a kids&#x27; strand called TamTam, competing with VRT&#x27;s Ketnet. It featured programmes such as &quot;Teletubbies Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Miffy&quot; for little children and shows such as &quot;SimsalaGrimm&quot;, &quot;Tweety and Sylvester Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Schuif Af&quot; and &quot;Kids Top 20&quot; for older kids. During VTM&#x27;s latest rebrand on 29 February 2008, the channel decided to do away with the TamTam brand. The programming block is now broadcast under the VTM brand.

==VTM Kids==

VTM Kids was the kids channel of VTM. It aired between 6am and 6pm. There was also a channel called VTM Kzoom+ which aired 24/7 and was a digital only channel. The VTM Kzoom channel started on 1 October 2009 and rebranded as VTM Kids on 22 December 2018, and closed in 2023 to focus on VTM GO.

Since 15 February 2015, children&#x27;s programmes have been broadcast on VTM in the morning again, initially only on weekends, and since 3 July 2017 every day. Since 2 October 2017, the morning block is called VTM Kids.

The block will be yet to be rebranded as VTM Fun and will have a rebrand based on Ketnet&#x27;s 2024 rebrand by Gedeon and Saffron.

==Teletext==
VTM started a teletext service on 1 February 1996 which was stopped on 1 November 2014. The page 888 is still available for subtitles.

==Logos==
The first logo of the channel was an uppercase VTM wordmark accompanied by red, yellow and green stripes, in reference to the slogan &quot;VTM kleurt je dag&quot; (VTM colours your day). The basic concept was used for its first fifteen years on air with a few small modifications to the design, with the wordmark remaining intact. In 2004, VTM radically changed its identity switching to a one-colour orange look and a new wordmark. Unveiled on 29 August 2004 it was touted internally as &quot;warm, atmospheric, quick and lively&quot;. This was replaced by a lower case wordmark in 2008. The letters were now connected, under the principle of &quot;bringing people together to watch VTM&quot;.

On 20 September 2024, VTM unveiled a new wordmark, with the letters becoming separate for the first time in sixteen years. Joining the new logo is a V monogram in order to make the network&#x27;s brand more recognisable. It also coincided with a revamp of VTM Nieuws.

<text>William Robert Broughton (22 March 176214 March 1821) was a British naval officer in the late 18th century. As a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, he commanded HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; as part of the Vancouver Expedition, a voyage of exploration through the Pacific Ocean led by Captain George Vancouver in the early 1790s.

==Personal life==
William Robert Broughton was born on 22 March 1762. His father, Charles Broughton, was a Hamburg merchant and his mother, Anne Elizabeth, was the daughter of Baron William de Hertoghe. Broughton married his cousin, Jemima, on 26 November 1802. They had four children.

==Early career==
Broughton&#x27;s name was added to the muster of the yacht &quot;Catherine&quot; on 1 May 1774, as captain&#x27;s servant but Broughton first went to sea on 18 November when he joined the 14-gun sloop, &quot;Falcon&quot; which sailed for North America, under the command of Captain John Linzee.

On 14 February 1777, Broughton, by then a midshipman, transferred to &quot;Harlem&quot; under Lieutenant John Knight. He was appointed to the 64-gun &quot;Eagle&quot; on 1 July 1778, then in December he joined the seventy-four, &quot;Superb&quot; as a Master&#x27;s mate and began service in the East Indies. On 12 January 1782, Broughton was promoted to lieutenant aboard the 68-gun &quot;Burford&quot; commanded by Captain Peter Rainier. When &quot;Burford&quot; paid off on 19 July 1784, Broughton went ashore and did not serve again for almost four years.

Broughton resumed his career on 23 June 1788, aboard the 18-gun sloop, &quot;Orestes&quot;, under Manley Dixon, serving in The Channel and later, the Mediterranean. On 13 May 1790, he moved to and renewed his acquaintance with John Knight, her captain. Broughton&#x27;s first command came on 18 December when he was given command of the brig, &quot;Chatham&quot; and asked to accompany George Vancouver in his exploration of the north-west Pacific.

==Vancouver Expedition==

En route to the Pacific Northwest the expedition spent some time exploring the South Pacific and whilst sailing separately from Vancouver, in November 1791, Broughton and his crew became the first Europeans to sight both The Snares and the Chatham Islands on the 23rd and 29th respectively. The former group contains an island that still bears Broughton&#x27;s name.

Sometime after their arrival in North America, in 1792, Broughton was given the task of charting a group of islands in the Queen Charlotte Sound. In his honour, Vancouver named them the Broughton Archipelago.
In October, Broughton was ordered to explore the lower stretches of the Columbia River, between present-day Oregon and Washington. With several boats from his ship, Broughton and his party navigated upstream as far as the Columbia River Gorge and on 30 October, he reached his farthest point, landing in eastern Multnomah County east of Portland and northwest of Mount Hood, which he named for Viscount Samuel Hood, Admiral of the British Fleet. Late in 1792, Vancouver, stymied by conflicting instructions over Nootka Sound, sent Broughton back to England via Mexico and the Atlantic, bearing dispatches and requesting instructions.

==Exploring Japan and Sakhalin==
On 3 October 1793, Broughton was promoted to commander and given command of , a ship formerly commanded by Captain William Bligh.
The fitting out caused a long delay and the ship didn&#x27;t sail until February 1795 and when Broughton finally returned to north-west America, he was unable to locate Vancouver. Correctly determining that Vancouver had returned to England having completed his survey, Broughton crossed the Pacific and began a four-year survey of the Asian coast between the latitudes of 35 and 52 degrees north, which would include, the Kurile Islands, Japan, Okinawa, and Formosa.

From September 1796 Broughton charted the east coast of Honshu and Hokkaidō before wintering at Macau where he purchased a small schooner to assist the &quot;Providence.&quot; Next year he returned to Japan where the &quot;Providence&quot; was wrecked on what was to become known as Providence Reef, now Yabiji (八重干瀬), at Miyako Island. The schooner saved the crew of the wrecked ship and they continued north along the east coast of Honshu. Passing Hokkaido, the expedition sailed north into the Gulf of Tartary along the west coast of Sakhalin. Finding extensive shallows at the north end of the gulf it was falsely concluded that Sakhalin was part of the mainland (a common mistake). Broughton turned south along the coast of Korea and then headed home by way of Trincomalee, Ceylon, where the crew was paid off and he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship. Having been acquitted, he reached England in February 1799 and shortly after began to write his book, &quot;A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean; in which the coast of Asia, from the latitude of 35° north to the latitude of 52° north, the island of Insu (commonly known under the name of Jesso), the north, south and east coasts of Japan, the Lieuchieux and adjacent islands, as well as the coast of Corea, have been examined and surveyed, Performed in His Majesty&#x27;s Sloop Providence and her tender, in the years 1795, 1796, 1797, 1798&quot;. It was published in 1804.

==Later career==
Having been kept from the greater part of the French Revolutionary War by his book, Broughton resumed his active naval career on 23 June 1801, when he was given command of the 50-gun &quot;Batavier&quot; in The Channel. He served aboard her until the Peace of Amiens was ratified, in April 1802. In May, Broughton was given command of the 36-gun &quot;Penelope&quot;, serving in the North Sea, an appointment that lasted until two days before his next command, the seventy-four, &quot;Illustrious&quot;, on 30 May 1807. In her, Broughton continued service, seeing action at the Battle of the Basque Roads. After the battle, Lord Cochrane proclaimed that Admiral Gambier had not done enough to destroy the French fleet and Gambier demanded a court martial at which he was acquitted, despite Broughton speaking out against him.

In November 1810, Broughton, still in command of &quot;Illustrious&quot;, took part in the Mauritius Campaign, joining a fleet off the island of Rodriquez, under Vice-admiral Albemarle Bertie. On 29 November, this fleet landed around 10,000 troops at Grande-Baie, north-east of Port-Louis, on the Isle de France which capitulated five days later on 3 December. In 1811, Broughton took part in the Java Expedition. He was initially given command of the expedition by Admiral O&#x27;Bryen Drury the then Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies but he was relieved of his post after Drury&#x27;s death by Admiral Robert Stopford, who had arrived from the Cape. This angered Broughton, who felt that Stopford had exceeded his authority, and who applied for a court-martial, which was ultimately rejected. The mission however was a success, the British having complete control of the island by 18 September 1811.

Broughton resigned his commission on 23 October 1812 but was recalled on 31 May 1815 to serve in the channel as commander of the 100-gun &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;. In August 1815 he transferred to &quot;Spencer&quot;, a seventy-four, serving as a guardship at Plymouth. On 4 June 1815, Broughton was made a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath and promoted to Colonel of the Marines on 12 March 1819.

==Death and legacy==
Broughton died in Florence, Italy in 1821, and was buried in the Old English Cemetery, Livorno. He named many locations in the course of his explorations and has been honoured with namings as well:

* Broughton Island (New South Wales) and Providence Bay off Port Stephens, New South Wales, were surveyed by Broughton in August 1795. While there he encountered some escaped convicts whom he took back to Sydney.
* Broughton Island in the Snares Islands, New Zealand is named for Lieutenant Broughton.
* Both Broutona Island and its highest point, 801m Broutona Mount in Russia&#x27;s Kurils Islands are named for William Robert Broughton.

* Broughton Arm in Dusky Sound, New Zealand is named for Lieutenant Broughton.
* The Broughton Archipelago, Broughton Island and Broughton Strait in British Columbia&#x27;s Queen Charlotte Strait region are named for Lieutenant Broughton. A street in Vancouver&#x27;s West End and a street in Downtown Victoria also bear his name.
* Broughton&#x27;s Bluff, a popular rock climbing destination at the Lewis and Clark State Recreation Site in Troutdale, Oregon, was named after him in 1926.
* Mount Hood for Viscount Samuel Hood, Admiral of the British Fleet.
* Youngs River and Youngs Bay for his uncle, .
* Broughton&#x27;s map of the Columbia River was instrumental in the planning of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

* The pub located within the British Embassy in Seoul is named &quot;Broughton&#x27;s Club&quot; to commemorate Broughton&#x27;s exploration of Northeast Asia, including the Korean Peninsula.
* A cricket team in the Korea Cricket Association league is named &quot;Broughton&#x27;s International XI&quot; in his honour.
* Broughton Street in the West End of Vancouver, British Columbia is named in his honour.
* Broughton Avenue in Ham, Richmond upon Thames, London. Close to the hamlet of Petersham in the same borough, where the last dwelling and final resting place of Captain George Vancouver are located.

<text>Steven John Howard (born 10 May 1976) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker. Howard was usually cited as a typical target man and renowned for his aerial strength.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Howard began his career at non-league Tow Law Town, whilst working as a roofer as his day-job. He worked 12-hour shifts and also dug up roads before moving to Hartlepool United in 1995. He moved on to Northampton Town as their record signing for £120,000 in February 1999.

===Luton Town===
Luton Town signed him for £50,000 on 22 March 2001 with another £25,000 due if Luton avoided relegation, which they failed to do.

Howard was almost sacked from Luton in late 2001 after an incident during an away game against York City. The Hatters had been awarded a penalty, and Howard grabbed the ball from the designated penalty taker and promptly missed. However, an infringement was noticed and the penalty was ordered to be re-taken. Against the protests of the senior players and the management team, Howard once again grabbed the ball and stepped up to take the penalty, missing once again. He was substituted immediately afterwards and he walked straight into the changing rooms. After reclaiming his place in the team, Howard went on to score 24 goals as Luton finished runners-up in the Division 3 and Howard won the Golden Boot for that Division.

The 2002–03 season saw Howard partnered by Tony Thorpe. Many pundits expected Thorpe to be the striker to hit 20+ goals that season, but it was Howard who again finished as the Hatters&#x27; top scorer, this time with 23. Howard was part of the squad of players that dug deep and stuck together as the awful mess of the 2003 take-over saga unravelled. During that season, Howard suffered from a hernia and missed a large chunk of the season, but again he finished as the Hatters&#x27; top scorer, this time with 16 goals.

In the summer of 2004 a transfer to Sheffield Wednesday for £500,000 appeared to be imminent after Wednesday announced that Luton had accepted a bid for him. Luton then came out and denied accepting a bid. After much confusion, Howard stayed at Luton and earned himself a League One winner&#x27;s medal. With 18 goals, Howard played a crucial part in Luton&#x27;s promotion season, earning himself a place in the League One PFA Team of the Year alongside five of his Luton teammates.

Howard signed a new deal in June 2005, despite interest from a host of clubs in Luton&#x27;s new league. In his first season at Championship level, he managed to hit 15 goals in 45 appearances. This is more impressive because Howard played a large chunk of the season at centre-half following an injury crises. Howard scored more than 100 goals for Luton and is the third all time scorer. He wore the number 19 shirt at Luton, and Howard is regarded by Luton fans as a club legend, with over 100 goals in all competitions (96 in the league), five years of service, two promotions and a never-say-die attitude.

Howard&#x27;s form attracted &quot;derisory offers&quot; from Leeds United, Cardiff City and Norwich City. On 22 July 2006, he signed a three-year contract with Derby County for £1 million. Then-manager of Luton Mike Newell said the club had no choice but to let Howard leave the club.

===Derby County===

Howard made his Derby County debut in a 2–2 draw with Southampton on the opening day of the 2006–07 season. His £1 million fee made him Derby&#x27;s biggest signing for over 5 years and he initially struggled to repay it as he failed to score in his first seven appearances for the club. He finally broke his duck with the winner in a 1–0 victory against Wolves at Molineux and went on to score in four consecutive games, the first player to do so for the club since Fabrizio Ravanelli in 2001.

Howard quickly became a fans&#x27; favourite as his work rate and goals helped Derby to finish third in the 2006–07 Championship and eventually earn promotion to the Premier League for the first time in 5 years following a 1–0 win over West Bromwich Albion in the play-off final. He finished the season as Derby&#x27;s top scorer with 19 goals, of which 16 came in the league and 3 in Cup competitions, two of which were vital goals in the Championship play-off semi-final first leg against Southampton at the St. Mary&#x27;s Stadium, giving Derby a 2–1 lead prior to the second leg at Pride Park. Howard was also nominated for the January 2007 Championship player of the month award and was awarded the Jack Stamps Trophy as Derby&#x27;s Player of the Season for 2006–07.

Howard, and Derby as a team, found life in the Premier League difficult and he managed only one goal in a 4–1 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 8 December 2007. He also missed a vital penalty in a 2–1 home defeat to Blackburn Rovers on 30 December 2007. It proved to be his last contribution for Derby County, and the club confirmed there was interest shown in Howard from other clubs in December.

===Leicester City===
Howard joined Leicester City on 1 January 2008 for a fee of £1.5 million, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. Initially signing on loan, Derby teammate Matt Oakley joined him at the club on 11 January. He made his debut in a 3–1 defeat to QPR on 1 January 2008. He scored his first goal in an M69 derby on 12 January, in which Leicester won 2–0. Howard bagged a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over West Brom on 15 March, a result he said was coming and was confident the club could stay up. Despite regaining his form by scoring six goals however, Howard could not prevent Leicester from being relegated at the end of the season.

Desperate to win promotion back to the Championship, Howard was able to maintain his form the following season. Partnering teammate Matty Fryatt in attack, he scored 13 league goals and contributed numerous assists to help Leicester maintain their lead at the top of League One. He went on to help the club secure their promotion as champions, earning his second League One medal on 24 April. Howard was also voted Leicester City supporters club player of the season for the 2008–09 season. His overall performance earned him the club&#x27;s player of the season award on 28 April 2009.

In April 2009, Howard believed Leicester could win promotion to the Premier League in the 2009–10 season. He failed to score his first goal until 12 December 2009, in a 3–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Howard scored a total of 5 league goals in 35 matches as Leicester qualified for the Championship play-offs. Despite eventually going on to lose to Cardiff City 4–3 on penalties in the play-off semi-final, Howard&#x27;s performance in the second leg earned him great plaudits, being described in both The Times and The Scotsman as &quot;unplayable&quot;.

Howard extended his contract with the club until June 2012 on 21 October 2010. He scored 4 league goals and played 35 games in the 2010–11 season, of which 19 were as a substitute. He was linked with a permanent move to Sheffield Wednesday in April 2011, but Leicester denied that they were selling him. In the 2011–12 season, Howard&#x27;s position in the first team was limited as a result of Leicester buying new strikers. He made his 55th appearance off the bench in a 2–0 win over Coventry City on 3 March 2012. This made him the most-used substitute in the club&#x27;s history, beating the previous record of 54 held by Trevor Benjamin.

===Hartlepool United return===
On 11 July 2012, Howard re-joined Hartlepool United as a free agent following his release from Leicester City His first goal back at the club came in a 2–1 defeat at home to Sheffield United on 2 October 2012. However, his first season back was not successful and Steve was booed off in his last game before being loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday while Hartlepool were relegated to League Two.

Howard&#x27;s first game back from his loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday was in a pre-season friendly for Pools against Middlesbrough F.C. in which his substitution was greeted to boos due to comments he had made about the club in the press and on Twitter. Boss Colin Cooper stated that &quot;He wants to repay the fans and although he knows that won&#x27;t be easy, it&#x27;s something he&#x27;s determined to do&quot; as he was handed the number nine shirt for the 2013–14 season.

Howard&#x27;s contract was terminated by mutual agreement on 25 November after only managing 3 goals in a season and a half. His last game for Hartlepool saw him sent off after only being on the field for five minutes in a 3–1 home defeat to Oxford United.

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
Howard was signed on loan on 28 March 2013 and was one of 3 emergency loan signings made by manager Dave Jones. Howard was brought in alongside Stuart Holden and Seyi Olofinjana. Some owls fans were speculative about the loan signing of the 36-year-old, who was brought in from – at the time – bottom of the League One Table, Hartlepool United who were on the verge of relegation. Howard made his first appearance for the Owls against Bristol City at Ashton Gate on 1 April 2013 in a 1–1 draw. During the game Howard flicked on a header to set Jermaine Johnson up for his fourth of the season. Howard only played 63 minutes before being substituted by striker, Gary Madine. Howard made his second appearance for the owls as substitute, in the 69th minute and replaced striker Leroy Lita. Howard started his third game for the Owls, partnered alongside Lita and was denied a first Wednesday goal from a close range shot saved by Millwall keeper David Forde, in a vital 1–2 victory over Millwall. Howard&#x27;s first goal for the Owls came in the last game of the season from a Miguel Llera pass, Howard struck a top left finish in the 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough, to clinch safety from the hands of relegation.

==International career==
Along with James Morrison and Gabriel Agbonlahor, Howard was one of a number of English-born players identified in June 2007 as being eligible to play for Scotland. In November 2007, he was named in the Scotland B squad for a match against Republic of Ireland B, scoring on his debut in a 1–1 draw.

==Personal life==
Howard is a fan of Newcastle United and fulfilled a lifelong ambition of playing at St James&#x27; Park when he played in the Derby side which drew 2–2 on 23 December 2007.

<doc id="1165426" wikidata="Q17080189" url="?curid=1165426" title="Mono Lake Committee">
<text>The Mono Lake Committee (MLC) is an environmental organization based in Lee Vining, California in the United States. Its mission is to preserve Mono Lake, by reducing diversions of water from the Eastern Sierra watersheds by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP).

==Mono Lake==

Mono Lake is an alkaline lake east of Yosemite National Park, largely fed by streams from the Sierra Nevada; it has no natural outlet. In 1919 the level of the lake peaked at 6427&#x27; above sea level. Birds bred and nested on a few volcanic islands in the lake, sustained by the extensive brine shrimp and alkali flies, which also attracted large numbers of migratory birds.

In 1941, the LADWP began redirecting water from the streams feeding Mono Lake into the Los Angeles Aqueduct. As time passed, this both reduced the level of the lake and dried out the lower sections of the source streams. By 1981 the level of the lake had been reduced to 6372&#x27; above sea level, with the lake&#x27;s volume cut in half, and its salinity doubled. Negit Island, a breeding site for birds, developed a land bridge and became susceptible to land-based predators such as coyotes.

==Formation of the Mono Lake Committee==
In 1975, David Winkler, Jefferson Burch, and Christine Weigen obtained a grant from the NSF, with help and encouragement from ecologist David Gaines, to study the ecology of Mono Lake. Gaines had found that, starting in 1941, LADWP&#x27;s diversions of water from Mono Lake&#x27;s inflow creeks had caused it to lose half its volume and double its salinity. These changes, Gaines reported, reduced the ability of the lake to support its saline ecosystem. During 1976–1977, Gaines witnessed the lake&#x27;s water level drop even further, and he determined to take action.

The committee was founded in March 1978 by Gaines, David Winkler, Sally Judy and Mark Ross. Gray Brechin soon became the committee&#x27;s first director; he joined Gaines and others in lobbying California politicians

Mono Lake is an important habitat for migratory birds (including the California gull). The lowering of the water level endangered the bird nesting grounds on Negit Island in the middle of the lake: a land bridge had formed, which allowed predators to attack the bird nests.

==LADWP Lawsuit==
In 1979, the MLC, along with the Audubon Society filed suit in Mono County, California Superior Court, claiming that LADWP&#x27;s water diversions violated the public trust doctrine: that all navigable water must be managed for the benefit of everyone. In 1983, MLC won the argument in front of the California Supreme Court, who directed that the public trust doctrine overrides prior water rights.

Bruce Dodge, of Morrison and Foerster, served as the pro-bono attorney in the case.

Eventually, multiple litigations were adjudicated in 1994, by the California State Water Resources Control Board. In that ruling, LADWP was required to let enough water into Mono Lake to raise the lake level above the then-current level of below the 1941 level. As of 2018, the water level in Mono Lake has risen of the required . Los Angeles made up for the lost water through state-funded conservation and recycling projects.

==Current Status and Activities==

The Mono Lake Committee currently monitors the status of the lake and the compliance of the LADWP with the court decision, supports scientific research in the Mono Lake region, and is actively working on restoring the incoming stream environments. They also provide extensive educational activities to schools and the general public, and maintain an office, information center, and bookstore in Lee Vining, CA that also serves as the Lee Vining Chamber of Commerce.

<text>The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is an independent agency in the executive branch of the United States government created in 1935 to administer a social insurance program providing retirement benefits to the country&#x27;s railroad workers.

The RRB serves U.S. railroad workers and their families, and administers retirement, survivor, unemployment, and sickness benefits. Consequently, railroad workers do not participate in the United States Social Security program. The RRB&#x27;s headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois, with field offices throughout the country.

In connection with the retirement program, the RRB has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit payments and railroad workers&#x27; Medicare coverage.

During fiscal year 2009, retirement survivor benefits of some $10.5 billion were paid to about 589,000 beneficiaries, while net unemployment-sickness benefits of $160 million, including over $10 million in temporary extended unemployment benefits under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, were paid to more than 40,000 claimants.

At the end of fiscal year 2018, the average annuity paid to career rail employees was $3,525 per month, the average annuity paid for all retired rail employees was $2,815 per month, and the average retirement benefit under Social Security was $1,415 per month.

Railroad retirement benefit payments are financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by railroad employers and their employees. Since 2002, funds not needed immediately for benefit payments or administrative expenses have been invested by an independent National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust, which qualifies as non profit 501(c)(28). As of September 30, 2009, Trust-managed assets and RRB assets held in reserve totaled almost $25 billion.

==History==

The assignment, furlough, and recall of most railroad employees was based on seniority. When work became scarce, employees with the least seniority were the first to be laid-off. The majority of railroaders were covered by pension plans, but private pension payments could be reduced if revenues were down, and many had been cut drastically by 1934.

This practice created a conflict between older employees, who preferred the certainty of a paycheck to an unreliable pension, and younger employees, who saw opportunity for increased job security if superannuated workers could be induced to retire by guaranteeing them a decent pension.

Railroad workers formed an association to agitate for government action. The Department of Labor proposed its own plan in response, eventually compromising with the workers to produce the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934. This legislation anticipated the Social Security Act of 1935, which covered most other employees, and was tailored to address the specific concerns of railroad workers.

The Act was soon found unconstitutional, but President Roosevelt intervened to push for a lasting compromise. This pressure resulted in the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935, which set up a staff retirement plan providing annuities based on an employee&#x27;s creditable railroad earnings and service, and Railroad Retirement and Carrier Taxing Acts of 1937, which made railroad employees the only private-sector workers outside the Social Security system to have a separate, federally administered pension plan. More than 95,000 elderly and disabled railroad employees applied for pension benefits by the end of 1937.

Since passage of the Railroad Retirement Acts of the 1930s, numerous other railroad laws have subsequently been enacted.

While the railroad retirement system has remained separate from the social security system, the two systems are closely coordinated with regard to earnings credits, benefit payments, and taxes. The financing of the two systems is linked through a financial interchange under which, in effect, the portion of railroad retirement annuities that is equivalent to social security benefits is coordinated with the social security system. The purpose of this financial coordination is to place the social security trust funds in the same position they would be in if railroad service were covered by the social security program instead of the railroad retirement program.

Legislation enacted in 1974 restructured railroad retirement benefits into two tiers, so as to coordinate them more fully with social security benefits. The first tier is based on combined railroad retirement and social security credits, using social security benefit formulas. The second tier is based on railroad service only and is comparable to the pensions paid over and above social security benefits in other industries.

The railroad unemployment insurance system was also established in the 1930s. The Great Depression demonstrated the need for unemployment compensation programs, and state unemployment programs had been established under the Social Security Act in 1935. While the state unemployment programs generally covered railroad workers, railroad operations which crossed state lines caused special problems. Unemployed railroad workers were denied compensation by one state because their employers had paid unemployment taxes in another state. Although there were cases where employees appeared to be covered in more than one state, they often did not qualify in any.

A federal study commission, which reported on the nationwide state plans for unemployment insurance, recommended that railroad workers be covered by a separate plan because of the complications their coverage had caused the state plans. Congress subsequently enacted the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act in June 1938. The Act established a system of benefits for unemployed railroaders, financed entirely by railroad employers and administered by the RRB. Sickness benefits were added in 1946.

The agency offices were originally located in Washington, DC. They relocated to Chicago, IL, as part of a decentralization of government offices after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II.

==Railroad Retirement Act==
Under the Railroad Retirement Act, retirement and disability annuities are paid to railroad workers with at least 10 years of service. Such annuities are also payable to workers with 5 years of service if performed after 1995.

===Provisions===

Full age annuities are payable at age 60 to workers with 30 years of service. For those with less than 30 years of service, reduced annuities are payable at age 62 and unreduced annuities are payable at full retirement age, which is gradually rising from 65 to 67, depending on the year of birth. Disability annuities can be paid on the basis of total or occupational disability. Annuities are also payable to spouses and divorced spouses of retired workers and to widow(er)s, surviving divorced spouses, remarried widow(er)s, children, and parents of deceased railroad workers. Qualified railroad retirement beneficiaries are covered by Medicare in the same way as social security beneficiaries.

As noted, the RRB pays retirement annuities to employees, as well as their spouses and/or divorced spouses, if the employee had at least 10 years of railroad service, or 5 years if performed after 1995. However, for survivor benefits, there is an additional requirement that the employee&#x27;s last regular employment before retirement or death was in the railroad industry. If a railroad employee or his or her survivors do not qualify for railroad retirement benefits, the RRB transfers the employee&#x27;s railroad retirement credits to the Social Security Administration, where they are treated as social security credits.

===Financing===

Payroll taxes paid by railroad employers and their employees are the primary source of funding for the railroad retirement-survivor benefit programs. Railroad retirement taxes, which have historically been higher than social security taxes, are calculated, like benefit payments, on a two-tier basis. Railroad retirement tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay tier I taxes at the same rate as social security taxes. In addition, both employees and employers pay tier II taxes which are used to finance railroad retirement benefit payments over and above social security levels. These tier II taxes are based on the ratio of certain asset balances to the sum of benefit payments and administrative expenses.

Revenues in excess of benefit payments are invested to provide additional trust fund income. The National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust manages and invests railroad retirement assets. Railroad retirement funds are invested in non-governmental assets, as well as in governmental securities.

Additional trust fund income is derived from the financial interchange with the social security trust funds, revenues from federal income taxes on railroad retirement benefits, and appropriations from general treasury revenues provided after 1974 as part of a phase-out of certain vested dual benefits.

==Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act==
Under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, unemployment insurance benefits are paid to railroad workers who are unemployed but ready, willing, and able to work and sickness benefits to railroad workers who are unable to work because of illness or injury. The RRB also operates a placement service to assist unemployed railroaders in securing employment.

===Benefit Year===

A new unemployment-sickness benefit year begins every July 1, with eligibility generally based on railroad service and earnings in the preceding calendar year. Up to 26 weeks of normal unemployment or sickness benefits are payable to an individual in a benefit year. Additional extended benefits are payable to persons with 10 or more years of service.

===Financing===

The railroad unemployment-sickness benefit program is financed by taxes on railroad employers under an experience-rating system. Each employer&#x27;s payroll tax rate is determined annually by the RRB on the basis of benefit payments to the railroad&#x27;s employees.

==Organization and functions==
The Railroad Retirement Board is headed by three members appointed by the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate. One member is appointed upon the recommendation of railroad employers, one is appointed upon the recommendation of railroad labor organizations and the third, who is the chairman, is appointed to represent the public interest. The board members&#x27; terms of office are five years and are scheduled to expire in different years. However, they may continue to serve after the expiration of their term, until their successor takes office. A majority of the members in office constitutes a quorum.

The primary function of the RRB is the determination and payment of benefits under the retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness programs. To this end, the RRB employs field representatives to assist railroad personnel and their families in filing claims for benefits, examiners to adjudicate the claims, and information technology staff, equipment and programs to maintain earnings records, calculate benefits and process payments.

The RRB also employs actuaries to predict the future income and outlays of the railroad retirement system, statisticians and economists to provide vital data, and attorneys to interpret legislation and represent the RRB in litigation. The President also appoints an Inspector General for the RRB, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Inspector General employs auditors and investigators to detect any waste, fraud, or abuse in the benefit programs.

==Long Island Rail Road disability controversy==
In contrast to the single disability program offered by Social Security, Railroad Retirement offers two types of disability annuities. The Total Disability, or &quot;Disability Freeze&quot;, is based on guidelines similar to Social Security Disability. The Occupational Disability only requires that applicants possess certain ailments which are deemed by law as an inability for them to safely perform their particular regular job.

Railroad employees applying for either disability annuity must end any compensated service within 90 days from the date of filing. Employees either quit their jobs, retire or exhaust sick benefits before applying for either disability. Because of this requirement and the work restrictions while receiving a disability annuity, most annuitants had worked for carriers that already awarded them private company pensions.

In 2008, more than 90 percent of Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) retirees were receiving occupational disability payments. A former LIRR pension department manager was arrested and charged with official misconduct for allegedly &quot;taking money to help railroad employees find a doctor and fill out paperwork for federal disability payments&quot;. All charges of corruption and official misconduct were dismissed by Supreme Court Judge Kase on December 11, 2009, who stated the prosecution had misled the Grand Jury in the indictment. In October of that year, the Board voted to strengthen its oversight of disability pensions.

A report produced in September 2009 by the U. S. Government Accountability Office disclosed that five federal agencies which investigated and audited the disability awards found no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing by either the Railroad Retirement Board or the retirees who applied for those awards. Its investigation did state, however, that &quot;a nearly 100-percent approval rate in a federal disability program is troubling, and could indicate lax internal controls in the Board&#x27;s decision-making process, weaknesses in program design, or both.&quot; The report found no fraud or wrongdoing, but noted that in &quot;prior work, we found that numerous claims with evidence from the same doctors can be an indicator of potential fraud or abuse&quot;; unlike sister agency Metro-North Railroad, LIRR disability evidence was provided primarily by one of three doctors.

In March 2010, the New York Attorney General&#x27;s Office announced that LIRR had agreed to appoint an independent examiner and implement other reforms to address abuses of the occupational disability benefits by its retirees and to help ensure that benefits are available only to those who truly are disabled.

Another additional 11 federal arrests occurred on October 27, 2011, including two doctors and a former union official. In September 2012, four LIRR retirees pleaded guilty to fraud. In February 2014, physician Peter J. Lesniewski was charged for providing &quot;fraudulent medical narratives in support of the disability applications of at least 230 LIRR employees.&quot;

<doc id="1165436" wikidata="Q430891" url="?curid=1165436" title="Y Gododdin">
<text>Y Gododdin () is a medieval Welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to the men of the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and its allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at a place named &quot;Catraeth&quot; in about AD 600. It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin and survives only in one manuscript, the &quot;Book of Aneirin&quot;.

The Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century, but &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; has been dated to between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; (&quot;Old North&quot;); as such it would have originated in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic. Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th, or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry.

The Gododdin, known in Roman times as the Votadini, held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and Northumberland, part of the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot;. The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.

The manuscript contains several stanzas which have no connection with the Gododdin and are considered to be interpolations. One stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions a hero called Arthur in passing, which, if not an interpolation, might be the earliest known reference to King Arthur.

==Book of Aneirin==

===Manuscript===
Only one early manuscript of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; is known, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from the second half of the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as &quot;Gorchanau&quot;. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A, while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.

Differences exist within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material show signs of partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder shows much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, but after a while tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas as they were in the older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Book of Aneirin is from three sources.

===Poem===
The stanzas that make up the poem are a series of elegies for warriors who fell in battle against vastly superior numbers. Some of the verses refer to the entire host, and others eulogize individual heroes. They tell how the ruler of the Gododdin, Mynyddog Mwynfawr, gathered warriors from several Brittonic kingdoms and provided them with a year&#x27;s feasting and drinking mead in his halls at Din Eidyn, before launching a campaign in which almost all of them were killed fighting against overwhelming odds. The poetry is based on a fixed number of syllables, though some irregularity occurs, which may be due to modernisation of the language during oral transmission. It uses rhyme, both end-rhyme and internal, and some parts use alliteration. A number of stanzas may open with the same words, for example &quot;Gwyr a aeth gatraeth gan wawr&quot; (&quot;Men went to Catraeth at dawn&quot;).

The collection appears to have been compiled from two different versions: according to some verses, there were 300 men of the Gododdin, and only one, Cynon ap Clydno, survived; others have 363 warriors and three survivors, in addition to the poet, who as a bard, almost certainly would not have been counted as one of the warriors. The names of about 80 warriors are given in the poem.

The Book of Aneirin begins with the introduction &quot;&quot; (&quot;This is the Gododdin; Aneirin sang it&quot;). A stanza, a version of which is found in both texts, but which forms the beginning of the B text, appears to be a reciter&#x27;s prologue:
Text A begins with an awdl in praise of an individual hero:
Other stanzas praise the entire host, for example number 13:
Mead is mentioned in many stanzas, sometimes with the suggestion that it is linked to their deaths. This led some 19th-century editors to assume that the warriors went into battle drunk, however Williams explained that &quot;mead&quot; here stood for everything the warriors received from their lord. In return, they were expected to &quot;pay their mead&quot; by being loyal to their lord unto death. A similar concept is found in Anglo-Saxon poetry. The heroes commemorated in the poem are mounted warriors; there are many references to horses in the poem. There are references to spears, swords and shields, and to the use of armour (&quot;llurug&quot;, from the Latin &quot;lorica&quot;). There are several references which indicate that they were Christians, for example &quot;penance&quot; and &quot;altar&quot;, while the enemy are described as &quot;heathens&quot;. Several of these features can be seen in stanza 33:
However, D. Simon Evans has suggested that most, if not all, of the references which point to Christianity may be later additions.

Many personal names are given, but only two are recorded in other sources. One of the warriors was Cynon ap Clydno, whom Williams identifies with the Cynon ap Clydno Eiddin who is mentioned in old pedigrees. The other personal name recorded in other sources is Arthur. If the mention of Arthur formed part of the original poem this could be the earliest reference to Arthur, as a paragon of bravery. In stanza 99, the poet praises one of the warriors, Gwawrddur:
Many of the warriors were not from the lands of the Gododdin. Among the places mentioned are Aeron, thought to be the area around the River Ayr and &quot;Elfed&quot;, the area around Leeds still called Elmet. Others came from further afield, for example one came from &quot;beyond Bannog&quot;, a reference to the mountains between Stirling (thought to have been &quot;Manaw Gododdin&quot; territory) and Dumbarton (chief fort of the Brittonic Kingdom of Strathclyde) – this warrior must have come from Pictland. Others came from Gwynedd in north Wales.

===Interpolations===

Three of the stanzas included in the manuscript have no connection with the subject matter of the remainder except that they are also associated with southern Scotland or northern England rather than Wales. One of these is a stanza which celebrates the victory of the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde under Eugein I, here described as &quot;the grandson of Neithon&quot;, over Domnall Brecc (&quot;Dyfnwal Frych&quot; in Welsh), king of Dál Riata, at the Battle of Strathcarron in 642:
Another stanza appears to be part of the separate cycle of poems associated with Llywarch Hen. The third interpolation is a poem entitled &quot;Dinogad&#x27;s Smock&quot;, a cradle-song addressed to a baby named Dinogad, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing. The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down, these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript, then being incorporated in the poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong. The Strathcarron stanza, for example, is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin, and Kenneth H. Jackson has suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at the top of the first page of the original manuscript. According to John T. Koch&#x27;s reconstruction, this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde.

==Analysis and interpretation==

===Date===
The date of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; has been the subject of debate among scholars since the early 19th century. If the poem was composed soon after the battle, it must predate 638, when the fall of Din Eidyn was recorded in the reign of Oswy king of Bernicia, an event which is thought to have meant the collapse of the kingdom of the Gododdin. If it is a later composition, the latest date which could be ascribed to it is determined by the orthography of the second part of Scribe B&#x27;s text. This is usually considered to be that of the 9th or 10th centuries, although some scholars consider that it could be from the 11th century.

Most of the debate about the date of the poem has employed linguistic arguments, mostly concerning rhyme (since more is known about early Welsh phonology than other aspects of the language, like syntax). It is believed that around the time of the battle, the British language was transitioning into its daughter languages: the primitive form of Welsh in Wales, of Cornish and Breton in southwestern Britain and Brittany, and Cumbric in northern Britain. Kenneth H. Jackson concluded that the majority of the changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the 5th to the end of the 6th century. This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables. If the poem dates to this time, it would have originated in an early form of Cumbric, the usual name for the Brittonic speech of the Hen Ogledd. Jackson suggested the name &quot;Primitive Cumbric&quot; for the dialect spoken at the time.

Sweetser gives the example of the name &quot;Cynfelyn&quot; found in &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;; in British this would have been &quot;Cunobelinos&quot;. The middle unstressed &quot;o&quot; and the final unstressed &quot;os&quot; have been lost. Ifor Williams, whose 1938 text laid the foundations for modern scholarly study of the poetry, considered that part of it could be regarded as being of likely late 6th-century origin. This would have been orally transmitted for a period before being written down. Dillon cast doubt on the date of composition, arguing that it is unlikely that by the end of the 6th century Primitive Welsh would have developed into a language &quot;not notably earlier than that of the ninth century&quot;. He suggests that the poetry may have been composed in the 9th century on traditional themes and attributed to Aneirin. Jackson however considers that there is &quot;no real substance&quot; in these arguments, and points out that the poetry would have been transmitted orally for a long period before being written down, and would have been modernised by reciters, and that there is in any case nothing in the language used which would rule out a date around 600. Koch suggests a rather earlier date, about 570, and also suggests that the poem may have existed in written form by the 7th century, much earlier than usually thought. Koch, reviewing the arguments about the date of the poetry in 1997, states:
Koch himself believes that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century. Greene in 1971 considered that the language of the poem was 9th-century rather than 6th-century, and Isaac, writing in 1999, stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century.

The other approach to dating the poetry has been to look at it from a historical point of view. Charles-Edwards writing in 1978 concluded that:
Dumville, commenting on these attempts to establish the historicity of the poem in 1988, said, &quot;The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; but that does not mean that it cannot be.&quot; Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, &#x27;evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later&#x27;. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later &quot;forgeries&quot; have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, &quot;it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten&quot;.

===Background===

The poem is set in the area which is now southern Scotland and north-east England. Around the year 600 this area included a number of Brittonic kingdoms. Apart from the Gododdin, the kingdom of Alt Clut occupied the Strathclyde area and Rheged covered parts of Galloway, Lancashire and Cumbria. Further south lay the kingdom of Elmet in the Leeds area. These areas made up what was later known in Welsh as &quot;Yr Hen Ogledd&quot; (The Old North). The Gododdin, known as the Votadini in the Romano-British period, occupied a territory from the area around the head of the Firth of Forth as far south as the River Wear. In modern terms their lands included much of Clackmannanshire and the Lothian and Borders regions. Their capital at this period may have been called &quot;Din Eidyn&quot;, now known as Edinburgh. By this time the area that later became Northumbria had been invaded and increasingly occupied by the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia.

In the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, attributed to Nennius, there is a reference to several poets in this area during the 6th century. Having mentioned Ida of Bernicia, the founder of the Northumbrian royal line who ruled between 547 and 559, the Historia goes on to say:
Nothing has been preserved of the work of Talhaearn, Blwchfardd and Cian, but poems attributed to Taliesin were published by Ifor Williams in &quot;Canu Taliesin&quot; and were considered by him to be comparable in antiquity to the Gododdin. This poetry praises Urien of Rheged and his son Owain, and refers to Urien as lord of Catraeth.

===Interpretation===
&quot;Y Gododdin&quot; is not a narrative poem but rather a series of elegies for heroes who died in a battle whose history would have been familiar to the original listeners. The context of the poem has to be worked out from the text itself. There have been various interpretations of the events recorded in the poem. The 19th-century Welsh scholar Thomas Stephens identified &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; with the Votadini and &quot;Catraeth&quot; as Catterick in North Yorkshire. He linked the poem to the Battle of Degsastan in 603 between King Æthelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under Áedán mac Gabráin, king of Dál Riada. Gwenogvryn Evans in his 1922 edition and translation of the Book of Aneirin claimed that the poem referred to a battle around the Menai Strait in 1098, emending the text to fit the theory. The generally accepted interpretation for the Battle of Catraeth is that put forward by Ifor Williams in his &quot;Canu Aneirin&quot; first published in 1938. Williams interpreted &quot;mynydawc mwynvawr&quot; in the text to refer to a person, Mynyddog Mwynfawr in modern Welsh. Mynyddog, in his version, was the king of the Gododdin, with his chief seat at Din Eidyn (modern Edinburgh). Around the year 600 Mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors, some from as far afield as Gwynedd. He feasted them at Din Eidyn for a year, then launched an attack on &quot;Catraeth&quot;, which Williams agrees with Stephens in identifying as Catterick, which was in Anglo-Saxon hands. They were opposed by a larger army from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia.

The battle at Catraeth has been seen as an attempt to resist the advance of the Angles, who had probably by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.

This interpretation has been accepted by most modern scholars. Jackson accepts the interpretation but suggests that a force of 300 men would be much too small to undertake the task demanded of them. He considers that the 300 mounted warriors would have been accompanied by a larger number of foot soldiers, not considered worthy of mention in the poem. Jarman also follows Williams&#x27; interpretation. Jackson suggested that after the fall of the kingdom of Gododdin, in or about 638, the poem was preserved in Strathclyde, which maintained its independence for several centuries. He considers that it was first written down in Strathclyde after a period of oral transmission, and may have reached Wales in manuscript form between the end of the 8th and the end of the 9th century. There would be particular interest in matters relating to the Gododdin in Gwynedd, since the founding myth of the kingdom involved the coming of Cunedda Wledig from Manaw Gododdin.

===Alternative interpretation===
In 1997, John T. Koch published a new study of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; which involved an attempt to reconstruct the original poetry written in what Koch terms &quot;Archaic Neo-Brittonic&quot;. This work also included a new and very different interpretation of the background of the poetry. He draws attention to a poem in &quot;Canu Taliesin&quot; entitled &quot;Gweith Gwen Ystrat&quot; (&#x27;Battle of Gwen Ystrat&#x27;):
There is also a reference to &quot;Catraeth&quot; in the slightly later poem &quot;Moliant Cadwallon&quot;, a panegyric addressed to Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd, thought to have been composed in about 633. Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as &quot;fierce Gwallawc wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth&quot;. He identifies Gwallawc as the &quot;Guallauc&quot; who was one of the kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien. Koch draws attention to the mention of &quot;meibion Godebawc&quot; (the sons of Godebog) as an enemy in stanza 15 of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of &quot;Coïl Hen Guotepauc&quot; (Coel Hen). He considers that, in view of the references in the three poems, there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat. This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c. 600 favoured by Williams and others. He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Britons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet, with Anglian allies on both sides, Rheged being in an alliance with Deira. He points out that according to the &quot;Historia Britonnum&quot; it was Rhun, son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanflæd of Deira, her father Edwin, and 12,000 of his subjects in 626 or 627. Urien Rheged was thus the real victor of the battle. &quot;Mynyddog Mwynfawr&quot; was not a person&#x27;s name but a personal description meaning &#x27;mountain feast&#x27; or &#x27;mountain chief&#x27;. Some aspects of Koch&#x27;s view of the historical context have been criticised by both Oliver Padel and Tim Clarkson. Clarkson, for example, makes the point that the reference in &quot;Gweith Gwen Ystrat&quot; is to &quot;the men of Catraeth&quot;; it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth, and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus, not Rhun, who baptized the Deirans.

==Editions and translations==
The first known translation of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; was by Evan Evans (&quot;Ieuan Fardd&quot;) who printed ten stanzas with a Latin translation in his book &quot;Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Ancient Welsh Bards&quot; in 1764. The full text was printed for the first time by Owen Jones in the in 1801. English translations of the poem were published by William Probert in 1820 and by John Williams (Ab Ithel) in 1852, followed by translations by William Forbes Skene in his &quot;Four Ancient Books of Wales&quot; (1866), and by Thomas Stephens for the Cymmrodorion Society in 1888. Gwenogvryn Evans produced a facsimile copy of the Book of Aneirin in 1908 and an edition with a translation in 1922.

The first reliable edition was &quot;Canu Aneirin&quot; by Ifor Williams with notes in Welsh, published in 1938. New translations based on this work were published by Kenneth H. Jackson in 1969 and, with modernized Welsh text and glossary, by Jarman in 1988. A colour facsimile edition of the manuscript with an introduction by Daniel Huws was published by South Glamorgan County Council and the National Library of Wales in 1989. John T. Koch&#x27;s new edition, which aimed to recreate the original text, appeared in 1997.

There have also been a number of translations which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study. Examples are the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in &quot;The earliest Welsh poetry&quot; (1970) and Steve Short&#x27;s 1994 translation.

==Cultural influence==
There are a number of references to &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; in later Medieval Welsh poetry. The well-known 12th-century poem &quot;Hirlas Owain&quot; by Owain Cyfeiliog, in which Owain praises his own war-band, likens them to the heroes of the Gododdin and uses &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; as a model. A slightly later poet, Dafydd Benfras, in a eulogy addressed to Llywelyn the Great, wishes to be inspired &quot;to sing as Aneirin sang / The day he sang the Gododdin&quot;. After this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in Wales for centuries until Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd) discovered the manuscript in the late 18th century. From the early 19th century onwards there are many allusions in Welsh poetry.

In English, &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; was a major influence on the long poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; (1937) by David Jones, in which he reflects on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; at the beginning of each of the seven sections of &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; as the basis of his difficult but much-admired poem &quot;For the Fallen&quot; (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran&#x27;s poem &quot;Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982&quot; opens with the line &quot;Men went to Catraeth&quot;, using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers&#x27;s Pink Mist (2012), an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.

The poem has also inspired a number of historical novels, including &quot;Men Went to Cattraeth&quot; (1969) by John James, &quot;The Shining Company&quot; (1990) by Rosemary Sutcliff, and &quot;The Amber Treasure&quot; (2009) by Richard J Denning. In 1989, the British industrial music band Test Dept. brought out an album titled &quot;Gododdin&quot;, in which the words of the poem were set to music, part in the original and part in English translation. This was a collaboration with the Welsh avant-garde theatre company Brith Gof and was performed in Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Scotland.

<doc id="1165440" wikidata="Q1140594" url="?curid=1165440" title="Nunhead Cemetery">
<text>Nunhead Cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London, England. It is perhaps the least famous and celebrated of them. The cemetery is located in Nunhead in the London Borough of Southwark and was originally known as All Saints&#x27; Cemetery. Nunhead Cemetery was consecrated in 1840 and opened by the London Cemetery Company. It is a Local Nature Reserve.

==Location==
The Main Gate (North Gate) is located on Linden Grove (near the junction with Daniel&#x27;s Road) and the South Gate is located on Limesford Road. The cemetery is in the London Borough of Southwark, SE15.

==History and description==
The cemetery was consecrated in 1840, with an Anglican chapel designed by Thomas Little. It is one of the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; Victorian cemeteries established in a ring around what were then the outskirts of London, and is one of two located south of the River Thames (the other being West Norwood). The first burial was of Charles Abbott, a 101-year-old Ipswich grocer; the last burial was of a volunteer soldier who became a canon of Lahore Cathedral. The first grave in Nunhead was dug in October 1840. The average annual number of burials over the ten years 1868–1878 was 1685: 1350 in the consecrated, and 335 in the unconsecrated ground.

Reinterred remains were removed from the cemetery in 1867 and 1933 from the site of the demolished St Christopher le Stocks church in the City of London.

The cemetery contains examples of the imposing monuments to the most eminent citizens of the day, which contrast sharply with the small, simple headstones marking common or public burials. By the middle of the 20th century the cemetery was nearly full, and so was abandoned by the United Cemetery Company. With the ensuing neglect, the cemetery gradually changed from lawn to meadow and eventually to woodland. It is now a local nature reserve and Site of Metropolitan Importance for wildlife, populated with songbirds, woodpeckers and tawny owls.
A lack of care and cash surrendered the graves to the ravages of nature and vandalism, but in the early 1980s the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery was formed to renovate and protect the cemetery.

The cemetery was reopened in May 2001 after an extensive restoration project funded by Southwark Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Fifty memorials were restored along with the Anglican Chapel.

==Layout and other structures==

At 52 acres, Nunhead is the second largest of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries. Views across London include St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The Victorian part of the cemetery is currently in a poor state of repair, being best described as an elegant wilderness; locals like to call it a nature reserve. Many areas of the cemetery are fairly overgrown with vines, as visible in newer tourist photos. Numerous tombstones lean to the side. Although the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery are doing their best to restore some parts of the cemetery it is badly in need of care and funding. It is about and is a popular place to walk.

The lodges and monumental entrance were designed by James Bunstone Bunning. There is an obelisk, the &quot;Scottish Political Martyrs Memorial&quot;, the second monument (the other is in Edinburgh) dedicated to the leaders of the Friends of the People Society, popularly called the Scottish Martyrs, including Thomas Muir, Maurice Margarot, and Thomas Fyshe Palmer, who were transported to Australia in 1794. It was erected by Radical MP Joseph Hume in 1851–52. It is immediately on the right on Dissenters Road, when entering through the North Gate.

A memorial commemorates nine Sea Scouts who died in the Leysdown Tragedy off the Isle of Sheppey in 1912, including Percy Baden Powell Huxford aged 12 (named after, but not related to, Lord Baden Powell). The original memorial, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was erected in 1914. Most of this was removed after vandalism, and only the base remains. The present replacement memorial was erected in 1992, on the initiative of the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery.
There are a large number of First and Second World War war graves in the cemetery, the greater proportion (592 graves) being Commonwealth service burials from the former war. Most of those are concentrated between three war graves plots: the United Kingdom plot (Square 89), holding 266 graves, the Australian plot which holds 23 graves, and the Canadian plot (Square 52) which holds 36 graves, including burials of South African and New Zealand servicemen. Those buried in the UK plot and in individual graves outside the three plots are, because of not being marked by headstones, listed by name on a Screen Wall memorial inside the cemetery&#x27;s main entrance. A second Screen Wall lists 110 Commonwealth service personnel of the Second World War who are buried in another war graves plot (Square 5), and elsewhere whose graves could not be marked by headstones. There is also a Belgian war grave of the First World War.

<text>Thomas Wentworth Higginson (December 22, 1823May 9, 1911), who went by the name Wentworth, was an American Unitarian minister, author, abolitionist, politician, and soldier. He was active in abolitionism in the United States during the 1840s and 1850s, identifying himself with disunion and militant abolitionism. He was a member of the Secret Six who supported John Brown. During the Civil War, he served as colonel of the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, the first federally authorized black regiment, from 1862 to 1864. Following the war, he wrote about his experiences with African-American soldiers and devoted much of the rest of his life to fighting for the rights of freed people, women, and other disfranchised peoples. He is also remembered as a mentor to poet Emily Dickinson.

==Early life and education==
Higginson was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 22, 1823. He was a descendant of Francis Higginson, a Puritan minister and one of the original settlers of the colony of Massachusetts Bay. His father, Stephen Higginson (born in Salem, Massachusetts, November 20, 1770; died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, February 20, 1834), was a merchant and philanthropist in Boston and bursar of Harvard University from 1818 until 1834. Through his mother he was related to Boston&#x27;s influential Storrow family. His grandfather, also named Stephen Higginson, was a member of the Continental Congress. He was a distant cousin of Henry Lee Higginson, founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, a great grandson of his grandfather. A third great grandfather was New Hampshire Lieutenant-Governor John Wentworth.

===Education and abolitionism===
Higginson entered Harvard College at age thirteen and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa at sixteen. He graduated in 1841 at age 18 and taught at a private school for four months, but he detested it and became &quot;a tutor of the three children of his Brookline cousin, Stephen Higginson Perkins&quot;. After that, in 1843, he became &quot;a nonmatriculated student at Harvard&quot;. In 1842 he became engaged to Mary Elizabeth Channing.

He then studied theology at the Harvard Divinity School. In 1845, at the end of his first year of divinity training, he withdrew from the school to turn his attention to the abolitionist cause. He spent the subsequent year studying and, following the lead of Transcendentalist Unitarian minister Theodore Parker, fighting against the expected war with Mexico. Believing that war was only an excuse to expand slavery and the Slave Power, Higginson wrote antiwar poems and went door to door to get signatures for antiwar petitions. With the split of the antislavery movement in the 1840s, Higginson subscribed to the Disunion Abolitionists, who believed that as long as slave states remained a part of the Union, the Constitution could never be amended to ban slavery.

===Marriage and family===
Higginson re-entered divinity school, and after graduating in 1847 and being ordained as the minister of a Newburyport Unitarian church (see below), he married Mary Channing. Mary was the daughter of Dr. Walter Channing, a pioneer in the field of obstetrics and gynecology who taught at Harvard University, the niece of Unitarian minister William Ellery Channing, and the sister of Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s friend Ellery Channing. Higginson and Mary Channing had no children but raised Margaret Fuller Channing, the eldest daughter of Ellen Fuller and Ellery Channing. Ellen was the sister of the Transcendentalist and feminist author, Margaret Fuller. Mary Channing died in 1877. Two years later Higginson married Mary Potter Thacher, with whom he had two daughters, one of whom survived into adulthood.

Higginson was also related to Harriet Higginson, whose Wooddale, Illinois, home was the first commission of famed architect Bertrand Goldberg in 1934.

==Career==
===Ministry===
Having graduated from divinity school, Higginson was called as pastor at the First Religious Society of Newburyport, Massachusetts, a Unitarian church known for its liberal Christianity. He supported the Essex County Antislavery Society and criticized the poor treatment of workers at Newburyport cotton factories. Additionally, the young minister invited Theodore Parker and fugitive slave William Wells Brown to speak at the church, and in sermons he condemned northern apathy towards slavery. In his role as board member of the Newburyport Lyceum and against the wishes of the majority of the board, Higginson brought Ralph Waldo Emerson to speak. Higginson proved too radical for the congregation and resigned in 1849. After that, he lectured on the Lyceum circuit, initially receiving about $15 for each talk (Theodore Parker and Ralph Waldo Emerson could command $25).

===Politics and militant abolitionism===
The Compromise of 1850 brought new challenges and new ambitions for the unemployed minister. He ran as the Free Soil Party candidate for Massachusetts&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in 1850 but lost. Higginson called upon citizens to uphold God&#x27;s law and disobey the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

He joined the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization whose purpose was to protect fugitive slaves from pursuit and capture. His joining of the group was inspired by the arrest and trial of the free black Frederick Jenkins, known as Shadrach. Abolitionists helped him escape to Canada. He participated with Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker in the attempt at freeing Thomas Sims, a Georgia slave who had escaped to Boston. In 1854, when the escaped Anthony Burns was threatened with extradition under the Fugitive Slave Act, Higginson led a small group who stormed the federal courthouse in Boston with battering rams, axes, cleavers, and revolvers. They could not prevent Burns from being taken back to the South. A courthouse guard was killed, proof that &quot;war had really begun.&quot; Higginson received a saber slash on his chin; he wore the scar proudly for the rest of his life.

In 1852, Higginson became pastor of the &quot;fervently anti-slavery&quot; Free Church in Worcester. During his tenure, Higginson not only supported abolition, but also temperance, labor rights, and rights of women.

Returning from a voyage to Europe for the health of his wife, who had an unknown illness, Higginson organized a group of men on behalf of the New England Emigration Aid Company to use peaceful means as tensions rose after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. The act divided the region into the Kansas and Nebraska territories, whose residents would separately vote on whether to allow slavery within each jurisdiction&#x27;s borders. Both abolitionist and pro-slavery supporters began to migrate to the territories. After his return, Higginson worked to keep activism aroused in New England by speechmaking, fundraising, and helping to organize the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee. He returned to the Kansas territory as an agent of the National Kansas Aid Committee, working to rebuild morale and distribute supplies—crates of rifles, revolvers, knives, ammunition, and a cannon—to settlers. Higginson became convinced that abolition could not be attained by peaceful methods. He celebrated Kansas as the equivalent of Bunker Hill; he called it a rehearsal for the violence to come.

As sectional conflict escalated, he continued to support disunion abolitionism, organizing the Worcester Disunion Convention in 1857, favoring the North&#x27;s secession from the slave-holding South and federal government. The convention asserted abolition as its primary goal, even if it would lead the country to war. Higginson was a fervent supporter of John Brown and is remembered as one of the &quot;Secret Six&quot; abolitionists who helped Brown raise money and procure supplies for his intended slave insurrection at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, West Virginia. When Brown was captured, Higginson tried to raise money for a trial defense and made plans to help the leader escape from prison, though he was ultimately unsuccessful. Other members of the Secret Six fled to Canada or elsewhere after Brown&#x27;s capture, but Higginson never fled, despite his involvement being common knowledge. Higginson was never arrested or called to testify.

In 1879, Higginson was elected to represent Cambridge&#x27;s first and fifth wards in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was re-elected in 1880. He made another run for U.S. House of Representatives in 1888 as a Democrat, but was defeated by Nathaniel P. Banks.

===Women&#x27;s rights activism===
Higginson was one of the leading male advocates of women&#x27;s rights during the decade before the Civil War. In 1853, he addressed the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention in support of a petition asking that women be allowed to vote on ratification of the new constitution. Published as &quot;Woman and Her Wishes,&quot; the address was used for many years in a women&#x27;s rights tract, as was an 1859 article he wrote for the Atlantic Monthly, &quot;Ought Women to Learn the Alphabet?&quot; A close friend and supporter of women&#x27;s rights leader Lucy Stone, he performed the marriage ceremony of Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell in 1855 and, by sending their protest of unjust marriage laws to the press, was responsible for their &quot;Marriage Protest&quot; becoming a famous document. Together with Stone, he compiled and published
&quot;The Woman&#x27;s Rights Almanac for 1858,&quot; which provided data such as income disparity between the sexes as well as a summary of gains made by the national movement during its first seven years.

He also compiled and published, in 1858, &quot;Consistent Democracy. The Elective Franchise for Women. Twenty-five Testimonies of Prominent Men,&quot; brief excerpts favoring woman suffrage from the speeches or writing of such men as Wendell Phillips, Henry Ward Beecher, William Henry Channing, Horace Greeley, Gerrit Smith, and various governors, legislators, and legislative reports. A member of the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Central Committee since 1853 or 1854, he was one of nine activists retained in that post when that large body of state representatives was reduced in 1858.

After the Civil War, Higginson was an organizer of the New England Woman Suffrage Association in 1868, and of the American Woman Suffrage Association the following year. He was one of the original editors of the suffrage newspaper &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, founded in 1870, and contributed a front-page column to it for fourteen years. As a two-year member of the Massachusetts legislature, 1880–82, he was a valuable link between suffragists and the legislature.

===Civil War years===

During the early part of the Civil War, Higginson was a captain in the 51st Massachusetts Infantry from November 1862 to October 1864, when he was retired because of a wound received in the preceding August. He was colonel of the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first authorized regiment recruited from freedmen for Union military service. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton required that black regiments be commanded by white officers. &quot;We, their officers, did not go there to teach lessons, but to receive them,&quot; Higginson wrote. &quot;There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred in all their lives.&quot;

Higginson described his Civil War experiences in &quot;Army Life in a Black Regiment&quot; (1870), He contributed to the preservation of Negro spirituals by copying dialect verses and music he heard sung around the regiment&#x27;s campfires. In his book, &quot;Drawn With the Sword&quot;, historian James M. McPherson cited Higginson as an example of a white officer in a black regiment who did not share the &quot;[p]owerful racial prejudices&quot; of others during the time period.

===Religious activism===
After the Civil War, Higginson became active in the Free Religious Association (FRA) and in 1870 delivered the speech &quot;The Sympathy of Religions&quot;, which was later published and circulated. The address argued that all religions shared essential truths and a common exhortation toward benevolence. Division among the faiths was ultimately artificial, he said: &quot;Every step in the progress of each brings it nearer to all the rest. For us, the door out of superstition and sin may be called Christianity; that is an historical name only, the accident of a birthplace. But other nations find other outlets; they must pass through their own doors.&quot; He pushed the FRA to tolerate even those who did not accept the liberal principles the Association espoused, asking, &quot;Are we as large as our theory? ... Are we as ready to tolerate ... the Evangelical man as the Mohammedan?&quot; Although his own relationship to evangelical Protestants remained strained, he saw the exclusion of any religious mindset as fundamentally dangerous to the organization. Higginson spoke at the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions in 1893 and praised the great strides that had been made in the mutual understanding of the world&#x27;s great religions, describing the Parliament as the culmination of the FRA&#x27;s greatest ambitions.

===Later years and death===

After the Civil War, he devoted most of his time to literature. His writings show a deep love of nature, art and humanity. In his &quot;Common Sense About Women&quot; (1881) and his &quot;Women and Men&quot; (1888), he advocated equality of opportunity and equality of rights for men and women.

In 1874, Higginson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

In 1891, Higginson became one of the founders of the Society of American Friends of Russian Freedom (SAFRF). He edited its public appeal &quot;To the Friends of Russian Freedom&quot;. Later, in 1907 Higginson was the vice-president of the SAFRF.

In 1905, he joined with Jack London, Clarence Darrow, and Upton Sinclair to form the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. Higginson was an Advisory Editor for the second attempt at the &quot;Massachusetts Magazine&quot;.

Higginson died May 9, 1911. Although his death record states that he was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he is actually buried in Cambridge Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the intersection of Riverview, Lawn, and Prospect paths.

==Beliefs==
Higginson&#x27;s deep conviction in the evils of slavery stemmed in part from his mother&#x27;s influence. He greatly admired abolitionists, who, despite persecution, showed courage and commitment to the worthy cause. The writings of William Lloyd Garrison and Lydia Maria Child were particularly influential to Higginson&#x27;s abolitionist enthusiasm during the early 1840s. Higginson claimed that Child&#x27;s book, &quot;An Appeal in Favor of That Class of Americans Called Africans&quot;, first convinced him to speak against slavery.

===Homeopathy===
Higginson was a strong advocate of homeopathy. In 1863, he wrote to his wife Mary Channing Higginson: &quot;and also Ms. Laura Towne, the homeopathic physician of the department, chief teacher and probably the most energetic person this side of civilisation [sic]: a person of splendid health and astonishing capacity... I think she has done more for me than anyone else by prescribing homeopathic arsenic as a tonic, one powder every day on rising, and it has already, I think (3 doses) affected me.&quot;

===Political parties and ideology===
In 1850, Higginson was the Free Soil Party candidate for Congress and lost. Subsequently, he was successively a Republican, an Independent and a Democrat. He described having had an interest in his early youth in Brook Farm and Fourierism.

==Relationship with Emily Dickinson==

Higginson is remembered as a correspondent and literary mentor to the poet Emily Dickinson.

In April 1862, Higginson published an article in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, titled &quot;Letter to a Young Contributor,&quot; in which he advised budding young writers to step up. Emily Dickinson, a 32-year-old woman from Amherst, Massachusetts, sent a letter to Higginson, enclosing four poems and asking, &quot;Are you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?&quot; (Letter 260) He was not – his reply included gentle &quot;surgery&quot; (that is, criticism) of Dickinson&#x27;s raw, odd verse, questions about Dickinson&#x27;s personal and literary background, and a request for more poems.

Higginson&#x27;s next reply contained high praise, causing Dickinson to reply that it &quot;gave no drunkenness&quot; only because she had &quot;tasted rum before&quot;; she still, though, had &quot;few pleasures so deep as your opinion, and if I tried to thank you, my tears would block my tongue&quot; (Letter 265). In the same letter, Higginson warned her against publishing her poetry because of its unconventional form and style.

Gradually, Higginson became Dickinson&#x27;s mentor and &quot;preceptor,&quot; and he visited her twice, in 1870 and 1873, at her home in Amherst. Higginson never felt that he fully understood Dickinson. &quot;The bee himself did not evade the schoolboy more than she evaded me,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and even at this day I still stand somewhat bewildered, like the boy.&quot; (&quot;Emily Dickinson&#x27;s Letters,&quot; &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, October 1891) After Dickinson&#x27;s death, Higginson collaborated with Mabel Loomis Todd in publishing volumes of her poetry – heavily edited in favor of conventional punctuation, diction, and rhyme. In &quot;White Heat&quot; (Knopf, 2008), an account of Higginson&#x27;s friendship with Dickinson, author Brenda Wineapple credits Higginson with more editorial sensitivity than literary historians have previously noted. Higginson&#x27;s prominence within intellectual circles helped to promote Dickinson&#x27;s poetry, which remained strange and startling even in its altered form.

<text>Harry Thomas Patterson (11 June 1920 – 23 February 2005) was a Stratford, Ontario born journalist who went on to found the Stratford Festival of Canada, then called the Stratford Shakespearean Festival, the largest theatre festival in Canada.

== Biography ==
Patterson was a veteran of World War II and a journalist writing for Maclean&#x27;s magazine in the early 1950s. From the time that he was a teenager, he had thought that his home town of Stratford, Ontario should be home to performances of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. The town was suffering from industrial decline due to the declining fortunes of the rail industry. Patterson, with no experience of the theatre, proposed the idea of a theatre festival. In 1952, he invited the prominent British director Tyrone Guthrie to visit Stratford and help bring their idea of a Shakespearean theatre to fruition. When Guthrie accepted the offer to visit, national newspapers started to take notice. Patterson told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; he wanted to provide &quot;Canadian acting talent the opportunity to work with top directors and actors without having to leave the country&quot;. For his part, Guthrie was interested in a venture that &quot;offers a fresh advance in the production of Shakespeare&quot;.

With Guthrie supporting the Festival idea, Patterson persuaded the town council to back it, and had an enthusiastic committee of local citizens to help organize it. Guthrie advised him to hire a big name for the first production, so Patterson received a small loan from the city council so he could visit Alec Guinness and invite him to perform in the opening season. The festival has grown and expanded significantly since that time.

Patterson served as the festival&#x27;s general manager during the first season and worked in other capacities until 1967. He also founded the touring company Canadian Players with actor Douglas Campbell and took part in the establishment of a number of cultural institutions, including the Canadian Theatre Centre and the National Theatre School. Patterson was also the founder of the Dawson City Gold Rush Festival.

Patterson was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1967 and was also awarded the Order of Ontario. He also received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario. One of the festival theatres was named after him in 1991, as is one of the islands in the Avon River.

His memoirs, First Stage: The making of the Stratford Festival, co-authored with Allan Gould, were published in 1986.

<doc id="1165464" wikidata="Q7848584" url="?curid=1165464" title="Trypanothione">
<text>Trypanothione is an unusual form of glutathione containing two molecules of glutathione joined by a spermidine (polyamine) linker. It is found in parasitic protozoa such as leishmania and trypanosomes. These protozoal parasites are the cause of leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness and Chagas&#x27; disease. Trypanothione was discovered by Alan Fairlamb. Its structure was proven by chemical synthesis. It is present mainly in the Kinetoplastida but can be found in other parasitic protozoa such as &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;. Since this thiol is absent from humans and is essential for the survival of the parasites, the enzymes that make and use this molecule are targets for the development of new drugs to treat these diseases.

Trypanothione-dependent enzymes include reductases, peroxidases, glyoxalases and transferases. Trypanothione-disulfide reductase (TryR) was the first trypanothione-dependent enzyme to be discovered (EC 1.8.1.12). It is an NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme that reduces trypanothione disulfide. TryR is essential for survival of these parasites both &quot;in vitro&quot; and in the human host.

A major function of trypanothione is in the defence against oxidative stress. Here, trypanothione-dependent enzymes such as tryparedoxin peroxidase (TryP) reduce peroxides using electrons donated either directly from trypanothione, or via the redox intermediate tryparedoxin (TryX). Trypanothione-dependent hydrogen peroxide metabolism is particularly important in these organisms because they lack catalase. Since the trypanosomatids also lack an equivalent of thioredoxin reductase, trypanothione reductase is the sole path that electrons can take from NADPH to these antioxidant enzymes.

<doc id="1165472" wikidata="Q14711938" url="?curid=1165472" title="Vermont Teddy Bear Company">
<text>The Vermont Teddy Bear Company (VTB) is one of the largest producers of teddy bears and the largest seller of teddy bears by mail order and Internet. The company handcrafts each of its teddy bears and produces almost 500,000 teddy bears each year. The company was formerly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol BEAR, but was taken private by The Mustang Group, a Boston-based private equity firm, on September 30, 2005, partially to avoid the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On April 8th, 2024, The Vermont Flannel Company announced it had acquired VTB. 

==History==
The company was founded in 1981 by John Sortino, who sold handcrafted teddy bears in an open-air market in Burlington, Vermont. Sortino happened upon the idea of packaging and selling bears through the mail when a tourist visiting Burlington wanted a bear mailed to her home. The concept was called the &quot;Bear-Gram&quot;, which features the customized teddy bear placed in a box (complete with an &quot;air hole&quot;) and stuffed with other goodies.

By 1995, VTB had sponsored on the U.S. East Coast various guns-for-bears exchanges and expanded to the U.S. West Coast in 1996 starting with UC Irvine&#x27;s Student Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Brea Police Department.

In May 1997, the Vermont Teddy Bear Co. filed a copyright infringement suit against Disney over &quot;Pooh-Grams&quot; being similar to its mail-order &quot;Bear-Gram&quot; trademark and logo.

VTB acquired Calyx &amp; Corolla, an upscale flower company headquartered in Vero Beach, Florida, in 2003 but is no longer associated with VTB. One of Vermont Teddy Bear&#x27;s marketing slogans claimed that sending a teddy bear is &quot;a creative alternative to sending flowers.&quot; In 2005, the company launched a new sister company, Gift Bag Boutique, which offered handbags and purses along with many make-up accessories. Along with PajamaGram, which sold gift pajamas, and TastyGram, which offered gourmet food gifts, the creation of this sister company brought the total number of companies under the Vermont Teddy Bear umbrella to five. Gift Bag Boutique and TastyGram stopped accepting orders as of June 26, 2008.

==Controversy==
For Valentine&#x27;s Day of 2005, Vermont Teddy Bear caused widespread controversy by offering a &quot;Crazy for You&quot; Bear which wore a white strait jacket with a red heart embroidered and a tag entitled &quot;Commitment Papers&quot; came with the bear. When mental health groups from all over the U.S. asked for the bear to be pulled out of production, VTB kept the bear up for sale but sold out quickly and Elizabeth Robert, the company head, resigned from the board of Vermont&#x27;s largest hospital, Fletcher Allen Health Care. Then, in May of that year VTB agreed to be acquired by a Mustang-Group-led investment group for $6.50 a share.

== Factory and Retail Store ==
In 1995, the company moved into its new headquarters in Shelburne in Vermont&#x27;s Champlain Valley. A satellite factory in Newport was closed in June 2010. A popular tourist destination, the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory in Shelburne offers tours of their factory, hosting over 50,000 visitors every year. 

The &quot;Make a Friend for Life&quot; room at the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory allows visitors to participate in assembling a bear for purchase. The customer selects the fur, stuffing, and accessories, after which a representative completes the sewing and assists in filling out the bear&#x27;s &quot;birth certificate.&quot; Through the Vermont Cub Project, founded in 2017, the company offers coupons for Vermonters four years of age to make a free Vermont Teddy Bear.

== Product Lines ==
Vermont Teddy Bear has a wide product range of over 300+ items, the most popular being the 15&quot; Jointed Bears in honey color. The bears can also come in Buttercream, Vanilla, Black Licorice, Gray, Pink, as well as longer premium fur colors Maple, Espresso and Snow. VTB also has a wide range of outfits available for most occasions and events. They recently have started carrying a variety of other animals including sloths, monkeys, and even dragons. 

Every Vermont Teddy Bear is 100% unconditionally guaranteed for life. That means that if anything ever happens to your Bear you can send it to the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory and they will nurse him or her back to health in the Bear Hospital at no charge. In the very sad event that your Bear is too badly injured and has no hope for a complete recovery, they will replace your Bear with a new one for free.

In addition to the regular teddy bears they also release limited edition bears with a very small quantity produced usually in editions of 35 or 50.

==Advertising==
VTB was listed among &quot;&#x27;a broad range of direct marketers&#x27; pitched by the show&#x27;s hosts themselves&quot; who were taking out more ads on talk radio in 2010, according to Dan Metter, director of talk-radio sales of Premiere Radio Networks.

<text>The Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) is a White House-directed emergency telephone service provided by a division of the Department of Homeland Security. GETS uses enhancements based on existing commercial technology

== Purpose ==
GETS supports federal, state, local, and tribal government, industry, and non-governmental organization personnel during crisis or emergencies by providing emergency access and priority processing for local and long-distance telephone calls on the public switched telephone network. GETS is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation when the public switched telephone network is congested and the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means is reduced.

GETS is necessary because reliance on telecommunications has been accompanied by an increased vulnerability to network congestion and system failures. Although backup systems are in place, disruptions in service can still occur. Natural disasters, power outages, fiber cable cuts, and software problems can cripple the telephone services of entire regions. Additionally, congestion in the public switched telephone network, such as the well-documented &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day phenomenon&quot;, in which Mother&#x27;s Day generally has the highest blocking of long-distance telephone calls of any single day of the year, can prevent access to circuits. However, during times of emergency, crisis, or war, government personnel and emergency workers need to know that their calls will go through.

For cellular telephone users, a related capability is offered by the Nationwide Wireless Priority Service (WPS). WPS users have the ability to queue at the top for the next available communications channel to their registered base station in order to place their call by dialing , greatly enhancing their ability to complete wireless calls during times of congestion. WPS is available only to designated leadership at all government levels, national security, emergency responders, and private sector critical infrastructure personnel, as approved by the NCS and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Rules and Requirements.

GETS uses these major types of networks:
* The local networks provided by local exchange carriers and wireless providers, such as cellular carriers and personal communications services (PCS)
* The major long-distance networks provided by interexchange carriers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint, including their international services
* Government-leased networks, including the Federal Technology Service and the Defense Switched Network

In accordance with Section 1(g)5 of Executive Order 12472, the NCS also performs research and development to further enhance the GETS and WPS services through the use of new packet-based technologies (such as IP, or Internet Protocol). This work is done in the NCS&#x27; lab, formerly referred to as the eXperimental Testbed Environment. The multi-vendor lab is in the process of preparation for interoperability tests with other labs and research groups to validate these new approaches in today&#x27;s Next Generation Networks (NGNs). Interoperability between NGNs and legacy telephone systems will continue to be an area of high interest and more elaborate studies for the NCS and their Committee of Principals throughout the transition from these legacy systems.

== Accessibility ==
GETS is accessed through a dialing plan and Personal Identification Number (PIN) card verification system. Using common telephone equipment, the user dials the universal access number 710-627-4387 (710-NCS-GETS). A prompt directs the entry of the user&#x27;s assigned twelve-digit PIN and the destination telephone number. Once the user is authenticated as valid, the call receives special treatment. When dealing with GETS User Assistance, users may need to provide a registered password of 4 to 9 alphanumeric characters for those cards issued to an individual rather than through stockpile.

==Effectiveness==
GETS is designed to provide a 90% call completion rate when call volume is eight times normal capacity.

<doc id="1165478" wikidata="Q4667534" url="?curid=1165478" title="Leiomyoma">
<text>A leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.

The word is from &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &#x27;smooth-muscle tumor&#x27;. The plural form can be either the English &quot;leiomyomas&quot; or the classical &quot;leiomyomata&quot;.

==Uterus==


Uterine fibroids are leiomyomata of the uterine smooth muscle. As other leiomyomata, they are benign, but may lead to excessive menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), often cause anemia and may lead to infertility.

A rare form of these tumors is uterine lipoleiomyoma—benign tumors consisting of a mixture of adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. Uterine lipoleiomyomata have been observed together with ovarian and other pathologies and some of them may develop into liposarcoma. These tumors are monoclonal, and non-random chromosomal abnormalities have been seen in 40% of the tumors.

==Gallbladder==
Mesenchymal neoplasms of the gallbladder are rare and in particular leiomyomas of the gallbladder have been rarely reported, all of them in patients with immune system disorders. However, a case was reported in absence of associated immunodeficiency at Monash Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, in a healthy 39-year-old woman with no symptoms.

==Skin==
Leiomyomas of the skin are generally (1) acquired, and (2) divided into several categories:

*Solitary cutaneous leiomyoma
*Multiple cutaneous (or pilar) leiomyomas arising from the arrectores pilorum muscles
*Angioleiomyomas (vascular leiomyomas) that are thought to arise from vascular smooth muscle
*Dartoic (or genital) leiomyomas originating in the dartos muscles of the genitalia, areola, and nipple
*Angiolipoleiomyoma

==Esophagus, stomach and small intestines==
Leiomyoma is the most common benign mesenchymal tumor of esophagus and second most common benign tumor of the small bowel (with gastrointestinal stromal tumor as most common). Although leiomyoma is the most common benign esophageal tumor, malignant carcinoma is still 50 times more likely. Approximately 50% of cases are found in the jejunum, followed by the ileum in 31% of cases. Almost one half of all lesions are less than 5 centimeters.

==Other locations, metastatic leiomyoma==
* Metastatic leiomyoma are an extremely rare complication after surgery to remove the uterus for uterine fibroids. The most frequent sites of occurrence are the lungs and pelvis. The lesions are hormonally responsive.
* Fibromyoma of the breast is an extremely rare benign breast neoplasm. Most reports in literature mention a history of hysterectomy for uterine fibroids, although the question of whether these fibromyomas are possibly metastases of the uterine fibroids has not been investigated. An alternative hypothesis is an origin from the smooth muscle of the nipple.
*Leiomyoma may spontaneously occur in any muscle. Depending on the location of the tumor, identification may not be timely until overall mass becomes undeniably noticeable. The symptoms for a 30-year-old male with a 10 cm leiomyoma included &quot;dead leg&quot; pains. Tumor was intertwined with quadriceps muscles, making identification and excision difficult. Tumor was successfully excised with only minor rehabilitation required.

==Familial leiomyoma==
*Associated with papillary variant of renal cell carcinoma and multiple cutaneous leiomyoma. Defect is in the fumarate hydratase gene in the long arm of chromosome 1.

<text>Phillips Brooks (December 13, 1835January 23, 1893) was an American Episcopal clergyman and author, long the Rector of Boston&#x27;s Trinity Church and briefly Bishop of Massachusetts. He wrote the lyrics of the Christmas hymn, &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;.

He is honored on the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar on January 23.

==Background==

===Early life and education===
Born in Boston, Brooks was descended through his father, William Gray Brooks, from the Rev. John Cotton; through his mother, Mary Ann Phillips, he was a great-grandson of Samuel Phillips, Jr., founder of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Three of Brooks&#x27; five brothersFrederic, Arthur, and John Cottonwere eventually ordained in the Episcopal Church.

Phillips Brooks prepared for college at the Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard University in 1855 at the age of 20, where he was elected to the A.D. Club. He worked briefly as a school teacher at Boston Latin, but, upon being fired, felt that he had failed miserably. He wrote, &quot;I do not know what will become of me and I do not care much... I wish I were fifteen years old again. I believe I might become a stunning man: but somehow or other I do not seem in the way to come to much now.&quot; In 1856, he began to study for ordination in the Episcopal Church in the Virginia Theological Seminary at Alexandria, Virginia. While a seminarian there, he preached at Sharon Chapel (now All Saints Episcopal Church, Sharon Chapel) in nearby Fairfax County.

===Pastoral career===

In 1859, he graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary, was ordained deacon by Bishop William Meade of Virginia, and became rector of the Church of the Advent in Philadelphia. In 1860, he was ordained priest, and in 1862, became rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia, where he remained seven years, gaining an increasing name as a Broad churchman, preacher, and patriot. In addition to his moral stature, he was a man of great physical bearing as well, standing tall.

During the American Civil War he upheld the cause of the North and opposed slavery, and his sermon on the death of Abraham Lincoln was an eloquent expression of the character of both men. His sermon at Harvard&#x27;s commemoration of the Civil War dead in 1865 likewise attracted attention nationwide. In 1869 he became rector of Trinity Church, Boston; today, his statue is located on the left exterior of the church.

Brooks wrote that his only ambition was &quot;to be a parish priest and, though not much of one, [I] would as a college president be still less&quot;. Under his inspiration, architect Henry Hobson Richardson, muralist John LaFarge, and stained glass artists William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones created an architectural masterpiece in Trinity Church, Boston. Among the building&#x27;s notable features was the first freestanding liturgical altar in the United States in an overall chancel design that attracted attention for its Liturgical Movement influence even in British architectural magazines. Behind the free standing altar there was another revival from the early church chancel, a great for priests that surrounded the apse. Because Massachusetts had two bishops then, the bishops&#x27; chairs were placed within the altar rail to either side of the holy table. There were no choir stalls to distract from the central altar, which was hardly recognized as an altar in a period when most altars were backed up to elaborate carved screens. Until 1888, there was also no pulpit. Brooks preferred to preach his legendary sermons from a modest lectern near the rector&#x27;s stall on the south side of the chancel. There was also an eagle lectern on a balustraded ambo in the center at the chancel steps.

Such was the magnificence of Trinity Church that, in his chapter on Phillips Brooks&#x27; chancel in &quot;Ralph Adams Cram: An Architect&#x27;s Four Quests,&quot; Douglass Shand-Tucci calls it &quot;an American Hagia Sophia&quot;, a reflection of Brooks&#x27; architectural and liturgical tastes, disclosed in his travel writings, where in Germany for instance he referred to &quot;thrilling music&quot; and &quot;thrilling incense&quot; in respect to a liturgy he attended there in the Roman Catholic cathedral. Holy Week in Rome also greatly moved him, especially the papal high mass on Easter. Although he despaired of Anglo-Catholic ritualism, he championed many aspects of the liturgical movement, including congregational singing during the liturgy. At the Eucharist, for instance, he would preach, not from the pulpit, but from the chancel steps, and although he liked to preach in a black academic gown, he never failed to appear in a commodious white surplice and priest&#x27;s stole when he officiated at the office or Eucharist.

The building of Trinity was completed in 1877, but the Venetian mosaics that Brooks and Richardson wanted could not be afforded. It was not until the magnificent new altar and sanctuary of Maginnis &amp; Walsh were completed in 1938 that Trinity&#x27;s chancel reflected that aspect of their dreams for Trinity, which Brooks called &quot;America&#x27;s glory forever&quot;. Brooks preached there Sunday after Sunday to large congregations until he was consecrated Bishop of Massachusetts in 1891. He had previously declined an election as assistant bishop of Pennsylvania in 1886.

He was for many years an overseer and preacher of Harvard University. In 1881, he declined an invitation to be the sole preacher to the university and professor of Christian ethics. On April 30, 1891, he was elected sixth Bishop of Massachusetts, and on October 14 was consecrated to that office in Trinity Church.

He died unmarried in 1893, after an episcopate of only 15 months. His death was a major event in the history of Boston. One observer reported: &quot;They buried him like a king. Harvard students carried his body on their shoulders. All barriers of denomination were down. Roman Catholics and Unitarians felt that a great man had fallen in Israel.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==

===Publications===

In 1877, Brooks published a course of lectures upon preaching that he had delivered at the theological school of Yale University, and which are an expression of his own experience. In 1879, the &quot;Bohlen Lectures on The Influence of Jesus&quot; came out. In 1878, he published his first volume of sermons, and from time to time issued other volumes, including &quot;Sermons Preached in English Churches&quot; (1883) and &quot;&quot;The Candle of the Lord&quot; and Other Sermons&quot; (1895). Brooks was also famous and beloved for his collections of sermons, &quot;The Purpose and Use of Comfort&quot;, first published in 1878, which includes the title sermon as well as: &quot;The Withheld Completions of Life,&quot; &quot;The Conqueror from Edom,&quot; &quot;Keeping the Faith,&quot; &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Refuge in God,&quot; &quot;The Man with One Talent,&quot; &quot;The Food of Man, &quot;The Symbol and the Reality,&quot; &quot;Is It I?&quot;, and others.

Today, he is probably best known for authoring the Christmas carol &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot;. Brooks also introduced Helen Keller to Christianity and to Anne Sullivan.

===Awards and historical monuments===

Brooks&#x27;s understanding of individuals and of other religious traditions gained a following across a broad segment of society, as well as increased support for the Episcopal Church. Within his lifetime, he received honorary degrees from Harvard (1877) and Columbia (1887), and the Doctor of Divinity degree by the University of Oxford, England (1885).

In addition, his close ties with Harvard University led to the creation of Phillips Brooks House in Harvard Yard, built seven years after his death. On January 23, 1900, it was dedicated to serve &quot;the ideal of piety, charity, and hospitality&quot;. The Phillips Brooks House originally housed a Social Service Committee, which became the Phillips Brooks House Association in 1904. It ceased formal religious affiliation in the 1920s, but remains in operation as a student-run group of volunteer organizations. Brooks&#x27; theological alma mater, Virginia Theological Seminary, honors him with a statue outside its library.

A statue of Phillips Brooks stands on the North Andover, Massachusetts, Town Common, facing North Parish Church.


Alexander Viets Griswold Allen, an Episcopal clergyman and professor of ecclesiastical history at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, published several biographical works on Brooks. These included the two-volume &quot;Phillips Brooks, Life and Letters&quot; (1901) and the abbreviated and revised one-volume &quot;Phillips Brooks&quot; (1907), both published in New York. In 1961, Raymond W. Albright published another biography of Brooks entitled &quot;Focus on Infinity&quot;. His contemporary biographer is Douglass Shand-Tucci, who published a chapter on the bishop in &quot;Ralph Adams Cram: an Architects Four Quests&quot; in 2005, and in 2009 on the website of Back Bay Historical/The Global Boston Perspective and elaborated as &quot;The Saint Bishop and the American Hagia Sophia&quot; in an October 2009 lecture at the New England Historical Genealogical Society in Boston as part of &quot;The Gods of Copley Square&quot; series. Another contemporary biographer, examining the preacher&#x27;s evangelical legacy, is Gillis J. Harp, who has written a major study, &quot;Brahmin Prophet : Phillips Brooks and the Path of Liberal Protestantism&quot;.

A private elementary school in Menlo Park, CaliforniaPhillips Brooks Schoolis named for him, as is Brooks School in his hometown of North Andover, Massachusetts, the latter founded by Endicott Peabody, who also founded the Groton School. The Brooks family founded a Brooks Memorial School in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874 in memory of Phillips&#x27; brother, the Rev. Frederic Brooks, who died in an accident in Cambridge. That school was sponsored in part by John D. Rockefeller and operated under the Brooks name until 1891; it currently operates under the name of the Hathaway Brown School. John S. White, first headmaster of the school in Cleveland, also founded a Phillips Brooks School in Philadelphia in 1904 that operated there until 1919.

The Episcopal Church remembers Phillips Brooks annually on January 23, the anniversary of his death. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<doc id="1165497" wikidata="Q2394444" url="?curid=1165497" title="Stop! In the Name of Love">
<text>&quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; is a 1965 song recorded by the Supremes for the Motown label.

Written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; held the number 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in the United States from March 27, 1965, through April 3, 1965, and reached the number 2 position on the soul chart.

&quot;Billboard&quot; named the song number 38 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time. The BBC ranked &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; at number 56 on &quot;The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart&quot;, which ranks Motown releases by their all time UK downloads and streams.

In 2001, the 1965 recording of &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; by The Supremes was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2021, it was listed at No. 254 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==History==
The song was written by Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Brian Holland. Dozier said that he got the idea after he got cheated on by his girlfriend. In the heat of the argument, he said, &quot;Baby, please stop. In the name of love- before you break my heart.&quot;

The Supremes recorded &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; in January 1965 and released as a single on February 8. The song was included on the Supremes&#x27; sixth album, &quot;More Hits by The Supremes&quot;, and was nominated for the 1966 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Rock &amp; Roll Group Vocal Performance, losing to &quot;Flowers on the Wall&quot; by the Statler Brothers.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a rousing, shufflin’ pop-blues romancer about a gal who cautions her boyfriend to go a little bit slower&quot; that should &quot;continue in [the Supremes] fantastic chart-riding ways.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said &quot;These girls can&#x27;t be stopped. And so they have another one that is on its way to the top spot. Diana, Florence and Marie have the knack and so does their home base, Motown Records.&quot;

The Supremes&#x27; choreography for this song involved one hand on the hip and the other outstretched in a &quot;stop&quot; gesture. They performed it on an episode of the ABC variety program &quot;Shindig!&quot; which aired on Wednesday, February 24, 1965.
