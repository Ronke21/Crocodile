<text>The Croatian National Bank (; ), known until 1997 as the National Bank of Croatia (), is the Croatian member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Croatia from 1991 to 2022, issuing the Croatian dinar until 1994 and subsequently the Croatian kuna until Croatian adoption of the euro on . It has also been Croatia&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision since 2020. It was initially established in 1972 under the decentralization of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, and became a fully-fledged central bank in late 1991 with the independence of Croatia.

The acronym for the National Bank in Croatian, as used in their logo, is HNB. The Bank uses the English-language acronym CNB in its publications in English.

The CNB&#x27;s role was specified by the Constitution of Croatia which was passed by the Parliament of Croatia on 21 December 1990. In performing its duties, the CNB acts as an independent institution responsible to the Parliament. The bank has a share capital of 335,000,000 euros (c. US$450 million).

==History==

On 21 December 1990, the Constitution of Croatia, determined in article 53, named the National Bank as Croatia&#x27;s central bank, and declared its responsibilities: &quot;The National Bank is central bank of Republic of Croatia. The National Bank is responsible, within its rights and duties, for stability of the currency and for liquidity of payments in state and abroad. The National Bank is independent in its activity and responsible to Croatian Sabor. Profits made by National Bank belong to Croatian state budget. The position of the National Bank is established by law.&quot; In accordance with that provision, the National Bank was established under Croatian Law by Government Regulation of , a provisional act made permanent by legislation of November 1992.

In June 1995, even before the Croatian War of Independence had come to an end, the National Bank organized the first Dubrovnik Economic Conference (DEC), an annual event that has been held without interruption since then, including in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

By amendments of Constitution of Croatia in 1997, the Bank&#x27;s earlier name &quot;National Bank of Croatia&quot; () was changed to &quot;Croatian National Bank&quot; (). Also in 1997, the CNB became a full member of the Bank for International Settlements; Banking sector restructuring occurred throughout the 1990s, culminating in the resignation of all members of the CNB&#x27;s Council led by Governor Marko Škreb in July 2000 in response to the Croatian Parliament&#x27;s refusal to accept its report for 1998 and the first half of 1999.

Boris Vujčić joined the National Bank as head of its Research Department in 1996, became its Deputy Governor in 2000, and assumed the role of Governor in 2012.

==Operations==

The Croatian National Bank is the central bank of the Republic of Croatia and part of the European System of Central Banks. The primary objective of the CNB is maintaining price stability and the stability of the financial system as a whole. The Croatian National Bank executes monetary policy, manages international reserves of the Republic of Croatia, issues the Croatian currency - the kuna, issues authorisations of credit institutions, credit unions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions and supervises their operation. The CNB also issues authorisations of authorised exchange offices.

The Croatian National Bank is autonomous and independent in achieving its objective and carrying out its tasks. The CNB reports on its work to the Croatian Parliament.

===Independence===

The independence of the central bank is a key precondition for a successful and credible implementation of monetary policy and for the achievement of the main objective of the central bank - maintenance of price stability.

The independence of the Croatian National Bank is in accordance with Article 130 of the Treaty on European Union, which guarantees the independence of national central banks of the European Union. There are several aspects of central bank independence: functional, institutional, personal and financial. Functional independence implies a clearly defined objective and autonomy in the choice of measures and instruments for its realisation. Institutional independence means that central bank decisions are independent from the influence of other institutions. Personal independence guarantees the protection of CNB officials from external pressures, excludes conflicts of interest and precisely defines the conditions for the appointment and removal from office of the Governor and other members of the CNB Council. Financial independence implies the possibility for the CNB to autonomously obtain funds for the purpose of executing its mandate, with the income and expense determined by the monetary policy stance.

===Monetary stability===
Stable prices is the main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by making sure price increases meet the Government&#x27;s inflation target.&lt;ref name=&quot;hnb.hr/o-hnb&quot;&gt;hnb.hr/o-hnb &lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial stability===
Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank&#x27;s surveillance and market intelligence functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations. 
The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability.

==Head office building==

The seat of the CNB in central Zagreb, designed by architect Viktor Kovačić, was erected for the Zagreb Stock and Commodity Exchange and inaugurated in 1927. It has been used by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, then by the National Bank of Croatia since the end of World War II.

<text>Prince Ioan Sandu Sturdza or Ioniță Sandu Sturdza (1762 – 2 February 1842) was the ruler (hospodar) of Moldavia from 21 June 1822 to 5 May 1828.

==Biography==

Sturdza is considered the first indigenous ruler with the end of Phanariote rule (as a move the Ottoman Empire undertook after seeing the political disadvantages of Greek domination after the troubles in the Greek War of Independence).

Immediately after the Greek revolution, Prince Ioan Sturdza took an active part in subduing the roving bands of Eterists in Moldavia; he transformed the Greek language elementary schools into Romanian language ones and laid the foundation for that scientific national development which Prince Mihai Sturdza continued after 1834, especially after his founding of an upper school in the Trei Ierarhi Cathedral complex in Iași. Although his project for the confiscation of some Church properties was initially blocked by Russia, Sturdza opted not to revise his position.

Opposed by the boyars who had taken refuge in Imperial Russia during Ypsilanti&#x27;s military rule, and threatened with the loss of his throne after the 1826 Russo-Turkish Akkerman Convention that established a seven-year term in office for Princes elected by the Sfatul boieresc (confirmed by the Ottomans, with Russia&#x27;s approval), Sturdza agreed to many boyar demands, including tax cuts and exemptions from conscription. However, he ensured meritocratic criteria in access to public offices. At the same time, a conflict became apparent between high- and low-ranking boyars, after the proposed constitution of Ionică Tăutu was rejected by most of the former (a vocal minority under the leadership of Mihail Sturdza). In 1828, the Russians entered the country during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29 and took Prince Ioan prisoner. He died while being kept in Bessarabia and was later buried in Iași.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Princess Ecaterina Rosetti-Roznoveanu (1764-1847). They had:

* Prince Nicolae, married Princess Maria Ghika-Comanesti (1805-1887), they had three daughters:
** Princess Ecaterina Sturdza (b. 1826), married as his second wife Prince Constantin Moruzi (1819-1886), Chamberlain at the Imperial Court of Russia.
** Princess Zoe Sturdza, married Prince Ioan Cantacuzino-Paşcanu (1827-1891), who served as general director of the Theater 
** Princess Pulcheria (1831-1874), married Colonel Peter Keșco (1830–1865) and became mother of Queen Natalie of Serbia and grandmother of King Alexander I of Serbia.

<text>Jayanagara is a mixed residential and commercially developed neighbourhood in Bengaluru, India. It is one of the zones of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. It is sub-divided into seven wards. It is surrounded by Basavanagudi, JP Nagar, Wilson Garden, Banashankari 2nd stage, Gurappanapalya, Suddaguntepalya and BTM Layout among other areas. It is in proximity to the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens. Jayanagar has 10 area blocks (including 4th &#x27;T&#x27; Block), of which the 3rd and 4th blocks are largely commercial hubs, while the rest are mostly residential.

A 2010 survey by DNA Bengaluru ranked Jayanagar as the most liveable place in Bengaluru that still maintains the old charm of the city.

==History==
As per the Kannada language, The word &quot;Jayanagar&quot; when split into two words, Jaya and nagar literally makes it &quot;Victory City&quot;. It is not definitively known why that is. One school of thought is that &quot;Jaya&quot; comes from Mysore&#x27;s Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.

The foundation of Jayanagar was laid in the year 1948. It was one of the first planned neighbourhoods in Bengaluru, and at the time, the largest in Asia.

Jayanagar was traditionally regarded as the southern end of Bengaluru. The &quot;South End Circle&quot;, where six roads meet, and the historic Ashoka Pillar (which was to mark the southern end) bear this fact. While newer extensions have taken away this distinction from Jayanagar, it remains one of the more southern parts of the city.

In 1976, during the regime of D. Devaraj Urs, another iconic structure was added to Jayanagar, the Jayanagar BDA Shopping complex. It also housed the famous Puttanna Kanagal theatre. There was a fire in 2008. Later a new development project was initiated in 2011-2012 during the tenure of B. S. Yediyurappa and B. N. Vijaya Kumar worth around 193 crores that also involved demolishing the Puttanna Kanagal theatre.

<text>Operation Phillis was the British service-assisted evacuation operation for British citizens in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in November 2004. It was put into effect on 11 November of that year in response to the Civil war in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. A company of the Royal Gurkha Rifles was initially deployed to neighbouring Ghana, Royal Air Force transport aircraft were put on standby and HMS &quot;Albion&quot; was also directed towards the area to assist. Later troops of the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment were placed on standby to move to the area if reinforcements were needed.

On 12 November the evacuation began to proceed as two RAF Hercules and a C17 Globemaster aircraft flew evacuees to Ghana, with 120 Ghurkas escorting the evacuees from Abidjan to the airport and then forming a perimeter as the aircraft took off. 50 hours after it began the operation was complete, with 300 people evacuated including the British ambassador David Coates, and his staff. No British military or civilian casualties occurred during the operation.

<text>Prince Mihail Sturdza (24 April 1794 – 8 May 1884), sometimes anglicized as Michael Stourdza, was prince ruler of Moldavia from 1834 to 1849. He was cousin of Princess Roxandra Sturdza and Prince Alexandru Sturdza.

== Early life ==
He was born as third child and the only son of Grigore Sturdza, Lord of Cozmești, Grand Logothete (1758-1833) and his wife, Princess Maria Callimachi (1762-1822), daughter of Gregory Callimachi, reigning Prince of Moldavia. 

== Biography ==
A man of liberal education, he established in Iași, the Academia Mihăileană, the first University in Romania, a institution of higher education, and the precursor of the University of Iași. He brought scholars from foreign countries to act as teachers, and gave a very powerful stimulus to the educational development of the country. 

In 1844 he decreed the emancipation of the Gypsies, which until then had been treated as slaves and owned by the Church or by private landowners; they had been bought and sold in the open market. Mihail also attempted the secularization of monastic establishments, which was carried out by Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza in 1864, and the utilization of their endowments for national purposes. 

Mihail quelled the attempted Moldavian Revolution of 1848 without bloodshed by arresting all the few conspirators and expelling them from the country.

Mihail&#x27;s first wife was Elena Rosetti. His second wife was Princess Smaragda Vogoride, daughter of Stefan Vogoride, Prince of Samos.

He vacationed with his family annually at Baden in Germany. When his and Vogoride&#x27;s 16-year-old son was killed in Paris there in 1863, he erected a Greek Orthodox church on Michaelsberg to serve as his crypt.

<text>Mercer &quot;Merce&quot; Reynolds III (born June 17, 1945) is an American businessman. He was the finance chair of U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign.

==Education and early career==
Reynolds, born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and an M.B.A. from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. After serving briefly in the United States Army (1968–1969), he worked for Coca-Cola for ten years.

==Career==
In 1979, Reynolds and business partner William DeWitt founded the investment firm Reynolds, DeWitt &amp; Co.; he was its co-chair until 2001. Reynolds&#x27; other business ventures included Spectrum 7, an oil company which he co-chaired from 1980 to 1985 and which, in 1984 merged with the struggling firm Arbusto Energy, which was owned by George W. Bush. Reynolds was later an investor with Bush in the Texas Rangers baseball team. From 1985 to 2001, he was CEO of Reynolds Plantation, a golf community near Lake Oconee in Georgia.

Reynolds was the Ohio finance chairman for the George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign, raising over $600,000, and was named to co-chair Bush&#x27;s inaugural committee. As the national finance chair of U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2004 re-election campaign, Reynolds helped raise over $200 million for the successful effort and is sometimes credited with helping to deliver Ohio&#x27;s key electoral votes to the President. He was a frequent guest of President Bush at the White House and at Camp David and was a leading contender for the post of Commerce Secretary upon the 2004 resignation of Donald Evans. Carlos Gutierrez was ultimately selected, and served until the end of Bush&#x27;s term.

Reynolds has been active in fundraising for community and civic organizations including Summerbridge, a tutoring program for inner-city youth in Cincinnati, the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families, and United Way of America. In the field of foreign policy, he sits on the advisory board of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and has been involved with the Bridging the Rift Foundation in the Middle East.

=== Ambassadorship ===
From August 2001 to September 2003, Reynolds served as the ambassador of the United States to Switzerland and Liechtenstein, although was criticized for his lack of qualifications or prior diplomatic experience.

==Personal life==
Reynolds lives in Indian Hill, Ohio; he has five children. His deceased wife, Gabrielle Reynolds (1948-2018) was appointed by President Bush in 2004 to serve on the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Reynolds&#x27; daughter-in-law is Lindsay Reynolds, the former Chief of Staff of First Lady of the United States Melania Trump.

<doc id="1157794" wikidata="Q1157577" url="?curid=1157794" title="Daihatsu Rocky (F300)">
<text>The F300 series is a mini SUV that was manufactured by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu between 1989 and 2002. It was gradually replaced by the introduction of the Terios in 1997.


== Name ==
The &quot;Rocky&quot; nameplate is used in Japan and some American countries. In Europe and Australia, the F300 series Rocky is known as the Daihatsu Feroza, as the name &quot;Rocky&quot; was used for the larger F70 series Rugger/Fourtrak in most countries. The name &quot;Feroza&quot; is also used in Latin America and Asia. In Indonesia, the &quot;Feroza&quot; name was used instead for the petrol-engined rear-wheel drive version of the Rugger (called &quot;Taft&quot; there). The F300 series Rocky was also marketed as the Daihatsu Sportrak in the UK.

To avoid confusion, owners often refer to the models by their factory model number F300 or F310. The F310 variant, marketed as the &quot;MkII Sportrak&quot; or &quot;Feroza II&quot; featured a flared guards to accommodate a wider track than the F300 model. The F310 variant was released in 1992, before the later facelift. It had widened suspension, including differentials and rear leaf springs. The body was kept the same, except for the wider fender flares and the concealed rear wheel arches, covered by these flares. After this facelift, both the F300 and F310 variations were kept, with differing trim levels and interior design. This is most notable on the materials, colour and pattern of the seats.

== Overview ==
The Rocky is powered by a 1.6-litre &quot;HD-C&quot;/&quot;HD-E&quot; SOHC 16-valve four-cylinder petrol engine shared with the Applause. This is linked via a manual or Aisin automatic transmission, propshaft and differential to the front wheels and rear axle to provide either four-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive depending on the driver requirement. 2WD, 4WD Low and 4WD High modes are selected using a selector next to the gear stick in the cabin. Full-time 4WD with lockable inter-axle differential version were available, but without a low gear in transfer case. Power ranged between in Japan. It was available with a three-door bodystyle only, and was one of the first mini SUVs introduced by Japanese manufacturers during the 1980s. The Rocky was one of two models, alongside the Charade, to be sold in the United States during Daihatsu&#x27;s brief presence in that market.

In Europe, Latin America, Australia and most Asian markets, the F300 model was sold as the Feroza. &quot;Feroza&quot; is a made-up name, a combination of &quot;ferocious&quot; and the name &quot;Rosa&quot;. The export models were usually fitted with a detuned version of the more powerful fuel injected engine, with at 5,700 rpm. There was also a carburetted version in export trim, producing at 6,000 rpm.

The multi-point fuel-injected engine was available in Australia. The Australian Feroza II SXP variant was available in 1993 although the carburetted model was dropped from the Japanese lineup, with only the engine remaining in the lineup. The Rocky/Feroza was gradually replaced in 1998 by the J100 series Terios.

The F300 series Rocky/Feroza underwent some very minor facelifts during its production, mostly limited to different grilles with early cars having a chromed unit. The taillights were mounted in the bodywork, but some cars had blinds in these spaces and instead carried their taillights in an enlarged rear bumper. This was due to legislation introduced in some markets regarding the rear pivot door.

In 1990, an electrically-powered version called the &quot;Rocky EV&quot; was developed together with the Kansai Electric Power Company, who also purchased 26 of them. Its electrical motor could propel the Rocky up to and gave a range at a steady speed of . The four-wheel drive system remained, allowing it to climb a 21 percent slope.

== Bertone Freeclimber II ==
Italian manufacturer Bertone built a variation of the Rocky/Feroza powered by a 1.6-litre BMW &quot;M40&quot; engine, with , called the Bertone Freeclimber II. There was also a version called &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot;, after a perfume by Nicolas de Barry. The Freeclimber was popular in France and Italy in particular, as it was unaffected by the quotas imposed on Japanese imports.

<doc id="1157807" wikidata="Q165617" url="?curid=1157807" title="The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)">
<text>The Razors Edge is the twelfth studio album by Australian rock band AC/DC. Released on 24 September 1990, through Albert Productions/CBS Records International in Australasia and Atlantic Records in Europe, it was recorded in 1990 in Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn. It was a major comeback for the band, featuring the hits &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;Moneytalks&quot;. This is the only studio album to feature Welsh drummer Chris Slade, who was the drummer for AC/DC from 1989 to his dismissal in 1994.

Critical commentary for the album was generally mixed, with Alex Henderson of AllMusic complimenting Brian Johnson and Angus Young, while John Mendelsohn from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticises its similarity to the band&#x27;s past works. The album reached number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 4 on the UK Albums Chart, a smash commercial success that returned the band to a peak equivalent to that of their late 1970s and early 1980s popularity. The album earned multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the US. To support &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, the band undertook the Razors Edge World Tour, starting in November 1990.

==Background==
In 1987, the band had recorded &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; (1988) with their original producers, Harry Vanda and George Young. It was a commercial success – the album reached number 2 in the UK, and Australia. The Blow Up Your Video World Tour began in February 1988 in Perth, Australia. Following live appearances across Europe, rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young announced that he was taking time off touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, their nephew, Stevie Young, temporarily took Malcolm&#x27;s place on rhythm guitar. In 1989, drummer Simon Wright left the group to work on American heavy metal band Dio&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Lock Up the Wolves&quot; (1990); he was replaced by Welsh drummer Chris Slade. Brian Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for future albums, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through &quot;Power Up&quot; in 2020.

==Recording and composition==

&quot;The Razors Edge&quot; was recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser, produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi; and mastered by George Marino, at Sterling Sound in New York City. According to the book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, George Young was involved early on but had to bow out because of personal issues.

According to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, the opening riff to &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; features Angus Young alternating between fretted notes and playing the open string. In a 1993 interview with Alan di Perna, the guitarist recalls, &quot;I was just fiddling with my left hand when I came up with that riff; I played it more by accident than anything. I thought, &#x27;not bad,&#x27; and put it on a tape. That&#x27;s how me and Malcolm generally work. We put our ideas down on tape and play them for one another.&quot; He expanded in greater detail in the liner notes of the 2003 re-release of &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;:

&quot;Moneytalks&quot; is also one of AC/DC&#x27;s biggest hits, peaking at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 36 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 21 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. It is still the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the United States, at number 23. During their subsequent world tour, thousands of Angus Bucks – a replica of an American $1 bill but with Angus pictured instead of George Washington – were dropped on the audience during the song. A music video of the song, directed by David Mallet, was also released, featuring a live performance during the tour.

Author Murray Engleheart states in his band memoir &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;: &quot;On songs like &#x27;Mistress for Christmas&#x27; and &#x27;Moneytalks&#x27;, Malcolm and Angus showed their working-class roots, despite multi-millionaire selling albums, by taking aim at the high flyers in the business world&quot;. In a February 1991 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Angus Young stated that the funniest song from the album was &quot;Mistress for Christmas&quot;, and then said that the song was about Donald Trump. In the same interview, he declared that his best guitar solo on the album was on the title track, which also features a rare foray into finger picking.

==Release and reception==

Released on 24 September 1990, through Albert Productions/CBS Records in Australasia and Atlantic Records in Europe, &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. Alex Henderson of AllMusic complimented both the vocal performance by Brian Johnson and the guitar playing of Angus Young, and said that the album was &quot;arguably [the band&#x27;s] strongest album in over half a decade&quot;. Greg Sandow of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a very favourable review, saying that &quot;this is one album that really delivers&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff defined the album &quot;tight, highly strung and menacing... entirely worthy of its status as the grand comeback of legendary rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll runts&quot;. John Mendelsohn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, on the other hand, gave the album two out of five stars, criticising its similarity to past AC/DC works, and said that &quot;with &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, AC/DC sets a new record for the longest career without a single new idea&quot;. Mark Putterford of &quot;Select&quot; marked the album a four out of five, stating that &quot;&quot;The Razors Edge&quot; comes on like an old friend you haven&#x27;t seen for a couple of years&quot;.

The album was a major comeback for the band, featuring the singles &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; (September 1990); and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; (28 March 1991), which reached number 5 and number 16 respectively on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock chart, and &quot;Moneytalks&quot; (12 November 1990), which peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its fourth single, &quot;Rock Your Heart Out&quot; was released exclusively in Australasia on 13 October 1991. The album peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and stayed on the chart for 77 consecutive weeks. It also reached number 4 on OCC&#x27;s UK Albums Chart. &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; received certifications, including 8× Platinum in Canada, 6× Platinum in the US, 5× Platinum in Australia, 2× Platinum in Germany, and Switzerland, Platinum in Argentina, Austria, Finland, New Zealand, Spain, and Sweden, and Gold in France, Italy, and the UK. The album has sold approximately 18.8 million copies worldwide, making it the third highest selling AC/DC album after &quot;Back in Black&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot;.

To further promote &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, the band undertook a world tour starting on 2 November 1990 and ending on 16 November 1991. Several shows on the Razors Edge World Tour were recorded for the 1992 live album titled &quot;AC/DC Live&quot;. The album was produced by Fairbairn, and is considered one of the best live albums of the 1990s, according to Berry Weber of AllMusic. The album was reissued on 25 March 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series. It was also reissued on 19 November 2012 on iTunes, alongside their entire catalogue – excluding &quot;T.N.T.&quot; (1975) and the Australian versions of &quot;High Voltage&quot; (1975), &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; (1976) and &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; (1977). On 15 March 2024, the album was reissued on gold vinyl for their 50th anniversary, as part of the &quot;AC/DC 50&quot; series.

<doc id="1157810" wikidata="Q2329380" url="?curid=1157810" title="Alexandru Sturdza">
<text>Prince Alexandru Sturdza (Александр Скарлатович Стурдза; Iași, Moldavia, 18 November 1791Odessa, 13 June 1854) was a Russian publicist and diplomat of Romanian origin. In his writings, he referred to himself with a French rendition of his name, Alexandre Stourdza.

==Early life==
Alexandru Sturdza was a member of the House of Sturdza, born in Jassy, in Moldavia, as son of Scarlat Sturdza, Governor of Bessarabia and Princess Ekaterina Mourousis, daughter of Constantine Mourouzis, Prince of Moldavia. Through his mother he was related to all Greek Phanariote families. Alexandru Sturdza was brother of Roxandra Edling-Sturdza and a cousin of Mihail Sturdza, Prince of Moldavia from 1834 to 1849. After his family fled Bessarabia in 1802 in order to avoid the repression from the Ottomans, he was educated in Germany and Russia.

==Later life==
He entered the Russian diplomatic service in 1809 and acted as secretary of Ioannis Kapodistrias during the Congress of Vienna. Under this capacity, he drafted the first version of the treaty of the Holy Alliance, from the penciled notes of the Czar Alexander I. Because of his Greek origins and his friendship with Ioannis Kapodistrias, he was a strong supporter of Philhellenism before and during the Greek War of Independence. Together with his sister Roxandra he sponsored philanthropic activities to help Greek war refugees. He retired in Odessa in 1830, where he devoted himself to his literary works.

==Personal life==
In 1819 he settled at Dresden and married Elisabeth Hufeland, daughter of German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. They had one son and two daughters:

* Prince Ionita Sandu Sturdza (b. 1820)
* Princess Maria Sturdza (1821-1890) married Prince Eugen Gagarin and was progenitor of House of Gagarin-Sturdza.
* Princess Olga Sturdza (d. 1895) married Prince Mikhail Aleksandrovich Obolensky (1821-1886)

==Works==
Striving to develop a renovated form of Orthodox Christianity and to promote it in Western Europe, he wrote &quot;Considérations sur la doctrine et l&#x27;esprit de l&#x27;Église orthodoxe&quot; (Stuttgart, 1816).

His &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;état actuel de l&#x27;Allemagne&quot;, written at the request of Tsar Alexander I during the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, was an attack on the German universities, repeated in &quot;Coup d&#x27;oeil sur les universites de l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; (Aachen, 1818). It aroused great indignation in Germany, which indignation has been attributed to the levity with which its author arraigned the German national character and branded the universities as hotbeds of the revolutionary spirit and atheism. His other important works are &quot;La Grèce&quot; in 1821 (Leipzig, 1822) and &quot;Oeuvres posthumes religieuses, historiques, philosophiques et litteraires&quot; (5 vols., Paris, 1858–1861).

<text>Bernard Rollen Williams III (born January 19, 1978) is an American male former track and field sprinter and winner of a gold medal in 4 × 100-meter relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was the 200-meter dash silver medalist at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 100-meter dash silver medalist at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics. He also won relay gold at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and was the 100 m gold medalist at the 1999 Pan American Games.

He has broken the 10-second barrier and holds a personal record of 9.94 seconds in the 100 m. Williams was the fastest man in the 200 m at the 2003 season with a personal record of 20.01 seconds. He won the American national title in the 100 m at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 2001 and 2003. He competed collegiately for the Florida Gators and was NCAA Outdoor champion in the 100 m and 4 × 100 m relay in 2000.

==Biography==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Bernard Williams won the 100 meters at the 1999 Pan American Games.

Williams accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he was a member of the Florida Gators track and field team. He graduated from the university with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology in 2008.

In 2000, Williams won the NCAA Championships in the 100 meters and 4 × 100 m relay as a Florida Gator sprinter. He ran the second leg on the gold medal-winning American 4 × 100 m relay team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The teams extravagant celebrations drew criticism at the time. Acquiring the nickname &quot;Hollywood&quot;, he was personally noted for his comedy antics during the 2000 Olympics, including using &quot;the people&#x27;s eyebrow&quot; – a pose used by then-professional wrestler Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson. Also, known for his pre race antics and poses playing to any crowd, which grew to be increasingly accepted in the sport following the celebrations of multiple Olympic champion Usain Bolt.

At the 2001 World Championships, Williams finished third but was given the silver medal for the 100 meters when (Tim Montgomery) was discovered to have used steroids. Williams also ran the second leg on the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won the gold medal. The team&#x27;s gold medals were withdrawn when Tim Montgomery was discovered to have used steroids. Williams was upgraded to 100 m national champion as a result of this disqualification, however.

In 2003, Williams won the US National Championships in 100 meters and was fifth in 100 meters at the 2003 World Championships. He was also a member of gold medal-winning American relay team. He tested positive for cannabis and received a warning from the USADA in August 2004, but was still able to compete in the Olympics in accordance with IAAF rules.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Williams won the silver medal in 200 meters, edging compatriot and 100 meters champion Justin Gatlin in the final few meters. Thus, Americans won all three top places, since Shawn Crawford won the gold. The Americans performed to a booing audience, as the Greeks protested the exclusion of the 2000 Olympic champion Kostas Kenteris for doping.

Bernard works as a Sports Performance Coach in the Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia area.

<text>The Gulf of Venezuela is a gulf of the Caribbean Sea bounded by the Venezuelan states of Zulia and Falcón and by La Guajira Department, Colombia. The western side is formed by the Guajira Peninsula. A strait connects it with Maracaibo Lake to the south.

==Location==
The Gulf is located in the north of South America, between Paraguaná Peninsula of the Falcón State to the east in Venezuela and Guajira Peninsula in Colombia to the west. It is connected to the south to Maracaibo Lake through an artificial navigation canal. Colombia and Venezuela have had a longstanding dispute over control of the gulf that has not been resolved, despite the decades-long negotiations conducted by a bilateral commission.

==History==

The gulf was first seen by Europeans in 1499, when an expedition commanded by Alonso de Ojeda, in which he was accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci, explored the Venezuelan coasts. They compiled information and named the new lands; this expedition arrived at the gulf after passing through the Netherlands Antilles and the Peninsula of Paraguaná.

==Economic importance==
These waters are important because they connect the Caribbean Sea to Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, an important source of crude petroleum. Their industry uses the gulf to ship products from their wells and refineries in Lake Maracaibo to the world markets.

<doc id="1157815" wikidata="Q1612226" url="?curid=1157815" title="Broughton, Lincolnshire">
<text>Broughton is a town and civil parish situated on the Roman Ermine Street, in the North Lincolnshire district of Lincolnshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 5,726. In 2021, the population was 5,434. It is situated approximately north-west from the town of Brigg. The hamlets of Wressle, Castlethorpe, and part of Scawby Brook lie within the parish boundaries.

A settlement existed at Broughton in the Neolithic Stone Age (New Stone Age). Stone tools have been found particularly on the commons near Wressle. Pottery was discovered at a house on Ermine Street in 1956, thought to date back to the Bronze Age period. There were burials discovered around 1850 in the commons to the north-east of Broughton.

Broughton&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Church is a Grade I listed building, with a very rare Saxon staircase tower, one of four in the country. The others are at Brixworth, Brigstock and Hough-on-the-Hill. The church is thought to date to the 11th century with major alterations in the 12th, 14th and 17th centuries. Gokewell Priory was founded nearby in the late 12th century to house a community of nuns.

The Baronetcy of Broughton was created 11 December 1660 for Sir Edmund Anderson, 1st Baronet, and became extinct on the death of Sir Charles Henry John Anderson, 9th Baronet, on 8 October 1891.

To the west and north, Broughton has extensive woodlands that stretch toward Dragonby, Scunthorpe and Appleby. The south of the woods sits one of the few 4-star hotels in the area, and which has a 27-hole golf course (formerly Forest Pines, now Doubletree by Hilton – though still commonly known as Forest Pines).

Though considered by many to be a village, it became a town in 1974, although it still has a village hall. At the 2011 census, the size of Broughton parish was slightly larger than its neighbour Brigg, due to housing developments at the edge of the parish in Scawby Brook.

<text>Grigore Mihail Sturdza, first name also Grigorie or Grigori, last name also Sturza, Stourdza, Sturd̦a, and Stourza (also known as Muklis Pasha, George Mukhlis, and Beizadea Vițel; May 11, 1821 – January 26, 1901), was a Moldavian, later Romanian soldier, politician, and adventurer. He was the son of Prince Mihail Sturdza, a scion of ancient boyardom, and, during the 1840s, an heir apparent to the Moldavian throne, for which he was known throughout his later life as Moldavia&#x27;s &quot;Beizadea&quot; (junior prince). A rebellious youth famous for his feats of strength, he set up his own private militia which he used to corner the Moldavian grain trade, and entered a legal battle with Sardinian retailers. In 1845, he defied his father, and French law, by seeking to marry the much older, already married Countess Dash, and barricaded himself with her at Perieni. By 1847, Grigore had been reintegrated into the Moldavian establishment, and, as a general in the Moldavian princely militia, personally handled repression during the attempted revolution of April 1848. During these events, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; became personal enemies with three future statesmen—Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Mihail Kogălniceanu, and Manolache Costache Epureanu.

Following Mihail Sturdza&#x27;s ouster in 1849, Grigore joined the Ottoman army as a Colonel, and took part in the Crimean War, serving under Michał Czajkowski and Omar Pasha. A mounted sniper noted for his feats of extreme courage, he was advanced to Brigadier General. A plan, discussed by Czajkowski, had Sturdza placed in a command position for an offensive into Southern Bessarabia; this never materialized, though Sturdza served on the commission which awarded that region back to Moldavia, upon the end of the war. Grigore and Mihail Sturdza competed with each other for the princely election of 1858, with their rivalry playing a major part in the victory of a third candidate, Cuza. During the formation of the United Principalities in 1859–1864, Sturdza maintained conservative principles as a member of the Central Commission, thereafter alternating between loyal opposition in the Romanian Assembly of Deputies and anti-Cuza conspiracy, while being in particular adverse to Cuza&#x27;s projected land reform. Himself a claimant to either the throne of a secessionist Moldavia or that of Romanian &quot;Domnitor&quot;, he participated in the &quot;monstrous coalition&quot; which managed to depose Cuza in early 1866.

With the arrival of Carol I as &quot;Domnitor&quot;, Sturdza became leader of the &quot;White&quot; conservatives in Iași, also taking up the cause of regionalism; he stirred national controversy by circulating an extreme conservative manifesto known as &quot;Petition of Iași&quot;. His views on international politics eventually brought him into a dispute with the moderate conservatives at &quot;Junimea&quot;. Shunning &quot;Junimist&quot; Germanophilia, Sturdza became a committed Russophile during the Romanian War of Independence, forming his own group, the National-Democratic Party. This faction broke apart after its members were questioned regarding an assassination attempt on Prime Minister Ion Brătianu; eventually, Sturdza himself was recruited by Brătianu&#x27;s National Liberal Party in the 1890s. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; was by then dedicated mostly to his non-political work, including attempts to establish his profile as a composer, philosopher, inventor, and art sponsor; his last activities included raising a Sturdza Palace in Bucharest. He was also absorbed and financially exhausted by a long trial involving his family inheritance. Known for his sexual promiscuity and his fathering of illegitimate children, he left a diminished estate that was itself disputed among his progeny.

==Biography==
===Origins and childhood===
As reported by scholar Moses Gaster, Grigore&#x27;s family, the Sturdzas, were &quot;long and intimately associated with the government first of Moldavia and afterwards of Rumania.&quot; Their origin, Gaster speculates, was in the Empire of Trebizond, whence they settled Moldavia and Wallachia during the 17th century. Other sources indicate that the first known Sturdza actually lived in Moldavia during the mid-16th-century reigns of Alexandru Lăpușneanu; he was of plausible, but unconfirmed, Aromanian origin. The &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s grandfather, &quot;Logothete&quot; Grigorașcu Sturdza, enshrined a legend according to which the family was a branch of the Hungarian Thurzós, and that it ultimately had Dalmatian origins. Reportedly, Grigore did not favor this claim, but instead regarded himself as a descendant of Vlad the Impaler. His contemporary, the genealogist and polemicist Constantin Sion, lists the Sturdzas as native Moldavians from Putna County.

In her 1901 obituary for the &quot;Société astronomique de France&quot;, Dorothea Klumpke noted that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was a native of &quot;Scutarie&quot; village in Russia&#x27;s Bessarabia Governorate (formerly a part of Moldavia), and gives his birth date as May 11, 1821. An 1849 letter sent by Sturdza clarifies the date as Julian, which remained in use in Moldavia and Romania throughout his life, and which corresponds to May 23. It also explains that the Bessarabian locality was in fact Sculeni, his family having fled there from the ravages of the Greek Revolution in Moldavia; as a baby, he lived in Bessarabia, then in Bukovina, Austrian Empire. Other obituaries and biographies suggest that Sturdza was born at Iași, the Moldavian capital city. Grigore&#x27;s parents were Mihail and his first wife, Elisabeta &quot;Săftica&quot; Paladi, who descended from the Rosetti family. Her relative, the politician-historian Radu Rosetti, claims that the marriage was forced, noting that Mihail was &quot;ugly-faced, ruddy-haired, short in stature, bowlegged [and] surly&quot;. Through Săftica and through his paternal grandmother Maria (a Callimachi), Grigore was partly Greek; his great-grandfather was a Phanariote, Gregory Callimachi, who served as Moldavian Prince in the 1760s.

By 1820, both countries were beginning their emancipation from Ottoman vassalage. A relative, Ioan &quot;Ioniță&quot; Sturdza, was being recognized by the Sublime Porte as the reigning Prince of Moldavia, putting an end to a century of Phanariote reigns. Unusually, he met most opposition from the &quot;seven pillars of Moldavia, all of them great boyars&quot;—a group which included Grigorașcu Sturdza. In February 1823, Grigorașcu and Maria&#x27;s son Mihail was the first Moldavian to call himself a man of &quot;conservative principles&quot;. The Sturdza ascendancy was interrupted by the Russo-Turkish War of 1828, during which Prince Ioan was captured by the Imperial Russian Army. The war ended with an increase of Russian influence over Wallachia and Moldavia, codified into the constitutional act, &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot;. In April 1834, Mihail was selected for the Moldavian throne, beginning a reign which lasted to June 1849; during that interval, Grigore was to be referred to as &quot;Beizadea&quot;—an informal title bestowed upon sons of the &quot;Hospodar&quot;. However, his mother was no longer included in the princely family: in order to gain the trust of Ottoman Foreign Minister Mustafa Reşid Pasha, Mihail divorced Săftica and married Stefan Bogoridi&#x27;s daughter, Smaranda. From this marriage, Grigore had two stepbrothers, both named Mihail—the first one died in 1846, the second one, born in 1848, only survived to 1863; a stepsister, Maria (1848–1905), went on to marry Konstantin Aleksandrovich, son of the Russian statesman Alexander Gorchakov.

===Training===
Grigore began service in the Moldavian princely militia in August 1834, when he became a cavalry cadet. He was much impressed by the experience, which shaped his lifelong belief in militarism. Around coronation time, he and his elder brother Dimitrie were being tutored at Miroslava school by a Professor Victor de Lincourt. In September 1834, their father sent them to study in the Kingdom of France—alongside Mihail Kogălniceanu and other young boyars, and with Lincourt as a chaperon, they were assigned to a school in Lunéville. This path mirrored Mihail&#x27;s own schooling and, in addition, was selected in order to prevent Grigore and Dimitrie from being educated in Russia. It was also designed to avoid Paris, which was the center of radical politics ever since the July Revolution: &quot;youth from good families [had] to learn French, the language of diplomacy, and receive a good instruction, were carefully kept out of any contact with the liberal or revolutionary spirit.&quot; The news was finally communicated to the Russian Emperor, Nicholas I, who was indignant that his subordinate&#x27;s sons were being educated in liberal France, and pondered having Sturdza dethroned. Another factor which made stay in France unlikely was an illegal duel, in which Grigore wounded his colleague Lippmann.

In August 1835 the two boys were relocated to the French Gymnasium in the Prussian capital, Berlin. In addition to the regular schedule, they were given lessons in legal history, and applied their new-found knowledge to the study of Moldavian law. Grigore earned top marks for his academic interests, but also for his courageous and passionate character; he and Dimitrie graduated together, enlisting at Berlin University in October 1837. Grigore was supposed to take lectures in natural law from Eduard Gans, but the latter died before he could enlist. He eventually studied political economy under Adolph Riedel, and technology with Heinrich Gustav Magnus, renouncing all legal study in April 1840; according to various records, he took history with Leopold von Ranke and was introduced to natural sciences by Alexander von Humboldt and Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. In a sarcastic note, Gérard de Nerval referred to Sturdza as having &quot;more studied than understood Hegel&#x27;s philosophy&quot;.

The &quot;Beizadea&quot; spent three more years in Berlin. Biographers speculate that he probably attended a Prussian military school, though it remains more clearly attested that Grigore was being privately tutored by an artillery officer of the &quot;Gardekorps&quot;. Both brothers took legal courses at home, focusing especially on Byzantine law. This was meant to serve them in their mission of modernizing Moldavia&#x27;s courts. In 1838, they had been advanced to Lieutenants in the militia and had acquired junior position on Mihail&#x27;s privy council; at some point before 1848, &quot;without ever having served in the Russian army, [they] received from Emperor Nicholas the rank of &quot;Polkovnik&quot; (Colonel).&quot; This was possibly an honor requested by their father.

Grigore was already unusually tall, a trait that he inherited from his Rosetti mother, and had been born with &quot;outstanding muscular strength&quot;. An 1838 letter by Prince Sturdza&#x27;s secretary, Charles Tissot, notes that Grigore was becoming a bodybuilder: &quot;He excels in all manner of exercises and displays outstanding physical force. This strength shows up in everything he undertakes.&quot; Various accounts make note of his unusual exercise routine, which included transporting a calf on his shoulders—which gave rise to his affectionate or derisive moniker, &quot;Beizadea Vițel&quot; (&quot;&quot;Beizadea&quot; [of the] Calf&quot;). Rumors rendered by Nerval suggest that by 1844 he could also lift a grown man on just one arm, as well as, on both arms, a barbell weighing some 1,100 metric pounds (550 kilograms). Radu Rosetti, who befriended the &quot;Beizadea&quot; when the latter was aged over fifty, recalls that he still pursued his physical routine, which now included grip strength exercises, and that he would often perform them in the semi-nude. Writer George Costescu similarly notes that, in maturity, Grigore Sturdza was an avid and tireless swimmer, especially fond of the waters outside Agigea; in winter, he enjoyed wrestling matches with a good friend, George San-Marin.

===Countess Dash affair===
Nikolay Girs, who served in 1841 as &quot;Dragoman&quot; for the Russian Consulate in Iași, describes Dimitrie as a &quot;gentle and harmless young fella&quot; who dedicated himself to training horses. By contrast, Grigore was a man of &quot;boundless pride&quot;, who &quot;inspired fear on all people, including to his authoritarian father&quot;. This judgement was partly replicated by the Austrian agent Stokera, who found the elder Sturdza sibling to be &quot;rather poor with the spirit&quot;, also arguing that, at this stage, Grigore was committed to Moldavia&#x27;s &quot;Russian party&quot;. Despite his lack of seniority, Grigore was being groomed to succeed Mihail on the princely throne. Reportedly, he asked his father to allow him a relocation to Paris, which he found to be warmer and more intellectually prestigious, as well as more sexually liberated, than Berlin. Reportedly, in 1839 the future &quot;Muklis&quot; had also joined the Turkish Freemasonry, and, with his personal example, helped spark recruitment into the less developed Moldavian Freemasonry; according to literary historian Radu Cernătescu, this activity was satirized by Vasile Alecsandri in his 1840 play, &quot;Farmazonul din Hârlău&quot; (&quot;The Freemason of Hârlău&quot;), with &quot;Beizadea&quot; reflected in its main character, &quot;Pestriț&quot; (&quot;Mottled&quot;).

Sturdza abandoned his studies in Berlin in February 1843, without getting his diploma. With Russian acquiescence, he finally moved to Paris later that year, and was tasked with continuing his legal studies. Upon relocation, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; became an honored guest of literary salons. It was in Paris that he began an affair with a female novelist, Gabrielle Anne &quot;Countess Dash&quot;, who was 18 years his senior and married. One version of the story is that young Sturdza obtained from her a pledge that she would marry him and follow him to Moldavia. Other accounts claim that his father was informed of his matrimonial intentions, and recalled him to Iași before a wedding could take place. &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore returned to Moldavia in 1844. During March of the next year, his father appointed him as junior caretaker of the Moldavian schools, assigning him the task of supervising education reform and prevent egalitarian ideas from seeping in; Grigore never showed up to be sworn in. At the time, Dimitrie had been successfully recruited into the administration, serving as &quot;Hatman&quot; (commander general) of the princely militia. As reported by Girs, Prince Mihail allowed his other son a &quot;ministry of his choice&quot;, but Grigore left immediately, &quot;dissatisfied with the stipend that his father would allow him.&quot; Instead, he &quot;decided to get rich quick&quot; by combining investments in leasehold estates with a protection racket. Acting as a &quot;feudal lord, under laws of his own creation&quot;, he also established a private army of Arnauts, threatening with physical harm all those who would oppose him, including judges. After a celebratory visit to Neamț Monastery, Grigore asked to be allowed an extended vacation on his father&#x27;s estate of Perieni. In early 1845, he was joined there by Gabrielle Anne, having informed his father that they were to be married; Mihail advised him to wait.
Grigore feared that this was an attempt at stalling. As reported by writer Constantin Negruzzi, who was a personal witness to the events, he held the Perieni priest at gunpoint, forcing him to perform a ceremony in his father&#x27;s absence, and without his approval. Dash had been formally baptized into Eastern Orthodoxy (the Moldavian Metropolitan Church), taking the name of &quot;Diana&quot;. Her baptism and wedding were reported to the Moldavian Metropolis, which proceeded to nullify the latter act, effective on May 9, and informed the Price of his son&#x27;s doings. The national scandal which erupted turned international, once it became apparent that Countess Dash was a bigamist under French law. The French consul, François Duclos, stepped in to persuade the couple that the marriage was not legal, but found himself confronted by the &quot;Beizadea&quot;, and unable to answer the Countess&#x27; observation that she was no longer a French national, nor a Catholic. In June 1845, French Prime Minister François Guizot personally weighed in, informing Gabrielle of the risks she was taking upon herself. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; replied for her, telling Duclos: &quot;It astonishes me so very much, Sir, that Mr Guizot should take such an interest in my love life. He would be well advised to handle his own ministry, which he has been handling very poorly.&quot; Presented with another scenario, namely that his brother&#x27;s militia could storm into Perieni and arrest him, Grigore announced that he and &quot;my sharecroppers&quot; would fight to their deaths. He continued to defy his father by taking hold of the estate revenues of Perieni and Neamț Monastery.

The Prince retaliated by ordering his military not to allow Grigore into Iași, and Moldavian boyars to stay out of Perieni. Memoirist Gheorghe Sion reports that eventually, in September 1845, 200 Uhlans, forming Moldavia&#x27;s full cavalry force, rode into Perieni. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; barricaded himself inside the princely compound, where he expected to withstand the siege alongside a group of trusted Arnauts. Lacking provisions and deserted by his servants, he rode out of Perieni &quot;on his wildest steed&quot;, armed with a carbine, a sword, and four pistols. The Uhlans never chased after him, focusing instead on disarming the Arnauts; they also arrested Countess Dash and escorted her to Mamornița, forcing her to cross into Austrian Galicia, never to return. Duclos provides a different narrative, according to which the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had simply grown tired of the Countess, and had her sign a &quot;convention&quot; ending the marriage; in both his and G. Sion&#x27;s version, the conflict ends with Grigore asking for the Prince&#x27;s forgiveness. Yet another account is that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had been made aware that the Countess was having an affair with her cousin, the Count Tanneberg, and that he personally escorted both of them to Switzerland in November 1845. A notice originally published in &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&quot; that December noted that Sturdza and Dash had &quot;dissolved their marriage by mutual agreement&quot;, and that he was set to marry one of Ivan Paskevich&#x27;s daughters.

In 1846, Dash and her cousin were living in Como at the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s expense. The latter was still flaunting sexual mores with his escapades, and, as recorded by his father&#x27;s secretary Nicolae Șuțu, had to undergo specialized treatment for his venereal diseases. He had returned to his activities in agriculture, employing agronomist Alecu Kulici and Ion Ionescu de la Brad on the land he leased in Săbăoani, and giving them access to &quot;the secrets of all lucrative speculation in both Principalities.&quot; C. Sion reports that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; now had a criminal gang made up of young boyar upstarts such as Dumitrache Stan (allegedly a Wallachian Rom), Costache Roată, Dumitrache Stat, and the forger Petrache Kozmiță. During 1847, a commission formed by the &quot;Beizadea&quot;, alongside boyars Strat and Stan, was tasked with investigating the timber trade of Dorna-Arini, Suceava County. They found that the yeomanry was being exploited by a cartel of foreign merchants, including Greeks, Turks and Jews, and wrote off much of the village debt.

===1848 Revolution===
Despite such acts of generosity, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was mostly known for his outstanding cruelty. Writer I. C. Severeanu reports that Sturdza not only kept Romani slaves, but actually shot and killed one of them for oversalting his soup. Sion describes the young Sturdza, &quot;that famous thief&quot;, as &quot;heartless, cruel, unmerciful, and so very wolfish&quot;. As Ionescu reported, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had a plan of taking in his care &quot;all the estates of Roman County&quot;, to emerge as the &quot;elephant&quot; of Moldavian agriculture. Sturdza also began holding land to his own name: at Cristești, he used, and sometimes lived in, a giant durmast oak with a view of the Ceahlău Massif.

At the time, Sturdza also became interested in projects of sea and river commercial navigation. At some point in the 1840s, he helped document the history of shipping by procuring an engraving showing 15th-century Moldavian sailboats, which survived in a reproduction by Gheorghe Asachi. By December 1847, Sturdza had become a supplier for the European grain trade, in lucrative relations with firms and employees from the Kingdom of Sardinia. Initially, he tried to undercut the markets of Galați by acquiring his own merchantmen—two brigantines, manned by Sardinians. He then worked with specialized retailers from the Pedemonte House, but failed to honor his obligations, and was taken to court. The incident became an international scandal after Moldavian courts ruled that Sturdza was owed reparations and legal fees by Pedemonte.

As noted by genealogist Mihai Dim. Sturdza, it remains an issue of contention among his colleagues whether Sturdza was ever legally married to Countess Dash. Sturdza&#x27;s second marriage, reportedly arranged by his father, was to the Wallachian Olga Ghica. By most accounts, she was the daughter of the Wallachian intellectual Mihalache Ghica, making Grigore a brother-in-law of writer Dora d&#x27;Istria. However, as reported by Girs, Wallachians were generally aware that Olga was the natural daughter of former Governor Pavel Kiselyov, and a Ghica only by adoption. The couple were wed in Bucharest, the Wallachian capital city, on March 1, 1848. Sturdza&#x27;s first wife was reportedly devastated by these developments—in a letter to her, the Viscount d&#x27;Arlincourt presented his sympathies for her loss, and encouraged her to keep writing as a remedy. She reflected on her relationship with Sturdza in her 1848 novel, &quot;Michaël le Moldave&quot;. Here, he appears as &quot;Michaël Cantémir&quot;, while Dash herself is the ethnic Romani maid Chiva; historical facts are modified to suggest that Sturdza had been forced to choose between his passion and the needs of his countrymen, since marrying Chiva would have made him ineligible for the throne. The novel was translated into Romanian by Theodor Codrescu and already published in that version in 1851.

All Sturdzas were involved in quelling the attempted revolution of April 1848. Dimitrie was nominally in charge, as &quot;Hatman&quot;, but, as recounted by Radu Rosetti, Grigore, being &quot;more energetic and competent&quot;, personally supervised the revolutionaries&#x27; arrest and mistreatment. Dressed as a Russian &quot;Polkovnik&quot;, he was the subject of a derisive remark by one of his victims, Alecu Rosetti: &quot;Vous êtes magnifique et pas cher!&quot; (&quot;You are quite magnificent and not at all expensive!&quot;). The same is noted by diplomat N. B. Cantacuzène (son of the revolutionary figure Vasile Canta). He writes that &quot;Grégoire Sturdza, son of the Prince&quot; masterminded the ambush of Colonel Alexandru Ioan Cuza and other regime critics inside Iași&#x27;s Casimir House. Other reports suggest that Grigore ordered his troops to shoot all prisoners, but that his order was vetoed by his brother the &quot;Hatman&quot;. Grigore is believed to have similarly handled the arrest of another young revolutionary, Manolache Costache Epureanu; Kogălniceanu had also joined the revolutionary movement, but escaped into exile. He reportedly maintained an &quot;overt and implacable dislike&quot; for the &quot;Beizadea&quot; and, before his departure, accused him of having defrauded Neamț Monastery of &quot;no less than forty thousand ducats&quot;. In May, Alecsandri also referred to Grigore in a revolutionary manifesto, describing the &quot;tyrannical tortures&quot; of peasants on his leased estates. Alecsandri also claimed that Sturdza&#x27;s Arnauts had ransacked boyar homes, stolen precious clocks owned by Georgios Kantakouzinos, and mistreatead prisoners.

Overall, Prince Mihail sought to maintain a political course that would allow reform without resulting in a Russian punitive invasion. He was himself expelled from the country due to a Russian veto, which some, including Stokera, believed was possibly prompted by Grigore&#x27;s &quot;bad behavior&quot;. In 1849 he was living at the Bogoridis&#x27; &quot;hôtel particulier&quot; in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. Around that time, Dimitrie signaled his definitive retirement from public life, settling in Dieppe. He had married a distant relative, Catrina Sturdza, with whom he established a family branch in France. An absentee landlord over large estates in Moldavia, he relied on the Jewish entrepreneur Mochi Fischer to handle his affairs, a matter which contributed to peasant strife over the next 60 years. Grigore&#x27;s own lease on the village of Borca, part of the Slatina Monastery lands, was highly controversial after Moldavian Poles, who acted as his proxies, pushed locals into debt servitude. Immediately after his father&#x27;s ouster, the peasants stopped making payments and issued formal complains. The matter was investigated by Lascăr Catargiu, at the time the civil inspector (&quot;Ispravnic&quot;), who found that Sturdza had indeed disregarded law and custom.

===Crimean War===

By the time of the revolution, &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore had focused on his military career, and held a general&#x27;s rank in the Moldavian militia. Building on his personal friendship with Reşid Pasha at the peak of &quot;Tanzimat&quot; reforms, he transferred to a Colonel&#x27;s posting in the Ottoman army in 1852. As &quot;Muklis Pasha&quot; (also &quot;Muhlis Basha&quot; and other variants), Sturdza was assigned to the Turkish Cossack cavalry in December 1853, some two months into the Crimean War. This unit was also set up to include Wallachian revolutionary deportees, to whom the Porte had granted partial amnesty. Sturdza fought with distinction in Wallachia, beginning with the Battle of Oltenița; he was then involved in the engagements at Cetate, displaying &quot;rather insane courage&quot; as a mounted sniper, who took aim at enemy officers while fired upon by the Russian artillery. He also ignored his superiors&#x27; orders and, in August 1854, made a trip to Russian-abandoned Bucharest, where he found his wife&#x27;s home &quot;almost spared of bullets and robbers.&quot;

During Sturdza&#x27;s service under the Ottoman flag, Moldavia had come under Russian occupation. The country&#x27;s Finance Ministry defined Sturdza as an enemy combatant, and moved to confiscate his entire personal wealth—comprising Cristești and Cozmești, which were then sold at auction. In his later career, Sturdza lamented the Principalities&#x27; failure to involved themselves on the anti-Russian side, arguing that they missed out on an opportunity that was seized upon by Sardinia. He viewed the conflict as essential in effecting Italian unification, and proposed that a more visible Romanian engagement could have similarly resulted in Moldo-Wallachian unification. Among the revolutionaries, Golescu-Negru viewed Sturdza&#x27;s presence in Ottoman ranks as indicative that the Porte was favoring conservatives; his cousin Golescu-Albu similarly referred to Sturdza as a &quot;bad memory&quot;, also suggesting that he had hampered his group&#x27;s attempts at propaganda in Europe.

Sturdza networked with the pro-Ottoman Wallachian Ion Ghica, but the two split in February 1854. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; reportedly preferred to associate with the better positioned Ion Heliade Rădulescu. Around June of that year, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had permanent contact with other Wallachians, including Gheorghe Magheru—who knew him as &quot;Pașoalca&quot; (&quot;The Little Pasha&quot;). Reportedly, he tried to intrude in revolutionary affairs, warning Magheru that Ion Ghica was a Russian spy. Also exiled for his participation in the Moldavian attempt, Ionescu de la Brad informed Ghica that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was a libeler. Ghica himself had fond recollections of partying with Sturdza in Istanbul. His letters refer to &quot;Pașoalca&quot;″s birthday, which doubled as a celebration of Romanian nationalism: they &quot;listened with our ears and our souls&quot; to a performance by the &quot;Lăutari&quot;.

On the Wallachian front, Sturdza served under Michał Czajkowski, an Ottoman Cossack general and, originally, a member of the Polish revolutionary diaspora. Czajkowski hoped that the war would continue in Bessarabia, and viewed the Moldavian Sturdza as an asset in that scenario, recommending him to serve on the Ottoman General Staff. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; was forced to resign soon after, for unknown reasons—Czajkowski&#x27;s correspondence suggests that he was under investigation for unknown reasons: &quot;I was summoned to give in writing where I got to know [Sturdza], who I recommended him to, how he behaved, how he was treated and everything I know about him.&quot; Sturdza himself was having &quot;very spirited altercations&quot; with Omar Pasha, and once prepared for a military standoff by having his own tent converted into an arsenal. This resulted in his replacement with Sefer Pasha. Sturdza was then reassigned to a section of the Danube army, under Halim Pasha. In early 1855, he was moved to the main front, seeing action at Eupatoria and finding himself advanced to the equivalent of a Brigadier General; he was also &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Omar Pasha. A lithograph by Gustav Bartsch and Johann Hesse honors his profile as a warrior, showing him (under the name &quot;Mouhlis Pacha&quot;) standing near Sultan Abdulmejid I, who is riding a steed.

The Russians withdrew from Moldavia in 1854, leaving the Austrians to administer both Principalities as a buffer zone. The following year, an Austrian spy known as &quot;Flavius&quot; expressed concern about the growth of support for Sturdza in Wallachia, and claimed that he was being prepped to take over as Wallachian Prince. In May 1856, &quot;Muklis&quot; joined the Ottoman diplomatic mission tasked with implementing the Treaty of Paris in respect to Southern Bessarabia (which had been returned to Moldavia). Russia&#x27;s envoy Michel Fanton de Verrayon protested against this appointment, since Sturdza was a Moldavian national, arguing that he could not be impartial on the territorial issue; the Porte stood by Sturdza. The Commission president, Charles George Gordon, was much displeased with Sturdza&#x27;s arrival, noting that he was being quarrelsome and created additional hurdles in settling the border disputes. 

In his diplomatic capacity, Sturdza protested against the evacuation of Danubian Cossacks and their property from Bessarabian localities. He also boasted, to an incredulous audience, that he had personally obtained more territory for Moldavia in Bolgrad County. Sturdza himself returned to his native country and was reconciled with the new Prince, Grigore Alexandru Ghica. Under this regime, he finally renounced his claim to the Pedemonte reparations (September 1856). The Russian side had repeatedly refused to deal with Sturdza as a commission member, noting that he was a deserter from their ranks. Kogălniceanu welcomed the news, seeing them as proof that Russians had a good understanding of Sturdza&#x27;s character: &quot;this man will also desert from the Turkish colors, as he has done first with the Moldavian colors, and then with the Russian colors.&quot;

===1858–1859 election===

Samples of diplomatic correspondence indicate that, in July 1856, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had real chances of being appointed &quot;Caimacam&quot; (regent) of Moldavia, losing only narrowly to Teodor Balș, himself replaced in February 1857 by Bogoridi&#x27;s son, Nicolae Vogoride. In April 1857, at Iași, Sturdza handed the final act on Moldavia&#x27;s frontier to Vogoride. The waning of Russian influence now allowed room for the National Party, which supported a political unification of Moldavia and Wallachia, and their emancipation as an independent country. In 1855, this group opened a Masonic Lodge in Iași, which, by 1857, was secretly debating candidacies for the Moldavian throne. Grigore Sturdza&#x27;s support by the great boyar families was seen as an obstacle by the Nationals, who regarded him as a &quot;Phanariote&quot;; while the group was adamant that they would never support Sturdza, they remained for a while divided between putting up Alecsandri and Costache Negri as their rival candidates.

Arriving into the country dressed as a Pasha, Sturdza Jr presented himself as an alternative to both his father&#x27;s &quot;retrograde party&quot; and the &quot;ultra-radical democracy&quot; of National activists. His political reference, by that moment, was Bonapartism, with Sturdza appearing as a Moldavian version of Napoleon III; he promised unification with Wallachia, but only within the very loose norms stipulated under the Treaty of Paris. In April 1858, &quot;Muklis&quot; finally announced his candidacy for the Moldavian throne in the election of December. There were initially eight candidates, including himself and his father; Grigore was entered into the race by Anastasie Panu, who was serving as one of the three &quot;Caimacams&quot; who had taken over from Vogoride. In November, the &quot;Journal de Constantinople&quot; retrospectively noted: &quot;Mouhlis-Pacha (Prince Grégoire Stourdza), one of the more fidgety candidates, who thought that he had quite a few chances, has lost them all following the arrival of his father&quot;. A retrospective note in Louis Debrauz&#x27;s &quot;Mémorial Diplomatique&quot; suggests that Sturdza Jr had left Moldavians with &quot;too many irritating and upsetting memories&quot;. As part of his effort to persuade the public, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; organized a team of electoral agents from his Polish retinue, who also maintained a connection between him and Czajkowski.

The &quot;Beizadea&quot; was intent on obtaining recognition by the Second French Empire. In September 1858, while presenting his resignation from the Ottoman army, he addressed Napoleon a letter which expressed commitment to unifying the Principalities into a French-allied polity; he also co-ordinated his efforts with Wallachia&#x27;s outgoing &quot;Caimacam&quot;, Alexandru II Ghica, whom he met in the border town of Focșani. Sturdza Jr also recruited the Frenchman Jean Alexandre Vaillant, who put out a Sturdzist brochure that was read with interest by the French Foreign Minister, Alexandre Colonna-Walewski. As noted in various diplomatic records, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; enjoyed discreet backing by the French Consulate in Iași. More senior affiliates included C. Sion, who was primarily noted for his anti-union writings, supporting &quot;the rights of Moldavia as a state in its own right.&quot; Additional backing came from the newspaper &quot;Constituționariul&quot;, which was put out by Constantin Hurmuzachi and Grigore Balș, and which took up the &quot;conservative&quot; label as a self-designation. As recounted by Hurmuzachi, this coalition was formed only after Muklis&#x27; intense networking, which also saw him reconnecting with Ionescu de la Brad, who was by then a socialist. Hurmuzachi insisted that they had disagreements, especially after Sturdza had voiced his nostalgia for the Phanariotes and had issued only a mild critique of Vogoride; &quot;we avoided discussing union [under] a foreign prince.&quot;

Unlike Mihail, Sturdza Jr wanted to also take a seat in the Ad hoc Divan during the concurrent legislative election. As an Ottoman serviceman, he found his candidacy rejected by the Fălciu County tribunal, but could still win a seat in Iași County. He was finally validated by the Divan deputies, 32 votes to 20. Both Sturdzas, who ran their respective princely campaigns from the Roznovanu House (Mihail) and the Lozonschi Street villa (Grigore), were eventually rejected by a majority of delegates in the Divan. As noted by historiographer Daniel Clain, in this initial phase there were 30 deputies pledged to the Nationals, while Mihail and Grigore Sturdza had 21 and 13, respectively. The former group did not necessarily doubt that the Sturdzas also supported union, but still noted that &quot;under no circumstance&quot; could either of them take the throne. Vaillant, who had earlier supported the Nationals, believed that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was an objectively better and more moderate candidate, who could also serve as Wallachian Prince. He also argued that Mihail Sturdza was a &quot;separatist&quot;, tainted by his association with Vogoride. Officially, Sturdza Jr rallied to the nationalist platform of union, declaring that he himself would only vote for a unionist. This statement is seen by historian Petre P. Panaitescu as hypocritical: &quot;In fact, he was going to cast a vote for himself and could only do so as a separatist candidate, who had no supporters in Wallachia.&quot;

The Nationals held primaries at the Grecianu home, in front of an elephant skeleton, with a long series of runoffs; the &quot;Beizadea&quot; absented. As Hurmuzachi recounts, the &quot;democrats&quot; within the National Party, who would only back a non-boyar, were frustrated in their attempt, and threatened to vote for the &quot;Beizadea&quot;. This move was curbed by Costache Rolla, who locked the door from the outside, and forced those inside to agree on a single candidate, namely the 1848 revolutionary Cuza. As detailed by historian Nicolae Iorga, Cuza was only allowed to run because of conspiratorial maneuvers by Colonel Pisoski, who &quot;issued threats, gun in hand, in the doorway of the debating room, should Cuza&#x27;s candidacy be rejected. Had it not been for him and his pistol, for his presence at the very entrance of that room, we would have seen the election carried by Mihai[l]-Voivode or by &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore!&quot; The Nationals now had 32 deputies, while the Sturdzas, by then, had 16 each; during the actual voting procedure, which took place at Grecianu, Cuza took an additional 16 votes from both his adversaries. Overall, Cuza&#x27;s victory could happen &quot;only because of the persistent conflicts between father and son&quot;, particularly since &quot;the partisans of &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore were absolutely irreducible, no promise and no enticement could ever get them to vote for Mihai[l] Voivode.&quot; Cuza himself was guided by a sense of justice, and, against National Party deputies (including Epureanu), openly defended the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s right to take a seat in the Ad hoc Divan.

At that final stage, Radu Rosetti reports, Mihail was conceding defeat and tried to transfer Grigore his votes. While he was simply defeated, Grigore found himself removed from the list of candidates, his status as an Ottoman serviceman being widely seen as incompatible with princely status. Debates continued over his eligibility as a Prince, prompting deputies to thoroughly review the conditions set in Paris. A majority of 35 deputies, including those loyal to his father, voted not to admit him into the race. Other delegates, in particular those of the clergy, abstained from voting once they realized the &quot;Beizadea&quot; could not win. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; himself absented from the vote which confirmed Cuza.

===Polish plot and Central Commission===
Immediately after the election, Sturdza Jr and Panu reemerged as Cuza supporters. The former raised the idea of a Cuza candidacy in Bucharest &quot;before anything official had been stated on this issue&quot;. Both he and Panu wrote articles hinting that Cuza should invade Wallachia and seize the throne in Bucharest; Strudza&#x27;s piece saw print in the National Party mouthpiece, &quot;Stéoa Dunărei&quot;. Cuza&#x27;s subsequent election in Wallachia effectively federated the two countries, as the &quot;United Principalities&quot;; he was crowned &quot;Domnitor&quot; in both capitals. &quot;Muklis&quot; went on public record with his praise of the union as &quot;something worthy of Romania&#x27;s most glorious times&quot;, asking that both Divans meet for a common session in Focșani. More secretly, he began to organize for resistance. The National Party&#x27;s V. A. Urechia claimed that young Sturdza being furious of his father&#x27;s interference, which had prevented him from swinging the &quot;old boyar&quot; vote. He reports that the former Pasha intended to use his Ottoman connections to prevent Cuza from ever gaining international recognition, and also that he was arming &quot;vagabonds&quot;, ready to &quot;storm into that Mr Cuza&#x27;s palace&quot;.

Various other sources suggest the existence of a Sturdzist plot against Cuza. Definitive information suggests that he could rely on some 1,200 Poles, answering to Nieczuia Wierzbicki, were gathered on Sturdza&#x27;s estates, with 6,000 more expected to join in from Wallachia and elsewhere. The Russian consul in Moldavia, Sergei Popov, noted that some partisans of &quot;Grigore Mukhlis&quot; had already been found in Bucharest, where they worked to undermine the possibility of a double election. Sturdza&#x27;s coded letter to Czajkowski suggests that he wanted to appoint himself &quot;Caimacam&quot; through bribery, for which he intended to open a credit line with Antoine Alléon&#x27;s bank. A January 1859 report by British Consul-General Henry Adrian Churchill notes Sturdza&#x27;s resentments, and also alleges that he was pondering an open rebellion. According to Churchill, the troops Sturdza had pledged for Cuza&#x27;s seizure of Bucharest were in fact mutinous and self-interested; they would have included Poles who viewed the Principalities as a stepping stone toward recovering Congress Poland. Rumors of such intrigues resulted in a temporary clampdown on Polish revolutionary cells in Moldavia: 23 Poles were arrested and 11 convicted during a trial which saw Sturdza appearing as a witness. An English Masonic agent, William Solioms, was also detained in connection with this intrigue.

The Moldavian press published reports according to which Wierzbicki was tasked with a sweeping social reform, as well as with the mass assassination of Moldavia&#x27;s political elite, in order to set the stage for Sturdza as &quot;prince of Romania&quot;. Sturdza himself rejected the rumor in an open letter carried by &quot;Stéoa Dunărei&quot;, but it was largely confirmed by Poles taken into custody. Scholar Juliusz Demel also reports that the plot was factual, since Czajkowski intended to carve Dobruja out of the Silistra Eyalet and set it up as a &quot;good base of training Polish insurgents&quot;, with Ottoman acquiescence. This would have made the area &quot;an uncomfortable neighbour for the Romanian state&quot;. Some details are disputed by historian Panaitescu, who proposes that, since Romanian and Polish nationalism coexisted in symbiosis, &quot;such an action that would go against the true interests of the Polish people [...] would in any case be unexpected.&quot; As he argues, the Polish groups supporting Sturdza were at most representatives of the Polish monarchist movement, and, in their relations with him, primarily agents of the Ottoman Empire.

In February 1859, &quot;Mémorial Diplomatique&quot; published a letter from Bucharest, which claimed that Sturdza, whose designs for a coup resembled &quot;mental alienation&quot;, was being held under watch by the authorities; it also alleged that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had managed to escape. During those same days, Alecsandri wrote that the attempted coup was &quot;much more reduced than we were told&quot;; however, as leader of the repression, Moldavian Colonel Fote made a conscious attempt not to inform the public about the scale of the conspiracy. In September 1859, Sturdza was released with no charges being pressed—Iași&#x27;s Criminal Court dismissed the interrogation of Polish suspects as only producing hearsay about Sturdza himself. According to Panaitescu, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; only escaped imprisonment because, at that early stage, Cuza was unwilling to strike at the &quot;great boyardom&quot;. Cuza scholar Dumitru Ivănescu suggests that Sturdza was rendered &quot;harmless&quot; by Wierzbicki&#x27;s arrest; the regime had no interest in finding him guilty, since such a verdict would have created more division.

Official records for that same interval point to Sturdza as a Cuza loyalist: during January–April 1859, he rallied with the Divan deputies who voted for a property tax and an international loan in order to balance Moldavia&#x27;s budget and create a unified army. Sturdza then served on the Principalities&#x27; Central Judicial Commission, based at Focșani, whereby he introduced legislation which contained the first-ever Romanian references to &quot;human rights&quot;. At this stage, Sturdza veered back into conservatism, instigating a veto against electoral reform. As he put in his opinion, voiced on June 2, 1859, any change in the suffrage would authorize government to dissolve the Moldavian and Wallachian assemblies and hold early elections. The same month, Sturdza and another Commission member, Constantin N. Brăiloiu, argued that &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; was still a source of constitutional power—this interpretation was deemed manipulative even by other members of the conservative right, including Ion Emanuel Florescu. As noted by historian A. D. Xenopol, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; effectively rendered into legal jargon the boyar program: &quot;the party of the past simply did not want to extend voting rights so as to preserve its control on stately affairs&quot;. Sturdza was noted for refusing to congratulate Cuza on his birthday, as well as for rejecting any suggestion that the Commission owed its mandate to the &quot;Domnitor&quot;.

The Commission proceedings also witnessed Sturdza&#x27;s advocacy for calling in a &quot;foreign prince&quot; to rule over the Principalities. He veered to the right more than other members: in his legal reading, Cuza was only legitimate &quot;for as long as Europe will not send us a foreign prince&quot;—a phrasing which appeared, almost identical, in the constitutional project submitted for approval by the commission. Their claim was ridiculed by Cuza&#x27;s leading Moldavian partisan, Kogălniceanu, who read in it traces of Sturdza&#x27;s spite (paraphrased as: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t be a reigning prince; well then, neither will you&quot;). In September 1859, however, he agreed with Cuza that the Commission needed to work on solving &quot;the question between landowners and villagers&quot;—by which Cuza actually meant a major land reform.

===&quot;Monstrous coalition&quot;===
Unlike other Moldavian delegates on the commission, Sturdza fully supported establishing the national capital in Bucharest; as he put it, Iași was both insufficiently bourgeois and insufficiently Romanian. He then stood in the Romanian Assembly of Deputies, representing the right-wing opposition to Cuza&#x27;s egalitarian policies. As noted by Xenopol, he was the &quot;most progressive&quot; right-winger, endorsing public schooling, mass recruitment, and the land value tax, as well as an increased salary for the Moldavian Prime Minister, who was by then his nominal rival Kogălniceanu. In January 1861, he objected as other conservatives passed a motion of no confidence against Kogălniceanu&#x27;s administration, arguing that the accusations of corruption brought up against the head of government were unfounded. Sturdza&#x27;s flirtation with liberalism ended when it came to land reform—as the &quot;landowners&#x27; main champion&quot;, from May 1862 he was an outspoken opponent of attempts to dispossess boyars and the gentry at the benefit of peasants. He upheld a rival project provided for common land in rural communities, with family allotments of, at most, 15 square kilometers. Attempting to solve peasant destitution by other means, he set up his own lands in Iași County to function as model farms, introducing fallow techniques that more than doubled the expected output. He continued to live as an aristocrat—in 1861, he dueled with, and killed, Costin Vârnav over a dance-floor scuffle.

As early as 1861, Sturdza had declared his astonishment that Cuza never selected Wallachia and Moldavia&#x27;s still-separate cabinets from the respective majorities, noting that this habit prevented Romania from joining the ranks of &quot;constitutional states&quot;. He preserved his oppositionist stance following the creation in early 1862 of a unified cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister of Romania. In December 1862, he joined Panu, Barbu Bellu and 29 other deputies in signing a letter of protest against Prime Minister Nicolae Crețulescu, which actually criticized the &quot;Domnitor&quot;. Sturdza was persuaded that Cuza was turning to dictatorial means such as changing governments &quot;with each season&quot; and asking civilians to carry out illegal orders.In February 1863, he asked for Negri, who was Cuza&#x27;s diplomatic agent and Sturdza&#x27;s former rival in the princely election, to be prosecuted on such grounds. Also then, he made a point of reminding to the Assembly that the Ad hoc Divans had pressed for union under a foreign-born prince as &quot;the wish of an entire nation.&quot; This stance was rejected by deputy Nicolae Rucăreanu, who claimed that &quot;if the nation has voted for a foreign prince, it was because this option was imposed on it by the intelligentsia, and not by its own senses.&quot; Sturdza&#x27;s attack on Cuza was also regarded as tactless by the ultra-liberal &quot;Reds&quot;. Their doyen Ion Brătianu suggested that, under the circumstances, Romania could only find herself ruled by &quot;some Moskal or Austrian prince, or by some Turkish pasha&quot;.

As argued by the anti-boyar journalist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Sturdza was behaving insincerely, since he was viewing himself as a likely replacement for Cuza. In April 1863, this was also noted by Kogălniceanu, who was at the time serving as head of the national cabinet. He spoke about Sturdza as a man of genius, and implied that for this very reason his attempt to gain the throne needed to be resisted—the implication was that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was exceptionally equipped for subverting the Principalities&#x27; new liberal order. Late that same month, Petre Mavrogheni began campaigning for a Sturdza cabinet to replace Kogălniceanu&#x27;s, but the project was fully abandoned in June. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; expected to be backed by the French Empire, but found himself isolated. France&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys, passed it on to Cuza that he &quot;knew nothing about prince G. Sturdza&#x27;s political value&quot;.

These events unfolded in the context of a Polish–Russian civil war, which also rekindled Polish activities in Wallachia and Moldavia. In July 1863, the Bessarabian town of Coștangalia witnessed a skirmish between 400 Polish volunteers, recruited by Czajkowski and Zygmunt Miłkowski, and Romanian regulars, who had orders to stop their advance into Russia. After Miłkowski&#x27;s subsequent arrest, Cuza&#x27;s men speculated that the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had a part to play in the affair. The rumor was partly validated by Gorchakov, who spoke of Sturdza as leading a &quot;common action of the Polish and Romanian revolutionaries.&quot; During November 1863, Sturdza and George Barbu Știrbei welcomed in Bucharest Panu, the chief of Moldavia&#x27;s anti-Cuza movement, who was to supervise their &quot;monstrous coalition&quot;. At around that time, a French diplomat, Pierre Baragnon, had contacted Miłkowski, prodding him to form a Polish Ottoman army that would depose Cuza and redivide the country, placing the &quot;Beizadea&quot; on the throne in Iași. Miłkowski dismissed the offer, later clarifying that he wanted no part in &quot;dissolving the unity of Romania&quot;. The Panu group publicized a program which incorporated most of the &quot;Red&quot; agenda, endorsing decentralization, press freedoms, and an extension of voting rights with literacy tests; it also provided for a selective land reform with the full abolition of the &quot;corvée&quot;.

In January 1864, Cuza responded to Sturdza&#x27;s maneuvers by calling on Ilfov County&#x27;s &quot;peasant militia&quot; to deploy in the city&#x27;s streets. Reportedly, this caused both Sturdza and Știrbei to end their conspiracy and leave the country. &quot;Before they left for Paris,&quot; they reportedly sent a letter to Cuza&#x27;s left-wing adversary, C. A. Rosetti, demanding to know why he, as leader of the &quot;Reds&quot;, could not prevent the hostile alliance between the urban masses and the armed peasants. During February, however, Sturdza acquiesced to Cuza&#x27;s projected land reform, offering to contribute money for the compensated dispossession of monastery estates. Returning from Paris later in 1864, he approached the &quot;Red&quot; politico Dimitrie Brătianu, who may have acted as a liaison between anti-Cuza conservatives and Polish revolutionaries. Others however knew him as a partner in Moldavia&#x27;s Russophile circles. In May 1864, Ioan Dabija claimed to speak for the Bessarabian Romanians as loyal subjects of the Russian Emperor. He rejected reunification with the Principalities, on the grounds that Romanian politicians were incompetent and evil. The few exceptions, Dabija argued, were &quot;good patriots&quot; like Sturdza, Lascăr Catargiu, and Dimitrie Ghica.

===1866 events===

The political unrest was briefly ended that same month by Cuza&#x27;s self-coup. In August 1865, at a time of mounting discontent, representatives of this regime allegedly raided Sturdza&#x27;s home in Perieni, &quot;but without success.&quot; Cuza&#x27;s reign was finally brought to an end by the &quot;monstrous coalition&quot; counter-coup of February 1866. Over the following months of unrest, Romania (as the Principalities were now formally known) selected Carol of Hohenzollern, a Prussian subject, as their new &quot;Domnitor&quot;. His predecessor&#x27;s abdication created the terrain for active separatism, which was promoted by Russia&#x27;s agents in Moldavia. An April report in the Transylvanian press had it that &quot;prince Gregoriu Sturza, under the condition of a foreign prince, has renounced his candidacy, but under other circumstances he will use any means to see himself on the throne.&quot;

As noted by Radu Rosetti, some of the boyardom dreamed of restoring independence, &quot;but they were mostly old men, with no energy left for accomplishing dreams of youth. The only one who still had the required energy and willpower, &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore Sturdza, never even made a move.&quot; In March 1866, the &quot;Beizadea&quot;, having been made a Colonel in the Romanian military, was also serving as the Prefect of Iași County. To the &quot;Reds&quot;, he was primarily known as an abuser of the office. In May, this job confronted Sturdza with the Iași separatist riots, which doubled as outbreaks of antisemitic violence; restoring order by military force, he issued a proclamation extending his personal guarantee of safety to the Jewish locals.

Overall, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; remained sympathetic toward the moderate separatists. In July 1867, he was at Roman, where he signed up to a platform which called for the establishment of a regional Moldavian caucus that would defy &quot;Red&quot; centralism. The document was also backed by Nicu Ceaur-Aslan and Nicolae Iamandi (both of the Free and Independent Faction); other signatories included Grigore Balș, Panait Balș, Grigore Vârnav, and Colonel Pavlov. Their initiative was rejected by the &quot;Red&quot; Prime Minister, Constantin A. Crețulescu, who argued that regional caucuses were not permitted under the 1866 Constitution. That same month, &quot;Gazetta de Iașĭ&quot; published the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s response to Crețulescu, who had threatened to break up the regionalist rally by force. In it, Sturdza informed the &quot;Reds&quot; that liberal &quot;anarchy&quot; would be swept away by the &quot;great party of Order and Stability&quot;; he also called for a protest gathering to be held in August.

In October, following separatist Teodor Boldur-Lățescu&#x27;s scuffle with two Wallachian officers, Sturdza signed his name to protests addressed to Carol. Although reaffirming their loyalism, Sturdza and the other signatories demanded that Boldur-Lățescu be tried by an independent court in Focșani. Sturdza also served for a while as Chief of the Romanian Police section in Iași, retiring to a position on the board of Sfântul Spiridon Hospital. His split with C. A. Rosetti was rendered manifest after the election of March 1869, when he introduced a formal motion to have Rosetti sent to a mental hospital. During April, Sturdza presided a delegation which welcomed Carol as he visited Iași; on the occasion, the &quot;Domnitor&quot; visited with his mother Săftica.

===&quot;White&quot; politico===
In January 1870 the &quot;Beizadea&quot;, backed by 65 Assembly deputies, presented a motion to grant Carol a gift of 300 thousand francs. As reported by opposition papers, this was in fact a disguised gift for the &quot;Domnitor&quot;″s wife, Elisabeth of Wied. In February, the anti-&quot;Red&quot; government coalition, headed by Golescu-Negru, reportedly considered reappointing him Prefect of Iași. The troubled year 1871 signaled Sturdza&#x27;s political rise as the leader of an arch-conservative caucus. The defeat of conspiratorial &quot;Reds&quot; following incidents known as the &quot;Republic of Ploiești&quot; was consecrated in the May 1871 election. On April 18, Sturdza helped organize the conservative caucus in Iași, which met at his home; it included &quot;about a hundred people&quot;, with his former enemy Epureanu as their leader. Addressing the gathering, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; outlined a plan for modifying the Constitution to solidify Carol&#x27;s rule and ensure continuity. These ideas were also embraced by Epureanu and Iacob Negruzzi, who also spoke on the occasion—the latter&#x27;s address was perceived by journalist as an endorsement of absolute monarchy.

Speaking for the &quot;Political Committee of Conservative Liberals&quot;, Sturdza publicized this &quot;Iași Petition&quot;, which caused anger in liberal circles, and concern among some of the conservative &quot;Whites&quot;, with its demands—including not just a reduction of voting power for the lower classes, but also colonization by Germans and the death penalty. In presenting the argument for the latter, Sturdza noted: &quot;Under Prince Mihail Sturza, after they hanged a few robbers, personal security became absolute and there were no more cases of either robbery or murder.&quot; As noted by political scientist Apostol Stan, the document was in effect a program for &quot;more or less a personal rule&quot; by &quot;White&quot; Prime Minister Catargiu. This initiative also brought the first clashes between Sturdza and the cultural society &quot;Junimea&quot;, which was turning into a political faction, and which counted Negruzzi among its leaders. According to memoirist George Panu, at that stage Sturdza &quot;never absented&quot; from the literary conferences presented in Iași by Titu Maiorescu, the &quot;Junimea&quot; doyen, and &quot;greatly enjoyed&quot; Negruzzi&#x27;s work in political satire. Sturdza however insisted that the Petition be signed by all right-wingers in the Assembly; &quot;Junimist&quot; deputies, also based in Iași, only agreed to sign parts of the document.

Used by the opposition to ridicule the &quot;Whites&quot; (&quot;Telegraphulŭ&quot; newspaper referred to Sturdza and his colleagues as &quot;boyars, parvenus of the regime, and scoundrels&quot; who had unmasked their reactionary agenda), the Petition was in fact ignored by Catargiu. Sturdza still tried to win over the public with his demands, touring all of Western Moldavia in the summer of 1871. Hasdeu claimed that the concurrent election was overall rigged, since aristocrats such as Sturdza and Maiorescu had been elected by peasant voters in the 4th College; conservative groups also celebrated his personal contribution in ensuring success for &quot;official candidates&quot;, though they noted that this was the result of procedures which Sturdza simply upheld. The former &quot;Beizadea&quot; was himself continuously elected to either the Assembly or the Senate, for all legislatures down to his death.

As a personal friend of Catargiu&#x27;s, Sturdza was depicted by &quot;Iași&#x27;s newspapers&quot; as a &quot;most energetic pillar of the party of order and stability on that side of the Milcov.&quot; In 1874, the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s established in Iași a &quot;Landlords&#x27; Club&quot;, which was probably co-founded by Epureanu. Its creation was received with alarm by Ionescu de la Brad, who noted that Sturdza was mostly interested in using a nominal association of agricultural interests for his political scheming. Rumors rendered by Ionescu suggest that Sturdza had created himself an appendant body of Freemasonry, and that many inductees quit upon realizing that they were being used. Overall, only a minority of the club&#x27;s members could be counted as property owners. Mostly used for dance parties, it became &quot;only from time to time, and for a few days on end, a political and conservative club.&quot; Another one of Sturdza&#x27;s leading passions was in constructing early flying machines. In 1875, he used his father&#x27;s Lozonschi house as a hangar for his glider. A friend of his, a gymnastics professor known as Spinzi, attempted to pilot it from a tower in Cristești, but the launch ended in failure. This remains one of the earliest documented fixed-wing flight attempts by a Romanian, between those of Constantin Nestor (1765) and Ion Stoica (1884).

Sturdza had by then renounced his claim to the Romanian throne. As recalled by Radu Rosetti, Sturdza spoke very favorably of Carol, and spent time vacationing with him in Sinaia. During one such outing, Sturdza sought to impress local peasants by pummeling a rock into small pieces—his performance was not appreciated by the monarch, who found it to be in bad taste. Carol was again in Iași in October 1875, with Sturdza as his host. Tensions between the various &quot;White&quot; factions became evident during the elections of that year, which Catargiu lost to the consolidated &quot;Red&quot; opposition, or National Liberal Party (PNL). Sturdza and his associate Ceaur-Aslan voiced their displeasure when &quot;Junimea&quot; was co-opted by Catargiu to strengthen &quot;White&quot; chapters in Moldavia; however, Sturdza agreed not to run in the 3rd College at Iași, leaving it to be contested by the &quot;Junimist&quot; Petre P. Carp, and instead ran for the 4th College at Fălciu. As noted by Stan, the subsequent conflict between Carp and Sturdza prevented the &quot;Whites&quot; from forming a unified caucus that would compete with the PNL. In February 1876, ahead of government-mandated repeat elections, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; made a public show of his anti-&quot;Junimism&quot;, also breaking with Catargiu to present himself as an independent candidate in Iași&#x27;s 2nd College. By 1878, both Sturdza and Kogălniceanu had set up independent groups that competed for the Moldavian vote. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; was Chairman of the Moldavian Conservative-Liberal Party, while his Lunéville colleague presided upon a Moderate Liberal Party. The two groups formed an alliance for the local elections at Iași, in November 1878.

===National-Democratic leader===
Sturdza adopted controversial stances during the Romanian War of Independence, which saw Romania aligned with Russia against the Ottomans. In order to obtain recognition for its separation from the Ottoman realm, Romania had to consider emancipating its non-Orthodox residents; and enduring controversy focused on the extent of Jewish emancipation. Sturdza sided with Conservative Generals Gheorghe Manu and Ion Emanuel Florescu. They proposed that naturalization could only be fast-tracked in individual cases, and with an Assembly supermajority. Upon the end of the war in 1878, Romanians were faced with a Russian demand to relinquish southern Bessarabia, in exchange for Northern Dobruja. Nationalists were generally indignant, and Carol threatened to abdicate during February 1878; as reported by &quot;Politische Correspondenz&quot;, this suited Russia, which had Sturdza as its favorite candidate for the throne. The issue was settled in Romania&#x27;s detriment by the Treaty of Berlin, which was signed in July 1878. Over the following months, Sturdza was acknowledged as a proponent of Balkan federalism—though not necessarily of a Balkan state to include Romania.

During the late months of 1879, Sturdza and his followers were at the center of a renewed controversy over Moldavian separatism and Russian influence. In October, a Russian diplomatic report referred to the &quot;Beizadea&quot; as the leader of a &quot;Moldavian party&quot;, implying that he was interested in rekindling Moldavian secession. Historians Gheorghe N. Căzan and Șerban Rădulescu-Zoner rate Sturdza&#x27;s speeches of 1879 as &quot;propaganda for a Russian–Romanian rapprochement&quot;, arguing that he &quot;still craved to obtain the crown with support from the Tsar.&quot; On December 1, Sturdza created a publicized row in the Senate by refusing to endorse Ion Brătianu&#x27;s PNL premiership, and in particular Brătianu&#x27;s address on the state of the nation. In his response, he outlined the &quot;conservative program&quot; as a political alternative, and discussed instances of voter suppression. Responses to this message were mixed: &quot;Pressa&quot;, as the mainstream &quot;White&quot; newspaper, agreed with his core stances, but rejected his approach to foreign affairs; C. A. Rosetti&#x27;s &quot;Românul&quot; ignored Sturdza&#x27;s claim that the speech represented only himself, and ridiculed it as a sample of &quot;operetta&quot; conservatism.

In February 1880, &quot;Whites&quot; coalesced into a more centralized group, the Conservative Party. Sturdza refused to join the movement, upset that the party leadership went to Epureanu; he was also opposed to the mainstream chapters in that he had become a Russophile, wishing for Romania to be brought into the orbit of Tsarist autocracy. Instead, he established a &quot;minuscule political faction&quot;, the &quot;National-Democratic Party&quot;, which put out its own daily, &quot;Democrația Națională&quot;. Its few affiliates included a Wallachian soldier, Christian Tell, who stayed with Sturdza for a few months, serving as the party&#x27;s Vice President before he eventually deserted to the Conservatives. &quot;Democrația Națională&quot;″s editor was Grigore H. Grandea, previously noted for his anti-Russian stances; other associates were lawyer Petre Borș and journalist Milone Lugomirescu. During the National-Democratic episode, Sturdza paid for a state-modeled personal bureaucracy, which included hiring a retired police captain, Gheorghe &quot;Păpușică&quot; Florescu, to run a private information service.

On March 3, 1880, Sturdza attempted a show of force, speaking in the Senate against the validation of Alecu D. Holban. Ion Ghica noted that the display, attended by Florescu and his men, was overall weak, as was Sturdza&#x27;s speech. On June 2, National-Democrats held congress at the Romanian Atheneum, braving crowds of opponents gathered outside that building. There as well as in the Senate, Sturdza outlined the National-Democratic platform, which included devolution to Local Assemblies and a plan for the in-depth defense of Romanian territory. Another rallying point for the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s followers was their opposition to electoral reforms—Sturdza argued that the suffrage was already extensive, and that further enfranchisement would result in a tyranny of the majority. From January 1881, the group also made show of its opposition to the Germanophile line embraced by the &quot;Junimists&quot;, and thereafter by the Conservatives. &quot;Democrația Națională&quot;″s agenda was also poorly reviewed by &quot;Pressa&quot; who mistrusted its self-designated centrism. Instead, &quot;Pressa&quot; argued that the National-Democrats stood for &quot;all that is old and extremely old&quot;, &quot;reemerging now, after a 50-year rest in the realm of oblivion&quot; as advocates of &quot;Slavic nationalism&quot;.

In December 1880, Ion Pietraru made an unsuccessful attempt on Brătianu&#x27;s life, which police presumed to be part of a wider conspiracy implicating Sturdza and Russia—several party members, including Grandea, were arrested, though Sturdza vouched for their innocence. Shortly after, a pseudonymous Romanian nationalist in Bessarabia published an open letter, arguing that Sturdza was sponsoring Grigore Hrisoscoleu to deny Bessarabia&#x27;s Russification. The Pietraru incident put an end to &quot;Democrația Națională&quot;, officially because of Sturdza&#x27;s anger that his journalists had insulted Brătianu and other figures of the PNL administration; the party was also dissolved, in 1881. In that context, Sturdza explained that he had grown fonder of the PNL, which had shown itself open toward a Romanian–Russian alliance. Though briefly detained as an alleged Pietraru accomplice, Captain Florescu resurfaced in public life as a PNL member. Commenting on his reconversion, memoirist Constantin Bacalbașa notes: &quot;It is a well known fact that most of Prince Grigore Sturza&#x27;s confidants were bought off by government. This is what made this party, which existed only because of &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore&#x27;s ambition, disappear within 24 hours.&quot;

According to writer Constantin Gane, &quot;Democrația Națională&quot;″s alarmist messages about Romania&#x27;s standing in Europe pushed the PNL establishment into reestablishing the country as a &quot;Kingdom of Romania&quot;—whether to increase the government&#x27;s prestige or to &quot;uplift the country&quot;. Eugene Schuyler, as the first US diplomatic agent in Romania, wrote on March 26 that there was a chance of Sturdza returning to his &quot;posing as a pretender to the crown. While many families thought their members had rights to be princes, no one can have the pretention to be King.&quot; Four days later Schuyler reported that: &quot;The step has been accepted, if not thoroughly approved, by the members of the foreign reigning families, some of whom took part in the act.&quot; As an example, he cited Mihail Sturdza being welcomed into the Order of the Star of Romania by Carol. From May 1883, &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore served in Dimitrie Ghica&#x27;s commission for constitutional revision.

===BZD Club===
In January 1882, Grigore Sturdza was being labeled a &quot;Slavophile&quot; by the Austrian press, which reported on his &quot;conventicles&quot; of Iași in connection with a visit by Miroslav Hubmajer, known for having fought in an anti-Austrian rebellion in 1875. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; remained unrelenting in his critique of Brătianu&#x27;s foreign policies, exposing Austria-Hungary for using the Danube Commission to limit Romania&#x27;s navigation rights. His speeches drew attention from a &quot;Junimist&quot; poet-journalist, Mihai Eminescu. In an 1882 piece, he declared his admiration for Sturdza&#x27;s &quot;so very clear, so very beautiful&quot; Romanian oratory, stripped of neologisms and verbosity. Eminescu mused that the effect of using &quot;good, direct, informal Romanian&quot;, or what he termed the &quot;old language&quot;, was like introducing pagans to Christian music by Palestrina.

In the elections in October 1888, Sturdza took a senatorial seat in Iași&#x27;s 1st College, having run on the joint list presented by the PNL and the Radical Party. Upon confirmation, he embodied the right-wing opposition to Conservative governments. Allegedly, by 1887 he had joined the group of politicians who supported the project of Bulgarian–Romanian unification, and &quot;toasted to its accomplishment with one of our great dignitaries of State.&quot; In his November 1888 speech before the Senate, he declared that the merger of Conservative and &quot;Junimists&quot; had produced first an experimental cabinet under Theodor Rosetti, and afterwards a non-representative one under General Manu. He also argued that Romania would be better off in an alliance with Russia and the French Republic against the German Empire &quot;(see Franco-Russian Alliance)&quot;, insisting that Germany and its Triple Alliance were fundamentally weak. In May of the following year, he attacked Brătianu and General Brialmont&#x27;s plan for fortifying Romania&#x27;s plain cities, noting that the only naturally defensible stronghold was at Focșani. He also contended that Romania was helpless in front of a Russian invasion, advising government to declare neutrality and grant safe passage to the Russian armies. Between 1891 and 1895, under a new Catargiu cabinet, Sturdza and his followers, collectively known as the BZD Club (from &quot;Beizadea&quot;), formed an uneasy alliance with the Conservatives, openly stating that they preferred Manu for the position of Prime Minister.

Grigore and Olga Sturdza did not have a happy marriage. He never saw himself bound by matrimonial fidelity, and continued to keep, and brag about, his seraglio that, at any time, comprised twelve concubines; commenting on this &quot;harem&quot;, Cantacuzène noted that &quot;customs and decency did not exist for this Sturdza prince&quot;. A widower after June 1867, Sturdza was reportedly married to another woman for some 6 months in 1874—this resulted in the birth of a son whom he did not recognize as first, and who took the name of Dimitrie Pavelescu. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; finally married Ralu Turculeț, who was reportedly a Romani woman who shocked aristocratic sensibilities with her &quot;garish clothes and makeup&quot;. Olga had given birth to three children, all of whom died very young. A son, Dimitrie, was born in May 1856; he died before turning 16, from what was reported as a cold or a case of typhoid fever. The couple also had two daughters, Elena and Olga. The latter, noted for her unusual physical strength, had married Emanuel Vogoridi in January 1876. She became fatally ill with pneumonia after bathing in the Siret River. Elena, married with Mihai Sturdza Bârlădeanu, died in childbirth—doctors found that she was physically damaged by a routine of calisthenics, which Grigore had imposed on her in the belief that it would ease her pregnancy.

The family patriarch Mihail Sturdza died in his Parisian exile on May 7 or 8, 1884. This resulted in a legal battle between Grigore Sturdza, Dimitrie Sturdza, and Maria Gorchakov. As reported by &quot;Le Matin&quot;, the latter two had conspired to defraud Grigore of his inheritance. The Sturdza civil trial began in 1891 and was taken to the Court of Cassation in 1893, and again in 1897. An initial ruling by the court of Galați commanded Gorchakov to pay her stepbrother the equivalent of 5 million United States dollars, and to transfer him the Sturdza vacation residence in Baden-Baden. As reported at the time: &quot;The judgment financially ruins the princess.&quot; This was partly upheld in March 1898, when an appellate court in Amiens ordered Goncharov to pay Sturdza 800,000 Dutch guilder in damages. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; was also fighting for the recovery of his lands, those that had been nationalized in 1854. In 1883, he had obtained a compensation of 500 thousand lei and interest, which he found unsatisfactory. An appellate court in Iași eventually ruled that his dispossession had been an act of war, and therefore that he could only be compensated by a parliamentary vote.

Despite his lifelong conservatism, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was being courted by the PNL&#x27;s conservative wings. In 1884, he and the PNL&#x27;s Eugeniu Stătescu sought to introduce a law whereby acts of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; would be tried in ordinary courts—a polemic ensued between them and C. A. Rosetti, who supported complete freedom of speech. During the final days of 1885, &quot;a political rally was held in prince Gr. Sturdza&#x27;s salon at Iași&quot;, which confirmed that he and his followers &quot;adhered to the policies of the prime minister [Brătianu].&quot; In November 1887, rumors began surfacing that Sturdza was offered chairmanship of the PNL&#x27;s Iași section. In the following decade, however, the BZD sought to reaffirm its independence. In the by-elections of May 1895, held for the 2nd-College seat in Iași, it scored a surprise win for its candidate, Nicu Catargiu. According to the left-wing newspaper &quot;Lupta&quot;, in July 1895 it branched out in Bucharest, counting on support from Constantin Creangă and his rolling paper factory. The same source reported that the Bucharest club merely intended to defraud the &quot;Beizadea&quot;, who had pledged them a 1-million-lei sponsorship.

===Retirement===
Sturdza was finally attracted into the PNL during the general elections of November 1895—at the time, the group was turning right-wing under the chairmanship of a relative, D. A. Sturdza. Sturdza and his BZD partisans presented themselves on the PNL list for the Assembly, which effectively ended their prospects of ever returning into the Conservative fold. With 171 votes, he was the third winner on the PNL list for Iași&#x27;s 1st College, behind Ștefan C. Șendrea and Toma Stelian. In early 1896, Sturdza and his followers tried to mediate between PNL leaders and the breakaway faction of Nicolae Fleva: &quot;The &quot;Beizadea&quot; keeps pleading for reconciliation, since he is very much keen on maintaining his prevalence at Iași.&quot; As reported by the opposition newspaper &quot;Epoca&quot;, by early May 1898 the PNL majority had pledged 1.5 million lei to Sturdza, as compensation for his 1854 expropriation. &quot;Epoca&quot; noted that this was in fact a &quot;baksheesh&quot;. The same source also reported that, later that month, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was attempting to rejoin the opposition, since the other Sturdza would not honor his promise. He still had his own thoughts on European affairs, and in December 1896 insisted that &quot;Romania should find support in Russia&quot;. This remark was disputed by Foreign Minister Constantin Stoicescu, who noted that the country needed to remain neutral in the Oriental crises. The &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s political irrelevancy was signaled in 1898 by cartoonist Nicolae Petrescu Găină, who depicted him as an Ottoman relic, adding the caption: &quot;He was once something, what can he be now?&quot;
According to Radu Rosetti: &quot;In his youth, &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore passed for a Neronian character; we, those who met him towards the end, never had that impression&quot;. He recalls his 1894 visit to the Lozonschi villa, which the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had fitted with massively oversized furniture. The building, he notes, was &quot;in a state of ruin&quot;. According to Cantacuzène, Sturdza &quot;lived in the only wing that was still holding together&quot;, a state of decay that was also noticeable in his retinue: Sturdza had &quot;a dilapidated carriage, driven by a coachman in a threadbare livery that was too long and too wide for him&quot;. Political writer Mariu Theodorian-Carada recalls a chance meeting with Sturdza at Hotel Carol in Constanța, in July 1891. He was struck by the former Pasha&#x27;s &quot;mahogany beard&quot; and 1870s clothes.

The &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s final years were mostly dedicated to experimental science, leading him to become a founding member of the &quot;Société astronomique&quot;; as reported by Klumpke, he had since taken a degree from the &quot;École normale supérieure&quot;, studying under Louis Pasteur. Over thirty years, Sturdza investigated the &quot;fundamental laws of the Universe&quot;, producing the eponymous tract &quot;Lois fondamentales de l&#x27;univers&quot; (1891). Though described by scholar Barbu Berceanu as &quot;perhaps the only systematic encyclopedic work with just one author, a Romanian&quot;, it was allegedly ghostwritten in part by a professional astronomer, Constantin Căpităneanu, who died in 1893. A sequel, &quot;L&#x27;Ordre moral&quot; (&quot;Moral Order&quot;), also outlined his philosophical inquiry about the &quot;ideal religion&quot;. Overall, Sturdza&#x27;s ideas on such topics were admired by Camille Flammarion, the French astronomer and parapsychologist, garnering a more ambiguous response from physicist Jacques Babinet. One of the tenets of the books was a hypothesis on astrochemistry, with Sturdza calculating &quot;that there are ninety-three nonillions of trentillions of atoms condensed in the eighty million stars, or altogether one-hundred and eight-six nonillions of trentillions of atoms&quot;.

Sturdza also continued to work in designing flying machines with &quot;cardboard wings&quot; which he infamously tested by peasants living on his estates, who suffered broken limbs as a result. An &quot;airplane of his own design&quot; was assigned to be driven by &quot;one poor Gypsy, who got killed on his first attempt&quot;. In 1891, he was still passionate about flying, and theorized about the coming age of motorized aircraft. Sturdza&#x27;s theories and experiments extended to the opera, seeing him as a critic of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;dissonant and deafening music&quot;. By 1879, he had authored several fantasias, with motifs from Gaetano Donizetti and Gioachino Rossini. As reported by Lisbon&#x27;s &quot;Diário Illustrado&quot;, the works were &quot;simply impossible to perform&quot; and &quot;cannot be found for sale anywhere in Europe&quot;. 

Sturdza did however play chamber music with his &quot;Junimist&quot; friend Alexandru Grigore Suțu, and invented an instrument that was reportedly used by the Paris Conservatory. This is probably the &quot;violin-harp&quot;, built for Sturdza by Thomas Zach. It had &quot;extra strings made of metal, for resonance&quot;. Exhibited at the 1873 World&#x27;s Fair, &quot;it did not turn out to be the revolutionary novelty they had hoped for. Instead of being larger and powerful, the tone was nasal and blurry.&quot; Sturdza was a major art sponsor in his capacity as chairman of the &quot;Amicii Artelor&quot; Society (1885), which existed as a challenge to &quot;Junimea&quot;″ cultural tenets. In February 1895 the &quot;Beizadea&quot; was dedicated the poetry volume &quot;Excelsior&quot; by its sponsored author, Alexandru Macedonski, who had helped popularize &quot;Les lois&quot;.

===Death===
Sturdza&#x27;s fortune grew to immense proportions after lawyer I. C. Barozzi, working on his behalf, discovered that Prince Mihail had hidden some 45 million lei in bullion on his various estates; Grigore was owed a third of this wealth. At some point between 1893 and 1899, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; bought himself a villa on Bucharest&#x27;s Calea Victoriei, but never lived in it, finally presenting is to his other lawyer, Constantin Dissescu, for services performed in the family trial. Sturdza also commissioned a German architect, Julius Reinecke, to construct the Sturdza Palace of Bucharest. This building was infamous for its extreme eclecticism and its overall uselessness, its &quot;immense rooms&quot; only meant to be used for racing &quot;a bicycle [Sturdza] had invented&quot;, and for various acrobatics. He &quot;barely lived inside the place, after having spent on it more than he could handle.&quot; According to Radu Rosetti, the Palace is also a testament to its sponsor&#x27;s &quot;utter lack of artistic taste&quot;. It was the scene of family dramas, which played during the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s final years. In January 1895, Sturdza forced his adoptive son, also named Grigore, to marry Maria Feodosiev-Cantacuzino. In love with Gizela Boga, the daughter of a shoemaker, he killed his lover, then committed suicide, some three weeks into his marriage. Their daughter, known as Olga Boga (sometimes rendered as Bogza), was subsequently &quot;raised, provided for, and married off by &quot;Beizadea&quot; Grigore&quot;, who also legally adopted her.

Grigore Jr&#x27;s suicide pushed Sturdza to recognize his other sons by various women, including Lieutenant Dimitrie Pavelescu, who became Pavelescu-Sturdza. This new arrival to the family made national news in August 1896, when he was listed as a victim of the Avramescu–Weintraub usurers&#x27; syndicate, who were allegedly aware that his father would honor any debt. During May 1897, the &quot;Beizadea&quot; sued the Lieutenant to have the adoption canceled. The first such ever case to be heard by a Romanian court, it prompted Pavelescu&#x27;s creditors to bring up proof of his paternity. Another adoptive son, Mihai, married Valeria, daughter of &quot;Junimist&quot; poet Veronica Micle; their own son, Grigore M. Sturdza, was noted as a modernist poet. Literary historian Elena Vulcănescu argues that writer and academic Paul Zarifopol, born 1874, may have unofficially been the child of Sturdza and Maria Stamatiu, who was then forced to marry the administrator of Sturdza&#x27;s manor in Cristești. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; also had daughters from his extramarital affairs, including one who became the wife of chemist-politician Petru Poni.

In his final months, Sturdza was frequently seen alongside his wife Ralu at the Georgescu Garden in Bucharest, where they watched sketch comedies by Nicolae Niculescu-Buzău and drank &quot;only mazagran&quot;. The &quot;Beizadea&quot; died on January 26 (Old Style: January 12 or 13), 1901. This occurred in his palace on Bonaparte Street, Bucharest, with the ultimate cause of death registered as &quot;double pneumonia&quot;, an illness which had consumed him for some 11 days. Aware that the disease was fatal, and &quot;so very proud of his own anatomy&quot;, &quot;he asked his physician to perform an autopsy on his cadaver&quot;; reportedly, his final activity was selecting a spot for one of his decorative statues.

==Legacy==
As &quot;Foaia Populară&quot; magazine put it, &quot;[Sturdza&#x27;s] death was much like his life: he died with a light conscience, effortlessly, at peace.&quot; The Bucharest funeral of &quot;Romania&#x27;s greatest-ever philanthropist&quot; involved &quot;the entire capital city, with everyone wishing to display their mourning.&quot; Memoirist Rudolf Șuțu additionally notes: &quot;With him we lost the very last gentleman of that fine race of gentleman of the heart, and gentlemen of the mind, standing for old Moldavia. He was a prince not only through his birthright and his blood, but more than everything though his natural intelligence, through his acquiring of a solid culture, through the charms of his great loving heart&quot;. The funeral oration was delivered by Macedonski.

Sturdza was survived by his wife Ralu, who soon began a new life as a nun in Agapia Monastery. The other living heirs were Pavelescu-Sturdza, as well as two other adoptive sons (Dimitrie Popovici-Sturdza, Captain Costică Ștefănescu-Sturdza), and granddaughter Olga. These and other relatives inherited his wealth, in accordance with his will, dated September 1895; the &quot;Beizadea&quot; had wanted his palace to be passed on the infant Prince of Romania, the future Carol II, but the gift was rejected by his grandfather, Carol I. Not included in this arrangement was another illegitimate son, the artisan Gheorghe Boboc, who sculpted his father&#x27;s mausoleum at Bellu Cemetery (which also featured a bust of the defunct, by Antoine Bourdelle). The legal battle over Mihail Sturdza&#x27;s inheritance was still ongoing in 1903, by then involving only siblings Dimitrie and Maria. Similar litigation surrounded Grigore&#x27;s own estate, which had been much reduced by expenses in the other trial. Journalist Alexandru Sc. Miclescu, who was serving time in Văcărești Prison, claimed to have accessed a more recent will of the &quot;Beizadea&quot;, and obtained a release on bail in exchange for presenting it. The case was ultimately closed when this document was deemed a forgery. Through Olga Boga and her husband Henri Meitani, Sturdza had a great-granddaughter; in March 1935, she committed suicide, or was murdered by her father, upon the revelation that she had fallen pregnant outside marriage.

In 1920, other Sturdzas moved the &quot;Beizadea&quot;″s remains out of the Boboc mausoleum, relocating them to a new grave at Agapia; the surviving cenotaph was vandalized in 1955. From 1908, the Sturdza–Dissescu villa was entirely rebuilt by Grigore Cerchez as a Romanian Revival structure, and currently houses the George Oprescu Institute for Art History. The Romanian Sturdzas, meanwhile, ran into financial difficulty with the upkeep of Sturdza Palaces. The one in Bucharest was overwhelmed by the homeless, and ultimately sold to the Romanian state in 1904, through the intercession of Conservative writer Duiliu Zamfirescu. It came to house Foreign Affairs—it was here that the Treaty of Bucharest was signed in August 1913. 

Ralu Strudza died at Agapia in October 1914, leaving most of her wealth to charity. After the fall of Bucharest and throughout the second half of World War I, the Foreign Affairs palace was used as a hospital by the Ottoman Army, housing victims of thiamine deficiency. In the early interwar years, the complex was only permanently used by a caretaker, Fr. Ștefănescu, and his family. In late 1933, an annex was being demolished to ease access from a neighboring street. Identified as decadent, the main building was slated for demolition as early as 1937, and finally torn down in late 1944. During its final years, it was the subject of a ditty mocking Foreign Minister Victor Antonescu. Its anonymous author quipped that, once &quot;built by a calf&quot;, the Palace was destined to house &quot;un bou&quot; (Romanian for both &quot;ox&quot; and &quot;cretin&quot;). The family palace in Iași survived its historical era, serving first as an Orthodox seminary and then as head offices for Radio Iași. Another one of Sturdza&#x27;s palatial homes existed on the Romanian Riviera, at Constanța, until being torn down in 1915.

<text>Virial coefficients formula_1 appear as coefficients in the virial expansion of the pressure of a many-particle system in powers of the density, providing systematic corrections to the ideal gas law. They are characteristic of the interaction potential between the particles and in general depend on the temperature. The second virial coefficient formula_2 depends only on the pair interaction between the particles, the third (formula_3) depends on 2- and non-additive 3-body interactions, and so on.

== Derivation ==

The first step in obtaining a closed expression for virial coefficients is a cluster expansion of the grand canonical partition function
: formula_4
Here formula_5 is the pressure, formula_6 is the volume of the vessel containing the particles, formula_7 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_8 is the absolute temperature, formula_9 is the fugacity, with formula_10 the chemical potential. The quantity formula_11 is the canonical partition function of a subsystem of formula_12 particles:
: formula_13
Here formula_14 is the Hamiltonian (energy operator) of a subsystem of formula_12 particles. The Hamiltonian is a sum of the kinetic energies of the particles and the total formula_12-particle potential energy (interaction energy). The latter includes pair interactions and possibly 3-body and higher-body interactions. The grand partition function formula_17 can be expanded in a sum of contributions from one-body, two-body, etc. clusters. The virial expansion is obtained from this expansion by observing that formula_18 equals formula_19. In this manner one derives
: formula_20
: formula_21.
These are quantum-statistical expressions containing kinetic energies. Note that the one-particle partition function formula_22 contains only a kinetic energy term. In the classical limit formula_23 the kinetic energy operators commute with the potential operators and the kinetic energies in numerator and denominator cancel mutually. The trace (tr) becomes an integral over the configuration space. It follows that classical virial coefficients depend on the interactions between the particles only and are given as integrals over the particle coordinates.

The derivation of higher than formula_3 virial coefficients becomes quickly a complex combinatorial problem. Making the classical approximation and
neglecting non-additive interactions (if present), the combinatorics can be handled graphically as first shown by Joseph E. Mayer and Maria Goeppert-Mayer.

They introduced what is now known as the Mayer function:
: formula_25
and wrote the cluster expansion in terms of these functions. Here formula_26 is the interaction potential between particle 1 and 2 (which are assumed to be identical particles).

== Definition in terms of graphs ==
The virial coefficients formula_1 are related to the irreducible Mayer cluster integrals formula_28 through
: formula_29

The latter are concisely defined in terms of graphs.
: formula_30

The rule for turning these graphs into integrals is as follows:
# Take a graph and label its white vertex by formula_31 and the remaining black vertices with formula_32.
# Associate a labelled coordinate k to each of the vertices, representing the continuous degrees of freedom associated with that particle. The coordinate 0 is reserved for the white vertex
# With each bond linking two vertices associate the Mayer f-function corresponding to the interparticle potential
# Integrate over all coordinates assigned to the black vertices
# Multiply the end result with the symmetry number of the graph, defined as the inverse of the number of permutations of the black labelled vertices that leave the graph topologically invariant.
The first two cluster integrals are
The expression of the second virial coefficient is thus:
: formula_33
where particle 2 was assumed to define the origin (formula_34).
This classical expression for the second virial coefficient was first derived by Leonard Ornstein in his 1908 Leiden University Ph.D. thesis.

<text>Burkhard Heim (; 9 February 1925 – 14 January 2001) was a German theoretical physicist known for creating a unified field theory called Heim theory. He was particularly interested in the application of his theory to the development of hyperspace travel.

==Academic and work history==
===1940s===
In 1943, Heim met Werner Heisenberg, a German physicist involved in atom bomb research, and told him of his plan to use a form of chemical implosion to facilitate an atomic explosion. This design was based on an idea he developed for a &#x27;clean&#x27; hydrogen bomb when he was 18. Heisenberg was impressed by Heim&#x27;s knowledge, but thought the approach would be impractical.

At the start of World War II, Heim avoided conscription into the German Air Force by working in a chemical laboratory as an explosives technician. When he was 19, an explosion in the laboratory caused by the mishandling of unstable compounds left him without hands and mostly deaf and blind. Heim underwent the Krukenberg Procedure after the accident.

After World War II, Heim registered to study physics at the University of Göttingen.

===1950s===
In 1952, during the third congressional session of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) in Stuttgart, Germany, Heim presented his theory for interplanetary propulsion under the title of &quot;Die dynamische Kontrabarie als Lösung des astronomischen Problems&quot; (The Dynamic Kontrabarie as Solution of the Astronautical Problem). It was the first time the idea of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces were treated as distortions of their proper Euclidean metrics in a higher-dimensional space. A brief description of Heim&#x27;s lecture was recorded in the proceedings of the Society for Space Research.

In 1954, he began to study under Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker in Göttingen. He wrote his diploma thesis on physical processes in the Crab Nebula Supernova. Then, he began to work at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Göttingen. However, he soon found it extremely difficult to work in a team due to his disabilities.

In 1955, Heim was contracted by the Glenn L. Martin Company to assist them with a gravity control propulsion project. The news about Heim&#x27;s contract was published during a period of increasing United States gravity control propulsion research (1955 - 1974).

In 1956, Heim completed a 27-page progress report that summarized his philosophy (syntrometry) and his theory (Principle of Dynamic Kontrabarie) for coupling general relativity with quantum dynamics for propulsion applications. Sample calculations for an expedition from the surface of the Earth to the surface of the planet Mars appeared at the end of Heim&#x27;s progress report.

In November 1957, Heim delivered a lecture about his propulsion theory to the German Society for Rocket Technology and Space Travel in Frankfurt. Subsequently, Wernher von Braun sought his comments on various aerospace projects. According to von Ludwiger, a German author known for his publication on UFOs, an audiotape of Heim&#x27;s presentation had been prepared for shipment to America.

In 1959, Heim completed his first publication in the German journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Flugkörper&quot; (&quot;Magazine for Missiles&quot;). Heim discussed &quot;the principle of the dynamic &quot;Kontrabarie,&quot; examining how a field drive would be more effective than the best chemical drive for rockets. These papers remained ambiguous on the fundamental concepts underlying his theory of the field drive, likely the calculations on the extra fields of his field theory remained unsolved. These calculations were only performed a few years later.

Heim stopped working on the propulsion aspect of his theory in 1959. He spent the remainder of his life devoted to refining the unified field attributes of his theory.

===1960s===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were a number of reports on Heim in magazines and tabloids such as &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, &quot;Bunte Illustrierte&quot;, &quot;Quick&quot; and &quot;Stern&quot;. The magazine &quot;le Figaro&quot; remarked, on 15 January 1969, that he was an &quot;inhuman robot&quot;. The German television station ARD ran reports and interviews with Heim. It was speculated that Heim was likely to make a breakthrough, either in fundamental physics or propulsion theory.

On 17 November 1969, Heim reported the progress he had made towards developing his unified field theory to Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB). Pascual Jordan and Gebhard Lyra were among the small body of scientists who attended that colloquium. Jordan wrote Heim a letter on 22 December 1969, encouraging him to publish his theory.

===1970s===
Ludwig Bölkow encouraged Heim to enhance his theory. On 25 November 1976, Heim publicly introduced, for the first time, his completed unified field theory in a presentation to MBB engineers. It included the methodology for calculating the mass spectrum of elementary particles. Pursuant to recommendations by Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s successor, Hans-Peter Dürr, Heim published his unified field theory summary the following year in an article entitled &quot;Recommendations of a Way to a Unified Description of Elementary Particles&quot; in the Max Planck Institute journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Naturforschung&quot; (Journal of Natural Research). This was the first publication of his theory in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

===1980s===
In 1982, Heim&#x27;s mass formula was programmed on a computer at the German Electron Synchrotron DESY in Hamburg with the assistance of some resident scientists. Up to that point, Heim had not yet confided in other theoretical physicists on the details of the mass formula derivation. Hence, the DESY results were not widely published and disseminated for academic scrutiny. That year Walter Dröscher, a theorist at the Vienna Patent Office, began to work with Heim. The first result of their collaboration culminated in the second volume of Heim&#x27;s major work, appearing in 1984.

===2000s===
Heim died in Northeim in 2001 at age 75.

In 2004, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) awarded the winning paper in the nuclear and future flight field to a retired Austrian patent officer named Walter Dröscher and Jochem Häuser, a physicist and professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany. They turned the theoretical framework of Burkhard Heim into a proposal for an experimental test for a propulsion device that is thought to theoretically be able to travel at rates faster than the speed of light. Hans Theodor Auerbach, a theoretical physicist and colleague of Heim has stated that, &quot;As far as I understand it, Heim theory is ingenious,&quot; and, &quot;I think that physics will take this direction in the future&quot;.

In 2008, the AIAA Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion Technical Committee published the following statement:

::Much research was conducted this year on the investigation of the experimental basis of the existence of gravity-like fields that cannot be described by conventional gravitation; that is, by the accumulation of mass. Investigations emphasized a geometrized approach termed Extended Heim Theory, which extends Einstein&#x27;s idea of geometrization of physics by employing the additional concepts of Heim.

==Life and health==
Heim had to undergo a series of at least 50 operations after a laboratory explosion that resulted in the loss of both of his hands. He had found that intense concentration on the study of Einstein&#x27;s relativity theory had helped him control the pain in his arms mentally and physically.

The loss of his hands and serious reduction of his eyesight apparently resulted in Heim acquiring an eidetic, acoustic memory. He was said to rarely forget a formula if he heard it recited, and he was said to be able to learn a language in a matter of days. He married a former concert singer from Prague in 1950 named Gerda.

== Heim theory and the physics community ==
Heim achieved some media renown in the 1950s and 1960s, but his ideas have never been well-accepted in the physics community. A significant portion of Heim&#x27;s work has not been published in rigorously peer-reviewed journals. Heim&#x27;s theory also predicts the existence of two hypothetical neutrinos, which have been shown not to exist by experiments at the Large Electron–Positron Collider.

<doc id="1157828" wikidata="Q54284" url="?curid=1157828" title="ROSAT">
<text>ROSAT (short for Röntgensatellit; in German X-rays are called Röntgenstrahlen, in honour of Wilhelm Röntgen) was a German Aerospace Center-led satellite X-ray telescope, with instruments built by West Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was launched on 1 June 1990, on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral, on what was initially designed as an 18-month mission, with provision for up to five years of operation. ROSAT operated for over eight years, finally shutting down on 12 February 1999.

In February 2011, it was reported that the satellite was unlikely to burn up entirely while re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere due to the large amount of ceramics and glass used in construction. Parts as heavy as could impact the surface. ROSAT eventually re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 23 October 2011 over the Bay of Bengal.

== Overview ==
The Roentgensatellit (ROSAT) was a joint German, U.S. and British X-ray astrophysics project. ROSAT carried a German-built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) with three focal plane instruments: two German Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) and the US-supplied High Resolution Imager (HRI). The X-ray mirror assembly was a grazing incidence four-fold nested Wolter I telescope with an 84-cm diameter aperture and 240-cm focal length. The angular resolution was less than 5 arcsecond at half energy width (the &quot;angle within which half of the electromagnetic radiation&quot; is focused). The XRT assembly was sensitive to X-rays between 0.1 and 2 keV (one thousand Electronvolt).

In addition, a British-supplied extreme ultraviolet (XUV) telescope, the Wide Field Camera (WFC), was coaligned with the XRT and covered the energy band from 0.042 to 0.21 keV (30 to 6 nm).

ROSAT&#x27;s unique strengths were high spatial resolution, low-background, soft X-ray imaging for the study of the structure of low surface brightness features, and for low-resolution spectroscopy.

The ROSAT spacecraft was a three-axis stabilized satellite which can be used for pointed observations, for slewing between targets, and for performing scanning observations on great circles perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. ROSAT was capable of fast slews (180 deg. in ~15 min.) which makes it possible to observe two targets on opposite hemispheres during each orbit. The pointing accuracy was 1 arcminute with stability less than 5 arcsec per sec and jitter radius of ~10 arcsec. Two CCD star sensors were used for optical position sensing of guide stars and attitude determination of the spacecraft. The post facto attitude determination accuracy was 6 arcsec.

The ROSAT mission was divided into two phases:
# After a two-month on-orbit calibration and verification period, an all-sky survey was performed for six months using the PSPC in the focus of XRT, and in two XUV bands using the WFC. The survey was carried out in the scan mode.
# The second phase consists of the remainder of the mission and was devoted to pointed observations of selected astrophysical sources. In ROSAT&#x27;s pointed phase, observing time was allocated to Guest Investigators from all three participating countries through peer review of submitted proposals. ROSAT had a design life of 18 months, but was expected to operate beyond its nominal lifetime.

== Instruments ==

=== X-ray Telescope (XRT) ===
The main assembly was a German-built imaging X-ray Telescope (XRT) with three focal plane instruments: two German Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC) and the US-supplied High Resolution Imager (HRI). The X-ray mirror assembly was a grazing incidence four-fold nested Wolter I telescope with an diameter aperture and focal length. The angular resolution was less than 5 arcsec at half energy width. The XRT assembly was sensitive to X-rays between 0.1 and 2 keV.

=== Position Sensitive Proportional Counters &quot;(two)&quot; (PSPC) ===
There are two Position Sensitive Proportional Counters (PSPC), PSPC-B and PSPC-C, mounted on a carousel within the focal plane turret of ROSAT. PSPC-C was intended to be the primary detector for the mission and was used for the bulk of the All-Sky Survey until it was destroyed during the AMCS glitch on 25 January 1991. After the glitch, PSPC-B was used for all further observations. Two more PSPCs(PSPC-A and PSPC-D) were mounted on ROSAT for ground calibration.

Each PSPC is a thin-window gas counter. Each incoming X-ray photon produces an electron cloud whose position and charge are detected using two wire grids. The photon position is determined with an accuracy of about 120 micrometers. The electron cloud&#x27;s charge corresponds to the photon energy, with a nominal spectral bandpass 0.1-2.4 keV.

=== High Resolution Imager (HRI) ===

The US-supplied High Resolution Imager used a crossed grid detector with a position accuracy to 25 micrometers. The instrument was damaged by solar exposure on 20 September 1998.

=== Wide Field Camera (WFC) ===

The Wide Field Camera (WFC) was a UK-supplied extreme ultraviolet (XUV) telescope co-aligned with the XRT and covered the wave band between 300 and 60 angstroms (0.042 to 0.21 keV).

== Launch ==
ROSAT was originally planned to be launched on the Space Shuttle but the Challenger disaster caused it to be moved to the Delta platform. This move made it impossible to recapture ROSAT with a Shuttle and bring it back to Earth.

== End of operations ==
Originally designed for a five-year mission, ROSAT continued in its extended mission for a further four years before equipment failure forced an end to the mission. For some months after this, ROSAT completed its very last observations before being finally switched off on 12 February 1999.

On 25 April 1998, failure of the primary star tracker on the X-ray Telescope led to pointing errors that in turn had caused solar overheating. A contingency plan and the necessary software had already been developed to utilise an alternative star tracker attached to the Wide Field Camera.

ROSAT was soon operational again, but with some restrictions to the effectiveness of its tracking and thus its control. It was severely damaged on 20 September 1998 when a reaction wheel in the spacecraft&#x27;s Attitude Measuring and Control System reached its maximum rotational speed, losing control of a slew, damaging the High Resolution Imager by exposure to the sun. This failure was initially attributed to the difficulties of controlling the satellite under these difficult circumstances outside its initial design parameters.

=== Allegations of cyber-attacks causing the failure ===
In 2008, NASA investigators were reported to have found that the ROSAT failure was linked to a cyber-intrusion at Goddard Space Flight Center. The root of this allegation is a 1999 advisory report by Thomas Talleur, senior investigator for cyber-security at NASA. This advisory is reported to describe a series of attacks from Russia that reached computers in the X-ray Astrophysics Section (i.e. ROSAT&#x27;s) at Goddard, and took control of computers used for the control of satellites, not just a passive &quot;snooping&quot; attack. The advisory stated: &quot;Hostile activities compromised [NASA] computer systems that directly and indirectly deal with the design, testing, and transferring of satellite package command-and-control codes.&quot;

The advisory is further reported as claiming that the ROSAT incident was &quot;coincident with the intrusion&quot; and that, &quot;Operational characteristics and commanding of the ROSAT were sufficiently similar to other space assets to provide intruders with valuable information about how such platforms are commanded,&quot;. Without public access to the advisory, it is obviously impossible to comment in detail. Even if it did describe a real intrusion, there is a plausible &quot;no attack&quot; explanation for ROSAT&#x27;s failure, and the report is claimed to link the two incidents as no more than &quot;coincident.&quot; However, NASA officials in charge of the day-to-day operations of the ROSAT mission at Goddard, including GSFC Rosat Project Scientist Rob Petre, say definitively that no such incident occurred. Talleur&#x27;s information appears to have come from one of his interns who exaggerated a hacking incident on an office computer not related to flight operations.

IT security remains a significant issue for NASA. Other systems including the Earth Observing System have also been attacked.

== Re-entry ==

In 1990, the satellite was put in an orbit at an altitude of and inclination of 53°. Due to atmospheric drag, the satellite slowly lost height until, in September 2011, the satellite was orbiting approximately above the Earth. On 23 October 2011 ROSAT re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere sometime between 1:45 UTC and 2:15 UTC over the Bay of Bengal, east of India. There was no confirmation if pieces of debris had reached the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Successor ==

eROSITA launched on board the Russian-German Spektr-RG space observatory in 2019. It will provide an updated all-sky survey of the X-ray sky, extending the energy range to 10keV, increase the sensitivity by a factor of 25 and improve the spatial and spectral resolution.

<doc id="1157830" wikidata="Q2439624" url="?curid=1157830" title="Selsey">
<text>Selsey () is a seaside town and civil parish, about eight miles (12 km) south of Chichester, in the Chichester district, in West Sussex, England. Selsey lies at the southernmost point of the Manhood Peninsula, almost cut off from mainland Sussex by the sea. It is bounded to the west by Bracklesham Bay, to the north by Broad Rife, to the east by Pagham Harbour and terminates in the south at Selsey Bill. There are significant rock formations beneath the sea off both of its coasts, named the Owers rocks and Mixon rocks. Coastal erosion has been an ever-present problem for Selsey. In 2011 the parish had a population of 10,737.

The B2145 is the only road in and out of the town crossing a bridge over the water inlet at Pagham Harbour at a point known as &quot;the ferry&quot;. At one time Selsey was inaccessible at flood tide, and a boat was stationed at the ferry to take horses and passengers to and from Sidlesham.

==Place name==
There are suggestions that the name &quot;Selsey&quot; originally meant &quot;Holy Island&quot; because of its connection with Saint Wilfrid. The Venerable Bede in his writings described the name &quot;Selsey&quot; as &quot;the Isle of Sea Calves&quot; (sea calves are better known as seals) hence &quot;Seal Island&quot;.

Edward Heron-Allen identified at least twenty different spellings of the place that we now know today as &quot;Selsey&quot;.

A selection of versions as identified by Heron-Allen are:

*&quot;Seoles&quot; – Old English
*&quot;Seleisi&quot; – Domesday Book 1086
*&quot;Celesye&quot; – Assize Roll 1279

==History==
===Palaeolithic===
The earliest evidence of human habitation in the Selsey area goes back to the Stone Age. Various stone implements have been found which date to the Palaeolithic period. People have been living in the area ever since.

===Classical Antiquity===

Towards the end of the first century B.C. the Atrebates possessed three large urban centres (known as oppida) that served as the tribal mints and possibly the king&#x27;s court. These were located near modern Silchester, Winchester and the Chichester-Selsey area. So far, in the Chichester-Selsey area, there is no archaeological evidence to confirm this, although various coins from the Atrebates rulers named Commius, Tincommius, Verica, Eppillus, and Cunobelin were found on Selsey beach in 1877, and it is thought that these coins would have been minted locally. The 17th century antiquarian William Camden, and others have posited that the Atrebates settlement was located at the Mixon rocks, now south of Selsey Bill. More recent hypotheses have suggested that the Chichester-Selsey &quot;oppidum&quot; was distributed across the region.

There is evidence of possible Roman activity in Selsey. The archaeologist Barry Cunliffe wrote that in the middle of the first century, the area provided a good base for the transfer of sea-borne goods and the storing and distributing of supplies to support their conquest of south west Britain. When this objective had been achieved the Romans moved their base to Chichester. The Mixon would have been part of the mainland, at the time of the Roman occupation and it is evident that they used its stone for building material.

===Early Middle Ages===
Some Anglo-Saxon gold fragments were found on the beach between Selsey and Bognor, these were dated as late 6th/ 8th century and what made them particularly interesting is that they had a runic inscription on them. The fragments were handed over to the British Museum.

The Anglo Saxon Chronicle records the legendary foundation of Sussex by Ælle and his sons when they landed near Selsey.

Stephen of Ripon and the Venerable Bede say that Wilfrid arrived in Selsey [about 680] and converted the Kingdom of the South Saxons to Christianity. Selsey Abbey stood at Selsey (probably where Church Norton is today), and was the cathedra for the Sussex Diocese until the Council of London ordered the removal of the See to Chichester in 1075, during the reign of William the Conqueror. In all there had been twenty-two Bishops of Selsey over a period of 370 years.

===High and Late Middle Ages===

In the Domesday Book &quot;Selesie&quot; is mentioned under the hundred of &quot;Somerley&quot;:

===Early modern===
The manor of Selsey remained in the Bishop of Chichesters hands until 1561, when it was taken over by the crown.

In July 1588 the Spanish Armada arrived off the Isle of Wight with the intention of attacking Portsmouth. The wind changed direction to the south-west. Men from the Manhood Peninsula serving under Francis Drake conceived a plan to lure the Spanish fleet onto the Owers rocks (off Selsey). However the Spanish Admiral, recognising the danger, decided to head for Calais.
In 1647, a fatality was recorded following a cricket match at Selsey when a fielder called Henry Brand was hit on the head by the batsman Thomas Latter, who was trying to hit the ball a second time. The incident repeated one at Horsted Keynes in 1624.

Over the centuries Selsey has derived an income from the sea, not all of it strictly legal. In the eighteenth century Selsey Bill was very much more isolated than it is today, and the sand spit extended farther out to sea. There was only the causeway connected to the mainland and that was covered at high tide. The approach of the local riding officer would have been conspicuous in the extreme. One of the enterprises was smuggling with many local people being involved in the lucrative trade. The Rectors of Selsey reputedly claimed a tithe on all kegs landed there, and stories also tell of a passageway leading from the Old Rectory (at Church Norton) to the remains of a Mound, thought to have been built by the Normans. The course of the tunnel was marked by a depression on the surface of the ground as late as 1911.

The legal export of wool trade had been established for centuries with Chichester being granted staple port status. However the Selsey area was notorious for the illegal export of wool, in a custom known as owling. During the 1720s one Selsey man ran a regular ferry service to France, travelling back and forth every five weeks, and other prominent Selsey figures made considerable fortunes just from part-time work in the free-trade.
In 1749 fourteen smugglers, members of the notorious Hawkhurst Gang, were accused of the murder of William Galley, a custom-house officer, and Daniel Chater, a shoemaker. A contemporary book written under the pseudonym &quot;A. Gentleman&quot; provides a narrative on the offence, capture, trial and execution of the smugglers involved. Seven were tried and condemned to death at Chichester assizes; one died in gaol before sentence could be carried out and the other six were hanged at the Broyle north of Chichester. Subsequently, the bodies of two of the smugglers, John Cobby and John Hammond, were hung in gibbets at Selsey Bill so that they could be seen at great distance from east and west.

===Modern===


At the beginning of the 19th century, Selsey opened its first school. In 1818 premises were granted to the Rector and churchwardens of Selsey which were &quot;on trust to permit the premises to be used for a schoolhouse or free school, for the gratuitous education of such poor children belonging to the Parish of Selsey as the said trustees or successors may think proper.&quot;The school was eventually taken over by the local authority in 1937.

Selsey was connected to Chichester from 1897 to 1935 by a rail link initially called the Hundred of Manhood and Selsey Tramway and later the West Sussex Railway. The light railway rolling stock was all second hand and not very reliable and the journey times lengthy. Various nicknames such as the &quot;Selsey Snail&quot; were attributed to the tram and comic postcards were issued reflecting its poor service.

In the late 1930s the Broadreeds Holiday camp, that was later to be run by Pontins, was used as a transit camp for girls coming on the Kindertransport. The woman appointed as second in command, Sophie Friedlaender describes in her memoir how she first arrived at the camp: 
By the time of World War II the Kindertransport had stopped; Broadreeds camp then continued to accept evacuees mainly from London. This was until August 1940 when during a bombing raid, three evacuees and one soldier were killed. All the evacuees were re-evacuated shortly after. Also, during World War II, large areas of the village were closed to the public, particularly as off shore at East Beach, there was secret(at the time) work on the Mulberry harbours. These were eventually towed to Normandy for D-Day.

A private aerodrome, situated at Church Norton, was requisitioned by the RAF in 1942, then in 1943 after some construction work, became an advanced landing ground (ALG) known as RAF Selsey. The airfield from Normandy, was built to support D-Day. It was decommissioned as an ALG shortly after D-Day, it then became a satellite of RAF Tangmere for a while and finally a reserve airfield for the remainder of the war.

Erosion by the sea and flooding has been a constant problem for Selsey. In the 1950s there was major work, to improve the sea walls and groynes, to protect against the winter storms. By the end of the 1980s, with the constant battering from the sea, a lot of the defences needed remedial work. In 2011 the Environment Agency started to build new sea defences between Selsey and Bracklesham, the scheme was described as managed realignment in that it involved the building of new defences inland from the coast and allowing a new &quot;intertidal area&quot; to form seaward of the new defences. &quot;Intertidal&quot; means the land that is exposed at low tide and covered by the sea at high tide. Then in 2013 the scheme was completed. The Environment Agency says that &quot;it will improve the standard of flood protection for over 300 homes, the water treatment works and the main road into Selsey. It will also create important new intertidal wildlife habitat and open up new footpaths, cycleways and bridleways.&quot;
==Selsey today==
===Commerce===
Selsey has a high street with a mix of shops and restaurants. There are many holiday cottages, bed and breakfasts as well as some very large static caravan parks that make Selsey a popular holiday destination. It also has a selection of light industries and a small fishing fleet.
===Sport and leisure===
====Football====
Selsey Football Club was formed in 1903 and moved to the High Street Ground in the late 1940s. The current Selsey F.C. is a semi-professional association football club and has been awarded Chartered Standard Community status. It is affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association.

====Selsey Cricket Club====

It is known that cricket has been played, in Selsey at least since 1647, although the earliest record for the Selsey Cricket Club was on 9 July 1834 when the team played Kingley Vale. Selsey won by 3 runs.

A former president was Hubert Doggart, OBE, MA. He was the son of the sportsman Graham Doggart who rose to chair the Football Association. Doggart represented England in two Test matches in 1950. He was President of the M.C.C. (1981–1982), the Cricket Council (1981–1982) and the Cricket Society (1983–1998), and he chaired the Friends of Arundel Castle Cricket Club (1993–2003). In the 1970s he played occasionally for Selsey C.C.

Selsey are a Clubmark Club running two men&#x27;s League sides, one Ladies League side, several Junior sides and Sunday and Midweek Friendly sides.

====Selsey Arts====

The wide landscapes, exposed coastal location and diverse birdlife lure artists to Selsey, many of whom belong to Arts Dream Selsey Artists. The society holds regular exhibitions and events.

The list of artists, who have featured Selsey in their work, include Whistler and J. M. W. Turner.

====Holiday Park====
On the west side of the town is the Seal Bay holiday park.
==Education==

Selsey has a secondary school called the Selsey Academy (formerly known as Manhood Community College up till September 2011) and two primary schools, Seal Primary School (now known as Seal Academy) and Medmerry Primary School.
Before and after the Second World War there were several private preparatory schools in Selsey including Broombank School housed in the former residence of the music hall entertainer Bransby Williams next to the Selsey Hotel. The owner/headmaster from the early 1950s until the school&#x27;s closure in 1969 was William Percy Higgs (died Bristol 1986), a former Cambridge University organ scholar and music master at Eton. Higgs made Broombank a music and arts school attracting the children of well known actors, artists and musicians as well as temporary pupils from France, whose numbers occasionally matched those of the British children.
==RNLI Selsey Lifeboat==

Selsey had an RNLI lifeboat station and shop on Kingsway, east of Selsey Bill. The station was established in 1861. In 2014 Selsey had a Tyne-class lifeboat and a D Class Inshore Lifeboat which had its own boat house just off the beach. In 2011 Selsey Lifeboat Station celebrated 150 years during which period lifeboat crew have received 10 awards for gallantry.

A new boathouse, to replace the old off shore boathouse, was constructed on shore. The final launch from the old boathouse was made on 1 April 2017 and the old boathouse itself was demolished during the Summer of 2017. The new boathouse accommodates both the inshore lifeboat and the new Shannon-class lifeboat, which has been allocated to Selsey, to replace the Tyne class. The RNLI shop has also been transferred to the new building.
==Landmarks==
The parish has a couple of Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Bracklesham Bay runs along the coastline of the parish.

Medmerry Mill is a grade II listed tower windmill restored in the 1960s and currently in use as a gift shop.

St Peter&#x27;s Church, a grade II listed building, is the parish church and dates from the 13th century. The church building was originally situated at the location of St Wilfrid&#x27;s first monastery and cathedral at Church Norton some north of the present centre of population. It was moved from there in the 19th century and is now situated at the entrance to Selsey High Street.When the removed church was re-consecrated in April 1866, due to an oversight it was not consecrated properly to carry out marriages. The omission was not discovered until 1904, by which time 196 marriage services had taken place. These services although canonically correct were not strictly legal. To rectify the situation an Act of Parliament was required. In 1906 an order was made to finally validate all the marriages celebrated between 12 April 1866 and 25 February 1904.

==Notable residents==


* Eric Coates (1886–1957) – The composer lived and worked in Selsey. He was inspired to write &quot;By the Sleepy Lagoon&quot; after overlooking the sea towards Bognor Regis. His musical composition can be heard as the theme tune to &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on BBC Radio 4.
*Air Commodore Edward &#x27;Teddy&#x27; Mortlock Donaldson (1912–1992) who set a new world air speed record of 616 mph in September 1946, in the Star Meteor IV. Donaldson lived at Iron Latch Cottage and there is a blue plaque on the beach at the bottom of Park Lane to mark the event. Donaldson has a second plaque at No. 86, Grafton Road.
*Edward Heron-Allen (1861–1943): Selsey&#x27;s most distinguished resident in the early 20th century, Mr Heron-Allen made an enormous contribution to village life and today is still well known as the author of the classic work on local history for the area.

During the 1930s, the Pavilion Theatre, in the High Street, witnessed several stagings of Journey&#x27;s End. Sherriff attended a rehearsal and advised the cast before his departure to Hollywood.When his mother died in 1965, her ashes were interred in the wall of St Wilfrid’s Chapel, in Church Norton.

==Cultural references==

Selsey Bill is referenced in the song &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Kids&quot; by The Jam (from the 1979 album &quot;Setting Sons&quot;), along with Bracklesham Bay, as a place where these working-class children take holiday with their families; &quot;Save up their money for a holiday/To Selsey Bill, or Bracklesham Bay.&quot;

Selsey is also mentioned in Ben Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Volpone&quot; in Act 2 Scene 1 with reference to &#x27;Selsey cockles&#x27;
In the opening scene of the Lerner and Loewe 1956 musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Professor Higgins correctly identifies one of the characters as coming from Selsey.

Selsey is further referenced in the Madness song &quot;Driving in My Car&quot;: &quot;I drive up to Muswell Hill, I&#x27;ve even been to Selsey Bill&quot;.

==Climate==

Selsey&#x27;s climate is classified as warm and temperate. Although Selsey is in one of the sunnier areas of the UK, there is rainfall throughout the year and even the driest month still has rain.Probably the most problematic climatic hazard is wind. The town is situated in an area where tornadoes and waterspouts are common. A tornado in 1986 damaged 200 houses and cut a swathe 70 metres wide. Another tornado in 1998 left an estimated £10m of destruction and damaged the late Patrick Moore&#x27;s observatory.

A study published by Princeton University and McGill University, in 2020, concluded that the Manhood Peninsula is at particularly high risk of flooding as its topography is less than above the current mean sea level and that by 2100 Selsey will be subject to permanent inundation.

To mitigate flood risk, Chichester District Council has adopted the &quot;Pagham to East Head Coastal Defence Strategy (2009)&quot;. This strategy describes a &quot;Hold the line&quot; policy for Selsey that will keep the coastline in the same place by maintaining sea defences. However, the Strategy cautions what it calls &quot;funding challenges&quot; that could impact the work needed. 

==Nature==
In 2015, around 50 smooth-hound sharks were observed near the beach at Selsey.

The Pagham Harbour Nature Reserve, operated by the RSPB, is close to Selsey. It is possible to see a variety of bird species including Dark-bellied Brent Geese, Wigeon, Black-headed Gulls, Common, Sandwich and Little Terns.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The B2145 Chichester road, is the only road in and out of the town crossing a bridge over the water inlet at Pagham Harbour at a point known as &quot;the ferry&quot;.

===Buses===
The Stagecoach South 51 bus route runs from Chichester bus station to Selsey. Buses alternate between terminating at West Sands Caravan Park and Seal Road. The Selsey Community Shuttle Bus, operated by Selsey Town council, covers the outlying areas of the town, bringing people into the centre of Selsey to shop, attend the doctors&#x27; or dentists&#x27; surgeries, or to catch the Stagecoach bus into Chichester.

===Selsey Venture Club===
The Selsey Venture Club operate a voluntary minibus transport for elderly/ infirm residents to encourage them to take part in local community activities.

===Airports and train stations===

The nearest airport is at Southampton followed by those at Gatwick, Bournemouth and Heathrow.

Selsey is no longer connected to the national railway system. The train line between Chichester and Selsey closed in 1935. The nearest rail stations are Chichester and Bognor.

<text>Data security means protecting digital data, such as those in a database, from destructive forces and from the unwanted actions of unauthorized users, such as a cyberattack or a data breach.

== Technologies ==

=== Disk encryption ===

Disk encryption refers to encryption technology that encrypts data on a hard disk drive.  Disk encryption typically takes form in either software (see disk encryption software) or hardware (see disk encryption hardware). Disk encryption is often referred to as on-the-fly encryption (OTFE) or transparent encryption.

=== Software versus hardware-based mechanisms for protecting data ===

Software-based security solutions encrypt the data to protect it from theft. However, a malicious program or a hacker could corrupt the data to make it unrecoverable, making the system unusable. Hardware-based security solutions prevent read and write access to data, which provides very strong protection against tampering and unauthorized access.

Hardware-based security or assisted computer security offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Security tokens such as those using PKCS#11 or a mobile phone may be more secure due to the physical access required in order to be compromised. Access is enabled only when the token is connected and the correct PIN is entered (see two-factor authentication). However, dongles can be used by anyone who can gain physical access to it. Newer technologies in hardware-based security solve this problem by offering full proof of security for data.

Working off hardware-based security: A hardware device allows a user to log in, log out and set different levels through manual actions. The device uses biometric technology to prevent malicious users from logging in, logging out, and changing privilege levels. The current state of a user of the device is read by controllers in peripheral devices such as hard disks. Illegal access by a malicious user or a malicious program is interrupted based on the current state of a user by hard disk and DVD controllers making illegal access to data impossible. Hardware-based access control is more secure than the protection provided by the operating systems as operating systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks by viruses and hackers. The data on hard disks can be corrupted after malicious access is obtained. With hardware-based protection, the software cannot manipulate the user privilege levels. A hacker or a malicious program cannot gain access to secure data protected by hardware or perform unauthorized privileged operations. This assumption is broken only if the hardware itself is malicious or contains a backdoor. The hardware protects the operating system image and file system privileges from being tampered with. Therefore, a completely secure system can be created using a combination of hardware-based security and secure system administration policies.

=== Backups ===

Backups are used to ensure data that is lost can be recovered from another source. It is considered essential to keep a backup of any data in most industries and the process is recommended for any files of importance to a user.

===Data masking===

Data masking of structured data is the process of obscuring (masking) specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel. This may include masking the data from users (for example so banking customer representatives can only see the last four digits of a customer&#x27;s national identity number), developers (who need real production data to test new software releases but should not be able to see sensitive financial data), outsourcing vendors, etc.

===Data erasure===

Data erasure is a method of software-based overwriting that completely wipes all electronic data residing on a hard drive or other digital media to ensure that no sensitive data is lost when an asset is retired or reused.
== International laws and standards ==

=== International laws ===

In the UK, the Data Protection Act is used to ensure that personal data is accessible to those whom it concerns, and provides redress to individuals if there are inaccuracies. This is particularly important to ensure individuals are treated fairly, for example for credit checking purposes. The Data Protection Act states that only individuals and companies with legitimate and lawful reasons can process personal information and cannot be shared. Data Privacy Day is an international holiday started by the Council of Europe that occurs every January 28. 
Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) became law on May 25, 2018, organizations may face significant penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of their annual revenue if they do not comply with the regulation. It is intended that GDPR will force organizations to understand their data privacy risks and take the appropriate measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure of consumers’ private information.
=== International standards ===

The international standards ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27002:2013 cover data security under the topic of information security, and one of its cardinal principles is that all stored information, i.e. data, should be owned so that it is clear whose responsibility it is to protect and control access to that data. The following are examples of organizations that help strengthen and standardize computing security:

The Trusted Computing Group is an organization that helps standardize computing security technologies.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary international information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, automated teller machines, and point of sale cards.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) proposed by the European Commission will strengthen and unify data protection for individuals within the EU, whilst addressing the export of personal data outside the EU.

== Safeguards ==
The four types of technical safeguards are access controls, flow controls, inference controls, and data encryption. Access controls manage user entry and data manipulation, while flow controls regulate data dissemination. Inference controls prevent deduction of confidential information from statistical databases and data encryption prevents unauthorized access to confidential information.

<doc id="1157834" wikidata="Q985290" url="?curid=1157834" title="Meiji-mura">
<text>is an open-air architectural museum/theme park in Inuyama, near Nagoya in Aichi prefecture, Japan. It was opened on March 18, 1965. The museum preserves historic buildings from Japan&#x27;s Meiji (1867–1912), Taishō (1912–1926), and early Shōwa (1926–1945) periods. Over 60 historical buildings have been moved and reconstructed onto of rolling hills alongside Lake Iruka. The most noteworthy building there is the reconstructed main entrance and lobby of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s landmark Imperial Hotel, which originally stood in Tokyo from 1923 to 1967, when the main structure was demolished to make way for a new, larger version of the hotel.

== History ==
The Meiji era was a period of rapid change in Japan. After centuries of isolation, Japan began to incorporate ideas from the west, including building styles and construction techniques.

Meiji-mura was started by Yoshirō Taniguchi (谷口 吉郎 Taniguchi Yoshirō 1904–79), an architect, and Motoo Tsuchikawa (土川元夫 Tsuchikawa Moto-o, 1903–74), then vice president and later president of Nagoya Railroad (Meitetsu). While riding the Yamanote line in Tokyo, Taniguchi lamented the sight of the demolition of the Rokumeikan, a symbol of Meiji era architecture. He appealed to his college classmate Tsuchikawa to join him in working to preserve western style Meiji era buildings of cultural or historical importance. On July 16, 1962 they formed a foundation for this purpose, with Nagoya Railroad providing the funding. Meiji-mura was opened on March 18, 1965 on the banks of the Lake Iruka reservoir, operated under Nagoya Railroad with Taniguchi as museum director, with 15 buildings.

Meiji-mura&#x27;s goal is to preserve these historic early examples of western architecture mixed with Japanese construction techniques and materials. Incidentally, many of the buildings were saved from demolition during the post World War II period, another time of transition and rapid progress in Japanese history.

Though it is still operated by Nagoya Railroad, a subsidiary company was created in 2003 to oversee it and nearby Little World. Due to the recent financial declines with Nagoya Railroad the future of the park is in question. While renovations had been put on hold for a time, work on moving the Shibakawa Yashiki from Nishinomiya, Hyōgo was begun in January 2005.

== Buildings ==
Notable buildings of historical or cultural importance including those of later eras are preserved, including a few Japanese style buildings. Eleven of the buildings are designated as Important Cultural Assets, and nearly all the rest are registered as tangible cultural assets. The museum includes buildings from Hawaii and Seattle in the United States, and also Brazil. A steam locomotive and street car, along with shuttle buses and horse-drawn carriages, provide transportation within the grounds. An operational historic post office is included among the 67 buildings (as of 2005). Though some buildings are somewhat empty, others have displays showing the history of the building and period, period furniture, and other displays.

The entrance and lobby of the Imperial Hotel was saved and moved from Tokyo between 1967 and 1985. Though only the entrance and lobby remain, it is the largest structure in Meiji Mura.

Other structures preserved at Meiji Mura include Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s summer house from Shizuoka (1868), St. John&#x27;s Church from Kyoto (1907) designed by James McDonald Gardiner and Kyoto&#x27;s old St. Francis Xavier Catholic Cathedral (1890). The former cathedral is available to rent for weddings.

One of the traditional merchant houses that survived from Nagoya is the Tōmatsu House (東松家住宅, &quot;Tōmatsu-ka jūtaku&quot;), which was constructed in 1901 in Funairi-chō, Nagoya. It survived the bombing of Nagoya in World War II and was relocated to the museum in the 1970s. It has been designated by the government as an Important Cultural Property.

== Railway preservation ==

The village has been active in preserving locomotives and trams from the Meiji era in working condition. Two steam locomotives are used to haul three Meiji-built carriages as a means of transport within the village: No.12, a JGR Class 160 imported from England in 1874, and No.9, a locomotive imported from the US in 1913 that operated on the Minobu line.

== Village chiefs ==
Famous Japanese actors have served as honorary village chief.

However, it is often subdivided into the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS), West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS), and Antarctic Peninsula (AP), due to the large differences in topography, ice flow, and glacier mass balance between the three regions.

Because the East Antarctic ice sheet is over 10 times larger than the West Antarctic ice sheet and located at a higher elevation, it is less vulnerable to climate change than the WAIS. In the 20th century, EAIS had been one of the only places on Earth which displayed limited cooling instead of warming, even as the WAIS warmed by over 0.1 °C/decade from 1950s to 2000, with an average warming trend of &gt;0.05 °C/decade since 1957 across the whole continent. As of early 2020s, there is still net mass gain over the EAIS (due to increased precipitation freezing on top of the ice sheet), yet the ice loss from the WAIS glaciers such as Thwaites and Pine Island Glacier is far greater.

By 2100, net ice loss from Antarctica alone would add around to the global sea level rise. Further, the way WAIS is located deep below the sea level leaves it vulnerable to marine ice sheet instability, which is difficult to simulate in ice sheet models. If instability is triggered before 2100, it has the potential to increase total sea level rise caused by Antarctica by tens of centimeters more, particularly with high overall warming. Ice loss from Antarctica also generates fresh meltwater, at a rate of 1100–1500 billion tons (GT) per year. This meltwater dilutes the saline Antarctic bottom water, which weakens the lower cell of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation and may even contribute to its collapse, although this will likely take place over multiple centuries.

Paleoclimate research and improved modelling show that the West Antarctic ice sheet is very likely to disappear even if the warming does not progress any further, and only reducing the warming to below the temperature of 2020 may save it. It is believed that the loss of the ice sheet would take between 2,000 and 13,000 years, although several centuries of high emissions may shorten this to 500 years. of sea level rise would occur if the ice sheet collapses but leaves ice caps on the mountains behind, and if those melt as well. Isostatic rebound may also add around to the global sea levels over another 1,000 years. On the other hand, the East Antarctic ice sheet is far more stable and may only cause - of sea level rise from the current level of warming, which is a small fraction of the contained in the full ice sheet. Around , vulnerable locations like Wilkes Basin and Aurora Basin may collapse over a period of around 2,000 years, which would add up to to sea levels. The loss of the entire ice sheet would require global warming in a range between and , and a minimum of 10,000 years.

== Geography ==
The Antarctic ice sheet covers an area of almost and contains of ice. A cubic kilometer of ice weighs approximately 0.92 metric gigatonnes, meaning that the ice sheet weighs about 24,380,000 gigatonnes. This ice is equivalent to around 61% of all fresh water on Earth. 
The only other currently existing ice sheet on Earth is the Greenland ice sheet in the Arctic.

The Antarctic ice sheet is divided by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal sections called the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Some glaciologists consider ice cover over the relatively small Antarctic Peninsula (also in West Antarctica) to be the third ice sheet in Antarctica, in part because its drainage basins are very distinct from the WAIS. Collectively, these ice sheets have an average thickness of around , Even the Transantarctic Mountains are largely covered by ice, with only some mountain summits and the McMurdo Dry Valleys being ice-free in the present. Some coastal areas also have exposed bedrock that is not covered by ice. During the Late Cenozoic Ice Age, many of those areas had been covered by ice as well.

The EAIS rests on a major land mass, but the bed of the WAIS is, in places, more than below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea. Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier are the two most important outlet glaciers.

==== Weakening Antarctic circulation ====

Ice loss from Antarctica also generates more fresh meltwater, at a rate of 1100–1500 billion tons (GT) per year. This meltwater then mixes back into the Southern Ocean, which makes its water fresher. This freshening of the Southern Ocean results in increased stratification and stabilization of its layers, and this has the single largest impact on the long-term properties of Southern Ocean circulation. These changes in the Southern Ocean cause the upper cell circulation to speed up, accelerating the flow of major currents, while the lower cell circulation slows down, as it is dependent on the highly saline Antarctic bottom water, which already appears to have been observably weakened by the freshening, in spite of the limited recovery during 2010s. Since the 1970s, the upper cell has strengthened by 3–4 sverdrup (Sv; represents a flow of 1 million cubic meters per second), or 50–60% of its flow, while the lower cell has weakened by a similar amount, but because of its larger volume, these changes represent a 10–20% weakening.

While these effects weren&#x27;t fully caused by climate change, with some role played by the natural cycle of Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, they are likely to worsen in the future. As of early 2020s, climate models&#x27; best, limited-confidence estimate is that the lower cell would continue to weaken, while the upper cell may strengthen by around 20% over the 21st century. A key reason for the uncertainty is limited certainty about future ice loss from Antarctica and the poor and inconsistent representation of ocean stratification in even the CMIP6 models - the most advanced generation available as of early 2020s. One study suggests that the circulation would lose half its strength by 2050 under the worst climate change scenario, with greater losses occurring afterwards.

It is possible that the South Ocean overturning circulation may not simply continue to weaken in response to increased warming and freshening, but will eventually collapse outright, in a way which would be difficult to reverse and constitute an example of tipping points in the climate system. This would be similar to some projections for Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is also affected by the ocean warming and by meltwater flows from the declining Greenland ice sheet. However, Southern Hemisphere is only inhabited by 10% of the world&#x27;s population, and the Southern Ocean overturning circulation has historically received much less attention than the AMOC. Some preliminary research suggests that such a collapse may become likely once global warming reaches levels between and , but there is far less certainty than with the estimates for most other tipping points in the climate system. Even if initiated in the near future, the circulation&#x27;s collapse is unlikely to be complete until close to 2300, Similarly, impacts such as the reduction in precipitation in the Southern Hemisphere, with a corresponding increase in the North, or a decline of fisheries in the Southern Ocean with a potential collapse of certain marine ecosystems, are also expected to unfold over multiple centuries.

=== Long-term future ===


==Situation during geologic time scales==
The icing of Antarctica began in the Late Palaeocene or middle Eocene between 60 and 45.5 million years ago and escalated during the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago. CO2 levels were then about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of 600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation. The glaciation was favored by an interval when the Earth&#x27;s orbit favored cool summers but oxygen isotope ratio cycle marker changes were too large to be explained by Antarctic ice-sheet growth alone indicating an ice age of some size. The opening of the Drake Passage may have played a role as well though models of the changes suggest declining CO2 levels to have been more important.

The Western Antarctic ice sheet declined somewhat during the warm early Pliocene epoch, approximately five to three million years ago; during this time the Ross Sea opened up. But there was no significant decline in the land-based Eastern Antarctic ice sheet.

<doc id="1157842" wikidata="Q2372257" url="?curid=1157842" title="Hasse–Weil zeta function">
<text>In mathematics, the Hasse–Weil zeta function attached to an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; defined over an algebraic number field &quot;K&quot; is a meromorphic function on the complex plane defined in terms of the number of points on the variety after reducing modulo each prime number &quot;p&quot;. It is a global &quot;L&quot;-function defined as an Euler product of local zeta functions.

Hasse–Weil &quot;L&quot;-functions form one of the two major classes of global &quot;L&quot;-functions, alongside the &quot;L&quot;-functions associated to automorphic representations. Conjecturally, these two types of global &quot;L&quot;-functions are actually two descriptions of the same type of global &quot;L&quot;-function; this would be a vast generalisation of the Taniyama-Weil conjecture, itself an important result in number theory.

For an elliptic curve over a number field &quot;K&quot;, the Hasse–Weil zeta function is conjecturally related to the group of rational points of the elliptic curve over &quot;K&quot; by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

==Definition==

The description of the Hasse–Weil zeta function &quot;up to finitely many factors of its Euler product&quot; is relatively simple. This follows the initial suggestions of Helmut Hasse and André Weil, motivated by the Riemann zeta function, which results from the case when &quot;V&quot; is a single point.

Taking the case of &quot;K&quot; the rational number field formula_1, and &quot;V&quot; a non-singular projective variety, we can for almost all prime numbers &quot;p&quot; consider the reduction of &quot;V&quot; modulo &quot;p&quot;, an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot;&quot;p&quot; over the finite field formula_2 with &quot;p&quot; elements, just by reducing equations for &quot;V&quot;. Scheme-theoretically, this reduction is just the pullback of the Néron model of &quot;V&quot; along the canonical map Spec formula_2 → Spec formula_4. Again for almost all &quot;p&quot; it will be non-singular. We define a Dirichlet series of the complex variable &quot;s&quot;,

:formula_5

which is the infinite product of the local zeta functions

: formula_6

where &quot;Nk&quot; is the number of points of &quot;V&quot; defined over the finite field extension formula_7 of formula_2.

This formula_9 is well-defined only up to multiplication by rational functions in formula_10 for finitely many primes &quot;p&quot;.

Since the indeterminacy is relatively harmless, and has meromorphic continuation everywhere, there is a sense in which the properties of &quot;Z(s)&quot; do not essentially depend on it. In particular, while the exact form of the functional equation for &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), reflecting in a vertical line in the complex plane, will definitely depend on the &#x27;missing&#x27; factors, the existence of some such functional equation does not.

A more refined definition became possible with the development of étale cohomology; this neatly explains what to do about the missing, &#x27;bad reduction&#x27; factors. According to general principles visible in ramification theory, &#x27;bad&#x27; primes carry good information (theory of the &quot;conductor&quot;). This manifests itself in the étale theory in the Ogg–Néron–Shafarevich criterion for good reduction; namely that there is good reduction, in a definite sense, at all primes &quot;p&quot; for which the Galois representation ρ on the étale cohomology groups of &quot;V&quot; is &quot;unramified&quot;. For those, the definition of local zeta function can be recovered in terms of the characteristic polynomial of

:formula_11

Frob(&quot;p&quot;) being a Frobenius element for &quot;p&quot;. What happens at the ramified &quot;p&quot; is that ρ is non-trivial on the inertia group &quot;I&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) for &quot;p&quot;. At those primes the definition must be &#x27;corrected&#x27;, taking the largest quotient of the representation ρ on which the inertia group acts by the trivial representation. With this refinement, the definition of &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) can be upgraded successfully from &#x27;almost all&#x27; &quot;p&quot; to &quot;all&quot; &quot;p&quot; participating in the Euler product. The consequences for the functional equation were worked out by Serre and Deligne in the later 1960s; the functional equation itself has not been proved in general.

==Hasse–Weil conjecture==

The Hasse–Weil conjecture states that the Hasse–Weil zeta function should extend to a meromorphic function for all complex &quot;s&quot;, and should satisfy a functional equation similar to that of the Riemann zeta function. For elliptic curves over the rational numbers, the Hasse–Weil conjecture follows from the modularity theorem: each elliptic curve over formula_12 is modular.

==Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture==
The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture states that the rank of the abelian group &quot;E&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of points of an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; is the order of the zero of the Hasse–Weil &quot;L&quot;-function &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = 1, and that the first non-zero coefficient in the Taylor expansion of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) at &quot;s&quot; = 1 is given by more refined arithmetic data attached to &quot;E&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. The conjecture is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which has offered a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct proof.

==Elliptic curves over Q==
An elliptic curve is a specific type of variety. Let &quot;E&quot; be an elliptic curve over Q of conductor &quot;N&quot;. Then, &quot;E&quot; has good reduction at all primes &quot;p&quot; not dividing &quot;N&quot;, it has multiplicative reduction at the primes &quot;p&quot; that &quot;exactly&quot; divide &quot;N&quot; (i.e. such that &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;N&quot;, but &quot;p&quot;2 does not; this is written &quot;p&quot; || &quot;N&quot;), and it has additive reduction elsewhere (i.e. at the primes where &quot;p&quot;2 divides &quot;N&quot;). The Hasse–Weil zeta function of &quot;E&quot; then takes the form

:formula_13

Here, ζ(&quot;s&quot;) is the usual Riemann zeta function and &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;s&quot;) is called the &quot;L&quot;-function of &quot;E&quot;/Q, which takes the form

:formula_14

where, for a given prime &quot;p&quot;,

:formula_15

where in the case of good reduction &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; is &quot;p&quot; + 1 − (number of points of &quot;E&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;), and in the case of multiplicative reduction &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; is ±1 depending on whether &quot;E&quot; has split (plus sign) or non-split (minus sign) multiplicative reduction at &quot;p&quot;. A multiplicative reduction of curve &quot;E&quot; by the prime &quot;p&quot; is said to be split if -c6 is a square in the finite field with p elements.

There is a useful relation not using the conductor:

# If &quot;p&quot; doesn&#x27;t divide formula_16 (where formula_16 is the discriminant of the elliptic curve) then &quot;E&quot; has good reduction at &quot;p&quot;.
# If &quot;p&quot; divides formula_16 but not formula_19 then &quot;E&quot; has multiplicative bad reduction at &quot;p&quot;.
# If &quot;p&quot; divides both formula_16 and formula_19 then &quot;E&quot; has additive bad reduction at &quot;p&quot;.

<doc id="1157843" wikidata="Q417597" url="?curid=1157843" title="Procainamide">
<text>Procainamide (PCA) is a medication of the antiarrhythmic class used for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. It is a sodium channel blocker of cardiomyocytes; thus it is classified by the Vaughan Williams classification system as class Ia. In addition to blocking the &quot;I&quot;Na current, it inhibits the &quot;I&quot;Kr rectifier K+ current. Procainamide is also known to induce a voltage-dependent open channel block on the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels in cardiomyocytes.

==Uses==
===Medical===
Procainamide is used for treating ventricular arrhythmias: ventricular ectopy and tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, and re-entrant and automatic supraventricular tachycardia. For example, it can be used to convert new-onset atrial fibrillation, and although was initially thought to be suboptimal for this purpose, a growing body of literature is amounting in support for this exact cause.

It is administered by mouth, by intramuscular injection, or intravenously.

===Others===
It has also been used as a chromatography resin because it somewhat binds protein.

==Side effects==
There are many side effects following the induction of procainamide. These adverse effects are ventricular dysrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension and shock. The adverse effects occur even more often if the daily doses are increased. Procainamide may also lead to drug fever and other allergic responses. There is also a chance that drug-induced lupus erythematosus occurs, which at the same time leads to arthralgia, myalgia and pleurisy. Most of these side effects may occur due to the acetylation of procainamide.

===Toxicity===
There is a close line between the plasma concentrations of the therapeutic and toxic effect, therefore a high risk for toxicity. Many symptoms resemble systemic lupus erythematosus because procainamide reactivates hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites, which bind to histone proteins and are toxic to lymphocytes. The hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites are also toxic to bone marrow cells and can cause agranulocytosis. These metabolites are formed due to the activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These leukocytes release myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide, which oxidize the primary aromatic amine of procainamide to form procainamide hydroxylamine. The release of hydrogen peroxide is also called a respiratory burst, which occurs for procainamide in monocytes but not in lymphocytes. Furthermore, the metabolites can be formed by activated neutrophils. These metabolites could then bind to their cell membranes and cause a release of autoantibodies which would react with the neutrophils. Procainamide hydroxylamine has more cytotoxicity by hindering the response of lymphocytes to T-cell and B-cell mitogens. Hydroxylamine can also generate methemoglobin, a protein that could hinder further oxygen exchange.

It was also detected that the antiarrhythmic drug procainamide interferes with pacemakers. A toxic level of procainamide leads to decrease in ventricular conduction velocity and increase of the ventricular refractory period. This results in a disturbance in the artificial membrane potential and leads to a supraventricular tachycardia which induces failure of the pacemaker and death. Thus, it prolongs QT interval of action potential and increases the risk of torsade de pointes.

Procainamide could initiate leukopenia and/or agranulocytosis, which are serious hematologic disorders, and is also known for causing gastrointestinal disturbances and aggravating pre-existing abnormalities in impulse initiation and propagation.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Procainamide works as an anti-arrhythmic agent and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmia. It induces rapid block of the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels of the heart muscle and acts as antagonist to long-gating closures. The block is voltage-dependent and can occur from both sides; either from the intracellular or the extracellular side. Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. Procainamide is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result from the loss of voltage dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, procainamide has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of procainamide, the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking is determined by the membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels. Procainamide slows the conduction velocity and increases the refractory period, such that the maximal rate of depolarization is reduced. It is also said to be a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor antagonist.

===Metabolism===
Procainamide is metabolized via different pathways. The most common one is the acetylation of procainamide to the less-toxic N-acetylprocainamide. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. There are two phenotypes that result from the acetylation process, namely the slow and rapid acetylator. Procainamide can also be oxidized by the cytochrome P-450 to a reactive oxide metabolite. But it seems that acetylation of the nitrogen group of procainamide decrease the amount of the chemical that would be available for the oxidative route. Other metabolites of procainamide include desethyl-N-acetylprocainamide, desethylprocainamide, p-aminobenzoic acid, which are excreted via the urine. N-acetyl-4-aminobenzoic acid as well as N-acetyl-3-hydroxyprocainamide, N-acetylprocainamide-N-oxide and N-acetyl-4-aminohippuric acid are also metabolites of procainamide.

==Chemistry==
4-amino-N-2-(diethylamino)ethyl-benzamide (also known as para-amino-N-2-(diethylamino)ethyl-benzamide because the amino substituent is attached to the para-position, Arene substitution patterns of the benzene ring) is a synthetic organic compound with the chemical formula C13-H21-N3-O.

Procainamide is structurally similar to procaine, but in place of an ester group, procainamide contains an amide group. This substitution is the reason why procainamide exhibits a longer half-life time than procaine.

Procainamide belongs to the aminobenzamides. These are aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives consisting of an amide with a benzamide moiety and a triethylamine attached to the amide nitrogen.

In certain lines, the &quot;para&quot;-amino group might become a target site to attach further paraphernalia, e.g. &quot;ref.&quot; Ex18 in .

==History==
Procainamide was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950, under the brand name &quot;Pronestyl&quot;. It was launched by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1951.
Due to the loss of Indonesia in World War II, the source for cinchona alkaloids, a precursor of quinidine, was reduced. This led to research for a new antiarrhythmic drug. As a result, procaine was discovered, which has similar cardiac effects as quinidine. In 1936 it was found by Mautz that by applying it directly on the myocardium, the ventricular threshold for electrical stimulation was elevated. This mechanism is responsible for the antiarrhythmic effect. However, due to the short duration of action, caused by rapid enzymatic hydrolysis, its therapeutic applications were limited. In addition, procaine also caused tremors and respiratory depression. All these adverse features stimulated the search for an alternative to procaine. Studies were done on various congeners and metabolites and this ultimately led to the discovery of procainamide by Mark &quot;et al&quot;. It was found that procainamide was effective for treating ventricular arrhythmias, but it had the same toxicity profile as quinidine, and it could cause systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. These negative characteristics slowed the search for new antiarrhythmics based on the chemical structure of procainamide. In 1970 only five drugs were reported. These were the cardiac glycosides, quinidine, propranolol, lidocaine and diphenylhydantoin. In January 1996, extended release procainamide hydrochloride (Procanbid extended-release tablets) was approved by the FDA.

<text>Bellis perennis (), the daisy, is a European species of the family Asteraceae, often considered the archetypal species of the name &quot;daisy&quot;. To distinguish this species from other plants known as daisies, it is sometimes qualified or known as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy.

==Description==
&quot;Bellis perennis&quot; is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to in height. It has short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing, hence the term &#x27;lawn daisy&#x27;. It blooms from March to September and exhibits the phenomenon of heliotropism, in which the flowers follow the position of the sun in the sky.

The flowerheads are composite, about in diameter, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each inflorescence is borne on a single leafless stem , rarely tall. The capitulum, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green bracts known as &quot;phyllaries&quot;. The achenes are without pappus.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Bellis&quot; may come from &quot;bellus&quot;, Latin for &quot;pretty&quot;, and &quot;perennis&quot; is Latin for &quot;everlasting&quot;.

The name &quot;daisy&quot;, possibly originating with this plant, is considered a corruption of &quot;day&#x27;s eye&quot;, because the whole head closes at night and opens in the morning. Geoffrey Chaucer called it &quot;eye of the day&quot;. In medieval times, &quot;Bellis perennis&quot; or the English Daisy was commonly known as &quot;Mary&#x27;s Rose&quot;.

Historically, the plant has also been widely known as bruisewort, and occasionally woundwort (although this name is now more closely associated with the genus &quot;Stachys&quot;). It is also known as &quot;bone flower&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Bellis perennis&quot; is native to western, central and northern Europe, including remote islands such as the Faroe Islands, but has become widely naturalised in most temperate regions, including the Americas and Australasia. It prefers field-like habitats.

== Cultivation ==

The species generally blooms from early to midsummer, although when grown under ideal conditions, it has a very long flowering season and will even produce a few flowers in the middle of mild winters.

It can generally be grown where minimum temperatures are above , in full sun to partial shade conditions, and requires little or no maintenance. It has no known serious insect or disease problems and can generally be grown in most well-drained soils. The plant may be propagated either by seed after the last frost, or by division after flowering.

Though not native to the United States, the species is still considered a valuable ground cover in certain garden settings (e.g., as part of English or cottage inspired gardens, as well as spring meadows where low growth and some colour is desired in parallel with minimal care and maintenance while helping to crowd out noxious weeds once established and naturalised).

Numerous single- and double-flowered varieties are in cultivation, producing flat or spherical blooms in a range of sizes () and colours (red, pink and white). They are generally grown from seed as biennial bedding plants. They can also be purchased as plugs in spring.

It has been reported to be mostly self-fertilizing, but some plants may be self-sterile.

==Uses==
&quot;Bellis perennis&quot; may be used as a potherb. Young leaves can be eaten raw in salads, or cooked, though the leaves become increasingly astringent with age. Flower buds and petals can be eaten raw in sandwiches, soups and salads. It is also used as a tea and as a vitamin supplement.

&quot;B. perennis&quot; has astringent properties and has been used in herbal medicine.

Daisies have traditionally been used for making daisy chains in children&#x27;s games.

==Culture==
Daisy is used as a feminine name, and sometimes as a nickname for people named Margaret, after the French name for the oxeye daisy, &quot;marguerite&quot;. 

The daisy is the national flower of the Netherlands.

==Life and career==

===Early years: 1980s===

Lee was brought up in a middle-class family. He lived in Arts Mansion in Happy Valley during his teenage years. He studied in Pun U Association Primary School (1974-1980) and Wah Yan College, Hong Kong (1980-1987).

After his HKCEE in 1985, he entered the TVB new talent show along with Alex To, William So, Vivian Chow and Grasshopper, though he was unable to make it into the top 15 finalists. He then participated in the Second Hong Kong 19 District Singing Contest in 1985, a competition which he won with his rendition of Alan Tam&#x27;s song &quot;Love in the Fog&quot; (霧之戀). He was subsequently offered a contract with PolyGram Records.

Lee however continued his studies at Wah Yan College while singing part-time. He turned full-time in the summer of 1987 after failing to gain a university place due to poor HKALE results.

His debut EP &quot;Hacken Lee EP&quot; sold less than 10,000 copies. &quot;Symbol of Destiny&quot; was released in 1987. His musical popularity lacking, he gained recognition by starring in TVB dramas in the late 1980s, especially the youth drama series &quot;Teenage No More&quot; (不再少年時), for which he also sang the theme song. In 1989, his song &quot;Unchanged in Lifetime&quot;, the theme song of ATV&#x27;s Cantonese version of the drama series &quot;Blue Moon,&quot; won both the RTHK &quot;Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Awards&quot; and &quot;TVB Jade Solid Gold Awards.&quot;

===1990s===
In 1990, Lee, Jacky Cheung and Andy Lau were dubbed as &quot;Three Musketeers in the music industry&quot; by the media and were hailed as &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s highly anticipated superstars&quot;. Later on that year, however, due to the contract disputes between Hacken and his company, Hacken&#x27;s career faltered.

In 1992, Lee&#x27;s career began to rise when he released the song &quot;Red Sun&quot; (紅日), for which he penned the Chinese lyrics that made it popular. In 1993, Hacken switched to Star Record Company and released the song &quot;Look Back,&quot; which once again boosted his singing career and allowed him to win TVB Jade Solid Gold&#x27;s Golden Award as well as reach the top five nominees for the Most Popular Singer Award.

<doc id="1157859" wikidata="Q4156189" url="?curid=1157859" title="Double-deck elevator">
<text>A double-deck elevator or double-deck lift is an elevator where one cab is stacked on top of another. This allows passengers on two consecutive floors to be able to use the elevator simultaneously, significantly increasing the passenger capacity of an elevator shaft. Such a scheme can improve efficiency in buildings where the volume of traffic would normally have a single-deck elevator stopping at every floor. For example, a passenger may board the lower deck (which serves only odd-numbered floors) at basement level while another passenger may board the upper deck (which serves even-numbered floors) on the ground floor—the cab serving even floors is on top of the cab serving odd floors.

Double-deck elevators occupy less building core space than traditional single-deck elevators do for the same level of traffic. In skyscrapers, this allows for much more efficient use of space as the floor area required by elevators is significant.

The other main technique for reducing the floor area occupied by elevators is shared-shaft elevators where multiple elevators use different sections of the same shaft to serve different floors with skylobbies separating the sections. The ThyssenKrupp TWIN elevator places two independent elevator cabs in one shaft and the ThyssenKrupp MULTI system places several elevator cabs in one shaft—each cab is equipped with its own, independent linear motor and can move vertically but also horizontally from one shaft to another.

==Double-deck goods/passenger elevators==
Not all double-deck elevators are used to transport passengers simultaneously in both decks. The second deck in a double-deck car may be used for the transportation of goods, typically outside of peak traffic periods. This technique has the advantages of preventing damage to interior fixtures due to impact from trolleys and not requiring a shaft dedicated to a goods-only elevator car. During peak periods, the elevator is used in passenger-only mode.

As of 2011, no triple-deck elevators have been built, although such a design had been considered for the 163-floor Burj Khalifa before the final design was scaled back to double-deck.

<doc id="1157863" wikidata="Q761761" url="?curid=1157863" title="Mekton">
<text>Mekton is a role-playing game which centers on the conventions of mecha anime and science fiction (although it can easily enough be adapted to other genres like police drama or high fantasy). It has seen several editions since its introduction in 1984, the most recent, &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; (メクトン Z; a reference to the seminal mecha anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;) being first published in 1994.

Mekton was the first anime role-playing game available in North America; the anime influence was muted compared to later editions, but this is in parallel with North America&#x27;s growing exposure to and awareness of anime in general. The use of katakana to represent the title of the game begins with the &quot;Zeta&quot; edition and may or may not be carried over into future editions. A &quot;fourth edition,&quot; usually referred to as &quot;Mekton Double Zeta&quot; and assumed to be using the &quot;Fuzion System&quot; rules (&quot;Mekton II&quot; and &quot;Mekton Z&quot; use the older &quot;Interlock System&quot;), has been rumored to be in development by publishers R. Talsorian Games since 1997. According to designer Mike Pondsmith, one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the introduction of a new edition is a lack of a true &quot;generic&quot; pre-made campaign setting for the game. &quot;Mekton&quot; is a moderately supported system (though no new official material has been released since 1996), with a very active albeit small fanbase, centered on the Mekton Zeta Mailing List, an ezmlm based mailing list active since the fall of 1996.

The intricate detail of the mecha that can be built in &quot;Mekton&quot; is both the game&#x27;s biggest strength and biggest drawback; while nearly anything can be built with the game&#x27;s construction system, from personal armor to gigantic spaceships, it is very time-consuming and can make it nearly impossible to play a quick &quot;pick-up&quot; game.

Within the context of the RPG, mecha are referred to as &quot;mektons,&quot; abbreviated as &quot;meks&quot; and sometimes alternately called &quot;suits&quot; (as in &quot;power suits&quot; or power armor). Several official settings have been published.

&quot;Mekton II&quot; is an important historical artifact in that it was among the first RPG books to use the then-new technique of desktop publishing. &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; has a more pronounced anime influence than the previous two editions; the full cover title of this edition if read in Japanese and translated into English reads &quot;Super Dimension Mobile Warrior Mekton Z&quot;, the title of the game referring to both &quot;Macross&quot; (&quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;) and &quot;Gundam&quot; (&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;).

==History==
Mike Pondsmith decided to self-publish a game which originated in his interest in the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; manga which he combined with the &quot;Imperial Star&quot; game system, which he had designed for his own amusement: this led to the &quot;white box edition&quot; of &quot;Mekton&quot; (1984), a role-playing game which would focus on giant robot combat. &quot;Mekton&quot; was designed by Pondsmith and Mike Jones and published as a boxed set with a 32-page book, a large color map, two cardstock counter sheets, and dice. Pondsmith founded R. Talsorian Games in 1985, which he used to release a second edition of &quot;Mekton&quot; (1986) as a 100-page rulebook. The second edition rulebook also included counters and two maps. &quot;Mekton II&quot; (1987) was the third edition of the game and was the first game to make full use of the company&#x27;s Interlock System. &quot;Mekton II&quot; was designed by Pondsmith and published as a 96-page book, and included art by Ben Dunn. The fourth edition of &quot;Mekton&quot; was called &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; (1994), with a supplement of advanced rules called &quot;Mekton Zeta Plus&quot; (1995). R. Talsorian published a reprint of that game as the ANimechaniX-branded &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; (2000).

==Contents==
The first edition of &quot;Mekton&quot; was a science-fiction system of combat between giant robots, drawing on Japanese animation for inspiration - the first of its type. The second edition from 1985 would add basic role-playing rules. The game covers character and robot construction and combat, including a boardgame-combat-resolution system, plus historical background for the world of Algol and an introductory scenario.

&quot;Mekton II&quot; is a complete revision of the original &quot;Mekton&quot; rules, including expanded character generation and political info on Algol. This version is compatible with &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;.

==Editions of &quot;Mekton&quot;==
* &quot;White Box&quot; &quot;Mekton&quot; (1984) - not a role-playing game, rather a boxed tactical war-game including counters and maps.
* &quot;Mekton&quot; (1985) - softcover book using a custom percentile-based task resolution system. Notable for having misspelled its own name in the katakana.
** &quot;Roadstriker&quot; (1986) - rules for human-scale transformable vehicles and power suit mecha, more advanced transformable mecha design options, and a police drama adventure
* &quot;Mekton II&quot; (1987) - converted &quot;Mekton&quot; to run on the &quot;Interlock System&quot;, later used in &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;. Cover art by Ben Dunn.
** &quot;Roadstriker II&quot; (1990) - rules for human-scale transformable vehicles and power suit mecha, more advanced transformable mecha design options, and a police drama adventure converted to the Mekton II system.
** &quot;Operation Rimfire&quot; (ca. 1990) - campaign book. A very &quot;Gundam&quot;-esque adventure in which representatives of both major political factions on Algol are sent on a long-range interplanetary mission to determine the nature of an anomaly at the edge of the star system. Written to be played as &#x27;episodes&#x27; in a &#x27;series&#x27;. (Reference was made in this book and the later &quot;Mekton Empire&quot; that the anomaly was in actuality a nonfunctional stargate such as is used in the Bendarian Empire.)
** &quot;Mekton Techbook&quot;/&quot;Mekton Technical System&quot; (&quot;MTB&quot;/&quot;MTS&quot;) (1991) - a major conversion of the mecha-building system of &quot;Mekton&quot;
** &quot;Mekton Empire&quot; - This expansion book reduced the Algol system to just one more star among hundreds in the Bendarian Galactic Empire.
* &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; (メクトン Z) (1994) - general update and improvement of &quot;Mekton II&quot;
** &quot;Mekton Zeta Plus&quot; (メクトン Z プラス) (1994) - general update and improvement of the &quot;Mekton Techbook&quot;
*&quot;Gundam Senki&quot; (2000) - Japanese language &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; RPG using the &quot;Mekton&quot; system. Scheduled for US release, release date unspecified at this time.
*&quot;Mekton Zero&quot; (TBA) - crowdfunded project, on indefinite hiatus after being delayed for five years.

==Official settings==
* Algol - A &quot;grab bag&quot; setting in an alternate universe, mixing many different styles of anime together. This setting originated with the first edition of &quot;Mekton&quot;, and was continued in the well-received expansion book &quot;Operation: Rimfire&quot;. Algol was the default setting for &quot;Mekton&quot; and &quot;Mekton II&quot; (as well as &quot;Operation: Rimfire&quot; and &quot;Landstriker&quot;), and remains in &quot;Mekton Z&quot; for legacy purposes (as well as getting a passing reference in &quot;Mekton Empire&quot;). Algol is a long-lost human colony of the Bendar Galactic Empire, where the various factions are locked in a cold war and must deal with an impending ice age and the possible return of their ancient alien enemy, the fearsome Aggendi lizard warriors. The Algol Mailing List continued development on Algol into the early 2000s. 
* Mekton Empire - A space opera setting taking hints from &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;, &quot;Gundam&quot; and &quot;Voltron&quot;, set in the distant Bendar Spiral Galaxy. It added rules for playing aliens (including non-humanoids), space combat, psionics and creating new alien creatures.
* Jovian Chronicles - A heavily &quot;Gundam&quot;-inspired licensed setting created by &quot;Dream Pod 9&quot;, set in the 23rd Century. This would later become a separate game using Dream Pod 9&#x27;s &quot;Silhouette System&quot;.
* Invasion Terra - A &quot;Macross&quot;-like setting in the future of 2105. 
* Imperial Star - Very similar to Mekton Empire but set in the Milky Way Galaxy. This is considered as close to a &#x27;default&#x27; campaign setting for &quot;Mekton Zeta&quot; as exists.
* Quicksilver Blues - Unreleased as of 2004 (complete since at least 2000). As of 2005, Quicksilver Blues is being reworked into a new and separate role-playing game called &quot;Era³&quot; by its original developers, Atomic Rocket Games.
* Starblade Battalion - A &quot;Gundam&quot;-like setting, set in the far future of the &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; world (AD 2180).

==Reception==
In Issue 72 of &quot;Space Gamer&quot;, Allen Varney commented that &quot;its slick appearance and novel topic will sucker any Japanese-robot fan who can&#x27;t wait for one of the other robot games due out soon. Pass the word.&quot;

Phil Frances reviewed &quot;Mekton&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #87, and stated that &quot;In all, a most worthwhile effort – not as slick as FASA&#x27;s &quot;Mechwarrior&quot; or &quot;Battletech&quot;, but admirably simple and flexible.&quot;

In Issue 79 of &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot;, David Jacobs commented that &quot;Even if you&#x27;ve seen all of the Japanese animation featuring giant robots, I strongly suggest that you at least give it a once-over, because these guys and gals at R. Talsorian Games know how to put together a good game. This reviewer strongly suggests that &quot;Mekton&quot; is a must for any game shelf.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan thought that this game &quot;has more in common with tactical military simulations than RPGs.&quot; Swan liked designing the robots, calling the process &quot;fun and simple, easily the most enjoyable part of the game.&quot; However, Swan found the character generation rules &quot;the game&#x27;s weakest feature, apparently included for the sole purpose of generating pilots for the robots ... [the pilots] are essentially irrelevant to the focus of the game.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s possible to design a campaign setting from the information provided ... but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the trouble, because it&#x27;s merely a way to kill time until the next robotic showdown.&quot;

<text>The West Sussex Railway was a 8 and a quarter miles long standard gauge light railway between Chichester and Selsey, in West Sussex. The line, which opened in 1897, was also known as Hundred of Manhood and Selsey Tramway. It was opened as a rail tramway in order to avoid having to comply with regulations that managed conventional railways in the United Kingdom. The line was built under the auspices of the light railway entrepreneur, Colonel Stephens, who would later manage the line as the West Sussex Railway (Tramway Section). 
In December 1910 the line was inundated (flooded by seawater) when an embankment failed at Pagham Harbour. It was not reinstated so work had to be carried out to raise the line above the waters. Although the line was successful in the decades before the First World War, it suffered financially as road transport increased in the 1920s. Despite attempts to be more efficient through modernisations, such as the introduction of petroleum driven rail car services, the railway closed to all traffic in January 1935. Very little remains of the railway&#x27;s infrastructure because of land redevelopment and urban expansion along its permanent way.

==Origins==

The passing of the Light Railways Act 1896 prompted local businessmen to consider whether a light railway connection to Selsey could be made. The town lies on the coast about 8 miles south of the City of Chichester. As they prepared their scheme, they found that it would be possible to get authorisation much more simply under the Railway Construction Facilities Act 1864. By structuring the line as a tramway, the numerous public road level crossings would not require the special safety arrangements required for railway operation, and accordingly they formed the &quot;Hundred of Manhood and Selsey Tramway&quot;. The company was incorporated on 29 April 1896.

H. F. Stephens was appointed as engineer to design the line and supervise construction; this was his second such role, after the Rye and Camber Tramway. His subsequent career pursued several very local lines often run on minimal finance; during war service he became (Lieutenant-) Colonel Stephens, by which he is better known.

The land was acquired from co-operative landowners without the need for compulsory powers, although this forced a slightly indirect route. It started from a point a little to the south of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) station at Chichester; it left westwards and immediately turned south, running broadly southwards to Selsey itself, a distance of . Just south of Chichester, the line crossed the Chichester Canal, which still had some small traffic volume passing, and a simple manually operated lifting bridge was provided there.

The contractor for the construction needed a locomotive for the work, and the locomotive was moved on the public road to get to the line south of the Chichester Canal. It was hauled by a traction engine, and it ran on rails placed on their sides in the roadway; workmen progressively moved the rails to the front of the engine as it made its slow movement. The locomotive was later named &quot;Chichester&quot;.

Whitechurch describes the event; referring to the &quot;Chichester and Birdham Canal&quot; (i.e. the Chichester Canal), he says:

I am able to supply a unique photograph of an incident that happened during the construction of the line owing to this canal. The engine had been brought down to Chichester and was much wanted on the other side of the canal, but as the bridge was not completed for traffic it was impossible to cross. The little locomotive, therefore, had to perform a slow and circuitous journey &quot;by road&quot; of over three miles, being hauled by a traction engine on rails, simply placed down on the road in front of the railway engine and taken up from behind it alternately.

The line was built to standard gauge, , with Vignoles (flat-bottom) rails spiked to light transverse sleepers, &quot;the whole of the line being ballasted with gravel, and, if I mistake not, a goodly bulk of sea shingle mixed therewith&quot;.

The line opened to Selsey Town station on 27 August 1897 and it was extended to Selsey Beach in 1898. The construction and land purchase had cost £21,570 and rolling stock had cost £3,268.

==Operation==
The first passenger coaches were newly built bogie vehicles with open verandas at the end; one was built by Hurst Nelson, and three by Falcon of Loughborough. About 1900 another new coach of similar design was acquired from Hurst Nelson.

 The stations on the line were:
* Chichester; the station was a short distance south of the LB&amp;SCR station
* Hunston, where there was a level crossing and a short siding; there was also a brickworks with an independent loop siding north of the station for some years;
* Hoe Farm [Halt]; this was a private halt for the farm owner;
* Chalder; the access was over a private farm road, and the Company paid the landowner £2 per annum for the wayleave;
* Mill Pond Halt;this was the closest station to Sidlesham village; opened 15 October 1910 and closed May 1911; reopened 9 July 1928;
* Sidlesham; the station name seems to have been spelt &quot;Siddlesham&quot; at first; this was a variant spelling of the village name, although the 1880 Ordnance Survey Map uses the modern spelling; the station was some distance south of the village. Suffering from the 1910 inundation, the station was closed from 15 December 1910 until June 1911; the track level was raised by about at the station level crossing; there was a loop siding here;
* Ferry; Butt names this &quot;Ferry Siding Halt&quot;; Cobb says &quot;Ferry Siding&quot; at first and renamed &quot;Ferry&quot; in 1911;
* Golf Club Halt; this was private
* Selsey Bridge; the main road crossed the line here, the only road bridge on the line; there was a short siding and, some time after 1911 a brick works had a private siding;
* Selsey Town; renamed &quot;Selsey&quot; from 1911; the engine shed was located here, with a goods siding and run-round loop;
* Selsey Beach; opened 1 August 1898 and closed October 1904; the train service may have operated in summer only; there was a simple run-round loop and single platform.

In 1910 there were seven trains each way on weekdays (one extra on Mondays) and three on Sundays. Journey time for the 7¼ miles was 30 minutes.

Whitechurch gave a description of a trip on the line in 1897:

One car stood by the little platform, ready to start. ... This was a third class car. A first class stood in a siding. ... Another car of which I caught a glimpse at Selsey completes, I believe, the &quot;passenger rolling stock&quot; of the little railway. ... The Company own two engines, the &quot;Selsey&quot; and the &quot;Chichester&quot;, the former for &quot;passenger&quot; and the latter, a &quot;six-wheels coupled&quot; for &quot;goods&quot; traffic. The &quot;Selsey&quot;, a trim-looking little side-tank locomotive, is painted dark blue with a red lining ... The boiler is surmounted with a handsome brass dome on which are two spring balances [for the safety valves], while a neat copper ring is an adornment to the chimney.

Before we got away on the journey, a very remarkable operation in shunting had to be performed, albeit it was commenced two minutes after the time for starting. Two trucks were brought in from a siding, and so manipulated with engine and by hand, that finally one was attached in rear of the car, and the other in front of the locomotive!

[Later we came] to Hunston Station, a tiny iron building with a little platform, but a most important point of the line, in that it is the coaling and water depôt, and supplies of both were taken in by the engine, the train backing to allow this to be done, so that our car stood right across the main road during the operation. ... Chalder, another little station was reached at 10.58. We left our rear truck in the siding here ... [At Siddlesham] we performed some marvellous shunting operations, which occupied six minutes, and which resulted in our entering on the last stage of our journey, with three trucks in front of the engine and two behind our carriage—the very best example of a &quot;mixed&quot; train it has ever been my fortune to behold! ... Just before reaching Selsey we passed through the only cutting and under the only road-bridge the line possesses, pausing a few minutes to get rid of our five trucks at a siding.

About midway on the journey home, I, who was seated in the front compartment of the car, saw a red flag being violently waved a few hundred yards ahead. ... as the train slowed down, the individual in question, a stalwart, gaitered farmer, removed the danger signal from his stick, and calmly came aboard the car, doubtless thanking his lucky stars for the little railway that ran within a few feet of the garden of his house.

There were no signals on the line; the train control system was &quot;train staff and ticket&quot; with two sections, broken at Sidlesham.

==Inundation of 1910==
A fierce and prolonged storm took place in December 1910, culminating in a breach of the sea wall during the night of 15 December. of land were flooded, including the railway line north of Ferry. Part of the line was said to be under 12 feet of water.

During the inundation, trains ran from each end of the line, and a horse bus operated in the gap, from Mill Pond Halt to Ferry station. At this time the company was relatively prosperous, and had the resources to raise the line by up to over a considerable length.

==After 1919==
Following the end of the First World War, independent operators of road lorries, and, gradually, road passenger vehicles, became numerous, and the inconvenience of using the tramway became prominent: agricultural produce and supplies needed to be carted to and from the tramway station, and the thinly distributed population were more easily serviced by a road vehicle, especially when that could run to the centre of Chichester or direct to the LB&amp;SCR station there. Traffic declined seriously in the 1920s.

In 1924 the company changed its name to &quot;West Sussex Railway (Tramway Section)&quot; in 1924. Mitchell and Smith suggest that this was a preliminary to securing a takeover by the Southern Railway, the successor to the LB&amp;SCR. The Southern Railway considered the matter but declined to proceed. Southdown Motor Services had been formed in 1915 and was running timetabled bus services locally, and increasingly passengers preferred to take the bus—at a higher fare—and passenger receipts declined further.

During this period freight traffic remained relatively steady at about £2,000 a year.

==Steam locomotives==
The following steam locomotives were used on the line:
Sources for the above table include Kidner Woodcock. and Mitchell and Smith 

&quot;Hesperus&quot; had come from the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway and was originally 3 ft 6 in gauge.

The first &quot;Chichester&quot; arrived with the name &quot;Wembley&quot; having worked there previously, and the engine continued to be known by that name for some time.

&quot;Ringing Rock&quot; was so named because Stephens transferred the name plate from a locomotive on the Kent and East Sussex Railway that had previously worked on the Narberth Road and Maenclochog Railway; Ringing Rock is the English translation of Maenclochog.

==Railcars==
In 1921, Stephens was seeking means of reducing operating expenses, and a trial was made of a Wolseley-Siddeley petrol railcar on the line; this did not immediately lead to adoption, but in 1924, acquired two railcars built on Ford Model T chassis, with bodies by Edmunds of Thetford. They operated together, back-to-back with a truck for luggage and parcels between them; they had rails on the roof to contain additional parcels stowed there.

The &quot;Steam and Things&quot; model making company has good original photographs of the cars at .

Two more railcars were acquired from the Shefflex Motor Company of Tinsley in 1928; they too operated as a unit with a truck between. The railcars were provided with a crude timber buffer beam in front of the radiator, as protection. These are depicted by &quot;Steam and Things&quot; at . See also &quot;Further Reading&quot;, below.

==Coaching stock==
The initial coaching stock fleet consisted of three bogie saloon coaches from Falcons, acquired in 1897. A similar coach was purchased from Hurst Nelson about 1900.

In 1910 three four-wheel coaches were acquired from the Lambourn Valley Railway.

In 1916 a further four four-wheelers were obtained second hand from the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR).

Finally, in 1931 two six-wheel coaches were acquired from the Southern Railway, probably for summer Saturdays when the railcars would be inadequate; they had been built for the LC&amp;DR.

Between the World Wars a number of life-expired main line railway coaches were acquired by private individuals for the purpose of converting them to dwellings on the shore at Selsey. In many cases these vehicles made their final railway journey over the West Sussex Railway to Selsey. A few of these remain in situ, often as part of enlarged buildings, but most have been replaced. There remains one recognisable wooden-bodied Pullman car.

==Closure==
The half mile of track from Selsey Town to Selsey Beach was out of use by the end of 1908. (Butt says October 1904.)

The line was closed in January 1935.

==Archaeology==
For the modern railway explorer this is one of the least rewarding lines to trace as the formation was almost completely at ground level, and almost nothing remains except a half mile section alongside Pagham harbour where the track was raised following the inundation of 1910. A section of about a quarter of a mile, now a farm track between Pagham Harbour and the Selsey Golf Club and a quarter of a mile section (now a public footpath) west of Hunston Village can be traced. The northern end of the latter ends at the abutments of the now defunct Tramway bridge across the Chichester Canal. A short section of trackbed is now a footpath from north of the Chichester Canal to Stockbridge Road, Chichester. The platforms of Hunston and Chalder station can also still be located in fields although badly overgrown. 

==Failed proposals==
In 1913 the directors proposed a light railway extension from Hunston to West Itchenor and East Wittering. However, the First World War put paid to the idea.

This line was surveyed by the builders of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in the early 1920s when they were looking for somewhere to build their miniature line which now runs in Kent. Apparently, despite being otherwise ideal for their purposes, the line was discounted because of the number of road crossings which would have been prohibitively expensive to either gate or bridge. The Southern Railway also surveyed it for takeover and improvement in the early 1930s but decided against both.

==Local colour==
It was known locally as the Selsey Tram. It was also sometimes called &quot;The Siddlesham Snail&quot; after one of the villages having a station of that name. Sidlesham station&#x27;s nameboard originally perpetuated the old spelling &quot;Siddlesham&quot;. A song was written criticising the line which verse went

==Accidents==
On 3 September 1923, the 8:15 a.m. train to Chichester derailed near Golf Club Halt, killing the fireman, H. Barnes, and injuring the driver, C. C. Stewart. None of the few passengers were injured. The locomotive, &quot;Wembley&quot; and the three coaches left the track. The inquest returned a verdict of accidental death, but the jury expressed the opinion that the Chief Engineer of the company was indirectly to blame, as there was evidence of neglect in the upkeep of the track.

==Modelling==
Model kits for the Shefflex railcar (in several scales) are available from &quot;Steam and Things&quot;.

<text>Nick Garcia (born April 9, 1979, in Plano, Texas) is an American former professional soccer player.

==Career==

===Youth and college===
As a junior and senior at Bishop Lynch High School in Dallas, Texas, Garcia helped his high school win their first 2 TAPPS state boys soccer championships in 1996 and 1997. He was selected to the all-district, all-state and all-tournament teams. Garcia won the 1996–97 Gatorade National Boys Soccer Player of the Year award, as well, while starring for Dallas Texans youth club. Garcia played college soccer at Indiana University, leading Indiana to the consecutive national titles in 1998 and 1999, and was named All-American in his final season. Garcia was also named the Soccer America National Freshman of the year while at Indiana University and won the 1999 NCAA Defensive MVP in the College Cup Tournament.

===Professional===
Garcia signed with Project-40 and MLS in 2000, and was drafted second overall (behind Steve Shak) in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards.

Garcia subsequently played in – and started – 224 games for the Wizards between 2000 and 2007 and helped the Wizards win the MLS Cup in 2000, and the US Open Cup in 2004.

He joined the San Jose Earthquakes as their captain upon their return to MLS in 2008. In early 2009 Garcia signed a multi-year contract with San Jose, but was traded (along with the rights to Canadian international Ali Gerba) to Toronto FC on June 9, 2009, for a third round pick in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft.

After the 2010 MLS season Toronto declined Garcia&#x27;s contract option and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Garcia became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft.

===International===
Garcia played in the 1997 World Youth Championship in Ecuador and captained the US Under-20 national team at the World Youth Championship in Nigeria in 1999. Garcia earned his first cap for the full national team on January 18, 2003, against Canada. So far, he has amassed six caps for the United States.

==Personal life==
After retiring, Garcia returned to Kansas City. He worked as an On-Air TV Host for Spectrum Sports for several years. He now serves as executive director of Sporting Brookside and is a professional match evaluator for Major League Soccer.

Garcia is married to his wife MeLinda. They still live in the Kansas City area with their 3 children.

<doc id="1157881" wikidata="Q2349383" url="?curid=1157881" title="Photoisomerization">
<text>In chemistry, photoisomerization is a form of isomerization induced by photoexcitation. Both reversible and irreversible photoisomerizations are known for photoswitchable compounds. The term &quot;photoisomerization&quot; usually, however, refers to a reversible process.

==Applications==
Photoisomerization of the compound retinal in the eye allows for vision.

Photoisomerizable substrates have been put to practical use, for instance, in pigments for rewritable CDs, DVDs, and 3D optical data storage solutions. In addition, interest in photoisomerizable molecules has been aimed at molecular devices, such as molecular switches, molecular motors, and molecular electronics.

Another class of device that uses the photoisomerization process is as an additive in liquid crystals to change their linear and nonlinear properties. Due to the photoisomerization is possible to induce a molecular reorientation in the liquid crystal bulk, which is used in holography, as spatial filter or optical switching.

==Examples==
Azobenzenes, stilbenes, spiropyrans, are prominent classes of compounds subject to photoisomerism.
In the presence of a catalyst, norbornadiene converts to quadricyclane via ~300nm UV radiation. When converted back to norbornadiene, quadryicyclane’s ring strain energy is liberated in the form of heat (&quot;ΔH&quot; = −89 kJ/mol). This reaction has been proposed to store solar energy (photoswitchs).

Photoisomerization behavior can be roughly categorized into several classes. Two major classes are &quot;trans&quot;–&quot;cis&quot; (or &quot;E&quot;–&quot;Z&quot;) conversion, and open-closed ring transition. Examples of the former include stilbene and azobenzene. This type of compounds has a double bond, and rotation or inversion around the double bond affords isomerization between the two states. Examples of the latter include fulgide and diarylethene. This type of compounds undergoes bond cleavage and bond creation upon irradiation with particular wavelengths of light. Still another class is the di-π-methane rearrangement.

==Coordination chemistry==
Many complexes are often photosensitive and many of these complexes undergo photoisomerization. One case is the conversion of the colorless cis-bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum chloride to the yellow trans isomer.
Some coordination complexes undergo change in their spin state upon illumination, i.e. these are photosensitive spin crossover complexes.

<doc id="1157886" wikidata="Q1810024" url="?curid=1157886" title="Pulsar wind nebula">
<text>A pulsar wind nebula (PWN, plural PWNe), sometimes called a plerion (derived from the Greek &quot;πλήρης&quot;, &quot;pleres&quot;, meaning &quot;full&quot;), is a type of nebula sometimes found inside the shell of a supernova remnant (SNR), powered by winds generated by a central pulsar. These nebulae were proposed as a class in 1976 as enhancements at radio wavelengths inside supernova remnants. They have since been found to be infrared, optical, millimetre, X-ray and gamma ray sources.

==Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae==

Pulsar wind nebulae evolve through various phases. New pulsar wind nebulae appear soon after a pulsar&#x27;s creation, and typically sit inside a supernova remnant, for example the Crab Nebula, or the nebula within the large Vela Supernova Remnant. As the pulsar wind nebula ages, the supernova remnant dissipates and disappears. Over time, pulsar wind nebulae may become bow-shock nebulae surrounding millisecond or slowly rotating pulsars.

==Properties of pulsar wind nebulae==

Pulsar winds are composed of charged particles (plasma) accelerated to relativistic speeds by the rapidly rotating, hugely powerful magnetic fields above that are generated by the spinning pulsar. The pulsar wind often streams into the surrounding interstellar medium, creating a standing shock wave called the &#x27;wind termination shock&#x27;, where the wind decelerates to sub-relativistic speed. Beyond this radius, synchrotron emission increases in the magnetized flow.

Pulsar wind nebulae often show the following properties:
* An increasing brightness towards the center, without a shell-like structure as seen in supernova remnants.
* A highly polarized flux and a flat spectral index in the radio band, α=0–0.3. The index steepens at X-ray energies due to synchrotron radiation losses and on the average has an X-ray photon index of 1.3–2.3 (spectral index of 2.3–3.3).
* An X-ray size that is generally smaller than their radio and optical size (due to smaller synchrotron lifetimes of the higher-energy electrons).
* A photon index at TeV gamma-ray energies of ~2.3.

Pulsar wind nebulae can be powerful probes of a pulsar/neutron star&#x27;s interaction with its surroundings. Their unique properties can be used to infer the geometry, energetics, and composition of the pulsar wind, the space velocity of the pulsar itself, and the properties of the ambient medium.

<doc id="1157887" wikidata="Q587607" url="?curid=1157887" title="Supersymmetric quantum mechanics">
<text>In theoretical physics, supersymmetric quantum mechanics is an area of research where supersymmetry are applied to the simpler setting of plain quantum mechanics, rather than quantum field theory. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics has found applications outside of high-energy physics, such as providing new methods to solve quantum mechanical problems, providing useful extensions to the WKB approximation, and statistical mechanics.

== Introduction ==
Understanding the consequences of supersymmetry (SUSY) has proven mathematically daunting, and it has likewise been difficult to develop theories that could account for symmetry breaking, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the lack of observed partner particles of equal mass. To make progress on these problems, physicists developed &quot;supersymmetric quantum mechanics&quot;, an application of the supersymmetry superalgebra to quantum mechanics as opposed to quantum field theory. It was hoped that studying SUSY&#x27;s consequences in this simpler setting would lead to new understanding; remarkably, the effort created new areas of research in quantum mechanics itself.

For example, students are typically taught to &quot;solve&quot; the hydrogen atom by a process that begins by inserting the Coulomb potential into the Schrödinger equation. Following use of multiple differential equations, the analysis produces a recursion relation for the Laguerre polynomials. The outcome is the spectrum of hydrogen-atom energy states (labeled by quantum numbers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;l&quot;). Using ideas drawn from SUSY, the final result can be derived with greater ease, in much the same way that operator methods are used to solve the harmonic oscillator. A similar supersymmetric approach can also be used to more accurately find the hydrogen spectrum using the Dirac equation. Oddly enough, this approach is analogous to the way Erwin Schrödinger first solved the hydrogen atom. He did not &quot;call&quot; his solution supersymmetric, as SUSY was thirty years in the future.

The SUSY solution of the hydrogen atom is only one example of the very general class of solutions which SUSY provides to &quot;shape-invariant potentials&quot;, a category which includes most potentials taught in introductory quantum mechanics courses.

SUSY quantum mechanics involves pairs of Hamiltonians which share a particular mathematical relationship, which are called &quot;partner Hamiltonians&quot;. (The potential energy terms which occur in the Hamiltonians are then called &quot;partner potentials&quot;.) An introductory theorem shows that for every eigenstate of one Hamiltonian, its partner Hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy (except possibly for zero energy eigenstates). This fact can be exploited to deduce many properties of the eigenstate spectrum. It is analogous to the original description of SUSY, which referred to bosons and fermions. We can imagine a &quot;bosonic Hamiltonian&quot;, whose eigenstates are the various bosons of our theory. The SUSY partner of this Hamiltonian would be &quot;fermionic&quot;, and its eigenstates would be the theory&#x27;s fermions. Each boson would have a fermionic partner of equal energy—but, in the relativistic world, energy and mass are interchangeable, so we can just as easily say that the partner particles have equal mass.

SUSY concepts have provided useful extensions to the WKB approximation in the form of a modified version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. In addition, SUSY has been applied to non-quantum statistical mechanics through the Fokker–Planck equation, showing that even if the original inspiration in high-energy particle physics turns out to be a blind alley, its investigation has brought about many useful benefits.

== Example: the harmonic oscillator ==

The Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator takes the form
: formula_1
where formula_2 is the formula_3th energy eigenstate of formula_4 with energy formula_5. We want to find an expression for formula_6 in terms of formula_3. We define the operators
: formula_8
and
: formula_9
where formula_10, which we need to choose, is called the superpotential of formula_11. We also define the aforementioned partner Hamiltonians formula_12 and formula_13 as
: formula_14
: formula_15

A zero energy ground state formula_16 of formula_12 would satisfy the equation
: formula_18

Assuming that we know the ground state of the harmonic oscillator formula_19, we can solve for formula_10 as
: formula_21

We then find that
: formula_22
: formula_23

We can now see that
: formula_24

This is a special case of shape invariance, discussed below. Taking without proof the introductory theorem mentioned above, it is apparent that the spectrum of formula_12 will start with formula_26 and continue upwards in steps of formula_27 The spectra of formula_13 and formula_11 will have the same even spacing, but will be shifted up by amounts formula_30 and formula_31, respectively. It follows that the spectrum of formula_11 is therefore the familiar formula_33.

== SUSY QM superalgebra ==

In fundamental quantum mechanics, we learn that an algebra of operators is defined by commutation relations among those operators. For example, the canonical operators of position and momentum have the commutator formula_34. (Here, we use &quot;natural units&quot; where the Planck constant is set equal to 1.) A more intricate case is the algebra of angular momentum operators; these quantities are closely connected to the rotational symmetries of three-dimensional space. To generalize this concept, we define an &quot;anticommutator&quot;, which relates operators the same way as an ordinary commutator, but with the opposite sign:
: formula_35

If operators are related by anticommutators as well as commutators, we say they are part of a &quot;Lie superalgebra&quot;. Let&#x27;s say we have a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian formula_36 and a set of formula_37 operators formula_38. We shall call this system &quot;supersymmetric&quot; if the following anticommutation relation is valid for all formula_39:
: formula_40

If this is the case, then we call &quot;formula_38&quot; the system&#x27;s &quot;supercharges&quot;.

== Example ==

Let&#x27;s look at the example of a one-dimensional nonrelativistic particle with a 2D (&quot;i.e.,&quot; two states) internal degree of freedom called &quot;spin&quot; (it&#x27;s not really spin because &quot;real&quot; spin is a property of 3D particles). Let formula_42 be an operator which transforms a &quot;spin up&quot; particle into a &quot;spin down&quot; particle. Its adjoint formula_43 then transforms a spin down particle into a spin up particle; the operators are normalized such that the anticommutator formula_44. And formula_45. Let formula_46 be the momentum of the particle and formula_47 be its position with formula_34. Let formula_49 (the &quot;superpotential&quot;) be an arbitrary complex analytic function of formula_47 and define the supersymmetric operators
: formula_51
: formula_52

Note that formula_53 and formula_54 are self-adjoint. Let the Hamiltonian
: formula_55
where &quot;W&quot;′ is the derivative of &quot;W&quot;. Also note that = 0. This is nothing other than &quot;N&quot; = 2 supersymmetry. Note that formula_56 acts like an electromagnetic vector potential.

Let&#x27;s also call the spin down state &quot;bosonic&quot; and the spin up state &quot;fermionic&quot;. This is only in analogy to quantum field theory and should not be taken literally. Then, &quot;Q1&quot; and &quot;Q2&quot; maps &quot;bosonic&quot; states into &quot;fermionic&quot; states and vice versa.

Reformulating this a bit:

Define
: formula_57
and,
: formula_58
: formula_59
and
: formula_60

An operator is &quot;bosonic&quot; if it maps &quot;bosonic&quot; states to &quot;bosonic&quot; states and &quot;fermionic&quot; states to &quot;fermionic&quot; states. An operator is &quot;fermionic&quot; if it maps &quot;bosonic&quot; states to &quot;fermionic&quot; states and vice versa. Any operator can be expressed uniquely as the sum of a bosonic operator and a fermionic operator. Define the supercommutator [,} as follows: Between two bosonic operators or a bosonic and a fermionic operator, it is none other than the commutator but between two fermionic operators, it is an anticommutator.

Then, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are bosonic operators and &quot;b&quot;, formula_43, &quot;Q&quot; and formula_62 are fermionic operators.

Let&#x27;s work in the Heisenberg picture where &quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and formula_43 are functions of time.

Then,
: formula_64
: formula_65
: formula_66
: formula_67
: formula_68
: formula_69

This is nonlinear in general: &quot;i.e.&quot;, x(t), b(t) and formula_70 do not form a linear SUSY representation because formula_71 isn&#x27;t necessarily linear in &quot;x&quot;. To avoid this problem, define the self-adjoint operator formula_72. Then,
: formula_64
: formula_65
: formula_75
: formula_76
: formula_67
: formula_78
: formula_69
: formula_80
and we see that we have a linear SUSY representation.

Now let&#x27;s introduce two &quot;formal&quot; quantities, formula_81; and formula_82 with the latter being the adjoint of the former such that
: formula_83
and both of them commute with bosonic operators but anticommute with fermionic ones.

Next, we define a construct called a superfield:
: formula_84

&quot;f&quot; is self-adjoint. Then,
: formula_85
: formula_86

Incidentally, there&#x27;s also a U(1)R symmetry, with &quot;p&quot; and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;W&quot; having zero R-charges and formula_43 having an R-charge of 1 and &quot;b&quot; having an R-charge of −1.

== Shape invariance ==

Suppose formula_49 is real for all real formula_47. Then we can simplify the expression for the Hamiltonian to
: formula_90
: formula_91

This is the potential for formula_92 angular momentum shifted by a constant. After solving the formula_93 ground state, the supersymmetric operators can be used to construct the rest of the bound state spectrum.

In general, since formula_94 and formula_95 are partner potentials, they share the same energy spectrum except the one extra ground energy. We can continue this process of finding partner potentials with the shape invariance condition, giving the following formula for the energy levels in terms of the parameters of the potential
: formula_96
where formula_97 are the parameters for the multiple partnered potentials.

<text>Rhun ap Maelgwn Gwynedd (died c. 586), also known as Rhun Hir ap Maelgwn Gwynedd (), sometimes spelt as &#x27;Rhûn&#x27;, was King of Gwynedd (reigned c. 547 – c. 586). He came to the throne on the death of his father, King Maelgwn Gwynedd. There are no historical records of his reign at this early age. A story preserved in both the Venedotian Code and an elegy by Taliesin says that he waged a war against Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut and the kings of Gododdin or Manaw Gododdin. The small scattered settlement of Caerhun in the Conwy valley is said to be named for him, though without strong authority. Rhun also appears in several medieval literary stories, as well as in the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;. His wife was Perwyr ferch Rhûn &quot;Ryfeddfawr&quot; and their son was Beli ap Rhun &quot;Hîr&quot;.

Rhun ap Maelgwn appears in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies, Jesus College MS. 20, and &quot;Hengwrt MS. 202&quot;. The &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot; () says that he is the ancestor of Saint Edeyrn (the &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot; says that Edeyrn was the great-grandson of Rhun, while &quot;Hengwrt MS. 202&quot; says that he was the grandson of Rhun).

== War with the North ==
The Venedotian Code of the Welsh laws compiled by Iorwerth ap Madog in the early 13th century contains a list of the privileges of the men of Arfon. Among the privileges is the right to march in the van of Gwynedd&#x27;s army, and this is stated to originate from their spirited actions in a war between Rhun of Gwynedd and the Cymric Men of the North () from the kingdoms of Alt Clut and Gododdin or Manaw Gododdin.

Taliesin&#x27;s &quot;Marwnad Rhun&quot; () also tells of the war and Rhun&#x27;s death in it. In his comprehensive discussion of the works by and attributed to Taliesin, John Morris-Jones notes that the particulars of the &quot;marwnad&quot; are everywhere consistent with the historical record and nowhere inconsistent, and likely a product of the 6th century, a view shared by notable skeptics such as Thomas Stephens.

The Venedotian Code says that the northern prince Elidyr Mwynfawr ap Gorwst Priodawr () had been slain at Aber Mewydus (now called &quot;Cadnant&quot;, or &quot;Battle Brook&quot;) in Arfon, not far from Rhun&#x27;s &quot;llys&quot; () at Llanbeblig. Elidyr&#x27;s powerful relatives in the North invaded Gwynedd in retaliation, burning Arfon in the process. The Northern host was led by Clydno Eiddin; Nudd the Generous, son of Senyllt; Mordaf the Generous, son of Serfan; and Rhydderch Hael, son of Tudwal Tudelyd.

These are all notable men of the era who are listed in the royal genealogies of the &quot;Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd&quot;, as is Elidyr Mwynfawr. According to one of the &quot;Triads of the Horses&quot;, Elidyr was also the husband of Rhun&#x27;s sister Eurgain.

Rhun then assembled an army and proceeded to the banks of the Gweryd (the banks of the River Forth or the Firth of Forth, which William Forbes Skene says was still called the &quot;Weryd&quot; in 1165) in the North. The final outcome is not given in the Venedotian Code, but Rhun and his army remained in the North for a considerable length of time. The outcome according to Taliesin&#x27;s &quot;Marwnad Rhun&quot; is the death of Rhun ap Maelgwn in battle. He was succeeded by his son Beli ap Rhun as King of Gwynedd.

The reason why Elidyr was in Gwynedd and the circumstance of his death are not known, though it is certain from their actions that his northern relatives blamed someone in Gwynedd. There are later stories that add speculations, for example by asserting that Elidyr was contesting Rhun&#x27;s succession to Maelgwn Gwynedd&#x27;s throne, but these are nothing more than speculation.

== Caerhun ==
Caerhun (meaning: Fort of Rhun) is the site of the 2nd century minor Roman fort of Canovium, situated along the Roman road between the larger Roman forts of Deva (at modern Chester) and Segontium (near modern Caernarfon). It is supposed to have been one of Rhun&#x27;s strongholds, and while definitive evidence of this is lacking, it is circumstantially supported by archeological research and the antiquity of the name Caerhun. Furthermore, it guards an important crossing of the River Conwy at Tal-y-Cafn which leads to the pass at Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen, an entrance to &quot;Eryri (Snowdonia)&quot;, the defensive heartland of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Its military significance would certainly have been noticed by both defenders and potential aggressors.

== Rhun in literature ==
The story of &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; in the 12th century Red Book of Hergest is a prose literary tale where the main character travels to the time of King Arthur in a dream. There he sees the famous men from many historical eras. In a passage where 24 knights arrive to seek a truce with the famous Arthur, Arthur considers the request by assembling his counselors where &quot;a tall, auburn, curly-headed man&quot; was standing. Rhonabwy asks who he is, and is told that he is Rhun ap Maelgwn Gwynedd, a man who may join in counsel with anyone because there was none in Britain better skilled in counsel than he.

&quot;Marwnad Rhun&quot; (), once believed to be the work of Taliesin but no longer accepted as such, laments Rhun&#x27;s death in battle during that War with the North.

Rhun appears in two of the medieval &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;, as one of the &quot;Fair Princes of the Isle of Britain&quot;, and as one of the &quot;Golden-banded Ones of the Isle of Britain&quot;.

== Literary missteps ==
The &quot;Tale of Taliesin&quot; is a legendary story about Taliesin printed in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, and based in part on the forgeries of the &quot;Iolo Manuscripts&quot; by Iolo Morganwg. The story tells of events where Taliesin is placed in difficult or impossible situations but invariably overcomes all obstacles, usually through feats of magic. In one passage, Maelgwn Gwynedd sends his son Rhun on a mission to seduce the wife of Elffin ap Gwyddno. However, Elffin&#x27;s court bard Taliesin knew of Maelgwn&#x27;s plan because he was a seer, and arranged for a servant to replace his patron&#x27;s wife, to the ultimate embarrassment of his patron&#x27;s opponent Maelgwn.

One of the &quot;Triads&quot; mentions a certain Rhun ap Beli () who was famed for his military exploits. The name is repeated elsewhere in medieval poetry, such as in Hywel Foel&#x27;s (fl. c. 1240 – 1300) &quot;awdl&quot; lamenting the capture and imprisonment of Owain ap Gruffudd, where he likens Owain to Rhun: &quot;Who if free, like Rhun the son of Beli, Would not let Lloegria burn his borders&quot;. There is no confirming evidence that such a person existed, and it is contradicted by records such as the royal genealogies, which have Rhun as the father (not the son) of Beli. Scholars such as Thomas Stephens have concluded that this is a mistake, and that the intended person was someone else.

<text>A means test is a determination of whether an individual or family is eligible for government benefits, assistance or welfare, based upon whether the individual or family possesses the means to do with less or none of that help.

== Canada ==

In Canada, means tests are used for student finance (for post-secondary education), legal aid, and &quot;welfare&quot; (direct transfer payments to individuals to combat poverty). They are not generally used for primary and secondary education which are tax-funded. Means tests for public health insurance were once common but are now illegal, as the Canada Health Act of 1984 requires that all the provinces provide universal healthcare coverage to be eligible for subsidies from the federal government. Means tests are also not used for pensions and seniors&#x27; benefits, but there is a clawback of Old Age Security payments for people making over $69,562 (in 2012). The Last Post Fund uses a means test on a deceased veteran&#x27;s estate and surviving widow to determine whether they are eligible for federal funding to subsidize their funeral.

==United Kingdom==

Resentment over a means test was among the factors giving rise to the National Unemployed Workers&#x27; Movement in the United Kingdom. Today, means-tested benefits—meaning that entitlement is affected by the amount of income, savings, capital and assets— is a central feature of the benefit system. Means testing is also part of the determination of legal aid in a magistrates court and for the higher Crown Court. The means test is based on income, family circumstances and essential living costs.
The Beveridge Report of 1942 proposed a system of contributory benefits which would leave only a residual role for means-tested benefits which were then called National Assistance.
The income limits are specified in relation to the needs of a household and for savings there are upper limits for some of the benefits. A couple who are not married may be treated as living together as a married couple.

The main means-tested benefits in 2019 were:

* Income Support
* Income-based Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance
* Income-related Employment and Support Allowance 
* Pension Credit 
* Universal Credit
* Housing Benefit
* Working Tax Credit
* Child Tax Credit
Receipt of such benefits other than Housing Benefit and tax credits is a passport to other non-cash help such as free school meals, free prescription charges, Legal Aid, cold weather payment. The claimant, their partner and dependent children are covered. The rules for free NHS dentistry and optical charges have become more complex since the introduction of Universal Credit and have led to many people facing financial penalties, often wrongly.
People who are not entitled to any of the qualifying benefits may be able to qualify for help with health charges by a separate means test, the NHS Low Income Scheme.
Defunct benefits include:
* National Assistance
* Supplementary Benefit
* Family Credit
* Family Income Supplement
* Social Fund (UK)

==United States==
Means testing is used to test for eligibility to Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Section 8 housing, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Work-Study Program, direct subsidized student loans, as well as the eligibility for relief for debtors who have sufficient financial &quot;means&quot; to pay a portion of their debts. The means test is perhaps best recognized in the United States as the test used by courts to determine eligibility for Title 11 of the United States Code Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the test was used to screen applicants for such programs as Home Relief, and starting in the 1960s, for benefits such as those provided by Medicaid and the Food Stamp Program.

In 1992, third-party presidential candidate Ross Perot proposed that future Social Security benefits be subjected to a means test; though this was hailed by some as a potential solution to a purported impending crisis in funding the program, few other political candidates since Perot have publicly made the same suggestion, which would require costly investigations and might associate accepting those benefits with social stigma.

In 2005, the US substantially changed its bankruptcy laws, adding a means test to prevent wealthy debtors from filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. The most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within . The amendments effectively subject most debtors who make an income, as calculated by the Code, above the median income of the debtor&#x27;s state to an income-based test. This is referred to as the &quot;means test&quot;. The means test provides for a finding of abuse if the debtor&#x27;s income is higher than a specified portion of their debts. If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may be rebutted only in the case of &quot;special circumstances&quot;.

Debtors whose income is below the state&#x27;s median income are not subject to the means test. The Code-calculated income may be higher or lower than the debtor&#x27;s actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code&#x27;s &quot;current monthly income&quot; as &quot;presumed income&quot;. If the debtor&#x27;s debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable.

Thus, the means test is a formula designed to keep filers with higher incomes from filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These filers may use Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay a portion of their debts, but may not use Chapter 7 to wipe out their debts altogether. The bankruptcy means test is complex and the terms that govern many parts of it – including those terms that control whether it applies at all – are of unsettled definition.

==Other examples==
Other examples of means testing include Medifund in Singapore and medical cards in Ireland. Both are used in the healthcare sector. Australia uses a means test for its Age Pension.

<text>The Hakomi Method is a psychotherapeutic approach developed by Ron Kurtz in the 1970s that integrates mindfulness and somatic techniques to address psychological and emotional issues.

==Approach and method==
According to the Hakomi Institute, the method uses mindfulness, psychotherapy, and somatic interventions to address attachment wounds and developmental trauma. Hakomi combines Western psychology, systems theory, and body-centered techniques with the principles of mindfulness and nonviolence drawn from Eastern philosophy.

Hakomi is grounded in five principles:
* mindfulness
* nonviolence
* organicity
* unity
* body-mind holism

These five principles are set forth in Kurtz&#x27;s book, &quot;Body-Centered Psychotherapy&quot;. Some Hakomi leaders add two more principles, truth and mutability.

The Hakomi Method regards people as &quot;self-organizing systems&quot;, organized psychologically around core memories, beliefs, and images; this core material expresses itself through habits and attitudes around which people unconsciously organize their behavior. The goal is to transform one&#x27;s way of being in the world through working with core material and changing core beliefs.

Unlike other forms of therapy, Hakomi relies on mindfulness as its main tool, rather than using it as an aid to more traditional psychotherapy.

The Hakomi Method follows this general outline:

# Create healing relationship: Client and therapist work to build a relationship that maximizes safety and the cooperation of the unconscious. This includes practicing a so-called &quot;loving presence&quot;, a state of acceptance and empathic resonance.
# Establish mindfulness: The therapist helps clients study and focus on the ways they organize experience. Hakomi&#x27;s viewpoint is that most behaviors are habits automatically organized by core material; therefore, studying the organization of experience is studying the influence of this core material.
# Evoke experience: Client and therapist make direct contact with core feelings, beliefs, and memories using &quot;experiments in mindfulness&quot;—somatic and verbal techniques to &quot;access&quot; the present experience behind the client&#x27;s verbal presentation, or to explore &quot;indicators&quot;: chronic physical patterns, habitual gestures, bodily tension, etc.
# Processing: This process usually evokes deeper emotions, memories, or both, and if the client feels ready, the therapist helps them deepen into these, often using state-specific processing such as &quot;working with the child&quot;, strong emotions, or both. The client is helped to recognize the core beliefs as they emerge, and the therapist often provides what Kurtz called &quot;the missing experience&quot;, a form of &quot;memory re-consolidation&quot; where the child, as they revisit the negative experience(s) that generated their core beliefs, now receives the nourishment and support that was needed at the time. This supports the process of transformation of core beliefs. The same process may be used working with the adult rather than the &quot;child state&quot;.
# Transformation: The client has an experience in therapy different from the one they had as a child (or are having as an adult) and experientially realizes that new healing experiences are possible and begins to be open to these experiences.
# Integration: Client and therapist work to make connections between the new healing experiences and the rest of the client&#x27;s life and relationships.

Other components of the Hakomi Method include the sensitivity cycle, techniques such as &quot;contact and tracking&quot;, &quot;prompts&quot;, &quot;taking over&quot;, &quot;embracing resistance&quot;, and developing a greater sensitivity to clients and how to work with their individual issues based on the character typology introduced by Alexander Lowen.

==Related therapies==
The Hakomi Institute (founded in 1981) describes itself as an international nonprofit organization that teaches Hakomi therapy worldwide. Its website includes an international directory of Hakomi practitioners. The institute&#x27;s programs focus on training psychotherapists and professionals in related fields. Its faculty are mainly professional psychotherapists who base their teaching of the Hakomi Method on current discoveries in neuroscience and on their own clinical insights. The Hakomi Institute is a professional member of the Association for Humanistic Psychology, the U.S. Association for Body Psychotherapists, and an accredited Continuing Education provider for the National Board for Certified Counselors and the National Association of Social Workers.

Ron Kurtz left the Hakomi Institute in the 1990s to create a new organization, Ron Kurtz Trainings. With a new group, he developed the Hakomi Method in new directions, offering training for both professionals and laypeople. He called the refined version of his work Hakomi Assisted Self-Discovery.

Both versions of the Hakomi Method are based on loving presence, mindfulness, somatics, and the other principles described above, and fall within the definition of body psychotherapy.

Another technique based on the Hakomi Method is Sensorimotor psychotherapy, developed by Pat Ogden.

==Validation==
The European Association for Psychotherapy recognizes body psychotherapy as a validated branch of psychotherapy; the Hakomi Method is one of the modalities included under this category.

<text>OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages &amp; Applications) is an annual ACM research conference. OOPSLA mainly takes place in the United States, while the sister conference of OOPSLA, ECOOP, is typically held in Europe. It is operated by the Special Interest Group for Programming Languages (SIGPLAN) group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

OOPSLA has been instrumental in helping object-oriented programming develop into a mainstream programming paradigm. It has also helped incubate a number of related topics, including design patterns, refactoring, aspect-oriented programming, model-driven engineering, agile software development, and domain specific languages.

The first OOPSLA conference was held in Portland, Oregon in 1986. As of 2010, OOPSLA became a part of the SPLASH conference. SPLASH stands for Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity.

<doc id="1157910" wikidata="Q1385340" url="?curid=1157910" title="Jimmy Conrad">
<text>James Paul Conrad (born February 12, 1977) is an American former soccer player who played as a defender. During his 13-year MLS career, he was four-time MLS Best XI and the 2005 MLS Defender of the Year. He also earned 27 caps with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team and went to the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

After his playing career Conrad has worked in the media industry and currently stars on his YouTube channel Jimmy Conrad, he also streams on Twitch regularly. He currently serves as the technical director of USL League Two side San Francisco Glens.

== Early life ==
On February 12, 1977, Conrad was born in Arcadia, California. Conrad attended Temple City High School in Temple City, California.

Conrad attended Temple City High School in Temple City, California and was a four-year letterman in soccer. Conrad played at San Diego State University in 1994 and 1995, and then transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles. While playing for UCLA, he was a member of the 1997 NCAA Championship team.

==Playing career==

===Professional===
Undrafted by MLS, Conrad had an unsuccessful trial with the Los Angeles Galaxy. However, the Galaxy coaching staff recommended he play for one of their affiliated lower division teams. Consequently, Conrad contacted the now-defunct San Diego Flash of the A-League which gave him a contract. In 1999, Brian Quinn became the head coach of the San Jose Clash. When Quinn began searching for an additional defender and goalkeeper for the Clash, Ralf Wilhelms, head coach of the Flash and a former teammate of Quinn on the San Diego Sockers, recommended Conrad and Flash goalkeeper Joe Cannon. The Clash signed Conrad that year. He played with the club, later re-branded as the Earthquakes, for four seasons, helping them to the MLS Cup in 2001. In 2000, he also played for Lech Poznań in Poland.

In 2003, Conrad was traded to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the &#x27;Quakes used to select Arturo Alvarez. Conrad&#x27;s stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he helped the Wizards to the US Open Cup and the MLS Cup Final as the leader of the league&#x27;s stingiest defense and was named to the league&#x27;s Best XI and was a finalist for MLS Defender of the Year Award. He won the award a year later.

Despite rumors of a possible European transfer following the Wizards&#x27; disappointing 2006 season, Conrad renewed his contract with the Wizards beginning the 2007 season, and new head coach Curt Onalfo rewarded him the club captaincy.

Conrad was out of contract after the 2010 MLS season and elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 15, 2010, Conrad was selected by Chivas USA in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft. He made his debut, and scored his first goal for his new team on March 19, 2011, in their first game of the 2011 MLS season – ironically against his old club, Sporting Kansas City.

After struggling with injury during the 2011 season, and suffering from side effects of six concussions, Jimmy Conrad announced his retirement from professional soccer on August 18, 2011.

===International===
Conrad received his first cap for the United States national team on July 7, 2005, in a Gold Cup match against Cuba. Less than one year later, Conrad made the U.S. roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In Germany, Conrad came in as a substitute against Italy in the team&#x27;s 1–1 draw with the eventual champions, and played all ninety minutes against Ghana. On January 20, 2007, Conrad captained the national team for the second time, where the United States hosted an international friendly with Denmark. The U.S. won that match 3–1. On February 7, 2007, in an international friendly with Mexico, Conrad was named the Man of the Match. He scored his first-ever goal for the U.S. in the fifty-second minute of that match. On June 25, 2009, after not having played with the national team in previous qualifying, Conrad was named to the U.S. squad for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==Coaching==
In September 2018, Conrad became technical director and head associate coach of the San Francisco Glens. He was named head coach of the Glens ahead of the 2020 season. In 2022, Conrad returned to his role as technical director and head associate coach for the Glens to work with new head coach Gabe Saucedo. The club made the USL League Two playoffs for the first time that season, upsetting top-seeded Capital FC before bowing out in the Western Conference semifinals.

== Awards ==
* 2012 Grand Marshal at 68th Annual Camellia Festival of Temple City.
* 2014 Sporting Legends. Presented by Sporting Kansas City.

== Personal life ==
Conrad&#x27;s wife is Lyndsey Conrad. They have two daughters, Julia Rose Conrad, born in 2007, Jane Mirabelle Conrad, born 2011. He is a correspondent for the UEFA Champions League and Europa League for CBS Sports. Conrad is an avid supporter of Premier League side Newcastle United.

<doc id="1157911" wikidata="Q2391063" url="?curid=1157911" title="Smerd">
<text>A smerd () was a free peasant and later a feudal-dependent serf in the medieval Slavic states of East Europe. Sources from the 11th and 12th centuries (such as the 12th-century &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;) mention their presence in Kievan Rus&#x27; and Poland as the &quot;smardones&quot;. Etymologically, the word &quot;smerd&quot; comes from a common Indo-European root meaning &quot;ordinary man&quot; or &quot;dependent man&quot;.

In Kievan Rus&#x27;, &quot;smerdy&quot; were peasants who gradually lost their freedom (partially or completely) and whose legal status differed from group to group. Unlike slaves, they had their own property and had to pay fines for their delinquencies, legally the &quot;smerds&quot; never possessed full rights; killing of a &quot;smerd&quot; was punished by the same fine as killing of a &quot;kholop&quot; (similarly to a slave). The property of the deceased was inherited by the &quot;knyaz&quot; (prince). The &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; forbade torturing &quot;smerds&quot; during court examination without consent of the &quot;knyaz&quot;.

During the 12th and the 13th centuries a number of sources mention the &quot;smerdy&quot; while narrating events in Halych-Volynia and in Novgorod. It appears that during this period the term &quot;smerd&quot; encompassed the whole rural population of a given region. Sources of the 14th and 15th centuries refer to &quot;smerds&quot; of Novgorod and Pskov as peasant-proprietors, who possessed lands collectively (communes) or individually and had the right to freely alienate their own allotments. However, their personal freedom was limited: they were forbidden to seek a new master or princely patronage. The &quot;knyaz&quot; could not accept complaints from &quot;smerds&quot; against their master. Also, &quot;smerds&quot; had to provide labor services and to pay tribute (&quot;dan&quot;&#x27;) to the benefit of the city as a collective feudal master.

In Russia from the 14th century the word &quot;smerd&quot; as a denotation for peasants and other commonfolk was replaced with the word &quot;krestyanin&quot; (&quot;крестьянин&quot;), meaning peasant. The change was connected to the dying out of Slavic paganism by that time, as well as to the Islamization of the Golden Horde under Öz Beg Khan (ruled 1313–1341), which fostered the rise of Christian self-identification in the vassal Russian lands that were under Mongol yoke.

The old word &quot;smerd&quot; continued to be used in a pejorative meaning, often in a situation when a lord spoke to dependent people or even to lesser nobles. Also the word acquired a meaning of &quot;one who stinks&quot;, with the related verb &quot;&#x27;smerdet&#x27; &quot; (&quot;смердеть&quot; or &quot;śmierdzieć&quot;, to stink).

<text>High Tension (French: Haute tension, ; also known as Switchblade Romance in some international countries) is a 2003 French slasher film directed by Alexandre Aja, co-written with Grégory Levasseur, and starring Cécile de France and Maïwenn. The plot focuses on two female students who drive to one of their family&#x27;s secluded farmhouses to study for their exams, where a murderer shows up on the night of their arrival.

&quot;High Tension&quot; was theatrically released in France on June 18, 2003, and was screened at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival as part of the &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; section, where it was acquired by Lions Gate Entertainment. After being re-dubbed in English and re-edited to secure an R rating, Lions Gate Entertainment then spent $14 million for a wide release in the United States on June 10, 2005, where it ultimately grossed only $3.6 million. It received mixed reviews from critics.

The film has been cited as being associated with the New Extremity movement.

==Plot==
Marie and Alex are best friends on their way to stay at Alex&#x27;s parents&#x27; house for the weekend to study. When they arrive, Alex gives Marie a tour of her house before they settle down for dinner. After dinner, Marie and Alex get ready to go to bed. As Alex sleeps, Marie lies on her bed listening to music and masturbating. Marie hears a doorbell ring and Alex&#x27;s father Daniel wakes to answer it. The man at the door is a serial killer, who slashes Daniel&#x27;s face with a straight razor. His head is pressed between two spindles of the staircase, and the killer shoves a bookcase towards his head, decapitating him. The noise awakens Alex&#x27;s mother, who finds Daniel dead and is approached by the killer.

Marie, hearing the mother&#x27;s screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed. The killer inspects Marie&#x27;s room but does not find her. Marie creeps downstairs and finds Alex chained in her bedroom. Promising to find help, she sneaks into the parents&#x27; room to find a phone. After hearing loud thuds, she hides in the closet and through the slats of the door witnesses the killing of Alex&#x27;s mother as her throat is brutally slashed with a razor.

Alex&#x27;s younger brother Tom runs from the house to the cornfield, pursued by the killer. Marie returns to Alex, where she witnesses Tom&#x27;s murder from a window. Marie promises to free Alex, but the killer is heard returning. Marie sneaks into the kitchen and takes a butcher knife. Alex is dragged into the killer&#x27;s truck. Marie sneaks into the truck with the butcher knife and hides there with Alex. He locks them in and drives off.

When the killer stops at a gas station, Marie gives Alex the knife and sneaks into the gas station shop for help. When the killer comes into the shop, Marie hides and she witnesses the store clerk Jimmy being murdered with an axe. The killer returns to the truck and Marie calls the police but hangs up in frustration when she&#x27;s unable to tell them where she is. She takes the clerk&#x27;s keys and uses his car to follow the killer down a deserted road. The killer notices Marie following him, and rams Marie&#x27;s vehicle, pushing the car off the road where it wrecks. Exiting on foot, badly injured, Marie runs into the forest as the killer seeks her. Eventually, Marie bludgeons the killer with a fence post covered in barbed wire. As Marie inspects the body, he grabs at her throat, so Marie suffocates him with a plastic sheet and makes her way back to the truck. Alex seems terrified of Marie as she returns to the vehicle. As police investigate the gas station murders via the in-store videotape, the tape shows Marie murdering the store clerk. In retrospect, it is revealed that Marie is murderous, delusional, and in love with Alex and the real killer of Alex&#x27;s family.

At the truck, Marie unties Alex. As soon as Alex is free, she threatens Marie with the knife and accuses her of butchering her family. Alex slashes Marie&#x27;s face and stabs her in the stomach before running into the forest. Marie chases Alex with a concrete saw. Alex finds a road and flags down a car. As Alex is climbing into the car, Marie appears brandishing the concrete saw and disembowels the driver. A stray piece of glass slices Alex&#x27;s Achilles tendon. Alex takes a crowbar from the car&#x27;s toolbox and crawls along the road. Marie forces Alex to tell her that she loves her, and she kisses her. While engaged in the kiss, Alex plunges the crowbar into Marie&#x27;s upper-chest as Marie proclaims she&#x27;ll never let anyone come between them.

Sometime later, Marie is in a psychiatric hospital room chained to her bed, with Alex watching her through a one-way mirror. Marie grins and reaches for Alex, evidently aware that she is behind it.

==Cast==
* Cécile de France as Marie
* Maïwenn as Alexia Soral
* Philippe Nahon as The Killer
* Andrei Finti as Daniel Soral, Alex&#x27;s father

==Release==
&quot;High Tension&quot; was released in France on 18 June 2003 where it was distributed by EuropaCorp.

The film was shown at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival during the Midnight Madness section. After screening at the festival, the film was purchased by Lionsgate Films for North American distribution. In her book &quot;Films of the New French Extremity&quot;, Alexandra West described The screening of &quot;High Tension&quot; at Midnight Madness made that section of the film festival an &quot;unintentional bastion for New French Extremity&quot;, which still did not have a popular following. Following &quot;High Tensions&quot;&#x27;s release there, other films followed at the festival such as &quot;Calvaire&quot; (2004), &quot;Sheitan&quot; (2006) and &quot;Frontier(s)&quot; and &quot;Inside&quot; (2007) and &quot;Martyrs&quot; (2008).

In the United States, Lionsgate released an English-dubbed version of the film in 1323 theaters on 10 June 2005 (with $14 million marketing cost). Several murders scenes were truncated in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. A re-cut theatrical trailer was released by Lionsgate to promote the film, featuring &quot;Superstar&quot; by Sonic Youth.

===Censorship===

Some scenes were edited for the American version to achieve an R rating by the MPAA. About one minute of the film was cut in order to avoid the NC-17 rating. The R-rated edition was released in American cinemas, in a less widely circulated fullscreen DVD, and on the streaming service Tubi. This section notes what was deleted from the unrated, original French film to produce the American version.
* Alex&#x27;s father is graphically decapitated with a bookcase, his headless neck spraying blood. In the R-rated version, the murder is edited to quickly cut away as the bookcase crushes and severs his head. Later the body is seen on the staircase without the head. 
* When Alex&#x27;s mother has her throat slashed, the scene is shortened; most of the arterial spurting, as the killer pulls back her head, is gone. Subsequent shots of Marie inspecting the body have also been edited.
* The death of Jimmy the gas station clerk has been shortened. Close-up shots of the axe sticking in his chest have been removed.
* The scene where Marie strikes the killer&#x27;s face with the barbed wire pole is shortened and less explicit; Marie hits the killer fewer times, and fewer details of the killer&#x27;s wounds are shown.
* The driver&#x27;s disembowelment with the concrete saw was shortened.
* A close-up of the crowbar in Marie&#x27;s shoulder is missing.

==Reception==
According to the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 41% approval rating based on 133 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.30/10. The consensus states: &quot;There is indeed a good amount of tension in this French slasher, but the dubbing is bad and the end twist unbelievable.&quot; It also received a score of 42 on Metacritic based on 30 critics, classifying it as having received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

American film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film only one star, opening his review, &quot;The philosopher Thomas Hobbes tells us life can be &#x27;poor, nasty, brutish and short.&#x27; So is this movie.&quot; He added that the film had a plot hole &quot;that is not only large enough to drive a truck through, but in fact does have a truck driven right through it.&quot;

Lisa Nesselson of &quot;Variety&quot; was more forgiving, saying that the film &quot;deftly juggles gore and suspense&quot;, has &quot;unnerving sound design&quot;, and &quot;has a sinister, haemoglobin look that fits the story like a glove&quot;. James Berardinelli praised the film, writing: &quot;The film revels in blood and gore, but this is not just a run-of-the-mill splatter film. There&#x27;s a lot of intelligence in both the script and in Alexandre Aja&#x27;s direction ... For those who enjoy horror films and don&#x27;t mind copious quantities of red-dyed fluids, this one is not to be missed. It&#x27;s a triumph of the Grand Guignol.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Mark Holcomb wrote that the film resembles &quot;a pastiche of &#x27;70s American slasher flicks that seemingly stands to add to the worldwide glut of irono-nostalgic sequels, remakes, and retreads,&quot; ultimately seeing it a &quot;gratifyingly gory, doggedly intellectual decon of the likes of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot; and (surprisingly but aptly) &quot;Duel&quot;.&quot;

==Controversy==
The film was included in &quot;TIME&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 10 most ridiculously violent films.

Several viewers of the film noticed striking similarities between the plot of the film and the plot of Dean Koontz&#x27;s novel &quot;Intensity&quot;. When questioned at the Sundance Festival in 2004, the director acknowledged that he had read the novel and was aware of the similarities. On his website, Koontz stated that he was aware of the comparison but would not sue &quot;because he found the film so puerile, so disgusting, and so intellectually bankrupt that he didn’t want the association with it that would inevitably come if he pursued an action against the filmmaker.&quot;

<text>Silvia &quot;Bibi&quot; Gaytán Barragán (born 27 January 1972) is a Mexican singer and actress. Since she was born, she has lived in Villahermosa, Tabasco and she considers herself &quot;Tabasqueña&quot;.

==Career==
She is the only female among five brothers: musician Gonzalo &quot;Chacho&quot; Gaytán, retired actor Alejandro Gaytán, Timbiriche&#x27;s Daniel &quot;Mano&quot; Gaytán and Rodrigo &quot;Ruy&#x27; Gaytán. Bibi Gaytán started her career in 1989 when she joined the musical group Timbiriche, taking the place of original band member Alix Bauer. When she was in Timbiriche, she finished the tour for the &quot;Timbiriche 8/9&quot; album, and later recorded and toured for the &quot;Timbiriche 10&quot; album.

In 1991, she was cast in the Televisa telenovela, &quot;Alcanzar Una Estrella II&quot;, co-starring Sasha Sokol, Ricky Martin, Erik Rubin, Angélica Rivera, Pedro Fernández, among other known actors, as part of a fictional musical group called &quot;Muñecos de papel&quot;. Her solo song, &quot;Tan Sólo Una Mujer&quot; written by Ricardo Arjona, hit the charts and was a success in her singing career. She later left Timbiriche in May and her place was taken by Tanya Velasco.

1992 was an important year in Bibi&#x27;s career. She starred in what became the box office hit of the year, the film &quot;Mas Que Alcanzar Una Estrella&quot; as part of the &quot;Alcanzar una estrella&quot; saga. That same year, she got one of the leads in the soap opera, &quot;Baila Conmigo&quot;, along with singer Paulina Rubio, and Eduardo Capetillo with whom she started a romantic relationship by the end of the telenovela. In September 1992, she released her first solo album, &quot;Bibi Gaytán&quot;. That album included the singles, &quot;Y Se Marcha Diciendo Perdon&quot;, &quot;No Me Importa&quot;, &quot;Mucha Mujer Para Ti&quot;, and &quot;Rock Cafe&quot;. She also released a 1993 calendar that was a hit.

After intense promotion of her debut album in Latin America, in mid-1993, she was cast for another telenovela. One of the most popular telenovelas in television history in Mexico, &quot;Dos Mujeres, Un Camino&quot;, alongside Erik Estrada and Laura Leon. It was the first telenovela that included &quot;grupero artists&quot; such as Grupo Bronco and the late Selena. The telenovela lasted one year.

In 1994, Bibi released her second studio album titled Manzana Verde. The promotion of this album did not even start because Bibi was pregnant. On 25 June 1994, Bibi and Eduardo Capetillo got married in the State of Morelos in Hacienda de Chiconcuac, an estate built in the 16th century by Martín Cortés, son of Hernán Cortés and La Malinche. The wedding was televised and was a historic event in Mexican Pop Culture.

On 17 August 1994, Eduardo Capetillo Gaytán was born and later, on 13 May 1997, Ana Paula Capetillo Gaytán was born.

In 1998, both Bibi and Capetillo starred in the telenovela, &quot;Camila&quot; alongside Adamari Lopez. It was the new version of 80s hit &quot;Viviana&quot;. This is the last telenovela where Bibi has worked as a lead protagonist.

A third child was born on 4 November 1999, Alejandra Capetillo Gaytán.

In the 2000s, we saw Bibi do television ads, she even starred in 5 episodes of &quot;En Nombre del Amor&quot;, she was a guest judge in Bailando por un sueño. In late 2010 Eduardo and Bibi moved from Televisa to Television Azteca. Bibi did La Academia as a co-host and later Mexico Baila as a dance judge.

The Capetillo Gaytán family kept growing, and on 20 June 2014, twin brothers Manuel Capetillo Gaytán and Daniel Capetillo Gaytán were born.

Bibi is active on social media, with official Instagram and Twitter accounts.

<doc id="1157940" wikidata="Q6386578" url="?curid=1157940" title="Keltie Glacier">
<text>The Keltie Glacier () is a large Antarctic glacier, long, draining from Pain Névé southwest around the southern extremity of the Commonwealth Range, and then northwest to enter Beardmore Glacier at Ranfurly Point. It was discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09, under Ernest Shackleton, who named it for Sir John Scott Keltie, Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, 1892–1915.

==Course==

The Keltie Glacier originates in the Pain Névé below Mount Kaplan and Mount Wexler in the Hughes Range of the Queen Maud Mountains.
It flows southwest between the Hughes Range and the Commonwealth Range.
It is joined from the east by the Brandau Glacier to the north of the Barton Mountains, where it turns west.
It then turns northwest past the Supporters Range, from which it is joined by the Snakeskin Glacier and then the Laird Glacier before entering the Beardmore Glacier from the east past Ranfurly Point.
The Brandau Glacier is fed by the Leigh Hunt Glacier from the left (south) before joining the Keltie Glacier.
The Snakeskin Glacier is fed from the right (east) by the Falkenhof Glacier.

==Tributaries==

===Pain Névé===
A névé between Commonwealth Range and Hughes Range from which the Keltie Glacier drains southwestward to enter Beardmore Glacier. 
Named by the Southern Party of New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) (1961–62) for Kevin Pain, field assistant with the party.

===Brandau Glacier===
A wide tributary glacier, long, flowing westward from an ice divide between Haynes Table and Husky Heights to enter Keltie Glacier just west of Ford Spur. 
Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Lt. Cdr. James F. Brandau, USN, pilot with Squadron VX-6, OpDFrz 1964 and 1965.

===Leigh Hunt Glacier===
A glacier, long, flowing north-north-west to enter Brandau Glacier just west of Hare Peak. 
Named by the NZGSAE (1961-62) for A. Leigh Hunt, founder and first chairman of the New Zealand Antarctic Society.

===Snakeskin Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, flowing northwest to enter Keltie Glacier at the east side of Supporters Range. 
Named by NZGSAE (1961-62) as being descriptive of the ice and snow patterns observed on the glacier&#x27;s surface.

===Jensen Glacier===
A tributary glacier, about long, flowing north between Supporters Range and Lhasa Nunatak into Snakeskin Glacier.
Named by US-ACAN for Kenard H. Jensen, USARP meteorologist at South Pole Station, 1963.

===Falkenhof Glacier===
A tributary glacier long, flowing west from the vicinity of Tricorn Mountain to enter Snakeskin Glacier northwest of Mount Clarke. 
Named by US-ACAN for Jack J. Falkenhof, USARP meteorologist at South Pole Station, 1963.

===Laird Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, flowing northeast from the Supporters Range to enter Keltic Glacier southeast of Ranfurly Point. 
Named by US-ACAN for Robert J. Laird, USARP biologist at McMurdo Station, 1963.

<text>Michael Brendan McElroy (born May 18, 1939) is the Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies at Harvard University. His research initially revolved around the origin and evolution of the planets to an emphasis on effects of human activity on the global environment of the Earth, especially climate change.

From Northern Ireland originally, he was educated at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, receiving a B.Sc. in applied mathematics in 1960, and completing his Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1962. 

McElroy has worked in atmospheric science at Harvard, and leads atmospheric science and policy work. He heads Harvard University&#x27;s Center for the Environment and chairs the Interfaculty Initiative on the Environment. In 1984 he won the George Ledlie prize for his work on planetary atmospheres. He served as Founding Chair of Harvard&#x27;s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and has focused his research especially on effects of human activities on the global environment. 

He has recorded two audible books, &quot;The Modern Scholar: Global Warming, Global Threat&quot; (2004) and &quot;Fueling the Planet: The Past, Present, and Future of Energy&quot; (2009)

<text>&quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot; is the title of a public speech by human rights activist Malcolm X. In the speech, which was delivered on two occasions the first being April 3, 1964, at the Cory Methodist Church in Cleveland, Ohio, and the second being on April 12, 1964, at the King Solomon Baptist Church, in Detroit, Michigan, Malcolm X advised African Americans to judiciously exercise their right to vote, but he cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms. It was ranked 7th in the top 100 American speeches of the 20th century by 137 leading scholars of American public address.

==Background==

===Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam===
On March 8, 1964, Malcolm X announced his separation from the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist religious organization for which he had been the spokesman for nearly a decade. The Nation of Islam, which advocated on behalf of African Americans, had significant disagreements with the Civil Rights Movement. Whereas the Civil Rights Movement advocated on behalf of integration and against segregation, the Nation of Islam favored separatism. One of the goals of the Civil Rights Movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in the political process.

When he left the Nation of Islam, Malcolm declared his willingness to cooperate with the Civil Rights Movement. He reassured leaders of the Civil Rights Movement that &quot;I&#x27;ve forgotten everything bad that [they] have said about me, and I pray they can also forget the many bad things I&#x27;ve said about them.&quot;

===The Civil Rights Act of 1964===

In June 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent Congress a civil rights bill. The bill proposed a ban on discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or national origin in jobs and public accommodations. Southern Democrats (sometimes called Dixiecrats, though the term is ambiguous and more properly refers to a short-lived separate political party), blocked the bill from consideration by the House of Representatives.

After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson threw his support behind the civil rights bill. The bill was passed by the House on February 10, 1964, and sent to the Senate for consideration. Southern Democrats had promised to oppose the bill.

==The speech==
Malcolm X began his speech by acknowledging that he was still a Muslim, but he quickly added that he didn&#x27;t intend to discuss religion or any other issues that divide African Americans. Instead, he was going to emphasize the common experience of African Americans of all faiths:
===The ballot===
Malcolm X noted that 1964 was an election year, a year &quot;when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community ... with their false promises which they don&#x27;t intend to keep&quot;. He said that President Johnson and the Democratic Party claimed to support the civil rights bill, and the Democrats controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but they had not taken genuine action to pass the bill. Instead, he said, the Democrats blamed the Dixiecrats, who were &quot;nothing but Democrat[s] in disguise&quot;. He accused the Democrats of playing a &quot;political con game&quot;, with African Americans as its victims.

Malcolm said that African Americans were becoming &quot;politically mature&quot; and recognizing that, through unity and nonalignment, they could be the swing vote in the coming elections and elect candidates who would be attentive to their concerns:
Malcolm described how potent a weapon the ballot could be, if it was exercised with care:
===The government===
Although he advocated exercising the ballot, Malcolm X expressed skepticism that voting would bring about full equality for African Americans. The government, he said, &quot;is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of Black people in this country... This government has failed the Negro&quot;.

According to Malcolm, one of the ways in which the government had &quot;failed the Negro&quot; was its unwillingness to enforce the law. He pointed out that the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation (in cases such as &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; in 1944, &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; and &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot; in 1950, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954, and &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot; in 1960):
But, he said, the police department and local government often sided with segregationists against the Civil Rights Movement.

Malcolm said that relying on the federal government to force local governments to obey civil rights laws was futile. &quot;When you take your case to Washington, D.C., you&#x27;re taking it to the criminal who&#x27;s responsible; it&#x27;s like running from the wolf to the fox. They&#x27;re all in cahoots together&quot;.

===Human rights===
The proper solution, Malcolm X said, was to elevate the struggle of African Americans from one of civil rights to one of human rights. A fight for civil rights was a domestic matter, and &quot;no one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a civil-rights struggle&quot;.

Malcolm said that changing the fight for African American equality to a human rights issue changed it from a domestic problem to an international matter that could be heard by the United Nations. He contrasted civil rights, which he described as &quot;asking Uncle Sam to treat you right&quot;, to human rights, which he called &quot;your God-given rights&quot; and &quot;the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth&quot;. He said that the people of the developing world were &quot;sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side&quot; if the fight for civil rights were expanded into a human rights struggle&gt;
===Black nationalism===
Malcolm X described his continued commitment to black nationalism, which he defined as the philosophy that African Americans should govern their own communities. He said that Black nationalists believe that African Americans should control the politics and the economy in their communities and that they need to remove the vices, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, that afflict their communities.

Malcolm said that the philosophy of Black nationalism was being taught in the major civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, CORE, and SNCC.

Black nationalism was characterized by its political, social, and economic philosophies. The political philosophy is self-government. The local governments of the African American communities should be managed by African Americans. African Americans should be &quot;re-educated into the science of politics&quot; in order to understand the importance and effect of the vote they cast:
The economic philosophy of black nationalism promotes African American control of the economy of the African American community. In frequenting stores not owned by an African American, the money is given to another community. The dollar is taken from the African American community and given to outsiders. In doing so, the African American community loses money and becomes poorer while the community the dollar was given to gains money and becomes richer. Therefore, stores in the African American community should be run by African Americans:
The social philosophy of black nationalism advocates for reform of the community and reconstruction of it so it is more welcoming:
Most of all, Malcolm promoted unity:
===Self-defense===
Malcolm X addressed the issue of &quot;rifles and shotguns&quot;, a controversy that had dogged him since his March 8 announcement that he had left the Nation of Islam. He reiterated his position that if the government is &quot;unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes&quot;, African Americans should defend themselves. He advised his listeners to be mindful of the law — &quot;This doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks ... that would be illegal and we don&#x27;t do anything illegal&quot; — but he said that if white people didn&#x27;t want African Americans to arm themselves, the government should do its job.

===The bullet===
Malcolm X referred to &quot;the type of Black man on the scene in America today [who] doesn&#x27;t intend to turn the other cheek any longer&quot;, and warned that if politicians failed to keep their promises to African Americans, they made violence inevitable:
Malcolm predicted that if the civil rights bill wasn&#x27;t passed, there would be a march on Washington in 1964. Unlike the 1963 March on Washington, which was peaceful and integrated, the 1964 march Malcolm described would be an all-Black &quot;non-nonviolent army&quot; with one-way tickets.

But, Malcolm said, there was still time to prevent this situation from developing:
==Analysis==
&quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot; served several purposes at a critical point in Malcolm X&#x27;s life: it was part of his effort to distance himself from the Nation of Islam, and it was intended to reach out to moderate civil rights leaders. At the same time, the speech indicated that Malcolm still supported Black nationalism and self-defense and thus had not made a complete break with his past. &quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot; also marked a notable shift in Malcolm X&#x27;s rhetoric, as he presented previously undiscussed ways of looking at the relationship between blacks and whites.

===Separation from the Nation of Islam===
In its advocacy of voting, &quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot; presented ideas opposite to those of the Nation of Islam, which forbade its members from participating in the political process.

Malcolm also chose not to discuss the religious differences that divide Muslims and Christians, a common theme of his speeches when he was the spokesman for the Nation of Islam. In &quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot;, Malcolm chose not to discuss religion but rather to stress the experiences common to African Americans of all backgrounds.

===Black nationalism===
When Malcolm X spoke of &quot;the type of Black man on the scene in America today [who] doesn&#x27;t intend to turn the other cheek any longer&quot;, he was addressing his followers, people who were not advocates of the non-violent approach generally favored by the Civil Rights Movement. Likewise, by stating his continued commitment to Black nationalism, Malcolm reassured his followers that he had not made a complete break with his past.

One biographer notes that Malcolm was one of the first African American leaders to note the existence and growing influence of Black nationalism among young civil rights activists.

===Rhetoric===
&quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot; further indicates a shift in Malcolm X&#x27;s rhetoric, as his separation from the Nation of Islam and new, unfettered public activism prompted a change in the ways he addressed his audience. Malcolm X maintained his use of repetition as &quot;communications of the passion that is satisfied by a single statement, but that beats through the pulses&quot;, and this can be exemplified by his consistent use of the phrase &quot;the ballot or the bullet&quot;. In addition, Malcolm X intended his characteristic use of language and imagery to disguise his conceptions of society and history in new ways to put issues into his perspective for his audience and inspire activism. The most significant modification of Malcolm X&#x27;s rhetoric that can be observed in &quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot; is the broadening of his audience, as he &quot;emphasizes individualized judgement rather than group cohesion&quot; and allows for more analytical &quot;flexibility restrained by a purposive focus on particular goals.&quot; These changes expanded his appeal, therefore expanding his audience, illustrating his ability to use the freedom he found after separating from the Nation of Islam to his advantage in advancing himself as a member of the Civil Rights Movement.

Depending on the capsaicin content in bell peppers and the amount of added chili peppers, it can be sweet (traditional), piquant (the most common), or very hot. Ajvar can be consumed as a bread spread or as a side dish. Ajvar has a few variations. One variation contains tomato and eggplant, and another green bell peppers and oregano.

&quot;Homemade Leskovac Ajvar&quot; and &quot;Macedonian Ajvar&quot; are registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization in order to protect their brand names.

==Etymology and origin==
The name &quot;ajvar&quot; comes from the Turkish word , which means &quot;salted roe, caviar&quot; and shares an etymology with &quot;caviar&quot;, coming from the Persian word . Before the 20th century, significant local production of caviar occurred on the Danube, with sturgeon swimming from the Black Sea up to Belgrade. Domestic , meaning &quot;caviar&quot;, used to be a very popular dish in Belgrade homes and restaurants, but the domestic production of caviar became unsteady in the 1890s because of labor disputes. Eventually a special pepper salad was offered as a substitute in Belgrade restaurants under the name &quot;red ajvar&quot; () or &quot;Serbian ajvar&quot; ().

==Preparation==
Homemade ajvar is made of peppers that are roasted, minced, and then cooked, but some industrial producers use fresh minced peppers, which are only cooked with sunflower oil afterwards, which leads to lower quality. Ajvar preparation is somewhat difficult, because it requires considerable manual labour, particularly for peeling the roasted peppers. It is traditionally prepared in mid-autumn, when peppers are most abundant, and preserved in glass jars for consumption throughout the year. Anecdotally, most households&#x27; stocks do not last until the spring, when fresh vegetables become available, so it is usually enjoyed as a winter food. Entire families or neighbours often gather to prepare the peppers together. The traditional cultivar of pepper used is called &quot;roga&quot; (approx. &quot;horn&quot;). &quot;Roga&quot; is large, red, horn-shaped and relatively easy to peel, with thick flesh. It typically ripens in late September.

To produce ajvar, fresh peppers are roasted whole on a plate above an open fire, a plate of wood in a stove, or in an oven. The baked peppers must briefly cool to allow the flesh to separate from the skin. Next, the skin is carefully peeled off and the seeds are removed. The peppers are then ground in a mill or chopped into tiny pieces (this variant is often referred to as pindjur). Finally, the resulting mash is stewed for several hours in large pots. Sunflower oil is added at this stage to condense and reduce the water, and to enhance later preservation. Salt is added at the end (sometimes alongside vinegar), and the hot mush is poured directly into sterilized glass jars, which are sealed immediately.

==Production==

Ajvar is produced in most Balkan countries, including Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Slovenia and Serbia. Serbia&#x27;s reported annual production is 640 tons.

Ajvar is often included as part of &quot;zimnica&quot; (winter foods), which include pickled chili peppers, pickled tomatoes, and anything else that can be preserved in a jar just before winter.

<text>Samuel Chapman Armstrong (January 30, 1839 – May 11, 1893) was an American soldier and general during the American Civil War who later became an educator, particularly of non-whites. The son of missionaries in Hawaii, he rose through the Union Army during the American Civil War to become a general, leading units of Black American soldiers. He became best known as an educator, founding and becoming the first principal of the normal school for Black American and later Native American pupils in Virginia which later became Hampton University. He also founded the university&#x27;s museum, the Hampton University Museum, which is the oldest Black American museum in the country, and the oldest museum in Virginia.

==Early and family life==
The third son of Christian missionary Richard Armstrong (1805–1860), Armstrong was born in Wailuku, Maui, Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, the sixth of ten children, eight of whom reached adulthood. His mother, Clarissa Chapman Armstrong, grew up in a Congregational family in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. His father was a Presbyterian minister sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which was founded by several Williams College graduates associated with various Protestant denominations. His parents were among the first missionaries to what were then known as the Sandwich Islands. Arriving in 1832, they established several Christian congregations on various Hawai&#x27;ian islands. In 1840, after the death of experienced missionary [eh?], Richard Armstrong became the second shepherd of Kawaiahaʻo Church, in Honolulu, on Oʻahu, when Samuel was an infant. Many chiefs and their families attended the historic church (which received its current name in 1853, under Richard Armstrong). Richard Armstrong also served on the kingdom&#x27;s privy council and became the Minister of Education and later the Superintendent of Public Instruction. He established schools throughout the kingdom, and emphasized learning a manual trade in addition to farming. He graduated students proficient in blacksmithing, carpentry, and barrel-making, in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic.

Like many children of missionaries and tribal leaders, Samuel attended Punahou School and the associated Oahu College, in Honolulu, for his elementary education. There is a bronze plaque at Punahou commemorating him as a &quot;Son of Punahou&quot;. After finishing at Punahou, he became his father&#x27;s secretary. After his father suffered a horseback-riding accident and died, in 1860, Samuel Armstrong, aged 21, followed his father&#x27;s wishes and sailed from Hawaiʻi for the United States, to begin his own studies at Williams College, in Massachusetts. He graduated in 1862.

Armstrong married Emma Dean Walker, of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on October 13, 1869. She died on November 10, 1878, after giving birth to two daughters, Louise H. Armstrong Scoville and Edith E. Armstrong, both of whom taught briefly at the Hampton Institute (where Louise&#x27;s husband, William Scoville, served for decades as a trustee). He remained a widower for more than a decade. Armstrong remarried in Montpelier, Vermont, on September 10, 1890, to Mary Alice Ford, a teacher at the Hampton Institute. Their son, Daniel Armstrong, became a career U.S. Naval officer and commanded the Negro Recruit Training Program at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, near Waukegan, Illinois, during World War II. Their daughter, Margaret Armstrong, married the Hampton&#x27;s Institute&#x27;s president during the Great Depression, Arthur Howe; their sons served as trustees from the 1950s into the 1970s.

==Civil War==
During Samuel Armstrong&#x27;s studies at Williams College, the American Civil War divided the United States. Like his father, Armstrong supported the abolition of slavery but considered himself a Hawaiian. Nonetheless, on August 15, shortly after graduating with future General and President James A. Garfield, Armstrong volunteered to serve in the Union Army. By August 26, he had recruited a company near Troy, New York, and received the rank of captain in the 125th New York Infantry, a three-years regiment in George L. Willard&#x27;s brigade. Within weeks Armstrong and his troops were among the 12,000 man garrison at Harpers Ferry, who though without combat training initially held their position during the Confederate Maryland Campaign on September 13, 1862, but were surrendered two days later by career U.S. Army officer Dixon S. Miles (who was rumored to have been killed by his own men that day, but officially died as a result of enemy fire) to Confederate General Stonewall Jackson shortly before the Battle of Antietam.

After being paroled in a prisoner exchange, Capt. Armstrong returned to the front lines in Virginia in December. The following summer, as part of the 3rd Division of the II Corps under Alexander Hays Armstrong fought at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, defending Cemetery Ridge against Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Armstrong subsequently received a promotion to major on August 26, 1863 (but effective July 3, 1863, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg).

Armstrong volunteered to lead African-American troops, resigned from his New York unit, and received the rank of lieutenant colonel, and assignment to the 9th United States Colored Infantry (USCT) in November 1863. When Armstrong was assigned to command the USCT, training was conducted at Camp Stanton near Benedict, Maryland. While at Camp Stanton, Armstrong established a school to educate the black soldiers, most of whom had no education as slaves.

Lt. Col. Armstrong was then assigned to lead the 8th U.S. Colored Troops when its previous commander fell wounded. Armstrong&#x27;s experiences in Hawai&#x27;i and with these regiments aroused his interest in the welfare of black Americans. Armstrong noted that Hawaiians J. R. Kealoha and Kaiwi were privates in different USCT regiments. Armstrong led the 8th Regiment during the Siege of Petersburg, and his troops became one of the first Union regiments to enter the city after the Confederates withdrew from their trenches.

In November 1864, Armstrong received a promotion to Colonel &quot;for gallant and meritorious services at Deep Bottom and Fussell&#x27;s Mill&quot; during the Siege of Petersburg. The 8th USCT pursued the Army of Northern Virginia during the subsequent Appomattox Campaign.

After Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, Armstrong and his men returned to Petersburg briefly, before being sent by sea to Ringgold Barracks near Rio Grande City on the Mexican border in Texas. On October 10, 1865, the 8th USCT began marching from Texas to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Armstrong and his men were discharged out of the military on November 10, 1865, shortly after their belated arrival.

On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Armstrong for the award of the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the new commission on March 12, 1866.

==Educator==

At the war&#x27;s end, Armstrong joined the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. With the help of the American Missionary Association, he established the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute—now known as Hampton University—in Hampton, Virginia, in 1868. The institute was meant to be a place where black students could receive post-secondary education to become teachers, as well as training in useful job skills while paying for their education through manual labor, as his father had advocated back in Hawai&#x27;i.
During Armstrong&#x27;s career, and during Reconstruction, the prevailing concept of racial adjustment promoted by whites and African Americans equated technical and industrial training with the advancement of the black race. This idea was not a new solution and traced its history to before the American Civil War. But especially after the war, blacks and whites alike realized the paradox that freedom posed for the African American population in the racist south. Freedom meant liberation from the brutality and degradation of slavery, but as W. E. B. Du Bois described it, a black person &quot;felt his poverty; without a cent, without a home, without land, tools, or savings, he had entered into competition with rich, landed, skilled neighbors. To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships.&quot; Although the end of slavery was the inevitable result of the Union victory, less obvious was the fate of millions of penniless blacks in the South. Former abolitionists and white philanthropists quickly focused their energies on stabilizing the black community, assisting the newly freed blacks to become independent, positive contributors to their community, helping them improve their race and encouraging them to strive toward a standard put forth by American whites.

In the aftermath of Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion in 1831, the Virginia General Assembly passed new legislation making it unlawful to teach slaves, free blacks, or mulattoes to read or write. Similar laws were also enacted in other slave-holding states across the South. The removal of these laws after the Civil War helped draw attention to the problem of illiteracy as one of the great challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the free enterprise system and support themselves.

One instrument through which this process of racial uplift could take place was schools such as the Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute. The Hampton Institute exemplified the paternalistic attitudes of whites who felt it was their duty to develop those they regarded as lesser races. General Samuel Armstrong molded the curriculum to reflect his background as both a wartime abolitionist and the child of white missionaries in Hawaii. Armstrong believed that several centuries of the institution of slavery in the United States had left its blacks in an inferior moral state and only whites could help them develop to the point of American civilization. &quot;The solution lay in a Hampton-style education, an education that combined cultural uplift with moral and manual training, or as Armstrong was fond of saying, an education that encompassed &#x27;the head, the heart, and the hands.&#x27;&quot; The general insisted that blacks should refrain from voting and politics because their long experience as slaves and, before that, pagans, had degraded the race beyond responsible participation in government. &quot;Armstrong maintained that it was the duty of the superior white race to rule over the weaker dark-skinned races until they were appropriately civilized. This civilization process, in Armstrong&#x27;s estimate, would require several generations of moral and religious development.&quot; The primary means through which white civilization could be instilled in African Americans was by the moral power of labor and manual industry.

At the heart of the early Hampton-style education during Armstrong&#x27;s tenure was this emphasis on labor and industry. However, teaching blacks to work was a tool, not the primary goal, of the institute. Rather than producing classes of individual craftsmen and laborers, Hampton was ultimately a normal school (teacher&#x27;s school) for future black teachers. In theory, these black teachers would then apply the Hampton idea of self-help and industry at schools throughout the U.S., especially the South. To this end, a prerequisite for admission to Hampton was the intent to become a teacher. In fact, &quot;approximately 84 per cent of the 723 graduates of Hampton&#x27;s first twenty classes became teachers.&quot; Armstrong strove to instill in these disciples the moral value of manual labor. This concept became the crucial component of Hampton&#x27;s training of black educators.
Perhaps the best student of Armstrong&#x27;s Hampton-style education was Booker T. Washington. After coming to the school in 1872, Washington immediately began to adopt Armstrong&#x27;s teaching and philosophy. Washington described Armstrong as &quot;the most perfect specimen of man, physically, mentally and spiritually the most Christ-like….&quot; Washington also quickly learned the aim of the Hampton Institute. After leaving Hampton, he recalled being admitted to the school, despite his ragged appearance, due to the ability he demonstrated while sweeping and dusting a room. From his first day at Hampton, Washington embraced Armstrong&#x27;s idea of black education.

Washington went on to attend Wayland Seminary in Washington, D.C., and he returned to Hampton to teach on Armstrong&#x27;s faculty. Upon Sam Armstrong&#x27;s recommendation to George W. Campbell, Lewis Adams, and Mirabeau B. Swanson, a three-man board of commissioners appointed by the Alabama Legislature, Booker Washington became in 1881 the first principal of the new normal school in Alabama, which evolved to become Tuskegee University in the 20th century. Many religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired by the work of pioneering educators such as Samuel Armstrong and Dr. Washington, to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans in the South.

In his autobiography &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, Booker T. Washington stated that what made the greatest impression on him at Hampton was General Samuel C. Armstrong, &quot;the noblest, rarest human being that it has ever been my privilege to meet.&quot; &quot;One might have removed from Hampton all the buildings, classrooms, teachers, and industries, and given the men and women there the opportunity of coming into daily contact with General Armstrong, and that alone would have been a liberal education.&quot; (&quot;Up from Slavery&quot;, Chapter III)

==Death and legacy==
Partially disabled by a stroke while on a speaking tour in 1892, Armstrong returned to Hampton in a private railroad car provided by his multimillionaire friend, Collis P. Huntington, builder of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, with whom he had collaborated on black-education projects. Armstrong died at the Hampton Institute on May 11, 1893, after suffering a second stroke. His widow returned to New England. As discussed in the family section above, all his daughters would be associated with Hampton University, and his son Daniel Armstrong would become a career Naval officer and train African American troops during World War II. His grandson, Harold Howe II, became Commissioner of Education under the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson. His papers (and those of some family members) are held by the Special Collections division of the Williams College library.

===Growth and decline of Normal Schools===

As the ever-increasing numbers of new teachers went back to their communities, by the first third of the 20th century, over 5,000 local schools had been built for blacks in the South with private matching funds provided by individuals such as Henry H. Rogers, Andrew Carnegie, and most notably, Julius Rosenwald, each of whom had arisen from modest roots to become wealthy. Dr. Washington later wrote that, by requiring matching funds, the benefactors felt they were also addressing self-esteem. The recipients locally would have a stake in knowing that they were helping themselves through their own hard work and sacrifice. In many communities, the histories of the so-called Rosenwald schools reflect that to have proved true.

In time, the normal schools which had been originally established primarily to work with blacks at Hampton, Tuskegee, and elsewhere evolved from their primary focus on industrial training, practical skills, and basic literacy, into institutions of higher education focused not only upon training teachers, but upon teaching diverse academic subjects. Many of those institutions evolved into fully accredited universities.

===Namesakes===
Armstrong High School in Richmond, Virginia, was named after Armstrong in 1909.

Armstrong Manual Training School in Washington, D.C., was named for him in 1902. It was renamed Veterans High School in 1958, and then the Armstrong Adult Education Center in 1964. It currently hosts Friendship Armstrong Academy.

US Army Fort Armstrong, (Hawaii) built just before World War I, was a coastal artillery battery guarding Honolulu harbor.
Part of the land was used for the Prince Kuhio Federal Building. Other parts of Fort Armstrong became a container terminal for military supplies, which still uses the name.
A building and alumni award for humanitarian contributions were named for him at Punahou School.

Armstrong Hall (Science Building) at Tuskegee University was named after Armstrong in 1929.

<text>A Shabbat elevator is an elevator which works in a special mode, operating automatically, to satisfy the Jewish law requiring Jews to abstain from operating electrical switches on Shabbat (the Sabbath). These are also known as Sabbath or Shabbos elevators.

==Description and history==
Jewish law forbids those who observe it from undertaking various forms of &quot;work&quot; on the Sabbath, including that they may not create sparks or fires. In recent times, this has been extrapolated to also cover the operation of electrical equipment.

An elevator may be marked with a sign noting that it is specially configured for Shabbat observance. There are several ways the elevator works (going up and down), stopping at every floor, stopping at alternate floors, or rising to the top floor and stopping, while going down.

Shabbat elevators can be found in areas of large Jewish population in Israel, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ukraine (Dnipro), Argentina, and Brazil. They are found in hotels, hospitals and other health institutions, apartment buildings, and sometimes in synagogues.

The Israeli Knesset passed a special Shabbat elevator law in 2001, ordering the planning and building of all residential buildings, and public buildings which have more than one elevator, to install a control mechanism for Shabbat (Shabbat module) in one of the elevators.

In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step in and out without having to press any buttons. Otherwise, Jewish law prohibits observers from using an elevator on Shabbat in the usual manner, because pressing the button to operate the elevator closes a circuit, which is one of the activities prohibited on Shabbat and may also indirectly lead to &quot;writing&quot; of the new floor number in the display.

In 2009, some Haredi rabbis, led by Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, published a religious injunction forbidding the use of Shabbat elevators.

Some interpreters believe that a non-Jew known as a &quot;Shabbos goy&quot; may not be employed to press the buttons and hold the door for Jews in buildings that do not have Shabbat elevators, unless the Jew has great difficulty using the stairs themselves. As discussed in that article, a non-Jew is not expected to keep the Sabbath like a Jew. Therefore, Jewish law holds that a Jew may benefit from work performed by a non-Jew only if the non-Jew performs this work for his own good and of his own free will.

A borderline case is when a Jew hints to a non-Jew that they would like them to perform a certain service without explicitly asking. These borderline cases are not considered legitimate by many Orthodox rabbis.

<doc id="1157973" wikidata="Q7576033" url="?curid=1157973" title="Spencer Dock">
<text>Spencer Dock () is a former wharf area, close to where the Royal Canal meets the River Liffey, in the North Wall area of Dublin, Ireland. As of the 21st century, the area has been redeveloped with occupants of the Spencer Dock development including the Convention Centre Dublin, PricewaterhouseCoopers&#x27; Irish headquarters, Credit Suisse and TMF Group. The Central Bank of Ireland and NTMA have offices in the nearby Dublin Landings development.

The main building in the area was previously the former North Wall railway station which formed the terminus bringing goods and passengers to the quays.

==History==
The dockland area was originally part of the end of the Royal Canal, which still reaches the River Liffey here. 
===1873 docks complex===
The dock was constructed in 1873 to accommodate the coal ships and other barges primarily of the Midland Great Western Railway Company and served as both a railway and canal depot. The original Sheriff Street Drawbridge was constructed in 1873 but replaced by the Sheriff Street Lifting Bridge in 1941.

The name relates to John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; who opened the docks complex in 1873; conferring a knighthood on MGWR chairman Ralph Cusack at the same time.

===Modern Spencer Dock development===

Most of the 206,000 m2 (51 acre) site now known as &quot;Spencer Dock&quot; was owned by Córas Iompair Éireann for much of the 20th century. With increasing land values in the early 2000s and as the freight yards became surplus to requirements, it sold the land on to Treasury Holdings while retaining a 17.5% interest in the freehold. CIÉ later also sold its minority holding to a property fund managed by Davy Group. All 614 apartments in the development were sold to private buyers.

Following the appointment of receivers over the office property, the office complex was sold in its entirety for €242m in 2016. 

==Geography==
The original area was Spencer Dock area was defined by a ribbon of development from the Liffey along the Royal Canal up to about the Main Dublin to Belfast railway line, the two parts of Spencer Dock being separated by the bridge at Sheriff Street and separated from the Liffey by a sea lock. The modern development is defined as being part of the North Wall area of Dublin Docklands. The Point Village area lies to the east with Dublin Docklands claiming to be a small area between the two. One focal point of the area is the Luas tram stop and the adjacent park.

==Infrastructure==
===Rail===
Spencer Dock is served by the Docklands railway station on Sheriff Street, at the north end of the site. Commuter services to the Dublin Docklands area on the Western Commuter line began in March 2007. Under the Transport 21 initiative, at one time due for completion by 2018, the station was to move south to a permanent location along New Wapping Street. This station, proposed to connect to an extended Luas Red line, was deferred due to the Post-2008 Irish economic downturn.

===Luas===

The Luas Red Line which runs from Tallaght or Saggart to The Point (via Busáras and Heuston railway station) has a stop for Spencer Dock.

===Dublin Bikes===
In 2014, two Dublin Bikes stations were opened, one at Guild Street and another at the convention centre.

===Bridges===
The Sheriff Street Lifting Bridge was installed between 1939 and 1941. A single-span bascule bridge, it replaces the earlier James Price designed swivel bridge of 1873 which was the first mechanical crossing of Spencer Dock, and separated its inner and outer portions.

The Spencer Dock Bridge carries road, Luas and pedestrian traffic from Dublin over the Royal Canal into the Spencer Dock area. The Spencer Dock Luas stop is some 200m to the east. The bridge 200m north of where the Royal Canal meets the Liffey, while the Sheriff Street Lifting bridge carrying the R101 road is a further 160m north. The bridge has a shallow desk of just thick while the width varies from to .

<text>The Marietta and Cincinnati (M&amp;C) was one of five important east-west railroads of southern Ohio; it was later absorbed by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O). Its original route ran from Marietta through Vincent, Athens, Hamden, Chillicothe, Greenfield, Blanchester, and Loveland. It had two main branches: Blanchester to Hillsboro, which was originally part of the Hillsboro and Cincinnati Railroad; and Hamden to Portsmouth, Ohio, originally part of the Scioto and Hocking Valley Railroad.
==History==
The M&amp;C was founded as the Belpre and Cincinnati Railroad (B&amp;C) in 1845 The destination of the B&amp;C was changed from Belpre to Marietta, Ohio, and in 1851 the name of the railroad was changed to The Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad. The M&amp;C reached Loveland, Ohio by 1857. The company entered bankruptcy in 1858, from which it emerged in 1860. The first through-train from Cincinnati, using the tracks of The Little Miami Railroad to reach Loveland, ran on April 9, 1857.

An extension of the right-of-way from Marietta upriver to Bellaire, Ohio, to enable a connection across the Ohio River with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Wheeling, Virginia, had been largely graded with stone culverts constructed by the 1858 bankruptcy. Construction stopped. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) later purchased the right-of-way between Bellaire and Marietta.

The Northwestern Virginia Railroad, financed and controlled by the B&amp;O, was built from a junction with the B&amp;O mainline at Grafton, Virginia to Parkersburg,
Virginia and opened May 1, 1857. The M&amp;C operated a ferry for the 14 miles downriver from Marietta to Parkersburg, so that travelers and freight could be transferred between the systems.

With help from the B&amp;O and the Baltimore City Council, the Union Railroad was built from Scott&#x27;s Landing (Moore&#x27;s Junction), three miles south of Marietta on the Ohio River, to Belpre in 1860. It was operated by the M&amp;C. This section of track is still in operation (2012) with unit coal trains providing most of the traffic.

Between 1864 and 1866, the M&amp;C built its own line from Loveland through Madeira, Madisonville, Norwood, and Spring Grove to a connection with The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad at Winton Place. This line opened on February 18, 1866

The Cincinnati and Baltimore Railway was chartered in 1868 and was built six miles down the east bank of Mill Creek from Spring Grove to downtown Cincinnati. This line was opened on June 1, 1872 and was &quot;transferred on that day, under a contract for a perpetual lease&quot; to the M&amp;C.

The Baltimore Short Line Railway was chartered in 1870 to build from Warren&#x27;s Station (east of Athens) 30 miles to Belpre. It opened on November 15, 1874. It was built to afford lower operating and maintenance costs as well as a shorter route to Belpre. This line followed the Hocking River through Canaanville, Guysville and Stewart. It went through Coolville Station, Torch and Belpre. This became the mainline route of the M&amp;C and later the B&amp;O.

In December 1876, service on the &quot;Old Line&quot; from Warren&#x27;s Station to a connection with the old Union Railroad at Scott&#x27;s Landing was discontinued. It duplicated the Baltimore Short Line and was considered dangerous, steep and difficult to maintain, as it had many trestles and tunnels.

The Marietta &amp; Cincinnati Railroad became the Cincinnati, Washington and Baltimore Railroad on February 16, 1883. On December 20, 1889 the C.W.&amp;B. became The Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad.

The Marietta Mineral Railway was incorporated in February 1882 to restore operations on the &quot;old line between Scott&#x27;s Landing (Moore&#x27;s Junction) and Big Run, northeast of Warren&#x27;s. In October of 1884 trains were put into operation between Flemming Station and Marietta. This constituted 7 miles of the old line to Moore&#x27;s Junction and three miles of the old Union line to Marietta. The remaining 15 miles to Big Run was put into operation in June 1885.&quot;This section was known for its many accidents. The name was changed to the Marietta, Columbus and Cleveland Railroad (MC&amp;C) in December 1900 and operated to about 1917. The east end operated as the Marietta and Vincent Railroad Company until abandoned in 1924.

The rest of the line from Canaanville westward was acquired and operated for many years by B&amp;O Railroad. The section from eastern Vinton County to Belpre was abandoned in the 1980s and the right-of-way sold off. Today, the portion from Mineral, Ohio to the end of the now-operating line south of Zaleski, Ohio is the Moonville Rail-Trail.

William P. Cutler was an important figure in the development of the M&amp;C. He also was a backer of the Union Railroad and the Marietta Mineral, among other local railroads. Cutler served as General Manager and as President of the M&amp;C for many years.

<text>Madlyn Soloman Rhue (née Madeline Roche), (October 3, 1935 – December 16, 2003) was an American film and television actress.

==Early life and education==
Rhue was born in Washington, D.C., graduated from Los Angeles High School, and studied drama at Los Angeles City College.

==Entertainment career==
Rhue debuted in show business at age 17 as a dancer at the Copacabana night club in New York City. At that time she decided to create a stage name for herself by adapting the title of the film &quot;13 Rue Madeleine&quot; (1947). From the 1950s to the 1990s, she appeared in some 20 films, including &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959); &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (1961); &quot;A Majority of One&quot; (1961); &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963); &quot;Kenner&quot; (1969); and &quot;Stand Up and Be Counted&quot; (1972).

Rhue guest-starred in dozens of television series, beginning with &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (1955). She played Ricardo Montalbán&#x27;s wife in a 1960 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Day of Reckoning&quot;. That year, she also played the title role of Marian Ames in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Wayward Wife&quot; and appeared in &quot;Route 66&quot; Season 3 Episode 9.

Later in the 1960s, her appearances included &quot;Stagecoach West&quot; (1961), &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1963), &quot;The Defenders&quot; (1965) in &quot;Whipping Boy&quot; as Christine Knox and the classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Space Seed&quot; (1967) where she once again appeared opposite Ricardo Montalbán (who played Khan Noonien Singh) playing his love interest Lt. Marla McGivers.

Rhue played regulars Marjorie Grant in &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot; (1969–70) and Hilary Madison in &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1976–77). Other guest appearances included &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (S5E15). &quot;Tag You&#x27;re It&quot;. &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (as Consuela Sandino in episode &quot;The Dark Pool&quot;), &quot;Route 66&quot; (as Ara Rados in the episode, &quot;Every Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot;)&quot;, The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Rebel&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Longstreet&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (as Georgia in &quot;Angels on the Street&quot; in 1979) and &quot;Fame&quot; (as Angela Schwartz). She also appeared in the television movie &quot;Goldie and the Boxer&quot;, and made appearances on the game show &quot;Match Game&quot; during 1974–1976.

In the early 1960s, Rhue was injured in an automobile accident that resulted in lost teeth and a cut lower lip. She was hospitalized before returning to acting.

In 1962, Rhue married actor Tony Young and acted with him in the Western &quot;He Rides Tall&quot;. They divorced in 1970.

=== Multiple sclerosis and later entertainment career ===
In 1977, Rhue was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She continued to work, including a role in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, but by 1985, Rhue&#x27;s legs had become so weak from the multiple sclerosis that she could only get around by wheelchair. Once becoming a wheelchair user, Rhue described feelings of fear and anxiety over being unable to land on-screen work in the entertainment industry for a period of 11 months. Regarding the matter, she was quoted as stating, &quot;It became apparent that I would have to invent a giant accident to explain the wheelchair or start telling the truth.&quot;

Despite being reliant on a wheelchair, Rhue managed to resume her entertainment career and was praised by media outlets for not allowing her health issues to disrupt her career. She played intermittent roles that did not require her to walk or stand, sometimes incorporating the wheelchair as part of the character. For example, she played a wheelchair-using ballistics expert on the CBS police-based legal drama, &quot;Houston Knights&quot;. She also played a judge role in the scripted court show, &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, lasting only the 1989–90 television season. She performed the role in a wheelchair, unseen to viewers as she presided from the judge&#x27;s bench. Her part as a female judge was uncharacteristic for court shows, the genre dominated by men performing the judge role to that point. She also performed a recurring role in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, said to be her last television role. Angela Lansbury created a role for her when she heard that Rhue was at risk of losing her health insurance because she could no longer work enough hours.

Contrary to rumors, her illness apparently had nothing to do with her not reprising the &quot;Star Trek&quot; role of Lt. Marla McGivers in the film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). At the time of the film&#x27;s production start in late 1981, Rhue was still mobile and appearing in television roles, but hiding her diagnosis for fear of it impacting her career. Director Nicholas Meyer stated that he wrote McGivers out of his drafts of the film (with a line referencing the character&#x27;s death) in order to give the Khan character additional motivation for seeking vengeance.

In 1991, in her last movie, she played a wheelchair-using character in the made for television thriller &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Justice&quot;.

== Death ==
Rhue eventually became completely incapacitated by multiple sclerosis and died from pneumonia at the age of 68 at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles, California.

== Religion and politics ==
Rhue adhered to Judaism outside of her marriage to Young, during which she partook in Catholicism. She was also a registered Republican who supported the administrations of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush.

<text>Busseto (Bussetano: ; Parmigiano: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Parma, in Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy with about inhabitants. Its history is quite well documented back to the 10th century, and for almost five hundred years it was the capital of Stato Pallavicino, which eventually became part of the Duchy of Parma. The town is about south of Cremona in Lombardy.

==Etymology==
The first written sources give the name as &quot;Buxetum&quot; in the early twelfth century. As such it appears the town&#x27;s name is cognate with:
*buxus as in common box, buxus sempervirens, cognate with places such as Bushey; or
*busetum – a shott, fold or pen (fenced clearing) for oxen, cognate with places such as Oxpens.

==Municipal palace and galleried theatre==
The town hosts La Rocca, on the site of the founding fortress of Adalberto Pallavicini, scion of his family, in the eleventh century. In the first half of the thirteenth century, it was laid out afresh to figure a moat and a drawbridge facing the square. Successive damage which lost the drawbridge and parts of the walls was followed by alterations and partial rebuilding. In 1857 its bulk was rebuilt almost entirely in neo-Gothic style – under theatre architect Pier Luigi Montecchini (b., d. ). Its present form has preserved the 13th century keep and the main tower. La Rocca, within which lies the Teatro Verdi, it is now the Municipal Palace, the seat of the municipality of Busseto.

==Notable residents==
Opera composer Giuseppe Verdi was born in the nearby village of Le Roncole in 1813 and he moved to the town in 1824. Other figures from the world of opera are associated with the town: until his death, retired tenor Carlo Bergonzi owned the hotel &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, which also hosts the &quot;Accademia Verdiana&quot;. Bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni grew up there from the age of four after his family moved to Busseto in 1979, where his father owned a car-repair firm and his mother was a teacher. It was in that town where, he noted, &quot;you feel Verdi&#x27;s spirit all over the place!&quot;
and where his love of opera began. Italian journalist Giovannino Guareschi also lived in Le Roncole, and his &quot;Mondo Piccolo&quot; is set there.

Doctor Claudio Carosino was born in Busseto. The hospital in Busseto is named after him.

== Main sites associated with Giuseppe Verdi ==


In the town and locally many sites linked to the life of Verdi can be visited. These include:

===Le Roncole===
The nearby village of Le Roncole was Verdi&#x27;s birthplace on 10 October 1813. The house has been a national monument since 1901.

===Casa Barezzi===
Close by the main square is the home of Antonio Barezzi, the man who supported his early endeavours. He became Verdi&#x27;s patron and his father-in-law. In the upstairs lounge, the young Verdi gave his first public performance in 1830 and continued to frequent the house until the death of his benefactor.

The first portrait of Verdi and an oil depicting Antonio are on display in the house. Verdi&#x27;s letters are displayed. This house is the headquarters of the Friends of Verdi; the organization oversaw the restoration of the building in 1979 and 1998. Since 2001, there has been a permanent exhibition of objects and documents related to Verdi and his relationship to the Barezzis.

===Busseto churches where Verdi played the organ===
These two of Busseto&#x27;s ten churches (&quot;chiese&quot;) were where Verdi played the organ. Santa Maria degli Angeli has its own article as does .

===Palazzo Orlandi===
This is the large, ornate house which Verdi bought in 1845. He lived there with Giuseppina Strepponi, not yet his wife, from 1849 to 1851. Verdi composed &quot;Luisa Miller&quot;, &quot;Stiffelio&quot; and &quot;Rigoletto&quot; while living there.

===Teatro Giuseppe Verdi===
The Teatro Giuseppe Verdi is a small 300-seat theatre built by the municipality without Verdi&#x27;s prior approval however he donated towards its completion.

===National Museum of Giuseppe Verdi===
The National Museum of Giuseppe Verdi is housed at the Renaissance Villa Pallavicino;
it was inaugurated on 10, October 2009, the 196th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth.

===Villa Verdi===
In the nearby village of Sant&#x27;Agata, in the province of Piacenza, is the Villa Verdi, the house which he commissioned in 1848 while living in Busseto and where his parents lived until 1851, after which it became Verdi&#x27;s main home for the rest of his life. He lived there less frequently after the death of his wife, Giuseppina, in 1897.

== Transportation ==
Busseto has a railway station on the Cremona–Fidenza line.

<doc id="1158000" wikidata="Q406599" url="?curid=1158000" title="Mount Erebus disaster">
<text>The Mount Erebus disaster occurred on 28 November 1979 when Air New Zealand Flight 901 (TE901) flew into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crew on board. Air New Zealand had been operating scheduled Antarctic sightseeing flights since 1977. This flight left Auckland Airport in the morning and was supposed to spend a few hours flying over the Antarctic continent, before returning to Auckland in the evening via Christchurch.

The initial investigation concluded the accident was caused primarily by pilot error, but public outcry led to the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the crash. The commission, presided over by Justice Peter Mahon, concluded that the accident was primarily caused by a correction made to the coordinates of the flight path the night before the disaster, coupled with a failure to inform the flight crew of the change, with the result that the aircraft, instead of being directed by computer down McMurdo Sound (as the crew had been led to believe), was instead rerouted to a path toward Mount Erebus. Justice Mahon&#x27;s report accused Air New Zealand of presenting &quot;an orchestrated litany of lies&quot;, and this led to changes in senior management at the airline. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council later ruled that the finding of a conspiracy was a breach of natural justice and not supported by the evidence.

The accident is the deadliest in the history of Air New Zealand, the deadliest aviation accident in Antarctica, and New Zealand&#x27;s deadliest peacetime disaster.
== Flight and aircraft ==
Flight 901 was designed and marketed as a unique sightseeing experience, carrying an experienced Antarctic guide, who pointed out scenic features and landmarks using the aircraft&#x27;s public-address system, while passengers enjoyed a low-flying sweep of McMurdo Sound. The flights left and returned to New Zealand the same day. The plane left Auckland International Airport at for Antarctica, and was scheduled to arrive back at Christchurch International Airport at after flying . The aircraft would make a 45-minute stop at Christchurch for refuelling and a crew change, before flying the remaining to Auckland, arriving at . Tickets for the November 1979 flights cost per person (equivalent to $ in ). Dignitaries including Sir Edmund Hillary had acted as guides on previous flights. Hillary was scheduled to act as the guide for the fatal flight of 28 November 1979, but had to cancel because of other commitments. His long-time friend and climbing companion, Peter Mulgrew, stood in as guide.

The aircraft used for Antarctic flights were Air New Zealand&#x27;s eight McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 trijets. The aircraft on 28 November was registered ZK-NZP.
The 182nd DC-10 to be built, and the fourth DC-10 to be introduced by Air New Zealand, ZK-NZP was handed over to the airline on 12 December 1974 at McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s Long Beach plant. It had logged more than 20,700 flight hours prior to the crash. Captain Thomas James &quot;Jim&quot; Collins (45) was an experienced pilot who had accumulated 11,151 flight hours, including 2,872 hours in the DC-10. First Officer Gregory Mark &quot;Greg&quot; Cassin (37) had accumulated 7,934 flight hours, including 1,361 in the DC-10. Flight Engineer Gordon Barrett Brooks (43) had 10,886 flight hours, including 3,000 in the DC-10 (Brooks had also been Flight Engineer on the Air New Zealand flight involved in the Cessna 188 Pacific rescue in 1978). Also on board were First Officer Graham Neville Lucas (39) and Flight Engineer Nicholas John &quot;Nick&quot; Moloney (44). Flight Engineer Moloney had a total of 6,468 flight hours, including 1,700 in the DC-10.

== Accident ==
=== Circumstances surrounding the accident ===
Captain Collins and co-pilot Cassin had never flown to Antarctica before (while flight engineer Brooks had flown to Antarctica only once previously), but they were experienced pilots and were considered qualified for the flight. On 9 November 1979, 19 days before departure, the two pilots attended a briefing in which they were given a copy of the previous flight&#x27;s flight plan.

The flight plan had been approved in 1977 by the Civil Aviation Division of the New Zealand Department of Transport and was along a track directly from Cape Hallett to the McMurdo non-directional beacon (NDB), which, coincidentally, entailed flying almost directly over the peak of Mount Erebus. Due to a typing error in the coordinates when the route was computerised, however, the printout from Air New Zealand&#x27;s ground computer system that was presented at the 9 November briefing corresponded to a southerly flight path down the middle of the wide McMurdo Sound, about to the west of Mount Erebus. The majority of the previous 13 flights had also entered this flight plan&#x27;s coordinates into their aircraft inertial navigational system and flown the McMurdo Sound route, unaware that the route flown did not correspond with the approved route.

Captain Leslie Simpson, the pilot of a flight on 14 November and also present at the 9 November briefing, compared the coordinates of the McMurdo tactical air navigation system (TACAN) navigation beacon (about east of McMurdo NDB), and the McMurdo waypoint that his flight crew had entered into the inertial navigation system (INS), and was surprised to find a large distance between the two. After his flight, Captain Simpson advised Air New Zealand&#x27;s navigation section of the difference in positions. For reasons that were disputed, this triggered Air New Zealand&#x27;s navigation section to update the McMurdo waypoint coordinates stored in the ground computer to correspond with the coordinates of the McMurdo TACAN beacon, despite this also not corresponding with the approved route.
The Air New Zealand navigation section changed the McMurdo waypoint co-ordinate stored in the ground computer system around on the morning of the flight from to . Crucially, the flight crew of Flight 901 was not notified of the change. The flight plan printout given to the crew on the morning of the flight, which was subsequently entered by them into the aircraft&#x27;s INS, differed from the flight plan presented at the 9 November briefing and from Captain Collins&#x27; map mark-ups, which he had prepared the night before the fatal flight. The key difference was that the flight plan presented at the briefing corresponded to a track down McMurdo Sound, giving Mount Erebus a wide berth to the east, whereas the flight plan printed on the morning of the flight corresponded to a track that coincided with Mount Erebus, which would result in a collision with Mount Erebus if this leg were flown at an altitude less than , 12,448 feet (3,794 m) being the top peak of Mount Erebus.

The Air New Zealand computer program was altered so that the standard telex forwarded to American air traffic controllers (ATCs) at the United States Antarctic science facility at McMurdo Station displayed the word &quot;McMurdo&quot;, rather than the coordinates of latitude and longitude, for the final waypoint. During the subsequent inquiry, Justice Mahon concluded that this was a deliberate attempt to conceal from the United States authorities that the flight plan had been changed, probably because it was known that US air traffic control (ATC) would lodge an objection to the new flight path.

The flight had earlier paused during the approach to McMurdo Sound to carry out a descent, via a figure-eight manoeuvre, through a gap in the low cloud base (later estimated to be at around ) while over water to establish visual contact with surface landmarks and give the passengers a better view. The flight crew either was unaware of or ignored the approved route&#x27;s minimum safe altitude (MSA) of for the approach to Mount Erebus, and in the sector south of Mount Erebus (and then only when the cloud base was at or better). Photographs and news stories from previous flights showed that many of these had been flown at levels substantially below the route&#x27;s MSA. In addition, preflight briefings for previous flights had approved descents to any altitude authorised by the US ATC at McMurdo Station. As the US ATC expected Flight 901 to follow the same route as previous flights down McMurdo Sound, and in accordance with the route waypoints previously advised by Air New Zealand to them, the US ATC advised Flight 901 that it had a radar that could let them down to . The radar equipment did not pick up the aircraft, however, and the crew also experienced difficulty establishing VHF communications. The distance measuring equipment did not lock onto the McMurdo TACAN for any useful period.

Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcripts from the last minutes of the flight before impact with Mount Erebus indicated that the flight crew believed they were flying over McMurdo Sound, well to the west of Mount Erebus and with the Ross Ice Shelf visible on the horizon, when in reality they were flying directly toward the mountain. Despite most of the crew being engaged in identifying visual landmarks at the time, they never perceived the mountain directly in front of them. About 6 minutes after completing a descent in visual meteorological conditions, Flight 901 collided with the mountain at an altitude around , on the lower slopes of the 12,448-ft-tall (3,794 m) mountain. Passenger photographs taken seconds before the collision removed all plausibility of a &quot;flying in cloud&quot; theory, showing perfectly clear visibility well beneath the cloud base, with landmarks to the left and to the right of the aircraft visible.

=== Changes to the coordinates and departure ===
The crew put the coordinates into the plane&#x27;s computer before they departed at from Auckland International Airport. Unknown to them, the coordinates had been modified earlier that morning to correct the error introduced previously and undetected until then.
The crew evidently did not check the destination waypoint against a topographical map (as did Captain Simpson on the flight of 14 November) or they would have noticed the change. Charts for the Antarctic were not available to the pilot for planning purposes, being withheld until the flight was about to depart. The charts eventually provided, which were carried on the aircraft, were neither comprehensive enough nor large enough in scale to support detailed plotting. These new coordinates changed the flight plan to track east of their understanding. The coordinates programmed the plane to overfly Mount Erebus, a volcano, instead of down McMurdo Sound.

About four hours after a smooth take-off, the flight was away from McMurdo Station. The radio communications centre there allowed the pilots to descend to and to continue &quot;visually&quot;. Air-safety regulations at the time did not allow flights to descend to lower than , even in good weather, although Air New Zealand&#x27;s own travel magazine showed photographs of previous flights clearly operating below . Collins believed the plane was over open water.

=== Crash into Mount Erebus ===
Collins told McMurdo Station that he would be dropping to , at which point he switched control of the aircraft to the autopilot. Outside, a layer of clouds blended with the white snow-covered volcano, forming a sector whiteout – no contrast between ground and sky was visible to the pilots. The effect deceived everyone on the flight deck, making them believe that the white mountainside was the Ross Ice Shelf, a huge expanse of floating ice derived from the great ice sheets of Antarctica, which was in fact now behind the mountain. As it was little understood, even by experienced polar pilots, Air New Zealand had provided no training for the flight crew on the sector whiteout phenomenon. Consequently, the crew thought they were flying along McMurdo Sound, when they were actually flying over Lewis Bay in front of Mount Erebus.

At 12:49 pm, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) began sounding a series of &quot;whoop, whoop, pull up&quot; alarms, warning that the plane was dangerously close to terrain. The CVR recorded the following:

: GPWS: &quot;Whoop whoop. Pull up. Whoop whoop...&quot;
: F/E: &quot;Five hundred feet.&quot;
: GPWS: &quot;...Pull up.&quot;
: F/E: &quot;Four hundred feet.&quot;
: GPWS: &quot;Whoop, whoop. Pull up. Whoop whoop. Pull up.&quot;
: CA: &quot;Go-around power please.&quot;
: GPWS: &quot;Whoop, whoop. Pull-&quot;
: CAM: [Sound of impact]
: End of recording.

The pilots had begun a terrain escape manoeuvre by applying full (go-around) power, but it was too late. Six seconds later, the plane crashed into the side of Mount Erebus and exploded, instantly killing everyone on board. The accident occurred at 12:50 pm at a position of and an elevation of above mean sea level. McMurdo Station attempted to contact the flight after the crash, and informed Air New Zealand headquarters in Auckland that communication with the aircraft had been lost. United States search-and-rescue personnel were placed on standby.

===Nationalities of passengers and crew===
Air New Zealand had not lost any passengers to an accident or incident until this event took place. The nationalities of the passengers and crew included:
==Rescue and recovery==

=== Initial search and discovery ===
At 2:00 pm, the United States Navy released a situation report stating:

:Air New Zealand Flight 901 has failed to acknowledge radio transmissions. ... One LC-130 fixed-wing aircraft and two UH-1N rotary-wing aircraft are preparing to launch for SAR effort.&quot;

Data gathered at 3:43 pm were added to the situation report, stating that the visibility was . Also, six aircraft had been launched to find the flight.

Flight 901 was due to arrive back at Christchurch at 6:05 pm for a stopover including refuelling and a crew change before completing the journey back to Auckland. Around 50 passengers were also supposed to disembark at Christchurch. Airport staff initially told the waiting families that the flight being slightly late was not unusual, but as time went on, it became clear that something was wrong.

At 9:00 pm, about half an hour after the plane would have run out of fuel, Air New Zealand informed the press that it believed the aircraft to be lost. Rescue teams searched along the assumed flight path, but found nothing. At 12:55 am, the crew of a United States Navy aircraft discovered unidentified debris along the side of Mount Erebus. No survivors could be seen. Around 9:00 am, 20 hours after the crash, helicopters with search parties managed to land on the side of the mountain. They confirmed that the wreckage was that of Flight 901 and that all 237 passengers and 20 crew members had been killed. The DC-10&#x27;s altitude at the time of the collision was .

The vertical stabiliser section of the plane, with the koru logo clearly visible, was found in the snow. Bodies and fragments of the aircraft were flown back to Auckland for identification. The remains of 44 of the victims were not individually identified. A funeral was held for them on 22 February 1980.

===Operation Overdue===

The recovery effort of Flight 901 was called &quot;Operation Overdue.&quot;

Efforts for recovery were extensive, owing in part to the pressure from Japan, as 24 passengers had been Japanese. The operation lasted until 9 December 1979, with up to 60 recovery workers on site at a time.
A team of New Zealand Police officers and a mountain-face rescue team were dispatched on a No. 40 Squadron C-130 Hercules aircraft.

The job of individual identification took many weeks, and was largely done by teams of pathologists, dentists, and police. The mortuary team was led by Inspector Jim Morgan, who collated and edited a report on the recovery operation. Recordkeeping had to be meticulous because of the number and fragmented state of the human remains that had to be identified to the satisfaction of the coroner. The exercise resulted in 83% of the deceased passengers and crew eventually being identified, sometimes from evidence such as a finger capable of yielding a print, or keys in a pocket.

In 2006, the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus) was instituted to recognise the service of New Zealanders, and citizens of the United States of America and other countries, who were involved in the body recovery, identification, and crash investigation phases of Operation Overdue. On 5 June 2009, the New Zealand government recognised some of the Americans who assisted in Operation Overdue during a ceremony in Washington, DC. A total of 40 Americans, mostly Navy personnel, are eligible to receive the medal.

== Inquiries ==

Despite Flight 901 crashing in one of the most isolated parts of the world, evidence from the crash site was extensive. Both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder were in working order and able to be deciphered. Extensive photographic footage, including video, from the moments before the crash was available; being a sightseeing flight, most passengers were carrying cameras, from which the majority of the film could be developed.

=== Official accident report ===
The accident report compiled by New Zealand&#x27;s chief inspector of air accidents, Ron Chippindale, was released on 12 June 1980. It cited pilot error as the principal cause of the accident and attributed blame to the decision of Collins to descend below the customary minimum altitude level, and to continue at that altitude when the crew was unsure of the plane&#x27;s position. The customary minimum altitude prohibited descent below even under good weather conditions, but a combination of factors led the captain to believe the plane was over the sea (the middle of McMurdo Sound and few small low islands), and previous Flight 901 pilots had regularly flown low over the area to give passengers a better view, as evidenced by photographs in Air New Zealand&#x27;s own travel magazine and by first-hand accounts of personnel based on the ground at NZ&#x27;s Scott Base.

=== Mahon inquiry ===
In response to public demand, the New Zealand government announced a further one-man Royal Commission of Inquiry into the accident, to be performed by Justice Peter Mahon. This Royal Commission was initially handicapped in that the deadline was extremely short; originally set for 31 October 1980, it was subsequently extended four times. The report was released on 27 April 1981, and cleared the crew of blame. Mahon concluded that the single, dominant and effective cause of the crash was Air New Zealand&#x27;s alteration of the flight plan waypoint coordinates in the ground navigation computer without advising the crew. The new flight plan took the aircraft directly over the mountain, rather than along its flank. Due to whiteout conditions, &quot;a malevolent trick of the polar light&quot;, the crew were unable to visually identify the mountain in front of them. Furthermore, they may have experienced a rare meteorological phenomenon called sector whiteout, which creates the visual illusion of a flat horizon far in the distance. A very broad gap between cloud layers appeared to allow a view of the distant Ross Ice Shelf and beyond. Mahon noted that the flight crew, with many thousands of hours of flight time between them, had considerable experience with the extreme accuracy of the aircraft&#x27;s inertial navigation system. Mahon also found that the preflight briefings for previous flights had approved descents to any altitude authorised by the US ATC at McMurdo Station, and that the radio communications centre at McMurdo Station had indeed authorised Collins to descend to , below the minimum safe level of .

In his report, Mahon found that airline executives and senior pilots had engaged in a conspiracy to whitewash the inquiry, accusing them of &quot;an orchestrated litany of lies&quot; by covering up evidence and lying to investigators. Mahon found that, in the original report, Chippindale had a poor grasp of the flying involved in jet-airline operation, as he (and the New Zealand CAA in general) was typically involved in investigating simple light aircraft crashes. Chippindale&#x27;s investigation techniques were revealed as lacking in rigour, which allowed errors and avoidable gaps in knowledge to appear in reports. Consequently, Chippindale entirely missed the importance of the flight-plan change and the rare meteorological conditions of Antarctica. Had the pilots been informed of the flight plan change, the crash would have been avoided.

==Court proceedings==

=== Judicial review ===
On 20 May 1981, Air New Zealand applied to the High Court of New Zealand for judicial review of Mahon&#x27;s order that it pay more than half the costs of the Mahon inquiry, and for judicial review of some of the findings of fact Mahon had made in his report. The application was referred to the Court of Appeal, which unanimously set aside the costs order. The Court of Appeal, by majority, though, declined to go any further, and in particular, declined to set aside Mahon&#x27;s finding that members of the management of Air New Zealand had conspired to commit perjury before the inquiry to cover up the errors of the ground staff.

=== Appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ===
Mahon then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London against the Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision. His findings as to the cause of the accident, namely reprogramming of the aircraft&#x27;s flight plan by the ground crew, who then failed to inform the flight crew, had not been challenged before the Court of Appeal, so were not challenged before the Privy Council. His conclusion that the crash was the result of the aircrew being misdirected as to their flight path, not due to pilot error, therefore remained.

Regarding the issue of Air New Zealand stating a minimum altitude of 6,000 feet for pilots in the vicinity of McMurdo Base, the Judicial Committee stated, 
However, the Law Lords of the Judicial Committee under the chair of Lord Diplock effectively agreed with some of the views of the minority in the Court of Appeal in concluding that Mahon had acted in breach of natural justice by finding that Air New Zealand management had been engaged in a conspiracy, an accusation which they determined was not supported by the evidence. In its judgment, delivered on 20 October 1983, the Judicial Committee therefore dismissed Mahon&#x27;s appeal. Aviation researcher John King wrote in his book &quot;New Zealand Tragedies, Aviation&quot;:

&quot;Exhibit 164&quot; was a photocopied diagram of McMurdo Sound showing a southbound flight path passing west of Ross Island and a northbound path passing the island on the east. The diagram did not extend sufficiently far south to show where, how, or even if they joined, and left the two paths disconnected. Evidence had been given to the effect that the diagram had been included in the flight crew&#x27;s briefing documentation.

== Legacy of the disaster ==
The crash of Flight 901 is one of New Zealand&#x27;s three deadliest disasters – the others being the 1874 &quot;Cospatrick&quot; sailing ship disaster in which 470 people died, and the 1931 Hawke&#x27;s Bay earthquake, which killed 256 people. At the time of the disaster, it was the -deadliest air crash of all time. , the crash remains Air New Zealand&#x27;s deadliest accident, as well as New Zealand&#x27;s deadliest peacetime disaster (excluding the &quot;Cospatrick&quot; sailing ship disaster, which happened south of the Cape of Good Hope, en route to Auckland).

Flight 901, in conjunction with the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 in Chicago six months earlier (25 May), severely hurt the reputation of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Following the Chicago crash, the FAA withdrew the DC-10&#x27;s type certificate on 6 June, which grounded all U.S.-registered DC-10s and forbade any foreign government that had a bilateral agreement with the United States regarding aircraft certifications from flying their DC-10s, which included Air New Zealand&#x27;s seven DC-10s. The Air New Zealand DC-10 fleet was grounded until the FAA measures were rescinded five weeks later, on 13 July, after all carriers had completed modifications that responded to issues discovered from the American Airlines Flight 191 incident.

Flight 901 was the third-deadliest accident involving a DC-10, following Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and American Airlines Flight 191. The event marked the beginning of the end for Air New Zealand&#x27;s DC-10 fleet, although talk existed before the accident of replacing the aircraft; DC-10s were replaced by Boeing 747s from mid-1981, and the last Air New Zealand DC-10 flew in December 1982. The occurrence also spelled the end of commercially operated Antarctic sightseeing flights – Air New Zealand cancelled all its Antarctic flights after Flight 901, and Qantas suspended its Antarctic flights in February 1980, only returning on a limited basis again in 1994.

Almost all of the aircraft&#x27;s wreckage still lies where it came to rest on the slopes of Mount Erebus, as both its remote location and its weather conditions can hamper any further recovery operations. During the cold periods, the wreckage is buried under a layer of snow and ice. During warm periods, when snow recedes, it is visible from the air.

Following the incident, all charter flights to Antarctica from New Zealand ceased, and were not resumed until 2013, when a Boeing 747-400 chartered from Qantas set off from Auckland for a sightseeing flight over the continent.

Justice Mahon&#x27;s report was finally tabled in Parliament by the then-Minister of Transport, Maurice Williamson, in 1999.

In the New Zealand Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list in June 2007, Captain Gordon Vette was awarded the ONZM (Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit), recognising his services in assisting Justice Mahon during the Erebus inquiry. Vette&#x27;s book, &quot;Impact Erebus&quot;, provides a commentary of the flight, its crash, and the subsequent investigations.

In 2008, Justice Mahon was posthumously awarded the Jim Collins Memorial Award by the New Zealand Airline Pilots Association for exceptional contributions to air safety, &quot;in forever changing the general approach used in transport accidents investigations world wide.&quot;

In 2009, Air New Zealand&#x27;s CEO Rob Fyfe apologised to all those affected who did not receive appropriate support and compassion from the company following the incident, and unveiled a commemorative sculpture at its headquarters.

On 28 November 2019, the 40th anniversary of the disaster, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, along with the national government, issued a formal apology to the families of the victims. Ardern &quot;[expressed] regret on behalf of Air New Zealand for the accident&quot;, and &quot;[apologised] on behalf of the airline which 40 years ago failed in its duty of care to its passengers and staff.&quot;

The registration of the crashed aircraft, ZK-NZP, has not been reissued.

==Memorials==

A wooden cross was erected on the mountain above Scott Base to commemorate the accident. It was replaced in 1986 with an aluminium cross after the original was eroded by low temperatures, wind, and moisture.

The memorial for the 16 passengers who were unidentifiable and the 28 whose bodies were never found is at Waikumete Cemetery in Glen Eden, Auckland. It was dedicated on the first anniversary of the tragedy, in November 1980. Beside the memorial is a Japanese cherry tree, planted as a memorial to the 24 Japanese passengers who died on board Flight 901.

A memorial to the crew members of Flight 901 is located adjacent to Auckland Airport, on Tom Pearce Drive at the eastern end of the airport zone.

On 4 December 1979, 6 days after the crash, St Matthews in the City Church held a Memorial Service for the victims of the accident. Just before the 10 year Anniversary, a memorial stained glass window was installed in the church and dedicated to the 257 people who lost their lives.

To mark the 25th anniversary of the Erebus disaster, a wreath-laying ceremony and memorial service was held on Antarctica in 2004.

In January 2010, a sculpted koru containing letters written by the loved ones of those who died was placed next to the Antarctic cross. It was originally to have been placed at the site by six relatives of the victims on the 30th anniversary of the crash, 28 November 2009, but this was delayed for two months due to bad weather. It was planned for a second koru capsule, mirroring the first capsule, to be placed at Scott Base in 2011.

The book-length poem &quot;Erebus&quot; by American writer Jane Summer (Sibling Rivalry Press, 2015) memorialises a close friend who died in the tragedy, and in a feat of &#x27;investigative poetry&#x27;, explores the chain of flawed decisions that caused the crash.

In 2019, it was announced that a national memorial is to be installed in Parnell Rose Gardens, with a relative of one of the crash victims stating that it was the right place. However, local residents criticised the memorial&#x27;s location, saying that it would &quot;destroy the ambiance of the park&quot;. After numerous delays, construction was set to begin in October 2021. However, due to an investigation by the Ombudsman, construction was limited to reversible &quot;preparation works&quot;. The delays were caused by protests against the construction, fearing that it could endanger the giant pōhutukawa in the park.

In March 2022, the Ombudsman released his report, stating that Ministry of Culture &amp; Heritage &quot;should have consulted more widely before forming its preference for a location,&quot; and that it &quot;acted unreasonably in October 2019, when it failed to reply to correspondence about resource consent for the proposed memorial.&quot; Construction was halted upon the recommendation given, which &quot;called for the ministry to resolve any grievances before construction begins.&quot; By 10 February 2023, the Ombudsman was satisfied by the actions taken to implement his recommendations.

However, the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods and Cyclone Gabrielle led to &quot;significant land slips occurring along the cliff line,&quot; including one in the vicinity of the memorial site. The geotechnical engineering assessment undertaken concluded that &quot;the land was unsafe to build the memorial on&quot;, forcing them to abandon the plans to build the memorial in Parnell Rose Gardens, and to find a new memorial site.

==In popular culture==
The crash coincided with the Air New Zealand Shell Open, a golf tournament sponsored by Air New Zealand. CEO Morrie Davis was playing the pro-am when he first heard word that the plane was &quot;lost.&quot; Air New Zealand thought about cancelling the tournament but decided against it.

A television miniseries, &quot;&quot;, focusing on the investigation and the Royal Commission of Inquiry, was broadcast in New Zealand and Australia in 1988.

The phrase &quot;an orchestrated litany of lies&quot; entered New Zealand popular culture for some years.

In 2014, a feature-length docudrama, &quot;Operation Overdue,&quot; on the disaster was produced for TVNZ, focusing on the namesake recovery mission and 11 police officers who helped recover victims&#x27; bodies. In 2019, two in-depth podcast series were produced on the 40th anniversary of the disaster by RNZ and the NZ Herald.

The disaster features in the fifth episode of season two of The Weather Channel documentary series &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;. The episode is titled &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;, and was first aired in January 2015.

== Official records ==

<doc id="1158007" wikidata="Q196495" url="?curid=1158007" title="Amundsen Glacier">
<text>The Amundsen Glacier () is a major Antarctic glacier, about 7 to 11 km (4 to 6 nmi) wide and 150 km (80 nmi) long. It originates on the Antarctic Plateau where it drains the area to the south and west of Nilsen Plateau, then descends through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf just west of the MacDonald Nunataks.

==Name==
The Amundsen Glacier was discovered by Richard E. Byrd on the South Pole flight in November 1929.
The name was proposed for Roald Amundsen by Laurence Gould, leader of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (Byrd AE) geological party which sledged past the mouth of the glacier in December 1929.

==Location==
According to &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1960), &quot;Lying eastward of the Bowman Glacier is the Amundsen Glacier, the northern portal of which is in 85°30&#x27; S., 159°00&#x27; W. It is about 6 miles wide and trends southward about 60 miles to the polar plateau. Mount Helmer Hanssen, about 10,742 feet high, is a rounded dome, completely snow-covered, standing conspicuously above the westem wall. A tributary glacier, about 5 miles wide, enters the Amundsen Glacier on the northern side of the Mount Helmer Hanssen massif. The Amundsen Glacier has not been traversed. &quot;

The Amundsen Glacier rises on the polar plateau to the west of the Rawson Mountains.
It flows northwest to the Nødtvedt Nunataks, which it passes on both sides, and is fed by the Norway Glacier from the left (west) south of Mount Hassel, where it wheels to the north and then northeast, fed by Devils Glacier from the left, by the Epler Glacier from the right and then by the Christy Glacier from the left.
The tributary Blackwall Glacier flows northwest along the northeast side of Hansen Spur to join Amundsen Glacier.
It flows north through past Beck Peak and the Breyer Mesa.
Continuing north it is joined by the Tate Glacier, Moffett Glacier and Whitney Glacier from the left, and by the Cappellari Glacier to the right.
As it enters the Ross Ice Shelf between Witalis Peak and the MacDonald Nunataks it converges with the Bowman Glacier on the left and the Goodale Glacier on the right.
==Left tributaries==


Left (west) tributaries from south to north are:

===Norway Glacier=== 

A tributary glacier about long, descending the polar plateau just west of Mount Prestrud, and flowing northeast to enter Amundsen Glacier between Mount Bjaaland and Mount Hassel. Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in association with the many features named in this area for members of Amundsen&#x27;s Norwegian expedition of 1910-12.

===Devils Glacier===
A heavily crevassed glacier at the edge of the polar plateau, about long and wide, draining the south part of the Mohn Basin and flowing northeast to enter the upper part of Amundsen Glacier just north of the mountain group consisting of Mount Wisting, Mount Hassel, Mount Bjaaland and Mount Prestrud. 
The glacier was encountered by Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole Party in 1911 and was named by them to describe the extremely rough sledging in the area. 
Amundsen&#x27;s route southward, between 168° and 169°W, took the party across the upper or western portion of the glacier.

===Christy Glacier=== 
A steep tributary glacier draining southeast along the southwest side of Breyer Mesa to enter Amundsen Glacier.
Mapped by United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64.
Named by US-ACAN for Clarence C. Christy, maintenance shop supervisor at Williams Field, McMurdo Sound, on USN OpDFrz 1967.

===Tate Glacier===
A tributary glacier on the south side of Thomas Spur, flowing east and merging with Moffett Glacier just east of the spur where the two glaciers enter the larger Amundsen Glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and USN air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for Robert Tate, geomagnetist / seismologist with the South Pole Station winter party, 1964.

===Moffett Glacier=== 
A tributary glacier, long, flowing east from Rawson Plateau to enter Amundsen Glacier just south of Mount Benjamin. 
Discovered by R. Admiral Byrd on the South Pole flight of Nov. 28-29, 1929, and named by him for R. Admiral William A. Moffett, USN, first Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Dept. of the Navy.

===Whitney Glacier=== 
A tributary glacier, long, draining northeast from Mount Ellsworth to enter Amundsen Glacier just south of Robinson Bluff. 
Discovered and mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928-30. 
Named by US-ACAN for Raymond L. Whitney, meteorologist, South Pole Station winter party, 1961.

===Bowman Glacier=== 
A deeply entrenched glacier, long, descending the polar plateau between Quarles Range and Rawson Plateau of the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf just west of the flow of Amundsen Glacier. 
Discovered in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould, and named by Byrd for Isaiah Bowman, eminent geographer and president of Johns Hopkins University, 1935-49; Director of the American Geographical Society, 1915–35.

===Steagall Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, draining the east slopes of Rawson Plateau between Mount Alice Gade and Mount Deardorff and flowing north to enter Bowman Glacier. 
First mapped by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1928–30. 
Named by US-ACAN for Jack Steagall, meteorologist, South Pole Station winter party, 1961.

==Right tributaries==
Right (east) tributaries from south to north are:
===Epler Glacier=== 
A tributary glacier, long, draining west from Nilsen Plateau to enter Amundsen Glacier just south of Olsen Crags. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and USN air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for Charles F. Epler, storekeeper with USN Squadron VX-6 on Operation Deep Freeze 1966 and 1967.

===Blackwall Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, which drains a portion of the west slope of Nilsen Plateau. It flows northwest along the northeast side of Hansen Spur to join Amundsen Glacier. 
The name was used by both the 1963-64 and 1970-71 Ohio State University field parties at Nilsen Plateau; all the rock walls surrounding this glacier are black in appearance.

===Cappellari Glacier=== 
A glacier long in the Hays Mountains, flowing west from the northwest shoulder of Mount Vaughan to enter Amundsen Glacier just north of Mount Dort. 
First roughly mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928-30.
Remapped by USGS from ground surveys and USN air photos, 1960-64. Named by US-ACAN for Lewis K. Cappellari who made ionospheric studies at McMurdo Station in 1965.

===Goodale Glacier===
A glacier which flows north from Mount Goodale and Mount Armstrong along the west side of Medina Peaks, in the foothills of the Queen Maud Mountains. 
First seen and mapped by the ByrdAE, 1928-30. Named by US-ACAN in association with Mount Goodale.

==Head of glacier==
A mountain group consisting of Mount Wisting, Mount Hassel, Mount Bjaaland and Mount Prestrud lies at the head of the Amundsen Glacier just south of the point where the Devils Glacier enters from the left.
In November 1911, a number of mountain peaks in this general vicinity were observed and rudely positioned by the South Pole Party under Roald Amundsen. 
He named peaks in the massif for members of his South Pole Party.
The peaks were mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photography in 1960–64. 
For the sake of historical continuity and to commemorate the Norwegian exploration in this area, the US-ACAN assigned Amundsen&#x27;s chosen names to the peaks.

===Mount Wisting=== 
A rock peak (2,580 m), the north westernmost summit of the massif. 
Amundsen named one of the peaks for Oscar Wisting, a member of the party. 
The US-ACAN has selected this feature to be designated Mount Wisting.

===Mount Hassel===
A rock peak high, the northeasternmost summit of the massif.
Amundsen named one of the peaks for Sverre Hassel, a member of the party.
The US-ACAN has selected this feature to be designated Mount Hassel..

===Mount Bjaaland===
A rock peak high, the southeasternmost summit of the massif.
Amundsen named one of the peaks for Olaf Bjaaland, a member of the party. 
The US-ACAN has selected this feature to be designated Mount Bjaaland.

===Mount Prestrud===
A peak over high which rises from the southwestern part of the massif. 
Amundsen named one of the peaks for Lieutenant Kristian Prestrud, first officer of the Fram and leader of the Norwegian expedition&#x27;s Eastern Sledge Party to the Scott Nunataks. 
The US-ACAN has selected this feature to be designated Mount Prestrud.

<doc id="1158017" wikidata="Q171442" url="?curid=1158017" title="Derek Warwick">
<text>Derek Stanley Arthur Warwick (born 27 August 1954) is a British former professional racing driver from England, who lives in Jersey. He raced for many years in Formula One, collecting four podiums but never winning a Grand Prix. He did, however, win the 1992 24 Hours of Le Mans and 1992 World Sportscar Championship. He was the elder brother of Paul Warwick, who died racing while leading the British Formula 3000 Championship in 1991.

In 2005 and 2006 he raced in the inaugural season of the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired Formula One drivers. He has served as the fourth steward for three Grands Prix in 2010 and 2011. He was president of the British Racing Drivers Club (2011-2017), succeeding Damon Hill and preceding Paddy Hopkirk.

==Early life and career==

Warwick was born in Alresford, Hampshire, England. He began his career in British stock car racing under the Spedeworth organisation at tracks such as his local Aldershot Stadium. He won the Superstox English Championship in 1971 (at the age of 16) and the World Championship at Wimbledon Stadium in 1973. His younger brother Paul also raced with some success in Superstox before progressing to Formula 3000, in which he was racing when killed in an accident in 1991.

Derek finished runner-up in the 1978 British Formula 3 Championship.

==Formula One (1981–1993)==

Warwick began his Formula One career with the fledgling F1 team Toleman for the 1981 season. He managed to qualify for only one race that year, the season finale at Las Vegas. Warwick had mainly dismal 1982 and 1983 seasons in the Toleman car, but bounced back, scoring points in the final four rounds of the 1983 championship.

He joined Renault in 1984 after Alain Prost left them at the end of 1983. Warwick, expecting to have a race-winning car, led the Brazilian Grand Prix, his first drive for them, only to retire because of a suspension failure caused by an early race wheel banging duel with the McLaren of Niki Lauda. He finished in second place in both the Belgian and British Grands Prix in and placed seventh in the championship. 1984 would prove to be the beginning of the end for the factory Renault team, the pioneers of turbocharging in Formula One. Neither Warwick nor new teammate Patrick Tambay won a race in 1984, the first time since that the team did not win a Grand Prix.

The turning point in Warwick&#x27;s career was his decision to stay at Renault for and reject an offer to drive for Williams-Honda. The seat was then offered to Nigel Mansell who, accepting the position, went on to win two races at the end of the season. 1985 was a poor one for Renault and the team withdrew from Formula One at the end of the year. Renault&#x27;s withdrawal, and Ayrton Senna&#x27;s refusal to let Warwick join him as teammate at Lotus (using his contracted number one driver status in the team, Senna refused to have anyone but a pure #2 as his teammate as he believed Lotus were not capable of supporting two championship contending drivers), left Warwick without a team for the season and he took up an offer to drive for Tom Walkinshaw&#x27;s TWR Jaguar team in the World Sportscar Championship. Following the death of Elio de Angelis in a testing accident in May, however, Warwick was invited to take his place at Brabham. Unconfirmed rumours surfaced that Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone had invited Warwick to take de Angelis&#x27;s place as the Englishman was the only available top driver who had not actually contacted the team offering his services in the days following the Italian&#x27;s untimely death. Warwick explained:

&quot;I got a phone call from Bernie, who said that he really appreciated the fact that I didn&#x27;t call him five minutes after Elio had died and would I like to drive for him.&quot;

As no Grands Prix clashed with his Sportscar commitments, Warwick was able to race in both world championships.

In 1987, Warwick moved to the Arrows team alongside his Jaguar teammate Eddie Cheever, ending the season with 3 points scored. The 1988 season saw an improvement on the Arrows performance due to the powerful Megatron (a re-badged BMW M12) engine and Warwick finished 7 times in the top 6, earning him 17 points and a respectable 8th position in the championship. His best race of the season was 4th in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where he finished only half a second behind Cheever. Italy was also notable in that it was the first time since the beginning of 1987 that Arrows engine guru Heini Mader finally solved the problem with the FIA&#x27;s mandatory pop-off valve which restricted turbo boost. For the first time this allowed both Warwick and Cheever to fully exploit the power of the Megatron engine (restricted to 2.5 BAR boost in 1988) and be much closer to the front than they had been previously.

In 1989, victory eluded Warwick in two occasions. The first was in the Brazilian Grand Prix, when a disastrous pit-stop cost him more than the 17 seconds he finished behind winner Nigel Mansell. But the real heartbreak came in the Canadian Grand Prix, when Warwick drove superbly and was leading the wet race, only to have his Cosworth engine fail on lap 40 while in second place. Ayrton Senna, who had passed Warwick for the lead on lap 38, would himself retire when his McLaren&#x27;s Honda V10 blew 3 laps from the finish. As Warwick was lapping much quicker than those behind him, including the V10 Williams-Renault of eventual winner Thierry Boutsen, it is possible he could have scored his first Grand Prix win had he finished. Reliability issues plagued Warwick&#x27;s season and cost him good finishes in other races as well, resulting in only 7 points for the season, the last of his 3 years at Arrows.

For the 1990 season, 4 years after Senna&#x27;s veto, Warwick finally drove for Lotus who in 1990 would be using the Lamborghini V12 engine. But the glory days of that team were over and the Lamborghini 3512 proved both underpowered and unreliable and Warwick ended the season with a meagre 3 points tally. Warwick would later describe the Lamborghini as &quot;All noise and no go&quot; while also noting that the Lotus 102 was not a pleasant car to drive as its chassis would &quot;flex&quot;, not just under power but also under breaking. His greatest achievement of the season happened at the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix where his teammate Martin Donnelly suffered a severe crash leaving Warwick to help morale at the team by qualifying in the top 10 only for the gearbox to fail 10 laps from the end. Warwick himself had a somewhat terrifying crash at the Italian GP at Monza when on the last turn on the first lap at the Parabolica, the Lotus drifted wide to the left and off the track, collecting the barrier at speed before flipping over onto its side and roll cover while sliding down front straight with cars speeding past. Thankfully no other cars hit the stricken Lotus and an unhurt Warwick was able to scramble from his upturned car and actually run back to the pits to get into the spare car for the re-start (the race had been red flagged with the Lotus stuck in the middle of the track). To his credit, Warwick readily admitted to nothing more than driver error, just running too wide at the exit of the turn.

In 1992 Warwick tested an IndyCar Lola T92/00 for Hall/VDS Racing for 2 days at Mid-Ohio in the off-season, to assess a possible move to CART for 1993. Ultimately he did not and instead returned to Formula 1.

Warwick had firm offers of paid drives for 1993 with Jordan and Footwork and ultimately chose the latter. Warwick returned to Formula 1 following a 3-year sabbatical and completed the full season in 1993, but managed to score only 4 points. He ended his career with a total of 71 Grand Prix points.

Some consider Warwick to be the best Formula One driver never to win a Grand Prix.

==Sports and Touring cars==

Warwick also competed successfully in sports car racing, winning the World Sportscar Championship in 1992, and was part of the Peugeot team which was victorious at the 24 hours of Le Mans race that year. He drove sports cars for Jaguar in 1986 and 1991.

Warwick raced in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) after retiring from Formula One, driving for the Alfa Romeo works team in 1995. Despite the team&#x27;s dominating the previous year, their car was underdeveloped this time, leading to a poor season. In the first race of the season at Donington Park he crashed and flying debris broke a TV camera lens, an incident featured in the highlights screened by the BBC a week later, with commentator Murray Walker quipping that Warwick owed them £6,000 for the damage (&quot;that&#x27;ll be six grand please, Derek!&quot;).
 After a year out of racing, he co-founded the Triple Eight Racing team with Roland Dane and took over the running of the works Vauxhall 1997 BTCC entry, as well as owning three car dealerships in Southampton and Jersey. Originally set to be team principal, it was decided he would drive one of the cars alongside established Vauxhall driver John Cleland, winning a wet race at Knockhill in 1998. He retired from racing at the end of the year, but continued his involvement in the team for another 3 years.

Warwick now operates a Honda franchise in Jersey.

==Later life==

Warwick deputised for Martin Brundle (who was racing at Le Mans) as Murray Walker&#x27;s co-commentator on ITV for the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix. In 2005 and 2006, Warwick raced in the inaugural season of the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired Formula One drivers. In 2010, he served as the fourth steward for the Spanish and Hungarian Grands Prix. In 2011, Warwick served as the fourth steward for the 2011 Turkish Grand Prix. This role is given only to former racing drivers who advise the stewards panel on incidents from a driver perspective. He was president of the British Racing Drivers Club, after succeeding Damon Hill. Paddy Hopkirk replaced him as president of the BRDC in 2016. 
In 2015, Warwick received treatment for bowel cancer.

<text>Zoar is an unincorporated community in northern Hamilton Township, Warren County, Ohio, United States. It is located on the 3C Highway about one mile east of Hopkinsville and three miles west of Morrow in Virginia Military District Military Survey 1546.

A large share of the first settlers of Zoar were Germans. By the 1840s, Zoar was a local commercial center. With the construction of the railroad, business activity shifted away from inland Zoar, and the town&#x27;s population dwindled.

<text>Acharya Pingala (; c. 3rd2nd century BCE) was an ancient Indian poet and mathematician, and the author of the &quot;&quot; (), also called the &quot;Pingala-sutras&quot; (), the earliest known treatise on Sanskrit prosody.

The &#x27; is a work of eight chapters in the late [[Sūtra]] style, not fully comprehensible without a commentary. It has been dated to the last few centuries BCE. In the 10th century CE, [[Halayudha]] wrote a commentary elaborating on the&#x27;. According to some historians Maharshi Pingala was the brother of Pāṇini, the famous Sanskrit grammarian, considered the first descriptive linguist&quot;.&quot; Another think tank identifies him as Patanjali, the 2nd century CE scholar who authored Mahabhashya.

==Combinatorics==
The &quot;&quot; presents a formula to generate systematic enumerations of metres, of all possible combinations of light (&quot;laghu&quot;) and heavy (&quot;guru&quot;) syllables, for a word of &quot;n&quot; syllables, using a recursive formula, that results in a partially ordered binary representation. Pingala is credited with being the first to express the combinatorics of Sanskrit metre, eg.
* Create a syllable list &quot;x&quot; comprising one light (&quot;L&quot;) and heavy (&quot;G&quot;) syllable:
* Repeat till list &quot;x&quot; contains only words of the desired length &quot;n&quot;
** Replicate list &quot;x&quot; as lists &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;
*** Append syllable &quot;L&quot; to each element of list &quot;a&quot;
*** Append syllable &quot;G&quot; to each element of list &quot;b&quot;
** Append lists &quot;b&quot; to list &quot;a&quot; and rename as list &quot;x&quot;

Because of this, Pingala is sometimes also credited with the first use of zero, as he used the Sanskrit word &quot;śūnya&quot; to explicitly refer to the number. Pingala&#x27;s binary representation increases towards the right, and not to the left as modern binary numbers usually do. In Pingala&#x27;s system, the numbers start from number one, and not zero. Four short syllables &quot;0000&quot; is the first pattern and corresponds to the value one. The numerical value is obtained by adding one to the sum of place values. Pingala&#x27;s work also includes material related to the Fibonacci numbers, called &quot;&quot;.

<text>The FV510 Warrior tracked vehicle family is a series of British armoured vehicles, originally developed to replace FV430 series armoured vehicles. The Warrior started life as the MCV-80, &quot;Mechanised Combat Vehicle for the 1980s&quot;. One of the requirements of the new vehicle was a top speed able to keep up with the projected new MBT, the MBT-80 later cancelled and replaced by what became the Challenger 1 which the FV432 armoured personnel carrier could not. The project was begun in 1972; GKN Defence won the production contract in 1984 and the Warrior was accepted for service with the British Army in November 1984. Production commenced in January 1986 at Telford, with the first vehicles completed in December that year. GKN Defence was purchased by BAE Systems, via Alvis plc. 

The first production vehicle was handed over to the Army in May 1987 to 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, and from 1988 to 1990 four more armoured infantry battalions in the British Army of the Rhine were converted to the new vehicle. A total of 789 FV510 and variants were manufactured for the British Army and 254 of a modified version (Desert Warrior) were produced for the Kuwaiti Army.

==Description==
The Warrior incorporates several design features in keeping with the UK&#x27;s battlefield experience. In particular, there are no firing ports in the hull, in line with British thinking that the role of the armoured personnel carrier/infantry fighting vehicle (APC/IFV) is to carry troops under protection to the objective and then give firepower support when they have disembarked. The absence of firing ports also allows &quot;appliqué&quot; armour to be fitted to the sides of the vehicle, which is invariably applied to Warriors on operations. The cage armour used at one stage was replaced in 2007 by &quot;Wrap Two&quot; &quot;appliqué&quot; armour. The basic armour provides all-around protection against small arms ball ammunition. 
The crew of a Warrior comprises the driver, seated in the front hull and the gunner and commander in the turret. The embarked infantry section can number up to seven soldiers, who are seated facing each other in the rear hull compartment. Passenger access is through an electric ram powered door at the rear of the hull, rather than a drop-down ramp as in the US M113 APC and M2 Bradley IFV. Warrior Section Vehicles are able to carry seven fully equipped soldiers together with supplies and weapons, including a number of anti-tank weapons, for a 48-hour battlefield day in nuclear/biological/chemical conditions.
The Warrior is driven by a Perkins-Rolls-Royce V8 Condor engine through a four-speed automatic gearbox. It is capable of a road speed of . The Warrior has the speed and performance to keep up with a Challenger 2 main battle tank over the most difficult terrain.

The vehicle is fitted with a two-man GKN Sankey turret, armed with a non-stabilised L21A1 30 mm RARDEN cannon capable of destroying some APCs at a maximum range of , and an L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm Hughes Helicopters coaxial chain gun. It is fitted with two clusters of four defensive grenade launchers (usually used with Visual and Infrared Screening Smoke VIRSS).

All Warrior Infantry Section Vehicles are now equipped with Bowman radios, which replaced the earlier Clansman radios, for enhanced communications, command and control. When first introduced, the vehicles were fitted with passive image intensifier night vision sights. These have since been replaced with Thales Optronics Battle Group Thermal Imaging (BGTI) sights to upgrade night fighting capabilities, with 8× magnification. As of 2007, 350 vehicles were fitted with BGTI.

==Combat history==
* Operation Granby (Gulf War)
* Operation Grapple (United Nations duties in Bosnia with the UNPROFOR)
* Operation Resolute (NATO IFOR (Implementation Force) Bosnia 1996)
* Operation Telic (Iraq from 2003)
* Operation Herrick (Afghanistan with ISAF)

The protection against small arms, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank mines was shown during the UN operations in Bosnia. Two Warriors were destroyed during the First Gulf War, with nine soldiers killed, in a friendly fire incident when hit by AGM-65 Maverick missiles launched in error by two American Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft.

As of 17 November 2008, 22 soldiers had been killed while travelling in Warrior IFVs in Afghanistan or Iraq. On 7 March 2012, six British soldiers were killed in an explosion that hit a Warrior IFV in Helmand.

==Variants==
* FV510 Infantry Section Vehicle. This is the principal version operated by the British Army, as described above. 489 were produced (including 105 as platforms for the mobility of anti-tank guided weapon teams, originally equipped with MILAN and later with Javelin missiles).
* FV511 Infantry Command Vehicle. 84 of these were produced.

* FV512 Mechanised Combat Repair Vehicle. Operated by REME detachments in Armoured Infantry battalions. It is equipped with a 6.5-tonne crane plus power tools and is able to tow a trailer carrying two Warrior power packs or one Challenger power pack. 105 of these were produced.

* FV513 Mechanised Recovery Vehicle (Repair). Also operated by REME detachments in Armoured Infantry battalions. It is equipped with a 20-tonne winch and 6.5-tonne crane plus power tools and (like the FV512) is able to tow a trailer carrying two Warrior power packs or one Challenger power pack. 39 of these were produced.
* FV514 Mechanised Artillery Observation Vehicle. This is operated by the Royal Artillery as an Artillery Observation Post Vehicle (OPV) and is fitted with mast-mounted Man-packable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR) and Position and Azimuth Determining System (PADS), with image intensifying and infra-red equipment. The only armament is the 7.62 mm machine gun, as the 30 mm RARDEN cannon is replaced by a dummy weapon. This allows space for the targeting and surveillance equipment while still keeping largely the same outward appearance of a standard Warrior in order to avoid becoming a priority target. 52 of these were produced.

* FV515 Battery Command Vehicle. This is operated by the Royal Artillery. 19 of these were produced.
* Desert Warrior. This was an export version adapted for operations in hostile desert conditions. It was fitted with the Delco turret as used on the LAV-25 wheeled IFV, mounting a stabilised 25 mm M242 Bushmaster chain gun with coaxial 7.62 mm chain gun and two Hughes TOW ATGM launchers (one mounted on each side). In 1993, Kuwait purchased 254 Desert Warrior vehicles.
* Warrior 2000. This was a new version developed for the Swiss Army. It did not enter production. It featured an all-welded aluminium hull, increased armour, digital fire control system and more powerful engine. It was fitted with the Delco turret, or a Land Systems Hagglunds E30 turret with Alliant Techsystems 30 mm Bushmaster II Mk 44 cannon.
* Armoured Ambulance. Six Warriors, with armaments removed, were converted to armoured ambulances for use in Afghanistan during Operation Herrick.
* VERDI-2 (Vehicle Electronics Research Defence Initiative) was a technology demonstrator built on the hull of an FV510 in 1993. It utilized the 40mm CTAI cannon, in addition to eight Starstreak missiles in two quad launchers, as well as the ADAD system later seen on the Stormer HVM. It did not enter production.
*Optionally-Crewed Warrior. In late 2018, an optionally-crewed variant of the vehicle was demonstrated as part of the British Army&#x27;s Army Warfighting Experiment 2018 &#x27;Autonomous Warrior&#x27;. This was delivered by British Engineering firm Digital Concepts Engineering. The system was capable of remote operation over distance using a wireless mesh network over radio. Funding to explore the concept further was announced by Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson in March 2019 but appears to have been de-prioritised since.

==Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme==

Upgrades already fitted to Warriors in British Army service included the Bowman Communications System and Thales Battle Group Thermal Imaging (BGTI) night sights. However the British Army determined that a bigger upgrade programme was required to extend its service life to 2040.

The Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme (WCSP) was to involve upgrading 380 Warriors with the Warrior Modular Protection System (WMPS) and Warrior Enhanced Electronic Architecture (WEEA). Within that group, 245 vehicles would have been fitted with a new turret and weapon system under the Warrior Fightability Lethality Improvement Programme (WFLIP). The remainder, which would have been designated as Armoured Battlefield Support Vehicles (ABSV), would have lacked turrets and carry out field repair and recovery roles using a winch and crane attachments. The ABSV was however, removed in Annual Budget Cycle 16 as a cost saving. In an oral evidence on 20 October 2020, with the Deputy Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Christopher Tickell stating it would be in service by 2030, aiming to replace the FV430 Bulldog.

BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin competed for the WCSP contracts. Lockheed Martin&#x27;s WFLIP upgrade was based on the existing Warrior turret. BAE Systems designed a new turret. In March 2011, it was announced that Lockheed Martin had effectively won the competition to develop both the WFLIP and the FRES turrets. Severe budgetary pressures made it uncertain whether these defence projects were to be delayed or curtailed, but it was announced in October 2011 that the Warrior upgrades would proceed at a cost of £1bn, extending the service life of the Warrior to 2040 and beyond. The scheduled in-service date for upgraded Warriors was 2018.
Under the WFLI programme, the existing turret including the unstabilised Rarden gun, would be replaced by a turret mounting a stabilised 40 mm weapon developed by the Anglo-French firm CTA International and firing Cased telescoped ammunition. This weapon would also equip the Ajax armoured vehicle.

By March 2020 Warrior CSP was in the &quot;demonstration phase&quot;, demonstrating capability for a range of military missions set by the MoD. A total of £430m had been spent so far. No in-service date had been set, but the demonstration phase was due to finish in 2021. In June 2020 the House of Commons Defence Select Committee described the project as running over three years late and £227 million over budget.

===Cancellation===
In March 2021 the MoD announced that the CSP had been cancelled and that all of the British Army&#x27;s Warrior vehicles would be replaced by the middle of the decade with Boxer armoured fighting vehicles. In April 2021 Lockheed Martin announced that as a result up to 158 jobs would be lost at Ampthill. It had previously been reported in October 2020 that the UK may procure Boxer vehicles that are fitted with the 40mm CTA International CT40 cannon.

Following the cancellation of the CSP Leicestershire-based Digital Concepts Engineering has proposed a system to stabilise the Warrior’s 30mm Rarden cannon, allowing the vehicle to fire on the move. The upgrade would additionally provide a digital turret interface facilitating the addition of a vehicle battle management system and ‘slew to cue’ capability to reduce the cognitive burden on the gunner.

<text>The Latvian diplomatic service in exile was the only governmental body of the Republic of Latvia which continued its activities during the Nazi and Soviet occupation of Latvia during 1940–1991. Latvian diplomats who were stationed in embassies and consulates at the moment of the occupation in 1940, refused to recognize the occupation and return to Soviet Latvia. They continued to formally represent the interests of Latvia in countries that did not recognize the Soviet annexation. After the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991, the diplomats started reporting to the restored Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

==Background==
Latvia was occupied on June 17, 1940, by Red Army troops and officially annexed to the Soviet Union on August 5, 1940 in the form of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.

One month before the occupation, on 17 May 1940 the Cabinet of Ministers granted extraordinary powers to Kārlis Zariņš, Latvia’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Mr. Zariņš was authorised to defend Latvia’s interests, supervise the work of Latvia’s representations abroad and handle their finances and property. This created a legal basis for the functioning of the diplomatic service in the absence of a legal government in Latvia.

The United States never recognized the forcible and illegal annexation of the Baltic States in conformity with the principles of the Stimson Doctrine (US Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles’s Declaration of July 23, 1940), and more than 50 countries followed this position.

The work of the diplomatic service was financed from Latvian gold reserves in foreign banks.

==Activity==
During the occupation, Latvian diplomatic missions continued their work in Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Latvian diplomatic service regularly issued official statements regarding the illegality of the Soviet occupation and annexation of Latvia as well as regarding Latvia’s right to restore its national independence. It was also protecting the interests of Latvian citizens abroad and the Latvian property abroad. In 1947 a joint communication on the occupation of Baltic states to the UN was sent by the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian diplomats abroad. The Baltic Appeal to the United Nations (now &quot;Baltic Association to the United Nations&quot;) was formed in 1966.

On March 26, 1949, the US State Department issued a circular stating that the Baltic states were still independent nations with their own diplomatic representatives.

In 1969, the Latvian Counselor to the US Anatols Dinbergs, among leaders of 73 countries around the world, signed the Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages on behalf of the Latvian nation.

Nevertheless, Latvia was not allowed to establish a government-in-exile in any Western country or sign the Declaration of the United Nations (1942), as Latvian diplomats wished. The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued formal protests against the Baltic diplomatic missions remaining open in Washington DC and elsewhere. In Canada the official list of diplomats included the offices of the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the early 1960s that caused the Soviet Embassy in Canada to refuse to receive the lists distributed by the Canadian Department of External Affairs. Eventually, the UK excluded the Baltic diplomats from the Diplomatic List, but as a compromise Baltic diplomats continued to be accepted as possessing a diplomatic character by His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Governments.

The Latvian diplomatic service in exile actively co-operated with organizations of the Latvian diaspora in joint efforts to keep Western countries from formally recognizing Latvia’s annexation by the USSR. The existence of the exiled diplomatic service was another demonstration of the illegality of the annexation.

==Transition of mandate after restoration of independence==
The exiled diplomatic service of Latvia played an important role during the restoration of independence of Latvia in 1988 - 1990 and in ensuring the legal continuity between the newly independent Latvian state and the interwar Latvian Republic.

Latvia&#x27;s parliament officially restored the country’s full independence on the 21 August 1991 in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt. Wide international recognition of restored independence started after that, and the legations and consulates of the exiled diplomatic service were transferred to the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Anatols Dinbergs, the last head of the diplomatic service in exile, was promoted to the rank of Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations (September - December 1991) as well as Ambassador to the United States (1991–1992).

<doc id="1158054" wikidata="Q786964" url="?curid=1158054" title="Lazuli bunting">
<text>The lazuli bunting (Passerina amoena) is a North American songbird named for the gemstone lapis lazuli.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 5.1–5.9 in (13–15 cm)
* Weight: 0.5–0.6 oz (13–18 g)
* Wingspan: 8.7 in (22 cm)
The male is easily recognized by its bright blue head and back (lighter than the closely related indigo bunting), its conspicuous white wingbars, and its light rusty breast and white belly. The color pattern may suggest the eastern and western bluebirds, but the smaller size (13–15 cm or 5–5.9 inches long), wingbars, and short and conical bunting bill quickly distinguish it. The female is brown, grayer above and warmer underneath, told from the female indigo bunting by two thin and pale wingbars and other plumage details.

==Call==
The song is a high, rapid, strident warble, similar to that of the indigo bunting but longer and with less repetition.

==Distribution and habitat==
Lazuli buntings breed mostly west of the 100th meridian from southern Canada to northern Texas, central New Mexico and Arizona, and southern California. On the Pacific coast their breeding range extends south to extreme northwestern Baja California. They migrate to southeastern Arizona and Mexico. Their habitat is brushy areas and sometimes weedy pastures, generally well-watered, and sometimes in towns.

==Diet==
They eat mostly seeds and insects. They may feed conspicuously on the ground or in bushes, but singing males are often very elusive in treetops.

==Breeding==
It makes a loose cup nest of grasses and rootlets placed in a bush. It lays three or four pale blue eggs. In the eastern and southern part of its range, it often hybridizes with the indigo bunting.

<text>Philip Van Horne Lansdale (15 February 1858 – 1 April 1899) was an officer in the United States Navy.

==Biography==
Lansdale, born in Washington, D.C., graduated as Passed Midshipman from the Naval Academy 18 June 1879. Commissioned ensign 1 June 1881, he served on Asiatic, North Atlantic, and with the Mediterranean and Pacific Squadrons. Promoted to lieutenant 15 May 1893, he became executive officer of the protected cruiser upon her recommissioning at San Francisco 9 July 1898.

After visiting Honolulu for ceremonies which transferred the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Islands to the United States, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Kautz, Commander, Pacific Station, arrived Apia, Samoa, 6 March 1899. An unstable political climate, created by rival Samoan factions and German presence, erupted into open hostility during the month. A combined American and British naval force sought to keep the peace, but natives attacked American and British consulates late in March. 

A British and American landing party set out from Apia in late March. On 1 April during a mission to drive off the forces under King Mataafa. With Lieutenant Lansdale in command, the landing party was ambushed and forced to retreat after a fierce fight near Vailele.

While protecting the evacuation of a mortally wounded machinegunner, Lieutenant Lansdale was seriously wounded, his right leg shattered by an enemy bullet. Ensign John R. Monaghan, Seaman Norman Edsall and another sailor, began carrying Lansdale. Both enlisted men were killed and Monaghan had dropped from exhaustion when Lansdale pled, “Monny, you leave me now, I cannot go any further”; Ensign Monaghan remained beside the fallen lieutenant. With only one rifle between them, they were soon overrun and killed by pursuing Mataafan Samoan forces.

==Namesakes==
Three ships, USS &quot;Lansdale&quot;, have been named for him.

<text>Beryl Fleur Karney (31 December 1930 – 11 October 2022), also known as Beryl Goldwyn, was an English ballet dancer.

Born near London, she started dancing at the age of three. She attended the Royal Ballet School and performed with the Royal Ballet in &quot;The Sleeping Princess&quot; (&quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;), with Dame Margot Fonteyn, when the Royal Opera House reopened after the World War II in 1946.

Goldwyn danced in 1946 with the Anglo Polish Ballet, a wartime troupe originally formed to provide work for Polish dancers in exile. The company was disbanded six months later, but not without first dancing at the Saville Theatre on London&#x27;s West End.

She joined the Ballet Rambert in 1949, later becoming its prima ballerinaGoldwyn danced numerous roles, including &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, Gala Performance, and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, She was fortunate early in her career to find an ideal partner in Alexander Bennett. She first impressed with the chamber ballets revived as part of Ballet at Eight , the final performances of Rambert at the tiny Mercury Theater in Notting Hill Gate. Goldwyn got to know the choreography of Walter Gore and Antony Tudor. Her most celebrated was the part of &quot;Giselle&quot;. The Times newspaper wrote that she was “the most moving Giselle that Britain can offer”, this was at a time when Margot Fonteyn was also performing the role at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. While in The Observer Richard Buckle described what a bore it was “to have to traipse out to Sadler&#x27;s Wells and see . . . some girl one has never heard of in the title role”, but admitted leaving the theatre astonished.

In 1954, when Roberto Rossellini staged &quot;Joan of Arc at the Stake&quot; at the Stoll Theatre, London for his wife Ingrid Bergman, it was preceded by the first act of &quot;Giselle&quot;, the celebrated ballet critic of the Financial Times, Andrew Porter later wrote (in 1971) that &quot;with Beryl Goldwyn as its delightful heroine , the Honegger work (&quot;Joan of Ark at the Stake&quot;) did not stand much of a chance&quot;.

When John Cranko choreographed the two ballets for Rambert: &quot;The Lady with her Shadow&quot; in &quot;Variations on a Theme&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Girl in Black&quot; in &quot;La Reja&quot; (1959), he chose Goldwyn for the lead roles. Robert Joffrey cast her as Marie Taglioni in his ballet &quot;Pas de Déesses&quot;.

She performed in the UK, Ireland, France (at Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and at the Aix-les-Bains Festival), Germany, Italy (at La Fenice in Venice), and the United States (at the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow festival), and at the Baalbeck International Festival in Lebanon, where she shared the programme with the Lebanese singer Fairuz. In 1996–97, she performed again with the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, with Sylvie Guillem, fifty years after her first performance there.

She represented Ballet Dancers on the Council of British Actors Equity and in this capacity, she was consulted before Rudolf Nureyev was granted his work permit to perform in the UK.

Following her retirement from the Ballet Rambert she taught ballet for the Inner London Education Authority. She also studied painting with Maggi Hambling and exhibited her works at Saint Martin&#x27;s Gallery in London in May 1991. She also studied Flamenco dancing in Seville with Milagros Mengibar, the celebrated flamenco dancer.

For the 90th birthday celebrations of the Ballet Rambert, she took part in the &quot;Rambert at 90 Oral History Project&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In 1969, she married scientist, engineer and businessman Andrew Karney; their son Peter was born in 1972. Goldwyn died of cancer on 11 October 2022, at the age of 91.

<text>Foggydog Glacier is a glacier between the Blank Peaks and Mount Rich in the Brown Hills of Antarctica. It was mapped by the Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition (1962–63) and so named because in plan the glacier is shaped like the head and neck of a dog, with a moraine suggesting a collar and a glacial lake in the position of the ears. Fog accumulates regularly over the glacier.

<text>The Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway is a minimum-gauge railway that primarily serves holidaymakers in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, England. It operates from near the Cleethorpes Leisure Centre, running to the mouth of the Buck Beck.

==History==
The CCLR began as the &quot;Cleethorpes Miniature Railway&quot; in 1948, and ran for a distance of near the sea front in Cleethorpes. The line was relocated and extended the following year, and between 1949 and 1971 ran southwards for from &quot;Cleethorpes Town&quot; to &quot;Thrunscoe&quot; (near the current &quot;Discovery Halt&quot;). The line was extended at both ends in 1972: the northern terminus was relocated slightly closer to the town centre, while at its southern end it now ran as far as the Zoo.

It became the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway when it was privatised in 1991, and the new company renamed the termini &quot;Kingsway&quot; and &quot;Witts End&quot;. &quot;Witts End&quot; (located at zoo, which by this time had closed to visitors) was abandoned in 1994, and a new southern terminus was built at &quot;Meridian&quot; (now &quot;Lakeside&quot;). A new extension from &quot;Lakeside&quot; to &quot;Humberston North Sea Lane&quot; was opened in 2007, lengthening the railway from to .

In the 1960s, the line used battery locomotives. On being regauged in the 1970s, two Rio Grande steam outline locomotives built by Severn Lamb were used. Since being taken into private ownership, a variety of steam and diesel locomotives have been used, followed by petrol-driven engines with a steam outline, though genuine steam locomotives are now in operation. A National Lottery grant enabled the railways supporter association to acquire stock from the long-dismantled Sutton Miniature Railway in Sutton Park, Sutton Coldfield, including Bassett-Lowke Class 10 Little Giant &#x27;Mighty Atom.&#x27;

The railway held the Olympic Torch on Day 39 of the 2012 Olympic Torch relay with BMR locomotive &#x27;Mountaineer&#x27; hauling the Alan Keef &#x27;Council Rake&#x27; carriages from Kingsway station to Lakeside station.

The railway was sold to Cleethorpes Light Railway Limited in May 2014 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in July 2018. The railway also had its 75th Anniversary in July 2023

==Present operations==
Trains run from Cleethorpes Kingsway station, next to Cleethorpes Leisure Centre, over a viaduct and along the sea wall, turning SSW to run past the sheds to the intermediate main station named Lakeside. The track will continue south-east to a station named Humberston, close to the Meridian Line car park, and the mouth of the Buck Beck.

The Humberston section of the line has been closed to the public since the 2019 running season due to level crossings in need of upgrades.

==Stations==
*Cleethorpes Kingsway: Original station dismantled in 1998 and the current station built and opened in 1999 with a viaduct over the boating lake on way into the station. Station building houses a gift shop.
*Discovery Halt: No longer in use, but platform exists, accessed by means of footpath alongside.
*Lakeside: The main terminus with engine sheds and workshops, passing loop and on the platforms a cafe, multi-function space and the Signal Box Inn &#x27;The Smallest Pub on the Planet&#x27;.

<text>The Mayer f-function is an auxiliary function that often appears in the series expansion of thermodynamic quantities related to classical many-particle systems. It is named after chemist and physicist Joseph Edward Mayer.

==Definition==
Consider a system of classical particles interacting through a pair-wise potential
:formula_1
where the bold labels formula_2 and formula_3 denote the continuous degrees of freedom associated with the particles, e.g., 
:formula_4
for spherically symmetric particles and
:formula_5
for rigid non-spherical particles where formula_6 denotes position and formula_7 the orientation parametrized e.g. by Euler angles. The Mayer f-function is then defined as
:formula_8
where formula_9 the inverse absolute temperature in units of energy−1 .

<text>Retro Active is a compilation album by the English rock band Def Leppard, released in 1993. The album features touched-up versions of B-sides and previously unreleased recordings from the band&#x27;s recording sessions from 1984 to 1993. The album charted at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Overview==
After releasing only five albums over the course of a twelve-year period, Def Leppard used &quot;Retro Active&quot; to break that habit, provide a treat for diehard fans, and close the door on the &quot;Steve Clark&quot; era of the band. Many of the tracks had previously been released as single B-sides.

According to singer Joe Elliott, the concept behind the album was envisioned after the success of the &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot; single. The song had originally been demoed solely by Elliott as an electric version in 1989, and was subsequently recorded by the band as an acoustic ballad at the suggestion of guitarist Phil Collen. When the producers of the film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; contacted the band in 1993 to provide a new song for the soundtrack, the band were unable to record new material due to touring schedules and instead sent over the multitrack tape of the acoustic version of &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot;, which was given strings by conductor Michael Kamen in April 1993 and included onto the film soundtrack. It would become the band&#x27;s last Top 20 single in the US, reaching No. 12, and inspired the band to put the album together and re-record the electric version of the song.

&quot;She&#x27;s Too Tough&quot; and the electric version of &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot; were both B-sides included as bonus tracks on Japanese pressings of &quot;Adrenalize&quot;. Written in 1985, &quot;She&#x27;s Too Tough&quot; first appeared on the Helix album &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; in 1987. &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot;, meanwhile, was first written and demoed by guitarist Collen in 1991 and was originally recorded by the Law, a band featuring Paul Rodgers and the Who drummer Kenney Jones, for their self-titled album in 1991. Def Leppard later recorded their own version in April the following year, which they released as a B-side on the &quot;Make Love Like a Man&quot; single. After the band had recorded the new vocal, bass and drum parts for the electric version of the song, Collen overheard Elliott experimenting with the song on a piano. This led Elliott to record a piano and vocal version of the song, after which Collen, bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen added acoustic and electric guitars, bass guitar and drum parts in June 1993, creating the acoustic version that would be released as a single.

Two unfinished songs from the &quot;Hysteria&quot; recording sessions, &quot;Desert Song&quot; and &quot;Fractured Love&quot;, were completed exclusively for the album. The album also features several covers, namely Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Action&quot; (which charted higher than the original in the UK) and Mick Ronson&#x27;s &quot;Only After Dark&quot;.

The version of &quot;Ride into the Sun&quot; on the compilation is not the same as that which appeared on &quot;The Def Leppard E.P.&quot;, but rather the 1987 re-recording. It differs slightly from the original B-side from the &quot;Hysteria&quot; era; the B-side featured a Rick Allen drum solo intro, whereas the version on &quot;Retro Active&quot; has a piano intro provided by Ian Hunter.

&quot;Retro Active&quot; features a hidden (final) track: a piano/vocal version of &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat&quot;, which also features an alternate acoustic guitar solo by Collen.

This is the first Def Leppard album to feature songs recorded with newly added guitarist Vivian Campbell.

==Album cover==

The album cover, by Nels Israelson and Hugh Syme, is a photograph of a lady sitting at a dressing table, looking in a mirror. However, if the cover is viewed at arm&#x27;s length or from a distance, it takes the form of a skull (a type of vanitas art), the woman&#x27;s head forming the left eye socket, and her reflected head in the mirror forming the right eye socket. The mirror itself forms the shape of the skull and the accessories on the dressing table form the nose, nostrils and teeth. It was inspired by Charles Allan Gilbert&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;All Is Vanity&quot; (1892). An alternate version of the album cover exists, only released for promotional use. The only difference is the Def Leppard logo is represented in the most traditional style seen on &quot;Pyromania&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot; and &quot;Adrenalize&quot;. The band felt that, given &quot;Retro Active&quot;″s sonically darker tone, that it would be best to shelve the bright colours of the logo.

==Reception==
In a 3.5 out of 5 review, Sputnikmusic wrote that while the compilation &quot;cannot be rated super highly, it is extremely rare for a compilation album such as this to do so. With that in mind, this is indeed a pleasant surprise which will at least please some of Def Leppard’s longtime fans due to the relatively organic production levels used here. Importantly, a wise balance of song types is included within the 46 minute (60 if the three alternate versions are counted) duration, meaning that the accessible tracks resulted in this album still selling well and deservedly going top 10 in both the U.S &amp; U.K.&quot;

Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic gave particular praise to &quot;Desert Song&quot; and &quot;Fractured Love&quot;, citing them as &quot;Retro Active&quot;&#x27;s &quot;most distinctive tracks, harkening back to the band&#x27;s early (pre-success) days with their rough power chords.&quot; He concludes by saying that overall, &quot;this is an interesting release which marks the end of a long chapter in the band&#x27;s history, following the death of guitarist and guiding force Steve Clark. While casual fans might find it confusing, Leppard fanatics will revel in its diversity and informative liner notes.&quot;

Rating the compilation 4 out of 5, Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes that the band&#x27;s &quot;chief strength has always been the songs they write, and &quot;Retro Active&quot; underscores that appeal. From the Zeplike &quot;Desert Song&quot; to &quot;She&#x27;s Too Tough&quot; and its feisty rock &amp; roll, from the power ballad &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot; to &quot;Ride Into the Sun,&quot; a raver from their 1979 debut, this is premium pop-metal - sharp hooks and engaging thunder.&quot;

<doc id="1158077" wikidata="Q1541365" url="?curid=1158077" title="Renaissance Center">
<text>The Renaissance Center, commonly known as the RenCen, is a complex of seven connected skyscrapers in downtown Detroit, Michigan, United States. Located on the Detroit International Riverfront, the RenCen is owned and used by General Motors as its world headquarters. The complex includes a 73-story Marriott hotel at its center, surrounded by four 39-story office towers, connected by a large square podium containing public spaces, a conference center, retail stores, restaurants, and a company showroom.

Developed as an urban renewal project in the 1970s, the Renaissance Center was envisioned as a &quot;city-within-a-city,&quot; and was meant to anchor a wider redevelopment of the then-declining city of Detroit. The project was developed and funded by a consortium led by the Ford Motor Company, and John Portman served as its principal architect. The five original towers were built in the Modern architectural style and completed in 1977, with two matching towers added later in 1981.

General Motors purchased the Renaissance Center in 1996, and relocated its global headquarters to the complex. An extensive renovation, completed in 2004, significantly altered its Brutalist interior, improved access to the center from downtown, and added a new glass retail atrium and public plaza on the riverfront.

A distinctive feature of Detroit&#x27;s skyline, the RenCen is widely considered to be a landmark and cultural icon of the city. With of usable space, it is one of the world&#x27;s largest commercial complexes, and the central tower has been the tallest building in Michigan since its completion in 1977. At the time of its completion, the Renaissance Center was the largest private development in the history of the United States, and the central tower was the world&#x27;s tallest hotel.

In recent years, the massive center has struggled with declining occupancy, particularly stemming from increased remote work amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. General Motors has announced plans to relocate its headquarters away from the Renaissance Center in 2025, leaving the future of the complex uncertain. Redevelopment of the RenCen is currently under consideration, and could include full or partial demolition.

==History==
The idea was first conceived by Henry Ford II, then-chairman of the Ford Motor Company. In 1970, to bring his idea to life, Ford teamed up with other business leaders to form the Detroit Renaissance. This was a private non-profit development organization which Ford headed in order to stimulate building activity and revitalize the economy of Detroit. Henry Ford II sold the concept of the RenCen to the City and community leaders. Detroit Mayor Roman Gribbs touted the project as &quot;a complete rebuilding from bridge to bridge,&quot; referring to the area between the Ambassador Bridge, that connects Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, and the MacArthur Bridge, which connects the city with Belle Isle Park.

The Detroit Renaissance announced the first phase of construction in 1971, receiving primary financing from the Ford Motor Company. It soon became the world&#x27;s largest private development with an anticipated 1971 cost of $500 million. The principal architect was John Portman, the architect behind the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, Georgia; the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, California; and the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

The &quot;city within a city&quot; arose. The first phase of Renaissance Center opened on July 1, 1976. For phase I, the facade of the first five towers was covered with of glass, and used about of concrete. This did not include the additional glass used for the atriums. It also cost $337 million to construct, employing 7,000 workers. The heating and cooling systems for the buildings were housed in two-story concrete berms facing Jefferson Avenue. Other phases that included residences, additional office and retail space were never constructed.

When the Renaissance Center opened, the cylindrical central tower was originally the flagship of Westin Hotels. The top three floors of the hotel hosted an upscale restaurant, The Summit, that rotated to allow a 360 degree view. The shopping center in the podium originally housed high-end boutiques, but now contains a greater complement of restaurants in the retail mix.

In 1977, managed by Western International Hotels, the central hotel tower of the Renaissance Center opened as the Detroit Plaza Hotel. It became the world&#x27;s tallest all-hotel skyscraper surpassing its architectural twin, the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta. Its opening ended the Penobscot Building&#x27;s 49-year reign as the tallest building in Michigan. The hotel was later renamed The Westin Hotel Renaissance Center Detroit. In 1986, it was surpassed in height by The Westin Stamford in Singapore. Since, the Renaissance Center&#x27;s central tower has held the distinction as the tallest all-hotel skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere.

On April 15, 1977, Henry Ford II and Detroit mayor Coleman Young unveiled a plaque commemorating the private investors whose funds made the project possible. Later that evening, 650 business and society leaders attended a benefit to celebrate the Renaissance Center&#x27;s formal dedication. The money raised from the $300-per-couple tickets went to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. 

During the 1980 Republican National Convention, hosted at nearby Joe Louis Arena, presidential nominee Ronald Reagan and former President Gerald Ford both stayed at the Renaissance Center.

In 1987, the elevated Detroit People Mover transit line began operation with a stop at the Renaissance Center.

=== General Motors ownership ===
In 1996, General Motors purchased the complex and moved its world headquarters from what is now the historic Cadillac Place state office complex in the New Center district, to the Renaissance Center, in downtown Detroit. Meanwhile, Ford Motor Company maintained offices in one of the towers in the center. Before the acquisition, Sibley&#x27;s Shoes had its headquarters in the center.

In December 2001, General Motors unveiled the &quot;Wintergarden&quot; retail atrium. Designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, it rises tall at its highest point opening direct access to the International Riverfront. In addition, the atrium contains of retail space and of contiguous main floor exhibit space which was used by the media during Super Bowl XL.

The $500 million renovation of the Renaissance Center completed in 2003 has helped improve Detroit&#x27;s economy. Together, GM&#x27;s renovation of the Renaissance Center and the Detroit Riverwalk exceeded $1 billion; the project constituted a substantial investment in downtown. More than 10,000 people (of whom 6,000 are GM employees) work in the complex. Nearly 2,000 state workers now occupy GM&#x27;s former office building, the restored Cadillac Place, in the historic New Center district.

Architects&#x27; initial design for the Renaissance Center focused on creating secure &quot;interior spaces&quot;, while its design later expanded and improved to connect with the exterior spaces and waterfront through a reconfigured interior, open glass entryways, and a winter garden. By 2004, GM completed an extensive $500 million renovation of the Renaissance Center. This included a $100 million makeover for the hotel. Among GM&#x27;s first actions was to remove the concrete berms facing Jefferson Avenue. The renovation includes a lighted glass walkway which encircles the interior mezzanine for ease of navigation, while the addition of the winter garden provides riverfront access and a view of Canada. A covered skyway over Jefferson Avenue connects to the Millender Center, Courtyard by Marriott - Downtown Detroit, and Coleman A. Young Municipal Center.

The Wintergarden added to the Renaissance Center faces the Riverfront and provides panoramic views of the Windsor skyline. The complex connects offices, the hotel, retail specialty shops, restaurants, a jazz club, and a movie theater. The theater has since closed and been converted to offices. A pedestrian-friendly glass entryway has replaced the former concrete berms along Jefferson Avenue. The redevelopment provides the &quot;GM World&quot; display of vehicles, a restored hotel, a renovated rooftop restaurant, and the addition of GM&#x27;s corporate logo to crown the top of the building. Construction of the lighted glass walkway facilitates ease of navigation encircling the interior mezzanine. Hines completed redevelopment of Towers 500 and 600 for GM in 2004.

The Riverfront Promenade was dedicated on December 17, 2004, and helped to usher in a return to recreational uses along Detroit&#x27;s International Riverfront. GM played a key role in the transformation of the east riverfront with a donation of $135 million to the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy for the development of a world class riverfront promenade planned at $559 million, which included $50 million from the Kresge foundation. In 2011, the Detroit Wayne County Port Authority opened its new state of the art cruise ship dock and passenger terminal on Hart Plaza, adjacent to the Renaissance Center. Port authority bonds financed another 1,500 space parking garage adjacent to the Renaissance Center. Further upriver, the Roberts Riverwalk Hotel faces the east riverfront. In addition to the gradual continuation of the riverfront promenade, other planned projects complementing the Renaissance Center continue along the International Riverfont which include development of luxury condominiums, a cruise ship passenger terminal, retail, and entertainment venues.

In 2011, the Renaissance Center added colored LED lighting on the top of its towers (Towers 500 and 600 utilize traditional blue floodlights to illuminate their top floors). General Motors added a large illuminated LED corporate logo which also displays GM divisions. The animated logo and illuminated LED color bands around the towers can be used to support special events and may be seen from Comerica Park, home of the Detroit Tigers. The renovation of TCF Center convention and exhibit facility incorporates similar blue neon lighting along riverfront promenade.

In July 2010, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan announced plans to lease of Tower 500 and Tower 600 and relocate 3,000 of its employees from its building in Southfield, Michigan.

In January 2015, General Motors announced its intent to renovate much of the complex to make it more inviting as a destination for visitors to Detroit. That July, the complex was re-branded as &quot;The GMRENCEN, and&quot; Its logo was modernized and &quot;Reflecting a New Detroit&quot; was introduced as the new tagline. A photo-journalistic advertising campaign launched to &quot;shine a spotlight on the people in Detroit who make remarkable contributions&quot; to the city.

The Renaissance Center is owned by General Motors. The hotel in the central tower is now managed by the Marriott hotel chain and is called the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center. The 1,298-room hotel is one of the largest operated by Marriott. The rooftop restaurant (which previously had revolved) received a $10 million renovation and was operated by The Epicurean Groups&#x27;s Coach Insignia (closed in 2017). It served Coach wines, a product of the Fisher family whose legacy includes Fisher Body, a name which is part of GM history.

The Renaissance Center&#x27;s renovation provides for the prospect of continued development and restorations throughout the city. Architectural critics have touted the city&#x27;s architecture as among North America&#x27;s finest.

In its first year of operation it generated over $1 billion in economic growth for the downtown. Detroit Renaissance continued to interact with the city, by contributing to a variety of projects within the downtown area in the ensuing decades.

=== General Motors exit and redevelopment ===
On April 15, 2024, GM announced its intention to move its headquarters from the Renaissance Center to the under-construction Hudson&#x27;s Detroit in 2025. GM publicly committed to redeveloping the RenCen, but their planned exit sparked public speculation that it could be demolished, a possibility which CEO Mary Barra declined to rule out. GM retained Bedrock Detroit, the real estate firm developing Hudson&#x27;s Detroit, to consult on the redevelopment.

GM and Bedrock revealed a conceptual plan for the RenCen&#x27;s redevelopment in November 2024. The plan calls for the demolition of two of the RenCen&#x27;s office towers, 300 and 400, and most of the existing public and retail spaces at its base. Under this plan, one of the remaining office towers would be converted to rental apartments; the central tower would remain a hotel, but its upper floors would also be converted to rental apartments.

The two companies stated that they planned to provide the majority of the $1.6 billion required for the proposed redevelopment, but they expect $250 million in subsidies from the state of Michigan, and $100 million in tax-increment financing from the Detroit Downtown Development Authority. The companies&#x27; demand for taxpayer funding of the project was met with public opposition by many state lawmakers, including Matt Hall, the speaker-elect of the Michigan House of Representatives. In response, General Motors later stated that if lawmakers did not provide taxpayer funding, they would demolish the entire RenCen at their own expense, a proposal described by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; as &quot;likely... the largest voluntary skyscraper demolition in world history.&quot; Opponents of the demolition likened the proposal to &quot;extortion&quot;.

==Location==
The Renaissance Center is a riverfront property located along the Detroit River. Approximately one-mile north of the center are Comerica Park and Ford Field, the respective venues for the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Lions. The US portal of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel emerges adjacent to the western boundary of the Renaissance Center. The Renaissance Center is also a station on the Detroit People Mover. Additionally a pedestrian skyway, over Jefferson Avenue, connects the complex to the Millender Center. Several blocks to the west of the Renaissance Center, along Jefferson Avenue, there are the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, Hart Plaza, Huntington Place (formerly Cobo Center, home to events such as the North American International Auto Show and Youmacon) and the Joe Louis Arena (former home of the Detroit Red Wings). The University of Detroit Mercy School of Law is located just across Jefferson Avenue. The Renaissance Center&#x27;s modernist architecture balances the city&#x27;s panoramic waterfront skyline, a frequent feature in photography taken from Windsor, Ontario, across the river. From the top of Renaissance Center&#x27;s previous Coach Insignia restaurant (closed in 2017), patrons were able to peer down upon the neogothic spires of the One Detroit Center and the city&#x27;s Financial District skyscrapers and stadiums. The view from the top extended for in all directions.

The Renaissance Center grounds constitute ZIP code 48243.

==Architecture==
The centerpiece is the 73-story 727-foot (221.5 m) luxury hotel with 1,246 rooms and 52 suites (1298 total guest rooms). Its height is measured from its main Wintergarden entrance on Atwater Street which faces the International Riverfront where the complex measures taller. Entirely owned by General Motors, the complex has of space. The main Renaissance Center complex rises from a site. The complex is designed in the modern architectural style with glass as a main material.
Famous for its cylindrical design, the central hotel tower&#x27;s diameter is . A lighted glass walkway radiates the mezzanine level and encircles the base of cylindrical hotel tower for ease of navigation. This ringed glass walkway is about wide and has a circumference of approximately or about one-eighth of a mile around. The ringed walkway&#x27;s diameter is approximately . It links to several other walkways in the complex. The five-story Wintergarden atrium leads into the central area which has an eight-story atrium lobby with rounded concrete balconies and terraces. The Highlands is located on Floors 71 through 73, which includes a restaurant, scotch bar, and special events space. The hotel has no floors labeled 7, 8, or 13. The hotel features a major conference center with of meeting space including a Renaissance Ballroom for up to 2,200 guests with for events, one of the largest in the United States.

John Portman designed the five-building rosette with &quot;interior spaces.&quot; In 1977, its central tower opened as the tallest hotel in the world. It remains the tallest all hotel skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere. The smaller cylinders on sides of all the towers house the elevators. The four surrounding 39-story office towers (100–400) each reach 522 feet (159 m) and have a total of of space. Each 39-story tower has a base five-story podium structure with for retail space for a total of . A portion of the central atrium area houses &quot;GM World&quot;, a showcase for GM vehicles. Two 21-story towers (500–600), designed by Portman and constructed in 1981, reach 339 feet (103 m). GM gained control of Towers 500 and 600 in 2001. Tower 500 has of office space and an additional of retail space. Tower 600 has of office space and an additional of retail space.

Towers 100 and 200 front Jefferson Avenue. Towers 300 and 400 are on the main Wintergarden/Atwater Street entrance facing the Riverfront. The GM Renaissance Conference Center is located on the second floor of tower 300.

The design is consistent with the themes of Brutalist architecture, especially in the heavy massing of concrete on the lower floors, but the 2001 renovation has softened those features.

The &quot;city within a city&quot; concept was duplicated in the suburb of Southfield, when the Southfield Town Center office complex - with five inter-connected golden skyscrapers and an overall area of - was constructed from 1975 to 1989. In the ensuing years, the Renaissance Center would face competition from the growing suburban office market.

===Redevelopment===
The redevelopment project included the work of many different architects including Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill of Chicago, SmithGroup of Detroit, and Ghafari Associates of Dearborn who did the renovation of the office towers. The majority of the construction operations were led by Turner Construction Company. The structural glass and steel for the Wintergarden, the entrance lobby as well as the mezzanine glass walkway were contributed by Mero. The cost of the renovation does not include the cost for reconfiguring the streets around the Renaissance Center or the cost of the park along the International Riverfront.
===Technical details and tenants===
In June 2015 the Ren Cen 4 Theatres theater complex announced that it was closing. With the end of Ren Cen 4, the city of Detroit has one first-run theater remaining, along with three independent theaters.

In July 2007 portions of Asian Village, a development of restaurants in Suite 2653 in the GM Center (200 Renaissance Center) with Asian cuisine offered, opened. The center was designed to evoke street food stalls within East and Southeast Asia.

== Security ==
Until 2024, the Renaissance Center was patrolled by the Renaissance Center Security Police, a private police force granted limited police powers by state law. Most of its officers carried firearms and were empowered to make misdemeanor arrests on Renaissance Center property. Security Police officers were employed by Securitas from 2001 to 2011, when General Motors awarded a new contract to G4S for security services beginning in January 2012, and formed the Renaissance Center Management Company, a joint venture majority owned by G4S. Allied Universal assumed these services, and the majority stake in the subsidiary, with their acquisition of G4S in 2021.

In November 2023, a report was published revealing a multiple lawsuits, complaints, and a whistleblower report accusing Security Police officers of racially profiling, harassing, assaulting, and illegally detaining Black visitors, in numerous incidents dating back to 2011. They alleged that officers had a radio code to indicate the presence of &quot;undesirables,&quot; and deleted video evidence to conceal illegal activities. Following these reports, the Michigan State Police opened an investigation into the officers&#x27; conduct. General Motors directed Allied Universal to remove the accused officers from its properties, mandated that all officers undergo racial sensitivity and de-escalation training, and stated that it would reconsider its relationship with the company. By December, GM revoked the officers&#x27; arrest authority, ordered them to stop carrying handcuffs, and reduced the number of armed officers. Renaissance Center Management Company surrendered its private policing license in March 2024, and the Security Police were replaced with standard Allied Universal security guards. In February 2025, General Motors hired Inter-Con Security to replace Allied as its security contractor for U.S. properties, including the RenCen.

<text>Universal design is the design of buildings, products or environments to make them accessible to people, regardless of age, disability, or other factors. It emerged as a rights-based, anti-discrimination measure, which seeks to create design for all abilities. Evaluating material and structures that can be utilized by all. It addresses common barriers to participation by creating things that can be used by the maximum number of people possible. “When disabling mechanisms are to be replaced with mechanisms for inclusion, different kinds of knowledge are relevant for different purposes. As a practical strategy for inclusion, Universal Design involves dilemmas and often difficult priorities.” Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, which are essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example of universal design.

== History ==
The term &quot;universal design&quot; was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, due to some people having unusual or conflicting access needs, such as a person with low vision needing bright light and a person with photophobia needing dim light, universal design does not address absolutely every need for every person in every situation.

Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier-free concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments. Several different fields, such as engineering, architecture, and medicine collaborate in order to effectively create accessible environments that can lend to inclusion for a variety of disabilities. It can change the socio-material relationships people have with spaces and environments and create positive experiences for all kinds of abilities. Which allows for meaningful participation across multiple demographics experiencing disability.

=== Barrier-free design ===
In 1960, specifications for barrier-free design were published as a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research. In 1961, the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) A1171.1 specifications were published as the first Barrier Free Design standard. It presented criteria for designing facilities and programs for use by individuals with disabilities. The research started in 1949 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and continues to this day. The principal investigator, Dr. Timothy Nugent, who is credited in the 1961, 1971, and 1980 standards, also started the National Wheelchair Basketball Association. 

The ANSI A117.1 standard was adopted by the US federal government General Services Administration under the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) in 1984, then in 1990 for American with Disabilities Act (ADA). The archived research documents are at the International Code Council (ICC) - ANSI A117.1 division. Dr. Nugent made presentations around the globe in the late 1950s and 1960s presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design.

Another comprehensive publication by the Royal Institute of British Architects published three editions 1963, 1967, 1976 and 1997 of Designing for the Disabled by Selwyn Goldsmith UK. These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities. Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder.

Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers, engineers, non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities.

In October 2003, representatives from China, Japan, and South Korea met in Beijing and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.

=== Design for All ===
Selwyn Goldsmith, author of &quot;Designing for the Disabled&quot; (1963), pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb – now a standard feature of the built environment.

The term Design for All (DfA) is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation. &quot;Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality&quot; (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the European Commission, it &quot;encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the elderly and people with disabilities, as much as the teenage techno wizard.&quot; The origin of Design for All lies in the field of barrier-free accessibility for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design.

Design for All has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in Europe. Design for All is about ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances.

Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition. It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market. Easy-to-use, accessible, affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens. Design for All permits access to the built environment, access to services and user-friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons. Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market. This is best achieved by identifying and involving users (&quot;stakeholders&quot;) in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design (for All) in a wide range of socio-economic situations

==== In information and communication technology (ICT) ====
Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the Information society. The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility. A three-way approach is proposed: goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or, failing that, products being easy to adapt according to different needs, or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology. To this end, manufacturers and service providers, especially, but not exclusively, in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), produce new technologies, products, services and applications for everyone.

==== European organizational networks ====
In Europe, people have joined in networks to promote and develop Design for All:

*The European Design for All eAccessibility Network (EDeAN) was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in 2002. It fosters Design for All for eInclusion, that is, creating an information society for all. It has national contact centres (NCCs) in almost all EU countries and more than 160 network members in national networks.
*EIDD - Design for All Europe is a NGO and a 100% self-financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD), to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2016) has 31 member organizations in 20 European countries.
* EuCAN - The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in 1984 as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach. The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work. In 1999 the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre (better known by its acronym “Info-Handicap”) took over the coordination of the steering group, together with the implicit responsibility for the follow-up of the European Concept for Accessibility (ECA). The EuCAN publications - like ECA - aim to provide practical guidance. They are neither academic nor policy documents.

==Principles and goals==
The Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University expounded the following principles:

# Equitable use
# Flexibility in use
# Simple and intuitive
# Perceptible information
# Tolerance for error
# Low physical effort
# Size and space for approach and use

Each principle is broader than those of accessible design or barrier-free design contains and few brief guidelines that can be applied to design processes in any realm: physical or digital.

=== Goals ===
In 2012, the Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at the University at Buffalo expanded the definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness. Rooted in evidence based design, the 8 goals of universal design were also developed.

# Body Fit
# Comfort
# Awareness
# Understanding
# Wellness
# Social Integration
# Personalization
# Cultural Appropriateness

The first four goals are oriented to human performance: anthropometry, biomechanics, perception, cognition. Wellness bridges human performance and social participation. The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes. The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook &quot;Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments.&quot;

==The &quot;barrier-free&quot; concept==
 building modification consists of modifying buildings or facilities so that they can be used by people who are disabled or have physical impairments. The term is used primarily in Japan and other non-English speaking countries (e.g. German: &quot;Barrierefreiheit&quot;; Finnish: &quot;esteettömyys&quot;), while in English-speaking countries, terms such as &quot;accessibility&quot; and &quot;accessible&quot; dominate in everyday use. An example of barrier-free design would be installing a ramp for wheelchair users alongside steps. In the late 1990s, any element which could make the use of the environment inconvenient for people with disabilities was (and still is) considered a barrier, for example, poor public street lighting. In the case of new buildings, however, the idea of barrier-free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design, which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access.

Freeing a building of barriers means:
* Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people,
* Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairment and disability,
* Reviewing everything - from structure to smallest detail,
* Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes.

&quot;Barrier-free&quot; is also a term that applies to accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 applies. The process of adapting barrier-free public policies started when the Veterans Administration and US President&#x27;s Committee on Employment of the Handicapped noticed a large amount of US citizens coming back from the Vietnam War injured and unable to navigate public spaces.The ADA is a law focusing on all building aspects, products and design that is based on the concept of respecting human rights. It doesn&#x27;t contain design specifications directly.

An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier-free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore. Within five years, all public housing estates in the country, all 7,800 blocks of apartments, have benefited from the program.

==Barrier-free design examples==
The types of Universal Design elements vary dependent on the targeted population and the space. For example, in public spaces, universal design elements are often broad areas of accessibility while in private spaces, design elements address the specific requirements of the resident. Examples of these design elements are varied and leverage different approaches for different effects. Some examples include:

=== Communication ===

*Bright and appropriate lighting, particularly task lighting
* Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays
* Visual output redundant with information in auditory output
* Contrast controls on visual output
* Use of meaningful icons with text labels
* Clear lines of sight to reduce dependence on sound
* Volume controls on auditory output
* Speed controls on auditory output
* Choice of language on speech output
* Signs with light-on-dark visual contrast
* Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images
* Instruction that presents material both orally and visually
* Labels in large print on equipment control buttons
* Audio description, closed captioning

=== Access and mobility ===

*Public transit systems with low-floor buses that &quot;kneel&quot; (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts.
*Smooth, ground level entrances without stairs
* Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level, less than 5 pounds force per 120 pounds rolling force
* Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant per ASTM 2047
* Wide interior doors (3&#x27;0&quot;), hallways, and alcoves with 60&quot; × 60&quot; turning space at doors and dead-ends
* Functional clearances for approach and use of elements and components
* Ramp access in swimming pools

=== Ease of use ===

*Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs
* Single-hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations
* Components that do not require tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist
* Components that require less than 5 pounds of force to operate
* Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches
* Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch
* &quot;Gesture movements&quot; enabled spaces that may one help control temperature, lighting, social atmosphere, and other sensory qualities of an environment.

== Common shortcomings ==

=== Aswan case study ===
One study conducted in Aswan, Egypt published in the Journal of Engineering and Applied Science aimed to explore the accessibility in three administrative buildings in the area. They were looking for universal design in entrances and exits, circulation of traffic within the building, and wayfinding within the building&#x27;s services. They decided to focus their case study on administrative buildings in order to exemplify universal design that granted access for all citizens to all locations. Among the buildings, there were some shared issues. The researchers found that vertical movement was difficult for disabled patrons, given that there were no elevators. There was also no dropped curb, no Braille system, and the handles of doors were difficult to open, and there were no sensory indicators such as sounds or visual signs.

This case highlights the importance if demographics when considering needs for universal design. Over 60% of the citizens who use this building on a daily basis are elderly, but there aren&#x27;t accommodations that are helpful to their capabilities. Along with the lack of tactile features to guide the visually impaired, the space within the building is very congested, especially for one who may not have full physical capabilities and must use a wheelchair. The circulation suffers as a result, as well as the wayfinding in the structure.

=== Latin America ===

==== Guadalajara ====
Although there have been attempts to create more accessible public and outdoor spaces, the restorations made have ultimately failed to meet the needs of the disabled and elderly.

<text>The Akureyri Junior College ( , regionally also ; ) is an Icelandic gymnasium (academic secondary school). It is one of the oldest educational institutions in Iceland.

The Menntaskólinn á Akureyri traces its roots to the ancient school in Hólar in Hjaltadalur valley, founded in the beginning of Jón Ögmundsson&#x27;s episcopacy in 1130. Operation of that school was discontinued in 1802 but a campaign to reopen the school of the &#x27;Northland&#x27; was soon launched. Success came in 1880 when a &#x27;learned school&#x27; was opened at Möðruvellir in the valley of Hörgárdalur. The building in Möðruvellir burnt down in 1902 and the school was moved to Akureyri, where it is currently located.

Today the Junior College is attended by about 700 pupils every year, and on the national day of Iceland, 17 June, approximately 120 students graduate yearly. The Junior College&#x27;s headmaster is Jón Már Héðinsson. Tryggvi Gíslason (born 11 June 1938) was headmaster of Akureyri Junior College from 1973 to 2003. Tryggvi graduated with a mag. art. degree and taught Icelandic at the University of Bergen in Norway.

The college is based on tradition. A few of these are:
* Singing: A few times each semester, students gather outside the headmaster&#x27;s office to sing for him. If they sing well enough, he grants the students permission to skip the next class and gather in the auditorium to sing. ()
* No alcohol: All gatherings in the name of the school are alcohol free. Almost all students respect this and consider it something that distinguishes their school from others in Iceland.
* Different school year: As in other schools in Iceland this one has two terms, an autumn term and a spring term; but this school has its autumn exams after Christmas, while most other schools have the exams before Christmas.

==Notable faculty members==
* Björgvin Guðmundsson, composer
* Páll Skúlason, philosopher
* Steingrímur J. Sigfússon, politician
* Tómas Ingi Olrich, later member of Alþingi, Minister of Education, and ambassador to France
* Tryggvi Gíslason, headmaster from 1973 to 2003

<text>Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, located at 3601 Burt Street in the Midtown area of Omaha, Nebraska, United States, is a Catholic, college-preparatory high school for girls run by the Religious of the Sacred Heart. The institution previously included a college which was operated from 1908 to 1968. Today Duchesne is home to the high school and a co-ed preschool. While it is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha, it is an independent institution.

Rooted in Sacred Heart values, Duchesne Academy educates young women to be active participants in their own development. In 2020, Duchesne received the US Department of Education Green Ribbon for their efforts in sustainability and a Blue Ribbon Award for Academic Excellence.

==History==
Duchesne Academy was established in Omaha in 1881 and is named in honor of St. Rose Philippine Duchesne, one of the first women to join the Society of the Sacred Heart. St. Rose Philippine came to the United States from France in the early 19th century and established the first Sacred Heart school in St. Charles, Missouri. Duchesne is one of 24 schools in the Sacred Heart Network in the United States.

Duchesne enrolls approximately 85 students in each class, for a total of 340 in the school.

Duchesne has developed a nationally prominent mock trial program, winning the national championship in 2015 in the National High School Mock Trial Championship, held in Raleigh, North Carolina.

==Sacred Heart values==
Duchesne Academy, a member of an international network of schools operated by the Society of the Sacred Heart, is an independent Catholic girls’ school in Omaha, Nebraska. Duchesne offers a unique education focusing on commitment to: faith in God, academic excellence, development of social responsibility, formation of an inclusive community and personal dignity. This education reflects the values given priority by St. Madeleine Sophie Barat, foundress of the Society of the Sacred Heart.

Sharing in the Society&#x27;s mission to reveal God&#x27;s love in the heart of the world, Schools of the Sacred Heart commit to educate to:

# A personal and active faith in God
# A deep respect for intellectual values
# A social awareness that impels to action
# The building of community as a Christian value
# Personal growth in an atmosphere of wise freedom

==Traditions==
Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart is proud of its long, storied history which includes many beloved traditions rooted in its French heritage. These traditions are an integral part of the Sacred Heart experience for students and parents alike.

=== Congé ===
Congé (pronounced “con-jay”) means “holiday” in French. Student Congé is a surprise day that is announced once a year. Following the announcement of Congé classes are cancelled and the students focus on building community through fun activities and games.

=== Goûter ===
This word means “to taste” in French, and is more recognizable to Duchesne students as &quot;surprise snack&quot;.

=== Mater Ceremony ===
Duchesne gathers in October to celebrate the feast of Mater Admirabilis. At this prayer service, sophomores honor one woman (over the age of 21) who demonstrates a characteristic of Mary. Each girl and her mentor are called by name to the front of the chapel where the sophomore receives her Mater medal from her chosen “Mary” figure.

=== May Crowning ===
This prayer service is held at the beginning of May as a tribute to Our Lady. Class representatives are chosen to honor Mary with student reflections and the senior representative crowns her with a wreath of flowers.

=== Prize Day ===
Prize Day, a 200-year old tradition that began in the earliest Sacred Heart schools, continues today as a ceremony on the morning of the last day of the school year. It is the formal close to the school year and is held in the chapel. Following an all-school Mass, students receive prizes, distinctions, and recognitions for their academic accomplishments. Each student receives a completion of the year certificate and a wreath of flowers from the Head of School. At the conclusion of Prize Day, they return their crowns to the altar in thanksgiving for the gifts that God has given them.

=== Ring Ceremony ===
In the spring, seniors present the juniors with their Sacred Heart rings. During this ceremony, each junior is called by name to the front of the chapel where seniors present her with her ring.  After each junior is presented with her ring, the seniors turn their rings to face outward. This is symbolic of their imminent departure from Duchesne, and their responsibility to spread the love of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to the world outside of school.

==Academics==
Duchesne educates young women to be active participants in their own development. The Academy is fully accredited by North Central Accreditation, AdvancED, and the state of Nebraska. Traditionally, 100% of the Academy’s graduates attend four-year colleges and universities. Core subjects are studied in depth through a college-preparatory curriculum. Students begin researching, writing, testing, and analyzing from the start. Writing and critical thinking are emphasized in every classroom.

Devoted teachers guide each student’s growth in classrooms with a 9:1 student-to-teacher ratio. Teachers are approachable, always willing to help, and committed to providing personal attention.

==Sustainability==
Duchesne Academy received national recognition in 2020 as US Department of Education Green Ribbon School. The school’s sustainability efforts took root in the 2016-2017 academic year following the May 2015 release of “Laudato Si’,” Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment and human ecology. At Duchesne, sustainability is not just an academic concept, but rather a community-wide commitment to improving the school and the broader world in which we live. As a Sacred Heart school guided by the “Goals and Criteria” of Sacred Heart Education, our charism calls “all members of the school community [to] accept accountability for the care of God’s creation, practice effective stewardship of the earth’s resources and work to alleviate the climate crisis” (Goal III, Criterion 4).

<doc id="1158093" wikidata="Q5473856" url="?curid=1158093" title="Fosters, Ohio">
<text>Fosters (sometimes given as Foster) is an unincorporated community in southern Warren County, Ohio, United States. It straddles the Little Miami River in Deerfield and Hamilton Townships. It is located about two miles southwest of Hopkinsville, two miles west of Maineville, and two miles northeast of Twenty Mile Stand just off U.S. Route 22/State Route 3, the 3C Highway. (In the 1930s, the State of Ohio erected a new high bridge over the river that bypassed the community.) The community is in the Kings Local School District and is served by the Maineville post office. The settlement was originally called &quot;Foster&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. The community was named after the local Foster family.

The Little Miami Bike Trail, which runs from Milford to Spring Valley, runs through the community on the eastern shore of the Little Miami River.

==Arts and culture==
The Monkey Bar and Grille, also known as the Train Stop Inn, is located on the east side of the Little Miami River and was once a three-story hotel called The Blue Danube. It stood next to the Little Miami Railroad, which is now a bike trail. The hotel was located at Foster&#x27;s train stop and covered bridge. Train passengers traveled north and south while horse and wagons passed east and west, hence the reason &quot;Foster&#x27;s Crossing&quot; got its name.
Years later, around 1975, the hotel became a tavern and a local favorite &quot;watering hole&quot; which featured a cigarette-smoking, beer-drinking chimp named Sam.

Fosters Earthworks (private property) is
located on a wooded hilltop site on the west side of the river across from the Monkey Bar and Grille.
In 1890, archaeologist Frederick Ward Putnam investigated here. He called it “a singular ancient work” of the Hopewell culture, because he found that the walls were loaded with heavily burned stone, earth, and clay. Evidence collected from this site post dates earthworks at Fort Ancient located twelve miles up river.

<doc id="1158094" wikidata="Q7179955" url="?curid=1158094" title="Eldredgeops rana">
<text>Eldredgeops rana (formerly Phacops rana) is a species of trilobite from the middle Devonian period. Their fossils are found chiefly in the northeastern United States, and southwestern Ontario.

Because of its abundance and popularity with collectors, &quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; was designated the Pennsylvania state fossil by the state&#x27;s General Assembly on December 5, 1988.

== Description ==
&quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; can be recognized by its large eyes (which remind some observers of a frog&#x27;s eyes—the specific name &quot;rana&quot; is a reference to a common frog), its fairly large size (up to 6 inches long), and its habit of rolling up into a ball like a pill bug (&quot;volvation&quot;). In order to protect themselves from predators, &quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; would roll into a ball with its hard exoskeleton on the outside as protection. Many other trilobites possessed the same ability, but &quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; nearly perfected it. The slightest amount of sediment would trigger their senses, and &quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; would be hidden in a tiny shelter made of its own body. Although this safety feature often helped them to evade predators, occasionally it backfired and the trilobite would be buried under heavy sediment. Their fossils can still be found in balled-up positions 400 million years later.

== Fossilisation ==
&quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; is found in the northeastern U.S, southwestern Ontario, and in Morocco; North America was attached to the African Plate during the Devonian.

== Phacopid eyes ==
The most striking feature of the morphology of &quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; and its relatives is their eyes. These differed from the eyes of most trilobites in having comparatively few lenses spaced between deep sclera. The lenses themselves were very rounded instead of largely flat. The eyes were mounted on turret-like structures which could swivel, providing the animal with an almost 360-degree field of view. This type of eye is known as the schizochroal eye.

<doc id="1158095" wikidata="Q20793" url="?curid=1158095" title="European Shorthair">
<text>The European Shorthair, also known as the European and Celtic/European Shorthair, is a pedigreed cat breed. The breed&#x27;s name has also been used to describe the landrace domestic cat of Europe, causing confusion as the pedigreed cats of this breed also should resemble the typical domestic cats of Europe.

The role as the cat breed resembling the original domestic cats of Europe was held until the beginning of the 20th century by the British Shorthair, even though stockier than the majority of common European cats, until 1949 when the European Shorthair was recognized by the Fédération internationale féline (FIFe). The oldest known European Shorthair registered in FIFe was born in 1940.

==History==
===Origin===

European Shorthair has its counterparts in Great Britain (British Shorthair) and the U.S. (American Shorthair), though these breeds have been bred for longer.
The British Shorthair, however, was crossed with the Persian and selectively bred to become a cobbier cat with a slightly shortened muzzle and thicker coat.
It was confusing for Scandinavian breeders that the British Shorthair was also called European Shorthair at that time, even though it looked different. Felinological associations recognized both types of cat as a single breed, meaning they were judged by the same standards during cat shows, until 1982 when FIFE registered the Scandinavian type of European Shorthair as a separate breed with its own standard.

===Breed recognition===
As of 2023, the European (Shorthair) cat breed is recognised by ACF, FIFe, LOOF, TICA (registration only), and WCF.

==Appearance==

The breed resembles a domestic shorthair and is of medium size with a muscular body. The face is well rounded with well developed cheekbones. The ears are of medium size and slightly rounded at the tip. Eyes are round and open. The eye can be any colour including odd eyed. The neck is of medium length and muscular. The tail is of medium length, thick at the base with a rounded tip.


===Coat===
The European Shorthair&#x27;s coat is short, dense, and glossy.

====Coat Colour====
All natural colours are permitted, such as black, red, blue and cream, with or without tabby, tortoiseshell, silver or white markings, though the combination of tabby with white and smoke with white is not allowed in FIFe. Solid white is also permitted. The eye colour corresponds to the coat colour and may be yellow, green or orange. Blue or odd-eyed individuals are permitted if the coat colour is white.

==Health==
In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the US the European Shorthair had the highest rate of the condition with 53 cats having the condition out of a population of 78.

==Temperament==

The breed has developed from the natural mouse hunters of Europe with the wish to strengthen the most desirable personality traits of the domestic cats. Most European Shorthairs are strong and active, and as a rule they are friendly towards people of all ages. They get on well with other cats and tolerate dogs well. European Shorthairs are intelligent and playful, and most of them are expert at keeping houses and gardens free of all types of rodents. They tend to handle changes and an active home very well, making them suitable for families with children.

==Popularity==
The breed is mostly popular in Scandinavia but also in Germany, as there are still huge populations of similar-looking cats in Europe, and the European Shorthairs are for those appreciating a supple breed which has had a selection for a good temper. The European Shorthair is on the list of endangered breeds in Sweden and is the national cat of Finland.

<text>Minnesota Glacier () is a broad glacier, about long and wide, flowing east through the Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica, separating the Sentinel Range and the Heritage Range. It is nourished by ice from the plateau west of the mountains and by Nimitz Glacier and Splettstoesser Glacier, and merges into the larger Rutford Ice Stream at the eastern margin of the Ellsworth Mountains.

The glacier was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, which sent research parties to the Ellsworth Mountains in 1961–62, 1962–63 and 1963–64.

<text>The Launceston Steam Railway is a narrow gauge railway, in Cornwall, England. The railway operates from the town of Launceston to Newmills, where there is a farm park; it is long. The railway is built on the trackbed of the former standard gauge North Cornwall Railway.

==History==

===Standard gauge railway===
The first railway to reach Launceston was the Launceston and South Devon Railway, opened in 1865 from Launceston to Plymouth, and later absorbed into the Great Western Railway. In 1886 the London and South Western Railway opened its railway from Halwill Junction, extended to Padstow in stages in the 1890s, and later part of the Southern Railway. The two Launceston stations were side by side: the Great Western closed in 1962 and the Southern in 1966.

===Narrow gauge revival===
In 1965, Nigel Bowman, a trainee teacher, rescued the steam locomotive &quot;Lilian&quot; from the Penrhyn Slate Quarry in North Wales, and restored her to working order at his home in Surrey. He then set about looking for a site to build a railway for &quot;Lilian&quot; to run on, and settled on Launceston in 1971, after considering a stretch of trackbed from Guildford to Horsham and the Lynton &amp; Barnstaple Railway. Purchase of the trackbed took several years, and the first of track opened on Boxing Day 1983. Permission to operate the railway was granted by The Launceston Light Railway Order 1982. The railway was extended progressively, the latest opening to Newmills in 1995 bringing the line to its current length.
==Route==
The LSR starts at a new station just west of the original LSWR station, which is now an industrial estate. Launceston station is the main station on the railway, and the sheds and engineering facilities are located here. The line runs from the station through a cutting, passing under a road bridge and aqueduct carrying a mill leat, before crossing the River Kensey on a two-arch viaduct. The line is now on an embankment and crosses a bridge over a farm track before arriving at Hunt&#x27;s Crossing, where it is planned to lay a passing loop. After Hunt&#x27;s Crossing the line crosses two farm crossings and then reaches Canna Park which was the temporary terminus before the extension to Newmills. From Canna Park there is a fairly short run to Newmills, the terminus. Adjacent to the Newmills station is the Newmills Farm Park.

==Locomotives==
All public train services are operated by the steam locomotives, whilst the internal combustion locomotives are used for maintenance work.

===Steam locomotives===
===Internal combustion and battery electric===
===Visiting locomotives===
==Rolling stock==
The railway has four passenger carriages, all built on site and based on those built for the Manx Electric Railway, Torrington and Marland Railway and the Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway. There are also several ex. Royal Naval Armaments Depot box vans, slate wagons and tipping wagons.

<text>Grumbles from the Grave is a posthumous 1989 autobiographical work by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, collated by his wife Virginia Heinlein from his notes and writings. The work is the closest that Heinlein came to writing an autobiography. It contains a wide range of correspondence, notes and memoirs, and was published a year and a half after his death.

==Contents==
&quot;Grumbles from the Grave&quot; provides insight into Heinlein&#x27;s writing process (and the editorial/publishing process with which he was often at odds). In addition, it contains evidence of his philosophy as applied to his life and personal opinions. Beginning with a short biography of Robert by Virginia, the bulk of the book consists of excerpts of correspondence from the period from 1939 to 1970, from when he began writing science fiction until the onset of his first major illness. There is considerable information provided into how the 13-year gestation of Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; evolved. Additionally there is the original postlude to &quot;Podkayne of Mars&quot; and a discussion of cuts made to his novel &quot;Red Planet&quot;.

==Criticisms==
Frederik Pohl has complained &quot;Robert had talked about allowing posthumous publication of his real feelings about a lot of things that he didn’t feel comfortable to talk about while he was alive, and indicated that some of his private letters would be a source for the book. Then some posthumous book with that title did come out, and it was a great disappointment. Someone — it could have been only [Virginia Heinlein] — had washed his face and combed his hair and turned whatever it was that Robert might have wanted to say into the equivalent of thank-you notes for a respectable English tea. I know that Robert wrote some much more raunchy letters than any of those, because I myself got one or two. But all the raunch has been edited out. What’s left is actually rather boring and does a great disservice to the real Heinlein, whose physical person may have been embodied as a conventional hard-right conservative but whose writing was — sometimes vulgarly — that of a free-thinking iconoclast&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
The book was a finalist for the 1990 Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book.

<text>Juho Niukkanen (27 July 1888 in Kirvu – 17 May 1954 in Helsinki) was a Finnish politician prior to, during, and after the Winter War. He was a member of parliament from 1916 to 1933 and again from 1936 to 1954, and represented the Agrarian Party (&quot;Maalaisliitto&quot;). He served as a minister in many cabinets. His most important office was as Minister of Finance on three occasions, and as Minister of Defence from 1937 to 1940.

Juho Niukkanen was a favourite subject of many puns and jokes, because his name is derived from the adjective &quot;niukka&quot; (bare, meagre, economical).

<text>Twenty Mile Stand is an unincorporated community in southeastern Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio, United States. It lies on the old 3C Highway in Town 4 East, Range 2 North, Section 21 of the Symmes Purchase and in the center of the area known as &quot;Landen&quot;. It is about three miles south-south west of Kings Mills, two miles southwest of Fosters, and twenty miles northeast of Cincinnati.

A post office called Twenty Mile Stand was established in 1819, the name was changed to Twentymile Stand in 1895, and the post office closed in 1904. In the 19th century, the town was a stagecoach stop from downtown Cincinnati, hence the name. In April 2013, the original stagecoach stop, known as the Twenty Mile House, was demolished and replaced with a modern strip mall and gas station. The house had been a fine and casual restaurant, bar and tavern for generations.
