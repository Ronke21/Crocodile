<text>Malayer () is a city in the Central District of Malayer County, Hamadan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

Malayer is the second largest city in the province, and is famous for furniture. The city has many parks, the biggest historical park of which is Seyfieh Park. Malayer is located between the two cities of Hamedan and Arak, both of which are the centers of the province. Malayer is the national city of furniture and inlays and the world city of grapes.

==History==
Malayer, a city in western Iran, has a rich history dating back to ancient and pre-Islamic times. Originally known as Dowlatabad, it was renamed Malayer in the early 20th century, marking a shift in administrative and cultural significance. The city gained prominence during the Seljuk and Safavid dynasties as a key center for rug production. Its strategic location along historic trade routes contributed to its cultural diversity, reflected in the variety of designs found in Malayer rugs. Additionally, Malayer has been notable for its craftsmanship, particularly in rug-weaving and woodworking traditions.

During the 1917-1919 famine, Malayer, like many other regions in Iran, experienced severe food shortages and hardship. The community faced challenges in sustaining local resources, significantly affecting the population.

In World War II, Malayer was under British control as part of the broader Allied occupation in Iran. This occupation impacted local agriculture and resources, contributing to the economic and social conditions of the time.

==Demographics==
=== Dialect ===
The people of Malayer speak a variety of Persian known as the Malayeri dialect. This dialect includes unique vocabulary and phonetic features that distinguish it from standard Persian. It reflects influences from the surrounding regions, incorporating elements from both Kurdish and Lori languages, contributing to its distinctiveness within the Hamadan province.

<text>This is a list of the number one hits in the [[UK Albums Chart]], from its inception in 1956 to the present. The sources are the &quot;Record Mirror&quot; chart from 1956 to the end of 1958, the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; chart from November 1958 to March 1960, the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart from March 1960 to March 1972 and the &quot;Music Week&quot; chart from then onwards.

The first number one album was Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers!&quot;. For its first few years the chart was usually topped by a musical soundtrack or original cast recording, but rock albums steadily gained ground. Rock was dominant after the release of The Beatles first LP, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, in 1963, except for the two-and-a-half-year spell later in the 1960s when the soundtrack of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; went to the top of the charts repeatedly. As of the week ending 1 December 2013, Robbie Williams&#x27; tenth studio album &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot; became the 1,000th album to become number 1.

==Records==
The original soundtrack of &quot;South Pacific&quot; holds the record for the most weeks at Number 1, with a cumulative total of 115 weeks, including one stretch of 70 consecutive weeks. A fairly distant second place is held by &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; soundtrack with a cumulative total of 70 weeks. Third is &quot;The King and I&quot; soundtrack with a cumulative total of 48 weeks. Fourth is the highest non soundtrack &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel with a cumulative total of 33 weeks.

The second longest consecutive streak is held by The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, which spent 30 weeks at the top before being knocked off by the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, which was itself at the summit for 21 weeks. This means The Beatles were at number one for 51 consecutive weeks in all - a total not bettered by any other artist.

<doc id="1170351" wikidata="Q2907992" url="?curid=1170351" title="Bobby Orlando">
<text>Robert Philip Orlando also known as Bobby Orlando or just Bobby O, is an American record producer, indie record label owner, songwriter, and musician. He is regarded as an innovator in the hi-NRG genre for developing his signature sound, using a &quot;powerful beat&quot; and &quot;new wave-style&quot; vocals with the help of synthesizers, piano, guitars, cowbells and a &quot;heavy [synthesizer] bass&quot;.

== Early life ==
The son of a suburban New York schoolteacher, Orlando declined a classical music scholarship to pursue his then current musical interest, glam rock. In the late 1970s, his professional interests turned to disco and shortly thereafter, he established his own record label, &quot;O&quot; Records.

==Music career==
Bobby Orlando has been active as music producer, songwriter, musician, and record label impresario.

Orlando is credited as one of the founding fathers of Hi-NRG dance music. His productions are easily identifiable by their dense synthesizers, rolling bass lines, and resounding percussion. He has played multiple instruments on his tracks including electronic keyboards, guitars, bass, synthesizers, drums, piano, assorted percussion, trumpet and saxophone. The ringing cowbell percussion lines and robotic sequencers heard in &quot;She Has a Way&quot;, &quot;The Best Part of Breakin&#x27; Up&quot; and &quot;Native Love (Step by Step)&quot; have been described as defining his trademark sound.

As a solo artist, Bobby O scored hits with tracks &quot;She Has a Way&quot;, &quot;How to Pick Up Girls&quot;, &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m So Hot for You&quot;. He created his project concept The Flirts, to further front his performances as an artist, musician and songwriter. With an ever revolving roster of female session singers and models, Orlando churned out the hits &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, and &quot;Helpless&quot;. His association with underground film star Divine resulted in classic club anthems &quot;Native Love (Step by Step)&quot; (featuring Orlando&#x27;s voice in the chorus), &quot;Love Reaction&quot;, and &quot;Shoot Your Shot&quot;. Orlando also produced The Fast, later to be known as Man 2 Man.

When Neil Tennant, then an assistant editor at &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, and later a member of Pet Shop Boys, was sent to interview the Police in 1983 in New York, he sought out Orlando. Both Tennant and fellow Pet Shop Boy Chris Lowe admired Orlando&#x27;s sound and productions – &quot;Passion&quot; by the Flirts, being a particular favorite. Orlando decided to produce a Pet Shop Boys album and released their first two earliest 12-inch singles including the original 1984 version of &quot;West End Girls&quot; and &quot;One More Chance&quot;. Orlando and the Pet Shop Boys recorded twelve tracks together, most of which never saw release, including the original versions of &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;, and &quot;I Get Excited&quot;. 

Orlando&#x27;s songs frequently deal with philosophical themes such as &quot;Try It (I&#x27;m in Love with a Married Man)&quot;, which was given a contemporary twist when it was re-recorded by Pet Shop Boys in 2003 (see &quot;Disco 3&quot;). Many of Orlando&#x27;s lyrics describe unrequited love, private despair, personal angst and a truth-seeking perspective. Orlando frequently etched philosophical maxims into vinyl records featuring his songs; these adages being literally cut into the grooves near the &quot;lead out&quot; and &quot;lock grooves&quot; of the vinyl.

His music has appeared in numerous motion pictures, including &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot;, &quot;High Risk&quot;, &quot;Rappin&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;,&#x27;This Is The Night&quot; and Eric.

French electroclash duo Miss Kittin &amp; the Hacker mention Orlando in their song &quot;Walking in the Sunshine&quot; from their 2001 release, &quot;First Album&quot; (&quot;I love men like Bobby Orlando / The Flirts composer a long time ago / It makes me laugh a lot, you know / But I don&#x27;t want to show&quot;).

Orlando has influenced various Eurodisco, tropical house, techno, Italo disco, electronic dance music (&quot;EDM&quot;) and hi-NRG releases. He has been cited by music historians for his contribution to dance music.

<doc id="1170356" wikidata="Q5763447" url="?curid=1170356" title="Hills District, New South Wales">
<text>The Hills District (alternatively the Hills) is a region of Sydney, within the northern part of the Greater Western Sydney region of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. 

There are no formal or legal definitions of this district but a loose definition would be that it stretches from the M2 Hills Motorway in the south to the Hawkesbury River in the north and Old Windsor Road in the west to Pennant Hills Road and Berowra Creek in the east. 

The Hills District is a conservative and largely white collar region.

==Geography==

The region is named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau; and the Hawkesbury Plain lifting up and joining the same Hornsby Plateau. Several suburbs around this area have &#x27;Hills&#x27; in their names, such as Baulkham Hills, Beaumont Hills, Castle Hill, Rouse Hill, Box Hill and Winston Hills.

==History==

=== Aboriginal settlement ===
The Dharug People occupied the Hills and surrounding areas prior to European settlement. Rock dwellings found near the Darling Mills Creek are almost 12,000 years old. The Dharug would trade with adjacent clans like the Boorooberongal clan in the northwest. In 1789, a smallpox epidemic killed many of their numbers.

=== European settlement ===

==== Initial settlement ====
Governor Arthur Phillip surveyed the district in April 1791. His party was in search of a new area for settlement and farming to support a struggling colony in Sydney. In 1794, Hawkesbury Road, later Windsor Road, was built from the Toongabbie Government Farm to the Hawkesbury. In the same year, William Joyce, a pardoned convict, received the first land grant in the area, east of Hawkesbury Road, in what is now Baulkham Hills. He opened an inn on the same road. William Joyce Reserve is a reminder of his property.

==== Other early settlement ====

In 1799, Joseph Foveaux was granted 300 acres of land in what is now the Bella Vista area of Baulkham Hills. He sold this land to John Macarthur, and his wife, Elizabeth, the two of whom pioneered in wool manufacturing, and are attributed to starting Australia&#x27;s wool industry. Part of this land was later acquired by Matthew Pearce. His farm was called &#x27;Bella Vista Farm&#x27;. Foveaux Terrace, Elizabeth Macarthur Drive, and Macarthur Ridge Way, streets in Bella Vista; and Elizabeth Macarthur Creek starting in Kellyville are named after these early settlers. Matthew Pearce Public School, the largest in the state, is named after Matthew Pearce.

==== Government Farm in Castle Hill ====

Castle Hill Government Farm was established in 1801, and Castle Hill Heritage Park is built upon the land. It is third government farm in the country, built only twelve years after the historic grant of Experiment Farm to James Ruse. It was also a major site in the Battle of Vinegar Hill. Toongabbie Road, now Junction Road in Winston Hills, was built in the same year as the farm from Toongabbie to the junction in Baulkham Hills. Castle Hill Road was built from the junction to the farm in Castle Hill, and survives today as part of Old Northern Road and Old Castle Hill Road. The farm was turned into Australia&#x27;s first lunatic asylum in 1811, until it was closed in 1826, when it was relocated to Liverpool.

==== Battle of Vinegar Hill ====
The Battle of Vinegar Hill, or Castle Hill Convict Rebellion (sometimes referred to as the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill, so as not to be confused with a rebellion of the same name in Ireland) is the historic first convict rebellion in Australia, and the only one suppressed under martial law. Vinegar Hill is located in Rouse Hill, and the rebellion occurred on 4 March 1804. Over 200 convicts escaped from a prison farm with the intent to &quot;capture ships to sail to Ireland&quot;. Martial law was instated, and the rebels were hunted down until a truce was declared.

==== Windsor and Old Windsor Roads ====
Windsor and Old Windsor Roads are historic roads in Australia, as they are the second and third roads laid in the colony. They connect Parramatta with Windsor, but are majorly used as arterial roads for residents, especially in the Hills District. There are residential streets in Wentworthville and Westmead over the original alignment of Windsor Road. The original road started at Prospect Road, which is now the Great Western Highway. It went through the Government Farm at Toongabbie. It was widened in 1797 to 20 feet (approximately 6 metres). In 1802, Howe&#x27;s Bridge was constructed at the crossing of South Creek, Windsor. In 1805, James Meehan surveyed a new alignment of the road, from Parramatta to Kellyville. This was the basis of the new Windsor Road. Governrnor Lachlan Macquarie, as part of his Parramatta Town Plan, commissioned a new toll road, which would follow Church Street across the Parramatta River, then follow the line traced by Meehan to Kellyville. This is approximately the same route that today&#x27;s Windsor Road follows. This route was preferred, as it avoided many of the hills near Old Windsor Road, and the new Parramatta Government Domain, upon which Parramatta Park is built. New Windsor Road was completed in 1812, featuring 70 bridges, and was 32 feet wide (approximately 10 metres). In 1833, Windsor Road was declared a main road, maintained by public expenses. Old Windsor Road was also proclaimed a parish road. In 1835, Windsor Toll House was built, near South Creek. Bitumen for motor vehicles was laid in 1925. The upgrading for motor vehicles continued throughout the 1930s. The roads are now amongst the most well-serviced roads in the state by buses. The North-West Transit-way (NW T-way) runs along the entirety of Old Windsor Road, and along Windsor Road to Rouse Hill Town Centre.

== Population ==
According to the 2016 Census, The Hills Shire is home to 157,243 permanent residents. Of these, 50.7% were female and 49.3% were male. The exact number of residents in the Hills District would be hard to calculate as the Hills District refers to areas/suburbs in multiple LGAs.

== Environment &amp; Climate ==
As the name indicates, the Hills District is an area of high elevation above sea level (compared with the rest of the Sydney basin) and thus creates orographic rainfall brought in by onshore winds from the Pacific Ocean. This leaves the Hills District with slightly higher rainfall than the rest of Sydney and creates a rain shadow for some places in the Blacktown district, including Marayong and Doonside. This climate characteristic was well suited to orchard production of stone fruit and citrus which proved luxuriant on the deep rich soils.

Most of the suburbs in the Hills District borderline the oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) zone under the Köppen climate classification, as their warmest month mean may barely reach 22 °C (71.6 °F) in some years. Though they are still safely in the humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) zone.

== Religion ==
The area was previously known to have the highest rate of religious service attendance in Australia and was referred to as &quot;Sydney&#x27;s Bible Belt&quot;. The Hills District repeatedly showed higher than average religious affiliation in the Australian Census, and still retains a large Christian population that represents 64.8% of religious people in the area. Despite a high Christian population, the area no longer represents the most religious region of Sydney. In the 2016 Census the Hills Shire was reported to be the tenth most religious local government area in metropolitan Sydney with 21.2% people reporting no religion. 

The strong evangelical Christian tinge of the Hills District has made the region strongly conservative, a trend that runs right through local, state and Federal politics. The federal Division of Mitchell, which covers most of the area, is one of the safest seats in metropolitan Australia for the conservative Liberal Party of Australia, and all of the Hills District seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly are held by the NSW Liberals.

== Public transport ==
The Metro North West Line, opened in May 2019, has a frequency of every 4 minutes in the peak hour to Chatswood railway station, where passengers can change to other trains towards the city. This became a direct service to the Sydney CBD in August 2024 as part Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest.

An extensive number of bus routes operate in the district, operated by Busways and CDC NSW. The region is served by the North-West T-way, connecting the Hills District with Blacktown, Parramatta and Rouse Hill. 

The now closed Carlingford railway line, operated by Sydney Trains has been converted into light rail as part of the Parramatta Light Rail project.

<text>The Indonesian mountain weasel (Mustela lutreolina) is a species of weasel that lives on the islands of Java and Sumatra in Indonesia at elevations over . They live in mountainous, tropical, and rainforest areas. Indonesian mountain weasels have a body length of and a tail length of . They are reddish-brown in color.

The Indonesian mountain weasel is endangered due to hunting, fur trade, and habitat destruction. There are no recognized subspecies of the Indonesian mountain weasel.

==Food habits==
Indonesian mountain weasels are carnivorous, and are especially adapted to eating rodents. They are able to kill prey much larger than themselves due to their speed and agility.

<text>Olga Vladimirovna Baklanova (; 19 August 1893 – 6 September 1974), known professionally as Olga Baclanova, was a Russian-born actress who found success in Hollywood films, as well as stage roles in the US and the United Kingdom, she was mainly billed as an exotic blonde temptress, who was given the title of the &quot;Russian Tigress&quot;.

Baclanova spent her early years in her native land appearing in silent films from 1914 until 1918, reducing her age by several years and changing the spelling of her surname Baklanova. She was often billed under her surname only, similar to her fellow countrywoman Nazimova.

She emigrated to the United States in 1925, and started appearing on stage and subsequently in Hollywood films, where she was celebrated for the Universal Pictures silent &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; as the evil Duchess Josiana and in Tod Browning&#x27;s cult-classic horror film &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932) at MGM, as scheming circus trapeze artist, Cleopatra.

== Early life, Moscow Arts Theatre and Russian career (radio, stage and film) ==

Olga Vladimirovna Baklanova was born on 19 August 1893 (other sources state 1883, 1884, 1896 or even 1900, according to her obituary) in Moscow, Russia. She was the daughter of Vladimir Baklanov and his wife Alexandra, an actress in early Russian films. She had 6 siblings, including later Soviet general and World War II hero Gleb Baklanov. Baclanova studied drama at the Cherniavsky Institute before being accepted into the Moscow Art Theatre with contemporaries such as Maria Ouspenskaya in 1912.

Over the next decade she appeared in Russian films, and also performed extensively on stage, touring and performing in many countries of the world. She was a feature actress of plays by Ibsen, Chekhov and Turgenev, and the M.A.T productions of Shakespeare, Dickins and Berger.

In the 1930s, Baclanova, who had vocal training at the Moscow Arts Theatre, had a program called &quot;Olga Baclanova&#x27;s Continental Review&quot;, and she often appeared as a guest on radio programs singing songs in her native Russian, often with the F. Zarkerich Orchestra and also made recordings, including an album titled the &quot;Olga Baclanova Album&quot;, released in 1946, by Unique Records

In 1925 she was given the award &quot;Merited Artist of the Republic&quot;, the highest Soviet artist honour. Baclanova appeared in around 17 films during her career in Russia.

== American career ==

Baclanova came to New York City with the 1925 touring production of the Moscow Art Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Lysistrata&quot;. When the rest of the company returned to Russia the following year, she stayed in America. She appeared in a West Coast production of &quot;The Miracle&quot;, before being cast in a bit part in her debut film, &quot;The Dove&quot; in 1927. A statuesque blonde, Baclanova quickly established herself as a popular actress in American silent movies and achieved success with &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; in 1928, directed by Josef von Sternberg. Later that year, she appeared in &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; as Duchess Josiana, the &quot;femme fatale&quot; love interest to Conrad Veidt&#x27;s disfigured hero.

The introduction of talking films proved difficult for Baclanova due to her heavy Russian accent. She no longer secured leading roles, and was relegated to supporting parts. Her career was in decline when she was offered the role of the cruel circus performer Cleopatra in Tod Browning&#x27;s film &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932). This horror movie, which featured actual carnival freaks, was highly controversial and screened only briefly before being withdrawn. It would be 30 years before &quot;Freaks&quot; gained a cult following. The movie did not revive Baclanova&#x27;s film career, which ended in 1943.

Baclanova worked extensively on stage in London&#x27;s West End and in New York, for about 10 years starting in the mid-1930s. In 1943 she appeared in &quot;Claudia&quot; at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington.

== Personal life ==
Baclanova&#x27;s father died of natural causes in 1922. She was married three times. Her first husband was a lawyer named Vladimir Zoppi with whom she had her first son. Her second husband was actor Nicholas Soussanin with whom she had her second son. The birth of her second son was front-page news and was covered quite extensively in the press in 1930. Her third marriage was to Russian-born David Judovitch, better known as Richard Davis (1900–1984), who owned the Fine Arts Theatre in New York. In 1931, Baclanova became a naturalized American citizen.

== Legacy ==
Olga&#x27;s likeness to the American pop singer Madonna in the 1980s has been mentioned as particularly evident in &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;.

In Russia, Baclanova&#x27;s departure from the USSR made room for the success of Soviet movie star Lyubov Orlova, a struggling ex-pianist with a certain likeness to Olga. In 1926, Orlova was promoted from a choir after two months in a theatre, by the heart-broken Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, a rumored lover or admirer of Baclanova, his favorite student. Fashion historian Alexandre Vassiliev remembered in 2018: &quot;He [Vladimir] loved her [Olga] in letters, he was thinking deeply about her. The only time he cried [publicly], at the piano in the Art Theatre foyer, was when he had found out about Olga Vladimirovna Baclanova [emigration]... He really began to cry. I&#x27;m sure of this, not because I was there but because I was a friend of who was also closely connected to Nemirovich-Danchenko and could have known this from the wife of the famous director... Lyubov Orlova blossomed as Baclanova&#x27;s substitute.&quot;

== Later years ==
After her retirement she migrated to Switzerland. She died at a rest home on 6 September 1974 from lung cancer in Vevey, aged 81, and apparently had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, although this is unconfirmed. She was interred at Corsier cemetery, in Corsier-sur-Vevey.

<text>James Steven Abrahams (May 10, 1944 – November 26, 2024) was an American film director and writer, best known as a member of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.

==Life and career==
James Steven Abrahams was born on May 10, 1944, to a Jewish family in Shorewood, Wisconsin, the son of Louise M. (née Ogens), an educational researcher, and Norman S. Abrahams, a lawyer. He attended Shorewood High School. He had a home in Eagle River, Wisconsin, where he spent summers from the time he was a child.

He is best known for the spoof movies that he co-wrote and produced with brothers Jerry Zucker and David Zucker, such as &quot;Airplane!&quot; (for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay) and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; series. The team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker (also referred to as &quot;ZAZ&quot;) really began when the three men grew up together in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He directed movies on his own, such as &quot;Big Business&quot;, and further honed his skills in parody with &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; and its 1993 sequel, &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;. 

Abrahams and his wife, Nancy (née Cocuzzo) co-founded The Charlie Foundation To Help Cure Pediatric Epilepsy. He was an advocate of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.

Abrahams had three children. His daughter, Jamie Abrahams, is also a comedy writer. He died from leukemia at his home in Santa Monica, California, on November 26, 2024, at the age of 80. He had the disease for twenty years before his death and at one point was in remission until it returned.

<doc id="1170391" wikidata="Q7932345" url="?curid=1170391" title="Vindicated (song)">
<text>&quot;Vindicated&quot; is a song by American rock band Dashboard Confessional. It was written by Chris Carrabba with production from Don Gilmore and Gil Norton. The song was released on May 31, 2004 as the lead single from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The song was included on Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot; (2006) as a bonus track on some pressings and on deluxe edition versions. Played over the film&#x27;s end credits, &quot;Vindicated&quot; is the theme for the film.

Loudwire included the track on their list of The 12 Best Emo Power Ballads.

==Background==
Initially, a song titled &quot;I Need a Sure Thing&quot; was to be used on the &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; soundtrack; but, after having received a special screening of the film, Carrabba penned &quot;Vindicated&quot; in 10 minutes, inspired by and reflecting the theme of the film.

&quot;I Need a Sure Thing&quot; has since then been performed during the &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot; tour, but not thereafter.

==Reception==
&quot;Vindicated&quot; was released to radio on June 1, 2004. &quot;Vindicated&quot; received significant airplay on US alternative rock radio stations in late 2004, peaking at #2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart. It was held off from the #1 spot by Three Days Grace&#x27;s &quot;Just Like You&quot;.

==Track listing==
UK maxi single
#&quot;Vindicated&quot; – 3:20
#&quot;The Warmth of the Sand&quot; – 4:17
#&quot;Hands Down&quot; – 3:07
#:Track 3 taken from the &quot;So Impossible&quot; EP.

==Music video==
Directed by Nigel Dick, the music video, through the view of an individual reading a comic book, features the band performing the song in Doctor Octopus&#x27; hideout interspersed with scenes from the film.

<doc id="1170397" wikidata="Q1021880" url="?curid=1170397" title="Carnarvon, Western Australia">
<text>Carnarvon ( ) is a coastal town situated approximately north of Perth, in Western Australia. It lies at the mouth of the Gascoyne River on the Indian Ocean. The Shark Bay world heritage area lies to the south of the town and the Ningaloo Reef and the tourist town of Exmouth lie to the north. Mungullah Aboriginal Community was formerly in the town however it has moved east of the town.

Inland, Carnarvon has strong links with the town of Gascoyne Junction and the Burringurrah Community. At the 2021 census, Carnarvon had a population of 4,879.

== History ==
The Inggarda people are the traditional owners of the region around Carnarvon. Before European settlement the place now called Carnarvon, located at the mouth of the Gascoyne River, was known as which means &#x27;neck of water&#x27;. Indigenous Australians associating with the Carnarvon area typically associate as being Yamatji, traditionally speaking the Wajarri language.

The town was founded in 1883, initially as a port and supply centre for the surrounding region, and is the administrative centre for the Shire of Carnarvon. The town site was officially gazetted on 4 June 1891, named after Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, a past Secretary of State for the Colonies.

===Carnarvon Jetty===
The carnarvon Jetty was built in the late 1890s and had reached its maximum length in 1904. In 2021, it was destroyed by Cyclone Seroja.

===Carnarvon Tram===
Carnarvon has had three tramways.
* The first, shown on a Public Works Department map of 1884, ran from a landing site on the river, across Olivia Terrace to a shed on the other side of the roada very short tramway indeed. The trolley used on this tramway was supposed to be hand powered, using a lever attached to crank on two of the wheels. However, there is a reference to the use of wind-power.
* The second tramway, constructed between 1886 and 1887, ran west from Olivia Terrace in a straight line to the jetty, which was halfway between Mangrove Point and Conspicuous Clump. It was horse drawn.
* The third, and partially remaining, tramway was completed on 9 November 1900. It runs from the townsite, across Babbage Island to the deep-sea jetty. It was constructed with a rail gauge of . It was long. Due to the heavy loads of wool being carried on what was a very light railway, it was decided to convert the tramway to gauge in 1908–09. This tramway was worked with a steam locomotive. The tramway ceased operation in December 1965.
The &quot;Carnarvon Light Railway Association&quot; operated trains along restored tracks on the jetty; however, due to unsafe conditions the jetty was closed to the public. In 2021 it was destroyed by Cyclone Seroja.

=== Aerospace ===
From 1964 to 1965, 12 sounding rockets were launched from Carnarvon to a maximum altitude of .

During the 1960s, NASA set up a tracking station nearby to support the Gemini and Apollo space programs. The tracking station was closed in the mid-1970s. Only the foundations of the historical site remain. The site is adjacent to the OTC Satellite Earth Station Carnarvon.
===&quot;Korean Star&quot;===
On 20 May 1988, the bulk carrier ran aground in bad weather near Cape Cuvier, within the port limits of Carnarvon. Around of fuel oil were spilled into the ocean. Damage was limited to of remote beaches and coastline. The ship was not salvaged and left grounded; however, very little of the wreck remains to be seen.

==Economy==
Main economic activities of the Gascoyne region include:
* mining, at a salt mine on nearby Lake Macleod and at inland mines
* fishing (major focus is a prawn fishery)
* tourism
* agriculture, including cattle, goats, sheep and wool, and horticulture, the major industry of the area. A range of products are grown along the Gascoyne River, particularly bananas (mainly Cavendish bananas) and tomatoes, as well as grapefruit, mangoes and table grapes. Climatic advantages enable the growers to meet out of season demand both locally and in export markets.

Radio Australia had a shortwave relay station (built during the 1970s) that used to relay programming to Europe, South Asia and Southeast Asia. 

== Education ==
There are five schools in the town; one Catholic, three Western Australia Department of Education schools and one independent.

<doc id="1170407" wikidata="Q421219" url="?curid=1170407" title="Thioredoxin">
<text>Thioredoxin (TRX or TXN) is a class of small redox proteins known to be present in all organisms. It plays a role in many important biological processes, including redox signaling. In humans, thioredoxins are encoded by &quot;TXN&quot; and &quot;TXN2&quot; genes. Loss-of-function mutation of either of the two human thioredoxin genes is lethal at the four-cell stage of the developing embryo. Although not entirely understood, thioredoxin is linked to medicine through their response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). In plants, thioredoxins regulate a spectrum of critical functions, ranging from photosynthesis to growth, flowering and the development and germination of seeds. Thioredoxins play a role in cell-to-cell communication. 

==Occurrence==
They are found in nearly all known organisms and are essential for life in mammals. 

== Function ==
The primary function of thioredoxin (Trx) is the reduction of oxidized cysteine residues and the cleavage of disulfide bonds. Multiple in vitro substrates for thioredoxin have been identified, including ribonuclease, choriogonadotropins, coagulation factors, glucocorticoid receptor, and insulin. Reduction of insulin is classically used as an activity test. The thioredoxins are maintained in their reduced state by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase, in a NADPH-dependent reaction. Thioredoxins act as electron donors to peroxidases and ribonucleotide reductase. The related glutaredoxins share many of the functions of thioredoxins, but are reduced by glutathione rather than a specific reductase.

==Structure and mechanism==
Thioredoxin is a 12-kD oxidoreductase protein. Thioredoxin proteins also have a characteristic tertiary structure termed the thioredoxin fold. The active site contains a dithiols in a CXXC motif. These two cysteines are the key to the ability of thioredoxin to reduce other proteins. 

For Trx1, this process begins by attack of Cys32, one of the residues conserved in the thioredoxin CXXC motif, onto the oxidized group of the substrate. Almost immediately after this event Cys35, the other conserved Cys residue in Trx1, forms a disulfide bond with Cys32, thereby transferring 2 electrons to the substrate which is now in its reduced form. Oxidized Trx1 is then reduced by thioredoxin reductase, which in turn is reduced by NADPH as described above. 

Trx1 can regulate non-redox post-translational modifications. In the mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of Trx1, the proteomics study found that SET and MYND domain-containing protein 1 (SMYD1), a lysine methyltransferase highly expressed in cardiac and other muscle tissues, is also upregulated. This suggests that Trx1 may also play a role in protein methylation via regulating SMYD1 expression, which is independent of its oxidoreductase activity.

Plants have an unusually complex complement of Trx&#x27;s composed of six well-defined types (Trxs f, m, x, y, h, and o) that reside in diverse cell compartments and function in an array of processes. Thioredoxin proteins move from cell to cell, representing a novel form of cellular communication in plants.

== Interactions ==

Thioredoxin has been shown to interact with:
* ASK1, 
* Collagen, type I, alpha 1, 
* Glucocorticoid receptor, 
* SENP1,
* TXNIP.
* NF-κB – by reducing a disulfide bond in NF-κB, Trx1 promotes binding of this transcription factor to DNA.
* AP1 via Ref1 – Trx1 indirectly increases the DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1 (AP1) by reducing the DNA repair enzyme redox factor 1 (Ref-1), which in turn reduces AP1 in an example of a redox regulation cascade.
* AMPK – AMPK function in cardiomyocytes is preserved during oxidative stress due to an interaction between AMPK and Trx1. By forming a disulfide bridge between the two proteins, Trx1 prevents the formation and aggregation of oxidized AMPK, thereby allowing AMPK to function normally and participate in signaling cascades.

== Effect on cardiac hypertrophy ==
Trx1 has been shown to downregulate cardiac hypertrophy, the thickening of the walls of the lower heart chambers, by interactions with several different targets. Trx1 upregulates the transcriptional activity of nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF1 and NRF2) and stimulates the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α). Furthermore, Trx1 reduces two cysteine residues in histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), which allows HDAC4 to be imported from the cytosol, where the oxidized form resides, into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, reduced HDAC4 downregulates the activity of transcription factors such as NFAT that mediate cardiac hypertrophy. Trx 1 also controls microRNA levels in the heart and has been found to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by upregulating miR-98/let-7. Trx1 can regulate the expression level of SMYD1, thus may indirectly modulate protein methylation for purpose of cardiac protection.

== Thioredoxin in skin care ==
Thioredoxin is used in skin care products as an antioxidant in conjunction with glutaredoxin and glutathione.

== Thioredoxin-Like Proteins ==
NrdH from &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; is a distinctive thioredoxin-like protein, functionally similar to thioredoxins but with a sequence more akin to glutaredoxins. Unlike typical glutaredoxins, NrdH can accept electrons from thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) to drive ribonucleotide reduction, a critical step in DNA synthesis. Structural analysis reveals a thioredoxin fold with conserved redox motifs—CVQC and WSGFRP—that form a hydrogen-bond network and hydrophobic patch, stabilizing TrxR binding. This unique blend of glutaredoxin sequence features with thioredoxin activity underscores NrdH&#x27;s adaptive role in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;&#x27; redox regulation.

<text>The second USS &quot;Guerriere&quot; was a sloop-of-war in the United States Navy. She was named for the victory of the frigate over during the War of 1812.

&quot;Guerriere&quot; was launched on 9 September 1865 in the Boston Navy Yard and commissioned on 21 May 1867, Commander Thomas G. Corbin, in command. She sailed from New York on 28 June 1867 to serve as flagship of the South Atlantic Squadron protecting American commerce and interests along the coast of South America. She was relieved as flagship by on 17 June 1869 and sailed from Rio de Janeiro the 25th for the New York Navy Yard where she decommissioned on 29 July 1869.

&quot;Guerriere&quot; recommissioned at New York on 10 August 1870. At Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 27 September, she received the body of the late Admiral David Farragut for transport to New York. The following day she went fast aground on Great Point, Nantucket and transferred Admiral Farragut&#x27;s remains to merchant steamer SS &quot;Island Home&quot;. She got afloat on 1 October and continued to New York the following day.

&quot;Guerriere&quot; departed New York on 17 December 1870 for Lisbon, thence past Gibraltar for cruising with the Mediterranean Squadron. On 7 April 1871 she was host to the pasha of Tripoli, who inspected the ship and presented &quot;Guerriere&quot;″s captain with the anchor of the frigate . This anchor had laid on the beach for more than half a century after the destruction of the frigate in Tripoli Harbor by Captain Stephen Decatur in &quot;the most bold and daring act of the age&quot;. From Tripoli the sloop cruised to the ports of Egypt, Lebanon, Italy and France. 

On 1 December 1871 she stood out of Villefranche with the remains of Brevet Major General Robert Anderson, best known for his defense of Fort Sumter, which were transferred to Army authorities off Fort Monroe, Virginia, 6 February 1872. She remained at Norfolk, Virginia until 10 March, then sailed for the New York Navy Yard where she decommissioned on 22 March 1872. She was laid up in ordinary there until 12 December 1872 when she was sold to D. Buchler of New York.

<text>Axel Gabriel Erik Mørch better known as Gabriel Axel (18 April 1918 – 9 February 2014) was a Danish film director, actor, writer and producer, best known for &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1987), which he wrote and directed.

== Biography ==
Born in Aarhus, Denmark, on 18 April 1918, Axel spent most of his childhood in Paris in a wealthy Danish manufacturer&#x27;s family.

In 1935, at age 17 following the family&#x27;s economic collapse, he moved to Denmark and trained as a cabinet maker. In 1942, Axel was admitted to the acting school at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. After graduating in 1945, he returned to France, where he spent five years on stage in Paris, including at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée under theatre director Louis Jouvet. During the winter of 1948–1949 he produced Ludvig Holberg&#x27;s &quot;Diderich Menschenskraek&quot; (&quot;Diderich the Terrible&quot;) at Théâtre de Paris.

Axel returned to Denmark in 1950, and broke through as a stage director in the early 1950s. His productions included &quot;La tête des autres&quot; (&quot;Other People&#x27;s Heads&quot;) by Marcel Aymé, &quot;Le Cid&quot; by Pierre Corneille, and &quot;Pour Lucrèce&quot; by Jean Giraudoux. Axel started directing for television in 1951, and, from 1951 to 1968, did some 48 television dramas.

From 1955, Axel was a director at Nordisk Film. His debut feature, the social-realist drama &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot; (1955), was highly praised, and the breakthrough came with the TV film &quot;A Woman Not Wanted&quot; in 1957.

He went on to direct a string of lighter comedies and farces before making the epic Nordic saga &quot;The Red Mantle&quot; in 1967, which was selected for Cannes Film Festival competition and won a Technical Prize (&quot;Mention spéciale du grand prix technique&quot;) at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. His other films include the popular comedy &quot;The Goldcabbage Family&quot; (1975) and its sequel, and a series of sexually oriented features including the campaigning &quot;Det kære legetøj&quot; (1968) which advocated the legalisation of pornography in Denmark.

With some 16 feature films to his credits Axel returned to France in 1977, where he directed several large projects for French television, culminating in 1985 with a historical five-episode series, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Pillars&quot;).

In 1987, Axel returned to Denmark to direct what had been his dream project for over 15 years, and is considered his masterpiece, an adaptation of Karen Blixen&#x27;s &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot;. After screening at the Cannes Film Festival, the film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 60th Academy Awards among others.

His next films, the youth drama &quot;Christian&quot; (1989), the historical drama &quot;Prince of Jutland&quot; (1994), after the legend of Prince Amleth, and starring Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, and Christian Bale, and &quot;Leïla&quot; (2001), a love story set in Morocco, failed to achieve the same international resonance.

Alongside his directing career, Axel acted in a dozen Danish films, mostly in colourful supporting roles in popular comedies in the 1950s and 60s. He played the lead as the elegant charlatan Marcel de Sade in &quot;The Reluctant Sadist&quot; (1967).

Axel in 1995, was made a Knight of the French National Order of Merit, in 2000 Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and in 2003 was made Officer of the Legion of Honour. In 2003, Axel received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Copenhagen International Film Festival. In 2012 he received the Rungstedlund Award.

Axel died in his sleep on 9 February 2014 at the age of 95.

<doc id="1170432" wikidata="Q6396290" url="?curid=1170432" title="Kevin Flynn (politician)">
<text>Kevin Daniel Flynn (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the riding of Oakville. He served in the cabinet of the government of Kathleen Wynne.
==Background==
Flynn was born in Liverpool, England. He immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of 12. Prior to entering politics he was a small business owner and served as Chair of the Financial Department for the Royal Botanical Gardens. He and his wife Janice live in Oakville, Ontario.

==Politics==
Flynn ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1985, as a New Democrat. He finished a distant third in Oakville, where the NDP has a limited base of support. Later in the year, he was elected as an Oakville Town Councillor and a Halton Regional Councillor.

He ran for election to the Legislative Assembly in the riding of Oakville, this time as a Liberal, in the provincial election of 1999. He was defeated by incumbent Progressive Conservative Gary Carr.

Carr retired in 2003, and later joined the federal Liberal Party. In 2003, Flynn ran for the seat again and this time defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Kurt Franklin by about 3500 votes. The Premier appointed Flynn as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour in 2004. Subsequently, Flynn served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy, the Minister of the Environment, the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities, and the Minister of Education.

In the 2007 election, Flynn ran for re-election and increased his margin of victory to 7096 votes over the Progressive Conservative challenger, Rick Byers.

Flynn has worked to ensure the protection of environmentally-sensitive land in his riding and his town, which is larger than his riding. In November 2004, he was applauded by the local media for his work in reserving 1286 acres (5 km²) of land in North Oakville as public greenspace.
On November 18, 2010, Flynn was nominated as the Liberal party candidate in Oakville for the 2011 provincial election. In the 2011 election, which saw the Liberals reduced to a minority government, Flynn increased his percentage of victory, although his margin of victory was reduced to 4580 votes over the Progressive Conservative challenger, Larry Scott.

Following the election, Flynn unsuccessfully ran to become Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, losing to fellow Liberal Dave Levac, MPP for Brant. In June 2013, he was named Chief Government Whip.

He was re-elected in the 2014 election.

On June 24, 2014, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed him as Minister of Labour.

On June 7, 2018, he was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Stephen Crawford in the 42nd Ontario general election.

Ahead of the 2019 federal election, Flynn sought the federal Liberal nomination in Oakville. On June 12, 2019 Flynn lost the nomination to Anita Anand, who went on to win the general election.

<doc id="1170437" wikidata="Q916201" url="?curid=1170437" title="Oeconomische Encyclopädie">
<text>The Oeconomische Encyclopädie was a German language encyclopedia started by Johann Georg Krünitz. It appeared in 242 volumes between 1773 and 1858. Each volume has about 600–800 pages, giving a total of about 170,000 pages.

It was originally planned to be a translation of two French-language encyclopaedias, &quot;Dictionnaire raisonné universel d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; (1764) and &quot;Encyclopédie Oeconomique ou Système général d&#x27;Oeconomie rustique, domestique et politique&quot; (1771–1772), but developed into a separate work that much surpassed the originals. Significant parts were also based on the &quot;Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon&quot; by Johann Heinrich Zedler.

Krünitz managed to finish 72 volumes during his lifetime. It is said that he died while working on the article &quot;Leiche&quot; (corpse). After his death (1796) Friedrich Jakob Floerken (1758–1799) took over the preparation of volumes 73–77, until he died too. His brother Heinrich Gustav Flörke continued from 1800 to 1813 with volumes 78–123. From 1813 to 1855, Johann Wilhelm David Korth (1783–1861) edited volumes 124–225, at times supported by co-authors Ludwig Kossarski and Carl Otto Hoffmann. Hoffmann then completed the work from 1855 to 1858 with volumes 226–242.

Publishers of the &quot;Krünitz&quot; were successively Joachim Pauli (1773–1812), his widow Louise Pauli (1812–1823), her second husband C.H. Mowinkel (1823–c. 1830), Leopold Wilhelm Krause (c. 1830–1846), and finally Krause&#x27;s stepson Ernst Litfaß (1846–1858).

The full title was:

* originally: &quot;Oekonomische Encyklopädie, oder allgemeines System der Land- Haus- und Staats-Wirthschaft in alphabetischer Ordnung&quot; (&quot;Economic Encyclopaedia, or general system of agriculture, domestic and state economy in alphabetical order&quot;)
* volumes 33–73 and 77–242: &quot;Oekonomisch-technologische Encyklopädie, oder allgemeines System der Staats- Stadt- Haus- und Landwirthschaft und der Kunstgeschichte...&quot; (&quot;Economic-Technological Encyclopaedia, or general system of state, city, domestic economy and agriculture and of art history...&quot;)
*volumes 74–76: &quot;Oekonomisch-technologische Encyklopädie, oder allgemeines System der Staats- Stadt- Haus- und Landwirthschaft, wie auch der Erdbeschreibung, Kunst- und Naturgeschichte...&quot; (&quot;Economic-Technological Encyclopaedia, or general system of state, city, domestic economy and agriculture as well as of geography, art and natural history...&quot;)

<text>Melbourne tram route 109 is a tram route on the Melbourne tramway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Yarra Trams, the route is coloured orange and extends from Box Hill to Port Melbourne over 19.3 kilometre of double track via Whitehorse Road, Victoria Street and Collins Street. It is serviced out of Kew depot utilising A and C class trams.

==History==
The origins of route 109 lie in separate tram lines, a cable tram from Spencer Street to the Yarra River, a horse tram from the Yarra River to Kew Cemetery, an electric line from Kew Junction to Box Hill (extended over the years), as well as the Port Melbourne railway line.

A cable line was opened by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company from Spencer Street to Brunswick Street along Collins Street, MacArthur Street, Gisborne Street and Victoria Parade on 2 October 1886, and extended to the west side of the Yarra River along Victoria Parade and Victoria Street on 22 November 1886. A connecting horse tram was built from the east side of the Yarra River to Kew Cemetery, along Barkers Road, High Street South and High Street, opening on 28 December 1887.

The Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT) opened a line from High Street to Burke Road along Cotham Road on 30 May 1913. On 1 November 1914 the PMTT received permission to convert the horse tram line to electric traction, and the new electric line was opened on 24 February 1915. The PMTT extended the Cotham Road line to Union Road, Mont Albert along Whitehorse Road, on 30 September 1916.

In 1929 the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) started converting the Collins Street cable lines to electric traction, with the last cable tram running down Collins Street on 14 September 1929, and the first electric tram on 8 December 1929. At the same time the MMTB built a new electric line down the centre of Victoria Parade to replace the cable line, which opened on 15 September 1929. For the next six decades the Melbourne to Mont Albert tram was numbered 42, celebrated by a 1982 theatrical production, &quot;Storming Mont Albert by Tram&quot;, which was performed on a specially-chartered Route 42 tram from the Mont Albert terminus to the city and return.

On 21 December 1987, route 111 commenced running from Exhibition (Carlton Gardens) at Nicholson Street to Port Melbourne along Bourke Street, Spencer Street and the former Port Melbourne railway line, following the conversion of the railway (along with the St Kilda line) to light rail. The broad gauge track was re-gauged to standard gauge and the overhead voltage was reduced from 1500 V DC to 600 V DC with light rail platforms built adjacent to or near the former stations platforms.

On 19 December 1993, routes 42 and 111 were combined as route 109. Route 42 continued to run as a peak-hour variant of route 109, and from 18 November 2002, the route deviated from route 109 and ran between Box Hill and the Collins Street West extension in Docklands. From 28 June 2004 until 21 November 2005, the route was truncated back to Spencer Street while Spencer Street station (now Southern Cross station) was redeveloped. It was extended further along the Collins Street extension to Victoria Harbour (Merchant Street) on 21 September 2009. At this point, the route ran one morning trip and three afternoon trips from Box Hill to Victoria Harbour and then back to Box Hill. Route 42 was last listed as an official route in late 2010 / early 2011 before it gradually disappeared without an official announcement.

When Station Pier was refurbished in 1999, tram tracks were laid to allow for route 109 to be extended onto the pier, but have never been connected.

The line was extended from its original terminus at Mont Albert to Box Hill along Whitehorse Road for 2.2 kilometres on 2 May 2003. In January 2016, route 109 began operating through the night on Fridays and Saturdays as part of the Night Network.

==Route==

Route 109 runs from Box Hill, travelling west on Whitehorse Road through the suburbs of Mont Albert, Surrey Hills, Balwyn and Deepdene. Entering Kew at Burke Road, Whitehorse Road becomes Cotham Road. It continues west, through Kew Junction and then south west along High Street, High Street South and turns west into Barkers Road.

It crosses the Yarra River into Victoria Street, Richmond and continues west, at Hoddle Street Victoria Street becomes Victoria Parade, it passes through St Vincent&#x27;s Plaza, passing St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital and turns south onto Gisborne Street, continues south west along MacArthur Street and turns west into Collins Street, entering the CBD, passing Melbourne Town Hall and City Square.

It turns south into Spencer Street, passing Southern Cross station, then crosses the Yarra River and enters Southbank on Clarendon Street before traversing the suburbs of South Melbourne and Port Melbourne on a right-of-way using the former Port Melbourne railway line and terminates at Port Melbourne railway station near Station Pier.

==Operation==
Route 109 is operated out of Kew depot with A and C class trams. For a period from 2002, some services were also operated out of Southbank depot.

==Bus route==
When cruise ships are berthed at Station Pier, Transit Systems Victoria operate a parallel bus service as route 109 between Station Pier and Queens Bridge St.

<doc id="1170458" wikidata="Q118321806" url="?curid=1170458" title="American Pygmy">
<text>The American Pygmy is an American breed of achondroplastic (dwarf) goat. It is small, compact and stockily built. Like the Nigerian Dwarf, it derives from the West African Dwarf group of breeds of West Africa. Between 1930 and 1960, animals of this type were imported to the United States for use either as zoo animals or for research; some were later kept and bred as companion animals and established as a breed in 1975.

It may also be known as the Pygmy or African Pygmy. It is quite different and separate from the British Pygmy breed.

== History ==

Between about 1930 and 1960 a variety of small goats of the West African Dwarf group of breeds of West Africa were imported from zoos in Germany to the United States, to be exhibited in zoos or used as research animals. Some came into the hands of private breeders who kept and bred them as companion animals. By the 1970s, two distinct types had developed: one broad, compact and solid like the original African stock, the other more delicate, much like a dairy goat in miniature. The latter became the Nigerian Dwarf, while the former became the American Pygmy, for which a breed society was established in 1975, and a herd book started in the same year.

In 2007 the conservation status of the American Pygmy was listed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as &quot;endangered&quot;. In 2023 its transboundary risk level was listed in the DAD-IS breed database as &quot;at risk&quot;; its risk level in the United States is unknown – no population data has ever been reported to DAD-IS by the United States Department of Agriculture. In 2019 it was not on the heritage breed watchlist of the Livestock Conservancy.

Two modern American breeds derive in part from the American Pygmy: the Kinder was created by cross-breeding with the Nubian, the Pygora from crossing with Angora stock.

== Characteristics ==

The American Pygmy is small and stocky, with heavy bone: height at the withers is usually in the range , with weights of the order of . Seven color variations are recognised in the breed standard: caramel with black markings, caramel with brown markings, brown agouti, grey agouti, black agouti, black with white markings, and solid black. 

It is polyestrous, prolific and precocious – kids may become sexually mature at two months. Gestation normally lasts 145–153 days.

== Use ==

The American Pygmy is reared for meat or as a companion animal; many are kept in zoos. Because of its small size and ease of handling it may be used for scientific research; it has been found to be a good producer of antibodies for immunological research.

<text>Louis-Albert Vachon, (February 4, 1912 – September 29, 2006) was a Canadian educator, cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, and Archbishop of Quebec.

He became a cardinal on May 25, 1985.

==History==
Vachon was born and raised in Saint-Frédéric, Quebec, one of a family of six. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Minor Seminary of Quebec in 1934 and studied theology at the Major Seminary of Quebec before being ordained by Jean-Marie-Rodrigue Cardinal Villeneuve on June 11, 1938. He then attended Université Laval, graduating in 1941 with a PhD in philosophy. He taught philosophy at Université Laval from 1941 to 1947, then began studies at the Pontifical Athenaeum &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome, Italy, where he was awarded a doctorate degree in theology in 1949 with a dissertation entitled &quot;La vertu d&#x27;espérance et le péché de présomption : leur nature et leur opposition mutuelle.&quot;

Father Vachon returned to Quebec in 1949 to take up the position of Professor of Theology, a position he held from 1949 to 1955. In that year he was nominated as Rector of the Grand Seminary of Quebec and vice-rector of the Université Laval. In 1958 he was appointed Domestic Prelate of His Holiness under Pope John XXIII, a title that gave Vachon the rank and style of monsignor.

In 1960 Vachon was asked to assume the position of rector of the University of Laval; he held this position until 1972. He served in various positions with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec until he was elected Titular Bishop of Mesarfelta and appointed Auxiliary of Quebec on April 4, 1977. He was consecrated on May 14 of that year in Quebec. Vachon was elected Archbishop of Quebec on March 20, 1981, on the retirement of the previous archbishop, Maurice Cardinal Roy, and created Cardinal-Priest by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of May 25, 1985. He received the red biretta and the title of &quot;San Paolo della Croce a Corviale&quot; on that day.

Vachon resigned the pastoral government of the Archdiocese and became Archbishop Emeritus of Quebec on March 17, 1990. Following his retirement, he lived in Quebec City and later in Beauport, Quebec. He died on September 29, 2006, in Quebec City.

He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1969, and an Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1985.

<doc id="1170510" wikidata="Q172871" url="?curid=1170510" title="Riverside International Raceway">
<text>Riverside International Raceway (sometimes known as Riverside, RIR, or Riverside Raceway) was a motorsports race track and road course established in the Edgemont area of Riverside County, California, just east of the city limits of Riverside and east of Los Angeles, in 1957. In 1984, the raceway became part of the newly incorporated city of Moreno Valley. Riverside was noted for its hot, dusty environment, which was a dangerous challenge for drivers. It was also considered one of the finest tracks in the United States. The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400, won by Rusty Wallace, held in 1988. After that final race, a shortened version of the circuit was kept open for car clubs and special events until 1989.

==History==
The racetrack was originally called The Riverside International Motor Raceway, and it was built in early 1957 by a company called West Coast Automotive Testing Corp. The head of West Coast Auto Testing was a retired race driver named Rudy Cleye, from Los Angeles, who had previously raced in Europe. However, the building of the raceway was met with funding difficulties early on and businessman John Edgar provided a much needed cash investment. This late investment prevented any halt in the track&#x27;s construction.

During the first weekend of scheduled races in September 1957, a California Sports Car Club event, John Lawrence of Pasadena, California, died. Lawrence, a former Cal Club member, piloting a 1500 cc Production champion, went off between Turns 5 and 6 . With no crash barrier in place, and no rollbar on the car, Lawrence&#x27;s MGA went up the sand embankment, then rolled back onto the track. Though Lawrence survived the incident, and appeared only slightly injured, he died later at the hospital of a brain injury.

The second major event at the track, in November 1957, was a sports car race featuring some of the top drivers of the day, including Carroll Shelby, Masten Gregory and Ken Miles. Another driver entered was an inexperienced local youngster named Dan Gurney, who had been offered the opportunity to drive a powerful but ill-handling 4.9-liter Ferrari after better-known drivers such as Shelby and Miles had rejected it. Shelby led early but spun and fell back. Gurney assumed the lead and led for much of the event. Shelby, driving furiously to catch up, finally overtook Gurney late in the race and won. Gurney&#x27;s performance caught the eye of North American Ferrari importer Luigi Chinetti, who arranged for Gurney to drive a factory-supported Ferrari at Le Mans in 1958, effectively launching the Californian&#x27;s European career.

Footage exists of classic races like the 1986 Los Angeles Times Grand Prix in which the Chevy Corvette of Doc Bundy, attempting a three-wide pass going into turn 1, hit the Ford Probe of Lyn St. James and the Jaguar of Chip Robinson. St. James&#x27; car caught fire and Robinson nearly cartwheeled into the crowd. St. James survived the flames and Robinson escaped uninjured within the track bounds.

The track was known as a relatively dangerous course, with its long, downhill back straightaway and brake-destroying, relatively slow 180-degree Turn 9 at the end. During the 1965 Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, IndyCar great A. J. Foyt suffered a brake failure at the end of the straight, shot off the road and went end-over-end through the infield at high speed. Crash crews assumed Foyt was dead at the scene, until fellow driver Parnelli Jones noticed a twitch of movement. Ford factory sports car driver Ken Miles was killed there in a testing accident in August 1966 when his Ford sports car prototype (known as the J-car) became aerodynamically unstable and flew out of control at the end of the back straight. In December 1968, American Formula 5000 champion Dr. Lou Sell crashed and overturned in Turn 9 on the first lap of the Rex Mays 300 Indianapolis-style race, suffering near-fatal burns. In January 1967, Canadian driver Billy Foster crashed at Turn 9 during a practice-session just prior to the start of qualifying for the Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, his head striking the wall and causing fatal injuries. These accidents and others caused track management to reconfigure Turn 9, giving the turn a dogleg approach and a much wider radius (a water improvement also closed the raceway for a few months).

In January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962–&#x27;63 NASCAR champion Joe Weatherly, who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely. Weatherly died when he lost control entering Turn 6, hitting the steel barrier almost broadside and had his head snapped out the window against the barrier.

Nevertheless, in 1983 Turn 9 was the site of the only fatality in IMSA GTP history. In the 1983 Times Grand Prix, Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s Joest-constructed Porsche 935 lost its rear wing at the Dogleg and hit two freeway-type barriers sending it into a horrific roll at Turn 9.

Of the entire road course races run at RIR, there was one that was run in a counter-clockwise direction, sometime around 1960. In 1966 Dan Gurney tested his first Eagle racing car on a shorter, counter-clockwise version of the track tailored specifically for his car&#x27;s Indianapolis-specific left-turn oiling system. The test caused Gurney to ask track president Les Richter to hold an Indianapolis-style race there. From 1967 to 1969 the Rex Mays 300 served as the season-ending USAC Indianapolis-car race.

ESPN was live for the June 12, 1988, Budweiser 400 race at RIR and caught racer Ruben Garcia crashing hard off turn 9 and his car went through a tire/guardrail barrier and then went through the fence, destroying a cement barrier before coming to rest near a fence where the fans were sitting on the 32nd lap. He and the fans were unharmed, but the race was red flagged for 25 minutes to repair the wall by adding 2 Jersey barriers.

After 14 years of NASCAR as a driver and later a car owner, Richard Childress won his first NASCAR race in 1983, when Ricky Rudd drove his #3 Piedmont Airlines Chevrolet to victory in the 1983 Budweiser 400k.

From 1981 until 1987, NASCAR&#x27;s championship race was at Riverside. The USAC Championship Trail also held their season ending race from 1967 to 1969. Riverside was also home to track announcer Sandy Reed and (along with former LA Rams player Les Richter) Roy Hord Jr. Both NASCAR team owners Roger Penske and Rick Hendrick drove a select few races at Riverside in their own cars, with Penske winning a Winston West race in 1963, while in the final NASCAR race in 1988, Hendrick got out of the car and let Elliott Forbes-Robinson take over.

The Winston Western 500 came to be known as the signature event at the track. Initially (1963-1981) this race was held in January as the season opener, but beginning in 1982 NASCAR elected to start the season with the Daytona 500. From 1981 to 1987 the Winston Western 500 was held in November as the final race of the season. Until 2020, when Darlington, Charlotte and Daytona each hosted 3 races, 1981 was the only year in NASCAR history that one track held 3 Cup Series events in a single season (Riverside being the season opener, the season&#x27;s halfway point, and the season finale). Riverside was the season finale in 1981 because Ontario Motor Speedway closed after their season ended in 1980.

Riverside also hosted drag racing events. Between 1961 and 1969, the Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races, &quot;one of the most significant drag racing events&quot; of that era, were held at RIR. The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a NHRA national event prize at the time.

Carroll Shelby and Skip Barber had racing schools at Riverside to teach students on how to drive around the racetrack and show them the preferred line on how to enter and exit a corner. Barber was the last racing school to be at Riverside when it was closed in 1989.

==The Four Courses of Riverside==
The track was built to accommodate several different configurations, depending on the series and race length. The three options on Riverside Raceway were the long course (), the short course (), and the NASCAR () course. The original racetrack had a backstretch from 1957 to 1968. When the track was redesigned in 1969 (it had to close for a water relocation project), turn 9 was reconfigured with a wider radius and banked with a dogleg approach added, to reduce strain on the car&#x27;s brakes. The fourth track configuration was a drag racing strip.

Before any racing event at RIR, track crews added traffic pylons to close off sections of the track. The closed sections were determined by the specific course and cars used during any given race.

Throughout its history, various other track configurations were used to adapt the track for events such as off-road, Cal-Club and motorcycle events.

Diagram notes: The long course had the backstretch between turns 8 &amp; 9. This version was used primarily for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Grand Prix, although the long course was also used for Indy car racing in the mid-1980s. When the 1969 version was built, the dogleg was added so as to ease the transition into Turn 9 (the track had seen numerous brake failure-induced accidents approaching turn 9, and this change was made as a safety measure). In the short course, the track would use turn 7A rather than 8. The &quot;turn 7-7A&quot; configuration effectively shortened the back straight to just over one-half mile in length. The NHRA drag strip ran south to north on the backstretch from the runoff to the Bosch Bridge (not shown in diagram), which crossed over the track about halfway between turns 8 &amp; 9.

==Movies and television==
Due to its proximity to the Southern California entertainment industry, RIR was a frequent filming location for racing for Hollywood movies, television series and commercials.

Scenes from the television shows &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;Simon and Simon&quot; were shot on location at RIR. Other shows filmed at RIR include &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Hardcastle &amp; McCormick&quot; and the HBO program &quot;Super Dave Osborne&quot;. The television movie adaptation of &quot;Gemini Man&quot;, &quot;Riding With Death&quot; (1976), featured as an experiment on the television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, also contains footage of racing at Riverside.

RIR was extensively featured in the 1961 telefilm &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;, an episode of the series &quot;Route 66&quot;. The episode stars Martin Milner and George Maharis, and guest stars Frank Overton, Harvey Korman, Regis Toomey and Betsy Jones-Moreland. Milner races a 1960 powder-blue Chevrolet Corvette in the film.

A 1963 Plymouth-sponsored film called &quot;Return to Riverside&quot; was shot at RIR from November 26–29, 1962. The film highlighted various road tests between 1963 Plymouth, Chevrolet, and Ford passenger cars. It featured race car drivers Leroy Neumayer, Clem Proctor and Roger McCluskey. The film was hosted by Sid Collins, the radio voice of the Indianapolis 500.

Film shoots at RIR included scenes from: &quot;Good Guys Wear Black&quot; (1978) &quot;The Betsy&quot; (1978), &quot;Fireball 500&quot; (1966), &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), &quot;The Killers&quot; (1964), &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968), &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959), &quot;Roadracers&quot; (1959), &quot;Speedway&quot; (1968), &quot;Stacey&quot; (1973), &quot;Thunder Alley&quot; (1967) and &quot;Winning&quot; (1969).

===Use in gaming===
The track was used in Sierra Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;NASCAR Legends&quot; (1999) and &quot;NASCAR Heat&quot; (2000), and was later converted to &quot;NASCAR 4&quot; (2001), &quot;NASCAR Racing 2002 Season&quot; (2002), &quot;2003&quot; (2003) and &quot;rFactor&quot; (2005).

Riverside has also been featured in &quot;Indianapolis 500: Evolution&quot; (2009) for the Xbox 360 and can be downloaded into &quot;rFactor&quot; with all three options.

==Closure and transformation into a shopping mall==

RIR was managed by former Los Angeles Rams player Les Richter, who sold the property to real estate developer Fritz Duda in 1971 after American Raceways Inc. (which also owned Texas World Speedway, Atlanta International Raceway, Michigan International Speedway and Trenton Speedway) declared bankruptcy. Duda had once been a turn announcer for NASCAR&#x27;s broadcasting arm Motor Racing Network plus the raceway&#x27;s radio network (along with Ralph Lawler) and many felt racing would long be a part of the Riverside landscape.

During this time, Riverside County and the newly incorporated Moreno Valley area had a growth spurt; new residents started enclosing in on the raceway and became hostile about the raceway&#x27;s noise levels but, furthermore, the land the raceway was on was becoming more and more valuable such that the track was almost able to survive. However, with protests from both residents and environmentalists, Riverside&#x27;s continued existence was impossible. (During this time, track president Dan Greenwood, who succeeded Richter in 1983, was trying to search for Riverside&#x27;s replacement, Perris and Corona.)

1988 was the final year of professional racing for Riverside. On June 12, 1988, NASCAR held its final Winston Cup race at RIR; the 1988 Budweiser 400 was won by Rusty Wallace (a caution flag, later red flag, was out for Ruben Garcia when he came off Turn 9 and lost control of his car and hit a wall, barely missing the grandstands, on lap 29). SCORE International held its last race on August 14, 1988. In 1989, the track was modified from turn 7 to near the dogleg after a section of the backstretch and turn 7A near the Bosh Bridge was severed for Towngate Blvd. and Eucalyptus Ave. The modified track, Riverside Regional Raceway, continued to be used for club events. After 31 years of racing, Riverside closed on July 2, 1989, with the final Cal-Club event (which, ironically, ended the way it started with the death of racer Mark Verbofsky on July 1, 1989).

Duda (along with Homart Development Company) turned the &quot;House that Dan Gurney built&quot; (which had him quoting in an episode in &quot;SpeedWeek&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see it gone&quot;) into a shopping mall which opened in 1992. The Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate is on the northern end of the former raceway property and homes now occupy what was the southern end of the racetrack. In a 1994 aerial view of RIR, the remains of Riverside&#x27;s Turn 9, the original backstretch, the 1969 aligned backstretch from the kink to the entrance to Turn 9, part of the pit entrance and front stretch wall were still visible along with the Administration Building. However, today nothing is left of RIR except for memorabilia from the racetrack. The old Administration Building remained until 2005, when it was torn down to make way for a complex of townhouses.

Numerous streets in the neighborhood to the east of the Moreno Valley Mall off Frederick Street are named after racers that raced at Riverside, such as Yarborough Drive, Gurney Place, Donohue Court, Surtees Court, Brabham Street, Andretti Street and Penske Street.

When Riverside closed in 1989, it followed in the footsteps of Ontario Motor Speedway (in nearby Ontario), which closed in 1980, and was followed by Ascot Park in Gardena in 1991. In the 1990s, two new circuits opened: Auto Club Speedway in nearby Fontana in 1997, and Toyota Speedway at Irwindale (now the Irwindale Event Center) in 1999. Auto Club closed in February 2023 and Irwindale closed in December 2024. Both tracks, like Riverside, were used for filming.

In 2003, the remainder of the old Riverside International Raceway was torn up. The sign that was at State Route 60 and Day Street was removed to make way for both a Lowe&#x27;s warehouse and a new pair of on/off ramps and Turn 9 of the old track is now home to houses.

In 2003, plans were announced to build a road course with a similar design to the famed Riverside layout in Merced, California. The track would have been known as the Riverside Motorsports Park, but the project was abandoned in 2009.

==Coachella Valley==

In 2023, an IndyCar Series test was held in the Coachella Valley area of Riverside County at The Thermal Club, a country club style private circuit in Thermal, California southeast of the former circuit. At the end of the 2023 season, the INDYCAR Thermal Challenge was announced to be held in March 2024, marking a return to major circuit racing in Riverside County. The race is being elevated to full championship status in 2025.

<text>Peterborough is a town in the mid north of South Australia, in wheat country, just off the Barrier Highway. It was originally named Petersburg after the landowner, Peter Doecke, who sold land to create the town. It was one of 69 places in South Australia renamed in 1917 due to anti-German sentiments during World War I.

==History==
The first settlers in the area purchased land from the government in 1875. The first building in the town was constructed four years later. Settler Peter Doecke transferred his land to J H Koch in 1876, who found out in 1880 that the land would be the site of a railway junction. He subdivided it and sold for £1700, after failing to get £500 per acre for it in 1879. By 1880 a hotel and post office had been erected, followed by a school in 1883, and a town hall in 1884.
At the prompting of mayor W. Thredgold, a newspaper, the &quot;Petersburg Times&quot; was founded in 1887 by Robert M. Osborne, became &quot;The Times and Northern Advertiser&quot; in 1919, under the longterm proprietorship of W. H. Bennett and survived as a family business until 1970.

===Heritage listings===

Peterborough has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* 14 Bourke Street: Koch House
* 2 Callary Street: Bishop&#x27;s Palace and Convent, Peterborough
* 2 Jervois Street: Peterborough Police Station, Cells and Courthouse
* 77-79 Kitchener Street: Peterborough Power Station
* Main Street: Peterborough Rotunda
* 105-107 Main Street: General Store, Peterborough
* 106 Main Street Peterborough YMCA Hostel
* 108 Main Street: Peterborough Town Hall
* 193-195 Main Street: Peterborough Hotel
* 227-231 Main Street: Capitol Theatre, Peterborough
* Railway Terrace: Peterborough Roundhouse and Turntable
* Tripney Avenue: Peterborough Gold Battery and Office

==Government==
Peterborough is the seat of the District Council of Peterborough. It is the largest town in the council area. Peterborough is in the state electorate of Stuart and federal Division of Grey. Peterborough at one point in time had its own town council (Corporation of the Town of Peterborough) surrounded by the district council.

==Railways==
Peterborough sat on the intersection of the East-West railway linking Port Pirie and Broken Hill, and the North–South railway linking Adelaide eventually to Alice Springs via Quorn, both narrow gauge () lines between 1917 (when the Trans-Australian Railway opened across the Nullarbor Plain) and 1937 (when a more direct south–north route bypassed the Peterborough–Quorn railway line by connecting Port Pirie to Port Augusta). The Peterborough railway station is still in operation and was formerly a stop for the weekly &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; train.

The line from Port Pirie and Jamestown arrived in 1881, followed shortly after by the line from Terowie in the south and north to Quorn. The line to Broken Hill was completed in 1887.
Peterborough was the home town for Bob the Railway Dog who is remembered by a bronze statue located in the &quot;Main Street&quot;.

In 1970, the east–west line was converted to standard gauge (), and the line south of Peterborough to Terowie to broad gauge (). Thus Peterborough became one of three, triple-gauge railway junctions in Australia. The others being Gladstone and Port Pirie, all on the same railway corridor.

The broad-gauge connection to Adelaide, via Burra, was closed on 26 July 1988. The narrow-gauge line north to Quorn last carried freight in 1980, and was removed, between Eurelia and Bruce in the mid-1980s. Grain trains ran as far as Orroroo into the mid-1980s. In its later years it was used by tourist trains from Steamtown as far as Eurelia. Steamtown ceased operations in 2002, however the roundhouse is still used to display its coaches and locomotives. The District Council, with funding from the three tiers of government and recovery of the Eurelia line, have subsequently established the Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre, with SA&#x27;s first Sound &amp; Light Show.

==Nova Systems Space Precinct==
In early 2022, the Nova Systems Space Precinct was officially established on a site located just outside of Peterborough. Australian defence engineering and technology group Nova Systems originally purchased the site in 2019, when it contained one ground station terminal belonging to the site&#x27;s previous owner, Tyvak. The site now hosts several ground stations on behalf of Tyvak (US), RBC Signals (US), and Leaf Space (Italy). Up to 75 more satellite dishes are planned, each with 16 antennae.

==Media==
The town was home to the &quot;Petersburg Times&quot;, subtitled: &quot;Orroroo Chronicle and Northern Advertiser&quot;, (12 August 1887 – May 1919). The &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; subtitle later evolved to &quot;Terowie, Yongala, and Northern Advertiser,&quot; and finally &quot;Northern Advertiser.&quot; In 1919, the overall name was changed to &quot;The Times and Northern Advertiser, Peterborough, South Australia,&quot; in response to the government&#x27;s wish to remove Germanic placenames.

Peterborough was also home to the short-lived newspaper, &quot;Petersburg Enterprise and Northern Advocate&quot; (20 January – 2 August 1912), which was printed by William John Myers and Walter A. Wade. Another short-lived publication was &quot;Frith&#x27;s Bulletin&quot; (15 April 1913), a monthly magazine published by F.H. Frith, but discontinued after only one issue. A third one at this time was the &quot;Sporting Telegraph&quot; (3 May – 26 July 1913), which was printed by W.H. Bennett for Pritchard Morgan Hall.

More recently, it was also home to the &quot;Peterborough Times&quot; (2003–2006), which later became part of the &quot;Mid North Broadcaster&quot;, a publication released from 2006 to 2013 in Burra. The &quot;Broadcaster&quot; was formed by the merger of struggling local newspapers, the &quot;Peterborough Times&quot;, the &quot;Burra Broadcaster&quot; (1991–2006), and the &quot;Eudunda Observer&quot;. It was owned by the Taylor group, with editorial control via the &quot;Murray Pioneer&quot;. Its distribution included the towns of Burra, Eudunda, Jamestown and Peterborough.

In mid-2021, a Temporary Community Broadcasting Licence (TCBL) was issued by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to Peterborough Community Broadcasting Incorporated. In early 2022, 5PBS commenced broadcasting on 91.1 MHz, servicing Peterborough and surrounding towns including Oodla Wirra, Terowie and Yongala.

==Education==
Peterborough High School was opened in 1927 and caters for students from years 7 to 12.

Peterborough Primary School was opened in 1883 and caters for students from years reception to 6

St Joseph&#x27;s School is a reception to Year 7 Catholic primary school which was founded by Mary MacKillop and the Sisters of St Joseph.

<doc id="1170514" wikidata="Q7875718" url="?curid=1170514" title="USS Yorktown (PG-1)">
<text>USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; was lead ship of her class of steel-hulled, twin-screw gunboats in the United States Navy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was the second U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the American Revolutionary War&#x27;s Battle of Yorktown.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; was laid down by William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia in May 1887 and launched in April 1888. She was just over long and abeam, and displaced . She was equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner-rigged masts. The ship&#x27;s main battery consisted of six guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller-caliber guns.

At launch, &quot;Yorktown&quot; joined the Squadron of Evolution of &quot;New Navy&quot; steel-hulled ships. Detached from that squadron, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, under the command of Robley D. Evans, sailed to Valparaíso, Chile, during the 1891 &quot;Baltimore&quot; Crisis and relieved at that port. After that situation was resolved, &quot;Yorktown&quot; took part in the joint British–American sealing patrol in Alaskan waters and duty on the Asiatic Station before returning to the United States in 1898. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was out of commission during the Spanish–American War, but took part in actions in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion in 1899 and 1900, respectively, after she had been recommissioned.

After three years out of commission from 1903 to 1906, &quot;Yorktown&quot; hosted the Secretary of the Navy on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1908. Over the next five years, most of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, &quot;Yorktown&quot; continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919, and was assigned the hull number PG-1 the following year. She was sold in 1921 to an Oakland, California firm and broken up that same year.

== Design and construction ==

The &quot;Yorktown&quot; class gunboats—unofficially considered third-class cruisers—were the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to the William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard of Philadelphia. The hull for &quot;Yorktown&quot; was designed by the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical design was left to the Cramp yard. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s keel was laid on 14 May 1887.

The ship was launched on 28 April 1888 and sponsored by Mary Cameron, the daughter of U.S. Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania. The dynamite-gun cruiser was launched a few minutes after &quot;Yorktown&quot; in the same ceremony. According to a news account, 25 United States Senators, 180 Congressmen, the Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney, and the governors of six states attended the dual ceremony, many arriving from Washington, D.C., via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s passenger steamer . By 19 March 1889, Cramp had completed &quot;Yorktown&quot; and was prepared to turn her over to the Navy.

=== Layout ===
As built, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was in length and abeam. Her steel hull had an average draft of , which was expected to give her the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water. At the waterline was a turtleback deck of steel that formed a watertight seal over the lower spaces. The deck had a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to below the waterline at the sides of the ship. Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads; the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle.

Above the armored deck, &quot;Yorktown&quot; had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them. The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval-shaped to deflect shot. It was outfitted with a steam-powered steering wheel, a telegraph, and speaking tubes; it was protected by of steel armor plate.

=== Propulsion ===
&quot;Yorktown&quot; was powered by two triple-expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of , three-bladed screw propellers. The cylinders of each engine were 22, 31, and 51 inches (56, 79, and 130 cm) in diameter and had a stroke. Each engine was rated at and together were designed to move the ship at , though the ship exceeded that in her trials.

The engines, situated in separate watertight compartments, were each fed by a pair of coal-fired boilers. Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was in diameter and in length with a total grate area of . &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s coal bunkers could carry up to of the fuel, and were shielded from &quot;shot and shell&quot;. At a near top-speed of 16 knots, the ship could cover in days; at the more economical speed of she could cruiser over 62 days.

To supplement her steam power plant, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was built with three masts that were schooner-rigged. She had a total sail area of . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow &quot;Yorktown&quot; to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime.

=== Armament ===
&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s main battery consisted of six /30 caliber Mark 3 guns, with each gun weighing in excess of . Two were mounted on the forecastle deck, two on the poop deck, and the other pair amidships on the gun deck. The two guns on the gun deck were mounted above the waterline, while the other four were above. The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing at . At an elevation of 30.2°, the guns had a range of . Each gun was shielded with steel plating thick.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s secondary battery consisted of two 6-pounder () guns, two 3-pounder () guns, and two 1-pounder () guns. All were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss. According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication, an armor-piercing round fired from a 6-pounder gun could penetrate of armor at a distance of .

== 1889–1897 ==

The ship was commissioned at the League Island (Philadelphia) Navy Yard on 23 April 1889 under the command of Commander French E. Chadwick.
After &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted her final sea trials, she was assigned to the &quot;Squadron of Evolution&quot;—sometimes also referred to as the &quot;White Squadron&quot;— in late 1889. &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated with that unit as it developed tactical maneuvers for use by the new steel-hulled naval vessels then coming into service in the United States Navy. After this duty, &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed the east coast of the United States on 7 December 1889, bound for European waters; stopped briefly at Fayal in the Azores; and arrived at Lisbon, Portugal, two days before Christmas. The ship subsequently cruised the Mediterranean into the early spring of the following year, calling at ports in Spain, Morocco, France, Italy, Greece, and Malta. Following her return to the United States on 17 June 1890, the warship entered drydock at the New York Navy Yard on 1 July for repairs that lasted until 8 August. Upon the completion of these alterations, &quot;Yorktown&quot; took part in the ceremonies marking the embarkation of the remains of the noted inventor, John Ericsson—of fame—for transportation back to his native Sweden for burial.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; next again operated in the Squadron of Evolution off the eastern seaboard and into the Gulf of Mexico into the summer of 1891. Under Acting Rear Admiral John Grimes Walker, the squadron normally cruised in the Gulf of Mexico from January to April and off the east coast from May to October. While in the gulf, the ships called at Galveston, Texas; New Orleans; and Pensacola, Florida; and carried out target practice in Tampa Bay. Later, the squadron conducted small arms practice at Yorktown, Virginia, after arriving at Hampton Roads. In July 1891, the squadron carried out exercises and maneuvers in connection with the naval militias of New York and Massachusetts during which it added torpedo attacks upon the Fleet to the usual target practices. In addition, it conducted drills and landing exercises. The Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s report for the fiscal year 1891 noted that &quot;useful experience&quot; had been gained by the Squadron of Evolution in the training of commanding, navigating, and watch officers in skillfully and safely maneuvering vessels in formation and in restricted waters. In addition, engineers were trained in regulating and maintaining economical coal consumption.

=== &quot;Baltimore&quot; crisis ===
On 8 October 1891, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, under the command of Commander Robley D. Evans, departed New York to join the Pacific Squadron. The gunboat put into Charlotte Amalie, Danish West Indies, to &quot;coal ship&quot; on 14 October. While the ship was engaged in this duty, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was ordered to Valparaíso, Chile, in response to the &quot;Baltimore&quot; Crisis.

During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, , a cargo ship employed by Chilean Congressionalists, had loaded weaponry in California, but was detained in San Diego by U.S. officials. After &quot;Itata&quot; was able to slip away from San Diego, caught up with the ship at the Chilean port of Iquique in July 1891 and escorted the ship back to San Diego before her cargo could be unloaded. In October, some months after the &quot;Itata&quot; Incident had ended, the American cruiser put in at Valparaíso. On 16 October, a group of sailors from &quot;Baltimore&quot; ashore on liberty were attacked by Congressionalists, still angry at the &quot;Itata&quot; affair. Two of &quot;Baltimore&quot;″s sailors were killed and eighteen wounded; thirty-six other American sailors were arrested by the local authorities. Tensions ran high in both Chile and the United States.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;, a part of the United States&#x27; response, departed Charlotte Amalie for Valparaíso on 17 October for a six-week, storm-tossed voyage around the South American continent via the Straits of Magellan. Less than two weeks after &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s 30 November arrival, &quot;Baltimore&quot; departed, leaving American interests in the hands of Evans and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Over the ensuing weeks, Chile and the United States came close to war, but cooler heads prevailed. Locally, Evans&#x27; patience was &quot;dangerously tested&quot;, but it held. One inflammatory incident occurred when Chilean torpedo boats bore down on Evans&#x27; ship, turning their helms hard over at the last possible instant to avoid a collision. On another occasion, a group of locals threw rocks at Evans and his gig as it lay at the foot of a jetty.

After a month at Valparaíso, &quot;Yorktown&quot; took on refugees from the American, Spanish, and Italian legations in mid-January 1892. She got underway on the 19th and arrived at Callao, Peru, on the 25th. While &quot;Yorktown&quot; lay anchored there, tension between the United States and Chile relaxed and the crisis abated, and the Chilean later government provided compensation for the families of the American sailors that were killed.

=== Sealing patrol ===
&quot;Yorktown&quot; stood out of Callao on 4 March 1892, steamed northward via San Diego and San Francisco, and eventually arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there until late in the following month. Having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident, Evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that, if handled wrongly, could have caused ill-feeling with the British.

That spring, &quot;Yorktown&quot;—along with two other naval vessels and a trio of revenue cutters—headed toward Arctic waters on 27 April to protect the great herds of seals in the Bering Sea from poachers. Traveling along the west coast of the United States, the gunboat and her crew &quot;braced&quot;, in Evans&#x27; words, &quot;at the prospect of doing something&quot;. As at Valparaíso, Evans faced the possibility of becoming involved in an international incident arising from possible confrontations with Canadian sealers. Operating under the protection of the British crown, the latter had taken particularly heavy catches. Many American vessels put to sea under the British flag in an attempt to evade prosecution by their own government. The British agreed to help put an end to the slaughter of seals and decided upon joint action with the United States in prosecuting the poachers. About 110 schooners, large and small, made up the sealing fleet, typically &quot;armed&quot; with double-barrelled shotguns for killing the animals and Winchester rifles for dealing with any humans who attempted to interfere. The fact that the great majority of seals killed had been female —still with young in many cases—almost doubled the toll of slain seals. As Evans noted: &quot;the slaughter in the North Pacific was fearful&quot;.

Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, &quot;Yorktown&quot; put to sea on 13 May, arriving at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, &quot;Yorktown&quot; guarded the passes to the Bering Sea. The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on in spite of the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon.

=== Telescopic gunsight ===

Besides the patrols made during this deployment in northwestern waters, &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted routine operations such as target practices. Among the officers assigned to the ship at that time was Lt. Bradley Fiske, a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight. Fiske&#x27;s sight had been tested in &quot;Baltimore&quot; and had favorably impressed that ship&#x27;s officers—including her commander, Captain Winfeld S. Schley. Evans, however, had not taken a liking to Fiske&#x27;s newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board &quot;Yorktown&quot; (the first one had failed miserably). On the afternoon of 22 September 1892, during scheduled target practice, Fiske&#x27;s invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans. As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute&#x27;s magazine &quot;Proceedings&quot;, modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British Navy but in the American—off Unalaska on 22 September 1892, in &quot;Yorktown&quot;.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; continued her task of patrolling until 21 September when she departed Unalaska for the Mare Island Navy Yard. From 11 to 24 October, the ship underwent repairs there before proceeding on to the east coast via Cape Horn. &quot;Yorktown&quot; eventually arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 February 1893.

After repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 25 April to 26 July, &quot;Yorktown&quot; retraced her route south and sailed again around Cape Horn back into the Pacific. She then moved north to resume patrolling the Bering Sea. She protected seal rookeries into 1894 before returning to Mare Island for repairs which lasted into mid-September.

On 24 September 1894, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed for the western Pacific and duty on the Asiatic Station. Sailing via Honolulu, she reached Yokohama, Japan, on 8 December 1894 and spent the next three years, under the command of Commander Charles Stockton touching at the principal ports-of-call along the coasts of China and Japan. She departed Yokohama early in the autumn of 1897 and made port at Mare Island on 18 November 1897. Subsequently, laid up at Mare Island and decommissioned on 8 December, the gunboat remained inactive there through the Spanish–American War in 1898.

== 1898–1903 ==
Recommissioned on 17 November 1898, with Commander Charles S. Sperry in command, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed again for the Far East on 7 January 1899. Rumors of German machinations in Samoa lengthened &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s stay at Hawaii from a few days to a few weeks; but, when the anticipated trouble failed to materialize, &quot;Yorktown&quot; resumed her voyage to the Philippine Islands. On 23 February, she arrived at Cavite Navy Yard, near Manila where patrolled to prevent gun-runners thought to be supplying guns and ammunition to the &quot;Insurrectos&quot;, Filipinos fighting for independence.

At one point, rumors flew concerning possible German gun-running activities; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; patrolled off the entrance to Subic Bay and from thence to Lingayen to keep a lookout for the filibusters. She continued coastal patrol work over the next three years, cooperating with the Army, transporting and convoying troops, and patrolling wide areas of often badly charted waters. Upon occasion, &quot;Yorktown&quot; served as &quot;mother ship&quot; to smaller gunboats, providing officers and men to staff the smaller patrol craft. Ensigns William Harrison Standley and Harry E. Yarnell (both future admirals) and future naval historian and archivist Dudley Wright Knox were among the junior officers who served in &quot;Yorktown&quot; during this time.

During the Philippine–American War, &quot;Yorktown&quot; stood in to Baler Bay, on the west coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish garrison that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship&#x27;s whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river&#x27;s mouth and out of sight of &quot;Yorktown&quot;. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.

In 1899, the situation in China worsened until it culminated in the Boxer Rebellion. The following spring, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was withdrawn from her patrol duties in the northern Philippines to provide assistance to the operations off the coast of North China. She departed Manila on 3 April 1900, bound for China; and, after she reached the mainland, her landing force served ashore at Taku. In addition, Marines from &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in the actions at Tientsin between June and July. Under the command of Commander Edward D. Taussig from June 1900 to June 1901, she continued to support the China Relief Expedition forces. In June 1900, she assisted back off a reef near that Chinese port.

The gunboat departed Shanghai on 10 September 1900 and reached Cavite on the 17th. In the Philippines, she resumed her cooperation with Army forces, still engaged in pacification operations, and continued these duties for the next two years. In between pacification missions, she performed survey work: at Guam in November 1901 and at Dumanquillas Bay, Philippines, in February 1903. In April 1902, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Coxswain Joseph Quick rescued a shipmate from drowning while the ship was in port at Yokohama, Japan. For his efforts, Quick was awarded a peacetime Medal of Honor. &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed the Far East in early 1903 and returned to Mare Island on 3 June. Two weeks later, on the 17th, she was decommissioned.

== 1906–1912 ==
Recommissioned at Mare Island on 1 October 1906, with Commander Richard T. Mulligan in command, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was fitted out there until 9 November. Underway on that day, she operated off the west coasts of Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua into the following summer. After repairs at San Francisco and Mare Island, &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted target practice at Magdalena Bay, Mexico, and relieved as station ship at Acapulco. She then cruised with the 2d Squadron of the Pacific Fleet to Magdalena Bay and San Francisco. Over the ensuing months, &quot;Yorktown&quot; continued her regular local operations.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; hosted the Secretary of the Navy, Victor H. Metcalf, to witness the arrival of the Great White Fleet—commanded by &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s former commander, Robley &quot;Fightin&#x27; Bob&quot; Evans—into San Francisco. The fleet arrived on 6 May 1908, and the flagship saluted the secretary&#x27;s flag on &quot;Yorktown&quot; with the discharge of seventeen guns. Metcalf also boarded &quot;Yorktown&quot; on the 8th to review the assembled battleships, armored cruisers, and torpedo boats of the Pacific and Great White Fleets. On 30 May 1908, &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in festivities for the Rose Festival at Portland, Oregon. From June to September, &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted seal patrols in Alaskan waters, out of Nome, Unalaska, and Sitka and, between 15 and 19 September, established a site for a wireless station at Valdez. Afterwards, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed south to rejoin the Pacific Fleet, conducting battle practices between 19 November and 1 December at Magdalena Bay. She later joined the armored cruisers and and the tender at Acajutla, El Salvador, before sailing for Corinto, Nicaragua, in March 1909. After more target practices at Magdalena Bay, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was repaired at Mare Island in June and into July before shifting to Seattle, to participate in festivities for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Later in July, the ship visited Esquimalt, British Columbia. She subsequently cruised off the Pacific coast and participated in the Portolá Festival at San Francisco in October.

From 13 December 1909 to 27 March 1910, &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated off Corinto, Nicaragua, with the Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron. She then pursued a schedule of exercises and maneuvers, operating between California and British Columbia through June and July. She returned to a posture of readiness off Corinto and San Juan del Sur between 13 August and 7 September. She then operated off Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Peruvian ports, with the United States Consul General at Large embarked, between 19 September and 16 October before putting into Panama for coal and stores. She subsequently patrolled at Amapala, Honduras, and the familiar Corinto for most of November and December. She spent Christmas at Corinto before shifting to Amapala, en route to San Francisco and Mare Island. From March to July 1911, &quot;Yorktown&quot; cruised off the west coasts of Mexico, Nicaragua, and Honduras. On 29 May, she rescued the survivors from the foundered Panamanian steamer , which had sunk with the loss of 60 of its 100 passengers and crew. Another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 proceeded the ship&#x27;s duties off the Pacific coasts of South and Central America. She returned to Mare Island in May 1912, and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 July.

== 1913–1919 ==
Recommissioned on 1 April 1913, with Commander George B. Bradshaw in command, &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated out of San Diego on shakedown into mid-April. She was soon back at Corinto, however, remaining in Nicaragua until 5 June. After a brief period of operations off the coast, she returned to Corinto on 21 June and remained there for over a month before departing on 31 July to coal at Salina Cruz, Mexico. She moved to Mazatlán on 10 August and there picked up mail, delivering it to the port of Topolobampo, Mexico, on the 11th. &quot;Yorktown&quot; remained there until mid-September.

For the remainder of 1913, &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of Mexican ports: Mazatlán, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, &quot;Yorktown&quot; served in Mexican waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, &quot;Yorktown&quot; continued her routine of patrols off Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego.
After the United States joined the Allies, &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated off the coast of Mexico until August 1917, when she paused briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, &quot;Yorktown&quot; rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on Clipperton Island. From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. After her time off the Mexican coast, &quot;Yorktown&quot; then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax, soon thereafter before returning to New York. She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California.

Arriving at San Diego on 15 February 1919, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was placed out of commission at Mare Island on 12 June 1919. On 17 June 1920, she was assigned the hull number &quot;PG-1&quot;. The veteran steel-hulled gunboat was sold to the Union Hide Company of Oakland, California, on 30 September 1921; she was broken up in Oakland sometime after that.

<text>Charles Monroe Sheldon (February 26, 1857 – February 24, 1946) was an American Congregationalist minister and a leader of the Social Gospel movement. His 1896 novel &quot;In His Steps&quot; introduced the principle &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;, which articulated an approach to Christian theology that became popular at the turn of the 20th century and enjoyed a revival almost one hundred years later. The stretch of US-24 on the north side of Topeka, Kansas, between US-75 and K-4 is named the &quot;Charles Sheldon Trafficway&quot; in his honor.

==Education and ministry==
Charles Sheldon was born in Wellsville, New York. He was a graduate of Phillips Academy, Andover (class of 1879), and of Brown University in 1883. He pastored a church at Waterbury, Vermont, from 1886 to 1888, and in 1889 became pastor of the Central Congregational Church in Topeka, Kansas.

Sheldon became an advocate of the late-nineteenth-century school of thought known as Christian Socialism. His theological outlook focused on the practicalities of the moral life, de-emphasizing the doctrinal traditions of personal redemption from sin in Christ. In the winter of 1896 Sheldon developed a sermon story that he read as a weekly series from the pulpit of Central Congregational Church. The unifying theme of these sermons was based on asking oneself the question &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; when facing moral decisions. He viewed this question as central to Christianity, and likely drew some inspiration from William T. Stead&#x27;s &quot;If Christ came to Chicago!&quot; (1893) and other earlier sources.

==Novel and theological influence==
The theme of the sermons was later fictionalized into the novel &quot;In His Steps&quot;. The central ethos of the novel was not about personal redemption but about moral choices related to encountering circumstances of poverty and deprivation. Sheldon&#x27;s theological motif reflected his socialist outlook. Sheldon&#x27;s own parish work became identified with the Social Gospel.

Walter Rauschenbusch, widely viewed as the chief architect of the Social Gospel, acknowledged the importance Sheldon placed on imitating Jesus. He saw the significance of Sheldon&#x27;s work in bringing home the realization that it is hard to live a Christ-like life, given the temptations of modern society. While Rauschenbusch found this awareness valuable, he saw that it did not demand what he believed was a necessary transformation of social institutions. Sheldon was in touch with the concerns of middle-class America at the end of the century. He saw his role as one of communication—to introduce his congregation and the wider public to the ideas of Lyman Abbott, Richard Ely, George Herron, and Rauschenbusch. That was his intention in writing &quot;In His Steps.&quot;

Of the social issues Sheldon espoused during his lifetime, the two he was most passionate about were equality and prohibition. He believed that all persons were equal and should be treated as such. He was a pioneer among Protestant ministers in welcoming blacks into a mainstream church. He was also committed to fair treatment for Jews and Catholics, and proclaimed the equality of men and women. A strong supporter of the feminist struggle for equal rights, he urged women to enter politics. He also pushed for full equality in the workplace.

Sheldon was also a vegetarian who promoted compassion towards animals just as he did towards humans. He even criticized circuses for their treatment of animals.

==Newspaper career==
In March 1900 Sheldon became editor for a week of &quot;The Topeka Daily Capital&quot;, applying the &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; concept. In that short time, the newspaper&#x27;s circulation exploded from just under 12,000 to 387,000, overwhelming the paper&#x27;s Topeka printing plant and forcing it to outsource the printing of 120,000 copies each to Chicago and New York City.

After his retirement from Central Congregational Church in 1920, Sheldon edited the &quot;Christian Herald, An Illustrated News Weekly for the Home&quot;, a religious periodical, from 1920 to 1924, and continued to write articles after his final retirement in 1924.

==Renewed interest a century later==
In the 1990s, around the centennial of the original publication of Sheldon&#x27;s novel &quot;In His Steps&quot;, WWJD bracelets became a popular item, especially among young people, and publishers increased sales of the book (which is in the public domain), tying it in with marketing of &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; items.

A ten-part miniseries produced in 2008 by Topeka PBS affiliate KTWU features an hour-long segment &quot;Beyond Theology: What Would Jesus Do?&quot; which examines how this question might be considered in the context of the political, social, and cultural changes that have taken place in America. The program also looks at the manner in which Sheldon applied the Social Gospel in his own life and in his community.

<doc id="1170520" wikidata="Q1185127" url="?curid=1170520" title="Louisiana Creole">
<text>Louisiana Creole is a French-based creole language spoken by fewer than 10,000 people, mostly in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Also known as Kouri-Vini, it is spoken today by people who may racially identify as white, black, mixed, and Native American, as well as Cajun and Creole. It should not be confused with its sister language, Louisiana French, a dialect of the French language. Many Louisiana Creoles do not speak the Louisiana Creole language and may instead use French or English as their everyday languages.

Due to the rapidly shrinking number of speakers, Louisiana Creole is considered an endangered language.

==Origins and historical development==

Louisiana was colonized by the French beginning in 1699, as well as Acadians who were forced out of Acadia around the mid-18th century. Colonists were large-scale planters, small-scale homesteaders, and cattle ranchers; the French needed laborers, as they found the climate very harsh. They began to import enslaved Africans, as they had done in their Caribbean island colonies. Two-thirds of the slaves brought to Louisiana originated in the Senegambian region, speaking Malinke, Sereer, Wolof, Pulaar, and Bambara. The largest group from Senegambia was the Bambara, who spoke mutually intelligible dialects of the Malinke language.

Also, the monopoly held by the Company of Indies in both Senegal and Louisiana may also have contributed to the Africans&#x27; relative ancestral homogeneity. Because of this homogeneity, retention of the Africans&#x27; indigenous languages may have hindered the development of a Creole in Louisiana. In fact, the Pointe Coupee slave revolt in 1731 was organized by the Bambara who were purportedly speaking their ancestral languages to plan the coup. Ultimately, Louisiana Creole did develop, with West African languages becoming the substrates to a varied French lexifier. The importation of enslaved people by the French regime continued until 1743.

The language developed in 18th-century Louisiana from interactions among speakers of the lexifier language of Standard French and several substrate or adstrate languages from Africa. Prior to its establishment as a creole, the precursor was considered a pidgin language. The social situation that gave rise to the Louisiana Creole language was unique, in that the lexifier language was the language found at the contact site. More often the lexifier is the language that arrives at the contact site belonging to the substrate/adstrate languages. Neither the French, the French-Canadians, nor the enslaved Africans were native to the area; this fact categorizes Louisiana Creole as a contact language that arose between exogenous ethnicities. Once the pidgin tongue was transmitted to the next generation as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; (who were considered the first native speakers of the new grammar), it could effectively be classified as a creole language.

No standard name for the language has existed historically. In the language, community members in various areas of Louisiana and elsewhere have referred to it by many expressions, though Kréyol/Kréyòl has been the most widespread. Until the rise of Cajunism in the 1970s and 1980s, many Louisiana Francophones also identified their language as Créole, since they self-identified as Louisiana Creoles. In Louisiana&#x27;s case, self-identity has determined how locals identify the language they speak. This leads to linguistic confusion. To remedy this, language activists beginning in the 2010s began promoting the term Kouri-Vini, to avoid any linguistic ambiguity with Louisiana French.

The boundaries of historical Louisiana were first shaped by the French, then, in statehood after 1812, took on its modern form. By the time of the Louisiana Purchase by the U.S in 1803, the boundaries came to include most of the Central United States, ranging from present-day Montana; parts of North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado; all of South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas; part of Southeast Texas; all of Oklahoma; most of Missouri and Arkansas; as well as Louisiana.

In 1978, researchers located a document from a murder trial in the colonial period that acknowledges the existence of Louisiana Creole. The documentation does not include any examples of orthography or structure.

In an 1807 document, a grammatical description of the language is included in the experiences of an enslaved woman recorded by C.C. Robin. This was prior to arrival in Louisiana of French-speaking colonists and enslaved Africans from Saint-Domingue; the whites and free people of color (also French speaking) were refugees from the Haitian Revolution, which had established the first empire in the western hemisphere. The statements collected from Robin showed linguistic features that are now known to be typical of Louisiana Creole.

The term &quot;Criollo&quot; appears in legal court documents during the Spanish colonial period (1762–1803); the Spanish reference to the language stated that it was used among enslaved people and whites.

The importation of enslaved Africans increased after France ceded the colony to Spain, in 1763, following France&#x27;s defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe. Some Spaniards immigrated to the colony, but it was dominated by French language and culture. Like South Carolina, Louisiana had a &quot;minority&quot; population of Africans that greatly outnumbered the European settlers, including those white Creoles born in the colony.

==Language shift, endangerment and revitalization==
In the case of Louisiana Creole, a &quot;diglossia&quot; resulted between Louisiana Creole and Louisiana French. Michael Picone, a lexicographer, proposed the term &quot;Plantation Society French&quot; to describe a version of French which he associated with plantation owners, plantation overseers, small landowners, military officers/soldiers and bilingual, free people of color, as being a contributor to Louisiana Creole&#x27;s lexical base. Over the centuries, Louisiana Creole&#x27;s negative associations with slavery stigmatized the language to the point where many speakers are reluctant to use it for fear of ridicule. In this way, the assignment of &quot;high&quot; variety (or H language) was allotted to standard Louisiana French and that of &quot;low&quot; variety (or L language) was given to Louisiana Creole and to Louisiana French.

The social status of Louisiana Creole further declined as a result of the Louisiana Purchase. Americans and their government made it illegal for Francophones to speak their language. In 1921, the State of Louisiana mandated that public education take place in English only. Children and adults were often punished by corporal punishment, fines, and social degradation. By the 21st century, other methods were enforced. The promise of upward socioeconomic mobility and public shaming did the rest of the work, prompting many speakers of Louisiana Creole to abandon their stigmatised language in favor of English. Additionally, the development of industry, technology and infrastructure in Louisiana reduced the isolation of Louisiana Creolophone communities and resulted in the arrival of more English-speakers, resulting in further exposure to English. Because of this, Louisiana Creole exhibits more recent influence from English, including loanwords, code-switching and syntactic calquing.

Today, Louisiana Creole is spoken by fewer than 6,000 people. Though national census data includes figures on language usage, these are often unreliable in Louisiana due to respondents&#x27; tendencies to identify their language in line with their ethnic identity. For example, speakers of Louisiana Creole who identify as Cajuns often label their language &#x27;Cajun French&#x27;, though on linguistic grounds their language would be considered Louisiana Creole.

Efforts to revitalize French in Louisiana have placed emphasis on &quot;Cajun French&quot;, to the exclusion of Creole. Zydeco musician Keith Frank has made efforts through the use of social media not only to promote his music, but preserve his Creole heritage and language as well, most notably through the use of Twitter. Additionally, Frank developed a mobile application in 2012 titled the &quot;ZydecoBoss App&quot;, which acts as a miniature social network linked to a user&#x27;s Facebook and Twitter accounts, allowing users to provide commentary in real time amongst multiple platforms. Aside from social media activism, Frank also created a creole music festival in 2012 called the &quot;Creole Renaissance Festival&quot;, which acts a celebration of Creole culture. 

A small number of community organizations focus on promoting Louisiana Creole, for example CREOLE, Inc. and the &quot;Creole Table&quot; founded by Velma Johnson. Northwestern State University developed the Creole Heritage Centre, designed to bring people of Louisiana Creole heritage together, as well as preserve Louisiana Creole through their Creole Language Documentation Project. In addition, there is an active online community of language-learners and activists engaged in language revitalization, led by language activist Christophe Landry. 

These efforts have resulted in the creation of a popular orthography, a digitalized version of Valdman et al.&#x27;s &quot;Louisiana Creole Dictionary&quot;, and a free spaced repetition course for learning vocabulary hosted on Memrise created by a team led by Adrien Guillory-Chatman. A first language primer was released in 2017 and revised into a full-length language guide and accompanying website in 2020. 2022 saw the publication of an anthology of contemporary poetry in Louisiana Creole, the first book written completely in the language. A December 2023 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; highlighted revitalization efforts with the headline &quot;Louisiana Creole is enjoying a modest revival,&quot; focusing in particular on language activists Jourdan Thibodeaux and Taalib Pierre-Auguste.

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers of Louisiana Creole are mainly concentrated in south and southwest Louisiana, where the population of Creolophones is distributed across the region. St. Martin Parish forms the heart of the Creole-speaking region. Other sizeable communities exist along Bayou Têche in St. Landry, Avoyelles, Iberia, and St. Mary Parishes. There are smaller communities on False River in Pointe-Coupée Parish, in Terrebonne Parish, and along the lower Mississippi River in Ascension, St. Charles Parish, and St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes.

There once were Creolophones in Natchitoches Parish on Cane River and sizable communities of Louisiana Creole-speakers in adjacent Southeast Texas (Beaumont, Houston, Port Arthur, Galveston) and the Chicago area. Natchitoches, being the oldest colonial settlement in Louisiana, proved to be predominantly creole since its inception. Native inhabitants of the local area Louisiana Creole speakers in California reside in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino counties and in Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento County, Plumas County, Tehama County, Mono County, and Yuba County). Historically, there were Creole-speaking communities in Mississippi and Alabama (on Mon Louis Island); however, it is likely that no speakers remain in these areas.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Louisiana Creole has much in common with those of other French-based creole languages. In comparison to most of these languages, however, Louisiana Creole diverges less from the phonology of French in general and Louisiana French in particular.

=== Consonants ===

The table above shows the consonant sounds of Louisiana Creole, not including semivowels and . In common with Louisiana French, Louisiana Creole features postalveolar affricates and , as in ‘weak coffee’ and ‘mouth’. The nasal palatal usually becomes a nasal palatal approximant when between vowels, which results in the preceding vowel becoming nasalized. At the end of a word, it typically is replaced by or .

=== Vowels ===
The table above shows the oral and nasal vowels of Louisiana Creole as identified by linguists.

==== Vowel rounding ====
Speakers of the language may use rounded vowels , and where they occur in French. This is subject to a high degree of variation with the same region, sociolinguistic group, and even within the same speaker. Examples of this process include:

* &#x27;rice&#x27;, compare French &quot;du riz&quot; 
* &#x27;old&#x27;, compare French &quot;vieux&quot; 
* &#x27;mouth&#x27;, compare French &quot;gueule&quot; 

==== Vowel lowering ====
The open-mid vowel may lowered to the near-open vowel when followed by , e.g. &#x27;brother&#x27;.

==== Regressive and progressive nasalization of vowels ====
In common with Louisiana French, Louisiana Creole vowels are nasalized where they precede a nasal consonant, e.g. &#x27;young&#x27;, &#x27;apple&#x27;. Unlike most varieties of Louisiana French, Louisiana Creole also exhibits progressive nasalization: vowels following a nasal consonant are nasalized, e.g. &#x27;know&#x27;.

==Grammar==
Louisiana Creole exhibits subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.

=== Determiners ===
In 19th-century sources, determiners in Louisiana Creole appear related to specificity. Bare nouns are non-specific. As for specific nouns, if the noun is presupposed it took a definite determiner (&quot;-la&quot;, singular; &quot;-la-ye&quot;, plural) or by an indefinite determiner (&quot;en,&quot; singular; &quot;de&quot; or &quot;-ye&quot;, plural). Today, definite articles in Louisiana Creole vary between the &quot;le&quot;, &quot;la&quot; and &quot;lê&quot;, placed before the noun as in Louisiana French, and post-positional definite determiners -&quot;la&quot; for the singular, and -&quot;yé&quot; for the plural. This variation is but one example of the influence of Louisiana French on Louisiana Creole, especially in the variety spoken along the Bayou Têche which has been characterized by some linguists as decreolized, though this notion is controversial.

Some speakers of that variety display a highly variable system of number and gender agreement, as evidenced in possessive pronouns.

==== Personal pronouns ====

Possession is shown by noun-noun possessum-possessor constructions (e.g. &quot;lamézon mô papa&quot; &#x27;house (of) my grandfather&#x27;) or with the preposition &quot;a&quot; (e.g. &quot;lamézon a mô papa&quot; &#x27;house of my grandfather&#x27;).

=== Verbs ===

==== Verbal morphology ====
Older forms of Louisiana Creole featured only one form of each verb without any inflection, e.g. &#x27;to eat&#x27;. Today, the language typically features two verb classes: verbs with only a single form ( &#x27;to drink&#x27;) and verbs with a &#x27;long&#x27; or &#x27;short&#x27; form (, &#x27;to eat&#x27;).

==== Tense, aspect, mood ====
Like other creole languages, Louisiana Creole features preverbal markers of tense, aspect and mood as listed in the table below 
==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Louisiana Creole is primarily of French origin, as French is the language&#x27;s lexifier. Some local vocabulary, such as topography, animals, plants are of Amerindian origin. In the domains folklore and Voodoo, the language has a small number of vocabulary items from west and central African languages. Much of this non-French vocabulary is shared with other French-based creole languages of North America, and Louisiana Creole shares all but a handful of its vocabulary with Louisiana French.

==Writing system==

The current Louisiana Creole alphabet consists of twenty-three letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet (not including c, q, or x) and several special letters and diacritics.


== Language samples ==

===Numbers===

===Greetings===
===Common phrases===
===The Lord&#x27;s Prayer===
Catholic prayers are recited in French by speakers of Louisiana Creole. Today, some language activists and learners are leading efforts to translate the prayers.

Nouzòt Popá, ki dan syèl-la
Tokin nom, li sinkifyè,
N&#x27;ap spéré pou to
rwayonm arivé, é n&#x27;a fé ça
t&#x27;olé dan syèl; parèy si latær
Donné-nou jordi dipin tou-lé-jou,

lê moun ki fé nouzòt sikombé tentasyon-la,
Mé délivré nou depi mal.

<doc id="1170521" wikidata="Q7968707" url="?curid=1170521" title="War of the Romantics">
<text>The &quot;War of the Romantics&quot; is a term used by some music historians to describe the schism among prominent musicians in the second half of the 19th century. Musical structure, the limits of chromatic harmony, and program music versus absolute music were the principal areas of contention. The opposing parties crystallized during the 1850s. The most prominent members of the &quot;conservative&quot; circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn. Their opponents, the &quot;radical progressives&quot; mainly from Weimar, were represented by Franz Liszt and the members of the so-called New German School (German: &quot;Neudeutsche Schule&quot;), and by Richard Wagner. The controversy was German and Central European in origin; musicians from France, Italy, and Russia were only marginally involved.

==The conservatives==
Clara Schumann, Joseph Joachim and Johannes Brahms were early key members of a &quot;conservative&quot; group of musicians. This core of supporters maintained the artistic legacy of Robert Schumann, Clara&#x27;s husband, who had died in 1856.

While Robert Schumann had been a progressive critic and editor of the influential music periodical &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, which he had founded in 1834, he was never a true admirer of Liszt. However, as Schumann maintained exceptionally enthusiastic and artistically fruitful friendships with the emerging vanguard of radical romantics — Liszt in particular — as well as with musical conservatives such as Mendelssohn and Gade, he remained cordial with Liszt at first. He praised Liszt&#x27;s piano playing in &quot;Neue Zeitschrift&quot; and reviewed his Leipzig concerts in 1840 favorably. However, as Lisztomania swept through Europe after 1842, both he and Clara believed that Liszt had become self-deluded. After Schumann sold the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift&quot; to Franz Brendel in 1845, it became an enthusiastic supporter of Liszt and his circle. It also openly played down Mendelssohn and other conservative composers. Though the final break between Liszt and the Schumanns would not come until 1848, the editorial turn that &quot;Neue Zeitschrift&quot; had taken would color their relations for the rest of their lives. While Liszt remained cordial and at times generous on a professional level toward the Schumanns, they became openly hostile to him.

Clara Schumann had long been the more conservative aesthete in the Schumann marriage. She perceived the editorial change in &quot;Neue Zeitschrift&quot; as a slight against her husband&#x27;s legacy. The young Brahms, who had been very close to the Schumanns during Robert&#x27;s decline, also took up the cause. Joachim, who was a friend of both Clara and Brahms, joined them in his opposition to Liszt and the New German School. A child prodigy, Joachim at 17 had become professor of violin at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he forged close ties with Mendelssohn, the Schumanns and Ferdinand David. Two years later, he became concertmaster of the Weimar Court Orchestra under Liszt&#x27;s direction. His three years in Weimar left him with poor impressions of Liszt&#x27;s conducting and compositions. His opinion of Liszt&#x27;s music and that of the rest of the New German School was reinforced by his correspondence with Brahms and Clara.

Brahms&#x27;s personal experience with Liszt had been limited to a single visit to Weimar in 1853, when he presented some of his compositions to a group that included Liszt, Peter Cornelius and Joachim Raff. After Liszt played some of Brahms&#x27;s work, he performed his own B-minor Piano Sonata. Brahms was impressed neither with Liszt&#x27;s music nor with that of most of the rest of the New German School. The exception was Wagner.

The critic Eduard Hanslick was very influential on the conservatives&#x27; behalf, as his view of music as &quot;form moving in sound&quot; meshed with their own. Associated with them at one time or another were Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Friedrich Gernsheim, Robert Fuchs, and Karl Goldmark, among others.

==Liszt, Wagner, and their followers==
The key figure on the &quot;Weimar (&quot;New German&quot;)&quot; side was Franz Liszt. The other leading composer of the group was Richard Wagner. Other notable figures siding with Liszt were the critic Richard Pohl and composers Felix Draeseke, Julius Reubke, Karl Klindworth, William Mason and Peter Cornelius. The composer and pianist Hans von Bülow supported the Liszt-Wagner side until his wife, Liszt&#x27;s daughter Cosima, left him for Wagner; he then switched his allegiance to Brahms. It was Bülow who called Brahms the third of the Three Bs and dubbed that composer&#x27;s First Symphony &quot;The Tenth,&quot; after Beethoven&#x27;s nine. Pohl, brought by Liszt to serve as Weimar&#x27;s unofficial critic-in-residence, championed Liszt, Berlioz and Wagner in print. He also took Eduard Hanslick to task for claiming music could not be programmatic.

There were several attempts, with Liszt at the centre, to create a lasting and formal society. The &quot;Neu-Weimar-Verein&quot; was one attempt to form a club. It lasted a few years and published minutes of their meetings. The &quot;Tonkünstler-Versammlung&quot; (Congress of Musical Artists), which first met in Leipzig in June 1859, was a more successful attempt at forming an organization. (See New German School.) It eventually led to the founding in 1861 of the &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein&quot; (&quot;ADMV&quot;), the &#x27;United German Musical Union&#x27;, which espoused Liszt&#x27;s musical enthusiasms.

Though Austrian composer Anton Bruckner took no part in the debate between conservatives and progressives, his symphonies were seen as part of the latter due to their advanced harmony, massive orchestration and extended time-scale. His adulation for Wagner, which included the dedication of his Third Symphony and the quotes from Wagner&#x27;s operas incorporated into that work, helped cement this impression.

==Main disagreements==
A central point of disagreement between these two groups of musicians was between traditional and new musical forms. This was an outgrowth of the debate on the viability of the symphony genre, which had grown in the hands of Ludwig van Beethoven from one intended for entertainment to a form that included social, moral and cultural ideals. Liszt and his circle favored new styles in writing and forms that would blend music with narrative and pictorial ideas. Toward this end, and with the motto &quot;New wine required new bottles&quot; in mind, Liszt developed the symphonic poem. The &quot;Leipzig/Berlin school&quot; championed the forms used by the classic masters, forms codified by musicologists such as Adolf Bernhard Marx of the early 19th century.

The validity of &quot;program music&quot; was also a point of contention. In his 1854 book, &quot;Vom Musikalisch-Schönen&quot;, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything specific other than itself. It could suggest realistic impressions in the manner of Hector Berlioz, as well as impressions and feelings, such as those represented by the movement headings in the score of Beethoven&#x27;s Sixth Symphony. This view was not considered novel in itself. &quot;What was new,&quot; according to musicologist and Liszt biographer Alan Walker, &quot;was that [Hanslick] was a musician addressing musicians, and he found a large audience.&quot; Between the first and second of this book&#x27;s nine editions, the first six of Liszt&#x27;s symphonic poems were published and the Faust Symphony premiered under Liszt&#x27;s baton. Hanslick revised his text to mention Liszt and those works specifically.

==The conservatives&#x27; manifesto==
One significant event out of many was the signing of a &quot;Manifesto&quot; against the perceived bias of the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;. This effort, whose author was almost certainly Brahms, received at first four signatures, among them those of Brahms and Joachim, though more were canvassed and eventually more were obtained. Before the later signatories could put their names to the document, however, it found its way into the editorial offices of the &quot;Berliner Musik-Zeitung Echo&quot;, and from there was leaked to the Neue Zeitschrift itself, which parodied it on May 4, 1860. Two days later it made its official appearance also in the &quot;Berliner Musik-Zeitung Echo&quot; with more than twenty signatures, including Woldemar Bargiel, Albert Dietrich, Carl Reinecke, and Ferdinand Hiller.

The manifesto read:

:&quot;The undersigned have long followed with regret the pursuits of a certain party, whose organ is Brendel&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;. &quot;The above journal continually spreads the view that musicians of more serious endeavour are fundamentally in accord with the tendencies it represents, that they recognize in the compositions of the leaders of this group works of artistic value, and that altogether, and especially in northern Germany, the contentions for and against the so-called Music of the Future are concluded, and the dispute settled in its favour&quot;. &quot;To protest against such misinterpretation of facts is regarded as their duty by the undersigned, and they declare that, so far at least as they are concerned, the principles stated by Brendel&#x27;s journal are not recognized, and that they regard the productions of the leaders and pupils of the so-called New German School, which in part simply reinforce these principles in practice and in part again enforce new and unheard-of theories, as contrary to the innermost spirit of music, strongly to be deplored and condemned&quot;.

Signing the manifesto might have caused Joachim some heartache. While he did not care for Liszt&#x27;s music or his promotion of the New German School, he had limited his comments to his friends and musical associates. He did not share them with Liszt until 1857, four years after he had left Weimar. The manifesto became a catalyst for spreading the conflict to the German press at large. Liszt, for his part, did not debate the manifesto; instead, he let his music make his points for him.

==The war==
The &#x27;war&#x27; was carried out through compositions, words, and even with scenes at concerts. At the premiere of Brahms&#x27;s first piano concerto in Leipzig, there was a reversal of sorts. The concerto, which was his first orchestral piece to be performed publicly, was met with hissing. Conservative critics hated the piece, while those who supported the New German School praised it.

Reputations were at stake and partisans sought to embarrass their adversaries with public slights; the Weimar school held an anniversary celebration of the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift&quot; in Schumann&#x27;s birthplace Zwickau and conspicuously neglected to invite members of the opposing party (including Clara Schumann). Musicians on one side saw the dispute as pitting Brahms&#x27; effective and economical sonata and classical forms against some of Liszt&#x27;s works which appeared in comparison almost formless. Those on the other saw, on the Lisztian side, musical form best fitting musical content, pitted against works reusing old forms without any feeling for their growth and reason.

Wagner poked fun at the conservative side in his essay &quot;On Conducting&quot;, when he portrayed them as &#x27;a musical temperance society&#x27; awaiting a Messiah.

The attitudes of the Weimar side were also often inconsistent. By 1859 Liszt himself was becoming more interested in writing church music and embracing the conservative ideals of the Catholic Church. He retained a fascination with the music of Meyerbeer (having composed piano transcriptions of music from his operas), a composer despised by both the New German School and by Wagner (whose 1850 essay &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;, reprinted and extended in 1868, is an anti-Meyerbeer diatribe). Moreover, Liszt&#x27;s concepts of programme music, (e.g. in his symphonic poems), were diametrically opposed to Wagner&#x27;s ideals of music drama as expressed in the latter&#x27;s essay &quot;The Artwork of the Future&quot;.

Although actual hostility between the two sides was to subside over the years, the &#x27;war&#x27; was a clear demarcation between what was seen to be &#x27;classical music&#x27; and &#x27;modern music&#x27;, categories which still persist (although differently defined) to the present day.

<text>Lavender Bay is a harbourside suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Lavender Bay is located three kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of North Sydney Council.

The suburb takes its name from Lavender Bay, a natural feature of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) immediately west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It lies between Milsons Point and McMahons Point. The suburb North Sydney is located, to the north. Lavender Bay is a residential suburb with expansive views of Sydney Harbour.

==History==

Lavender Bay was named after the Boatswain (bosun), George Lavender, from the prison hulk &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which was moored there for many years. The bay is dual-named Gooweebahree, (also sometimes written as Quiberee) in the Dharug language of the local inhabitants, the Cammeraygal people of the Eora nation. The colonists also called it Hulk Bay and sometimes Phoenix Bay. George Lavender lived on adjacent to the property of Billy Blue.
On 30 May 1915 Lavender Bay railway station was opened to take the place of Milsons Point railway station. This only lasted for seven weeks, as passengers refused to alight here and demanded that trains stop at Milsons Point. During the Sydney Harbour Bridge construction, Lavender Bay station was the terminus of the North Shore railway line. The area is now used to stable Sydney Trains rolling stock.

===Heritage listings===

Lavender Bay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 1 Walker Street: Brett Whiteley House

==Population==
In the 2021 Census, there were 870 people in Lavender Bay. 59.4% of people were born in Australia and 75.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.6% and Catholic 23.9%.

==Landmarks==

* A wharf is located in the bay which provides access to private vessels.
* The Lavender Bay Baths (1910), also known as Cavill&#x27;s Baths, a tidal swimming pool, were once popular with swimmers, located in the area beside the ferry wharf.
* Wendy Whiteley created a garden adjacent to her home, in the area between Clark Park and the old railway line. It is sometimes known as Wendy&#x27;s Secret Garden, and is open to the public.

==Churches==
* Christ Church, Lavender Bay, a Lower North Shore landmark.
* The Jesuit Church of St Francis Xavier was founded in 1856 and is now part of North Sydney Parish.

==Notable residents==
* Donald Bradman lived in the harbourfront Bay View Street, and was one of the first few Australians to get a private telephone number while living in Bay View Street.
*Artist Norman Lindsay lived at &#x27;Heidelberg&#x27; at 9 Bay View Street; another artist, John Firth-Smith, occupied this same house many decades later.
* Artist Brett Whiteley lived in a house overlooking the Bay with his wife Wendy Whiteley; Wendy continued to live there . In 2018 the NSW Government granted heritage status to the Whiteleys&#x27; house, its views of Sydney Harbour, and Wendy&#x27;s remarkable Secret Garden in recognition of the significance of the place to the history of Australian art.

<text>Binasal hemianopsia is the medical description of a type of partial blindness where vision is missing in the inner half of both the right and left visual field. It is associated with certain lesions of the eye and of the central nervous system, such as congenital hydrocephalus.

==Causes==

In binasal hemianopsia, vision is missing in the inner (nasal or medial) half of both the right and left visual fields. Information from the nasal visual field falls on the temporal (lateral) retina. Those lateral retinal nerve fibers do not cross in the optic chiasm. Calcification of the internal carotid arteries can impinge the uncrossed, lateral retinal fibers, leading to loss of vision in the nasal field.

Clinical testing of visual fields (by confrontation) can produce a false positive result, particularly in inferior nasal quadrants.

==Management==

==Etymology==
The absence of vision in half of a visual field is described as &quot;hemianopsia&quot;. The absence of visual perception in one quarter of a visual field is described as &quot;quadrantanopsia&quot;.

The visual field of each eye can be divided in two vertically, with the outer half being described as &quot;temporal&quot; or &quot;lateral&quot;, and the inner half being described as &quot;nasal&quot;.

&quot;Binasal hemianopsia&quot; can be broken down as follows:
*&quot;bi-&quot;: involves both left and right visual fields
*&quot;nasal&quot;: involves the nasal visual field
*&quot;hemi-&quot;: involves one-half of each visual field
*&quot;anopsia&quot;: blindness

<doc id="1170526" wikidata="Q6012432" url="?curid=1170526" title="In the Light of Reverence">
<text>In the Light of Reverence (2001) is a documentary produced by Christopher McLeod and Malinda Maynor (Yumbee). It features three tribal nations, Hopi, the Winnemem Wintu, and the Lakota Sioux, and their struggles to protect three sacred sites. Such sites are central to their understanding of the world and their spiritual responsibilities to care for their homelands.

The three stories featured in &quot;In the Light of Reverence&quot; are intended to lead to understanding and dialogue. They were developed with an advisory board composed of Native Americans and were based on personal relationships nurtured for decades.

The three sacred sites, Devils Tower, situated in the Lakota Black Hills; the Four Corners of the Hopi in Arizona; and the Winnemem Wintu&#x27;s Mount Shasta, are places of extraordinary beauty. They have been sites of controversy over differing ideas of how to use the land among American Indians and non-Indians. The Lakota, Hopi, and Winnemem Wintu consider the land sacred. Users such as mining companies, New Age practitioners, and rock climbers think of the land as a material resource best used for industry and recreation.

==Background==
In 1978, the United States Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) which legalized Native American worship practices which had been banned for over a century. While Native Americans tried to use the Act to protect sacred places where they pray, in every instance they lost. In 1988, the Supreme Court overturned two lower court rulings that sided with northern California Indians who were trying to prevent a logging road from going through their sacred &quot;high country&quot; in the Siskiyou Mountains, east of Eureka. It is a place of vision questing and medicine gathering. The Forest Service sought to build a road, or &quot;G-O Road&quot; to gain access to old growth timber.

The loss of the GO Road case sparked a crisis in Indian country, as it appeared that the laws did not protect their sacred sites. The principle of religious freedom could not be extended to protect the sites they needed for worship. In the early 1990s, Native Americans assessed the AIRFA court battles and concluded that the non-Native public had virtually no understanding of what such sacred places meant to Indian communities, why they were important, and how their protection was fundamental to the free exercise of their religions. They chose to develop means of public education.

The conflict over climbing at Devils Tower, Wyoming, escalated into a legal battle in 1997 when Mountain States Legal Foundation and several commercial climbers sued the National Park Service for asking climbers and tourists to respect Native American beliefs about the tower. Christopher McLeod, who had already been filming with the Hopi and Winnemem for five years, decided to add the Devils Tower story &quot;to round out the film geographically, and to include the legal conflict over climbing a sacred site - because ultimately America is a nation of laws, and many value conflicts ultimately are worked out through legal arguments.&quot; The producers contrasted the treatment of Native American places with those important to European Americans: &quot;the fundamental irony of the denial of religious freedom to the first Americans is mirrored in the fact that it is a federal crime to climb the faces of Mount Rushmore.&quot; In total, he and Maynor worked on the film for ten years.

&quot;In the Light of Reverence&quot; is narrated by the Bay Area actor, Peter Coyote, and Tantoo Cardinal of the Métis people. It premiered in San Francisco on February 17, 2001 at the Palace of Fine Arts.

The film received the Best Documentary Feature Award at the American Indian Film Festival in San Francisco, was nationally broadcast on PBS as part of the POV series, on August 14, 2001, and was seen by three million people. In 2005, the Council on Foundations awarded the film the prestigious Henry Hampton Award for Excellence in Film and Digital Media, in recognition of the film&#x27;s influence, its positive reception in Indian Country and its strong distribution history.

&quot;In the Light of Reverence&quot; features interviews with Vine Deloria, Jr. of the Standing Rock Sioux, Florence Jones of the Winnemem Wintu, and Charles Wilkinson.

<doc id="1170552" wikidata="Q2985054" url="?curid=1170552" title="Daphne in the Brilliant Blue">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series animated by J.C.Staff and broadcast on TV Kanagawa from January to July 2004. The anime was originally licensed by Geneon USA. It is now licensed by Sentai Filmworks.

A manga adaptation, illustrated by manga artist Satoshi Shiki titled , was serialized in &quot;Young King OURs&quot; magazine and serves as a prequel to the television series.

==Story==
In the future, water has covered much of the Earth due to the effects of global warming, leaving the human race to live on neighboring floating cities. The orphaned Maia Mizuki, fifteen years of age, just graduated from middle school and has already applied for employment in the elite Ocean Agency, part of the futuristic world government. Only the best, most intelligent, and physically fit students are eligible for admission. Maia, the series&#x27; protagonist, is set to become one of the few.

But her ideal life quickly falls apart. To her disappointment, Maia unexpectedly fails her entrance exams despite her high grades. Making matters worse, she promptly gets evicted from her house, pick pocketed, taken hostage, then shot. She is &quot;saved&quot; by two women (Rena and Shizuka) that are part of an unorthodox help-for-hire organization called Nereids (inspired by the Greek mythological Nereids). With nowhere to go, Maia joins up with Nereids, taking jobs from capturing wanted criminals to chasing stray cats, often with unexpected results. Gloria and Yu later join up with Nereids.

&quot;Daphne&quot;, Greek for &quot;Laurel tree&quot;, in the title refers to the last words said by Maia&#x27;s grandfather. &quot;Brilliant Blue&quot; refers to the fact that this is a world covered by water with almost no land. The world consists of vast oceans, a few islands, and floating cities. This subplot that starts midway into the series concerns Maia&#x27;s journey to retrieve a time capsule of her past buried under a laurel tree in Elpida, an undersea city lost over a century ago.

In almost every episode, there is a recitation of a verse that Maia&#x27;s grandfather taught her. She and others say it whenever her life is difficult or in danger - &quot;A tree that is planted by water will produce fruit in due season, its leaves will never wither...&quot;. It is never identified as Psalm 1:3, &quot;He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.&quot; (NIV)

The manga of the series is a prequel that takes place a century ago when humans were forced to live undersea when the cities were Greek named. Elpida means &quot;hope.&quot; Now they&#x27;re Russian inspired, like Kamchatka. Ai Mayuzumi, Millie&#x27;s great grandmother is the protagonist of the story.

==Characters==
: 
: Maia is the protagonist of the series. She has lost all of her childhood memories, because as a child, Maia was put into a one year coma because of a car wreck. The cause of it was because while in the car with her parents, the controls malfunctioned. Her parents died. Waking up, she was introduced to a man claiming to be her grandfather. In episode 11, Maia tells the girls of Nereids her story of waking up from her coma. During the flashback, Maia asks her grandpa why whenever he smiles at her, he seems sad. At the end of the episode, she is looking at a picture of her grandfather then she asks, &quot;What is it that you were keeping hidden from me, Grandpa.&quot; Although Maia is an excellent student she is rejected by the Ocean Agency, an elite paramilitary organization that is part of the futuristic world government. So instead Maia, broke and homeless, joins Nereids, an unorthodox help-for-hire organization inspired by the Greek mythological Nereids. She is optimistic, hard working, and honest, yet a naive and shy cute girl-next-door. Maia is in search of her past and continues to do so while working with Nereids.
: 
: Leader of the Nereids Kamchatka branch. Rena is capable, elegant, and cunning, although she can be cold at times. Although not the branch manager in title, she is the &quot;de facto&quot; leader and makes the decisions. She is cool and calculating and her sharp instincts enable her to know the weaknesses of other people. Rena has no moral qualms about seducing others for manipulation or for a weapon use. She is also frugal with money and deducts pay from salaries under even the slightest pretext.
: 
: Busty and bespectacled with purple hair, Shizuka is a brilliant mechanic who grew up in an inner city district of Shibuya and knows many people there. She is known for her poor shooting aim and is friendly, casual, and trusting with a voracious appetite for food.
: 
: Loud, spontaneous, tomboyish, and somewhat reckless with a ganguro style complexion, Gloria is a trigger-happy champion marksman and the weapons specialist with a grudge against Rena for deserting her on a past mission. She tends to stick to her guns and loves to shoot things up and she does not get along with Yū. Gloria loves money and bothers Rena about how much she owes her. She is the only character without a regular civilian outfit.
: 
: Silent, brooding, nihilistic, and a loner, Yu is a ridiculously strong fighter and hand-to-hand combat specialist. She had her license revoked in the past for destroying private property and injuring several police officers (including Detective Yagi) and bystanders. She has a loyalty to Rena, but does not get along too well with Gloria, where comically they are usually paired up on assignments, and constantly hits her. Yu&#x27;s interests include animals and travel.
: 
: Maia&#x27;s best friend from her Ocean Agency days who got accepted, despite having average grades. She and Maia had made a promise to work with each other.
: 
: The inept branch manager of the Nereids Kamchatka branch. He gets pushed around by his female co-workers. Hanaoka has a wife and a daughter Yukari.
: 
: Tsutomu Hanaoka&#x27;s daughter. She gets displeased with her father&#x27;s ineptness at times, especially when he lied about being a dashing, bold, detective, but still loves him dearly.
: 
: The chief inspector of the Kamchatka city police force, he gets stressed when it comes to Nereids. One of his biggest burdens is Yu who injured him in the past.
: 
: Shizuka&#x27;s friend (and later Maia&#x27;s) who is a skilled race car driver. She is inspired by her great-grandmother Ai Mayuzumi (the protagonist of the manga version which is a prequel to this story). Ai was Maia&#x27;s father&#x27;s bodyguard.
: 
: Son of their mother&#x27;s fourth husband.
: 
: Son of their mother&#x27;s seventh husband.
: 
: Son of their mother&#x27;s second husband and the oldest of the Wong-Chang-Lee brothers.
: 
: Sister of the Wong-Chang-Lee brothers (the daughter of their mother&#x27;s 14th husband). She is more level-headed and comptetent than they are. She is a martial artist and also wants to find the treasure of Elpida, to which end she stole a submarine (which gets repeatedly confiscated by the Nereids and subsequently stolen again by the family). The submarine was named Agnes for their mother. Shizuka renamed it Yomogi-1.
: 
: A mysterious man in sunglasses who can be seen following Maia throughout the series. In episode 22, as he reveals himself to be a member of the Ocean Agencies Security division, charged with protecting her as seen in a few episodes.
: Shou Mizuki (old) .
: Shou Mizuki (young) 
: Maia&#x27;s Grandfather who raised her after she awoken from her coma five years ago. He tried to help her regain the memories she lost in the supposedly recent accident that claimed her parents. Shown only in flashbacks, he died right before the first episode. His last word to her, &quot;daphne&quot;, refers to a laurel tree in their former home. When Maia uncovered the buried time capsule where the tree once stood in Elpida, Grandpa was revealed to be her big brother. The siblings were placed in hibernation pods over a century ago when their parents and undersea city were quarantined by the Ocean Agency. His pod was found and he was awakened 60 years prior her and he was forced into the government coverup of their prior life. Maia did not age during her slumber.
: 
: Maia&#x27;s father.
: 
: Maia&#x27;s mother.

<text>&quot;Baby Love&quot; is a song by the American music group the Supremes from their second studio album, &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;. It was written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland and was released on September 17, 1964.

&quot;Baby Love&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in the United States from October 25, 1964, through November 21, 1964, and in the United Kingdom pop singles chart concurrently. Beginning with &quot;Baby Love&quot;, the Supremes became the first Motown act to have more than one American number-one single, and by the end of the decade, would have more singles hitting the top slot than any other Motown act (or American pop music group) with 12, a record they continue to hold.

It was nominated for the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Recording, losing to Nancy Wilson&#x27;s &quot;How Glad I Am&quot;. It is considered one of the most popular songs of the late 20th century; &quot;Baby Love&quot; was ranked number 324 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It dropped to number 499 on the 2021 update of the list. The BBC ranked &quot;Baby Love&quot; at number 23 on &quot;The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart&quot;, which ranks Motown releases by their all time UK downloads and streams.

==History==
At the insistence of Berry Gordy hoping for a follow-up chart-topper, Holland–Dozier–Holland produced &quot;Baby Love&quot; to sound like &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;. Elements were reincorporated into the single such as Diana Ross&#x27;s cooing lead vocal and oohing, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson&#x27;s &quot;baby-baby&quot; backup, the Funk Brothers&#x27; instrumental track, and teenager Mike Valvano&#x27;s footstomping. Further, both Ballard and Wilson had brief solo ad-libs towards the end of the song on the released version (after this release Ross would be the only member to have any solos on the 1960s singles).

It was the second of five consecutive Supremes songs to go to number one in the United States, reaching the top spot of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart on October 31, 1964, and staying there for four weeks. The song also reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks before being dislodged by The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, and topped the &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B chart. &quot;Baby Love&quot; and Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Over and &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; are the only American singles that topped the UK charts between 1963 and 1965.

&quot;Billboard&quot; stated that &quot;the swinging harmony style keeps [the song] rolling all the way through.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a heartfelt, steady beat thumper...that the femmes deliver in ultra-commercial fashion.&quot;

&quot;Baby Love&quot; was later included on the soundtrack to the 1975 feature film &quot;Cooley High&quot;.

<text>Huey Lewis and the News is the debut album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released in 1980.

==Background==
In 1979, the band&#x27;s name was Huey Lewis and the American Express. Under this name they released a single and secured their recording contract with Chrysalis Records at the end of the year. The album was recorded within three weeks and the producer was Bill Schnee, who had produced for Boz Scaggs and Pablo Cruise.

Chrysalis did not like the addition &#x27;American Express&#x27; to the band&#x27;s name, fearing that the credit card company of the same name could sue them. In January 1980, the band changed their name to &#x27;Huey Lewis and the News&#x27;.

The album reached No. 203 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the track &quot;Who Cares?&quot; was used in the 1979 motion picture &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; states that producer Bill Schnee mastered the &quot;clean, sparse rock&quot; that every rock band was trying to achieve at the time by &quot;skinning the uptempo, light rockers down to basic guitars and vocals.&quot; In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine says the News turn out &quot;hard-driving covers and originals in a workmanlike fashion&quot; but their &quot;debut suffers from an uneven selection of material.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; called the lead single &quot;Some of My Lies Are True (Sooner or Later)&quot; a &quot;fun rocker&quot; in which &quot;the driving rhythm guitars buttress strong lead and harmony vocals.&quot;

==Track listing==

==Singles==
&quot;Some of My Lies Are True (Sooner or Later)&quot; was written in San Francisco by the band and recorded in Los Angeles within three weeks, and the track was released as the album&#x27;s first single. The song is about people betraying other people, including friends, old friends, and enemies. The B-side for the single was &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;. Videos were shot for both songs and were later included on the band&#x27;s 1985 VHS compilation, &quot;Video Hits&quot;. In 1986, remixes of the songs were included as B-sides to the singles &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; and &quot;Stuck with You&quot;, respectively.

A live recording of the song &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; was later included on the charity album &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

<text>The X-Corporation (X-Corp) is a fictional institution appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men comics. This organization was created to ensure the protection of mutant rights throughout the world due to the increasing number of mutants and widespread bigotry and hate crimes against them.

==Fictional history==
X-Corp was founded by Prof. Charles Xavier, the founder of the X-Men. Its purpose is to provide support for &quot;civilian&quot; mutant populations on a global scale in a world where the mutant population was outgrowing the reach of the X-Men. X-Corp offices are located in many major cities in every continent, and each office is managed by a former member of the X-Men or one of their satellite teams, such as Sunspot or Domino. The worldwide headquarters of the X-Corporation is the X-Mansion. X-Corp works with local governments, such as when they took in the superstrong twelve-year-old orphan Molly Hayes on behalf of the Social Services of Los Angeles.

It should not be confused with the X-Corps, a short-lived paramilitary team led by Banshee, which merged with the X-Corporation after its dissolution, most of its members transferring to the Paris branch.

In the wake of the Decimation of mutantkind, wherein 90-95% of the mutant population was rendered genetically and physically human and thus powerless, several bombings occurred at X-Corporation locales. For the safety of those operating the facilities, and to regroup all empowered members, Cyclops ordered the evacuation of all X-Corp offices and the organization appears to be dead. With the minimal mutant population and the strict government rules imposed on mutants, the organization would serve no purpose.

==&quot;X-Corp&quot; (volume 1)==

A business delegation representing the nation of Krakoa debuted as part of &quot;Reign of X&quot; in 2021. X-Corp will handle the mutantkind&#x27;s business interests and has expanded into two branches:

* X-Corp Pharma: Research, development, and production of Krakoa&#x27;s pharmaceuticals.
* X-Corp Telecom: Development of the Ionospheric Bandwidth Generator for faster communication. The mutant circuit of Vulcan, Bishop, Thunderbird and Sunspot activates the generator.

The Board of Director includes:

* Angel (Warren Worthington III) – Chairperson
* Penance (Monet St. Croix) – CXO
* Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde) – CXO
*Selene – CXO
*Trinary (Shilpa Khatri) – CXO

Other supporting members include Multiple Man, Jumbo Carnation and Wind Dancer (Sofia Mantega).

<doc id="1170558" wikidata="Q18091480" url="?curid=1170558" title="The Doll Family">
<text>The Doll Family was an American quartet of sibling entertainers with dwarfism from Stolpen, Germany. They were popular performers in circuses and sideshows in the United States from the mid-1910s until their retirement in 1958. The family members—Gracie, Harry, Daisy and Tiny—also appeared briefly in films; they were best known as members of The Munchkins in the 1939 MGM film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Harry and Daisy, billed as Harry Earles and Daisy Earles respectively, both starred in the cult classic film &quot;Freaks&quot;; Tiny also made a brief appearance in the film.

==Members==
== History ==
=== Early years ===
The Doll family were four of seven children born to Amelia Emma Preusche and Gustav Schneider in Stolpen, Germany. They were encouraged by their father to work in the entertainment field, taking advantage of their &quot;hypopituitary&quot; status.

Kurt and Frieda were the first to migrate to California in 1916, after they met Bert W. Earles and his wife, who became their agents. The Earles had toured with the Dancing Dolls family prior to becoming actors under new names. Kurt and Frieda changed their names to Harry and Grace to act in films, and they adopted the surname Earles of their manager. Their first dance appearance was for the Buffalo Bill Show in the roles as &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, for which they were hailed as the &quot;Smallest Dancing Couple in the World&quot;. Hilda, who later came to be known as Daisy Earles, joined her brother and sister in California in the early 1920s. Another sister, Elly, joined them in 1926; she was called &quot;Tiny&quot; because of her appearance. All four siblings, who had earlier taken the surname Earles, changed it to &quot;Doll&quot; after the death of their manager, Earles.

At this time, the Dolls began touring with Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, where they sang, danced and rode horses and wagons for the next 30 years. Daisy soon earned the nickname &quot;Midget Mae West&quot; and was often billed as such.

Franz Taibosh, an Afrikaner with the circus, had a crush on Daisy Earles, but she was not interested. She was already married to the family&#x27;s chauffeur and bodyguard.

===Film roles===
The Doll family had a brief tenure in film, Harry was the first to begin a film career, and also had the most prolific career in the genre. His first film was Tod Browning&#x27;s Lon Chaney vehicle &quot;The Unholy Three&quot; (1925) as the ruthless Tweedledee. He reprised the role for the 1930 sound remake, again with Chaney, but this time directed by Jack Conway. The family also began appearing in films together, almost always as circus performers, and acted in some comedies with Laurel and Hardy. Harry and Daisy were cast in major roles in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s 1932 film &quot;Freaks&quot;, while Tiny had a small part.

However, the 1932 film was considered horrifying, and was shown in the U.S. with many cuts, banned in England, and in Canada was called &quot;brutal and grotesque&quot;. In fact, Harry himself brought to Browning&#x27;s attention the Tod Robbins story &quot;Spurs&quot; on which elements of the film were based.

In 1928, Daisy Earles had appeared in the 1928 film &quot;Three-Ring Marriage&quot;. All four siblings performed as &quot;Munchkins&quot; in a song and dance sequence along the Yellow Brick Road in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Harry played a minor featured part as a member of the Lollipop Guild, who welcome Dorothy upon her arrival in Oz. They were not credited individually in the film, but as part of the larger group of &quot;The Singer Midgets&quot;, despite having been generally well known in their own careers as &quot;The Doll Family&quot;.

The family&#x27;s opportunities as film actors had always been limited, by both their size and their German accents, and they stopped appearing in films, although Daisy played a small part in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; in 1952. They returned to the traveling sideshows. The Dolls toured with the Christiani Circus after the Ringling Circus was sold in 1956. They retired two years later.

===Personal lives and later years ===

The Doll family were close-knit, and always lived, ate and worked alongside one another, with the exception of Daisy&#x27;s brief marriage in 1942, to an average-sized man, which ended in divorce less than a year later.

Their decades with the circus had provided the siblings with a good living, and they bought a house in Sarasota, Florida, in which all four lived. The house, which was often featured in magazines, was furnished with custom-built reduced-size furniture. On the grounds of the house was a &quot;Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, which the family opened to the public. Each of the four remained living in the house until their deaths. Tiny was the last survivor; she died in 2004 after a long illness and many years living alone, after Harry&#x27;s death in 1985.

<doc id="1170565" wikidata="Q77522" url="?curid=1170565" title="Winx Club">
<text>Winx Club is an animated children&#x27;s television series co-produced by Rainbow SpA and later Nickelodeon. It was created and directed by Italian animator Iginio Straffi. It premiered on 28 January 2004, becoming a ratings success in Italy and on Nickelodeon networks internationally. The show is set in a magical universe that is inhabited by fairies, witches, and other mythical creatures. The main character is Bloom, a girl of Earth planet who discovered to be a fairy and enrolls at Alfea College to train and hone her skills. In Alfea she makes friends with four other fairies with whom she founds a group called &quot;Winx Club&quot; and together with them she fights a long series of enemies who threaten the Magic Dimension, discovering in the process her true origins and the fate of her biological family. The series uses a serial format with an ongoing storyline.

Iginio Straffi initially outlined the show&#x27;s plot to last three seasons. He chose to continue the story for a fourth season in 2009. Around this time, &quot;Winx Club&quot;″s popularity attracted the attention of the American media company Viacom, owner of Nickelodeon. Viacom purchased 30% of the show&#x27;s animation studio, RainbowSpA, and Nickelodeon began producing a revival series. Production on the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons was divided between Rainbow and Nickelodeon Animation Studio. To attract an American audience, Viacom assembled a voice cast of Nickelodeon actors (including Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande), invested in advertising for the series, and inducted &quot;Winx Club&quot; into Nickelodeon&#x27;s franchise of Nicktoons.

Beginning in 2010, episodes of &quot;Winx Club&quot; were jointly written with Nickelodeon&#x27;s American team. Nickelodeon&#x27;s writers aimed to make the series multicultural and appealing to viewers from different countries. In 2019, Straffi commented on his years of collaboration with Nickelodeon, saying that &quot;the know-how of Rainbow and the know-how of Nickelodeon are very complementary; the sensibilities of the Americans, with our European touch.&quot; The continued partnership between Rainbow and Nickelodeon on &quot;Winx Club&quot; led to the development of more co-productions, including &quot;Club 57&quot; in 2019, on which much of &quot;Winx Club&quot;″s staff worked.

The series was subject to budget cuts in 2014, during its seventh season; the 3D computer-generated segments and Hollywood voice actors were deemed too costly. The seventh season eventually premiered on Nickelodeon&#x27;s worldwide channels in 2015. After a four-year hiatus, an eighth season premiered in 2019. At Straffi&#x27;s decision, this season was heavily retooled for a preschool target audience.

A live-action adaptation of &quot;Winx Club&quot; for young adults, titled &quot;&quot;, premiered in 2021. In January 2023, Viacom (now known as Paramount Global) sold its stake in Rainbow SpA back to Straffi, allowing him full control of the studio&#x27;s new projects, including an upcoming animated reboot of the &quot;Winx Club&quot; franchise.

== Premise ==
The series follows the adventures of a group of six girls known as the Winx, students at the Alfea College for Fairies. The team is made up of Bloom, the Fairy of the Dragon Flame; Stella, the Fairy of the Shining Sun; Flora, the Fairy of Nature; Tecna, the Fairy of Technology and Musa, the Fairy of Music. In the second season Aisha, the Fairy of Waves, became the sixth member of the group. The main male characters are the Specialists, a group of students at the Red Fountain school who are also the Winx fairies&#x27; boyfriends. They include Bloom&#x27;s boyfriend Sky; Stella&#x27;s boyfriend Brandon; Flora&#x27;s boyfriend Helia; Tecna&#x27;s boyfriend Timmy; and Musa&#x27;s boyfriend Riven. Unlike their female counterparts, the Specialists do not have magical powers and instead, train how to fight using laser weapons. In the third season, the wizard Nabu, Aisha&#x27;s boyfriend, is added to the group of boys. The Winx and Specialists&#x27; most common adversaries are a trio of witches named the Trix: Icy, Darcy, and Stormy, all former students of the Cloud Tower school. 

&quot;Winx Club&quot; is set in a vast universe with several dimensions. Most episodes take place in the Magic Dimension, which is closed off to ordinary people and inhabited by creatures from European mythology like fairies, witches, and monsters. The capital of this world is the city of Magix—which is located on the planet of the same name—where the three main magic schools are situated. The other planets of the Magic Dimension include Bloom&#x27;s home planet Domino, Stella&#x27;s home planet Solaria, Flora&#x27;s home planet Lynphea, Tecna&#x27;s home planet Zenith, Musa&#x27;s home planet Melody, and Aisha&#x27;s home planet Andros. Some episodes take place on Earth, where Bloom spent her childhood.

== Development ==
=== Concept and creation ===
During the 1990s, comic artist Iginio Straffi noticed that most action cartoons were focused on male heroes; at that time, he felt that the &quot;cartoon world was devoid of female characters&quot;. Straffi hoped to introduce an alternative show with a female lead aged 16 to 18, as he wanted to &quot;explore the psychological side&quot; of the transition to adulthood. He decided to develop a pilot centred on the conflict between two rival colleges; one for fairies and another for witches. Straffi compared his original premise to &quot;a sort of &#x27;Oxford–Cambridge rivalry&#x27; in a magical dimension&quot;. In expanding the concept, Iginio Straffi drew his inspiration from Japanese manga and the comics of Sergio Bonelli.

Straffi&#x27;s pilot, which was titled &quot;Magic Bloom&quot;, featured the original five Winx members in attires like those of traditional European fairies. It was produced during a twelve-month development period that included animation tests, character studies, and market surveys. The animation attracted the interest of Rai Fiction, which paid for 25% of the production cost in exchange for Italian broadcast rights and a share of the series&#x27; revenue over 15 years. After holding test screenings of the pilot, however, Straffi was unhappy with the audience&#x27;s unenthusiastic reaction to the characters&#x27; outdated clothing style and stated that the pilot did not satisfy him. In a 2016 interview, Straffi said the result &quot;looked like just another Japanese-style cartoon ... but nothing like [the modern] &quot;Winx&quot;&quot;. He likened his feelings about the pilot to an &quot;existential crisis&quot; and chose to scrap the entire test animation despite an investment of over in the completed pilot.

To rework the concept, Straffi&#x27;s team hired Italian fashion designers to restyle the show and give the characters a brighter, more modern appearance. Production of the restyled series began by 2002, and Rainbow estimated the episodes would be delivered to distributors by late 2003. The new name of the series (&quot;Winx&quot;) was derived from the English word &quot;wings&quot;. Straffi&#x27;s aim was to appeal to both genders, including action sequences designed for male viewers and fashion elements for female viewers. At the October 2003 MIPCOM event, Rainbow screened the show&#x27;s first episode to international companies. The first season had its world premiere on Italian television channel Rai 2 on 28 January 2004.

From the beginning of development, Iginio Straffi planned an overarching plot that would end after &quot;a maximum&quot; of 78 episodes. Straffi stated that the &quot;Winx&quot; saga &quot;would not last forever&quot; in 2007, and he intended the first movie (&quot;Winx Club: The Secret of the Lost Kingdom&quot;) to resolve any plot points remaining from the third-season finale. In 2008, Straffi decided to extend the series, citing its increasing popularity.

=== Nickelodeon revival ===
In September 2010, Rainbow S.p.A. announced they had entered into a worldwide broadcast and production deal with Nickelodeon that would see the broadcaster air the series in several territories, alongside co-producing and developing seasons five and six with them, effectively reviving the series. Nickelodeon Consumer Products also secured merchandising rights to the revival in some regions, including the United States. Viacom would finance and staff the revived series, dividing production between Viacom&#x27;s Nickelodeon Animation Studio in the United States and Rainbow S.p.A. in Italy.

In February 2011, Nickelodeon&#x27;s parent company Viacom acquired a 30% stake in Rainbow S.p.A. for 62 million euros (US$83 million). Viacom originally planned to buy out the entire Rainbow studio, but wanted to keep Iginio Straffi at the helm, leaving Straffi with 70%.

The revived series began with four special episodes that summarize the first two seasons of the original show, followed by the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. As the production team was divided between two countries, Nickelodeon released a statement commenting on how &quot;Winx Club&quot; was an unusual production for the company: &quot;It&#x27;s not our usual practice to co-produce cartoons; we make them by ourselves. But we strongly believe in &quot;Winx&quot;.&quot; &quot;Winx Club&quot; was officially inducted into Nickelodeon&#x27;s franchise of Nicktoons, a brand that encompasses original animated productions created for the network. On each episode of the revived series, Nickelodeon approved scripts and all phases of animation. Nickelodeon brought on some of its long-time staff members, such as creative director Janice Burgess, and writers Sascha Paladino, Adam Peltzman, and Carin Greenberg.

On 7 April 2014, Rainbow and Nickelodeon announced their continuing partnership on the seventh season of &quot;Winx Club&quot;, with a planned premiere date of 2015. Straffi said of the season: &quot;It will be a privilege to partner once more with Nickelodeon on this.&quot; During production, Rainbow was undergoing a multimillion-euro financial loss due to the box office failure of its film &quot;Gladiators of Rome&quot;. They subsequently decided to cut costs on &quot;Winx Club&quot;, its most expensive show. The CGI-animated segments and California voice cast from the previous two seasons were deemed too costly to continue using for the seventh season. As with the previous two seasons, the copyright to the seventh season is co-owned by Rainbow and Viacom. The first episode aired on 22 June 2015, on Nickelodeon in Asia, followed by its American broadcast on the Nick Jr. Channel on 10 January 2016.

The president of Nickelodeon International, Pierluigi Gazzolo, was responsible for arranging the co-production partnership and became a member of Rainbow&#x27;s board of directors. In addition to financing the television series, Viacom provided the resources necessary to produce a third &quot;Winx&quot; film. In 2019, Iginio Straffi commented on the two studios&#x27; near-decade of continued work together, saying that &quot;the know-how of Rainbow and the know-how of Nickelodeon are very complementary; the sensibilities of the Americans, with our European touch.&quot; &quot;Winx Club&quot; opened the opportunity for Nickelodeon and Rainbow to collaborate on additional co-productions together, including various pilots from 2014 onward and &quot;Club 57&quot; in 2019.

==== Retooled eighth season ====

The eighth season of the series was not produced immediately after the seventh. It followed a multiple-year hiatus and was not made as a direct continuation of the previous season. At Iginio Straffi&#x27;s decision, Season 8 was heavily retooled to appeal to a preschool target audience.

For season eight, Rainbow&#x27;s creative team restyled the characters to appear younger, hoping to increase the appeal toward preschoolers. The plot lines were simplified so that they could be understood by a younger audience. Most of the show&#x27;s longtime crew members were not called back to work on this season, including art director Simone Borselli, who had designed the series&#x27; characters from season one to seven, and singer Elisa Rosselli, who had performed a majority of the songs. In another change from previous seasons, season eight was the first since season four to be solely produced by Rainbow, with Nickelodeon&#x27;s American team serving as consultants rather than directly overseeing the episodes. This was due to the broadcaster focusing on another co-production with Rainbow – &quot;Club 57&quot;. Season eight was also the first-ever season without the involvement of Rai Fiction.

Iginio Straffi made the decision to shift the show&#x27;s intended audience after years of gradually aiming toward a younger demographic. In a 2019 interview, Straffi explained that decreasing viewership from older viewers and an increased audience of young children made this change a necessity. He elaborated that &quot;the fans of the previous &quot;Winx Club&quot; say on social media that the new seasons are childish, but they don&#x27;t know that we &quot;had&quot; to do that.&quot; Straffi stepped away from the series at this time and shifted his focus to live-action projects aimed at older audiences: Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Club 57&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Straffi explained that &quot;the things we had to tone down [in season eight] have been emphasized in the live action–the relationships, the fights, the love stories.&quot; He added that he hoped that &quot;Fate&quot; will satisfy the &quot;20-year-olds who still like to watch &quot;Winx&quot;.&quot;

===Reboot===
On November 6, 2022, creator Iginio Straffi announced that &quot;a brand new CG &quot;Winx&quot; animated series reboot is going into production. Yes, a reboot.&quot; In January 2023, Paramount (Viacom) sold its stake in Rainbow back to Straffi, allowing him full creative control of the reboot. In May 2024, it was announced that Netflix will be in charge of broadcasting the episodes.

== Production ==
=== Design ===
The series&#x27; visuals are a mixture of Japanese anime and European elements, which Iginio Straffi calls &quot;the trademark Rainbow style&quot;. The main characters&#x27; original designs were based on Straffi&#x27;s original sketches and later updated to 3D CGI iterations. The main characters were modelled on celebrities popular at the turn of the 21st century. In a 2011 interview with &quot;IO Donna&quot;, Straffi stated that Britney Spears served as an inspiration for Bloom, Cameron Diaz for Stella, Jennifer Lopez for Flora, Pink for Tecna, Lucy Liu for Musa, and Beyoncé for Aisha. This approach was part of Straffi&#x27;s aim for the fairies to represent &quot;the women of today&quot;.

A team of specialized artists designs the characters&#x27; expressions and outfits for each season. About 20 tables of expressions and positions from all angles are drawn for each character. The designers start to develop characters&#x27; costumes by creating collages from magazine clippings of recent fashion trends. Using these as references, they draw multiple outfits for each character. Simone Borselli, the series Winx art director, designed most of the characters&#x27; early-season clothing despite lacking a background in fashion design. When asked by an interviewer where his fashion intuition came from, Borselli responded, &quot;From being gay&quot;.

=== Writing and animation ===
The first stage in the production of an episode is developing its script, a process that can last 5–6 months. When the series began production, the writers were based entirely in Italy. After Viacom became a co-owner of Rainbow in 2011, Rainbow&#x27;s group of 30 writers began collaborating with teams in both Italy and the United States. The international coordination, which has continued through 2019, intends to make scenarios depicted in the program multicultural and accessible to viewers from different countries. Episodes are written with two stories in mind: a longer narrative arc that lasts for tens of episodes and a subplot that concludes at the end of the 22-minute runtime. This episode structure was modelled on those of teen dramas and American comics. Themes written into the series include romance, the acquisition of maturity upon reaching adulthood, and (in the fifth season) nature conservation.

After the script and character designs have been approved, the screenplay is passed onto a group of storyboard artists. For each 22-minute episode, the artists prepare 450 pages of storyboards which are used to assemble an animatic. At this stage, dialogue and music are added to determine the length of each scene. In the original series (seasons 1–4), the characters&#x27; mouths were animated to match the Italian voice actors&#x27; lines; in the revived series, the mouth movements were matched to the English scripts. Episodes are worked on concurrently because each requires around two years of work to complete.

At the beginning of the first season, the production team worked from Rainbow&#x27;s original headquarters in Recanati. In 2006, Straffi opened a second studio in Rome for computer-animated projects. During the fifth and sixth seasons, 3D CGI sequences were incorporated into the series for the first time, animated at the studio in Rome. According to the Rainbow CGI animators, the animation of the characters&#x27; hair in underwater scenes was particularly difficult, and it was animated separately from the characters.

=== Casting ===
In Italy, the series&#x27; voice actors include Letizia Ciampa (Bloom), Perla Liberatori (Stella), Ilaria Latini (Flora), Domitilla D&#x27;Amico (Tecna), Gemma Donati (Musa), and Laura Lenghi (Aisha). According to Ilaria Latini, the characters were cast before the character designs were finalized and the actors were shown black-and-white sketches of their roles. The actors record their lines in Rome. Seasons 1–4 were animated to match the Italian voices. Starting with season 5, the animation was synchronized to match the English scripts.
The 2011 specials introduced a new cast of Hollywood voice actors. Iginio Straffi himself helped to choose the voices of the main characters, and the actors recorded their lines at the Atlas Oceanic studio in Burbank, California. Molly Quinn voiced the lead role of Bloom, and at first, she tried out a cartoony voice for her character. Nickelodeon advised her to use her real voice instead, saying, &quot;No, we want voices of real girls this time around.&quot;

For the 2011 cast, Viacom hired popular actors whose names were advertised on-air to attract American viewers; these stars included Ariana Grande as Diaspro, Elizabeth Gillies as Daphne, Keke Palmer as Aisha, Matt Shively as Sky, and Daniella Monet as Mitzi. These actors provided voices for the first two &quot;Winx&quot; films and seasons three through six. In 2014, Viacom relocated the series&#x27; English cast to DuArt in New York City; this was done as a cost-cutting and time-saving measure since Rainbow was undergoing a significant financial loss at the time. Despite the change in voice actors, the series&#x27; animation continued to be matched to Nickelodeon and Rainbow&#x27;s English scripts for the seventh season.
=== Music ===
Original songs have been recorded in about 40 languages for the show. Frequent composers for the program include Michele Bettali, Stefano Carrara, Fabrizio Castania, and Maurizio D&#x27;Aniello. One of Nickelodeon&#x27;s composers, Emmy and Grammy Award recipient Peter Zizzo, joined the team during Nickelodeon&#x27;s joint production of the fifth season. His music is featured in the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. Each song takes between five and twelve months to complete. Many of the show&#x27;s tracks are performed by Italian singer Elisa Rosselli, who started recording songs for &quot;Winx&quot; in 2007. Rosselli continued to produce music for the show (usually in collaboration with D&#x27;Aniello or Peter Zizzo from Nickelodeon) until its seventh season.

Nickelodeon created a few live-action music videos for &quot;Winx Club&quot; that were performed by stars from other Nick shows. One featured Elizabeth Gillies from &quot;Victorious&quot; (who also voiced Bloom&#x27;s sister, Daphne) singing &quot;We Are Believix.&quot; This song was released as a stand-alone single on iTunes. Another music video featured Cymphonique Miller from &quot;How to Rock&quot; singing &quot;Winx, You&#x27;re Magic Now.&quot; Miller also did a live performance of her &quot;Winx&quot; song at Nickelodeon&#x27;s upfront presentation in Las Vegas.

== Broadcast ==
&quot;Winx Club&quot; first premiered on the Italian television channel Rai 2 on 28 January 2004. Reruns later aired on Rai Gulp, a sister channel to Rai 2 aimed at children, shortly after the network launched in 2007.

By 2014, the show had been aired in over 150 countries. In 2019, after the Viacom-CBS merger announcement, Informa&#x27;s &quot;Television Business International&quot; listed the show among the most important Viacom properties internationally.

In June 2022, Paramount (the rebranded name of ViacomCBS) launched a 24-hour &quot;Winx Club&quot; channel on their Pluto TV on-demand service. The channel is currently only available on the Spanish and French feeds.
===Revival series===
On 2 September 2010, Nickelodeon announced through a press release that they would be producing brand-new seasons with Rainbow. Nickelodeon debuted four one-hour specials (also co-produced with Rainbow) summarizing the first two seasons, the first of which premiered on their flagship American channel on 27 June 2011. With the exception of Italy, the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons launched on Nickelodeon channels domestically and internationally.

During the sixth season in 2014, episode premieres were moved from Rai 2 to Rai Gulp in Italy, and from Nickelodeon to the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States. The change to younger-skewing networks followed Rainbow&#x27;s lowering of &quot;Winx Club&quot;″s target demographic to a younger audience than the earlier seasons. The seventh season was jointly announced by Nickelodeon and Rainbow in April 2014 as part of their continuing partnership. The seventh season made its world premiere on Nickelodeon Greece on 24 May 2015, and the English version debuted on Nickelodeon Asia on 22 June 2015. It later premiered on Rai Gulp in Italy (21 September 2015) and the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States (10 January 2016).

===4Kids edit===
In October 2003, 4Kids Entertainment acquired US broadcast rights to the first season of &quot;Winx Club&quot; for broadcast on their FoxBox (later 4Kids TV) strand on Fox. 4Kids dubbed the first three seasons, censoring and editing the original content in an attempt at localization. Iginio Straffi criticized these adjustments in a 2008 interview, saying, &quot;The Winx fairies cannot even talk about boys there. I think this removes something essential.&quot; The series last aired on The CW (as part of The CW4Kids) before 4Kids&#x27; broadcast agreement was permanently revoked by Rainbow in 2009.

== Reception ==
=== Ratings ===
Upon its debut, &quot;Winx Club&quot; was a ratings success. During its first season in 2004, the series became one of the highest-rated programs on Rai 2 with an average audience share of 17%. Among viewers 4–14 years old, the average share was 45%. In France and Belgium, the season reached a 56% share among 10 to 14-year-olds. According to Rai in 2009, the gender mix of &quot;Winx Club&quot; audience was nearly equal across the first three seasons; in the target demographic of 4–14 years of age, females represented only 3% more of the audience than males. The premiere of the fourth season set a record for an animated show&#x27;s audience on Rai 2 with 500,000 viewers. In 2007, Iginio Straffi noted that there were lower ratings in English-speaking territories than in Europe at the time, which he surmised was due to cultural differences.

On 27 June 2011, the first special produced with Nickelodeon premiered on Nick U.S. to 2.278 million viewers. Each of the following three specials performed better than the previous ones, with the fourth (&quot;The Shadow Phoenix&quot;) rating #1 in its time slot among viewers aged 2–11. During the first quarter of 2012, an average of 38.5 million viewers watched the series across nine of Nickelodeon&#x27;s international outlets, a 60% increase from the fourth quarter of 2011. On Nickelodeon UK, &quot;Winx Club&quot; increased the network&#x27;s ratings by 58% on its launch weekend in September 2011, ranking as the second-most-popular program on the channel and the most popular show with females aged 7–15. As of 2021, &quot;Winx Club&quot; is still broadcast daily on Nickelodeon UK&#x27;s main network.

=== Critical response ===
In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Bocconi University professor Paola Dubini stated that the themes and characters of &quot;Winx Club&quot; appealed to both the target audience and their parents. Dubini wrote that the fairies&#x27; &quot;defined and different personalities&quot; made them relatable to viewers. Common Sense Media reviewer Tara Swords gave the show a three-star review, calling it &quot;an imaginative story with bold, take-charge heroines&quot; while also arguing that the show is hindered by its design elements.

&quot;Winx Club&quot; has attracted academic interest for its presentation of gender roles. In the journal of Volgograd State University, Russian sociologists Georgiy Antonov and Elena Laktyukhina judged that female characters in the series are depicted as dominant, while males are shown to be passive. As examples of women adopting traditionally male roles, they listed the female fairies fighting for their boyfriends, saving them from enemies, and inviting them on dates, while at the same time having difficulty performing household duties like cooking and cleaning. Writing for Kabardino-Balcarian State University, Zalina Dokhova and Tatiana Cheprakova stated that the series conveys &quot;both positive and negative stereotypes&quot;, citing the opposite personalities of Stella and Aisha. They wrote that Stella&#x27;s character incorporates stereotypically feminine passions for shopping and clothes, while Aisha represents a more realistic character with an interest in male-dominated sports.

Rhodes University professor Jeanne Prinsloo wrote in 2014 that &quot;Winx Club&quot; episodes &quot;present complex narratives with active female protagonists and positive relationships that validate &#x27;girl power&#x27;&quot;. In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, psychotherapist Gianna Schelotto highlighted positive aspects of the show, like friendship, guiding female viewers &quot;away from supermodels to which the commercial world drags them&quot;. &quot;IlSole 24 Ore&quot; also wrote positively about the show&#x27;s feminist themes, commending how the characters &quot;expose narcissistic masculinity&quot;.

The characters&#x27; outfits caused some controversy in June 2017, when the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) fined Nickelodeon&#x27;s Pakistani channel after it aired an episode where the Winx are shown in swimsuits.

=== Cultural impact ===
&quot;Winx Club&quot; has been popular at fan conventions. For example, in 2012 and 2013, the series had a large presence at Nickelodeon&#x27;s San Diego Comic-Con booth, where new collectibles were raffled off to fans. Nickelodeon made two exclusive dolls for the 2012 event (a silver Bloom and a gold Bloom) and two more for 2013 (Daphne in her nymph form and Bloom in her Harmonix form). In 2015, a four-day &quot;Winx Club&quot; fan gathering was held in Jesolo, where Nickelodeon installed a &quot;Fan Wall&quot; to display messages from worldwide fans. In October 2018, an exhibition for the series&#x27; fifteenth anniversary was held at Europe&#x27;s largest comics festival, the Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention in Tuscany.

Federico Vercellino of &quot;Il Sole 24 Ore&quot; described the series as &quot;a destructive and constructive phenomenon&quot; that introduced viewers to feminist stories about rebellious female characters. A 2019 study conducted for the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; reported that &quot;Winx Club&quot; was the fourth-most-popular Italian series outside of the country, with strong demand in Russia and the United States.

In 2018, Giovanna Gallo of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; stated that the program&#x27;s characters have become &quot;real icons of fashion&quot; and noted the show&#x27;s popularity with cosplayers, performance artists who wear costumes and accessories to represent the show&#x27;s characters. &quot;Winx Club&quot; costumes were the focus of a second-season episode of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, in which Flavio Briatore challenged the show&#x27;s teams to create three &quot;Winx&quot; outfits intended for females 25–35 years of age, which were to be submitted to the judgment of Iginio Straffi. &quot;la Repubblica&quot;″s Marina Amaduzzi attributed the popularity of &quot;Winx&quot;-inspired fashion to fans&#x27; desire to emulate the characters, stating that &quot;Winx fanatics dress, move and breathe like their heroines&quot;.

The Regional Council of Marche, Italy, chose the &quot;Winx Club&quot; fairies to represent Marche and Italy at the Expo 2010 world&#x27;s fair in Shanghai. A four-minute video using stereoscopic technology showing the Winx in Marche&#x27;s tourist destinations was animated for the Italian Pavilion. In 2015, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi visited Rainbow&#x27;s studio and wrote that &quot;the Winx are a beautiful story of Italian talent&quot;.

== Lawsuit ==
In April 2004, The Walt Disney Company filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit against Rainbow. The company accused Rainbow of copying the &quot;Winx Club&quot; concept from its &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; comic book, which was published over a year after production on &quot;Winx Club&quot; began. Disney applied for an injunction order to halt the further release of the &quot;Winx Club&quot; series and comic magazine; to declare the &quot;Winx Club&quot; trademark invalid; and to seize the periodical and film material bearing the allegedly infringing &quot;Winx Club&quot; name. Rainbow won the case against Disney, and the judge declared there were no confusing similarities between the two. Straffi mentioned that the &quot;Winx Club&quot; pilot entered production by 2000, while the &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot; comic was not released until May 2001. On 2 August 2004, all of Disney&#x27;s infringement claims were rejected by the Tribunale di Bologna&#x27;s Specialized Commercial Matters Department, which deemed them unfounded. The suit later became the subject of a commercial law seminar at the University of Macerata in 2009.

In 2005, Iginio Straffi was interviewed in &quot;IO Donna&quot; about the legal battle. He was asked how it felt &quot;to be one of Disney&#x27;s most hated people,&quot; and answered that he—as the founder of a small animation studio—was glad to have &quot;defeated&quot; a massive conglomerate. &quot;I feel a certain pride in having annoyed such a giant. It&#x27;s inspiring,&quot; he elaborated. As a result of the lawsuit, Straffi has avoided doing any business with the Disney corporation; he commented in 2014, &quot;They&#x27;ve lost the chance to explore our creativity.&quot;

=== Films ===
==== &quot;The Secret of the Lost Kingdom&quot; ====

On 8 October 2006, a &quot;Winx Club&quot; feature film was announced on Rainbow&#x27;s website. &quot;The Secret of the Lost Kingdom&quot; was released in Italy on 30 November 2007. Its television premiere was on 11 March 2012 on Nickelodeon in the United States. The plot takes place after the events of the first three seasons, following Bloom as she searches for her birth parents and fights the Ancestral Witches who destroyed her home planet. Iginio Straffi had planned this feature-length story since the beginning of the series&#x27; development.

==== &quot;Magical Adventure&quot; ====

On 9 November 2009, a sequel film was announced. &quot;Winx Club 3D: Magical Adventure&quot; was released in Italy on 29 October 2010. Its television premiere was on 20 May 2013, on Nickelodeon in the United States. In the film, Sky proposes to Bloom, but Sky&#x27;s father does not approve of their marriage. Production on &quot;Magical Adventure&quot; began in 2007, while the first film was still in development. It is the first Italian film animated in stereoscopic 3D.

On February 19, 2013, Nickelodeon held a special screening of the movie at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Nickelodeon star Daniella Monet (who voiced Bloom&#x27;s rival, Mitzi, on the show) and creator Iginio Straffi both attended the premiere.

==== &quot;The Mystery of the Abyss&quot; ====

In late 2010, it was announced that Viacom (the owner of Nickelodeon and eventual co-owner of Rainbow) would provide the resources necessary to produce a new &quot;Winx&quot; film. The film, titled &quot;Winx Club: The Mystery of the Abyss&quot;, was released in Italy on 4 September 2014. It made its television premiere on Nickelodeon Germany on 8 August 2015. The plot follows the Winx venturing through the Infinite Ocean to rescue Sky, who has been imprisoned by the Trix. According to Iginio Straffi, the film has a more comedic tone than the previous two films.

=== Spin-offs ===
&quot;PopPixie&quot; is a miniseries that ran for a single season over two months in 2011. It features chibi-inspired Pixie characters who were first introduced in the second season of &quot;Winx Club&quot;. After Nickelodeon became a co-developer of the main series, it was announced that &quot;PopPixie&quot; would air on Nickelodeon&#x27;s global network of channels beginning in late 2011.

&quot;World of Winx&quot; is a spin-off series that premiered in 2016. Straffi described it as one &quot;with more adult graphics, a kind of story better suited to an older audience&quot; than the original series. It features the Winx travelling to Earth on an undercover mission to track down a kidnapper known as the Talent Thief. 26 episodes over two seasons were made.

=== Netflix live-action adaptation ===

In 2018, a live-action adaptation aimed at young adults was announced. Filming began in September 2019, with Abigail Cowen starring as Bloom. The series made its world premiere on 22 January 2021, following a teaser released on 10 December 2020. In February 2021, the series was renewed for a second season, which was released on 16 September 2022. In November 2022, the series was canceled after two seasons.

The writers of &quot;Fate: The Winx Saga&quot; were entirely new to the &quot;Winx&quot; franchise, and they were recruited from teen dramas like &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. Early in production, Nickelodeon&#x27;s American crew members from the cartoon (including Bloom&#x27;s voice actress, Molly Quinn) met with the &quot;Fate&quot; production team and reviewed the pilot script. Rainbow&#x27;s Joanne Lee also oversaw the show as an executive producer.

=== Live-action movie ===
In November 2022, Iginio Straffi announced that, along with the reboot of the animated series, a new live-action film was in development.

=== Reboot animated series ===
In April 2024, Rainbow announced a &quot;brand new&quot; &quot;Winx Club&quot; animated series coming in 2025, exclusively on Netflix.

In October 2024, Rainbow debuted the first image and official teaser trailer for the reboot series.

=== Other live events ===
In September 2005, a live stage musical called &quot;Winx Power Show&quot; began touring in Italy. The musical later expanded to other European countries and the show&#x27;s cast performed at the 2007 Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards in Milan. An ice show follow-up starring Carolina Kostner was launched in November 2008. In October 2012, Nickelodeon held a live event at the Odeon Cinema Covent Garden, complete with a &quot;pink carpet&quot; and previews of upcoming episodes.

=== Merchandise ===
Iginio Straffi opened up to licensing &quot;Winx Club&quot; merchandise in order to finance his studio&#x27;s other projects; in 2008, he stated that he reinvests &quot;almost everything&quot; back into Rainbow. Across the show&#x27;s first ten years on air, more than 6,000 pieces of tie-in merchandise were released by external licensing companies. As of 2014, &quot;Winx Club&quot; merchandise licenses generated around annually, with most of the revenue going toward product licensees rather than Rainbow itself. According to a &quot;VideoAge International&quot; article, Rainbow&#x27;s take from merchandise sales averages 10 percent, with some deals only giving the studio five percent.

After Viacom became a co-owner of Rainbow in 2011, Nickelodeon &amp; Viacom Consumer Products started to create merchandise for the show. From 2011 to 2013, Nickelodeon spent on a &quot;Winx Club&quot; marketing campaign to promote both the show and the tie-in products. Nickelodeon partnered with Jakks Pacific to design dolls based on new episodes, and in the United Kingdom, the merchandise sold out before those episodes had even premiered. Nickelodeon&#x27;s vice president of consumer products, Michael Connolly, said that &quot;&quot;Winx&quot; has been a huge surprise, considering the program is not on free-to-air in the UK. We put toys in Argos [stores] and in just three days we experienced sales for a doll range unlike we&#x27;ve seen.&quot;

An ongoing comic book series has been published since the series&#x27; premiere. Over 210 Italian issues have been released as of 2021. In the United States, Viz Media translated a few of the first 88 issues and released them across nine volumes. Other tie-in books have been produced, starting with character guides distributed by Giunti Editore. In 2012, Nickelodeon partnered with Random House to publish &quot;Winx Club&quot; books in English.

=== Games ===

Several video games based on the show have been made, with some exclusive to Europe. The first game was Konami Europe&#x27;s &quot;Winx Club&quot; in 2005. In 2012, Nickelodeon launched &quot;Winx Club: Magical Fairy Party&quot; for the Nintendo DS in both the United States and Europe. The Nickelodeon game was notable for being one of very few Nintendo DS titles to be played sideways, with the game system held like a book. A physical trading card game based on the franchise and produced by Upper Deck Entertainment was released in 2005.

Nickelodeon&#x27;s website, Nick.com, created various Flash games based on the show. The &quot;Winx Club&quot; section on Nick.com became one of the most-visited pages on the site, with 1 million monthly visitors in mid-2013 and over 2.6 million gaming sessions.

<text>Benjamin Grant Ferguson (born August 28, 1981) is an American cable television talk show host and a radio talk show host on 600WREC/Memphis, TN. His radio show originates from his home in Texas. His nationally syndicated radio show, &quot;The Ben Ferguson Show&quot;, airs throughout the United States Sunday nights on Radio America and is syndicated by ICON Radio Network. Since 2018, his show &quot;The Ferguson File&quot; has aired middays on CRTV, which in December 2018 merged with BlazeTV to form Blaze Media. He is also a regular political commentator on CNN.

==Early life and education==
Ben Ferguson was born to Bruce and Karen Ferguson on August 28, 1981. He has an older sister, Holly. Ferguson was homeschooled by his mother in Memphis, TN through the tenth grade. Ben has Scottish ancestry. A local talk-radio host throughout his teens, Ferguson attended Tusculum College, but later, graduated from Westminster Academy. He went on to the University of Mississippi, intending to play tennis; he became a member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He graduated from Ole Miss in 2004. Ben married Anna Bradley Ferguson in March 2010.

==Political activities==
Ferguson is a member of Students for Saving Social Security (S4). In July 2005, as S4&#x27;s political director, Ferguson was selected by the White House to join President Bush and Ben Stein for a town hall meeting in an effort to educate the public on the issue of social security reform. Ferguson also spends several weeks a year on the road speaking at youth leadership conferences, high schools and college campuses nationwide. He has become a regular keynote speaker for several groups, including Congressional Youth Leadership and Lead America.

Ferguson is an avid critic of former Memphis Mayor W. W. Herenton. When Herenton resigned and then decided to run again for mayor not two weeks later, Ferguson entered the political scene and pulled a petition to run for Memphis City Mayor. He withdrew from the election when Herenton also withdrew.

== Broadcasting career ==
At 13, Ben Ferguson became the youngest radio talk show host in the country, and the youngest nationally syndicated host at 20. Ferguson published his first book, a political work, “It’s My America Too,” published by William Morris/Harper Collins in 2004 which USA Today named a “top choice read.” 

In August 2007, Ferguson joined 600 WREC in Memphis as its morning radio host. He was then moved to the afternoon drive show from 4 to 7pm CT.[4] On April 20, 2010, Ferguson resigned from WREC. In a statement he said, &quot;I have left the station, effective today. I’m looking forward to a new market and a new show, in addition to my national show and my continuing appearances on such networks as CNBC, CNN and MSNBC.&quot;

Later, it was stated that Ferguson left WREC after an impasse in contract negotiations. It was then announced that Ben Ferguson would take over the 4–7pm slot on another local radio station, KWAM. Controversial radio host Thaddeus Matthews was fired to make room for Ferguson.

On April 1, 2012, Ferguson became the regular fill-in for Mark Davis on WBAP in Texas, as Davis was involved in contract disputes with the new owners of WBAP, Cumulus Media. When a new contract could not be reached between Mark Davis and Cumulus, Ferguson became the permanent host of the 9–11am CT time slot. Ben currently lives in Dallas, Texas.[5]

Ferguson&#x27;s national talk-radio show focuses on current events from a conservative point of view. The Ben Ferguson Show can be heard over ICON Radio Network weekly on Sunday evenings from 7 to 10pm ET.

Ferguson hosted a local radio show in Memphis during evening drive time slot (from 4 to 7pm) weekdays on WREC (600 AM) in Memphis until April 20, 2010. On May 3, 2010, KWAM 990 announced that he would be their new evening drive time host. On April 25, 2011, Ben moved to WKIM 98.9 FM, coinciding with a format change in the station to an all-talk network.

In late 2018, Ferguson moved to CRTV, the channel founded by Mark Levin&#x27;s Conservative Review, to host a midday talk show called &#x27;The Ferguson File&#x27;. In December of that year, CRTV merged with Glenn Beck&#x27;s BlazeTV to form Blaze Media, and Ferguson&#x27;s show moved to the new combined channel, which is carried by numerous cable systems across the country as well as streamed online. In January 2021, Ferguson announced a podcast deal with Premiere Networks that allowed his show to be part of the iHeartRadio podcast network.

He also appears frequently on Fox News Channel, MSNBC, CNBC, Fox Business, CNN, and CNN Headline News.

=== 2004 presidential election ===
At 21, Ferguson addressed a small crowd of young Republicans at the Republican National Youth Convention advocating for youth turnout during the 2004 election. Also during his speech, Ferguson attacked Michael Moore, noted that young people were fighting the War on Terror, and made attacks on the media.

<text>&quot;Come See About Me&quot; is a 1964 song recorded by the Supremes for the Motown label. The track opens with a fade-in, marking one of the first times the technique had been used on a studio recording.

The song became third of five consecutively released Supremes songs to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in the United States (the others being &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, &quot;Baby Love&quot;, &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot;). It topped the chart twice, non-consecutively, being toppled by and later replacing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; in December 1964 and January 1965. The BBC ranked &quot;Come See About Me&quot; at #94 on &quot;The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart&quot;, which ranks Motown releases by their all time UK downloads and streams.

==History==

===Overview===
&quot;Come See About Me&quot; was written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland. It was recorded during a two-week period in which the Supremes also cut &quot;Baby Love&quot;, after &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; became their most successful single to date. It was #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for two separate weeks: December 13, 1964, to December 18, 1964, and January 10, 1965, to January 16, 1965, and reached #3 on the soul chart. 

&quot;Billboard&quot; said the song has a &quot;pronounced Detroit beat, steady and exacting&quot; and that the &quot;gals weave silky and controlled vocal through beat.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a pulsating stomp-a-rhythmic… that the gals carve out in ultra-commercial manner&quot; and in which the group was &quot;in top-of-the-chart form.&quot;

The Supremes were the first to record the song, but not the first to issue it as a single. That distinction fell to Nella Dodds: her version climbed to #74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but Motown quickly released the Supremes&#x27; version as a single, which killed Dodds&#x27; sales. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described Dodds&#x27; version as &quot;an exciting pop-r&amp;b, choral-backed handclap-shuffler about a gal who pleads for her ex-boyfriend to return to her,&quot; hailing the singer as &quot;a new talent who promises to be an important wax name in the coming weeks&quot;.

The Supremes made their first of 17 appearances live on the popular CBS variety program &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, performing this single on Sunday, December 27, 1964.

The group also recorded a German version of the song, entitled &quot;Johnny und Joe&quot;.

&quot;The words had a real sad weight,&quot; observed Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke, &quot;but the music was bouncy. Great!&quot;

==Other versions==

* The Supremes recorded a German-language version of the song, titled &quot;Jonny und Joe&quot; as the b-side of the 1965 single &quot;Thank You Darling&quot; (also sung in German) in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. &quot;Jonny und Joe&quot; was later included on two various Motown artists compilation albums &quot;Motown Around the World&quot; (1987, 1CD) and &quot;Motown Around the World: The Classic Singles&quot; (2010, 2CD) and also on Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes compilation &quot;50th Anniversary: The Singles Collection 1961–1969&quot; (2011, 3CD).
* In 1967, the song was a repeat hit for Motown act Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars, whose version reached the top 10 on the R&amp;B chart and the top 25 on the pop chart.
* In 1987, Welsh rock and roll singer Shakin&#x27; Stevens covered it on his album &quot;Let&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, making it a hit in the UK and Ireland. Shakin&#x27; Stevens version surpassed the Supremes&#x27; original #27 chart placing by reaching #24.
* In 2012, American musical dramedy &quot;Glee&quot; featured a cover of this song for its fourth season&#x27;s Thanksgiving episode. The cover was recorded by Dianna Agron as her character Quinn Fabray with Naya Rivera and Heather Morris providing backup vocals.

<text>James Matthew Hood (born May 15, 1962) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 39th Attorney General of Mississippi from 2004 to 2020.

Hood was first elected Attorney General in 2003, defeating Republican Scott Newton. A former district attorney, Hood succeeded fellow Democrat Mike Moore. Hood announced on October 3, 2018, that he would run for Governor of Mississippi in 2019; he easily won the Democratic primary on August 6, 2019 but lost the general election to then-Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves on November 5, 2019, which was Hood&#x27;s first statewide loss. No Democrat has won a statewide election in Mississippi since Hood won his final term as Attorney General in 2015. He is the last Democrat to hold statewide office in Mississippi, and from 2008 to 2020 was the only one to do so.

Since leaving office, Hood has joined the national law firm Weisbrod Matteis &amp; Copley, establishing the firm&#x27;s first Mississippi-based office in Houston, Mississippi. He also sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center.

==Early life and education==
Hood is the son of James Hood, Jr. Hood is a native of New Houlka in Chickasaw County in northeastern Mississippi.

In 1988, Hood received his J.D. degree from the University of Mississippi at Oxford. As an undergraduate, he was a member of Pi Kappa Alpha.

==Attorney General==
Hood was sworn-in as attorney general on January 8, 2004.

In 2004, Hood prosecuted Jeremy Martin, a teacher from Tupelo, Mississippi and unsuccessful Republican candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives, who was accused of a misdemeanor campaign finance violation. John Helmert, Hood&#x27;s opposing counsel, called the prosecution of Martin a &quot;political witch hunt&quot;. According to the Sun Herald, &quot;it is rare for the state&#x27;s attorney general to prosecute alleged campaign finance violations.&quot; The case was dismissed after the defendant paid a $300 fine.

In 2005, Hood prosecuted former Klansman Edgar Ray Killen for orchestrating the 1964 murders of Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, and James Chaney in Philadelphia, Mississippi during Freedom Summer.
Hood has been active in the legal aspects of the recovery of Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina. Shortly after Katrina, Hood partnered with Mississippi plaintiff attorney Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Scruggs, a brother-in-law of former U.S. Senator Trent Lott, in filing suit against numerous high-profile insurance companies. Hood&#x27;s leadership has been praised by some as allowing homeowners a better opportunity for recovery than they experienced in neighboring Louisiana, but Scruggs and Hood have also been criticized for over-zealously prosecuting insurance companies and because Scruggs helped convey confidential documents, which Hood used in a criminal probe, supposedly to pressure State Farm Insurance into settlement. Hood was reelected on November 6, 2007 and again for a third term on November 8, 2011. On November 3, 2015 Hood was reelected for his fourth term.

In 2008, Judge William Acker criticized Hood in a judicial opinion for his role in helping Scruggs commit civil contempt. Scruggs was later convicted in federal court of crimes committed during the post-Katrina litigation. The saga is recounted in the 2009 book, &quot;Kings of Tort&quot;.

As a prosecutor, Hood has tried more than 100 jury cases while serving as assistant state attorney general and as Chickasaw County District Attorney (D.A.). He has successfully prosecuted several historic cases, including winning the conviction of Killen. As D.A., he successfully prosecuted death penalty cases, including one in which he originally won a conviction, and later, as Attorney General (A.G.), argued and won an appeal of the case before the United States Supreme Court. As A.G., Hood established a vulnerable adults unit, a domestic violence unit, an identity theft unit, and a crime prevention and victims services division. He has launched initiatives to prevent workplace and school violence, and stalking and domestic assault. Hood has developed and distributed numerous publications to assist and educate both consumers and other public service entities in areas such as cyber crime, consumer protection, domestic violence, victims&#x27; assistance, election, and government law.

===Forensics===
Hood has been criticized for his support for the controversial bite mark technique and more generally for his opposition to reform of the Mississippi death investigation system and critical evaluation of questionable forensic techniques.

===Pardons===
On his last day as governor in 2012, Haley Barbour granted 208 pardons, clemency or early release for people convicted of crimes including murder, rape and armed robbery. Barbour&#x27;s actions included 19 people convicted of murder. Pardons by governors are not uncommon; the issue in this case is the number of pardons compared to former governors. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, whom Barbour succeeded as governor, issued only one pardon, for a man convicted of marijuana possession; Gov. Kirk Fordice, who preceded Musgrove, issued two full pardons for convicted murderers.
In his role as attorney general, Hood argued Section 124 of the Mississippi Constitution says any inmate seeking a pardon must publish their intentions 30 days in a newspaper in or near the county where the person was convicted and on January 11, a Mississippi judge temporarily blocked the release of the 21 inmates who had been given pardons or medical release.

=== Notable lawsuits ===

==== 2017 Hurricane Katrina insurance lawsuits ====
In May 2017, twelve years after Hurricane Katrina, Hood filed lawsuits against Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco Insurance claiming that the companies failed to make adequate payments for the victims of Katrina.

Hurricane Katrina occurred in August 2005 and caused $125 billion in property damage within Mississippi.

The lawsuits claim that the insurance companies &quot;undervalued claims for Katrina winded damages to minimize payments and to foist the financial burden onto the state when adjusting homeowners&#x27; insurance claims in the wake of the hurricane.&quot; Part of the complaint read, &quot;Liberty Mutual essentially converted a program designed to help Mississippians recovering from Katrina into a subsidy for itself.&quot;

==== Pharmaceutical companies ====
In 2017, Hood filed lawsuits against a number of pharmaceutical companies. In the lawsuits, Hood alleged that the companies were engaging in an unlawful scheme to &quot;force the state to pay for drugs that were not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement.&quot; Overall, Hood filed six separate lawsuits against the 18 defendant companies.

Among other things, the lawsuits claimed that the companies made the state of Mississippi pay for drugs that had not received approval by the FDA. According to &quot;Legal NewsLine&quot;, &quot;Hood contends the companies&#x27; scheme involves false representations, made by the defendants to the state, that their National Drug Codes, or NDCs, are FDA approved and eligible for Medicaid reimbursement.&quot;

Hood said that the allegedly fraudulent marketing of drugs by the defendant companies resulted in an increased market share and profits for the companies while &quot;essentially leaving the state in a lurch.&quot;

====Department of Corrections corruption====
On February 8, 2017, Hood announced he had filed civil cases against numerous corporations and individuals who had allegedly engaged in corrupt contracts with the Mississippi Department of Corrections and its former Commissioner Chris Epps, seeking damages and punitive damages. He stated, &quot;The state of Mississippi has been defrauded through a pattern of bribery, kickbacks, misrepresentations, fraud, concealment, money laundering and other wrongful conduct.&quot; He continued, &quot;These individuals and corporations that benefited by stealing from taxpayers must not only pay the state&#x27;s losses, but state law requires that they must also forfeit and return the entire amount of the contracts paid by the state. We are also seeking punitive damages to punish these conspirators and to deter those who might consider giving or receiving kickbacks in the future.&quot; Besides Teresa Malone and Carl Reddix, who had been indicted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, the civil case defendants included previously uncharged Michael Reddix; Utah&#x27;s Management &amp; Training Corporation; Florida&#x27;s GEO Group, Inc.; Cornell Companies, Inc.; Wexford Health Sources, Inc.; Drug Testing Corporation; Global Tel*Link Corporation and Sentinel Offender Services, L.L.C. and others. As he left office, Hood published a list of enumerated recoveries of $26,612,188.22 from complicit corporations.
The settlement amounts paid by these government contractors and the nature of services they provided were as follows:
(1) Management &amp; Training Corporation $5.18 million For-profit operator of correctional facilities
(2) Cornell Companies, Inc. (GEO Group) $4.55 million For-profit operator of correctional facilities
(3) Wexford Health Sources, Inc. $4.00 million Correctional health care provider
(4) Keefe Commissary Network, LLC $3.10 million Commissary management services
(5) C. N. W. Construction Company $3.10 million Construction
(6) Global Tel*Link Corporation $2.50 million Inmate telephone communications
(7) Branan Medical Corporation $2.00 million “Drugs-of-abuse” testing products
(8) Sentinel Offender Services, LLC $1.30 million Offender tracking and monitoring provider
(9) CGL Facility Management, LLC $750,000.00 Correctional maintenance services
(10) AdminPros, LLC $32,188.22 Medicaid eligibility services
(11) Guy E. “Butch” Evans $100,000.00 Insurance
(12) Health Assurance, LLC ($0 due to bankruptcy) Correctional health care provider.

==Google investigation==

Working with the National Association of Attorneys General and Entertainment lobby groups, Hood has been pushing Google since 2013 to prevent use of the company&#x27;s search engine to find drugs that require a prescription and copyright infringing content. In December 2014, Google sued Hood in federal court, seeking to block a 79-page subpoena from the attorney general for violating First and Fourth Amendments rights. The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss Google&#x27;s motion on January 12, 2015. Both parties later agreed to freeze their motions and not enforce the subpoena until March 6, 2015. A U.S. District Judge granted Google&#x27;s request for a preliminary injunction on March 2, 2015 putting on hold the pending subpoena and ordering Attorney General Hood to hand over information requested by Google. An appeals court has overturned the preliminary injunction on procedural grounds and allowed the subpoena, though it also criticized the broad nature Hood&#x27;s original subpoena and the lack of any specific associated investigation. In July 2016, Google and Hood agreed to dismiss their respective lawsuits and subpoenas. The Attorney General and Google agreed to &quot;endeavor to collaborate in addressing the harmful consequences of unlawful and/or dangerous online content&quot;.

On December 19, 2014, as a result of the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, emails were released that showed that Hood was urged by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to blame Google for acts of copyright infringement committed by numerous, multiple unrelated third parties via the trade organisations the Digital Citizens Alliance and FairSearch. The released emails also showed that threatening communications from Hood&#x27;s office to Google were written by MPAA counsel.

The subject sued Google for education privacy violations in 2017 and joined other Attorneys General investigating Facebook&#x27;s policies on user privacy by sending a letter to preserve information that might be legal evidence in a future lawsuit.

==2019 gubernatorial campaign==
Hood announced that he would be a candidate for Governor of Mississippi in 2019 on October 3, 2018. According to the &quot;Jackson Free Press&quot;, Hood, &quot;known for his conservative positions on criminal justice... laid out a progressive policy agenda on taxes, health care, education and infrastructure&quot; when he announced his candidacy. Hood campaigned as a moderate Democrat according to an &quot;NPR&quot; reporter. Mississippi&#x27;s &quot;The Clarion Ledger&quot; reported that &quot;Hood portrays himself&quot; as a moderate.

In announcing his candidacy, Hood called for Medicaid expansion, tuition-free community college, universal pre-school, and criticized corporate tax cuts implemented by Mississippi&#x27;s Republican-controlled legislature. According to Hood, the decision by Republicans not to accept Medicaid expansion had contributed to the closure of rural hospitals in Mississippi. He has also campaigned based on what he describes as his anti-abortion views and has highlighted his gun ownership. Explaining his anti-abortion position, he referred to his work defending Mississippi&#x27;s ban, known as a &quot;heartbeat&quot; bill, on abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy.

Hood won the Democratic primary with 68.78% of the vote. He lost the general election to Republican nominee Tate Reeves, the incumbent Lieutenant Governor. Reeves defeated Hood in the general election by a margin of 5.1%, making it the nearest a Democrat had come to winning a Mississippi gubernatorial election since 1999. Hood had managed the strongest performance by a Democrat since the 2003 Mississippi gubernatorial election, when then-incumbent governor Ronnie Musgrove took 45.81% of the vote as he lost reelection.

<text>Rod Ellis is a Kenneth W. Mildenberger Prize-winning British linguist. He is currently a research professor in the School of Education, at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. He is also a professor at Anaheim University, where he serves as the Vice president of academic affairs. Ellis is a visiting professor at Shanghai International Studies University as part of China’s Chang Jiang Scholars Program and an emeritus professor of the University of Auckland. He has also been elected as an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

==Education==
Ellis began his post-secondary education at Nottingham University where he obtained an undergraduate degree. He received a Master of Arts from the University of Leeds, a Master of Education from the University of Bristol, and a doctorate from the University of London.

== Career ==
After obtaining his undergraduate degree, Ellis moved to Spain where he taught at a Berlitz language school before returning to London to teach at an elementary school. In 1967, Ellis moved to Zambia where he taught for 3 years. Following his first masters degree, Ellis returned to Zambia as a teacher trainer. Ellis then went on to teach linguistics and TESOL at St. Mary&#x27;s College in London.

Ellis taught as a professor at Temple University in Japan until 1993 when he relocated to Temple University in Philadelphia. He taught here for 5 years before filling a professorship position at the University of Auckland in New Zealand where he established the University of Auckland&#x27;s English Language Academy.

He has held university positions in six countries and has also conducted numerous consultancies and seminars throughout the world.

==Research==
During his 30 years of research, Ellis has authored and co-authored more than 40 distinct publications. His published work includes articles and books on second language acquisition, language teaching and teacher education. His latest book is Becoming and Being an Applied Linguist (John Benjamins). Other recent publications include Language Teaching Research and Language Pedagogy in 2012 (Wiley-Blackwell), Exploring Language Pedagogy and Second Language Acquisition Research in 2014 (with Natsuko Shintani) (Routledge) and Understanding Second Language Acquisition 2nd Edition in 2015 (Oxford University Press).

He has also published several English language textbooks, including Impact Grammar (Pearson: Longman).

He is a leading theorist of task-based language learning, and has published two books and more than a dozen articles on the subject.

His research interests include: Second language acquisition, individual learner differences, form-focused instruction, teacher education, course design and methodology of language teaching.

== Task-Based Language Teaching ==
A leading theorist in his field of study, Ellis has focused much of his research on task-based language teaching (TBLT). In defining a task, Ellis draws off the definitions provided by others scholars (namely David Nunan and Graham Crookes) by focusing on the successful conveyance of language.

Ellis defines the key features of a task as being:

# A workplan: there is a set of teaching materials and activities which are designated for the learning process.
# A primary focus on meaning: there is a gap of communication or reason that must be filled through interaction. Students are given the freedom to use the language of their choosing rather than focusing on grammatical form. 
#A real world process of language: the task can take the form of an interaction that is likely or less than likely to happen in the real world. The language process should exhibit real-world communication. 
#One that involves any of the four languages skills (reading, writing, listening or speaking). 
#One that engages cognitive processes: students must utilize cognitive processes through their engagement with the task, such as ordering, analyzing and selecting. 
#A clearly defined communicative outcome: the goal of the activity includes a non-linguistic negotiation for meaning.
In his explanation of a task, Ellis careful to illustrate its contrast with an activity, with the former being primarily meaning focused and the latter placing more emphasis on form. This distinction also affects the role of each participant, as a task requires students to act as language users. Alternatively, an activity requires the students to act as language learners.

== 10 Principles of Instructed Language Learning ==
Through his research, Ellis has worked to provide comprehensive guidance for language teachers. Ellis maintains that despite the theoretical contributions made by Stephen Krashen, Robert DeKeyser, Michael Long and Bill VanPatten to the field of second language acquisition, there is no agreement on form-focused instruction or corrective feedback. In 2004, he compiled a set of 10 principles of instructed language learning that have been considered and challenged by other SLA scholars.

These principles include:

# instruction must enlarge the student&#x27;s use of formulaic expressions while maintaining a focus on rule-based competence. 
# instruction must ensure meaning-focused input and output.
# instruction must ensure that students also focus on form.
# instruction must aim to create a balance between implicit and explicit knowledge of the language.
# Instruction must account for the student&#x27;s built-in syllabus (noting the Natural approach to learning developed by Stephen Krashen). 
#Instruction must include extensive L2 input. 
#Instruction must include opportunities for output. 
#Interaction with the language is the basis of proficiency-building. 
#Instruction must consider the individual differences of learners. 
#Assessment should include both free and controlled production.
The basis for this list is grounded in various theoretical perspectives, though namely the computational model of L2 learning developed by James Lantolf. This model has its limitations according to Ellis, as it does not account for social relations and contexts. However, it provides an appropriate basis for establishing a set of principles for language instruction.

== Form-Focused Instruction versus Meaning-Focused Instruction ==
Ellis maintains that the distinction between form-focused instruction and meaning-focused instruction lies in how language is perceived and the role of the student. The former is concerned with drawing the student&#x27;s attention to linguistic form (including, but not restricted to, vocabulary and grammar) whereas the latter focuses on conveying messages.

In taking note of the reconceptualization of focus-on-form by other scholars, notably Michael Long, Catherine Doughty and Jessica Williams, Ellis distinguishes between planned and incidental focus on form. According to Ellis, there are three types of form-focused instruction:

# Focus on forms: can be implicit or explicit, can include structured input or production practice and it can include functional language practice. 
#Planned focus on form: can include enriched input or a focused communicative task.
#Incidental focus on form: can be pre-emptive or reactive; can include implicit negative feedback or explicit negative feedback.

The effectiveness of form-focused instruction depends on multiple variables, such as the linguistic items being taught, the learners&#x27; developmental stage, the instructional context and instructional materials. Ellis also maintains that form focused instruction not only facilitates language learning, but also that it does not change the sequence of language development.

== Corrective Feedback ==

In a 2006 study, Ellis found that groups of students who had been given explicit instructions and grammar rules prior to taking multiple tests at different times initially had different outcomes based on what was being assessed, but by the final test, there was little to no difference between the groups of students. In the same study, Ellis argues that students may already possess certain knowledge of a language&#x27;s grammar, but when shown how to use this internal knowledge correctly, the acquisition of the language can dramatically increase.

Ellis argues in favour of explicit feedback rather than implicit feedback, such as recasts. Accordingly, with the latter, there is positive evidence, though it is not clear whether it provides negative evidence. Ellis supports consciousness-raising as a method for self-correction. Ellis suggests that explicit corrective feedback can be useful in the syntactic and other grammatical understandings in the target language by asserting and demonstrating the type of mistake produced in an utterance. Ellis states that by giving students explicit corrective feedback on mistakes, there is the possibility of students internalizing this new grammatical knowledge being learned for future usage. One reason, as mentioned previously, is that after given the explicit feedback, it allows students to witness the grammatical mistakes being made and self-correct the mistake, allowing for the learner to acquire grammatical knowledge of the language.

== Criticism ==
As a leading theorist in task-based learning (TBL), Ellis has defended TBL from an assertion by Henry Widdowson that the definition of a task is too loose and tends to blur with the concept of an activity. Ellis refutes this claim by explaining that he clearly distinguishes a task from an activity in his works. One of the main ways in which Ellis distinguishes a task from an activity is by arguing the usefulness of each in regard to communication fluency for a task and correct form usage for an activity. Ellis has also contested Paul Seedhouse who argued that such a method could result in pidginized language, to which Ellis claims that it depends on the nature of the task. This method of teaching (TBLT) has been considered by William Littlewood as too difficult for beginner students. The view that Littlewood has against Ellis&#x27;s TBLT method is that the required knowledge of the target language must already be at a fairly proficient level in order to complete the tasks being carried out. Ellis explains that this is true on the basis that it is a production task; other gap-fill activities can be used by beginners.

Ellis further explains that TBLT can be as effective as other methods of teaching a second language whereby the learner may reflect upon their first language as a guide when completing tasks to strengthen comprehension levels in their second language. Michael Swan, protests Ellis in this regard by claiming that TBL is not any more effective than other language teaching methods, since TBL is lacking the structure needed to explicitly teach grammar to learners. Swan claims, that due to this lack of a systemic or clear breakdown for structure, that Ellis&#x27; TBL is more theoretical in nature due to lack of evidence in effect toward language acquisition in students. Another scholar, David Block, praises Ellis&#x27; task-based method as being inventive, however, similarly to Swan, Block defines Ellis&#x27; approach to language teaching heavily theoretical, with Ellis not mentioning how long a TBLT course should be or the maximum number of students it can support in a single class.

<doc id="1170592" wikidata="Q1966202" url="?curid=1170592" title="FOCAL (programming language)">
<text>FOCAL (acronym for Formulating On-line Calculations in Algebraic Language, or FOrmula CALculator) is an interactive interpreted programming language based on JOSS and mostly used on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP series machines.

JOSS was designed to be a simple language to allow programs to be easily written by non-programmers. FOCAL is very similar to JOSS in the commands it supports and the general syntax of the language. It differs in that many of JOSS&#x27; advanced features like ranges and user-defined functions were removed to simplify the parser. Some of the reserved words (keywords) were renamed so that they all start with a unique first letter. This allows users to type in programs using one-character statements, further reducing memory needs. This was an important consideration on the PDP-8, which was often limited to a few kilobytes (KB).

Like JOSS, and later BASICs, FOCAL on the PDP-8 was a complete environment that included a line editor, an interpreter, and input/output routines. The package as a whole was named &quot;FOCAL-8&quot;, which also ran on the PDP-5 and PDP-12. When ported to the PDP-11, the resulting &quot;FOCAL-11&quot; relied on the underlying operating system, RT-11, to provide file support and editing. The language definition was updated twice, to &quot;FOCAL-69&quot; and a very slightly modified &quot;FOCAL-71&quot;. A port to the Intel 8080 was also available.

FOCAL is notable as the language in which the original versions of the early video games &quot;Hamurabi&quot; and &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; were written. Both were later ported to BASIC, where they became much better known. FOCAL was not popular outside the PDP platform and largely disappeared during the move to the VAX-11. It had a strong revival in the Soviet Union where PDP-11 clones were used as educational and home computers (BK series).

==History==
=== JOSS ===

JOSS was released in May 1963 on the one-off JOHNNIAC computer at RAND Corporation. In RAND, use grew rapidly, and the machine, originally built in 1953, quickly ran out of capability. JOHNNIAC was decommissioned in 1966 and JOSS was reimplemented on a newly purchased PDP-6, Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s (DEC) first &quot;big&quot; machine. Use continued to grow and by 1970, the system was being used by 500 to 600 users across the country and had spawned several innovations such as mobile computer terminals that could be wheeled from room to room and plugged in for quick access.

JOSS was highly influential. It emerged just as time-sharing was being introduced. There was significant interest in man-machine interaction and computers were seeing wider use. Whereas most time-sharing operating systems of the era concentrated on user account and file management, leaving the users to do their own programming, JOSS provided file editing and a programming language in one package. RAND showed the system to a parade of people in the industry.

===FOCAL===
The PDP-6 was DEC&#x27;s first mainframe, and JOSS took full advantage of its power and memory capacity. DEC programmers were interested in JOSS, but most of their machines had nowhere near the power needed to run it. Written by Richard Merrill, FOCAL removed features from JOSS as required in order to be able to run in the much more limited memory space of the PDP-8 and other 12-bit machines in the DEC lineup. To achieve this, a major change was made to reduce the amount of temporary data, or &quot;state&quot;, needed to parse the statements. One noticeable effect of this decision was that conditionals could only be used for branches, in contrast to JOSS, where conditionals can be applied to any statement.

The other noticeable change was to rearrange the keywords so each started with a unique letter. This simplified the parser, which needed to read only the first letter of the command on a line of code, and could then skip forward to the next whitespace character. It would then compare that against an internal list of possible keywords, which was one character per entry. In contrast, JOSS had to continue reading until it had read the entire command word and then compared that against a list containing complete words. Not only did this change save memory in the parser, users could also save memory by typing in only that letter, reducing the size of the source code.

The first version of FOCAL was released in 1968 for the PDP-8. An updated version followed the next year, which was later known as FOCAL-69. The system as a whole, regardless of version, was known as FOCAL-8 when it was ported to other machines in the 12-bit series, including the PDP-5 and PDP-12. It was popular as it was highly efficient in memory use, which was often severely limited on these machines to a few kilobytes (KB). The similar FOCAL-11 ran on the PDP-11 under RT-11.

Processor Technology also offered a version of 8k FOCAL, complete with Lunar Lander, for the Intel 8080-based Altair 8800 system. This was provided for the copying charge of the tape, while the source code was provided for free with other purchases.

===BASIC===
While FOCAL was becoming popular on DEC machines, BASIC was becoming a more popular alternative on other platforms. By the late 1960s, several companies were making inroads in DEC&#x27;s minicomputer stronghold, selling similar machines running time-sharing versions of BASIC. Notable among these was the HP 2100 series, running HP Time-Shared BASIC.

David H. Ahl had recently joined DEC&#x27;s PDP-8 Group, just as the company became interested in selling the machine into educational settings. Due to the popularity of BASIC in the education market, especially with the growing library of BASIC programs from the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, Ahl found selling the machine with FOCAL was difficult despite its advantages. As he later noted:

Ahl took it upon himself to produce a BASIC system for the platform, hiring a company he later learned was a single programmer in Brooklyn to produce a version for the 4 kWord PDP-8. DEC began selling packaged versions of the PDP-8 with terminals and the BASIC as the &quot;EduSystem&quot; lineup, with larger systems in the series having expanded versions of BASIC, and in some cases, also FOCAL and FORTRAN. Some PDP-11 based EduSystems were also created.

Ahl then began porting programs from FOCAL to BASIC, notably &quot;The Sumer Game&quot; (which he renamed &quot;Hamurabi&quot;), a version of &quot;Lunar Lander&quot;, and many smaller FOCAL demos. Combining his ports with submissions from outside programmers, he managed to collect enough material to have DEC publish &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; in 1973. The book was an immediate success and ultimately ran through three printings to 1975.

By the mid-1970s BASIC was a standard feature of all DEC machines and FOCAL use evaporated.

===Rebirth in the Soviet Union===
The PDP-11 had been cloned in the Soviet Union in the 1970s for military purposes. In the 1980s, single-chip variations similar to the LSI-11 were produced that gave rise to a series of PDP-11 compatible home computers. Most notable among several models were the Electronika BK series, released in 1985. These were initially supplied with FOCAL on a ROM cartridge, while a BASIC cartridge was an optional add-on. Later models supplied BASIC by default.

==Language==
The following description is based on FOCAL-69 as seen in the FOCAL-8 language reference manual.

===Direct and indirect modes===
FOCAL followed the JOSS model for interaction via a command line interface. This allowed users to type in commands in &quot;direct mode&quot;, which were performed immediately, or to prefix them with a line number, in which case they were added to the program if they were unique, or overrode existing code if the same number had previously been used.

The method of operation is similar to BASIC&#x27;s &quot;immediate mode&quot; vs. &quot;program mode&quot;. It contrasts with JOSS, in which all commands, both program and direct, were saved and loaded as part of the user&#x27;s workspace. This allowed JOSS to have commands without line numbers, which they used for definitions and other tasks. FOCAL lacked this capability, so those instructions that needed to be loaded and saved became options on other program-mode commands like .

===Program statements===
Every line in a FOCAL program must start with a line number. As with JOSS, line numbers are fixed-point numbers consisting of two two-digit integers separated by a period. In FOCAL-8, valid line numbers range from 1.01 through 31.99. When printed out, using , the FOCAL equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s , leading zeros will be added; 1.10 will be printed as . This makes all lines numbers five characters long when output so that all line numbers align. Statements referring to those lines do not need the leading zeros, for example, .

The number on the left of the period is known as the &quot;group number&quot;. Groups provide some level of code organization that is lacking in languages like Fortran or BASIC. The primary use of these was to use a group as a subroutine which can be called with , for example, will jump to the subroutine written in group 5. The editor also used these during edit-time, for example, one could to produce a listing of the code in group 2, or to delete all of the lines in group 4.

Every line must start with a command keyword following the line number. There is no concept of a &quot;default command&quot; as is the case in BASIC with its optional statement. Multiple statements can be placed on a single line, separated by semicolons. Usually, the behavior is no different than if the statements had been on separate lines, except in the case of FOR loops.

=== Commands ===
====ASK====
The command (abbreviation A) will take a list of strings and variables, echo the strings and store the user input in variables. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .

 01.01 ASK &quot;NAME&quot;, NAME
 01.02 ASK &quot;COORDINATES&quot;, X, Y
 01.03 ASK &quot;A1&quot;,A1,&quot;OMEGA&quot;,W,&quot;T0&quot;,T0,&quot;DAMPING FACTOR&quot;,DAMPINGFACTOR

If the user doesn&#x27;t enter a number but enters text, the system will convert the initial character to a number with &quot;A&quot;=1, &quot;B&quot;=2, etc.

====COMMENT====
The command (abbreviation C) creates a remark. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s . The original manual lists as a synonym of COMMENT, used to mark empty lines, but this has no internal difference.
 01.01 COMMENT: THE SUMER GAME, BY RICHARD MERRILL

====DO====
The command (abbreviation D) branches execution to a subroutine. It is the equivalent of BASIC&#x27;s . The subroutine is referenced either by group number or line number. If a line number is provided, that single line is run and then automatically returns to continue execution at the statement after the . If no line number is provided, execution starts at the first line of the block and continues until the end of the block is reached. is supported, but is only required to return early from the group, it is not needed at the end of the group.
 01.15 DO 7.24
 01.16 DO 8

====FOR====
The command (abbreviation F) implements a for loop. When three arguments are specified, the first is the initial value of the loop variable, the second is the increment, and the third value is the terminating value for the loop. If only two values are provided, the first is the initial value and the second is the terminating value, and the increment is set to 1. This is the pattern from FORTRAN&#x27;s loops, as opposed to BASIC&#x27;s where the increment is the last value, if present.

In contrast to other parts of the language where multiple statements on a line are independent, the always runs the statements that follow it on the line before the termination has been met, and then continues to the next line. Thus, loops have to be on a single line, or alternatively, call a subroutine with . There is no equivalent of BASIC&#x27;s .
 01.01 FOR X=1,10; TYPE X,!
 01.02 FOR X=0,10,100; DO 2

A sample FOR loop:
 01.10 ASK &quot;HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW ?&quot;,PRINCIPAL
 01.20 ASK &quot;FOR HOW MANY YEARS ?&quot;,TERM
 01.30 FOR RATE=4.0.5,10;DO 2.0
 01.40 QUIT
 02.10 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM
 02.20 TYPE &quot;RATE&quot;,RATE,&quot; &quot;,&quot;INTEREST&quot;,INTEREST,!

====GOTO====
The command (abbreviation G) jumps program execution to the specified line number. It is identical to the same-named statement in BASIC. In FOCAL, is also used to begin execution, like BASIC&#x27;s , but in this use, the documentation refers to it as instead of in spite of the underlying command being the same.
 01.05 GOTO 1.01
 02.90 TYPE !!,&quot;TRY AGAIN.&quot;,!!!!!;GOTO 1.1

====IF====
The command (abbreviation I) provides a conditional branch based on the sign of the expression. After the numeric expression, the IF command can take one to three line numbers. If the expression is less than zero, execution branches to the first line number; if equal to zero, to the second line number; if greater than zero, to the third line number. The language lacked relative operators such as greater than, equal or less than. To branch if X &gt; 5, one must compare X - 5.
 02.20 IF (25-25) 2.4,2.3,2.4
 03.01 IF (X) 3.1,3.02,3.1

IF could be short-formed by placing a semicolon (or end of line) beyond the first line number. For example:

 02.20 IF (X)1.8; TYPE &quot;Q&quot;
 02.30 IF (X)1.8,2.50
 02.40 TYPE &quot;P&quot;

In this case the test at 2.20 will cause the program to jump to line 1.8 if the test is negative, otherwise it will continue and type &quot;Q&quot; to the console. Line 2.30 will jump to 1.8 or 2.5 if the value is negative or zero, and otherwise continue to type &quot;P&quot; to the console.

====QUIT====
The command (abbreviation Q) terminates execution of the program and returns control to the editing environment. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s or .
 01.10 FOR X=-10,1,10;TYPE X
 01.20 QUIT

====RETURN====
The command (abbreviation R) branches execution from a subroutine back to the calling location. The use of is optional at the last line of a subroutine, a subroutine returns at the last line in the group anyway. The following is a sample subroutine for converting a yes/no prompt into a value.
 22.78 COMMENT: &#x27;YES OR NO&#x27; SUBROUTINE
 22.80 ASK &quot;ANSWER YES OR NO ? &quot;,AN
 22.82 IF (AN-0YES)22.84,22.86
 22.84 IF (AN-0NO)22.8,22.88,22.8
 22.86 SET X=2;RETURN
 22.88 SET X=1;RETURN

====SET====
The command (abbreviation S) assigns the results of an expression to the specified variable. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .
 01.30 SET PI=3.14156
 01.60 SET INTEREST=PRINCIPAL*(RATE/100)*TERM

====TYPE ====
The command (abbreviation T) provides for output of one or more items separated by commas. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .

Items can be variables, literal strings surrounded by double-quotes, or a variety of control characters. The control characters include the to output a carriage return and line feed, for the carriage return alone, and for a tab character. Control characters can be strung together, for example, will output three CR/LFs without the need to separate them with commas.

 TYPE [NUMBERS, E1, &quot;TEXT&quot;, !, #, :, $ OR %] ...OUTPUT
 01.10 TYPE &quot;HI THERE, GOOD LOOKING. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO BORROW?&quot;,!
 01.50 TYPE &quot;INTEREST&quot;,INTEREST,!
 01.80 TYPE &quot;THE INTEREST FOR&quot;,TERM,&quot; YEARS&quot;,!,&quot;IS&quot;,INTEREST, &quot; DOLLARS.&quot;,!!
 01.90 TYPE &quot;NEW YORK&quot;,!,&quot;WASHINGTON&quot;,!,&quot;ATLANTA&quot;,!,&quot;DALLAS&quot;,!
 02.10 TYPE &quot;X&quot;,X,&quot; &quot;,&quot;X^2&quot;,X^2,&quot; &quot;,&quot;SQRT&quot;,FSQT(X)
 03.20 TYPE &quot;.&quot;,#
 02.20 TYPE !!!!!

 also included an optional format specifier indicated using the format , where x is the number of digits to the left of the decimal, and yz is the number of digits to the right of the period. The default format was , meaning a maximum of eight digits and four to the right of the period. So, for example:

 SET A=67823
 TYPE %6.01,A
 = 67823.0
 TYPE %5,A
 = 67823
 TYPE %8.03,A
 = 67823.000
 TYPE %,A
 = 6.7823E4

Note the extra leading spaces in some examples, padding out the full defined width. Using % alone caused the output to be printed in &quot;floating point format&quot; using the E.

A special control character was which caused a table of all defined variables and their values to be printed. Only the first two letters of the name will be printed, padded with a zero if need be. Arrays elements are printed on separate lines and variables with only one element will be indexed (00). For example:

 TYPE $
 A0(00)=67823

=== Variables ===
Variable names may start with any letter except F (F is reserved for functions) and may contain any sequence of letters and numbers. However, only the first two characters are significant. For example, the following code sample from &quot;FOCAL: A New Conversational Language&quot; refers to the same variable as DESTINATION and then DES. Internally, both references refer to a variable designated DE:
 01.80 ASK DESTINATION
 02.30 IF (DES-14) 2.4,3.1,2.4

Any variable may be treated as an array, allowing subscripts from -2048 through 2047.

=== Math ===
FOCAL contained five mathematical operators:
* for exponents – the exponent is converted to a 12-bit integer
* for multiplication
* for division
* for addition
* for subtraction

One curiosity of the 1968 version of FOCAL was that the operators had independent precedence, as in the order above. Although this certainly applies to exponentiation, multiplication, and division, there is some ambiguity in the 1968 FOCAL manual with regards to addition and subtraction. Specifically, examples that demonstrate operator precedence for multiplication and division are provided, but examples demonstrating operator precedence for addition and subtraction are lacking. Nevertheless, the literal interpretation of the 1968 FOCAL manual suggests that the formula would be evaluated in the order 2-(3+1) and thus produce -2. This was very different than most languages, where the + and - had equal precedence and would be evaluated (2-3)+1 to produce 0. This can cause subtle errors when converting FOCAL source code to other systems. 

However, the + and - have the same precedence in FOCAL-69 and FOCAL-71, so yields 0, as expected.

FOCAL was unusual in that mathematical expressions could use (), [], and &lt;&gt; interchangeably in matched pairs to establish precedence. For example, the following is a valid expression:

 01.30 SET A=&lt;10*[5+1]*(1+5)&gt;

All of these are the same level of precedence and read left-to-right when at the same level, so this statement will be evaluated [], then (), then &lt;&gt;, to produce 360.

The language contained the following built-in functions:
* – Absolute value
* – Arctangent
* – Cosine of argument in radians
* – Natural base to the power of the argument
* – Integer part of the argument
* – Naperian log
* – Random number
* – Sign of the argument; FSGN(0)=1 in FOCAL-69, but FSGN(0)=0 in FOCAL-71 and later versions
* – Sine of an angle given in radians
* – Square root

===Character functions===
FOCAL-71 added two new functions for inputting single-character values, similar to ASK but returning ASCII values.

* stops until the user types a character and then returns the ASCII code
* outputs the ASCII value as a character to the console or file

===Other functions===
FOCAL also included several special-purpose functions:

* reads a value from the PDP-8&#x27;s analog-to-digital converters, with the channel number as the parameter
* plots at a given Y location
* plots at a given X location

==Environment commands==
=== Running programs ===
FOCAL used in the editor to start a program. However, a rule-of-thumb was to shorten this to . This is the equivalent of in BASIC. can also be used in the editor to start execution at a specified line.

=== Editing commands ===
New lines are entered into a program by simply starting the command with a line number. The editing commands were codice_1 (abbreviation E), codice_2 (abbreviation M), and codice_3 (abbreviation W):
* codice_1 – zero out all variables; this is sometimes used in programs to reset them
* codice_5 – delete the statement at a specified line
* codice_6 – delete all statements in a specified group
* codice_7 – delete an entire program
* codice_8 – allow editing a specified line
* codice_9 – display the statement at a specified line
* codice_10 – display all statements in a specified group
* codice_11 – display a specified program

=== File commands ===
The file command was OPEN (abbreviation O):
* – prepare to read from the start of a file
* – prepare to write from the start of a file
* – resume input
* – resume output
* – output the buffer and close a file

=== Library commands ===
FOCAL included the ability to manage collections of FOCAL programs as a code library. Programs could call other programs in a chain fashion using codice_12, or call a single subroutine in another program using codice_13. Program names could be six characters long. The LIBRARY command (abbreviation L) had the following sub-commands:

* codice_14 – delete a program
* codice_15 – catalog
* codice_16 – chain a program, optionally resuming at a specified line number
* codice_17 – save a program
* codice_18 – return to the PDP-8 monitor program
FOCAL-71 added:
* codice_19 – load a program
* codice_20 – call a subroutine in an external program

==Error codes==
Since the interpreter lacked sufficient memory space to store error messages, or even a table of error numbers, FOCAL used a workaround by reporting the address of the error-detecting code as a fixed-point number. For example, the division by zero error was detected it would report , where 28.73 represents the code checking for this error at memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words, and 01.10 is the line number where the error occurred. Pages in the PDP-8 were 128 bytes long, so this address translates to location 3657.

==Changes between versions==
DEC released three versions of FOCAL for the PDP-8 series, the original, known simply as FOCAL, and two updated versions, 
FOCAL,1969 and FOCAL,1971. FOCAL,1969 was largely identical to the original, but FOCAL,1971 was major update that added file handling, new mathematics, and a variety of other changes. In contrast to the first two versions, which were stand-alone systems, FOCAL,1971 was based on the emerging OS/8 (then still known as PS/8) and relied more heavily on that operating system for file handling and editing.

===FOCAL,1971===
One change in the new version was a 10-digit math package for added precision. The function now returned zero if the input expression evaluated to zero. Previously this would return one. The now used a better algorithm that produced more randomly distributed numbers. It also added the new function that took a string and returned its ASCII value (akin to BASIC&#x27;s ) and which took a number and returned a string with that ASCII character ().

As all of these options used up limited memory, when started, FOCAL,1971 entered a dialog that asked the user what features they wanted to use.

==Comparison with JOSS==
FOCAL is, for all intents, a cleaned-up version of JOSS with changes to make the syntax terser and easier to parse. Almost all FOCAL commands have a one-to-one correspondence with JOSS and differ only in details. The most obvious change at first glance is that JOSS is case-insensitive and outputs keywords in mixed-case whereas FOCAL was upper-case only. Additionally, JOSS statements end with a period, making them look like written statements, whereas FOCAL has no required line-ending.

One major difference is that JOSS included a complete set of comparison operations and a boolean logic system that operated within and constructs. Furthermore, branches and loops could be applied to any statement, in contrast to FOCAL, where the only operation either could carry out was the equivalent to a goto. For example, in JOSS, one could:

 1.10 Type A if X&gt;10.
 1.20 Type i for i=1(1)10.

The first line optionally prints A based on the value of X, and the second prints the numbers 1 to 10. In contrast, FOCAL lacked the ability to compare values, and loops were applied by skipping to the next line when they completed. The equivalent code in FOCAL would be:

 1.10 IF (X-10),1.30
 1.20 TYPE A!
 1.30 FOR I=1,1,10;TYPE I,!

JOSS&#x27; implementation makes common constructs easier to build and more closely match a programmer&#x27;s intentions, at the cost of making the runtime more complex. For example, JOSS allowed ranges in loops to be described in a flexible fashion like 1,2,3,10(5)50,75,78. This flexibility comes at a cost; in FOCAL the start, stop, and step can be written in a custom in-memory structure and easily updated as the loop is performed, whereas JOSS requires it to reevaluate an expression that may be, but often isn&#x27;t, more complex.

In order to make the code terser in FOCAL, changes were relatively minor. For example, JOSS&#x27; becomes the slightly smaller FOCAL , while becomes . Command keywords were also shortened where possible, so JOSS&#x27; becomes FOCAL&#x27;s , both to make it shorter and to allow the letter D to be uniquely used for .

To simplify the parser, some JOSS constructs were removed. For example, JOSS could perform multiple assignments with while in FOCAL these had to be made individual statements, . Likewise, JOSS&#x27; , used to format output, was combined into FOCAL&#x27;s with the .

==Comparison with BASIC==
Comparisons between FOCAL and BASIC were inevitable since both languages were common on minicomputers of the same era, and the two languages have much in common in syntax and structure. In most cases, there is a direct conversion of FOCAL code to and from BASIC. For example, to ask a user to input a value, in FOCAL one would:

 ASK &quot;What is your age?&quot;,AGE

while in BASIC the equivalent is:

With the exception of a few features that were missing from one or the other, and some relatively minor differences in syntax, the two languages are very similar.

One notable exception is the in BASIC, which allowed any statement to be placed after the , making it more similar with JOSS&#x27; control structures. BASIC reversed the ordering of the code compared to JOSS, placing the conditional expression at the start of the line rather than the end; in BASIC one uses whereas JOSS used . FOCAL&#x27;s was more like BASIC&#x27;s computed goto, , but the allowed any number of lines as targets, as opposed to only three for negative, zero and positive as in FOCAL.

Another major difference between the two is that FOCAL lacked inherent support for strings as data elements that could be assigned to variables. As was the case in early BASICs or FORTRAN versions before the addition of strings (in F77), this limitation was generally avoided through the use of literal strings in input and output commands. It was only when manipulating individual strings, or characters in them, that this became a significant problem.

As string variables were not supported, inputting a string used a kludge that converted any characters typed in by a user to their numeric character value. For example, if one typed at an input statement, FOCAL would convert the H to &quot;8&quot;, the numeric value of &quot;H&quot; in the PDP-8&#x27;s six-bit character codes (&quot;H&quot; is the eighth letter). It would then interpret the &quot;E&quot; as starting an exponent, then it would try to compute &quot;8&quot; to the &quot;LLO&quot; power, which would take several seconds of CPU time and result in a value of 0.76593020E+103, not a helpful response. Nevertheless, by asking questions that would be responded to using single-letter responses, like &quot;&lt;samp&gt;Do you need instructions, Y or N&lt;/samp&gt;&quot;, programmers could test the result against known character values to produce what looked like character input.

Prepending a zero to a string would coerce it to numeric, so programs could test for specific multicharacter strings using IF statements such as which will branch to 2.00 if A = &quot;BROWN&quot; or 1.00 otherwise. However the program would throw an overflow error if the user entered text with unfortunately-placed &#x27;E&#x27; characters. For instance, one could test for &quot;BROWN&quot; or &quot;RED&quot; but not &quot;GREEN&quot; or &quot;YELLOW&quot;.

FOCAL&#x27;s PDP-8 implementation used a floating point representation that represented numbers as four 12-bit words, forty-eight bits in total, with thirty-six bits of mantissa and twelve bits of exponent. This allowed for both significantly higher precision and a significantly wider range of values than most contemporary interpreters, making FOCAL a reasonable choice for serious numerical work. This high precision, and good choices for default decimal output formatting, meant that difficulties with binary-to-decimal rounding were not evident to beginning users. For comparison, Microsoft BASIC initially used a 32-bit format, while later versions expanded this to 40-bits. Most BASICs had problems with rounding that led to simple equations resulting in tiny non-zero remainders.

It is generally agreed that FOCAL was more efficient in its use of resources than comparable BASIC systems. On a typical machine of the day, often with 6 to 24 kilobytes of magnetic-core memory, FOCAL could handle larger and more complex programming tasks than BASIC.

== Versions and spinoffs ==
The Coca-Cola Corporation used a customized version of FOCAL called COKE.

FOCAL was later implemented on the PDP-7, PDP-9, PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-12, PDP-5 and LINC-8.

The FOCAL manual showed how to add commands to the FOCAL parser, so many sites added specialized commands for operating custom hardware.

The Digital Equipment Computer Users&#x27; Society collected many patches and enhancements for FOCAL. There were even major enhanced offshoots of FOCAL, such as FOCAL-W, which added many features, including better mass storage file I/O and even virtual variable memory.

In the mid-1970s DELTA was a more sophisticated version of FOCAL. Program line numbers went from 00 to 99 &quot;parts&quot; and 000000 to 999999 &quot;steps&quot; executed in alphanumeric order. DELTA had some specialized commands for the Tektronix 4010/14 display scope.

In Russia, it saw use as late as the early 1990s in mass-produced home computers of the Electronika BK series.

Microsoft sold a version of FOCAL supplied on paper-tape. According to Raymond Chen, the master tape is missing and FOCAL is no longer available.

==Example code==
The original Lunar Lander makes an excellent example for examining FOCAL code, as it uses most of the features of the language. This code is from the original, found on Jim Storer&#x27;s Lunar Lander page.

The program is cleanly separated into many subroutines. This was almost universal in FOCAL programs (and JOSS), as the line number scheme made such constructs easy to use. This program uses nine routines. The first, group 1, simply prints out the instructions using the ype statement and sets the initial values for the run. The mass of fuel is not recorded directly, instead, it uses the current ass and empty mass, , so the remaining fuel is and the lander runs out of fuel when is 0. Also note the rase at the end of line , which resets all the variable values.

The main game loop is driven by group 2. As the code &quot;falls&quot; through group 1 into group 2 during the first run, the initial values are printed out in the first two lines. Near the end of line , the user is sked to input the burn rate as , and then the loop timer is reset using . Line tests the user&#x27;s input against several possibilities, if it is over 200 or below 8 it types &quot;&lt;samp&gt;NOT POSSIBLE&lt;/samp&gt;&quot; and a row of periods, and then loops back to ask the user to try again. If the value is between these values, it jumps forward to group 3. Note that the limited capabilities of FOCAL&#x27;s command are evident here, in BASIC this could be reduced to a single 

Group 3 first tests to see if the fuel has run out, and jumps to group 4 if it has. Then it tests if the 10-second period in has expired and, if so, loops back to print everything out again, which has the side-effect of resetting and to 10. Line tests to see if the amount of fuel burned this period, , will reduce the mass of the vehicle as a whole, , beyond the empty weight, N. If not, it moves on, if it will, it instead sets the loop timer to the amount of time the remaining fuel will burn, thus ending the loop early. In either case, it calls group 9 to update the velocity and position. It then loops over groups 7, 8 and 9 until the value of I converges.

When the 10-second timer runs out, or it reaches the end due to the fuel test in line or the altitude test in . In the latter cases, it will jump to group 4 and fall through to group 5, or jump to group 5 directly. Group 5 types the end-of-game results and then asks the user if they&#x27;d like to try again. If so, it jumps to to clear out all values and print the headers again, if not if falls through to and uits.

<text>Sergio Rossi is an Italian fashion brand that focuses on footwear. The company was founded in 1951 by Sergio Rossi.

== History ==

Founded in 1951 in San Mauro Pascoli, the brand takes its name from founder Sergio Rossi, who inherited the tools and traditions of shoemaking from his father. Rossi was initially making sandals that he would sell on the beaches of Rimini and in boutiques in Bologna.

The first official collection of Sergio Rossi brand shoes was produced in 1968. According to &quot;Vogue&quot;, during the 1960s, the company &quot;rapidly became synonymous with Italian quality and classic feminine designs.&quot;

The brand collaborated with Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Versace, and Azzedine Alaïa in the 1970s. In 1980, the expansion process started with the opening of the first single-brand boutiques in Ancona, Italy, and then later in Turin, Florence, Rome, Brussels, New York, Los Angeles, and London.

In 1999, the PPR Luxury Division, known as Gucci Group, acquired 70% of shares of Sergio Rossi for a value of approximately $96 million. Six years later, the Kering group bought the remaining 30%, obtaining full control of the Sergio Rossi brand. In 2015, the company was sold to Investindustrial holdings.

In June 2021, Fosun Fashion Group announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire 100% of Sergio Rossi S.p.A. In July 2024, Paul Andrew was named as the brand&#x27;s creative director.

== San Mauro production plant ==

The San Mauro production plant was built in 2003. It measures a total of , with accounting for production and warehouse space and of space for offices, pattern, and prototype departments. San Mauro&#x27;s industrial platform produces women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s luxury footwear.

<doc id="1170596" wikidata="Q2154182" url="?curid=1170596" title="Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons">
<text>The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (officially known as Columbia University Roy and Diana Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons) is the medical school of Columbia University, located at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.

Founded in 1767 by Samuel Bard as the medical department of King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University), the College of Physicians and Surgeons was the first medical school in the Thirteen Colonies to award the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Beginning in 1993, the College of Physicians and Surgeons was also the first U.S. medical school to hold a white coat ceremony. Following a gift of $250 million from Roy and Diana Vagelos in 2017, the school became the first medical school in the nation to replace loans with scholarships for all students who qualify for financial aid when it did so in 2018.

Columbia is affiliated with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Students additionally rotate through its affiliate hospitals: Harlem Hospital Center; Stamford Hospital in Stamford, CT; and Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, NY.

==History==

===Colonial years===
In 1767, Dr. Samuel Bard, an alumnus of then-King&#x27;s College and the University of Edinburgh Medical School, opened a medical school at Columbia. At the time, the medical program at King&#x27;s College was the first to open in the Province of New York and only the second to be opened in the American Colonies. The school was modelled on the University of Edinburgh Medical School, which at the time was the world leader. Three years later, in 1770, King&#x27;s College conferred its first medical degree to Robert Tucker, this would prove to be the first Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) awarded in the Thirteen Colonies. Prior to King&#x27;s College of Medicine offering of the M.D. degree, other American and Canadian medical schools had been offering the Bachelor of Medicine degree. King&#x27;s College continued to educate young doctors until 1776 when the school was forced to close due to the onset of the Revolutionary War and the occupation of New York by British soldiers. King&#x27;s College remained closed until 1784 when the school was reopened as Columbia College and in December of that year, the faculty of the medical school were re-instated. In 1791, Bard, now a prominent colonial physician whom George Washington credited with saving his life, was named dean of the medical school.


===Merger with the College of Physicians and Surgeons===
In 1807, with a growing young nation in need of adequately trained physicians, the New York State Board of Regents founded, under separate charter, the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Merely four years later, in 1811, Dr. Samuel Bard, dean of Columbia University Medical School, became president of the college. The year 1814 then saw the merger of Columbia University Medical School into the College of Physicians and Surgeons, a move that was made in an attempt to reverse what then was perceived as a period of decline for the medical school. 

Despite this merger, the College of Physicians and Surgeons retained its independence from Columbia and it was only in 1860 that the College of Physicians and Surgeons, at that time occupying buildings across West Fifty-ninth Street from the Roosevelt Hospital (its major teaching hospital at the time), after severing its ties to the New York Board of Regents and through agreement between the trustees of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Columbia, became the official medical school of Columbia University. This new relationship between the college and Columbia was minimal at best, however, with the college retaining independence from Columbia. It was not until 1891 that the College of Physicians and Surgeons would be fully integrated and incorporated into Columbia. In 1886, the Sloane Maternity Hospital, later the Sloane Hospital for Women, was founded as part of Physicians and Surgeons.

===Medical Center Formation===
In 1911, Columbia University entered into a &quot;Formal Agreement of Alliance&quot; with Presbyterian Hospital, a hospital founded in 1868 by James Lenox a New York philanthropist. It was this alliance, initiated by philanthropist Edward Harkness, that helped to pave the way for the creation of a new medical center format. In 1928, the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center opened its doors in a building largely funded by Harkness. Set on land in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center was the first place in the world to provide facilities for patient care, medical education, and research all under one roof. It was the first academic medical center and pioneered the practice of combining medical training with patient care. Included in this project with Presbyterian Hospital were the Babies Hospital, the Neurologic Institute of New York, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute; these were then joined in 1950 by the New York Orthopaedic Hospital.

In 1997, the Presbyterian Hospital merged with New York Hospital (partner of Weill Cornell Medicine of Cornell University) to form the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. This new hospital system incorporated many of the satellite hospitals and affiliated programs of these two institutions. While the two medical schools remain independent of one another, there has been significant cross-fertilization between the two campuses, leading to increasing numbers of shared research experiences and training programs. All hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System are affiliated with either the Cornell or Columbia medical schools.

===Renaming===
At the 2017 Crown Awards, President Lee Bollinger announced that the school would officially be renamed as the Columbia University Roy and Diana Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. This decision was made in response to a gift of $250 million from Dr. P. Roy and Diana Vagelos. $150 million of the gift, was dedicated to endow a fund to help Columbia eliminate student loans for medical students who qualify for financial aid. The remaining $100 million will be divided equally to support precision medicine programs and basic science research as well as an endowed professorship in the Department of Medicine in honor of the Vagelos family&#x27;s longtime doctor and friend, Thomas P. Jacobs, MD.

==Academics==
Beginning in the fall of 2009, the medical school implemented a new curriculum that differed markedly from more traditional structures. The largest change involved a reduction in the number of preclinical months from twenty-four to eighteen and the expansion of the electives and selectives period to fourteen months. Each student now is required to spend four to ten months working on a scholarly project before graduation.

==Campus==
Situated on land overlooking the Hudson River and separated from Columbia&#x27;s undergraduate campus in Morningside Heights by approximately fifty blocks and the neighborhood of Harlem, the Columbia University Medical Center has its own unique standing and identity. The campus comprises not only the College of Physicians and Surgeons, but also the College of Dental Medicine (formerly the School of Dental and Oral Surgery), the School of Nursing, the Mailman School of Public Health, the Presbyterian portion of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (including the Morgan Stanley Children&#x27;s Hospital) and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Affiliated hospitals include Harlem Hospital, Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, and Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, New York. In August 2016 the Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center, new 100,000-square-foot, 14-story glass medical education tower opened at 104 Haven Avenue, between 171st and 172nd Streets, near the northern tip of the campus. Housing options on Columbia&#x27;s Medical Campus include Bard Hall and the Bard-Haven Towers, a complex of three, 31-story apartment buildings overlooking the Hudson River and the George Washington Bridge. Students are guaranteed housing on campus all years, although many students choose to live in other parts of New York City.

==Student life==
===P&amp;S Club===
There are student clubs covering a range of professional and personal interests, all of which fall under the umbrella of the P&amp;S Club. One unusual element is the Bard Hall Players, a theatrical group entirely run by the students of the medical campus, and one of the largest and most active medical school theater groups in the country. They perform a musical and two plays each year. Founded over a century ago by John Mott, the 1946 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, the P&amp;S Club serves to support and provide activities and organizations for the enrichment of the lives of the College of Physicians and Surgeons students. The P&amp;S Club is well known for its humanitarian aims; most notably the 1917 purchase of a steam launch delivered to Sir William Grenfell, a physician living in Labrador. This launch was used to deliver medical services to the Inuit and First Nations fishermen living on the islands of the Labrador coast and frequently, was crewed by P&amp;S students.

==Prominent faculty==
Prominent faculty members include Nobel Prize laureates Richard Axel, Eric Kandel, and Joachim Frank; author Oliver Sacks; 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner for nonfiction Siddhartha Mukherjee; and Rudolph Leibel whose co-discovery of the hormone leptin, and cloning of the leptin and leptin receptor genes, has had a major role in the area of understanding human obesity. Jean C. Emond, Thomas S. Zimmer Professor of Surgery, participated in the first living-donor liver transplantation in children in North America and established the liver transplant program at Columbia, which has become one of the largest in the United States. Craig R. Smith, Chairman of Surgery, performed a quadruple bypass surgery on former President Bill Clinton in 2004. Joshua Sonett, Professor of Clinical Surgery and Chief of Thoracic Surgery, performed a lung decortication on former President Bill Clinton in 2005.

Robert Ernest Noble, who received his M.D. in 1899 was a U.S. Army medical officer who researched causes and treatments for yellow fever and malaria during construction of the Panama Canal. After his service in France during World War I, he was the longtime director of the Library of the Surgeon General&#x27;s Office.

<text>The Columbia University School of Social Work is the graduate school of social work of Columbia University in New York City. It is one of the oldest social work programs in the US, with roots extending back to 1898. It began awarding a Master of Science degree in 1940. As of 2018, it was one of the largest social work schools in the United States, with an enrollment of over 1,000 students.

==History==
===1898–1999===
In 1898, the New York Charity Organization Society established the first Summer School in Philanthropic Work, a six-week program, at 105 East 22nd Street in New York City. Twenty-five men and women attended the first classes. It is one of the oldest social work programs in the US. In 1904, it was expanded into the first full-time full-year course of graduate study in social work, and later a two-year course, at the newly renamed New York School of Philanthropy.

The name of the School was changed in 1919 to the New York School of Social Work. In 1931, the School moved to 122 East 22nd Street. In 1940, the School was affiliated with Columbia University as one of its graduate schools, and began awarding a Master of Science degree. In 1949, the School moved to the Andrew Carnegie Mansion at 2 East 91st Street, and later to 622 West 113th Street. The first doctoral degree was awarded in 1952.

In 1961, the School formed a coalition in support of President John F. Kennedy establishing the Peace Corps. In 1963 the name of the school was changed to Columbia University School of Social Work. In 1966, the School began a longitudinal study of foster children and their families. The first fully endowed professorship was set up in 1991, followed by the full endowment of the Kenworthy Chair and nine additional endowed professorships. In 1997, an agreement was concluded with the UN Economic and Social Council to provide new program support and a fellowship. In that year, the school&#x27;s endowment surpassed $40 million.

In 1992, students of the school organized protests and teach-ins as part of a nationwide effort to protest welfare cuts. The organizers of the school&#x27;s events called the welfare cuts an example of the demonization of people on welfare.

===2000–present===
In 2002, construction of the current School of Social Work building began on Amsterdam Avenue and West 121st Street, north of Columbia&#x27;s campus. The building was completed in 2004 and first used by students and faculty during the 2004–05 academic year. In 2007, the School founded the Global Health Research Center of Central Asia to develop and advance evidence-based, sustainable solutions to emerging public health and social issues in the region, receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health.

In 2012, the School established the Fisher Cummings Washington Fellows Program with a major gift. The program funds select students for a semester-long internship in Washington, D.C., with an emphasis on working to promote social justice and the well-being of women, children, and families at the federal level. In 2014, the School opened its Online Campus for earning a Master&#x27;s of Science in Social Work (MSSW) from various major cities across the United States.

In 2014, the &quot;Beyond The Bars&quot; conference was hosted by Columbia Center for Justice. This conference is hosted by students, faculty, and community leaders who have been impacted by incarceration.

==Student body and faculty==
As of 2023, the School had 1,093 students. It had 36 full-time faculty, and 233 part-time faculty. The School received $15 million of externally sponsored research expenditures in 2022.
During their MSW, students have the choice between four different pathways: Advanced Clinical Practice (ACP), Integrated Practice and Programming (IPP), Policy Practice (PP), and Leadership Management and Entrepreneurship (LME).

==Achievements, mission, and journal==

The School has helped form the Urban League and the White House Conferences on Children and Youth. The School was one of the first to develop an ecological approach to social work. Members of the School faculty assisted Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins in writing and implementing the Social Security Act of 1935. During and after World War II, the School staff helped to extend the social work role into the military. The School&#x27;s 1966 study on foster children and their parents has also had an impact on national policy.

In 2008, the School was ranked fourth in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Graduate Best Social Work Programs.&quot; Between 1990 and 2004, the School ranked 19th out of 61 social work doctoral programs in admissions selectivity.

The School&#x27;s mission focuses on the development of leaders in social work practice and research, the advancement of the social work profession, professional values, knowledge, and skills, and the enhancement of well-being and the promotion of human rights and social justice at the local, national, and global level through the creation of responsive social programs and policies.

In 2003, the School began publishing the &quot;Journal of Student Social Work&quot; &quot;The Journal&quot; is a scholarly publication featuring articles related to all aspects of the social work profession, including clinical practice, public policy, and administration. In 2010 &quot;The Journal&quot; was renamed the &quot;Columbia Social Work Review&quot;.

<text>&quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; is a 1965 song recorded by the Supremes for the Motown label.

Written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; was the fifth consecutive and overall number-one song for the group on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart in the United States from June 6, 1965, through June 12, 1965, also topping the soul chart for a week.

==History==
Eddie Holland of the Holland–Dozier–Holland wrote the basis sketch for &quot;Back in My Arms Again.&quot;

&quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; was the last of five Supremes songs in a row to go number one (the others are &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, &quot;Baby Love&quot;, &quot;Come See About Me&quot;, and &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot;). The song&#x27;s middle eight is almost identical to a later Holland-Dozier-Holland hit, The Isley Brothers &quot;This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)&quot;.

On the album in which this single appeared, &quot;More Hits by the Supremes&quot;, and on the official single, each member is pictured separately on the front cover, with her signature above it.

The Supremes performed the song on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, a syndicated daytime program, on May 5, 1965, and again on November 3. They performed the song nationally on the NBC variety program &quot;Hullabaloo!&quot; on Tuesday, May 11, 1965, peaking on the music charts in the following weeks.

&quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; has &quot;a strong teen lyric and a powerful vocal performance pitted against a hard rock backing in full support.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a rollicking, pop-r&amp;b romancer about a lucky lass who gets back with her boyfriend after quite a hiatus.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; chose it as one of their &quot;Single Picks of the Week,&quot; stating that the Supremes are &quot;unbeatable.&quot; Allmusic critic Ed Hogan called the rhythm section provided by the Funk Brothers &quot;tight,&quot; the saxophone played by Mike Terry &quot;rollicking&quot; and the vibraphone played by James Gitten &quot;dreamy.&quot;

==Personnel==
* Lead vocals by Diana Ross
* Background vocals by Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson
* All instruments by the Funk Brothers
**Earl Van Dyke – piano
**Joe Messina – guitar
**James Jamerson – bass
**Benny Benjamin – drums
**James Gittens – vibraphone
**Mike Terry – baritone saxophone

==Later versions==
&quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1978 with a remake by Genya Ravan on a single (taken from the singer&#x27;s album &quot;Urban Desire&quot;) which was Ravan&#x27;s only Hot 100 entry, peaking at #92.

The song almost made the Hot 100 in 1983 via a remake on Motown&#x27;s Gordy label by female vocal group High Inergy, whose 1977 debut album &quot;Turnin&#x27; On&quot; had yielded a Top 20 hit in (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Turn Me Off&quot;) and elicited numerous comparisons with the Supremes. High Inergy remained a one hit wonder despite the release of seven more albums and 27 more singles. In 1983, the group released what would be their last album, &quot;Groove Patrol&quot;, from which a near note-for-note remake of &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; was released as a single (the group&#x27;s last) and reached #105 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart (without ranking on the magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B chart).

&quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot; has also been remade by the Michael Stanley Band (on &quot;Greatest Hints&quot;, 1979),Nicolette Larson (as &quot;Back in My Arms&quot; on &quot;In the Nick of Time&quot; in 1980), by Michael Bolton (on his eponymous 1983 album), by The Forester Sisters (on &quot;Perfume, Ribbons &amp; Pearls&quot; in 1986), and by Colin James (on the &quot;American Boyfriends&quot; soundtrack album in 1989).

The song was recorded by the all-female American rock group Fanny in early 1973 but their version, produced by Todd Rundgren, remained unreleased until 2002, when it appeared on Rhino Handmade&#x27;s limited-edition Fanny anthology &quot;First Time In A Long Time: The Reprise Recordings&quot;. The outtake was later included on the 2016 reissue of 1973&#x27;s &quot;Mothers Pride&quot;. The song was also covered by The Jam live at the 100 Club on 11 September 1977, a version released on the six-CD set &quot;Fire and Skill – The Jam Live&quot; in 2015.

<text>The Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) is the architecture school of Columbia University, a private research university in New York City. It is also home to the Masters of Science program in Advanced Architectural Design, Historic Preservation, Real Estate Development, Urban Design, and Urban Planning.

The school&#x27;s resources include the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, the United States&#x27; largest architectural library and home to some of the first books published on architecture, as well as the origin of the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals.

Recent deans of the school have included architects James Stewart Polshek (1972–1987), Bernard Tschumi (1988–2003), Mark Wigley (2004–2014), Amale Andraos (2014–2021), Weiping Wu (Interim Dean, 2022), and Andrés Jaque (2022–present).

==History==
The Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP) has evolved over more than a century. It was transformed from a department within the Columbia School of Mines into a formal School of Architecture by William Robert Ware in 1881—making it one of the first such professional programs in the country.

While the number of specialized programs being offered by the school has increased over the years, architecture remains the intellectual core of the school.

==Rankings==
Columbia GSAPP has been ranked #2 among the Top Architecture Graduate Programs five times over the past ten years on &quot;Design Intelligence&#x27;s&quot; ranking of programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board, including the 2020 rankings.

==Research Centers==
===Center for Spatial Research===
The Spatial Research Center was established in 2015 as a center for urban research that combines design, architecture, urbanism, humanities, and data science. It sponsors research, and curricular activities built around new technologies of mapping, data visualization, data collection and data analysis.

===Center for Urban Real Estate===
The Center for Urban Real Estate was founded in 2011 in order to address the challenges of an urbanization and the complex problems of the real estate industry. From inequitable socio-economic outcomes in the urban environment, through the revitalization of urban centers, to creating technological systems for optimized investment decisions, the Center serves as a forum for discussions and analysis by real estate professionals and scholars. A focus of the Center is the development of technology that meets needs of the real estate industry integrated with advanced research and resources in technology within the Columbia University ecosystem.

===Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture===
The Buell Center was founded in 1982. Its mission is to advance the interdisciplinary study of American architecture, urbanism, and landscape. In recent years, the Center has convened issue-oriented conversations around matters of public concern, such as housing, that are addressed to overlapping constituencies including academics, students, professionals, and members of the general public. The Center&#x27;s research and programming articulate facts and frameworks that modify key assumptions in which public analysis and debate about architecture and urbanism takes place. The center is located in Buell Hall.

===Columbia Laboratory for Architectural Broadcasting===

Columbia Laboratory for Architectural Broadcasting (also known as C-Lab) was founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Inaba. It is an experimental research unit which investigates how cities would evolve and studies urban and architecture issues related to new technologies.

<doc id="1170611" wikidata="Q1798019" url="?curid=1170611" title="LEON">
<text>LEON (from meaning lion) is a radiation-tolerant 32-bit central processing unit (CPU) microprocessor core that implements the SPARC V8 instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed by the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), part of the European Space Agency (ESA), without any involvement by Sun. Later versions have been designed by Gaisler Research, under a variety of owners. It is described in synthesizable VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). LEON has a dual license model: An GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and GNU General Public License (GPL) free and open-source software (FOSS) license that can be used without licensing fee, or a proprietary license that can be purchased for integration in a proprietary product.
The core is configurable through VHDL generics, and is used in system on a chip (SOC) designs both in research and commercial settings.

==History==
The LEON project was begun by the European Space Agency (ESA) in late 1997 to study and develop a high-performance processor to be used in European space projects.
The objectives for the project were to provide an open, portable and non-proprietary processor design, capable to meet future requirements for performance, software compatibility and low system cost. Another objective was to be able to manufacture in a single-event upset (SEU) tolerant sensitive semiconductor process. To maintain correct operation in the presence of SEUs, extensive error detection and error handling functions were needed. The goals have been to detect and tolerate one error in any register without software intervention, and to suppress effects from Single Event Transient (SET) errors in combinational logic.

The LEON family includes the first LEON1 VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) design that was used in the LEONExpress test chip developed in 0.25 μm technology to prove the fault-tolerance concept. The second LEON2 VHDL design was used in the processor device AT697 from Atmel (F) and various system-on-chip devices. These two LEON implementations were developed by ESA. Gaisler Research, now part of Frontgrade (previously Aeroflex and Cobham), developed the third LEON3 design and has announced the availability of the fourth generation LEON, the LEON4 processor.

==LEON processor models and distributions==
A LEON processor can be implemented in programmable logic such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or manufactured into an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). This section and the subsequent subsections focus on the LEON processors as soft IP cores and summarise the main features of each processor version and the infrastructure with which the processor is packaged, referred to as a LEON &quot;distribution&quot;.

All processors in the LEON series use the SPARC V8 reduced instruction set computer (RISC) ISA. LEON2(-FT) has a five-stage pipeline while later versions have a seven-stage pipeline. LEON2 and LEON2-FT are distributed as a system-on-chip design that can be modified using a graphical configuration tool. While the LEON2(-FT) design can be extended and re-used in other designs, its structure does not emphasise re-using parts of the design as building blocks or enable designers to easily incorporate new IP cores in the design.

The standard LEON2(-FT) distribution includes the following support cores:
* Interrupt controller
* Debug support unit with trace buffer
* Two 24-bit timers
* Two universal asynchronous receiver-transmitters (UARTs)
* 16-bit I/O port
* Memory controller.

The LEON3, LEON3FT, and LEON4 cores are typically used together with the GRLIB IP Library. While the LEON2 distributions contain one design that can be used on several target technologies, GRLIB contains several template designs, both for FPGA development boards and for ASIC targets that can be modified using a graphical configuration tool similar to the one in the LEON2 distribution. The LEON/GRLIB package contains a larger number of cores compared to the LEON2 distributions and also include a plug and play (PnP) extension to the on-chip Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) bus. IP cores available in GRLIB also include:

* 32-bit PC133 synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) controller
* 32-bit Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bridge with direct memory access (DMA)
* 10/100/1000 Mbit Ethernet media access control address (MAC address)
* 8/16/32-bit programmable read-only memory (PROM) and static random-access memory (SRAM) controller
* 16/32/64-bit DDR/DDR2 controllers
* Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 host and device controllers
* Controller area network (CAN) controller
* JTAG TAP controller
* Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) controller
* Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) controller
* Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) with first in, first out (FIFO)
* Modular timer unit
* Interrupt controller
* 32-bit general-purpose I/O (GPIO) port

===FPGA design flow===
Design flow documentation for the LEON into FPGA are available from the manufacturer and from third party resources.

===Terminology===
The term LEON2/LEON2-FT often refer to the LEON2 system-on-chip design, which is the LEON2 processor core together with the standard set of peripherals available in the LEON2(-FT) distribution. Later processors in the LEON series are used in a wide range of designs and are therefore not as tightly coupled with a standard set of peripherals. With LEON3 and LEON4 the name typically refers to only the processor core, while LEON/GRLIB is used to refer to the complete system-on-chip design.

===LEON2 processor core===
LEON2 has the following characteristics:

* The GNU LGPL allows a high degree of freedom of intervention on the freely available source code.
* Configurability is a key feature of the project, and is achieved through the usage of VHDL generics.
* It offers all basic functions of a pipelined in-order processor.
* It is a fairly sized VHDL project (about 90 files, for the complete LEON2 distribution, including peripheral IP cores)

===LEON2-FT processor core===
The LEON2-FT processor is the single-event upset fault tolerant (FT) version of the LEON2 processor. Flip-flops are protected by triple modular redundancy and all internal and external memories are protected by EDAC or parity bits. Special licence restrictions apply to this IP (distributed by the European Space Agency). Among other satellites, the processor was used in ESA&#x27;s Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) in 2015 and China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 lunar lander.

===LEON3 processor core===
The LEON3 is a synthesisable VHDL model of a 32-bit processor compliant with the SPARC V8 architecture. The model is highly configurable, and particularly suitable for system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. The full source code is available under the GNU GPL license, allowing use for any purpose without licensing fee. LEON3 is also available under a proprietary license, allowing it to be used in proprietary applications.

There are several differences between the two LEON2 processor models and the LEON3. LEON3 includes SMP support and a seven-stage pipeline, while LEON2 does not support SMP and has a five-stage pipeline.

===LEON3FT processor core===
The LEON3FT is a fault-tolerant version of the standard LEON3 SPARC V8 Processor. It has been designed for operation in the harsh space environment, and includes functionality to detect and correct single-event upset (SEU) errors in all on-chip RAM memories. The LEON3FT processor supports most of the functionality in the standard LEON3 processor, and adds the following features:

* Register file SEU error-correction of up to 4 errors per 32-bit word
* Cache memory error-correction of up to 4 errors per tag or 32-bit word
* Autonomous and software transparent error handling
* No timing impact due to error detection or correction

The following features of the standard LEON3 processor are not supported by LEON3FT

* Local scratchpad RAM (neither for instruction nor for data)
* Cache locking
* LRR (least recently replaced) cache replacement algorithm

The LEON3FT core is distributed together with a special FT version of the GRLIP IP library. Only netlist distribution is possible.

An FPGA implementation called LEON3FT-RTAX was proposed for critical space applications., but it has been discontinued.

===LEON4 processor core===
In January 2010, the fourth version of the LEON processor was released. This release has the following new features:
* Static branch prediction added to pipeline
* Optional level-2 cache
* 64-bit or 128-bit path to AMBA AHB interface
* Higher performance possible (claimed by manufacturer: 1.7 DMIPS/MHz as opposed to 1.4 DMIPS/MHz of LEON3)
* Rad hardened.

===LEON5 processor core===
Under development.

== Real-time OS support ==
The Real-time operating systems that support the LEON core are currently RTLinux, PikeOS, eCos, RTEMS, Nucleus, ThreadX, OpenComRTOS, VxWorks (a port by Gaisler Research), LynxOS (also a port by Gaisler Research), POK (a free ARINC653 implementation released under the BSD licence) and ORK+, an open-source real-time kernel for high-integrity real-time applications with the Ravenscar Profile, Embox an open-source configurable real-time OS which allows using Linux software without Linux.

<text>The Columbia University School of the Arts (also known as School of the Arts or SoA) is the fine arts graduate school of Columbia University in Morningside Heights, New York. It offers Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees in Film, Visual Arts, Theatre and Writing, as well as the Master of Arts (MA) degree in Film Studies. It also works closely with the Arts Initiative at Columbia University (CUArts) and organizes the Columbia University Film Festival (CUFF), a week-long program of screenings, screenplay, and teleplay readings.

Founded in 1965, the school is one of the leading institutions for the study of visual and performing arts in the United States. Among the school&#x27;s distinguished graduates are sculptors David Altmejd and Banks Violette, visual artist Lisi Raskin, painters Marc Handelman and Dana Schutz, screenwriter Jennifer Lee and James Mangold, screenwriter and actress Gülse Birsel and directors Kathryn Bigelow and James Gunn.

== History ==

The history of the School of Arts can be traced back to the first courses in drawing offered at Columbia in 1881. In 1900, drama critic Brander Matthews was appointed professor of Dramatic Literature, first chair of drama at any university in the country. Courses in creative writing, film, and painting followed. In 1921, the Department of Fine Arts was established for the study of architecture, painting, sculpture and scholarly works in those fields. The university&#x27;s first sculpture classes were offered in 1936, followed two years later by graphic art classes. In 1947, the School of Painting and Sculpture, and the School of Dramatic Arts were established.

In December 1965, the Trustees of Columbia established the School of the Arts to train both graduate and undergraduate students. In 1970, the school began offering only graduate courses. A year later, it moved into Dodge Hall at Broadway and 116th Street and Prentis Hall on 125th Street, where the school’s classrooms, rehearsal spaces and administrative offices are located. In 1988, the Miller Theatre, constructed in 1924, was established as Columbia&#x27;s performing arts producer following renovations to the previous space known as the McMillin Academic Theatre. In 2017, construction was completed on Renzo Piano&#x27;s 60,000-square-foot Lenfest Center for the Arts, a multidisciplinary academic and performance space on Columbia&#x27;s Manhattanville campus. The Lenfest also houses the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery.

In 2021, the School of Arts was the subject of a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; investigative report into prestigious universities that run programs that have lopsided costs for students relative to their expected earnings in the field. According to the &quot;Journal,&quot; &quot;Columbia has more high-debt master&#x27;s degree programs in low-paying fields than any other Ivy League university.&quot; The article further stated alumni carry a median debt of $181,000 USD, &quot;the highest debt compared with earnings among graduates of any major university master’s program in the U.S.&quot;

== Programs ==

=== Film ===
The School of the Arts&#x27; Film Program is well-regarded in the field and offers Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees with concentrations in Screenwriting/Directing and Creative Producing. The program also offers a Master of Arts (M.A.) in Film Studies.

In 2016, the MFA film program accepted 72 students out of approximately 600 applicants. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked it number four in the top 25 American film schools of 2020.

=== Theater ===
The School of Arts&#x27;s Theatre Program offers Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees in theater with concentrations in acting, directing, playwriting, dramaturgy, stage management, and theater management and producing. The playwriting concentration has been heralded by two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage and Tony Award winner David Henry Hwang.

In 2018, applications to the acting concentration doubled with the appointment of former Yale School of Drama acting professor Ron Van Lieu. The acting concentration has emerged as one of the highest ranking graduate acting programs in the world and is helmed by casting director James Calleri.

The Theatre Program also offers a Ph.D. and joint J.D./M.F.A. degree in association with Columbia Law School.

=== Visual Arts ===
In the Visual Arts Program at the School of Arts, students work in the fields of painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, digital media, drawing, performance, and video art.

=== Writing ===
The School of Arts&#x27;s writing program offers degrees in creative writing, with concentrations in fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. One of its more notable features are &quot;master classes&quot;, four-week courses for writers (as opposed to critical scholars) &quot;designed to stimulate provocative discussions about literary craft and artistic choices.&quot; Master class faculty have included Helen Vendler, Jonathan Lethem, Colson Whitehead, James Wood, Richard Ford, Han Ong, Susan Choi and Jonathan Ames. The writing division also employs prestigious writers as seminar and workshop instructors; in recent years these have included Zadie Smith, Gary Shteyngart, Nathan Englander, Myla Goldberg, Adam Haslett, Jessica Hagedorn, Phillip Lopate, Marie Howe, Eamon Grennan, Paul LaFarge, David Gates, Francisco Goldman, Darcy Frey and David Ebershoff.

<doc id="1170621" wikidata="Q2698384" url="?curid=1170621" title="Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)">
<text>Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a 1969 British-American musical film directed by Herbert Ross. The screenplay by Terence Rattigan is based on James Hilton&#x27;s 1934 novella &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, which was first adapted for the screen in 1939.

==Plot==
In 1924, Arthur Chipping, or &quot;Chips&quot;, is an established member of the teaching staff at Brookfield School, a public school just outside of London. A stodgy teacher of Latin and Greek, he is disliked by his pupils, who find him boring and call him &quot;Ditchy&quot;, short for &quot;dull as ditchwater&quot;. In the dining room of the Savoy Hotel, on the eve of his summer holiday, Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette. Dissatisfied with her career and social circle, and depressed by her romantic entanglements, Katherine sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and by chance is reunited with Chips in Paestum, where the pair spend a nice day together. Seeing in &quot;Mr Chips&quot; a lonely soul similar to herself, Katherine arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and they soon fall in love. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips&#x27; charm to be irresistible. The marriage softens Chips, and his students begin to like him more.

When the wealthy Lord Sutterwick learns who Chips has married, he announces his intention to deprive Brookfield of a planned financial endowment because of Katherine&#x27;s background, but Katherine threatens to reveal Sutterwick&#x27;s past dalliance with her friend Ursula Mossbank, and Sutterwick relents. However, when the headmaster of Brookfield retires in 1939, Sutterwick uses his influence to fill the open position with a teacher at Brookfield who is less senior than Chips. The new headmaster serves until 1944, at which point Chips is given his long-awaited promotion. Before he can give Katherine the news, she is killed by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Chips retires after the war is over, but he stays involved at Brookfield, and is comforted by visits from his former pupils and his memories of Katherine.

==Production==
===Development===
A draft of a musical adaptation of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was on file in the MGM script department as early as 1951. In 1964, trade magazine advertisements announced that Julie Andrews, fresh from her success in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, was to star in a &quot;Mr. Chips&quot; musical opposite Rex Harrison, with Vincente Minnelli as director, but nothing came of the project. When work resumed a few years later, there were numerous pre-production problems, among them several changes in the casting of the lead roles. Richard Burton and Samantha Eggar were signed, and then Lee Remick replaced Eggar. When Gower Champion, who had replaced Minnelli as director, viewed raw footage of Petula Clark in &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968), he fired Remick and replaced her with Clark. Remick sued MGM for damages, and Burton balked at playing opposite a &quot;pop singer&quot;, so he was replaced by Peter O&#x27;Toole. Siân Phillips, O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s wife, was cast as Ursula Mossbank, a character said to have been inspired by actress Tallulah Bankhead. Champion eventually left the project, and the film ultimately became the first-time directorial effort of choreographer Herbert Ross.

The songs in the film were written by Leslie Bricusse, who replaced André and Dory Previn. Clark&#x27;s two musical production numbers were choreographed by Ross&#x27; wife Nora Kaye. Ken Adam served as the film&#x27;s art director, and Julie Harris designed the costumes.

===Filming===
Much of the film was made on location. In Italy, scenes were shot in Campania, Capaccio, Naples, Paestum, Pompeii, and Positano. In London, 59 Strand-on-the-Green in Chiswick served as Katherine&#x27;s home, and the Salisbury, a popular bar in the West End theatre district, was the setting for a scene in which Chips and Katherine share a drink after watching a performance of &quot;Medea&quot;. Sherborne School in Dorset stood in for the fictional Brookfield School, and scenes were also filmed in the town of Sherborne. Two 4-LAV electric multiple-unit train engines (numbers 2924 and 2943) that had been withdrawn from the Brighton Main Line were hauled down to Sherborne Station in October 1968 for filming, before being scrapped on 22 October.

===Differences from novella and 1939 film===
Terence Rattigan&#x27;s screenplay diverged significantly from Hilton&#x27;s novella and the 1939 film adaptation. Firstly, the time frame of the story was advanced by several decades, starting in the 1920s, continuing through the Second World War, and ending in the late 1960s. Also, the musical does not show Chipping&#x27;s first arrival at Brookfield School but starts with him already an established member of the teaching staff. Additionally, Rattigan made the character of Katherine Bridges a music hall soubrette and has her get killed by a V-1 flying bomb after being married to Chips for two decades, rather than dying in childbirth after a much shorter marriage. Finally, the character&#x27;s name changes slightly, from Charles Edward Chipping to Arthur Chipping.

A limited-edition 3-CD set of the complete score, including alternative versions of songs and discarded numbers, was released by the Film Score Monthly Silver Age Classics label in 2006.

==Release==
The film had its premiere at the Palace Theatre in New York City on 5 November 1969.

After the film&#x27;s initial roadshow bookings, and before it was released in neighborhood theaters, many of the musical numbers were deleted, even though many of them were instrumental in explaining the characters&#x27; inner thoughts and emotions. The shortened version of the film was used for its initial television network broadcasts, but the complete version has been shown on TCM. Intervening years have brought a new appreciation for it, as well as John Williams&#x27; underscore and orchestrations.

The film had a Royal European premiere on 24 November 1969 at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, attended by Queen Elizabeth II, before normal performances at the theatre from 25 November.

===Home media===
The film was released in anamorphic widescreen format on Region 1 DVD by Warner Home Video on January 29, 2009. This release has audio tracks in English and Japanese, and subtitles in English, French, Japanese, and Thai. The only bonus features are the trailers for this film and the 1939 adaptation of Hilton&#x27;s novel.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Reviews for the film were lukewarm, although both O&#x27;Toole and Clark were universally praised for their performances and the obvious chemistry between them. According to &quot;Seventeen&quot;: &quot;Rarely have a pair of players been so marvelously in tune with each other as Peter O&#x27;Toole and Petula Clark.&quot;

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby said: &quot;[Peter O&#x27;Toole] has never been better. Having been forced to abandon his usual mechanical flamboyance, he gives Chips an air of genuine, if seedy, grandeur that shines through dozens of make-up changes… Miss Clark is a fine rock singer with the quality of a somewhat tough Julie Andrews (which I like and is not to be confused with Miss Andrews&#x27;s steely cool)… The film is the first directorial effort of Herbert Ross…the sort of director who depends heavily on the use of the zoom, the boom and the helicopter, which gives the movie the contradictory look of a mod-Victorian valentine…[he] has handled the musical sequences…more or less as soliloquies. O&#x27;Toole talks his with such charm that I almost suspected he was lip-syncing Rex Harrison&#x27;s voice, and Miss Clark belts hers in good, modified Streisand style.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed: &quot;&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; uses its budget quietly, with good taste, and succeeds in being a big movie without being a gross one. I think I enjoyed it about as much as any road show since &quot;Funny Girl&quot;. And that surprised me, since so much of the critical reaction has been negative. Even at its worst, &quot;Chips&quot; is inoffensive in its sentimentality. At its best, it&#x27;s the first film since &quot;The Two of Us&quot; that I genuinely feel deserves to be called heartwarming…the Hilton story was a best seller but hardly a work of art. By modernizing the action, Rattigan has made it possible for the movie to mirror changes in the English class structure during the two decades when it was most obviously becoming obsolete… As the schoolmaster and his wife, Peter O&#x27;Toole and Petula Clark are exactly right. O&#x27;Toole succeeds in creating a character that is aloof, chillingly correct, terribly reserved—and charming all the same…Miss Clark carries most of the musical duties in the film, and carries them well…one of the best things about &quot;Chips&quot; is that Ross has concentrated on telling his story and hasn&#x27;t let the songs intrude.&quot;

In &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine, Rex Reed enthused: &quot;I think I&#x27;m in love with Petula Clark. If she had come along twenty years ago, a time the screen knew a mercurial presence when it saw one, she would have been a much bigger star than she ever has a chance of being now. The playing is superb. Peter O&#x27;Toole is a prim and angular Chips who wears a look of permanent insecurity; Miss Clark is a soft, sweet-smelling, dimpled doughnut with powdery cheeks and witty anxiety, like a new Jean Arthur. Together they are perfect counterparts… &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; is, I&#x27;m afraid, very square indeed, but thanks to an idyllic cast and a magnificent director, there is so much love and beauty in it that it made my heart stop with joy. I found it all quite irresistible.&quot;

Archer Winsten of the &quot;New York Post&quot; stated: &quot;[It] has been produced in England in surroundings of inevitable authenticity and taste, with performers of extraordinary talent and range, and the results are here for all of us to share the sentimental warmth…that O&#x27;Toole performance is a gem, and Petula Clark knows exactly how to enhance its brilliance, and her own, most effectively.&quot;

In &quot;Life&quot;, Richard Schickel wrote: &quot;Petula Clark…is fresh and charming. Together with O’Toole she provides the firm, bright core for a film always in danger of becoming mushy. Nearly unaided, they make the old thing work—and make it worthwhile.&quot;

A reviewer for the British Channel 4 felt that &quot;the main problem with turning the film into a musical is that the songs lack the emotion that the story really needs… That said, O&#x27;Toole is superb as Chips and Clark charming as the woman who dramatically changes his life.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on review from 6 critics, with an average score of 7.0/10.

===Accolades===

<text>Boucheron () is a French luxury jewelry and watch house located in Paris, 26 Place Vendôme, owned by Kering. Hélène Poulit-Duquesne has been CEO since 2015 and Claire Choisne creative director since 2011.

==History==
===At the origins===
The House of Boucheron is a French family dynasty founded by Frederic Boucheron in 1858, with the opening of his first store in the Galerie de Valois, at Palais-Royal, during the heyday of the Second French Empire. He created his atelier in 1866 and a year later won the Gold Medal during the Exposition Universelle (1867).

Paul Legrand (1840-1910) worked as the chief designer for the house of Boucheron from 1863-1867, and again 1871-1892. He is credited with the idea of combining pearls with diamond rondelles, first seen in Boucheron products in 1889. The &quot;rondelle&quot; cut of diamonds was pioneered by Bordinckx, who was also associated with Boucheron. While Legrand was head designer, in 1879, Boucheron developed a clasp-less necklace, which was part of its show which won a Grand Prix for Outstanding Innovation in a Jewellery Collection at the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair. Legrand was also influential in the design of the &quot;Plume de Paon&quot; (Peacock&#x27;s Feather) design, which has featured in Boucheron collections since Legrand and Frédéric Boucheron created it in 1866. It featured in the Point d&#x27;Interrogation necklace, which was bought by Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich Romanov. This necklace was also featured in the World&#x27;s Fair-winning collection.

In 1893, Frédéric Boucheron became the first jeweler to move to Place Vendôme. Legend has it that he chose 26 Place Vendôme, where Boucheron remains to this day, because it was the sunniest corner of the square. He believed that the diamonds in the windows would sparkle all the more brilliantly.

In 1893, Boucheron opened a store in Moscow, later transferred to St Petersburg in 1911; in 1903 a store in London and an office in New York. More store openings followed in Japan in 1973, Shanghai, Dubai in 2005, and finally Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur in 2006.

During the Art Nouveau period, Boucheron also became known for sculpted designs, often combining chased, enameled gold set with gems and pâte-de-verre. One such example, a gold belt buckle featuring two lionesses biting into a carnelian above a green pâte-de-verre lion&#x27;s head, demonstrates the brand’s intricate, nature-inspired motifs.

===The royal years===
In 1878, the Russian Prince Felix Youssoupoff purchased a corsage decorated with 6 detachable diamond bows during one of his visits to Paris.

In 1921, Boucheron was commissioned to make a tiara for Lady Greville which was later given to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Her grandson Prince Charles passed the tiara on to his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

Queen Elizabeth II also had a collection of Boucheron jewels.

In 1928, the Maharaja of Patiala asked Boucheron to set the stones of his treasure, which were brought to the Place Vendôme boutique by the prince.
Other royal patrons of Boucheron have included Maharajah Sir Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, Riza Shah Pahlevi, Queen Farida of Egypt and Queen Rania of Jordan.

===Collections===
One of the first lines created was the symbolic snake line in the 1970s.

Solange Azagury-Partridge was appointed Creative Director in 2001, she held the position for three years. 2002 saw the launch of the &quot;Beauté Dangereuse&quot; and &quot;Cinna Pampilles&quot; collections, &quot;Not Bourgeois&quot; launched the following year.

In 2004, the &quot;Jaipur&quot; High Jewellery line and the &quot;Déchaînée&quot; collection are launched.

2005 is a very creative year for the House of Boucheron: the &quot;Trouble,&quot; &quot;Quatre,&quot; &quot;Diablotine,&quot; &quot;Vingt-Six&quot; and &quot;Trouble Désir&quot; jewelry lines are launched.

In 2006 &quot;Exquises Confidences&quot; is launched, and a year later &quot;Fleurs Fatales&quot; high jewelry collection makes its debut.

In 2010, Boucheron unveiled a colorful jewelry range to enhance its &quot;Cinna Pampilles&quot; collection.

In 2011, the &quot;Cabinet of Curiosities&quot; line was launched.

===Collaborations===
In 1996 Boucheron collaborated with Waterman Paris to produce the limited edition, &quot;Edson signe Boucheron.&quot; The nib was made of 18K solid gold with the body of the pen being of a blue translucent Resin. The retail price was €2000 / $2700 / £1700 and limited to only 3471 pieces (this number is the sum of the years of foundation of Waterman, 1883, and Boucheron, 1858). The pen remains one of the most sought after pieces within the fine writing category.

In 2006, Boucheron and Alexander McQueen collaborated to create a limited-edition Novak bag that incorporates the snake motif of Boucheron&#x27;s Trouble line.

The beginning of a collaboration between Boucheron and Swiss watchmaker Girard-Perregaux started a year later in 2007, amongst which feature the LadyHawk Tourbillon and the limited Boucheron tribute watch.

In 2010, Boucheron and MB&amp;F launched the HM3 JwlryMachine timepiece.

===Boucheron today===
Boucheron was a family business; after the death of its founder Frédéric Boucheron in 1902, his descendants took over the business. In 1994, the family business shifted to a more global approach with its selling out to Schweizerhall.

The House of Boucheron was then acquired by former Gucci in 2000, which was bought by PPR in 2004. Pierre Bouissou was appointed CEO in April 2011 and was replaced by Helene Poulit-Duquesne in July 2015. It has 34 boutiques worldwide and an online e-commerce website launched in 2007. Claire Choisne was appointed Creative Director in 2011. The company&#x27;s estimated sales (in 2010/2011) were €50 million in total sales and €5 million in watches.

Boucheron pieces continue to appear at notable events like the Cannes Film Festival and the Oscars. Noted wearers include celebrities such as Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman, Eva Green, and Emma Watson, reflecting the brand’s contemporary appeal.

==Products==

Boucheron makes watches, and jewelry, and licenses its marque for perfumes. The watch and jewelry making segments have existed for over 150 years. The first fragrance, &quot;Boucheron,&quot; was launched in 1988. Over 22 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fragrances have been released. Since 2011 Boucheron fragrances have been created, produced and distributed under license by Interparfums.

==Boucheron International Rating of Diamonds==

Boucheron has compiled a classification system by which to determine the value of a diamond, developed on the basis of the diamond&#x27;s international currency. The Boucheron method of appreciation has been registered under the name B.I.R.D. (Boucheron International Rating of Diamonds). This original classification system is based on an evaluation of diamond quality and relies on a combined analysis of two criteria: first, the degree of clarity and second, the colour of the stone. The point at which these two variables, &quot;clarity&quot; and &quot;colour&quot; intersect gives rise to a mark of appreciation of between 90/100 and 99/100 for the quality of the diamond. A mark of 100/100 would indicate that a stone possesses the ultimate degree of perfection, according to Boucheron&#x27;s criteria.

==Vertu mobile phone==
In a joint venture with the mobile phone brand Vertu, Boucheron created the world&#x27;s first High Jewelry limited edition cell phones out of gold and precious stones. This collaboration continued with the 150th anniversary celebration with a new line of 7 Vertu mobile phones inspired by Boucheron&#x27;s High Jewellery &quot;Enchanting Boucheron&quot; anniversary collection. There are only eight pieces of the Cobra model in rose gold set all round with rubies and a pear-cut diamond and emerald eyes. Entwined around a rose gold case, the Python model, a serpent set with multi-coloured sapphires, diamonds and two sapphires, will be brought out in 26 pieces, as a reference to the famous jeweler&#x27;s address, 26 place Vendôme.

==Retail== 
Boucheron operates 34 shops worldwide, including Paris, Cannes, Saint-Tropez, Monaco, Beirut, London, San Francisco, Tokyo, Saitama, Yokohama, Fukuoka, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Okayama, Nagoya, Taipei, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Baku, Moscow, Toronto, Almaty, and Kuwait. The brand is also sold at 100 certified retailers.

<text>The School of Nursing is the graduate school of nursing at Columbia University in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1892, it stands as one of the oldest nursing schools in the United States.

The School of Nursing was the first nursing school to award a master&#x27;s degree in a clinical specialty. The school was the first to be elected a World Health Organization Collaborating Center for International Nursing Development in Advanced Practice.

==History==
After Presbyterian Hospital was established in 1872, administrators had trouble finding competent staff and recognized a need for qualified nurses. In 1892, the School of Nursing was founded as the Presbyterian Hospital Training School for Nurses, with Anna C. Maxwell serving as its first dean. The early curriculum at the school, taught mostly by physicians, included such varied subjects as hygiene of the sickroom, bacteriology, anatomy, bandaging, symptomatology, surgical diseases, obstetrics and gynecology, contagious diseases, nervous cases, Swedish massage, and cooking for the homebound. On May 15, 1894, 21 students, all females, became members of the first graduating class. Maxwell Hall opened within the new Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in 1928. In 1937, the nursing school formally became affiliated with Columbia University. The first Bachelor of Science degrees were awarded to students in 1940.

In 1956, the School of Nursing became the first in the country to award a master&#x27;s degree in a clinical nursing specialty. The emphasis on clinical scholarship is considered appropriate due to collaboration of the School of Nursing with other professional schools at Columbia. In 1984, the school&#x27;s new home became the Georgian Building. In 2017, the nursing school moved into a new 68,000-square-foot building designed by the architectural firms of FXFOWLE in New York and CO Architects in Los Angeles. The School of Nursing shares the Columbia University Medical Center campus with the School of Public Health, the School of Dental and Oral Surgery, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The school has clinical partnerships at over 200 clinical practice sites throughout New York City. The School of Nursing also has affiliations with three major medical centers: New York-Presbyterian, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Mount Sinai Morningside.

==Academics==
The School of Nursing offers a number of degree programs for the training of Registered Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, Certified Nurse Midwives, Nurse Anesthetists, Clinical Nurse Leaders, and Nurse-Scientists.

It offers a 15-month accelerated Master&#x27;s Direct Entry (MDE) program for non-nurse college graduates. A Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program for established Registered Nurses (Lateral-entry) or through their combined (MDE/DNP) seamless entry option, offering six Advanced Practice specialties: Adult-Gerontology Acute Care NP, Adult-Gerontology Primary Care NP, Family NP, Nurse-Midwifery, Pediatric-Primary Care NP, and Psychiatric-Mental Health NP. The school also offers a competitive Master of Science degree in Nurse Anesthesia, and a Master of Clinical Management and Leadership. A research-based Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D) degree is also offered, with research focus areas across the gamma of healthcare.

The clinical-based Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) degree was first developed by the school&#x27;s faculty in 2004 as one of the first such programs in the nation. The additional competencies embodied in this degree were based on the experience and outcomes research of the clinical faculty. It is the first &#x27;advanced practice&#x27; doctorate involving direct and comprehensive patient care of a panel of patients across sites and over time in the whole country.

As clinical evidence is both built from and applied to practice, the School of Nursing provides its students with the Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (ACNP) program in order to achieve evidence-based practice(EBP). The ACNP program was reconfigured to incorporate both theoretical and practical skills to foster an approach to clinical care geared toward older adults and persons with disabilities. The 47-credit masters ACNP program consist of core courses, supporting sciences, and specialty courses.

Core courses and supporting sciences for all nurse practitioners include physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, introduction to primary care, advanced physical assessment, genetics, health and social policy, and theory and research.

In June 2017, the School of Nursing moved into a new seven story-building at the corner of West 168th Street and Audubon Avenue, at the east end of the Columbia University Medical Center campus in northern Manhattan. The 68,000-square-foot glass structure was designed by CO|FXFOWLE, a joint venture of two award-winning architecture firms. The building includes the Helene Fuld Health Trust Simulation Center to help students learn complex clinical techniques and includes a mock in-patient room, exam room, critical care unit, an operation room, and three teaching skill labs.

<doc id="1170640" wikidata="Q5170158" url="?curid=1170640" title="Core Curriculum (Columbia College)">
<text>The Core Curriculum was originally developed as the main curriculum used by Columbia College of Columbia University in 1919. Created in the wake of World War I, it became the framework for many similar educational models throughout the United States, and has played an influential role in the incorporation of the concept of Western civilization into the American college curriculum. Today, customized versions of the Core Curriculum are also completed by students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of General Studies, the other two undergraduate colleges of Columbia University.

Later in its history, especially in the 1990s, it became a heavily contested form of learning, seen by some as an appropriate foundation of a liberal arts education, and by others as a tool of promoting a Eurocentric or Anglocentric society by solely focusing on the works of &quot;dead white men&quot;. Largely driven by student protests, the Core in recent decades has been revised to add focus on non-Western cultures, as well as postcolonial works to the literature and philosophy sequences. The most recent major addition to the Core was made in the 2000s with the addition of &quot;Frontiers of Science&quot;, a scientific literacy course, to the curriculum.

==History==

=== Early curricula ===

Early instruction at Columbia College, from its founding in 1754 as King&#x27;s College, almost entirely revolved around the study of the classics, and entering students were expected to already be fluent in Ancient Greek and Latin. Through most of the 19th century, all students were prescribed a single course of studies, save for a period of time beginning in 1830, when the college introduced the &quot;Literary and Scientific course&quot; in addition to the standard curriculum, which was dubbed the &quot;Full course&quot;. The former was open to the public with no expectations of attendance, and was discontinued in 1843. In the &quot;Full course&quot;, as set out in the 1843 revision of the college&#x27;s statutes, in addition to four years of the classics and German, freshmen were to study algebra, geometry, and English grammar and composition; sophomores, trigonometry and solid geometry, levelling, navigation, chemistry, physics, and rhetoric; juniors, &quot;practical astronomy&quot;, chemistry, geology, the &quot;principles of taste and criticism&quot;, logic, and English and modern European literature; seniors, differential and integral calculus, mechanics, philosophy and religion, and English composition. The adoption of mandatory German was made that year, following a $20,000 bequest from Frederick Gebhard which established the university&#x27;s German department, though it was soon made optional in 1847.

By the late-19th century, many American universities, including Harvard, had seen a trend towards more elective programs. President Frederick A. P. Barnard was an early supporter of this movement—in 1872, Yale President Noah Porter criticized him as one of &quot;the educational reformers who should know better&quot; for his advocacy in favor of elective curricula and his support for Charles William Eliot of Harvard. During his tenure he managed to establish a system wherein roughly half of a student&#x27;s courses would be electives, and the other half required by the faculty, though his stance would lose ground at the college over the following decades. However, this began to change starting in the 1880 with the introduction of the modern language requirement; Columbia dropped Ancient Greek as an entrance examination requirement in 1897, and Latin in 1916. This gradual thaw, along with university&#x27;s move to Morningside Heights just prior to World War I, set the stage for a major change in curricular focus in the early 20th century.

===&quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot;===

In 1917, the United States Army commissioned the university to create a &quot;war issues&quot; course in order to educate the Student Army Training Corps, and to explain the causes of WWI and the reasons for US involvement in the conflict. Following the war, in 1919, this course was transformed into &quot;Contemporary Civilization,&quot; the oldest course of the Core Curriculum, which faculty presented as a &quot;peace issues&quot; course intended to confront the realities of the post-war era. Writing about &quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot;, Dean Herbert Hawkes stated that &quot;its significance rested on the fundamental principle that in the long run man&#x27;s accomplishment can rise no higher than his ideals, and that an understanding of the worth of the cause for which one is fighting is a powerful weapon in the hands of an intelligent man.&quot;

In 1928, &quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot; was enlarged and split into two courses: &quot;Introduction to Contemporary Civilization in the West&quot; or &quot;CC-A&quot;, focusing on Western history from 1200 to the present, and &quot;Contemporary Problems in the United States&quot; or &quot;CC-B&quot;, which emphasized questions of modern politics and economics. In 1932, &quot;CC-B&quot; was revised in the face of the Great Depression to center the questions of economic security, institutions, and policies. The course was dropped altogether in 1968, while the &quot;CC-A&quot; syllabus was overhauled to focus on politics and revolution in response to the 1968 student protests, and evolved into the course it is today.
=== The humanities sequence ===

The &quot;General Honors&quot; course was instituted in 1920, formed around a list of &quot;Great Books&quot; created by professor John Erskine, who would go on to create the core curriculum at the University of Chicago. The course was discontinued in 1929, but was resurrected three years later as the &quot;Colloquium in Important Books&quot;. The Great Books curriculum was officially incorporated into the Core in 1937 with the inauguration of the humanities sequence, which consisted of &quot;Humanities A&quot;, a first-year survey of Western literature and philosophy from classical antiquity to the end of the 18th century, and &quot;Humanities B&quot;, a sophomore elective that covered the visual arts and music. Structured after &quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot;, &quot;Humanities A&quot; expected students to read one book per week, a workload that placed unique burdens on freshmen. &quot;Humanities A&quot; would eventually morph into the modern &quot;Masterpieces of Western Literature&quot; course, while &quot;Humanities B&quot; split into &quot;Music Humanities&quot; and &quot;Art Humanities&quot; in 1941. The list of books read in &quot;Literature Humanities&quot; would constantly shift over time; the first female author to be included in the curriculum was Jane Austen with the addition of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; to the syllabus in 1985, two years after Columbia College became coeducational, while the first Black author to be incorporated into &quot;Literature Humanities&quot; was Toni Morrison, whose &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was added in 2015.

===Changes to the Core===
In the later half of the 20th century, many US universities moved towards a more elective system. Some historians see the change as a response to social activism—the civil rights, feminist, and various other social movements saw the Core Curriculum as an inflexible way to promote the canon of &quot;dead white males&quot; and as a failure to acknowledge the essential contributions of other global cultures. Others interpret it as a concession to increasing calls for earlier specialization to prepare students for post-graduate scientific and professional studies.

The Extended Core was created in 1990 following a report from professor Wm. Theodore de Bary in which he urged the university to expand the Core to include topics in non-Western cultures, in line with its original mission to facilitate discussion in contemporary issues. It consisted of a requirement that students take two courses in non-Western cultures from a list drawn up by the Committee on the Core Curriculum, and was soon renamed to &quot;Major Cultures&quot;. Following a 2007 hunger strike which called for increased funding ethnic studies, a reform of the Core, and revisions to the university&#x27;s Manhattanville expansion plan, Major Cultures was replaced in 2008 with the Global Core. The oldest course in the Global Core is the &quot;Colloquium on Major Texts&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Asian Humanities&quot;, a course on Asian classics which was established in 1947 by de Bary as &quot;Oriental Humanities&quot;.

The most recent addition to the Core is &quot;Frontiers of Science&quot;, which includes a set of analytical approaches that apply to all disciplines of science. &quot;Frontiers of Science&quot; is taught as four three-week units: two from the physical sciences and two from the life sciences.

==Structure==

===Requirements===
All first-year students in Columbia College must take the year-long &quot;Masterpieces of Western Literature&quot; course (also known as &quot;Literature Humanities&quot; or &quot;Lit Hum&quot;), the semester-long &quot;University Writing&quot; (&quot;UW&quot;), and the semester-long &quot;Frontiers of Science&quot; (&quot;FroSci&quot;). All sophomores are required to take a year of &quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot; (&quot;CC&quot;). The other requirements, which can be completed any year, include a semester of &quot;Masterpieces of Western Music&quot; (&quot;Music Humanities&quot; or &quot;Music Hum&quot;); a semester of &quot;Masterpieces of Western Art&quot; (&quot;Art Humanities&quot; or &quot;Art Hum&quot;); two semesters of science; four semesters of a foreign language; two semesters of the Global Core; and two semesters of physical education. Students are also required to pass a swimming test before receiving their diplomas, a common feature among Ivy League colleges.

Undergraduates in the School of Engineering and Applied Science take approximately half of Columbia College&#x27;s Core requirements. They are required to take either &quot;Literature Humanities&quot;, &quot;Contemporary Civilization&quot;, or the Global Core; either &quot;Art Humanities&quot; or &quot;Music Humanities&quot;; and &quot;University Writing&quot;; in addition to two semesters of physical education. The &quot;Technical Core&quot; consists of the semester-long &quot;The Art of Engineering&quot;, as well as requirements in calculus, chemistry, computer science, and physics.

<doc id="1170643" wikidata="Q860621" url="?curid=1170643" title="Queen Victoria Market">
<text>The Queen Victoria Market (also known colloquially as the Vic Market or Queen Vic) is a major landmark and public marketplace in the central business district (CBD) of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Covering over , it is the largest open air market in the Southern Hemisphere.

Constructed in stages from the 1860s and officially opened in 1878, the Queen Victoria Market is the last remaining major market in the CBD, and along with Prahran Market and South Melbourne Market, the last of the city&#x27;s Victorian era markets still operating. It is listed on both the Victorian Heritage Register and the National Heritage List, and is one of Melbourne&#x27;s major tourist sites, attracting approximately 10 million visitors annually.

==History==
===Earlier markets in Melbourne===
The Western Market was Melbourne&#x27;s first official fruit and vegetable market, established in 1841, six years after the city&#x27;s founding. It grew to take up an entire block bounded by Market, Collins and William streets in the central business district. The expansion of Melbourne to the east led to the establishment of the Eastern Market in the late 1840s, which quickly overtook the Western Market in popularity.

===Old Melbourne Cemetery===

The Queen Victoria Market was built and expanded over the site of the Old Melbourne Cemetery, which was the first British burial ground in Melbourne. Also known as Burial Hill, most of Melbourne&#x27;s early settlers were buried there, including the founder of the city John Batman.
The first person interred was a child by the name of William Goodman who was laid to rest on 13 May 1836. In July 1836, the burial of the first adult occurred, being that of the colonist Charles Franks, who was killed by Aboriginal people. The clan deemed responsible for Franks&#x27; murder were soon after annihilated during a punitive expedition.

The cemetery was officially closed to burials in 1854 but some legal and many illegal burials continued until 1917, and in 1920 it was estimated that a total of 10,000 graves existed on the site, though the exact number is unknown since the cemetery records were lost in a fire in 1864.

===Development into a market district===

After the cemetery&#x27;s partial closure, a number of small wholesale and retail markets were established around the site in the late 1850s to serve Melbourne&#x27;s rapidly growing population. The Lower Market (Deli Hall, Meat and Fish Hall, and H and I sheds) was originally set aside in 1857 for a fruit and vegetable market due to over-crowding at the Eastern Market. However, the location was contested due to its proximity to the cemetery, and proved unpopular with market gardeners who refused to use the space. This resulted in it serving as a livestock and hay market (the Meat Market Reserve) until 1867, when a substantial brick building (now the Meat and Fish Hall) was erected on the corner of Elizabeth and Victoria streets.

In 1876, the Victorian Government passed an Act officially gazetting the Old Melbourne Cemetery site as land to be reserved and developed into markets. A year later the part of the cemetery on the corner of Queen and Victoria streets where the unconsecrated burials of Aboriginal people and executed criminals were located, was the first area to be built upon. Before construction started, 28 skeletons were exhumed and re-interred at the Melbourne General Cemetery, including those of three Aboriginal men who had been executed in the 1840s.
===Official opening of Queen Victoria Market===

The Queen Victoria Market officially opened in March 1878, and it quickly expanded into wholesale and retail fruit and vegetable trading, which prompted the construction of G, H, I and J sheds. Shops were built along Elizabeth Street in 1880, and in 1884 the well-known Meat and Fish Hall façade was constructed.

By 1898, an average of 300 carts loaded with fresh vegetables and fruit from market gardens to the south east of the city arrived twice a week during the summer for sale in the market.

===Expansion===

In 1920, work to expand the markets to Peel Street were commenced. This involved building over the section of the old cemetery allocated for Jewish burials and also the graves of the first British colonists. Considerable public protest occurred to attempt to halt the development. Sir John Monash, who was Jewish, stated that if the project went ahead it &quot;would stamp Australians as a people devoid of sentiment and morality.&quot; A petition to the Prince of Wales to intervene in the development proved unsuccessful.

Work proceeded and between 1920 and 1922, 914 bodies were exhumed and re-buried in other cemeteries around Melbourne, notably at the new Fawkner Cemetery. By 1923 most of the remains of the prominent early settlers had been relocated, and the rest of the Old Melbourne Cemetery was ploughed up and prepared for the market expansion. Sheds K–L and M were built on part of the cleared cemetery, and when completed, the market had grown to occupy two city blocks: one rectangular block bounded by Victoria, Peel, Franklin and Elizabeth streets, and one eastern irregular block bounded by Queen, Victoria, Elizabeth and Therry streets.

In 1930, sixty brick stores were built at the Franklin Street end to house wholesale agents and merchants. However, this was short-lived due allegations of corruption and racketeering, and the findings of a royal commission led to the relocation of the Wholesale Market to Footscray in 1969. All that remains today of these stores is a row of shopfronts along Franklin Street.

===Threats of demolition===
A 1964 City of Melbourne report advocated for redevelopment of the site as a 1200 space car park, which would have become the largest in the city centre.

The separation of the Wholesale Market from the Retail Market led to a plan to redevelop the Queen Victoria Market site into a trade centre, office and hotel complex in the 1970s. However, public outcry and a green ban prevented this and resulted in the Market being classified by the National Trust. The Market site and its buildings were listed on the Historic Buildings Register.

===Present day===
The Queen Victoria Market survives today as the largest and most intact of Melbourne&#x27;s great nineteenth century markets. It is a major tourist destination in Melbourne, adding to its social and cultural significance. It is open every day of the week except Mondays and Wednesdays. On Wednesday evenings in the summer and winter months, a night market is held which offers dining, bars, live entertainment and a variety of other stalls. It offers a variety of fruit and vegetables, meat, poultry and seafood, gourmet and delicatessen foods as well as specialty delicacies. It also has a large non-food related market, selling a diverse range of clothing, shoes, jewellery and handmade arts and crafts.

Minor upgrades and re-development activities have continued from the late twentieth-century through to the present time. In 2003 the market was equipped with solar panels that harness enough energy to power all the market&#x27;s clients, and provide a surplus. In January 2010, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; reported that city planners wanted to transform the market into a &quot;gourmet hub&quot; by introducing upmarket food stalls. Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said he brought up the idea after visiting London&#x27;s Borough Market, which has a &quot;boutique&quot; feel that could work in Melbourne. In May 2015 the City of Melbourne draft 2015–16 budget allocated $80.64 million for investment in the Queen Victoria Market. Doyle and Environment Minister Greg Hunt announced the beginning of the process to nominate the market as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Architecture==

Many of the original structures remain intact, presenting visitors with nineteenth century streetscapes and a working market place. The Meat Hall, constructed in 1869, remains largely intact and is the oldest of the original buildings. The Elizabeth Street facade is predominantly intact in relation to its 1884 construction, while the arched north-west and south-east elevations are substantially intact in relation to their 1869 construction. The retail rows in Elizabeth and Victoria Streets, constructed between 1882 and 1891, are important and architecturally significant buildings, affording visitors the opportunity to shop in an extensive and intact 19th century streetscape.

<doc id="1170649" wikidata="Q1657799" url="?curid=1170649" title="Cortez Municipal Airport">
<text>Cortez Municipal Airport (Montezuma County Airport) is three miles southwest of Cortez, in Montezuma County, Colorado, United States. It has passenger service from one airline: Key Lime Air DBA Denver Air Connection.

== History ==
Its first scheduled passenger airline flights were operated by Monarch Airlines (1946-1950) with Douglas DC-3s in 1949. By 1977, Monarch successor Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) was operating Convair 580 turboprop service direct to Albuquerque and Denver as well as nonstop to nearby Farmington. Frontier had ceased serving Cortez by 1982.

Following cessation of service by Frontier, Cortez was served by several commuter air carriers over the years. During the mid-1980s, two airlines were serving the airport: Pioneer Airlines operating code sharing flights as Continental Express on behalf of Continental Airlines with direct service from Denver via a stop in Grand Junction flown with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner commuter propjets, and Trans-Colorado Airlines operating independently with direct service from Denver via a stop in Durango also flown with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner aircraft. In 1989, Mesa Airlines was the only air carrier serving Cortez with nonstop flights from Denver and direct flights from Albuquerque via a stop in Farmington both operated with Beechcraft commuter turboprops. By 1995, Mesa Airlines was operating code sharing flights as United Express on behalf of United Airlines with nonstop service from Denver and Farmington flown with Beechcraft 1900D and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia commuter propjets. In 2000, Great Lakes Airlines was operating code sharing service as United Express on behalf of United Airlines with nonstop Beechcraft 1900D flights to Denver. Great Lakes Airlines then operated nonstop Beechcraft 1900D service primarily to Denver as an independent air carrier from 2001 through 2016.

===U-2 Emergency Landing Incident===
A USAF Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft made an emergency nighttime forced landing at the Cortez Municipal Airport on August 3, 1959. Major Hsi-Chun Mike Hua was on a training flight originating at Laughlin AFB, Texas. The U-2 aircraft engine flamed out at 70,000 feet. Maj. Hua established glide and was able to navigate through a valley to a lighted airport that wasn&#x27;t on his map, nor did he know of its existence beforehand. The airport was the only one in the area with a runway that was lighted overnight.

==Facilities==
Cortez Municipal Airport covers 622 acres (252 ha) at an elevation of 5,918 feet (1,804 m). Its one runway, 3/21, is 7,205 by 100 feet (2,196 x 30 m) asphalt.

In 2019 the airport had 9,834 aircraft operations, average 27 per day: 86% general aviation, 13% air taxi, and &lt;1% military. 26 aircraft were then based at the airport: 85% single-engine, 1% multi-engine, and &lt;1% helicopter. The airport is an uncontrolled airport and has no control tower.

== Airline and destinations==


Denver Air Connection currently operates Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner turboprop aircraft on its flights serving Cortez.

<doc id="1170658" wikidata="Q7258622" url="?curid=1170658" title="Puerto Rican dry forests">
<text>The Puerto Rican dry forests are a tropical dry forest ecoregion located in southwestern and eastern Puerto Rico and on the offshore islands. They cover an area of . These forests grow in areas receiving less than of rain annually. Many of the trees are deciduous, losing their leaves during the dry season which normally lasts from December to April.

==Geography==
The dry forest life zone exist in two areas on the island of Puerto Rico - along the south coast of the island (in the dry orographic rain shadow of the Cordillera Central) and in the northeastern corner of the island near Fajardo, where the combination of low elevation and strong winds off the ocean result in a dry environment. Dry forests also exist on the adjacent off-shore islands of Culebra, Mona, Monito, Desecheo, Caja de Muertos, Cayo Santiago and most of the island of Vieques.

Dry forests along the south coast cover a strip of land from Guayama in the east to Cabo Rojo in the west, and extends inland from the coast.

==Climate==
The climate is seasonal with most rainfall between May and November. Average rainfall on the south coastal strip ranged from .

==Ecology==
Puerto Rican dry forests (like Caribbean dry forests in general) consist of short-stature (usually &lt; tall), multi-stemmed trees. The canopy is largely evergreen (dominated by &quot;Gymnanthes lucida&quot; in areas of limestone soil), while the emergent layer is considerably more dry-season deciduous. 

===Vegetation types===
Plant community types exist along a continuum of soil moisture availability, which is itself influenced by soil depth, and the orientation and the slope of the land (which affects runoff). Coastal vegetation includes mangrove, salt flats and beach thickets. Further inland, scrub forest grows on exposed limestone with scattered depressions. Deeper soils support deciduous forests with taller semi-evergreen forests growing on moister sites. The degree of deciduousness varies with water stress—drought–deciduous species retain more of their leaves in wetter years and lose more of them in drier years—and even in the deciduous forests, many trees are evergreen.

===Flora===
Puerto Rican dry forests are dominated by plants in the families Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Myrtaceae. In this regard they are similar to Jamaican dry forests, but differ from dry forests on the mainland of South and Central America, which are dominated by Fabaceae and Bignoniaceae.

&quot;Guaiacum officinale&quot;, &quot;Coccoloba venosa&quot;, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, and &quot;Capparis cynophallophora&quot; are common trees in coastal dry forests. Dry limestone forest species include &quot;Pisonia albida&quot;, &quot;Guaiacum sanctum&quot;, and &quot;Plumeria alba&quot;. &quot;Trichilia triacantha&quot;, a federally listed endangered species, is known only from the dry forest zone in southwestern Puerto Rico.

===Fauna===

Puerto Rican dry forest support a diverse avifauna; 185 bird species have been recorded in Guánica Forest including 15 endemic species. The endangered Puerto Rican nightjar is restricted to dry and moist forests in southwestern Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican crested toad, the only native toad in Puerto Rico, is known from only one remaining population in Guánica Forest.

Thirteen species of lizards are known from the southern dry forests including two anole endemic to the dry forest zone- &quot;Anolis poncensis&quot; and &quot;Anolis cooki&quot;. The Mona ground iguana is endemic to dry forest on the island of Mona.

Non-native mammals in the dry forest zone include rhesus macaques and patas monkeys, both of which have become serious agricultural pests, and the Javan mongoose which was introduced to Puerto Rico in the 1870s.

===Conservation===
Although most of the forest was destroyed for agriculture prior to the 1940s, some patches of forest which pre-date that period still exist. Areas that were used for charcoal production or for fence-posts have recovered rapidly - after 50 years forests that had been used for charcoal production recovered to the point where they were indistinguishable from much older forests.

In addition, large areas of secondary forest have grown back on abandoned agricultural land. Unlike areas which were only lightly used, these forests on abandoned farmland have far fewer species than do natural forests. Their path to recovery remains uncertain. 

The best example of dry forests in Puerto Rico are in the Guánica State Forest (&quot;Bosque Estatal de Guánica&quot;) outside the town of Guánica. This site has also been the focus of the vast majority of studies of dry forests. Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico include the Cabo Rojo, Culebra, Desecheo and Vieques wildlife refuges (part of the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex), the Caja de Muertos and the Mona and Monito Islands Natural Reserves, among other smaller protected areas along the southern coast of the island.

<doc id="1170663" wikidata="Q705198" url="?curid=1170663" title="The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (film)">
<text>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a 2000 American live-action/animated adventure slapstick comedy film directed by Des McAnuff and produced by Universal Pictures, based on the television cartoon series of the same name by Jay Ward. Animated characters Rocky and Bullwinkle share the screen with live actors portraying Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro, who also co-produced the film), Boris Badenov (Jason Alexander) and Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo) along with Randy Quaid, Piper Perabo, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. June Foray reprised her role as Rocky, while Keith Scott (no relation to original voice actor Bill Scott) voiced Bullwinkle and the film&#x27;s narrator. It also features cameo appearances by performers including James Rebhorn, Paget Brewster, Janeane Garofalo, John Goodman, David Alan Grier, Don Novello, Jon Polito, Carl Reiner, Whoopi Goldberg, Max Grodenchik, Norman Lloyd, Jonathan Winters and Billy Crystal. The film follows Rocky and Bullwinkle, who are enlisting their help by a young rookie FBI agent named Karen Sympathy to stop Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader from taking over the United States.

Released on June 30, 2000, the film underperformed at the box-office, grossing $35.1 million worldwide against its $76 million budget. It received mixed reviews with criticisms toward its writing, plot, and humor while praising the performances, visual effects, and faithfulness to its source material.

==Plot==
Rocky the Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose live a melancholic life ever since their television series was cancelled in 1964. Their animated home, Frostbite Falls, is deforested, Rocky can no longer fly, and their show&#x27;s unseen Narrator lives with his mother. Meanwhile, their archenemies, Fearless Leader, Boris Badenov, and Natasha Fatale, have all lost power in Pottsylvania following the end of the Cold War. They escape by tunneling to a Hollywood film studio, where they trick executive Minnie Mogul into signing a rights contract to their series and green-lighting a potential movie, dragging the villains out of the animated world and transforming them into live action characters.
Six months later, Fearless Leader and his minions have founded RBTV (&quot;Really Bad Television&quot;), a cable television network in New York City that is programmed to control the population by brainwashing American audiences into voting Fearless Leader in as the next President of the United States. FBI Director Cappy von Trapment deploys rookie agent Karen Sympathy to recruit Rocky and Bullwinkle to stop RBTV&#x27;s intended broadcast. Karen travels to a movie-generating lighthouse in Los Angeles, summoning Rocky, Bullwinkle, and the Narrator into the real world. 
Upon learning of Rocky and Bullwinkle&#x27;s return, Fearless Leader deploys Boris and Natasha to destroy them. They are given the CDI (&quot;Computer-Degenerating Imagery&quot;), a laptop-like weapon that can trap cartoon characters within the Internet. Their truck is stolen by Karen, who is swiftly arrested by Oklahoma State Police troopers when Natasha poses as her. Boris and Natasha later steal a helicopter to continue their pursuit. Karen is sent to prison but manipulates a love-struck Swedish guard named Ole to help her escape. Rocky and Bullwinkle are picked up by teens Martin and Lewis, who are students from Bullwinkle&#x27;s alma mater Wossamotta U. Boris and Natasha launch an elaborate plan to assassinate Bullwinkle, donating a check to the university in his name, inspiring the academic board to award Bullwinkle with an honorary &quot;Mooster&#x27;s Degree&quot;. As Bullwinkle addresses the students, Rocky regains his ability to fly, stopping Boris from killing Bullwinkle with the CDI.
Boris and Natasha chase Rocky and Bullwinkle through Chicago, but inadvertently disintegrate their helicopter in the process. Karen reunites with Rocky and Bullwinkle, but the trio is arrested again by numerous state troopers. They are trialed for numerous misdemeanors in ten states, but the presiding Judge Cameo has the charges dropped upon recognizing Rocky and Bullwinkle, informing the district attorney that celebrities are above the law. The trio buys a rickety biplane and escapes Boris and Natasha once again. The two villains consider retiring, lying to Fearless Leader that they had defeated Rocky and Bullwinkle, confident that they have already won. Meanwhile, the heroes&#x27; plane begins to lose altitude due to the combined weight. Rocky flies Karen to New York to stop the broadcast, but they are captured by Boris and Natasha. Fearless Leader initiates his plan and broadcasts programs to brainwash most of the country.
Bullwinkle crash-lands the plane outside the White House in Washington, D.C., and finds the President to be brainwashed by the RBTV programs, which Bullwinkle is immune due to his natural stupidity. Cappy finds Bullwinkle and scans him into the White House&#x27;s computer system, then e-mails him to the studio just as Fearless Leader addresses the nation, disrupting the broadcast, and a chaotic fight breaks out, leading to the capture of the villains. Karen, Rocky, and Bullwinkle then ask the American public to replant Frostbite Falls, and Bullwinkle accidentally activates the CDI, transforming the villains back to their animated forms and banishing them to the Internet once and for all.
In the aftermath, Rocky and Bullwinkle&#x27;s careers are renewed in RBTV, renamed to &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle Television&quot;, and Karen goes on a date with Ole as Rocky, Bullwinkle, and the Narrator return home to a rejuvenated Frostbite Falls.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film entered development at Universal Pictures in 1992, originally with Danny DeVito and Meryl Streep in mind to play the antagonists Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale however the film was encountered and met with several lawsuits, production difficulties and concerns about whether or not the film would stay true to the original animated television series, the film eventually continued development sometime later on and instead of DeVito and Streep, Jason Alexander and Rene Russo, were selected to play the antagonists instead, the film was produced by Universal in association with Robert De Niro&#x27;s production company TriBeca Productions

In October 1998, it was announced Monica Potter had been cast as the lead. Robert De Niro was also announced to be in negotiations for the role of Fearless Leader, with Des McAnuff set to direct from Kenny Lonergan’s screenplay. In November 1998, Jason Alexander was cast as Boris Badenov. In January 1999, Rene Russo was cast as Natasha Fatale. In February 1999, Potter dropped out from the lead role and was replaced by Piper Perabo.

==Visual effects and animation==
Both visual effects and animation services for the film were provided by Industrial Light and Magic. The animators took inspiration from &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, to help incorporate cartoon characters in a live-action setting. Director Des McAnuff wanted &quot;to maintain the simplicity of the original characters&quot; and he also wanted Rocky and Bullwinkle to move more three-dimensionally, to go with the three-dimensional real-world space they occupy in most of the film. As a result, the animators adapted the characters into the modeling and movements of 3D animation but incorporated cel-shaded techniques to help maintain their cartoony overall rendering in their models.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; opened in 2,460 venues, earning $6,814,270 in its opening weekend and ranking fifth in the North American box office and third among the week&#x27;s new releases. It closed on October 5, 2000 with a domestic total of $26,005,820 and $9,129,000 in other territories for a worldwide gross of $35,134,820.

The failure of the film was attributed to the film not being fresh enough for young audiences or appealing to the nostalgia of Baby boomers.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 42% based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The critical consensus stated, &quot;Though the film stays true to the nature of the original cartoon, the script is disappointing and not funny.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 36 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: &quot;Has the same mixture of dumb puns, corny sight gags and sly, even sophisticated in-jokes. It&#x27;s a lot of fun.&quot;

===Accolades===

== Home media ==
&quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on February 13, 2001, and on Blu-ray on May 15, 2018.

Montreal coach Don Matthews surprised many experts by playing rookie cornerbacks D.J. Johnson and Brandon Williams. Williams got the call in place of an injured Omar Evans, while Johnson started in place of Wayne Shaw, because Matthews felt Johnson was better in man-to-man coverage. Even though the inexperience of his young cornerbacks may have cost him the game, Matthews made no apologies for sticking with Williams and Johnson.

After Edmonton running back Mike Pringle opened the scoring with a four-yard TD run on the opening drive, Edmonton took a commanding 14-0 lead in the second quarter when Ray connected with Tucker on a 41-yard touchdown pass, capping a four-play, 70-yard drive.

Ben Cahoon made a spectacular, one-handed catch in tight coverage to put the Alouettes on Edmonton&#x27;s four-yard line. Montreal called an unusual option play when Anthony Calvillo pitched the ball to running back Deonce Whitaker who tossed a four-yard touchdown to a wide-open Pat Woodcock.

On Edmonton&#x27;s next possession, Pringle fumbled, and Montreal went straight to work, as Calvillo hit Silvain Girard on a 32-yard TD pass to tie the game. After a Keith Stokes fumble later in the quarter, Ray hooked up with a streaking Tucker with 1:23 left in the quarter on a 20-yard TD passing play, restoring the Eskimos&#x27; seven-point advantage.

Montreal struck back on the next drive. Calvillo threw a 27-yard TD to Cahoon with 50 seconds left in the half to tie the score at 21-21, but Edmonton took a 24-21 lead into the intermission when Sean Fleming connected on a 27-yard field goal following another Stokes fumble deep in Montreal&#x27;s half.

The Eskimo defence took over in the second half, holding Montreal to a single point in the third quarter, while Ray scored early in the fourth quarter on a one-yard run to give the Eskimos a 31-22 lead. The turning point in the game came one play earlier when a Montreal fumble recovery was negated by an offside call on D.J. Johnson, sapping the life out of the Alouettes.

Fleming booted a 27-yard field goal with 29 seconds left to seal the victory for Edmonton.

==Trivia==
Montreal Coach Don Matthews had previously won five Grey Cup championships.

Pringle eclipsed the record of 359 career yards rushing in Grey Cup games set by Winnipeg legend Leo Lewis.

Jason Tucker, had two touchdowns and seven receptions for 132 yards, winning game MVP honours in the process. Ben Cahoon made six catches for 148 yards and was voted most outstanding Canadian.

This was Edmonton&#x27;s 12th championship and first since defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 1993 Grey Cup final.

Ricky Ray completed 22 of 32 pass attempts for 301 yards. Anthony Calvillo was 22 for 37 for 371 yards.

Edmonton and Montreal have met in 11 Grey Cup clashes. The Alouettes prevailed in 1974, the Ice Bowl of 1977, and 2002.
The Eskimos have won in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2003 and 2005.

This is the final Grey Cup game to have been played on the first-generation AstroTurf surface.

<doc id="1170666" wikidata="Q245685" url="?curid=1170666" title="Sports (Huey Lewis and the News album)">
<text>Sports is the third album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released on September 15, 1983, by Chrysalis Records. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on June 30, 1984, and ultimately charted for 160 weeks. &quot;Sports&quot; was ranked No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end album chart for 1984 and spawned four top-ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; and &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; earning Grammy Award nominations. &quot;Sports&quot; also did very well internationally, where most of its singles charted in the top 40 in multiple countries. The album has been certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA.

==Composition==
&quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; was developed after the band performed at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio in 1980, which they had been told was a &quot;great rock &amp; roll town&quot;. The following day, Lewis told his bandmates that he felt the heart of rock and roll really was in Cleveland and thought the sentiment would make for a good song, but the band convinced him to slightly alter the lyrics to &quot;the heart of rock &amp; roll is still beating&quot;.

&quot;Bad Is Bad&quot; was penned with Lewis&#x27; original band, Clover. It was written in the late 1970s while Lewis was working with Thin Lizzy, whose frontman Phil Lynott liked the song so much that he would sing a fast paced version at some of his concerts. Another version of &quot;Bad Is Bad&quot; appeared on Dave Edmunds&#x27; album &quot;Repeat When Necessary&quot; (1979), featuring Lewis on harmonica. 

The idea for &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; came to Lewis during a car ride to his lawyer&#x27;s office, and he wrote down the majority of the lyrics upon arriving. After Lewis made an unsuccessful attempt to put the idea to music with bassist Mario Cipollina, guitarist Chris Hayes developed new music for the final song on his own.

&quot;Walking on a Thin Line&quot;, written by Andre Pessis and former Clover member Kevin Wells, was about the poor treatment of veterans who returned home from the Vietnam War. &quot;Finally Found a Home&quot;, inspired by an offhand comment about &quot;ticky-tacky&quot; houses near an airport, later progressed into a song about having a career in the music business. Saxophonist/guitarist Johnny Colla wrote the music for &quot;If This Is It&quot; alone and gave the song to Lewis, who penned the lyrics on a tour bus. &quot;You Crack Me Up&quot;, written by Lewis and Cipollina, was based on various people the band had encountered in the parking lot of Uncle Charlie&#x27;s, a bar the band had frequently performed at before they achieved mainstream success.

&quot;Sports&quot; also contains cover versions of &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, written by the songwriting team of Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, and &quot;Honky Tonk Blues&quot;, written by Hank Williams.

==Production==
&quot;Sports&quot; was self-produced by the band after their manager, Bob Brown, felt the band&#x27;s own demos were better than the producers they had been considering. The ethos behind the production of the album was to meld old techniques and instrumentation with modern technology, inspired by hearing the use of an electronic drum machine on Steely Dan&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;. The juxtaposition of an old style vocal sound with the modern LinnDrum on &quot;Bad Is Bad&quot; provided guidance for the rest of the album&#x27;s production. 

Lewis&#x27;s idea to record &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; with a sequenced bass line and drum machine was initially met with displeasure by both bassist Mario Cipollina and drummer Bill Gibson. The first attempt at this was deemed unsatisfactory and the song was re-recorded with the full band, but after the album was mixed, Lewis decided that both &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; and &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; needed to be re-recorded with sequenced bass and drums, adding a slight tempo increase in the process. The band initially used a kick drum to create the simulated heartbeat sound for &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; but were unhappy with the results, so engineer Jim Gaines and keyboardist Sean Hopper spent six hours developing a new heartbeat sound using various other means. Lewis later referred to the album&#x27;s production style as &quot;cut and paste, put together piece by piece&quot;.

Lewis approached Gaines with the idea to record &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, which they initially thought was an unreleased song. Gaines later recalled that, while the band was working on the song, an engineer mentioned that it had already been covered by both Exile and the BusBoys. Although the band&#x27;s recording was ultimately finished, it was initially shelved. However, Lewis later recalled hearing the BusBoys recording their version in an adjacent studio, and that he&#x27;d decided his version with the News &quot;had merit&quot; and was &quot;maybe a little better&quot;. It eventually became the album&#x27;s first single. &quot;Honky Tonk Blues&quot; was an attempt to cover the Hank Williams song in the style of Status Quo, and Lewis later stated that Hank Williams Jr. complimented the News on their rendition.

Brown became concerned about &quot;Sports&quot; being promoted properly when the band&#x27;s label, Chrysalis Records, fired much of its production staff. As a result, the band made a decision to withhold the finished record from the label until the issues were resolved.

==Packaging==
The title of the album was a play on the band&#x27;s name. The cover art features a photo of the band at the 2 AM Club, a bar located in Mill Valley, California, where the band had performed during its early days. A bar was chosen for the shoot because the band reasoned that most people watched televised sporting events in bars.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Sports&quot; was released on September 15, 1983. The lead single, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. The album&#x27;s second release, &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;, turned out to be the band&#x27;s second best-selling single, peaking at number 6 on the Hot 100 and eventually being certified gold in 1989, with sales of 1 million copies (although this would be considered platinum by modern single certification standards). The third single from the album, &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, continued the band&#x27;s success, peaking at number 6 on the Hot 100. 

In June 1984, &quot;Sports&quot; hit number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and would ultimately spend 160 weeks on the charts. The fourth single from the album, &quot;If This Is It&quot;, was released shortly thereafter, peaking at number 6 on the Hot 100. The fifth and final single from the album, &quot;Walking on a Thin Line&quot;, was released in October 1984 and peaked at number 18.

&quot;Sports&quot; was the second biggest selling album on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s 1984 end-of-year sales chart, after Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal by a Group at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards in 1984, while &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; was nominated for Record of the Year at the 27th Annual Grammys in 1985. &quot;Sports&quot; charted in the top 40 in many countries outside the United States, including Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. On July 20, 1987, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album 7× Platinum for sales exceeding 7 million units.

Music videos were created for the singles &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;, &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;If This Is It&quot; and &quot;Walking on a Thin Line&quot;. The band later filmed a music video for &quot;Bad Is Bad&quot; on the streets of San Francisco in March 1985, although the song was not released as a single.

&quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; became the focus of a lawsuit against artist Ray Parker Jr., who was accused of plagiarizing the song for his 1984 hit, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, although Parker later countersued Lewis for breach of a confidentiality agreement, after Lewis discussed the lawsuit on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; in 2001.

==Legacy==
The album is critiqued by the character Patrick Bateman in both the book (1991) and film (2000) versions of &quot;American Psycho&quot; by Bret Easton Ellis. According to Bateman, &quot;Sports&quot; marks the point in the band&#x27;s career in which they &quot;really came into their own, commercially and artistically.&quot; In 2013, Lewis, along with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, parodied this scene in a video for &quot;Funny or Die&quot;, wherein Lewis mirrors Bateman&#x27;s character and chats with Yankovic about &quot;American Psycho&quot;.

On May 10, 2013, Huey Lewis and the News embarked upon a Sports 30th Anniversary Tour, in which they performed the album in its entirety, as well as other songs. On May 14, a two-disc &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; of &quot;Sports&quot; was released, featuring the remastered album in addition to archival live versions of every song on the album.

<doc id="1170668" wikidata="Q489547" url="?curid=1170668" title="Itavia">
<text>Itavia was an Italian airline founded in 1958 and based at Rome Fiumicino Airport. During the 1960s it became one of the main private airlines of Italy, until its collapse in the early 1980s, following the destruction of Flight 870, also known as the Ustica disaster. Itavia was headquartered in Rome.

==History==
The airline was formed under the name of Società di Navigazione Aerea Itavia in 1958 and started domestic services a year later using de Havilland Dove and de Havilland DH.114 Heron aircraft. Operations were suspended in 1961, but resumed in 1962 under the name Aerolinee Itavia. The Herons were replaced in 1963 with the larger Handley Page Dart Herald, a pressurised turboprop liner. The Heralds remained in service until 1973.

Operations ceased again in 1965 and recommenced again in 1969 using Fokker F28 twin-jet airliners. In 1971 the Douglas DC-9-15 entered service. Other DC-9 versions operated were the Douglas DC-9-21, Douglas DC-9-31, Douglas DC-9-33 and Douglas DC-9-51. A total of 14 F28s and 11 DC-9s were used throughout its history.

Itavia operated a domestic network, augmented by charter flights and some European routes during the holiday season. In 1972 the company registered its head office in Catanzaro, primarily to benefit from subsidies and tax relief designed to assist businesses in the south of the country, but its administrative base and management team remained in Via Sicilia in Rome. Activity was again suspended in December 1980, following the crash of Flight 870 earlier that year and the deaths of all 81 people on board. The airline was replaced by Aermediterranea, a subsidiary of Alitalia and ATI, in 1981.

==Fleet==


Various aircraft types were operated by Itavia over the years:

==Incidents and accidents==
*On October 14, 1960, a De Havilland 114 Heron 2, registered as I-AOMU departed from Rome to Genoa, and crashed on mountain (Monte Capanne), in the Elba&#x27;s Isle. All 11 passengers and crew on board died.
*On March 30, 1963, a DC-3, registered as I-TAVI departed from Pescara to Rome, and crashed on Monte Serra Alta, a mountain in nearby Sora. All 8 passengers and crew on board died.
*On January 1, 1974, a Fokker F28, registered as I-TIDE departed from Bologna to Turin, and crashed on approach to Turin Airport. 38 of the 42 people on board died.
*On June 27, 1980, Itavia Flight 870, a Douglas DC-9-15 flying from Bologna to Palermo crashed in the Tyrrhenian Sea for reasons unclear, killing all 81 people on board. An explosion caused by either a bomb on board or an air-to-air missile is considered the most likely explanation.

<text>Ontario Motor Speedway was a motorsport venue located in Ontario, California. It was the first and only automobile racing facility built to accommodate major races sanctioned by all of the four dominant racing sanctioning bodies: USAC (and now IndyCar Series) for open-wheel oval car races; NASCAR for a oval stock car races; NHRA for drag races; and FIA for Formula One road course races. Additionally, several motorcycle races were held at the track. Constructed in less than two years, the track opened in August 1970 and was considered state of the art at the time.

The first full year of racing included the Indy-style open wheel inaugural California 500 on September 6, 1970; the Miller High Life 500 stock car race on February 28, 1971, the NHRA Super Nationals drag race on November 21, 1970 and the Questor Grand Prix on March 28, 1971. Each of these inaugural races drew attendance second only to their established counterparts, the USAC Indianapolis 500, the NASCAR Daytona 500, the NHRA U.S. Nationals, and the U.S. Formula One race at Watkins Glen.

The track was purchased for real estate development by Chevron Land Company in late 1980 and demolished at a cost of $3 million in 1981. It is estimated that the facility, with 155,000 permanent seats and an air-conditioned private stadium club would have a replacement cost in 2009 of over $350 million.

==History==

In the mid-sixties, there were two prior attempts to build &quot;The Indianapolis of the West&quot;. The first attempt was led by National General Corporation, and the second by the Santa Anita Consolidated and Filmways Corporations. The second attempt focused on an 800-acre parcel of land (the Cucamonga Winery) directly across from the new Ontario International Airport on the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10), east of downtown Los Angeles.

William Loorz CEO of Stolte Construction Co., one of California&#x27;s largest commercial construction companies, who had been designated the contractor on the project, sent information on the failed projects to David Lockton, co-founder with Chuck Barnes of Sports Headliners, a leading sports management firm in Indianapolis, Indiana, that acted as agent and manager for most of the Formula One and Indianapolis-style racing drivers.

Sports Headliners represented most of the leading Formula One drivers and the winners of the past 10 Indianapolis races. Lockton was convinced that the prior efforts failed for lack of involvement with anyone familiar with the automobile racing community. He flew to Los Angeles in October 1966, met with Stolte and viewed the proposed site which had by then been subdivided into fourteen separate parcels owned by 150 individual owners, many of them Hollywood celebrities who had bought the land for tax shelters.

Lockton spent the next nine months acquiring options on all of the fourteen parcels and then leveraged his position as the drivers’ representative on the board of USAC (United States Auto Club) the sanctioning body for the Indianapolis 500 race; and his personal friendship with Tony Hulman, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to obtain not only the promise of a USAC sanctioned race, but also the commitment and involvement of Indianapolis Motor Speedway personnel. He obtained the first and only IRS ruling to allow tax deductibility of the $25.5 million industrial revenue bond offering secured by the real estate, in which the facility would be run by a for-profit operating company.

Lockton convinced leading bond investment banker John Nuveen &amp; Co. in Chicago as well as Citi Securities Corporation in Indianapolis to underwrite the bond offering. He also raised $5 million in equity from Pioneer Lands Corp.; Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette; and Stolte Construction Company; with Lockton and these three entities owning the speedway in more or less equal proportions. Renowned California architect Robert W. Kite AIA whose firm, Kite &amp; Overpeck Architects, Beverly Hills, was retained by Stolte to design the state-of-the-art facility. The track layout was devised by Dutch circuit designer John Hugenholtz (Managing Director of the Zandvoort Formula 1 circuit), who also designed Suzuka in Japan, Zolder, Jarama, Nivelles, Hockenheim and other circuits. Robert (Bob) Kite traveled extensively throughout the United States and Europe to research the design of the facility. Track management planned to make OMS as a replica of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with many important enhancements. The racing surface was one lane wider and, unlike the Indy speedway, the short chutes (the two shorter straight-aways, at either end of the track) were banked, which made the OMS slightly faster. Drag racing would take place on pit road, which was longer and wider than the one at Indianapolis.

In addition, the OMS was built with an infield road course, making it a facility for both oval and road course style racing in addition to drag racing. At the time, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, familiarly known as &quot;the Brickyard&quot; did not have an infield road course and one was not built there until 2000. The Indianapolis track, which was first built in 1909, was originally paved at great expense with 3.2 million paving bricks. Today, 3 feet (0.91 m) of original bricks remain at the start-finish line, still giving meaning to &quot;the Brickyard&quot;. To symbolize Hulman&#x27;s gesture of friendship with Lockton and support for the &quot;Indy of the West&quot;, he provided a special gift from Indy: a circle of the original bricks from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway were laid in the OMS&#x27;s victory lane.

The Ontario Motor Speedway introduced many innovations to the sport of automobile racing and is attributed as being the facility that started the boom in development of similar super speedways which made automobile racing track ownership one of the highest growth segments from 1980 to 2005. Ontario pioneered a private stadium club with annual memberships, corporate suites, crash absorbent retaining walls and safety fences, the first pro-am celebrity race, state-of-the-art modern garage facilities for the race teams, and a computerized real-time timing and scoring system which showed in real-time the positions on the track to spectators during the race. This timing and scoring system was subsequently adopted by the Formula One circuit and ultimately by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The OMS was designed by the renowned architectural firm Kite &amp; Overpeck Architects, Beverly Hills, known for important LA landmarks such as the 9000 Sunset Building and the Beverly Hillcrest Hotel. The principal in charge of the OMS was Robert W. Kite AIA. The K&amp;O project team included Ted Tyler. During the 22-month construction period, speedway management negotiated the required race dates from the rival sanctioning bodies, convincing the FIA (Federation Internationale de L’Automobile) to allow a second U.S. Grand Prix in 1972, contingent upon conducting a qualifying race (the Questor Grand Prix) in 1971.

The OMS was the first automobile race facility to launch a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign based on extensive market research. The research indicated that in order to attract more than the approximately 50,000 hardcore racing fans in Southern California it would be necessary to convince the non-racing fan of the new speedway&#x27;s safety to overcome their fears of seeing a terrible accident; to position the facility as a clean, safe, fun place to take the family, and a place to rub elbows with Hollywood stars, astronauts and other celebrities. The speedway launched a radio, billboard and newspaper advertising campaign, developed by the Los Angeles-based Campbell Ewald Agency, in December 1969, promoting the California 500 as &quot;the place for the family to be for their Labor Day weekend&quot; nine months later.

Legendary Hollywood PR agent, Warren Cowan of the Rogers &amp; Cowan public relations agency heavily promoted the Hollywood community and the astronauts’ interest in the sport and involvement with the track. During races the suites were full of celebrities, including Paul Newman, Kirk Douglas, Dick Smothers, John Wayne, James Garner and Ina Balin, as well as many astronauts, including Pete Conrad. The dedication of the track occurred in August 1970 with the staging of the first celebrity pro-am race, featuring many stars from the entertainment industry paired with professional, race winning drivers. The celebrity pro-am race was subsequently aired as a TV special on NBC.

The speedway&#x27;s board of directors when the track opened consisted of chairman Dan Lufkin, of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette; CEO David Lockton; Donald Riehl, of DLJ; William Loorz, CEO of Stolte Construction; Paul Newman, Kirk Douglas, and Dick Smothers from the entertainment industry; J.C. Agajanian, an American motor sport promoter and race car owner; Parnelli Jones, 1963 winner of the Indianapolis 500; Roger Penske, retired race car driver, race car owner and auto related business entrepreneur; Briggs Cunningham, an American sportsman who raced cars and yachts; and Chuck Barnes, chairman and CEO of Sports Headliners, and former director of public relations for Firestone Tires.

The advertising campaign was so successful that all reserved seats were completely sold out over six weeks before the inaugural California 500. The 178,000 in paid attendance and $3.3 million gross remained the largest crowd and highest gross in inflation adjusted dollars of any single day sporting event other than the Indianapolis 500 for nearly three decades. California governor Ronald Reagan presented the trophy to race winner Jim McElreath, a teammate of car owner A. J. Foyt. President Richard M. Nixon was represented at the event by his daughter Tricia Nixon, and her husband, Ed Cox.

The second event, the Mattel Hot Wheels Super Nationals Drag Race on November 20, drew a crowd second only to the NHRA Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana and the Ontario drag strip proved to be the fastest ever with many world records set. The NASCAR sanctioned Miller High Life stock car race on February 28, 1971, drew a crowd of 80,000 and was the third largest crowd to see the first low bank 2-1/2 mile oval stock car race, and the third largest attendance for a stock car race behind the Daytona 500 and the Talladega 500. The Questor Grand Prix, won by Mario Andretti on March 28, 1971, was a head-to-head battle between European drivers using Formula One cars against the U.S. Formula 5000 series. This format was a precondition to receipt of a second FIA sanctioned U.S. Grand Prix. The crowd of only 55,000, while the largest to attend a road race in California, was a disappointment; even so, the speedway&#x27;s schedule of upcoming events printed on page 130 of the 1971 California 500 official program listed a &quot;Second Annual Questor Grand Prix&quot; taking place on April 9 as &quot;One of two full-points World Championship Formula 1 races scheduled for the U.S. next year.&quot;

From a racing standpoint, the inaugural season was a tremendous success and from an attendance standpoint only the hybrid Questor Grand Prix was a disappointment. In April, 1971, Lockton resigned as CEO from Ontario (as well as from Sports Headliners) to pursue non-automobile racing related interests and was replaced as CEO by Ray Smartis, the vice president and general manager. Despite the speedway&#x27;s commercial success in building attendance for each event and the clear potential for future profitability, in the short term, the operating company had difficulty meeting its debt service obligations on the municipal bonds, primarily due to the shortfall of the hybrid Questor Grand Prix race and a downturn in California 500 attendance in year two.

The advertising campaign for the Inaugural California 500 had guaranteed seat purchasers seat renewal rights in perpetuity if they paid for them within 30 days of the last race. Over 20% of the seats for the second 1972 Cal 500 event were sold on this promotion, providing the OMS with almost $800,000 in advance ticket sales. Rather than a sustained campaign, the advertising or promotional money was not spent on the 1972 race until only a few weeks before the event and attendance was marginally down approximately 30,000 in the second year.

In 1973 the operating company was sold and in a desperate attempt to make the debt service payments the new operators devised a strategy to stage two California 500 races in one fiscal year. For the third California 500, the established and popular Labor Day date was sacrificed for a March 10 date, despite the evidence from extensive original market, traffic and weather research that Labor Day weekend was by a considerable margin the date with the largest potential attendance. The March crowds never approached the attendance of the Labor Day event and the new operator ultimately defaulted on the debt service.

Ontario was used in a number of TV shows and movies, including &quot;Salvage One&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; and was also mentioned in &quot;CHiPs&quot;.

==Other events==
Attempts were made to provide revenue by holding other events and concerts to promote the track venue more.

On February 28, 1971, OMS promoted and staged motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel&#x27;s record jump over 19 cars, drawing a crowd of 50,000 in paid attendance on the day prior to the NASCAR sanctioned Miller High Life 500 mile stock car race. The jump was filmed as the climactic scene in the movie &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;, starring George Hamilton, which was filmed in and around the race track during that weekend.
California Jam was held on April 6, 1974. This rock festival concert drew a crowd of 300,000–400,000, the largest paid attendance for a rock concert. Portions of the concert were televised live on ABC. The performers included (in order of appearance) Rare Earth, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Eagles, Seals and Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.

California Jam II was held on March 18, 1978. The second event drew a crowd of almost 300,000 paid attendance. Performers included Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, Santana, Dave Mason, Foreigner, Heart, Bob Welch, Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood, Mahogany Rush and Rubicon.

By 1980, the Ontario Motor Speedway bonds were selling at approximately $0.30 on the dollar. Generally unknown and unrealized by the bond-holding public, the of land originally purchased at an average price of $7,500 per acre, had now risen to a value of $150,000 per acre. Chevron Land Company, a division of Chevron Corporation recognized the opportunity to acquire the bonds and effectively foreclosed on the real estate. For approximately $10 million, Chevron acquired land which had a commercial real estate development value of $120 million, without regard to the historic significance or future potential of the speedway.

==Subsequent development==
Many of the grandstands and other infrastructure were sold off to other venues. Section 10 and Section 20 (the grandstands on the east side of the arena) at the Paso Robles Event Center, also known as The California Midstate Fair), in Paso Robles were constructed from grandstands removed from the speedway. Several ticket booths were relocated from the speedway to the fair grounds.

The property remained vacant for several years until the mid-1980s when a Hilton hotel was built on turn 4 of the old speedway site. It was the first multiple-story building of its kind in the City of Ontario.

By the mid-2000s, development on the property had increased. In 2007, much of the remainder of the property became a mixed-use development with condominiums, business offices, and some retail stores. In the fall of 2008, the Citizens Business Bank Arena (now Toyota Arena), an 11,000-seat sports and entertainment venue was opened. The arena is home to the AHL Ontario Reign and is built in the infield area of the old Ontario track.

The Ontario Mills shopping mall is located to the east, across the street from the former site of the Speedway. A minor tribute to the racing heritage of the property can be seen in the nearby street names (ex: Duesenberg Drive, Ferrari Lane, and others), in much the same way that the developed area that was formerly Riverside International Raceway reflects the same heritage, with roads named after famous drivers. On the west side of the former raceway is a park dedicated to OMS. Today, nothing remains of OMS since the last remains of it (where turn 3 was once located at the corner of N. Haven St. and 4th Streer.) has now been turned into a parking lot for Stater Brothers and smaller retail stores.

==Subsequent racing events==
After the failure of the California 500, the IndyCar series replaced the race with the Michigan 500 at Michigan International Speedway. Eight years later in 1988, Riverside International Raceway (in nearby Riverside) was also sold and demolished in favor of development.

In 1997, the Auto Club Speedway opened in Fontana, less than from the former site of the OMS, and the two names were sometimes confused. (The California track was called the &quot;California Speedway&quot; before a naming rights deal was signed in February 2008.)

From 1977 to 1980, a second Champ Car event was run at Ontario, sharing the bill with a stock car race. It was first joined by USAC Stock Car, and in 1980, when the race joined the CART calendar, by the NASCAR Winston West Series.
===Questor Grand Prix===
The race, held on 28 March 1971, was open to Formula One and Formula A cars.

==Lap records==
The fastest ever qualifying lap on the 2.5-mile Oval is 0:44.325 seconds, set by Rick Mears in a Penske PC-7, during qualifying for the 1979 California 500. The fastest lap on the original 3.194-mile Road Course is 1:41.257, set by Jackie Stewart in a Tyrrell 001, during qualifying for the 1971 Questor Grand Prix. The official race lap records at Ontario Motor Speedway are listed as:

<doc id="1170674" wikidata="Q521095" url="?curid=1170674" title="Robert Morgenthau">
<text>Robert Morris Morgenthau ( ; July 31, 1919July 21, 2019) was an American lawyer. From 1975 until his retirement in 2009, he was the District Attorney for New York County (the borough of Manhattan), having previously served as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York throughout much of the 1960s on the appointment of John F. Kennedy. At retirement, Morgenthau was the longest-serving district attorney in the history of the State of New York.

==Early life==
Morgenthau was born in 1919 in New York City into a prominent Ashkenazi Jewish family that had emigrated from Baden in 1866. He was the son of Elinor (née Fatman) and Henry Morgenthau Jr., who served as the Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman from 1934 until 1945. His maternal great-grandfather was Mayer Lehman, a co-founder of Lehman Brothers. His grandfather, Henry Morgenthau Sr., was United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Before going into diplomatic service, Henry Morgenthau Sr. had made a fortune in real estate, and became a strong financial backer of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. 
Morgenthau&#x27;s paternal grandmother was born in Montgomery, Alabama.

From the earliest days, the Morgenthau family was well-connected politically. The family home was near Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s Springwood Estate at Hyde Park, New York, and he grew up acquainted with the future President.

==World War II Navy Combat Service==

Morgenthau graduated from the New Lincoln School, Deerfield Academy, and Amherst College. In June 1940, while still in college, he enlisted in the United States Navy V-7 officers&#x27; training program that was open to students with three years of college, enabling them to earn commissions in the Naval Reserve. He took his 30-day midshipman cruise in July 1940, and spent his 21st birthday on the battleship USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After graduating from college, he completed three months of midshipman training on board the USS &quot;Prairie State&quot;. He attained the rank of lieutenant commander, and served as the executive officer of both the USS &quot;Lansdale&quot; and the USS &quot;Harry F. Bauer&quot;. Naval records indicate heroic action during the Battle of Iwo Jima — the &quot;Bauer&quot; was attacked by thirteen kamikazes, and survived a torpedo and dive bomber attack (both failed to detonate). He saw action in both the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters, mostly aboard destroyers, for which he was awarded both the Bronze and Gold stars.

After the war, Morgenthau studied law, graduating from Yale Law School in 1948. He joined the New York law firm of Patterson, Belknap &amp; Webb, becoming a partner in 1954.

==Career==

===U.S. Attorney===
In 1961, after twelve years of practicing corporate law, Morgenthau accepted an appointment from President John F. Kennedy as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In 1962, he was the Democratic nominee for Governor of New York, and resigned his federal office. After his defeat by the incumbent Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Morgenthau was reappointed U.S. Attorney and served in that position for the remainder of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Morgenthau was eating lunch with Robert Kennedy when Kennedy received the news of his brother&#x27;s murder in Dallas.

In January 1969, following the election of President Richard Nixon, Morgenthau remained in office, and for months resisted increasingly public pressures from the Nixon Administration to resign. He retained support from New York&#x27;s liberal Republican U.S. Senators Jacob K. Javits and Charles Goodell. Morgenthau and his supporters claimed that replacing him would disrupt his work on vital cases, and that Nixon might be seeking to prevent Morgenthau from pursuing investigations that would prove embarrassing to the President or his friends. Nonetheless, Morgenthau&#x27;s position became increasingly untenable. While well-regarded, he was after all a Democrat, thought to harbor political aspirations. Morgenthau&#x27;s insistence on remaining in office seemed increasingly unreasonable. He was eventually forced out of office at the end of 1969. Republican Whitney North Seymour Jr. was appointed as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

===Return to politics===
Afterward, Morgenthau served briefly in the reformist administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay as a deputy mayor, before resigning to seek the Democratic nomination for governor in 1970. Morgenthau was less successful in raising funds and developing support than were two other candidates, Arthur Goldberg and Howard Samuels, and within weeks, he withdrew from the race. Goldberg won the nomination, and was subsequently defeated by Rockefeller.

===District Attorney of New York County===
Morgenthau remained in private life until 1974, when he was elected to the office of District Attorney of New York County. This was a special election caused by the death of Frank Hogan, who had served as DA for more than 30 years. Morgenthau defeated Hogan&#x27;s interim successor, Richard Kuh. He was elected to a full term in 1977, and was re-elected seven times. He was not opposed in a general election from 1985 to 2005.

Morgenthau was criticized in the press for his conduct in the wake of a major police corruption scandal. Eight men who were falsely arrested by New York City Transit Police officers in the scandal that shook the department were awarded more than $1 million in damages by a federal judge. One plaintiff, Ronald Yeadon, was a police officer. He was arrested twice while off duty and accused of sexually abusing a woman.

Morgenthau retained a national profile while serving in what was technically a local office, in part because of his dogged pursuit of white-collar crime. According to Gary Naftalis, a prominent Manhattan defense attorney who had been an assistant to Morgenthau in the 1960s, Morgenthau believed that prosecuting &quot;crime in the suites&quot; was every bit as important as prosecuting &quot;crime in the streets&quot;.

At age 85 in 2005, Morgenthau announced that he would run for a ninth (eighth full) term as district attorney. For the first time in decades, he encountered a vigorous primary opponent – former state court judge Leslie Crocker Snyder.
Snyder won the endorsement of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which, like virtually all of the city&#x27;s establishment, had long supported Morgenthau.

Morgenthau won the Democratic primary with 59% of the vote, to Snyder&#x27;s 41%. In the general election, he was once again the candidate for all political parties in the election, having been nominated by the Democrats, Republicans, and the Working Families Party. Morgenthau won re-election with more than 99% of the vote.

===Retirement===

On February 27, 2009, Morgenthau announced that he would not seek re-election in 2009, saying: &quot;I never expected to be here this long ... [R]ecently, I figured that I&#x27;d served 25 years beyond the normal retirement age.&quot; He was succeeded in office by Cyrus Vance Jr., a prosecutor under Morgenthau and the son of former President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s secretary of state Cyrus Vance. Morgenthau officially endorsed Vance on June 25. Vance went on to win the primary election on September 15, 2009 and the subsequent general election on November 3. On January 20, 2010, Morgenthau joined the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.

===Selected cases===
Cases which Morgenthau&#x27;s office prosecuted include:
*Mark David Chapman (1981): Chapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the killing of John Lennon and was sentenced to 20-years-to-life in prison. He has been denied parole multiple times and will likely never get out of jail.
*Robert Chambers, the &quot;Preppie Killer&quot; (1988): Chambers pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the killing of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin while the jury had the case and served 15 years in prison.
*Central Park Jogger case (1989): Five teenaged suspects were wrongly convicted of assaulting and raping 28-year-old Trisha Meili in a &quot;wilding&quot; incident in the north section of Central Park. After Morgenthau&#x27;s office investigated the confession in 2002 by another man, including finding that his DNA matched evidence at the scene, he recommended vacating the convictions of the five men and dismissal of charges, which the court accomplished.
*Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz (2005): The top two executives of Tyco were found guilty of stealing more than $150 million from the company they had been entrusted to manage.
*Tupac Shakur (1994), he was convicted in New York City of three charges of sexual molestation, and served nine months in prison.

*Eliot Spitzer (1986–1992): Former Governor and Attorney General of New York State

*Lanny A. Breuer (1985–1989): Former head of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice
*John F. Kennedy Jr. (1989–1993): Son of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, journalist, lawyer, and socialite

==Television characters==
The character of District Attorney Adam Schiff (played by actor Steven Hill), the New York district attorney in the long-running TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; from 1990 through 2000, was loosely based on Morgenthau. Morgenthau reportedly was a fan of the character.

From 2021 through 2023, a fortysomething Robert Morgenthau was portrayed by actor Justin Bartha in seven episodes of the Epix series that takes place in the mid-1960s, &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot;.

==Affiliations==
Morgenthau&#x27;s other principal civic activities were the Police Athletic League of New York City, which he served since 1962, first as president and then chairman, and the Museum of Jewish Heritage, of which he was chairman.

==Awards==
In 2005, Morgenthau received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York&quot;. Morgenthau also received the Association Medal of the New York City Bar Association for exceptional contributions to the honor and standing of the bar in the city of New York.

In 2016 he received the Leo Baeck Medal.

==Personal life==
His first wife was Martha Pattridge, a Christian, whom he met in college; they had five children: Joan Morgenthau Wadsworth, Anne Pattridge Morgenthau Grand, Robert Pattridge Morgenthau, Elinor Gates Morgenthau, and Barbara Elizabeth Morgenthau Lee. 
Elinor, known as &quot;Nellie,&quot; suffered from a severe mental disability. She &quot;did not speak ... was violent&quot; and never really recognized her own parents. When Nellie was five years old, Morgenthau very reluctantly agreed to place her in an upstate New York treatment facility. As of 2023, at age 72, Nellie Morgenthau remains in a similar private facility, never having recognized her visiting father.
The Morgenthaus raised their children in the Jewish faith. Martha died in 1972. Morgenthau was devastated by her death, and for a while afterward, he refused to talk about her in order to avoid memories of her death.

In 1977, he married Lucinda Franks, an author who in 1971 won a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting. She was also Christian. They had two children: Joshua Franks Morgenthau (born 1984), and Amy Elinor Morgenthau (born 1990). They lived in New York City. They remained married until his death and Franks survived him until she died on May 5, 2021. His son Joshua runs the family farm, Fishkill Farms, founded by Henry Morgenthau Jr.

===Death===
Morgenthau died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on July 21, 2019, after a short illness. He was ten days shy of his 100th birthday, and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, New York.
