<text>Giselle Fernández (born May 15, 1961) is an American television journalist and anchor for Spectrum News 1. Her appearances on network television include reporting and guest anchoring for &quot;CBS Early Show&quot;, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, regular host for &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, and contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Fernández was born in Mexico City and was brought to East Los Angeles in the United States at the age of four. Her Catholic father was a flamenco dancer, while her Jewish mother was a student of Mexican folklore. She attended California State University, Sacramento, where she graduated in 1982 earning her B.A. in Journalism and Government.

==Career==
Her television career began in 1983 with brief stops at KRDO-TV in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and then KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara, California. In 1985 she joined KTLA in Los Angeles as a reporter and weekend anchor. She was recommended to KTLA by actor Fess Parker, who lived in the Santa Barbara area and was a friend of KTLA&#x27;s news managing director at the time. Two years later Fernandez moved to CBS-owned WBBM-TV in Chicago, and in 1989 to WCIX CBS&#x27;s newly owned station in Miami. In 1988 she garnered some controversy in Chicago when she went boating with John Cappas, a drug dealer being sought by authorities, then accompanied him to his arrest by federal agents.

She gained her first national news job in October 1991 for CBS News, when she moved to New York City and became a correspondent and back-up anchor for the morning, evening, and weekend news broadcasts. She later moved to NBC, where she anchored &quot;Weekend Today&quot; and the Sunday edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and filled in for Brian Williams on the Saturday edition, and undertook various special reporting assignments in the U.S. and elsewhere. During this period of national news coverage, Fernández reported on the crisis from Cuban immigration, unrest in Haiti, the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, the trial of the conspirators from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and a scud missile attack while covering the Persian Gulf War. She was invited to make a rare interview of Fidel Castro, then president of Cuba.

From 1996 to 1999, Fernández was the co-host for &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, an entertainment news program on NBC. She then co-hosted the &quot;This Week in History&quot; show on the History Channel. In October 2001, she returned to Los Angeles and rejoined KTLA. She left this position in August 2003 to pursue a variety of special projects, including making a movie and writing children&#x27;s books. In 2004, her book titled &quot;Gigi and the Birthday Ring&quot; was published through the Laredo Publishing Company.

She is president of Skinny Hippo Productions, her own production company, and is co-president of F Squared Productions, where she is a developer of film and television projects. Giselle now works for Charter Communications&#x27; Spectrum News 1 Southern California.

Fernandez anchored &quot;Your Morning on Spectrum News 1&quot; for six years since the launch of the channel in 2018. In August of 2024, Fernandez moved to the afternoon slot with a new three hour program called &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. She continues to host the Emmy-award winning weekly series &quot;LA Stories&quot;.

==Awards==
Fernández has won five Emmy Awards for journalism. The Los Angeles Press Club gave Fernandez The President&#x27;s Award for Impact on Media in 2023. She is a member of the Smithsonian National Board for Latino Initiatives and has worked on the board of trustees of the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles. In 2006, she was named the year&#x27;s Outstanding Philanthropist by the Association of Fundraising Professionals.

==Personal life==
While in Chicago, she met Ron Kershaw, who was previously involved with Jessica Savitch. The two were engaged, but Kershaw died of pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. A month later her father died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In 2002, she married British executive John Farrand, former CEO of Panavision, Inc.; they had a daughter, Talei. The couple separated in April 2014. Fernández participated as a contestant on the second season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in January 2006, but was the third contestant to be eliminated. She partnered with Jonathan Roberts and had an average of 23 points.

<text>The Knight shift is a shift in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency of a paramagnetic 
substance first published in 1949 by the UC Berkeley physicist Walter D. Knight.

For an ensemble of &quot;N&quot; spins in a magnetic induction field formula_1, the nuclear Hamiltonian for the Knight shift is expressed in Cartesian form by:

formula_2, where for the &quot;i&quot;th spin formula_3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, formula_4 is a vector of the Cartesian nuclear angular momentum operators, the 
formula_5 matrix is a second-rank tensor similar to the chemical shift shielding tensor.

The Knight shift refers to the relative shift &quot;K&quot; in NMR frequency for atoms in a metal (e.g. sodium) compared with the same atoms in a nonmetallic environment (e.g. sodium chloride). The observed shift reflects the local magnetic field produced at the sodium nucleus by the magnetization of the conduction electrons. The average local field in sodium augments the applied resonance field by approximately one part per 1000. In nonmetallic sodium chloride the local field is negligible in comparison.

The Knight shift is due to the conduction electrons in metals. They introduce an &quot;extra&quot; effective field at the nuclear site, due to the spin orientations of the conduction electrons in the presence of an external field. This is responsible for the shift observed in the nuclear magnetic resonance. The shift comes from two sources, one is the Pauli paramagnetic spin susceptibility, the other is the s-component wavefunctions at the nucleus.

Depending on the electronic structure, the Knight shift may be temperature dependent. However, in metals which normally have a broad featureless electronic density of states, Knight shifts are temperature independent.

<text>Computational science, also known as scientific computing, technical computing or scientific computation (SC), is a division of science, and more specifically the Computer Sciences, which uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex physical problems. While this typically extends into visual computation, this field of study typically includes: 
* Algorithms (numerical and non-numerical): mathematical models, computational models, and computer simulations developed to solve sciences (e.g, physical, biological, and social), engineering, and humanities problems
* Computer hardware that develops and optimizes the advanced system hardware, firmware, networking, and data management components needed to solve computationally demanding problems
* The computing infrastructure that supports both the science and engineering problem solving and the developmental computer and information science
In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiments, which are the traditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers. Scientists and engineers develop computer programs and application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters. The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms and computational mathematics. In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually floating-point) and are often executed on supercomputers or distributed computing platforms.

== The computational scientist ==

The term computational scientist is used to describe someone skilled in scientific computing. Such a person is usually a scientist, an engineer, or an applied mathematician who applies high-performance computing in different ways to advance the state-of-the-art in their respective applied disciplines in physics, chemistry, or engineering.

Computational science is now commonly considered a third mode of science , complementing and adding to experimentation/observation and theory (see image). Here, one defines a system as a potential source of data, an experiment as a process of extracting data from a system by exerting it through its inputs and a model (&quot;M&quot;) for a system (&quot;S&quot;) and an experiment (&quot;E&quot;) as anything to which &quot;E&quot; can be applied in order to answer questions about &quot;S&quot;. A computational scientist should be capable of:
* recognizing complex problems
* adequately conceptualizing the system containing these problems
* designing a framework of algorithms suitable for studying this system: the simulation
* choosing a suitable computing infrastructure (parallel computing/grid computing/supercomputers)
* hereby, maximizing the computational power of the simulation
* assessing to what level the output of the simulation resembles the systems: the model is validated
* adjusting the conceptualization of the system accordingly
* repeat the cycle until a suitable level of validation is obtained: the computational scientist trusts that the simulation generates adequately realistic results for the system under the studied conditions
Substantial effort in computational sciences has been devoted to developing algorithms, efficient implementation in programming languages, and validating computational results. A collection of problems and solutions in computational science can be found in Steeb, Hardy, Hardy, and Stoop (2004).

Philosophers of science addressed the question to what degree computational science qualifies as science, among them Humphreys and Gelfert. They address the general question of epistemology: how does gain insight from such computational science approaches? Tolk uses these insights to show the epistemological constraints of computer-based simulation research. As computational science uses mathematical models representing the underlying theory in executable form, in essence, they apply modeling (theory building) and simulation (implementation and execution). While simulation and computational science are our most sophisticated way to express our knowledge and understanding, they also come with all constraints and limits already known for computational solutions.

== Applications of computational science ==
Problem domains for computational science/scientific computing include:

=== Predictive computational science ===
Predictive computational science is a scientific discipline concerned with the formulation, calibration, numerical solution, and validation of mathematical models designed to predict specific aspects of physical events, given initial and boundary conditions, and a set of characterizing parameters and associated uncertainties. In typical cases, the predictive statement is formulated in terms of probabilities. For example, given a mechanical component and a periodic loading condition, &quot;the probability is (say) 90% that the number of cycles at failure (Nf) will be in the interval N1&lt;Nf&lt;N2&quot;.

=== Urban complex systems ===
Cities are massively complex systems created by humans, made up of humans, and governed by humans. Trying to predict, understand and somehow shape the development of cities in the future requires complex thinking and computational models and simulations to help mitigate challenges and possible disasters. The focus of research in urban complex systems is, through modeling and simulation, to build a greater understanding of city dynamics and help prepare for the coming urbanization.

=== Computational finance ===

In financial markets, huge volumes of interdependent assets are traded by a large number of interacting market participants in different locations and time zones. Their behavior is of unprecedented complexity and the characterization and measurement of the risk inherent to this highly diverse set of instruments is typically based on complicated mathematical and computational models. Solving these models exactly in closed form, even at a single instrument level, is typically not possible, and therefore we have to look for efficient numerical algorithms. This has become even more urgent and complex recently, as the credit crisis has clearly demonstrated the role of cascading effects going from single instruments through portfolios of single institutions to even the interconnected trading network. Understanding this requires a multi-scale and holistic approach where interdependent risk factors such as market, credit, and liquidity risk are modeled simultaneously and at different interconnected scales.

=== Computational biology ===

Exciting new developments in biotechnology are now revolutionizing biology and biomedical research. Examples of these techniques are high-throughput sequencing, high-throughput quantitative PCR, intra-cellular imaging, in-situ hybridization of gene expression, three-dimensional imaging techniques like Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy, and Optical Projection (micro)-Computer Tomography. Given the massive amounts of complicated data that is generated by these techniques, their meaningful interpretation, and even their storage, form major challenges calling for new approaches. Going beyond current bioinformatics approaches, computational biology needs to develop new methods to discover meaningful patterns in these large data sets. Model-based reconstruction of gene networks can be used to organize the gene expression data in a systematic way and to guide future data collection. A major challenge here is to understand how gene regulation is controlling fundamental biological processes like biomineralization and embryogenesis. The sub-processes like gene regulation, organic molecules interacting with the mineral deposition process, cellular processes, physiology, and other processes at the tissue and environmental levels are linked. Rather than being directed by a central control mechanism, biomineralization and embryogenesis can be viewed as an emergent behavior resulting from a complex system in which several sub-processes on very different temporal and spatial scales (ranging from nanometer and nanoseconds to meters and years) are connected into a multi-scale system. One of the few available options to understand such systems is by developing a multi-scale model of the system.

=== Complex systems theory ===

Using information theory, non-equilibrium dynamics, and explicit simulations, computational systems theory tries to uncover the true nature of complex adaptive systems.

=== Computational science and engineering ===
Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with high-performance computing, to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena (computational science). CSE has become accepted amongst scientists, engineers and academics as the &quot;third mode of discovery&quot; (next to theory and experimentation). In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure computer science, nor with computer engineering, although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high-performance computing), and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

==Methods and algorithms==
Algorithms and mathematical methods used in computational science are varied. Commonly applied methods include:
* Computer algebra, including symbolic computation in fields such as statistics, equation solving, algebra, calculus, geometry, linear algebra, tensor analysis (multilinear algebra), optimization
* Numerical analysis, including Computing derivatives by finite differences
** Application of Taylor series as convergent and asymptotic series
** Computing derivatives by Automatic differentiation (AD)
** Finite element method for solving PDEs
** High order difference approximations via Taylor series and Richardson extrapolation
** Methods of integration on a uniform mesh: rectangle rule (also called &quot;midpoint rule&quot;), trapezoid rule, Simpson&#x27;s rule
** Runge–Kutta methods for solving ordinary differential equations
** Newton&#x27;s method
* Discrete Fourier transform
* Monte Carlo methods
* Numerical linear algebra, including decompositions and eigenvalue algorithms
* Linear programming
* Branch and cut
* Branch and bound
* Molecular dynamics, Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics
* Space mapping
* Time stepping methods for dynamical systems
Historically and today, Fortran remains popular for most applications of scientific computing. Other programming languages and computer algebra systems commonly used for the more mathematical aspects of scientific computing applications include GNU Octave, Haskell, Julia, Maple, Mathematica, MATLAB, Python (with third-party SciPy library), Perl (with third-party PDL library), R, Scilab, and TK Solver. The more computationally intensive aspects of scientific computing will often use some variation of C or Fortran and optimized algebra libraries such as BLAS or LAPACK. In addition, parallel computing is heavily used in scientific computing to find solutions of large problems in a reasonable amount of time. In this framework, the problem is either divided over many cores on a single CPU node (such as with OpenMP), divided over many CPU nodes networked together (such as with MPI), or is run on one or more GPUs (typically using either CUDA or OpenCL).

Computational science application programs often model real-world changing conditions, such as weather, airflow around a plane, automobile body distortions in a crash, the motion of stars in a galaxy, an explosive device, etc. Such programs might create a &#x27;logical mesh&#x27; in computer memory where each item corresponds to an area in space and contains information about that space relevant to the model. For example, in weather models, each item might be a square kilometer; with land elevation, current wind direction, humidity, temperature, pressure, etc. The program would calculate the likely next state based on the current state, in simulated time steps, solving differential equations that describe how the system operates, and then repeat the process to calculate the next state.

==Conferences and journals==

In 2001, the &quot;International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)&quot; was first organized. Since then, it has been organized yearly. ICCS is an A-rank conference in the CORE ranking.

The &quot;Journal of Computational Science&quot; published its first issue in May 2010. The &quot;Journal of Open Research Software&quot; was launched in 2012&quot;.&quot;
The ReScience C initiative, which is dedicated to replicating computational results, was started on GitHub in 2015.

==Education==
At some institutions, a specialization in scientific computation can be earned as a &quot;minor&quot; within another program (which may be at varying levels). However, there are increasingly many bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs in computational science. The joint degree program master program computational science at the University of Amsterdam and the in computational science was first offered in 2004. In this program, students:
* learn to build computational models from real-life observations;
* develop skills in turning these models into computational structures and in performing large-scale simulations;
* learn theories that will give a firm basis for the analysis of complex systems;
* learn to analyze the results of simulations in a virtual laboratory using advanced numerical algorithms.

ETH Zurich offers a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in Computational Science and Engineering. The degree equips students with the ability to understand scientific problem and apply numerical methods to solve such problems. The directions of specializations include Physics, Chemistry, Biology and other Scientific and Engineering disciplines.

George Mason University has offered a multidisciplinary doctorate Ph.D. program in Computational Sciences and Informatics starting from 1992.

The School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (erstwhile School of Information Technology) also offers a vibrant master&#x27;s science program for computational science with two specialties: Computational Biology and Complex Systems.

He appeared in commercials in the mid-1990s, before starring in the series &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot; (2004–2005) and the movies &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; (2004) and &quot;Hoot&quot; (2006). Lerman gained further recognition for playing the title character in the &quot;Percy Jackson&quot; film series (2010–2013) and d&#x27;Artagnan in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (2011), as well as for starring in the coming-of-age drama &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; (2012). He had major roles in the films &quot;Noah&quot; (2014), &quot;Fury&quot; (2014) and &quot;Indignation&quot; (2016), and returned to television with the thriller series &quot;Hunters&quot; (2020–2023).

==Early life and background==
Lerman was born in Beverly Hills, California. His mother, Lisa (née Goldman), works as his manager, and his father, Larry Lerman, is a businessman and orthotist. He has an older sister and an older brother.

Lerman is Jewish, and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony. His grandparents were born in four different countries. His paternal grandfather, Max Lerman, was born in Berlin, in 1927, to a Polish Jewish family; they left Germany in the 1930s because of the Nazi regime, and lived in Shanghai until the end of World War II. His paternal grandmother, Mina (née Schwartz), was born in Mexico City, to Russian Jewish parents. His maternal grandfather was a Polish Jewish immigrant, and his maternal grandmother was born in Los Angeles, also to a Jewish immigrant family. On his mother&#x27;s side he is a relative, by marriage, of twin singers Evan and Jaron Lowenstein.

Lerman has stated that he is a &quot;black sheep&quot; in his household because he is an actor, while most of his relatives work in the medical profession. His family owns and operates an orthotics and prosthetics company which was founded by his great-grandfather in 1915. He attended Beverly Hills High School. In 2010, he applied to study creative writing at New York University, but postponed his attendance.

==Acting career==
===Early work===
Lerman had a passion for movies from a young age, though he started acting &quot;just for fun&quot; and &quot;to do something to get out of school&quot;. He began auditioning for roles in the late 1990s, and first appeared in commercials. He made his film debut in 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Patriot&quot;, playing William Martin, one of the lead character&#x27;s children. The same year, he appeared in &quot;What Women Want&quot;. In 2001&#x27;s &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot;, he played the son of the main character. Lerman has stated that while appearing in his earliest roles as a child, he did not have &quot;any conscious awareness of what I was doing or what was going on&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t have a good experience&quot;.
In 2003, Lerman played nine-year-old Luke Chandler in the CBS made-for-television film &quot;A Painted House&quot;, based on the early life of author John Grisham and set in Black Oak, Arkansas in the early 1950s. &quot;A Painted House&quot; was filmed in Lepanto and Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 2002. A review in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described Lerman as a &quot;promising newcomer&quot;, with the &quot;Telegraph-Herald&quot; commenting on the character having been &quot;quietly and effectively played&quot;. For the role, he was nominated for the Young Artist Award for Best Performance by a Leading Young Actor in a television production, and tied with Calum Worthy for the win. He next appeared in the 2004 thriller film &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, portraying a seven-year-old version of character Evan Treborn. digitallyOBSESSED&#x27;s reviewer described Lerman as &quot;definitely a child actor to watch&quot;.

Lerman had quit acting for a &quot;year or so&quot; in the early 2000s, when he was ten. He made a &quot;conscious decision&quot; to embrace acting as a profession when he was twelve, having developed an interest in the film making process. In 2004, he was cast in the television series &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;, playing one of the title roles, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; McCallister, a 12-year-old &quot;extremely bright social misfit&quot; in Missouri who was destined to become President of the United States as an adult. The show ran on The WB Television Network during the 2004–2005 season, receiving some positive reviews but low ratings, and was subsequently canceled. Lerman was nominated for another Young Artist Award for his performance, tying with Jack DeSena for the win. Lerman has stated that he &quot;started taking things seriously&quot; about his career after appearing on the show. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot;″s reviewer mentioned that Lerman&#x27;s performance had a &quot;blend of vulnerability and strength&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s reviewer had noted that &quot;Lerman lends Bobby a bedraggled optimism&quot;.

Continuing his film work, Lerman had his first starring role in a motion picture, playing Roy Eberhardt in the children&#x27;s adventure &quot;Hoot&quot;; his character moves to Florida from Montana and attempts to save endangered burrowing owls. Lerman stated that the film&#x27;s message is &quot;that you can be any age and make a difference&quot;. &quot;Hoot&quot; began filming in July 2005 in South Florida, opened on May 5, 2006, and won him a third Young Artist Award, this time for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actor (2007). &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s reviewer commented that &quot;Lerman shows some life as Roy&quot;, though his role was &quot;an anomaly in a sea of insipidity&quot;, while the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s reviewer disliked Lerman&#x27;s performance.

In 2007, Lerman appeared in the thriller &quot;The Number 23&quot;, in which he played the son of Walter Sparrow, a man who becomes obsessed with numerology. That year, he also appeared in the critically acclaimed western remake &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, playing William Evans, a teenager who looks up to criminal Ben Wade while shunning his father; Lerman&#x27;s character did not exist in the original version of the story. Lerman received positive reviews for his work, and was again nominated for the Young Artist Award – Best Performance in a Feature Film – Leading Young Actor (2008). It was the second consecutive year he received a nomination in that category, although this time he did not win. &quot;USA Today&quot; stated that he was among the film&#x27;s &quot;best supporting players&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave Lerman a &quot;shout-out&quot; and &quot;Newsday&quot; stated that he delivers a &quot;credibly explicit note&quot;.

In 2008, Lerman co-starred in the comedy &quot;Meet Bill&quot;, as a teenager mentored by Bill. &quot;Meet Bill&quot; was filmed in 2006, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2007, and received a theatrical release on April 4, 2008. Hollywood.com stated that, though the film was uneven, Lerman &quot;displays a supreme confidence&quot;. In 2009, he appeared in the science fiction film &quot;Gamer&quot;, as Simon, a teenage gamer who controls one of the characters in a video game played with live human subjects Also that year, Lerman had a leading role in the comedy &quot;My One and Only&quot;, playing a teenage character based on actor George Hamilton – depicted as an aspiring writer who, after his parents split, accompanies his mother and brother on a cross-country trip, eventually arriving in Hollywood. Bloomberg&#x27;s reviewer described Lerman as appealing, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Betsy Sharkey stating that the character &quot;captures the ease with which an angry teen will use a growing vocabulary to wound a parent&quot;.

===&quot;Percy Jackson&quot; to present===

In spring 2009, Lerman was cast in the lead role as Percy Jackson in &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot;. The movie was filmed in 2009 in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was released in February 2010. Lerman has stated that he was not familiar with the book series when he received the script. During his teenage years, Lerman and his family had viewed his acting work as just a &quot;hobby&quot; before college; his parents had only become more comfortable with acting as a career in 2010, the year of &quot;Percy Jackson&quot; release. In August 2010, Lerman appeared in &quot;Change the Odds&quot;, a public service announcement video for the Stand Up to Cancer charity.

Lerman&#x27;s next role was d&#x27;Artagnan, in director Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s 3D film version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, which was released in the U.S. on October 21, 2011. Lerman was cast in the role without having to audition. He took the role because &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; was one of the only books his paternal grandfather had taken with him when he &quot;had to leave his home... as a young kid&quot;, in the 1930s. Lerman trained in sword fighting for three months and wore hair extensions to portray d&#x27;Artagnan, whom he has described as &quot;the most different character to me that I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. The film received negative reviews, with Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writing that &quot;Lerman already has done solid work... but he&#x27;s a blank slate here&quot;.

Lerman starred in a film adaptation of Stephen Chbosky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;, playing the lead role, Charlie; filming took place in 2011, and the movie was released in September 2012. Lerman has described the film as a &quot;life epic&quot;, and stated that he had been &quot;torturing [himself] for... a few months in order to get inside Charlie&#x27;s head&quot;. The movie received positive reviews, as did Lerman&#x27;s performance. Leonard Maltin wrote that Lerman and his co-stars are &quot;soulful&quot;, and &quot;lift this film above the norm for coming-of-age stories&quot;, while Christy Lemire of the Associated Press wrote that, by the film&#x27;s end, Lerman &quot;bust[s] out, show[s] some range and reveal[s] he can really, truly act&quot;. For his performance, Lerman was nominated for several awards, including Best Young Actor/Actress by the Broadcast Film Critics Association, and won a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor: Drama.

Lerman played Lou in the independent drama film &quot;Stuck in Love&quot;; the film received a limited U.S. release in 2013.

Filming began in September 2013, and the movie received an October 2014 release. Reviews for &quot;Fury&quot; were positive; Matt Stieb of the &quot;San Antonio Current&quot; wrote that Lerman &quot;manages to hold his own&quot; opposite co-star Brad Pitt, and Lerman&#x27;s performance was described as a &quot;great turn&quot; by Oliver Lyttelton of Indiewire.

Lerman played the lead, Marcus Messner, in &quot;Indignation&quot;, an adaptation of Philip Roth&#x27;s 2008 novel of the same name, directed by James Schamus; his character is a student who faces antisemitism and sexual repression while coming of age at a 1950s Ohio college. Filming began in June 2015. &quot;Indignation&quot; premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, and was theatrically released in July 2016. It received positive reviews for both the film itself and Lerman&#x27;s performance, with Tim Grierson of ScreenDaily writing that Lerman&#x27;s work &quot;seethes with his character&#x27;s burgeoning arrogance and cynicism&quot;, and David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stating that Lerman gives &quot;a performance of tremendous focus, maturity and depth of feeling, with exciting flashes of the umbrage that gives the film its title&quot;. Lerman also served as one of the film&#x27;s executive producers, receiving his first such credit.

Lerman played the Sidney Hall in Shawn Christensen&#x27;s feature drama &quot;The Vanishing of Sidney Hall&quot; (2017). He was also an executive producer for the film, which began production in New York City in April 2016, and premiered on January 25, at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival.

<text>Gregory Arthur Phillinganes (born May 12, 1956) is an American keyboardist, vocalist, and arranger. A session musician, Phillinganes has contributed to numerous albums over a broad array of artists and genres. He has toured with artists including Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour and Toto, was musical director for Michael Jackson, and has released two solo studio albums.

==Biography==
Gregory Arthur Phillinganes was born in Detroit, Michigan on May 12, 1956. He began playing a neighbor&#x27;s piano by ear at the age of two, beginning lessons a few years later after his mother purchased a piano for him. He took lessons from two different instructors, then from Misha Kotler, a Detroit Symphony Orchestra pianist who introduced the discipline and technique Phillinganes required. He credits Kotler with showing him proper hand posture and for influencing him to play with &quot;a sense of dexterity and definition&quot;.

After drummer Ricky Lawson gave Stevie Wonder a cassette of Phillinganes&#x27; instrumental renditions of his own songs, Phillinganes auditioned for Wonder&#x27;s band, Wonderlove, and played with them from 1976 to 1981.
The year 1978 began a three-decade-long involvement with Michael Jackson and the Jacksons for Phillinganes. He arranged the Jacksons&#x27; 1978 album &quot;Destiny&quot; and played keyboard on their follow-up album &quot;Triumph&quot;. He accompanied the Jackson family to Walt Disney World and referred to Katherine Jackson as &quot;Mom&quot;. 

Phillinganes contributed to Michael&#x27;s solo albums. He was paid as a session musician for his contributions to Jackson&#x27;s best-selling &quot;Thriller&quot;, but did not receive royalties.

He served as the musical director for Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Dangerous&quot; concert tours, and the Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special. In 2022, Phillinganes was mentioned in several episodes of the podcast series &quot;Stories in the Room: Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller Album Podcast&quot;.

In 1981, Phillinganes released his first solo album, &quot;Significant Gains&quot;. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reviewer Richard Cromonic noted Wonder&#x27;s influence on the album and praised the creativity of the compositions. He criticized the lyrics as being less creative, and said that &quot;Significant Gains&quot; might be too close to Wonder&#x27;s sound, calling it &quot;blatant emulation&quot;. The album was not successful, but the song &quot;Baby, I Do Love You&quot; was a minor R&amp;B hit. Three years later, Phillinganes released his follow-up album &quot;Pulse&quot;, with another minor hit, a cover of Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s song &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, with additional lyrics by Michael Jackson. This single was more successful on the dance music charts. When he later joined Eric Clapton&#x27;s backing band, Phillinganes introduced the tune to Clapton, who covered it on his 1986 &quot;August&quot; album. Throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s he made solo recordings and toured with Clapton and worked as a session musician for several artists. He continued session work in later years.

Phillinganes has worked and toured with musicians including Stevie Wonder, George Harrison, the Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Anita Baker, George Benson, Karen Carpenter, Eric Clapton, John Mayer, Donald Fagen, Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Michael Jackson, Richard Marx, Paul McCartney, Al Jarreau, Quincy Jones, and Stevie Nicks. In 1995, he played on the Joan Armatrading album &quot;What&#x27;s Inside&quot;. 

Starting in 2003, Phillinganes filled in for the semi-retired David Paich on tour with the band Toto. He became a full-time member of the band by 2005, and contributed to their album &quot;Falling in Between&quot;. He continued to tour as a member of Toto until the band became inactive in 2008, and did not rejoin when Toto re-formed in 2010. In 2022, Phillinganes filled in for Toto&#x27;s Dominique Xavier Taplin during the &#x27;Dogz of Oz&#x27; tour during the Norwegian shows. Toto announced in 2024 on Facebook that he and drummer Shannon Forrest were returning to the touring lineup.

Phillinganes served as the musical director for Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s &quot;Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour&quot; for its run from 2011 to 2014. Phillinganes was Musical Director for the 2014 Women of Soul performance at The White House with Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Ariana Grande and Jill Scott. In 2014 and 2015 he performed with Stevie Wonder again in the Songs in the Key of Life Tour, also serving &quot;as the tour&#x27;s Music Director.&quot; He toured with the European leg of David Gilmour&#x27;s Rattle That Lock tour.

Phillinganes won a 2015 Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Direction for his role as musical director for the television special &quot;Stevie Wonder: Songs In The Key Of Life&quot; and was music director for the 2016 Grammy Awards.

<doc id="1181030" wikidata="Q6394078" url="?curid=1181030" title="Kermit Schafer">
<text>Kermit Schafer (March 24, 1914 – March 8, 1979) was an American writer and producer for radio and television in the 1950s and 1960s. He is best known for his collections of &quot;bloopers&quot;—the word Schafer popularized for mistakes and gaffes of radio and TV announcers and personalities.

==Early bloopers==
Bloopers came into prominence in 1931, when radio announcer Harry Von Zell mispronounced or said the name of the then-President of the United States, Herbert Hoover, as &quot;Hoobert Heever&quot; on the air, but Schafer&#x27;s is believed to be the first attempt at collecting and presenting them. Other similar famous finds of Schafer&#x27;s include ABC correspondent Joel Daly intoning, &quot;The rumor that the President would veto the bill is reported to have come from a high &quot;White Horse souse&quot;&quot;, and veteran radio host Paul Harvey breaking into uncontrollable laughter at a story about a pet poodle.

These were collected and released in LP audio collections such as &quot;Pardon My Blooper!&quot; and &quot;Your Slip is Showing&quot;, which were briefly popular in the 1960s. A movie version, &quot;Pardon My Blooper&quot;, was released in 1974. It made $1,473,000 at the box office.

These led the way for such later TV shows as &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes&quot; hosted by Dick Clark. Schafer himself gained minor celebrity under the nickname &quot;The Blooper Man&quot;. Schafer also published a number of books, such as &quot;Kermit Schafer&#x27;s Blunderful World of Bloopers&quot; (1973) and &quot;Bloopers, Bloopers, Bloopers&quot; (1984).

==Criticism and controversy==
Schafer has come under criticism from TV and radio historians who have noted his deceptive presentations in his albums. If Schafer could not obtain an actual audio recording of the event (as many of these bloopers occurred live and were not always transcribed onto recordings), he would simply hire actors and recreate the event—without offering any disclaimer. This led to some misrepresentations. For example, the blooper by Harry Von Zell described above was not recorded, so Schafer recreated it.

Schafer is historically remembered for an unwittingly libelous dramatization of an incident that never happened. On his vinyl record &quot;Pardon My Blooper!, Volume 1&quot;, Schafer replicated the famous radio show host &quot;Uncle Don&quot; Carney, who broadcast on WOR in New York City to millions of children from 1928 to 1947. In Schafer&#x27;s brief drama, Uncle Don mistakenly believes his microphone is off, then utters a contemptuous indecency.

==Legacy==
After Schafer&#x27;s death on March 8, 1979, in Miami, Florida, shortly before his 65th birthday, his title of &quot;Keeper of the Bloopers&quot; passed to Dick Clark, who hosted and produced a long-running series of blooper specials (and a weekly program) beginning in the early 1980s. When Clark picked up the mantle, recordings of bloopers were far more easily obtainable, and in fact were often provided willingly by the producers of films and TV shows as a way of promoting their product.

Clark followed in Schafer&#x27;s footsteps by releasing an album of bloopers from radio broadcasts. Clark&#x27;s TV blooper shows always carried a dedication to &quot;Kermit Schafer, Mr. Blooper&quot;, and the success of Clark&#x27;s program led to the development of many imitators which continue to be broadcast as of 2008.

==Recordings==
Seven &quot;Pardon My Blooper&quot; albums were released in the late 1950s-early 1960s on Jubilee Records. The first, named &quot;Radio Bloopers&quot;, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Schafer also issued blooper compilation albums for Kapp Records in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many of these recordings would be reissued in the 1970s by K-Tel Records. 1970s compilations were also issued on MCA Records; &quot;Best of the Bloopers&quot; in 1973, and a six-volume &quot;All Time Great Bloopers&quot; set to mark the 25th anniversary of the first blooper record in 1977. Volumes 5 &amp; 6 contained some previously unreleased material.

He produced non-blooper comedy albums, among them Jubilee releases for Will Jordan and Peter Wood in the 1960s and &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Bloopers&quot;, a spoof of the then-current CB craze in 1977. He edited a number of books transcribing bloopers, with some books covering certain themes such as bloopers from classified advertising and television broadcasts.

<text>Suzy McKee Charnas (October 22, 1939 – January 2, 2023) was an American novelist and short story writer, writing primarily in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. She won several awards for her fiction, including the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award and the James Tiptree Jr. Award. A selection of her short fiction was collected in &quot;Stagestruck Vampires and Other Phantasms&quot; in 2004. &quot;The Holdfast Chronicles&quot;, a four-volume story written over the course of almost thirty years (the first installment, &quot;Walk to the End of the World&quot; was published in 1974, and the last installment, &quot;The Conqueror&#x27;s Child&quot; was published in 1999) was considered to be her major accomplishment in writing. The series addressed the topics of feminist dystopia, separatist societies, war, and reintegration. Another of her major works, &quot;The Vampire Tapestry&quot;, has been adapted (by Charnas herself) into a play called &quot;Vampire Dreams&quot;.

==Life==
Suzy McKee Charnas was born in Manhattan to two professional artists, Maxine (Szanton) and Robinson McKee. Her father was an illustrator for Wonder Books, a company that made picture books for children, and her mother was a textile designer. Her parents divorced in her childhood. Charnas helped her mother raise one younger sister, who is six years younger than she was. Despite being from a low-income family, Charnas was able to pursue a prestigious education. She attended an arts high school in New York City and, influenced by her parents, even considered pursuing a career in the visual arts. She received her undergraduate degree from Barnard College, where she majored in economics and history. She continued her education at New York University, where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in education. She taught in Nigeria as a part of the Peace Corps.

==Influences and themes==
Charnas&#x27; work focuses on the sociological and the anthropological—rather than exclusively the technological—dimensions of science fiction. Her background in history and economics, as well as her experiences in Nigeria, have had a profound impact on her work. She had keenly explored the genres of Western, adventure, and science fiction in the books she had read earlier in her life, yet she realized that these books lacked strong female characters. She considered Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; to have been a major inspiration for the initiation of her writing career, as it was one of the first feminist novels she had encountered. Despite this, she did not intend to write feminist literature. Her work did not take a feminist slant until after the first draft of &quot;Walk to the End of the World&quot;, which she had originally intended to be political satire.

==Controversy==
When Charnas tried to publish &quot;Motherlines&quot;, the second installment of the Holdfast Chronicles, she was met with some resistance. According to Charnas in an interview with SnackReads, the company that had published &quot;Walk to the End of the World&quot;, Ballantine Books, rejected &quot;Motherlines&quot; because it was deemed inappropriate for what they considered to be their target science fiction audience: young boys. This was because the book contains no male characters, and there are some controversial sexual relationships. Charnas tried to get the work published several times. It was generally rejected not for the quality of the story, but rather its controversial, even radical, themes. One editor even said that he could accept the work- and even that it would be very successful- if all the female characters were changed to men, Charnas alleged. Charnas rejected this offer. The book was finally accepted after one year (which was a long time for science fiction in this era) by editor David G. Hartwell, who went on to publish several of Charnas&#x27; other works.

==Personal life and death==
Charnas lived in New Mexico. She died on January 2, 2023, at the age of 83.

==Awards and critical reception==
Director Guillermo del Toro assessed Charnas&#x27; &quot;The Vampire Tapestry&quot; as “flawless” on Twitter in 2015, saying later “It may be her masterpiece.” Polly Shulman wrote that &quot;the Holdfast tetralogy offers a fascinating look back at the permutations of the feminist imagination in recent years, and it underlines the ideals and challenges faced by feminists -- sometimes on purpose and sometimes in spite of itself.&quot;

She won the 1980 Nebula Award for her psychological vampire novella, &quot;Unicorn Tapestry&quot;, and the 1990 Hugo Award for her feminist werewolf short story, “Boobs.” She received three Otherwise Awards, two retroactively, for novels in The Holdfast Chronicles series, beginning with 1974&#x27;s &quot;Walk to the End of the World&quot;. Charnas was awarded the James Tiptree Jr. Award for &quot;The Conqueror&#x27;s Child&quot;&quot; (1999).

<doc id="1181038" wikidata="Q6949127" url="?curid=1181038" title="Lascar">
<text>A lascar was a sailor or militiaman from the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the Arab world, British Somaliland or other lands east of the Cape of Good Hope who was employed on European ships from the 16th century until the mid-20th century.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the word has two possible derivations:

:Either an erroneous European use of Urdu &quot;lashkar&quot; army, camp [...], or a shortened form of its derivative &quot;lashkarī&quot; [...] In Portuguese &quot;c&quot;1600 &quot;laschar&quot; occurs in the same sense as &quot;lasquarim&quot; , i.e. Indian soldier; this use, from which the current applications are derived, is not recorded in English.

The Portuguese adapted the term to &quot;lascarins&quot;, meaning Asian militiamen or seamen, from any area east of the Cape of Good Hope, including Indian, Malay, Chinese, and Japanese crewmen. The English word &quot;lascarins&quot;, now obsolete, referred to Sri Lankans who fought in the colonial army of the Portuguese until the 1930s.

The British of the East India Company initially described Indian lascars as &#x27;Topass&#x27;, but later adopted the Portuguese name, calling them &#x27;lascar&#x27;.

The word &quot;lascar&quot; was also used to refer to Indian servants, typically engaged by British military officers.

==History==
===Sixteenth century===
Indian seamen had been employed on European ships since the first European made the sea voyage to India. Vasco da Gama, the first European to reach India by sea (in 1498), hired an Indian pilot at Malindi (a coastal settlement in what is now Kenya) to steer the Portuguese ship across the Indian Ocean to the Malabar Coast in southwestern India. Portuguese ships continued to employ lascars from the Indian subcontinent in large numbers throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly from Goa and other Portuguese colonies in India. The Portuguese applied the term &quot;lascar&quot; to all sailors on their ships who were originally from the Indies, which they defined as the areas east of the Cape of Good Hope.

Through the Portuguese and Spanish maritime world empires, some Indian lascars found their way onto English merchant ships, and were among the sailors on the first English East India Company (EIC) ships to sail to India. Lascar crewmen from India are depicted on Japanese Namban screens of the sixteenth century. The Luso-Asians appear to have evolved their own pidgin Portuguese which was used throughout South and Southeast Asia.

===Seventeenth century===

When the English adopted the term &quot;lascar&quot;, they initially used it for all Asian sailors on English-flagged ships, but after 1661 and the Portuguese ceded Bombay to England, the term was used mainly to describe Indian sailors specifically. The term &quot;topaze&quot; was used to describe Indo-Portuguese personnel, especially those from Bombay, Thana, Diu, Dammam and Cochin. The term &quot;sepoy&quot; was used to describe Indian soldiers in European service.

The number of lascars employed on EIC East Indiamen was so great that the Parliament of England restricted their employment via the Navigation Acts (in force from 1660 onwards) which required that 75% of the crew onboard English-flagged ships importing goods from Asia be English subjects. The restriction arose due to the high rates of illnesses and death among European sailors on East Indiamen, and their frequent desertions in Asia, which left such ships short of crew for the return voyage. Another reason was the frequent impressment of European sailors from EIC East Indiamen by the Royal Navy in times of war.

===Eighteenth century===

In 1756, a British fleet under admirals George Pocock and Charles Watson, with an expeditionary force under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Clive set off from Bombay with 1,300 men, including 700 Europeans, 300 sepoys and 300 &quot;topaze Indo-Portuguese&quot;. Their successful expedition against Kanhoji Angre is one of the first references to the British use of Indo-Portuguese servicemen and one of the first major actions involving the EIC&#x27;s Bombay Marine. Lascars also served with Arthur Wellesley on his campaigns in India during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1786, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor was originally set up to assist lascars in London. However, in a report made after one month of the committee&#x27;s existence, it was found that only 35 of the 250 recipients of aid were lascars. On Captain James Cook&#x27;s ill-fated second voyage to the Pacific, , had lost so many men (including Cook) that she had to take on new crew in Asia to get back to England. In 1797 one group of lascars was shipwrecked off the coast off Tasmania on Preservation Island on a ship built in Calcutta. The &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; wreck was the first merchant wreck after the establishment of the British colony of New South Wales.

Lascars were often paid only half of their fellow white sailors&#x27; wages and were frequently expected to work longer hours as well as being given smaller and inferior rations. The remuneration for lascar crews &quot;was much lower than European or Negro seamen&quot; and &quot;the cost of victualling a lascar crew was 50 percent less than that of a British crew, being six pence per head per day as opposed to twelve pence a day.&quot; Many lascars lived under poor conditions, as shipowners could keep their services for up to three years at a time, moving them from one ship to the next on a whim. The ill-treatment of lascars continued into the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Nineteenth century===

The British East India Company recruited seamen from areas around its factories in Bengal, Assam and Gujarat, as well as from Yemen, British Somaliland and Goa. People from India have been travelling to Great Britain since the East India Company (EIC) recruited lascars to replace vacancies in their crews on East Indiamen whilst on voyages in India. Initially, these were men from the Indo-Portuguese or Luso-Asian communities of the subcontinent, including men from Bombay, Goa, Cochin, Madras and the Hugli River in Bengal.

Between 1600 and 1857, some 20-40,000 Indians had travelled to Britain, the majority of them being seamen working on ships. Most Indians during this period would visit or reside in Britain temporarily, returning to India after months or several years, bringing back knowledge about Britain in the process. Lascars would normally lodge in British ports in between voyages. Some settled in port towns and cities in Britain, often because of restrictions such as the Navigation Act or due to being stranded as well as suffering ill treatment. Some were abandoned and fell into poverty due to quotas on how many lascars could serve on a single ship. Lascars sometimes lived in Christian charity homes, boarding houses and barracks.

At the beginning of World War I, there were 51,616 Indian &quot;lascars&quot; working on British ships, the majority of whom were of Bengali descent. Among them, it is estimated 8,000 Indians (some of whom would have been former lascars) lived in Britain permanently prior to the 1950s.

Language barriers between officers and lascars made the use of translators very important. Very few worked on deck because of the language barrier. Some Europeans managed to become proficient in the languages of their crew. Skilled captains such as John Adolphus Pope became adept linguists and were able to give complicated orders to their lascar crew. Often native bosses known as &quot;serangs&quot;, as well as &quot;tindals&quot; who often assisted serangs, were the only men able to communicate directly with the captain and were the men who often spoke for the lascars. Many lascars made attempts to learn English but few were able to talk at length to their European captains.

Lascars served on ships for assisted passage to Australia, and on troopships during Britain&#x27;s colonial wars including the Boer Wars and the Boxer Rebellion. In 1891 there were 24,037 lascars employed on British merchant ships. For example, the ship &quot;Massilia&quot; sailing from London to Sydney, Australia in 1891 lists more than half of its crew as Indian lascars.

By 1815, the &quot;Committee Report on Lascars and other Asiatic Seamen&quot; introduced requirements for equipping lascar workers, that they be provided with &quot;a bed, a pillow, two jackets and trousers, shoes and two woollen caps.&quot;

===Twentieth century===

Lascars served all over the world in the period leading up to the First World War. Lascars were barred from landing at some ports, such as in British Columbia. At the beginning of World War I, there were 51,616 lascars working on British merchant ships in and around the British Empire.

In World War II thousands of lascars served in the war and died on vessels throughout the world, especially those of the British India Steam Navigation Company, P&amp;O and other British shipping companies. The lack of manpower led to the employment of a total of 121 Catholic Goans and 530 Muslim British Indians on the Empress vessels of the Canadian Pacific Railway, such as the &quot;Empress of Asia&quot; and &quot;Empress of Japan&quot;. These ships served in the Indian Ocean both as ANZAC convoy ships and in actions at Aden. The ships were placed under the British Admiralty all of the Indian men were awarded medals by the Admiralty, though none of them were delivered.

In the 1950s the use of the term &quot;lascar&quot; declined with the ending of the British Empire. The Indian “Lascar Act” of 1832 was finally repealed in 1963. However, &quot;traditional&quot; Indian deck and Pakistani engine crews continued to be used in Australia until 1986 when the last crew was discharged from the P&amp;O and replaced by a general-purpose crew of Pakistanis.

===Lascars in the Mascarene Islands===

Presumably because Muslim lascars manned the &quot;coolie ships&quot; that carried Indian and Chinese indentured labour to the sugar plantations of the Mascarene Islands, the term lascar is also used in Mauritius, Réunion and the Seychelles to refer to Muslims, by both Muslims and non-Muslims.

===Lascars in Britain===
Lascars began living in England in small numbers from the mid-17th century as servants as well as sailors on English ships. Baptism records show that a number of young men from the Malabar Coast were brought to England as servants. Lascars arrived in larger numbers in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the British East India Company began recruiting thousands of lascars (mostly Bengali Muslims, but also Konkani-speaking Christians from the northern part of Portuguese Goa and Muslims from Ratnagiri District in the adjacent Maharashtra) to work on British ships and occasionally in ports around the world. Lascars made up the largest group of South Asian workers in Britain. The majority of lascars were Muslim but there significant numbers of Catholics and Hindus. Despite prejudice and a language barrier, some lascars settled in British port cities, often escaping ill-treatment on their ships as well or being unable to leave due to restrictions such as the Navigation Acts and abandonment by shipping masters. Shipowners would face penalties for leaving lascars behind. This measure was intended to discourage settlement of Asian sailors in Britain.

Lascars in Britain often lived in Christian charity homes, boarding houses and barracks and there were a few instances of cohabitation with local women. The first and most frequent Indian travelers to Britain were Christian Indians and those of European-Asian mixed race. For Muslim Indians considerations about how their dietary and religious practices would alienate them from British society were brought into question but these considerations were often outweighed by economic opportunities. Those that stayed often adopted British culture, dress and habits. Although the Indian presence in London during the 19th century mainly constituted male lascars and sailors, some women were included. In the Limehouse and Shadwell areas of London, many lascars formed communities in the Oriental Quarter, areas where they could form connections and retain degrees of fellowship. Conditions in the quarter, however, were no better than that of the streets. Joseph Salter, a Christian missionary known for his work with lascars, once stated that “We are now fairly in the Oriental Quarter; there are several houses here devoted to Asiatics, presided over by Chinese, Malays, and Indians according to the country of the Asiatic seeking companionship, how shamelessness has its premium and admirers, and honestly truth and self-respect are trampled in the dust. Here disease and death decked in gaudy tinseled robes allure the victim to the grave.” Overcrowding in dilapidated accommodation was all too often a sight; slime, dirt and excrement a common experience of life in the Oriental Quarter.

A small number of lascars settled down and married local white women, at least partly due to a lack of Asian women in Britain at the time, leading to small multiracial communities in port towns. Some of them converted to Christianity (at least nominally) as it was legally required to be Christian in order to marry in Britain at this time.

Lascars commonly suffered from poverty in Britain. In 1782, East India Company records describe lascars coming to their Leadenhall Street offices ‘reduced to great distress and applying to us for relief’. In 1785 a letter writer in &quot;The Public Advertiser&quot; wrote of &quot;miserable objects, lascars, that I see shivering and starving in the streets&quot;. During the 1780s it was not uncommon to see lascars starving on the streets of London. The East India Company responded to criticism of the lascars&#x27; treatment by making available lodgings for them, but no checks were kept on the boarding houses and barracks they provided. The lascars were made to live in cramped, dreadful conditions which resulted in the deaths of many each year, with reports of lascars being locked in cupboards and whipped for misbehaviour by landlords. Their poor treatment was reported on by the Society for the Protection of Asiatic Sailors (which was founded in 1814).

A letter in &quot;The Times&quot; stated that &quot;The lascars have been landed from the ship ... One of them has since died...the coffin being filled with food and money, under the idea that the food would maintain him till his arrival in the new other world... Some of the poor fellows have hitherto been shivering about the streets, wet and half-naked, exhibiting a picture of misery but little creditable to the English nation&quot;.

In 1842, the Church Missionary Society reported on the dire ″state of the lascars in London″. In 1850 40 lascars, also known as ″Sons of India,″ were reported to have starved to death in the streets of London. Shortly after these reports, evangelical Christians proposed the construction of a charity house and gathered £15,000 in assistance of the lascars. In 1856 &quot;The Strangers&#x27; Home for Asiatics, Africans and South Sea Islanders&quot; was opened in Commercial Road, Limehouse under the manager, Lieutenant-Colonel R. Marsh Hughes. The home helped and supported lascars and sailors from as far as China. The home helped with employment and with leaving Britain. Additionally, it served as a repatriation centre where various sailors were recruited for ships returning East. It was also used as a missionary centre with Joseph Salter of the London City Mission as its missionary. Among the things provided by the home were a library of Christian books in Asian and African languages, a store room for valuables, and a place where lascars could send their earnings back to India. Lascars were allowed entrance as long as they had the prospect of local employment, or were on a ship returning East. The collective naming of these groups as &quot;strangers&quot; reflected contemporary British attitudes.

Lascar immigrants were often the first Asians to be seen in British cities and were initially perceived as indolent due to their reliance on Christian charities.

In 1925 the Coloured Alien Seamen Order 1925 Act was brought into law by the Secretary of State for the Home Department. It stated that &quot;any coloured alien seaman who is not already registered should take steps to obtain a Certificate of Registration without delay.&quot; Any foreign seaman, regardless of whether they had been in Britain for several months, had to register with the police. In 1931, 383 Indians and Ceylonese were registered.

A letter dated 7 September 1925, from the wife of a Peshawar-born Indian domiciled in Britain and working as a sailor, describes the treatment of some Indians who were British subjects under the Home Office Coloured Aliens Seamen&#x27;s Order, 1925: &quot;My husband landed at Cardiff, after a voyage at sea on the SS Derville as a fireman, and produced his Mercantile Marine Book, R.S 2 No. 436431, which bears his Certificate of Nationality, declaring him to be British, and is signed by a Mercantile Marine Superintendent, dated 18 August 1919. This book and its certificate were ignored, and my husband was registered as an Alien. Would you kindly inform me if it is correct that the Mercantile Marine Book should have been ignored as documentary proof?&quot; Police eager to deport &quot;coloured&quot; seamen would often (and illegally) register seamen as aliens regardless of correct documentation.

The transitory presence of lascars continued into the 1930s, with the &quot;Port of London Authority&quot; mentioning lascars in a February 1931 article, writing that: &quot;Although appearing so out of place in the East End, they are well able to look after themselves, being regular seamen who came to the Docks time after time and have learnt a little English and know how to buy what they want.&quot;

In 1932, the Indian National Congress survey of &quot;all Indians outside India&quot; estimated that there were 7,128 Indians in the United Kingdom, which included students, former lascars, and professionals such as doctors. The resident Indian population of Birmingham was recorded at 100. By 1945 it was 1,000.

Surat Alley is a notable activist who fought for the rights of lascars within the Britain within the 1930s and 1940s.

===Lascars in Canada===
Lascars were on board late 18th-century and early 19th-century ships arriving on the Pacific coast of north-west North America. In most cases the ships sailed from Macau, though some came from India.
When arrived at Clayoquot Sound on the coast of Vancouver Island, the ship&#x27;s crew included three Chinese, one Goan and one Filipino.
Lascars were barred from entry to British Columbia and other Canadian ports from June 1914 until the late 1940s. Therefore, they seldom occur on landing and embarkation records, though they were frequenting the ports but remaining on board the ships.

===Lascars in Macau and Hong Kong===
After the death of James Cook in Hawaii, HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; sailed to Macau with her cargo of furs from the north-west coast of North America. The ship was very undermanned and took on fresh crew at Macau in December 1779 including a lascar from Calcutta by the name of Ibraham Mohammed.

Lascars were arriving in Hong Kong before the 1842 Treaty of Nanking. Since the island of Hong Kong was initially a naval base there were Indian lascars of the East Indies Fleet arriving at Hong Kong in those early colonial days. Lascars were housed at several streets in the Sheung Wan area where there are two roads called Upper Lascar Row and Lower Lascar Row. These are not far from the barracks established in 1847 at Sai Ying Pun for Indian soldiers or sepoys.

===Lascars in the United States===
Lascars were on board early British voyages to the north-west coast of North America. These sailors were among the multinational crew arriving from Asia in search of furs. Among these was the &quot;Nootka&quot; in 1786 that arrived at the Russian port of Unalaska and sailed on to Prince William Sound in Alaska. There were ten Indian and one Chinese lascar on this vessel. Three lascars died in Prince William Sound, Alaska. The &quot;Nootka&quot; sailed back to Asia via Hawaii, and the lascars became the first recorded Indians to sail to Alaska and Hawaii.

==Lascar ranks and positions==
These sailors served on British ships under &quot;lascar agreements&quot;, which allowed shipowners more control than was the case in ordinary articles of agreement. The sailors could be transferred from one ship to another and retained in service for up to three years at one time.

In both deck and engine room departments, the lascars were headed by a serang (equivalent to the boatswain in the deck department), assisted by one or more tindals (equivalent to boatswain&#x27;s mates in the deck department). Other senior deck positions included seacunny (quartermaster), mistree (carpenter, although a European carpenter was often carried), and kussab or cassab (lamp trimmer). An apprentice in either department was known as a topas or topaz. The senior lascar steward was known as the butler (either answering to a European chief steward or in charge of the catering department himself in a small ship). A cook was known as a bhandary.

==Portrayal in literature and cinema==
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created a lascar foil to Sherlock Holmes in &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot;. The crew of the Pequod in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851) includes a Lascar sailor. Lascars aboard the ship &quot;Patna&quot; figure prominently in the early chapters of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord Jim&quot;. Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s novel &quot;A Little Princess&quot; features a lascar named Ram Dass. Also, Caleb Carr portrays two lascars as bodyguards for a Spanish diplomat near the end of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;. In other works of Joseph Conrad, native seamen are frequently referred to by the Urdu term &quot;serang&quot; which appears to share the definition of lascar. In &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, it is speculated that Heathcliff, the main character, may be of lascar origin. Amitav Ghosh&#x27;s book &quot;Sea of Poppies&quot; portrays the British East India Company and their use of lascar crews. Shahida Rahman&#x27;s &quot;Lascar&quot; (2012) is the story of an East Indian lascar&#x27;s journey to Victorian England.
In the H. P. Lovecraft short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, Gustaf Johansen, the last living seaman of an expedition to Cthulhu&#x27;s sunken city R&#x27;lyeh, is assassinated (probably with poison needles) by two &quot;lascar sailors&quot; belonging to the evil Cult of Cthulhu.
In D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1919 silent film &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;, the opium house in London that the protagonist goes to is described on the intertitle as &quot;Chinese, Malays, lascars, where the Orient squats at the portals of the West&quot;. Ken Follett&#x27;s &quot;A Place Called Freedom&quot; mentions lascars in the second part of the novel. In the original version of Richard Connell&#x27;s short story The Most Dangerous Game, the main antagonist General Zaroff mentions hunting lascars for sport.

<text>Settimo Torinese () is a &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Turin, in Piedmont, Italy. The name &quot;settimo&quot; means &quot;seventh&quot;, and it comes from the comune&#x27;s distance from Turin, which is seven Roman miles. It is bordered by the other comuni of Leinì, Mappano, Volpiano, Brandizzo, San Mauro Torinese, Gassino Torinese, Castiglione Torinese, and Turin.

Sights include the Tower of Settimo, the last remains of the medieval castle (13th–14th centuries) mostly destroyed in the 16th century wars.

<text>Corporal Sidney Bates VC (14 June 1921 – 8 August 1944) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Upon his unit being attacked Bates charged the enemy forcing the enemy to retreat, during which he was hit several times and died later of his wounds.

==Early life==
Sidney Bates was born in Camberwell, London on 14 June 1921 to Frederick, a rag and bone man, and Gladys May Bates. At the outbreak of World War II, Bates was working as a carpenter&#x27;s labourer. He joined the British Army and served with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment in June 1940 shortly after it returned from being stationed in Delhi, British India. By 1944, the battalion was part of the 185th Infantry Brigade, itself one of three brigades forming part of the 3rd Infantry Division. The battalion landed in Normandy on 6 June 1944 as part of Operation Overlord.

The 3rd Division captured Caen on 9 July during Operation Charnwood and then took part in Operation Goodwood. The division was extracted from the stalemate and assigned to Caumont-sur-Orne in Operation Bluecoat in the drive past Vire.

==Award action==

In the afternoon of 6 August 1944 near Viessoix, France the 1st Battalion was in the process of relieving a battalion of the Monmouthshire Regiment when an attack by units of the 10th SS Panzer Division started with an artillery barrage forcing the British infantry into shelter in their positions. &quot;Panzergrenadiers&quot; supported by &quot;two or three&quot; Tiger tanks came on in column then at around 200 yards deployed into lines of infantry between the tanks with both the tanks and troops firing at the British positions

Captain Dye, a witness of the events, said that in such situations under fire it was difficult to get soldiers to fire back rather than shelter and a good section commander could do so. Bates was a section commander. Bates seized a Bren light machine gun and leaving the trench charged, moving forward through a hail of bullets firing at the enemy. Dye saw him hit and fall to the ground before getting up and advancing firing again for another 40 yards. He was hit again and got up once more staggering forward for a few more yards before falling to the ground and not moving again. His actions inspired the company who started firing back. In the face of the defensive fire, the grenadier advance slowed stopped and they went to ground then started to withdraw behind the tanks. British artillery was called down on the positions and the Germans were driven off by early evening. 

The stretcher bearers collected Bates finding him only 15 yards from a dead German soldier n subsided. Though he was alive he had been shot through the throat and leg and died in hospital two days later.

The final costs of fighting around Sourdeval for the Norfolks was 160 casualties out of 550. The recommendation for the award was made by Major Cooper-Key, the commanding officer of B Company of the 1st Battalion. The recommendation was turned down initially but Cooper-Key persevered. According to Sergeant George Smith the battalion had been on the march when they had come under fire. A Bren gunner had been killed next to Corporal Bates, who had immediately seized the machine gun and started firing on the enemy.

==Victoria Cross citation==

The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 2 November 1945, reading

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum, Norwich, England. The museum trustees purchased it for £20,000 in the 1980s. His was one of five VCs won by members of the Royal Norfolk Regiment during the Second World War.

==Grave and commemoration==
The grave of Sidney Bates can be found in the Bayeux Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Calvados, France. (Reference 20E)

There is a memorial to Bates near Perrier Ridge at Pavée about 1 km south of the hamlet of Sourdeval named in the citation (not to be confused with the market town of Sourdeval about away). At the same location a block reads &quot;In memory of the men of the 3rd Bn Monmouthshire Regt, The 1st Bn Royal Norfolk Regt and all other units who died defending this ridge against overwhelming odds, 5th to 10th August 1944.&quot;

A street in Norwich development is named &quot;Bates Green&quot; in commemoration; neighbouring streets are named after other Royal Norfolk regiment recipients of the Victoria Cross.

<text>Arthur Hugh Henry Batten-Pooll VC MC (25 October 1891 – 21 January 1971) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Knightsbridge, London, he was brought up in Bath and educated at Eton College. In June 1911 he was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion Somerset Light Infantry, a part of the Special Reserve of the British Army, resigning in July 1914. 

== First World War ==
In September 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, he was again commissioned into Special Reserve, first with the 5th Royal Irish Lancers and then the 3rd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers, serving in Ireland. In February 1916 he was posted to France with the 2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers.

He was a 24 years old Lieutenant in the Royal Munster Fusiliers, British 1st Division during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

&quot;On 25 June 1916 near Colonne, France, Lieutenant Henry-Batten-Pooll was in command of a raiding party when, on entering the enemy&#x27;s lines he was severely wounded by a bomb which broke and mutilated all the fingers of his right hand. In spite of this he continued to direct operations with unflinching courage. Half an hour later during the withdrawal, while personally assisting in the rescue of other wounded men, he received two further wounds, but refusing assistance, he walked to within 100 yards of our lines when he fainted and was carried in by the covering party.&quot;

Shortly afterwards he was promoted to the rank of captain.

He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions at Cherisy on 3 May 1917 when he rallied his men and led the attack, successfully reaching and holding the objective and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. After service as an aide-de-camp, he returned to the 2nd Munsters in August 1917, taken prisoner at Passchendaele in November 1917 and repatriated in March 1918. He then acted as a deputy assistant provost marshal and in 1919 as a liaison officer to the North Russian Expeditionary Force.

== Later life ==
He retired from the army in April 1920 and attended Balliol College, Oxford from 1922 to 1925, obtaining a Diploma in Agriculture and Rural Economics. 

He died on 21 January 1971 aged 79 and was buried in St Lawrence&#x27;s Parish Churchyard, Woolverton, Somerset.

His Victoria Cross is in the collections of the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.

<text>Gerrards Cross railway station is a railway station in the town of Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the Chiltern Main Line between and .

==History==
The station was built as part of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway and was opened on 2 April 1906 as Gerrards Cross for the Chalfonts. It is in a deep cutting that was dug for the line to maintain a very shallow maximum gradient, to allow for fast running with steam-hauled trains. The line opened after the Chalfont Viaduct was built further up the line to traverse the River Misbourne.

The original station layout was four-track, with two through roads and two platform roads. The two through roads were disused from 1985 and were completely removed by October 1989. This enabled the Up platform to be extended out and built over what used to be the Up through and platform roads, with the original Up line slewed to the Down through road. There was a small goods yard north of the line. This has now been removed, but services from Marylebone that terminate at Gerrards Cross use the siding there. There were two signal boxes at Gerrards Cross station, one on the east side of the station and one on the west side. The east signal box was closed in 1923. The west signal box was renamed &#x27;Gerrards Cross&#x27; and was located on the Down line and remained in use until 11 August 1990 when a total route modernisation was carried out by British Rail and signalling was passed to the new Marylebone Integrated Control Centre.

The new line and station effectively created the present Gerrards Cross; the original settlement lay for the most part along the Oxford Road.

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Railways to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.
The bronze &#x27;Railway Navvy&#x27; sculpture behind the Up platform was created by Anthony Stones who was commissioned in 1992 by the Colne Valley Park Groundwork Trust. The band Genesis contributed £3,000 towards the cost of the sculpture in appreciation of their song &#x27;Driving the Last Spike&#x27; on their album &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;.

In October 2007 work began on installing ticket barriers; these became operational on Monday 10 March 2008.

Between March and June 2021, the station was refurbished. The work included replacing the canopies, installing lighting across the entire station, repairs to the roof and windows, and a repaint.

==Tunnel works==
A development by the Tesco supermarket chain turned the cutting on the London side of the station into a tunnel by the use of large concrete ring segments to form the tunnel profile. The space on top of these segments was filled in to form a ground surface on which the new supermarket was built.

===Service interruption===
At 19:35 on 30 June 2005, of tunnel roof near its eastern end collapsed, depositing broken tunnel segment fragments and many tonnes of infill material on the track. News pictures showed that the concrete segments adjoining the hole, which were still in place, appeared to have bowed downwards where two segments met.

A Marylebone-bound train was standing at the &quot;up&quot; platform when the tunnel collapsed. Its driver saw the collapse and raised the alarm, so all rail traffic was stopped. No one was injured. A &quot;down&quot; train that had left had to make an emergency stop between stations and go back to Denham Golf Club to allow its passengers to alight. Again, no one was injured.

===Service restoration and line centenary===
Following work on removing infill material and various concrete segments, both those that actually failed and those that were judged unsafe but had not actually collapsed, the trackwork and signalling system were restored. Train services resumed from start of the normal timetable on Saturday 20 August 2005.

Gerrards Cross railway station had its centenary in 2006. This was celebrated with two London, Midland and Scottish Railway steam locomotives, Class 8F 48151 and Jubilee Class 5690 &quot;Leander&quot;, hauling trains between Marylebone and High Wycombe.

==Train Services==
== The Monday - Friday off-peak schedule ==

3 trains per hour to London Marylebone:
*1 is a fast service, calling at London Marylebone only
*1 is a semi-fast service, typically calling at Wembley Stadium and London Marylebone

2 trains per hour to Oxford

1 train per hour to High Wycombe

== The Saturday - Sunday off-peak service ==

3 trains per hour to London Marylebone:

2 trains per hour to Oxford

1 train per hour to Aylesbury
The station consists of two platforms, with a turn back siding just west of the station to allow trains to terminate/start at Gerrards Cross.

As recently as 2011 a single weekday service to started from Gerrards Cross, running non-stop from . An equivalent service departed from Paddington, and ran non-stop to Gerrards Cross. These trains traversed the now closed former main line between Northolt Junction and Old Oak Common Junction, in many places reduced to a single track. This section was used more frequently by freight and waste trains, and also diversions during engineering works. The service was later truncated to commence at South Ruislip, returning to High Wycombe without stopping at Gerrards Cross. In December 2018 was rerouted to West Ealing via the Greenford line. , the service no longer runs and has been replaced by a bus service.

<text>Tony Colman (born 28 April 1961), better known by his stage name London Elektricity, is an English electronic musician and co-foundedHospital Records.

==History==
The first incarnation of London Elektricity was the duo Tony Colman and Chris Goss. Founders and backbone of Hospital Records, they also pursued parallel projects under the monikers Peter Nice Trio and Dwarf Electro, but it was their tune &quot;Song in the Key of Knife&quot; under the guise London Elektricity that first gained them widespread recognition. In 1999, they released their debut album &quot;Pull the Plug&quot; on Hospital Records. Although session musicians contributed a wide range of live instruments (double bass, electric guitar, brass section, flute, strings), and jazz singer Liane Carroll provided vocals on two tracks, the LP was essentially a studio work, under the control of producer/DJ duo Colman and Goss.

In 2002, Chris Goss departed to concentrate on managing Hospital Records, leaving it a solo project of Tony Colman. The second album &quot;Billion Dollar Gravy&quot; was released in 2003. During the making of the album, the session musicians began to coalesce into a band, and Colman decided to take the band live. The line-up included Colman, Andy Waterworth, Landslide, MC Wrec, the Jungle Drummer, Liane Carroll and Robert Owens, amongst others. In 2004 they released a live DVD entitled &quot;London Elektricity: Live Gravy&quot;, which was recorded in October 2003 at the Jazz Café.

2005 saw the release of their third album, &quot;Power Ballads&quot;, using the same line-up as the live band. London Elektricity announced at Pressure (the University of Warwick&#x27;s drum and bass event) on 2 December 2005 that they had no plans to play live in future. They were joined on stage for the announcement by former member Chris Goss. Tony Colman now produces and DJs drum and bass solo under the name of London Elektricity.

Colman presents the Hospital Records podcast. It generally features many releases from Hospital Records, and a wide spectrum of drum and bass from around the globe. The podcast recently won &#x27;Best Podcast&#x27; at the BT Digital Music Awards, and has over 30,000 downloads a show. The podcast regularly involves special guests who are signed to Hospital records such as Logistics. Colman also hosted the &quot;Forza Horizon&quot; series&#x27; in-game Hospital Records radio station, alongside Goss, in &quot;Forza Horizon 2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot; .

In 2007, London Elektricity won the BBC 1Xtra Xtra Bass award for best live act. London Elektricity&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Syncopated City&quot; was released in September 2008. The month before this marked his Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1.

London Elektricity&#x27;s fifth album, Yikes! was released in April 2011, followed by &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; in November 2015.

<doc id="1181066" wikidata="Q8041586" url="?curid=1181066" title="X-ray vision">
<text>In science fiction stories or superhero comics, X-ray vision is the supernatural ability to see through normally opaque physical objects at the discretion of the holder of this superpower. The most famous possessor of this ability is DC Comics&#x27; iconic superhero character, Superman.

==In fiction==
Among the best known figures with &quot;x-ray vision&quot; are the fictional Superman, and the protagonist of the 1963 film &quot;X&quot;. The first person with X-ray vision in a comic book was Olga Mesmer in 1937&#x27;s &quot;Spicy Mysteries&quot;. She is often considered to be one of the first superheroes. In myth, Lynceus of the Argonauts possessed a similar ability.

Although called X-ray vision, this power has little to do with the actual effect of X-rays. Instead, it is usually presented as the ability to selectively see through certain objects as though they are invisible or transparent in order to see objects or surfaces beyond or deep inside the affected object or material. Thus, Superman can see through walls to see the criminals beyond, or see through Lois Lane&#x27;s dress to determine the color of her underwear (in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, Warner Brothers, 1978). In such cases, the visions seen are generally in full color and in three dimensions. How such an effect might be created via x-rays is unexplained (the x-rays from the viewer&#x27;s eyes would need to bounce back to their eyes the same way normal light reflects off objects and into the viewer&#x27;s eyes: x-rays simply pass through an object and continue on their way. X-ray films are made as x-rays pass through an object and then through the x-ray film. The images seen on x-ray film are &quot;shadows&quot; of the objects the x-rays passed through on their way to the film). As depicted, x-ray vision is actually more of a form of the supposed psychic ability of remote viewing.

==In reality==
X-rays have many practical uses for scientific and medical imaging. Security agencies are experimenting with applications of imaging devices which can &quot;see&quot; through clothing (using terahertz waves). Such devices are being deployed in some airports as a way of detecting contraband, such as guns, knives, and any other weapons in particular which may be carried beneath a person&#x27;s clothing, bag, etc. The devices have created some degree of controversy from personal privacy advocates who worry about screeners being able to see people &quot;naked.&quot; There also exist certain night-vision equipped cameras that can be modified to see through clothing at a frequency just below visible light. Such imaging is not true x-ray vision, but rather shows variations in heat radiation rising from the skin beneath the clothing which can provide some detail of the body beneath.

In comic books in the latter half of the 20th century, there often appeared an advertisement for &quot;X-ray specs&quot; which displayed the face of a smiling boy wearing glasses with spirals on the lenses looking at his hand through which he could see the bones.

While X-rays cannot be used in practice to enable seeing objects through walls, researchers have recently shown how everyday wireless signals, such as wi-fi, can be used to achieve x-ray vision.

<text>Second Lieutenant Edward Felix Baxter VC (18 September 1885 – 18 April 1916) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Felix Baxter was born in Oldswinford near Stourbridge in Worcestershire, the son of Charles and Beatrice (née Sparrow). He worked as a tutor. He competed in the 1910 Isle of Man TT Races and crashed on lap 4 at Ballacraine. The resulting damage to the front forks of his motor-cycle caused his retirement from the race.

==First World War==
Baxter was a second lieutenant in the 1/8th Battalion, The King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. The citation appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette of 26 September 1916:

He is buried at Row A, Grave 10, in the Fillievres British Cemetery, France, located 8 miles south west of Hesdin.
His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Alan Rosenberg (born October 4, 1950) is an American actor who portrayed the character Eli Levinson in both &quot;Civil Wars&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. From 2005 to 2009, Rosenberg was president of the Screen Actors Guild, the principal motion picture industry on-screen performers&#x27; union.

==Early life and education==
Rosenberg was born on October 4, 1950, and raised in Passaic, New Jersey. He was raised in Conservative Judaism.

Their first cousin, also from Passaic, is musician/songwriter Donald Fagen, co-founder of the group Steely Dan.

Rosenberg&#x27;s parents gave him money to apply to graduate school. Rosenberg said that upon graduating in 1972 from Case Western Reserve University, he found another passion, poker, and subsequently gambled away most of the money his parents sent him, leaving him only able to afford one application, to the Yale School of Drama. Rosenberg dropped out halfway through his second year at Yale. His &quot;greatest influence and best friend&quot; while there was classmate Meryl Streep.

==Career==
In 1979, Rosenberg appeared in the movie &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, as Turkey. He is also well known for his character Ira Woodbine in the sitcom &quot;Cybill&quot;. More recently, he was seen in the legal drama &quot;The Guardian&quot; as Alvin Masterson.

Rosenberg supplied the voice of the bounty hunter Boba Fett on NPR&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Rosenberg is also known for his appearance as the crazed &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; in the 1986 cult-classic &quot;Stewardess School&quot; and Paul Bartel&#x27;s screwball comedy &quot;Not for Publication&quot; opposite Nancy Allen (1984).

In 1991, he appeared in the TV film &quot;The Boys&quot;.

In 1995, he received an Emmy Award nomination for a guest-starring role in the hit drama &quot;ER&quot;. He starred in the Temptations miniseries in 1998, as long-time manager Shelly Berger.

In 1999, he began a recurring role as the hospital legal counsel, Stuart Brickman, on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. Halfway through their final season, he was added to the opening titles as a series regular.

He appeared on Broadway in &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With This Picture&quot; and &quot;Lost In Yonkers&quot;, and off-Broadway in &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot;, &quot;A Prayer for My Daughter&quot;, and &quot;Kid Champion&quot;. He most recently starred at the Delaware Theatre Company production of &quot;Partners&quot;, written by Allan Katz.

He was elected the 24th president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) on September 23, 2005. Rosenberg succeeded Melissa Gilbert, who had served as president since 2001 and chose not to run for a third two-year term. Rosenberg received 39.99 percent (10,748 total votes) of the nationwide vote of the Guild&#x27;s general membership, defeating Morgan Fairchild and Robert Conrad.

In 2005, he appeared as shady defense attorney Adam Novak in an episode of &quot;&quot; co-starring alongside his real-life wife Marg Helgenberger. Novak was portrayed as a womanizer who encountered Catherine (Helgenberger) in a bar and later became the prime suspect in two homicides. In a 2007 episode &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; he appeared as a lawyer defending a client who turned out to be guilty of two separate crimes, and yet the evidence failed to pin him down, resulting in a not guilty verdict which annoyed Catherine so much that she began to undertake further investigation.

In 2006, he appeared in a recurring role as Bruce Steinerman, the divorce attorney of Dr. James Wilson in the television-series &quot;House M.D.&quot; He has hosted episodes of the public television program, &quot;Life: Part 2&quot;, which began in 2007 and is produced in St. Paul, Minnesota. The show features panel discussions about issues that baby boomers face as they age.

In 2015, he appeared as Dr. William Golliher in the Amazon original series &quot;Bosch&quot;. In 2016, he had a recurring role as shady investor William Sutter on the USA Network drama &quot;Suits&quot;.

From 2016 to 2017, he had a recurring role in the Showtime cable series &quot;Shameless (seasons 6 - 8)&quot;. He portrayed Professor Youens, an alcoholic college professor and mentor to Lip Gallagher.

==Personal life==
Rosenberg&#x27;s first marriage was to actress Robin Bartlett, from 1976 to 1984.

He met Marg Helgenberger in New York City in 1984, while guest-starring on her soap &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. The two became friends and started dating in 1986. They married in 1989 and have one son, Hugh Howard Rosenberg (b. October 21, 1990). On December 1, 2008, Rosenberg and Helgenberger announced their separation. On March 25, 2009, Helgenberger filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in February 2010.

As a result of Helgenberger&#x27;s mother&#x27;s 27-year battle with breast cancer, Helgenberger and Rosenberg became involved in the fight against the disease. They have hosted a benefit called &quot;Marg and Alan&#x27;s Celebrity Weekend&quot; every year in Omaha, Nebraska, since 1999.

<doc id="1181082" wikidata="Q546919" url="?curid=1181082" title="Alfred Lefébure-Wély">
<text>Louis-James Alfred Lefébure-Wély (13 November 1817 – 31 December 1869) was a French organist and composer. He played a major role in the development of the French symphonic organ style and was closely associated with the organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, inaugurating many new Cavaillé-Coll organs.

His playing was virtuosic, and as a performer, he was rated above eminent contemporaries including César Franck. His compositions, less substantial than those of Franck and others, have not held such a prominent place in the repertory.

==Biography==
Lefébure-Wély was born in Paris, son of an organist. He studied with his father, Isaac-François-Antoine Lefebvre (1756–1831), who had changed his name to Antoine Lefébure-Wely after being appointed organist of the fashionable church of Saint-Roch in the 1st arrondissement. The boy was musically precocious. In the manuscript of an unpublished Mass by his father is a note:
Within two years of that occasion, Antoine Lefébure-Wely suffered a stroke, paralysing his left side. For the next five years, his son deputised for him. When Alfred was fourteen Antoine died, and the son succeeded the father as official organist of Saint-Roch. While holding the post he entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1832, studying with François Benoist. In 1835 he won first prize for organ. Following that he studied composition with Berton and Halévy. In 1838 he began a long association with the organ-builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, performing to a huge audience on the new instrument at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. A reviewer in &quot;La France musical&quot; praised Lefébure-Wely&#x27;s technical skill, but advised him to play music of a more serious style than he had developed. Lefébure-Wely, however, knew what the public wanted, and continued to perform music of a popular operatic type. When a new Cavaillé-Coll organ was installed at Saint-Roch in 1842 Lefébure-Wely incurred critical disapproval for playing a fantasia on themes from Meyerbeer&#x27;s popular opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot;. He is an author of the manual for harmonium playing technique. He was the one who introduced the harmonium to Marc Burty.
A French government website about Cavaillé-Coll calls Lefébure-Wely an &quot;exceptionally talented dandy who, better than anyone, had grasped the musical potential of the new tones and combinations to create music that was thrilling, renewing, impressive and at times heartrending&quot;. The site says of the composer, &quot;A protégé of the aristocracy, he frequented the bourgeois salons where he often performed with his wife, a singer … and his two daughters who were pianists. He was the incarnation of the organ of the Second Empire.&quot; Even Gioacchino Rossini, not known for the solemnity of most of his own music, once told Lefébure-Wely, &quot;You are admired more for your faults than your virtues.&quot;

In 1847 Lefébure-Wely moved to the Église de la Madeleine, exchanging posts with the previous organist, Charles-Alexandre Fessy. In 1849 he was in charge of the music for the funeral of Frédéric Chopin, when he transcribed some of Chopin&#x27;s piano works for the organ, attracting critical praise.

Lefébure-Wely was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1850. His contemporary, César Franck became better known as a composer, but was not as highly regarded as an organist. Adolphe Adam commented, &quot;Lefébure-Wely is the most skilful artist I know&quot;; Camille Saint-Saëns, Lefébure-Wely&#x27;s successor at the Madeleine, observed, &quot;Lefébure-Wely was a wonderful improviser … but he left only a few unimportant compositions for the organ.&quot; He was the dedicatee of the &quot;12 études pour les pieds seulement&quot; (12 Studies for organ pedals alone) by Charles-Valentin Alkan and of the &quot;Final en si bémol&quot; for organ, op. 21, by Franck.

Lefébure-Wely resigned his post at the Madeleine in 1858 to devote himself to composing a three-act opéra comique, &quot;Les recruteurs&quot;. It was premiered at the Opéra-Comique on December 11, 1861, but was not a great success. From 1863 until his death he was organist at Saint-Sulpice, where the Cavaillé-Coll instrument was the largest in France. He died in Paris at the age of 52. Many musicians and other leading figures attended his Requiem Mass. Ambroise Thomas gave the eulogy, in which he said, &quot;Lefébure-Wely has taken his place among the most eminent organists – not only of his time, but of all periods and of all schools!&quot; Lefébure-Wely was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery; his tomb was designed by the architect Victor Baltard.

==Compositions==

Lefébure-Wely&#x27;s first published composition was announced in the weekly journal &quot;Bibliographie de la France&quot; in their issue of 27 August 1831 so: &quot;Rondo composé pour le piano-forte par Alfred-Lefebure Wely, âgé de 13 ans, œuv. 1.&quot; (It was published by/available from both Lemoine and the composer&#x27;s family, according to the next line.)

Among 200 compositions Lefébure-Wely wrote works for choir, piano, chamber ensemble, symphony orchestra and an opéra comique, &quot;Les recruteurs&quot; (1861, libretto by Amédée de Jallais and Alphonse Vulpian, 1795?-1829)). In the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, David Sanger writes, &quot;His organ pieces, many of which have recently become available in modern editions, include pastorales, versets, élevations and communions, which were sentimental, lyrical works, and offertories, marches and sorties, which were louder and more akin to the operetta choruses then in vogue.&quot;

The French government website says of Lefébure-Wely&#x27;s music, &quot;His admirers called on him many times to adopt the &#x27;religious style&#x27; …. However, he had his habits and his preferences, and, above all his &#x27;clientele&#x27;. Also, even though his contemporaries were unanimous in their admiration for his improvisations, he often seems to have taken the easier alternative, the immediately accessible option, music that doesn&#x27;t ask any questions.&quot;

Lefébure-Wely&#x27;s compositions include:
*&quot;Boléro de concert&quot;, op. 166. Régnier-Canaux, s.d. (1865)
*&quot;Meditaciones religiosas&quot; op. 122. À sa majesté la reine Doña Isabel II. (1858)

<doc id="1181083" wikidata="Q981526" url="?curid=1181083" title="Sugizo">
<text>, born and better known by his stage name Sugizo, is a Japanese musician, songwriter, composer and record producer. He is best known as the lead guitarist and violinist of the rock band Luna Sea since 1989.

Sugizo started his solo career in 1997 and has since collaborated with a variety of different artists. He formed the psychedelic jam band Shag in 2002, the rock duo The Flare in 2004, and the electronica duo S.T.K (Sensual Technology Kooks) in 2005. In 2007 he became a member of the international trance/world music act Juno Reactor, and of the Japanese rock supergroup S.K.I.N. Sugizo officially joined the rock band X Japan in 2009, and became a member of the supergroup The Last Rockstars in 2022.

In addition to being known for experimenting with many musical genres, mostly rock, psychedelic and electronica, he is known for his political views and for being an anti-war, anti-nuclear, and environmental activist.

==Early life and musical education==
Yasuhiro Sugihara was born on July 8, 1969, in Hadano, Kanagawa, in Japan. His Manchukuo-born father played trumpet in the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, and his mother played cello in the same orchestra. He has a younger sister, who was the drummer in a band with Sugizo&#x27;s future Luna Sea bandmates J and Inoran. From a young age, Sugizo was brought up on classical music and studied classical music theory. At the age of three, by his father&#x27;s initiative, he started to learn to play the violin. He practiced it for 3 hours per day, but without the right type of music or composer, began to hate playing music, and coercion from his parents aggravated his feeling of repulsion. The situation persisted until the age of ten. His early favorite composers included Beethoven, Bartók, Liszt and J.S. Bach.

When Sugizo was eleven or twelve years old, he began to play the trumpet. He preferred the trumpet&#x27;s &quot;dirty&quot; image from the 1950s through the 1970s over playing the violin, which was seen as something for higher-class people. During his junior high school days, he became exposed to non-classical music types, such as the Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra, the British new wave group Japan, David Bowie&#x27;s glam rock, and the London punk scene, forming his attraction to rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. Sugizo&#x27;s parents divorced when he was in high school, and his father moved out. He has a good relationship with his mother and has since reconciled with his father, who has another family.

==Career==
===1986–1996: Early bands and Luna Sea===
Despite his father&#x27;s disapproval, Sugizo acquired a bass guitar and an electric guitar and began to teach himself how to play. He has cited three Japanese guitarists as influences; Masami Tsuchiya, Kazumi Watanabe and You. When he was around the age of 17, then in high school, Sugizo with Shinya on drums and Tezya on vocals formed a power metal band called Pinocchio, where he played as the bassist. Since the internal structure of Pinocchio was not cohesive, Sugizo and Shinya left and briefly joined Kashmir in 1988. On January 16, 1989, they both joined another band which performed at the same live houses, called Lunacy, formed by J and Inoran. With the addition of Ryuichi Kawamura, vocalist from the band Slaughter, the five formed the visual kei rock unit Lunacy. Since J was already the bass player and Inoran preferred to play rhythm guitar, Sugizo became the lead guitarist and took on his stage name, which he believes Shinya came up with. Soon they were discovered by hide (then lead guitarist of X Japan), who got them signed by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki, to his independent label Extasy Records, on which they released their debut album in 1991. Upon their first album release, the band changed their name from Lunacy to Luna Sea. They became one of the most famous rock bands in Japan, selling more than ten million records, as well as performing in China and Taiwan.

Sugizo&#x27;s first solo activity came in 1993, when he wrote his first solo song &quot;Revive&quot; for the album &quot;Dance 2 Noise 004&quot; featuring many musicians, including the group M*A*S*S, which consisted of hide, J and Inoran. In the upcoming three years, a variety of lesser-known musical collaborations and contributions took place.

===1997–2001: Solo career, &quot;Truth?&quot;===
After Luna Sea went on break in 1997, Sugizo started his own solo career and opened the independent label &quot;Cross&quot; to produce other artists and release his own records. He points out that the opening of his record label was one of his very important projects at the time, but not anymore. On July 9, his debut single &quot;Lucifer&quot; was released and reached number 8 on the Oricon singles chart. It was followed by his first solo tour Abstract Day which lasted until the final performance in August at Akasaka Blitz, where he was joined by DJ Krush, Masami Tsuchiya and members of Japan. Then on September 10 he released his second single, &quot;A Prayer&quot;, which reached number 7 on the charts. On November 19, his first solo album &quot;Truth?&quot; was released, and reached number 12 on the album charts. It was met with mixed reviews, largely because of the unexpected musical style which mixed different genres with electronica beats. A variety of artists participated in the album, from Ryuichi Sakamoto and Mick Karn, to Lou Rhodes and Valerie Etienne. Towards the end of the year, remix editions of his two maxi singles and album were released.

As Luna Sea resumed activities, until the band&#x27;s disbandment, Sugizo collaborated in the studio with actress Miki Nakatani and singers Miu Sakamoto and Vivian Hsu, among others. On August 11, 1999, a compilation album titled &quot;Grand Cross 1999&quot;, sponsored by Sugizo&#x27;s record label Cross, was released, featuring many musicians with whom he had worked with before and many for the first time.

He starred in Ken Nikai&#x27;s movie &quot;Soundtrack&quot; and composed the music for the film. On November 14, a compilation album inspired by the film, titled &quot;Parallel Side of Soundtrack&quot; was released, and the following year he released the single &quot;Rest in Peace &amp; Fly Away&quot; featuring Bice on vocals. That same year he produced the music for, as well as danced in, &quot;Suichoku no Yume&quot;, a production by the popular contemporary dance company H. Art Chaos.

===2002–2007: &quot;C:Lear&quot;, joining Juno Reactor===
Around late 2001 he formed the solo project Sugizo &amp; the Spank Your Juice, with whom he toured with until 2004 and released three singles; &quot;Super Love&quot;, &quot;Dear Life&quot; and &quot;No More Machineguns Play the Guitar&quot;, which entered top 50 on the charts. In 2002, he formed the jam band Shag. His acting career also continued in 2002, when he starred in Isao Yukisada&#x27;s film &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll Mishin&quot;, and the television series &quot;RedЯum&quot;, directed by Ken Nikai. In 2003, following the release of &quot;No More Machineguns Play the Guitar&quot;, Sugizo released his second album &quot;C:Lear&quot;. It peaked at the number 56 on the album charts.

The album featured various music genres, such as rock, trance, jazz, classic, bossa nova, among others, and spans his ten years of solo work. During the year, Sugizo wrote a song titled &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, named after the Boeing B-29 bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He wrote the song to convey his feelings and thoughts toward the people who suffered from the aftermath of nuclear war, and to the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As well, that the bomb never must be dropped again, and as his live supporting drummer Greg Ellis is American, singer Origa Russian, and him Japanese, that people from former enemy states can be friends.

==Personal life==
Divorced, Sugizo has a daughter named Luna Artemis Sugihara, who was born on April 27, 1996, in Tokyo, Japan. In an interview he said that her birth has transformed him the most and &quot;when you love your daughter, you begin to love all children. Although this might sound grandiose, nothing will make me happier than seeing all children around the world lead joyous lives. I&#x27;ll be more than satisfied if I can become a tool towards that goal&quot;. He briefly dated Taiwanese actress Vivian Hsu.

Sugizo finds all religions interesting and reads many books about them. Since his father was a Buddhist, while his mother was a Protestant, from the young age he has often been in contact with things related to church and Protestantism. Currently, he&#x27;s more into Buddhism, or more specifically, Buddha himself. Ever since he was little he was curious about occult subjects. While in Elementary School, he became obsessed with the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Maya&#x27;s Easter Islands and the Inca. One of the very important moments were when he was around 18 or 19 years old, after reading Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s book &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;, he became even more intrigued about the spiritual world. Noting &quot;As I grew older, I was able to better understand the things that caught my attention when I was young&quot;.

Sugizo in the interview said that &quot;there are secrets held by a small elite who control the world... We spend our lives without ever being aware of the truth that is hidden from us&quot;, and so through the song &quot;Tell Me Why You Hide The Truth?&quot; meant &quot;We have to liberate freedom and rebuild it by ourselves. I think the world is in need of a revolution. To know what to believe, to know what&#x27;s really going on in this world we have to take the initiative. That&#x27;s the sort of signal I&#x27;m trying to send&quot;. However, he tries to avoid mixing ideology with music because it changes music as such.

===Activism===
In 2001, Sugizo participated in Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s N.M.L. (&quot;No More Landmines&quot;), a campaign to promote awareness of the problems of land mines and promote a ban on them, and helped in the making of the album &quot;Zero Landmine&quot;. In 2007, he participated in the project Stop Rokkasho, run by the Japanese NGO Boomerang Net and headed up by Sakamoto, created to bring attention to the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant in Aomori Prefecture. His interest in environmental issues led to attend many environmental events. In 2007, Sugizo became involved with Greenpeace, specifically regarding the whaling in Japan. He gave a name to one humpback whale (Lyra) and followed the Great Whale Trail. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Sugizo continued to yearly volunteer and offer educational assistance to the locals of Ishinomaki and Minamisōma among others.

In 2016, Sugizo made a live performance at a Syrian refugee camps of Zaatari and Azraq in Jordan . Since then one of his guitars has a sticker titled &quot;Save Syria&quot;. In 2018, as part of an event promoting cultural exchanges held jointly by Japanese companies and Palestinian NGOs, he made a live performance at an Aida Camp which audience mostly included children of Palestinian refugees in West Bank.

==Equipment==

Sugizo almost exclusively uses ESP guitars and has around sixteen signature models with them, mostly with the Eclipse body style or other Gibson-style shapes like the RD and Flying V. But their specs are more similar to the Fender Stratocaster than any Gibson, using single coil pickups, alder bodies and maple necks, 25.5&quot; scale length and tremolo arms. He later favored a P-90 in the bridge position and vintage-style trems, as opposed to the 3 single coils and Floyd Rose trems he used for most of his career. His signature models with the company feature the ESP logo written in the same font as Luna Sea&#x27;s logo, a feature also found on J&#x27;s and Inoran&#x27;s signature models.

In 2021, Sugizo bought a 1961 Gibson ES-330 which has since become his main guitar. He had always wanted an archtop guitar from the ES Series because of its association with jazz. The first one he acquired in the 1990s, a 1959 ES-175, did not &quot;fit&quot; him, so his search continued. He also owns an ES-225 and a 1956 Les Paul Custom. He acquired the latter around 1997 and used it on Luna Sea&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot;, including its singles &quot;Storm&quot; and &quot;I for You&quot;.

Sugizo also often uses Stratocaster-type guitars from Navigator, a high-end custom shop related to ESP. His acoustic guitars of choice are usually C.F. Martin Dreadnoughts. He also plays signature electric violins made by Kranz, and his bows are made by Codabow.

His amps have changed often throughout his career but are generally high-end and boutique brands, including Fender, Marshall, Mesa/Boogie, Matchless, Bogner, Custom Audio Electronics, Divided by 13 and Koch. Most recently he&#x27;s been using EVH5150&#x27;s and EVH 4x12&quot; cabs with some additional heads like a Diezel Vh4. He&#x27;s also performed using an Axe-Fx II.

His effects are numerous and spanning several pedalboards and racks, but important staples are his DigiTech Whammy pedal for pitch effects, and delays and reverbs from various Eventide pedals and the TC Electronic 2290 Digital Delay.

<text>Knightia is an extinct genus of clupeid bony fish that lived in the freshwater lakes and rivers of North America and Asia during the Eocene epoch. The genus was erected by David Starr Jordan in 1907, in honor of the late University of Wyoming professor Wilbur Clinton Knight, &quot;an indefatigable student of the paleontology of the Rocky Mountains.&quot; It is the official state fossil of Wyoming, and the most commonly excavated fossil fish in the world.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Knightia&quot; belongs to the same taxonomic family as herring and sardines, and resembled the former closely enough that both &quot;Knightia alta&quot; and &quot;Knightia eocaena&quot; were originally described as species of true herring in the genus &quot;Clupea&quot;.

As with modern-day clupeids, &quot;Knightia&quot; spp. likely fed on algae and diatoms, as well as insects and occasionally smaller fish. In a 2022 paper, researchers announced they had detected biological residues in &quot;Knightia&quot; fossils from the Green River Formation.

The genus is also known from two separate species described from China dating to the Eocene and Late Cretaceous respectively. The Eocene species &quot;Knightia bohaiensis&quot; was described in 1985 from the Bohai Bay Basin region, while &quot;&quot;Knightia&quot; yuyanga&quot; was first identified as Eocene when described from the Itu region in 1963. The age of &quot;&quot;K.&quot; yuyanga&quot; has been revised with the placement of the species&#x27; type locality in the Late Cretaceous Paomagang Formation. Additionally the species placement in &quot;Knightia&quot; has been questioned, and the species is now treated as &quot;Clupeid &quot;incertae sedis&quot;&quot;.

The Cretaceous genus &quot;Ellimma&quot; from Brazil was formerly synonymized into &quot;Knightia&quot; as &quot;Knightia branneri&quot; by Schaeffer (1947). This placement was rejected by Grande (1982) and subsequent authors, and the species moved back to &quot;Ellimma branneri&quot;.

==Anatomy==
In &quot;Knightia&quot; fish, rows of dorsal and ventral scutes run from the back of the head to the medial fins. They had heavy scales and small conical teeth. Their size varied by species: &quot;Knightia eocaena&quot; was the longest, growing up to 25 cm (10 in), though most specimens are no larger than 15 cm. &quot;K. alta&quot; was shorter and relatively wider, with specimens averaging between 6 and 10 cm.

==Predators==
A small schooling fish, &quot;Knightia&quot; made an abundant food source for larger Eocene predators. The Green River Formation has yielded many fossils of larger fish species preying on &quot;Knightia&quot;; specimens of &quot;Diplomystus&quot;, &quot;Lepisosteus&quot;, &quot;Amphiplaga&quot;, &quot;Mioplosus&quot;, &quot;Phareodus&quot;, &quot;Amia&quot;, and &quot;Astephus&quot; have all been found with &quot;Knightia&quot; in either their jaws or stomachs.

<text>Squadron Leader Ian Willoughby Bazalgette (19 October 1918 – 4 August 1944) was a Canadian-British pilot in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. On 4 August 1944, while piloting an Avro Lancaster in a pathfinder role, Bazalgette and crew flew to Trossy St. Maximin in France to mark a V-1 flying bomb storage cave. Bazalgette&#x27;s Lancaster was severely damaged by flak prior to arrival at the target and quickly set on fire. Despite the condition of his aircraft, Bazalgette continued to the target and accurately dropped his markers. After completing the task, Bazalgette ordered his crew to bail out, however, two members of the crew were wounded and unable to jump. Rather than saving himself and leaving the two men to die, Bazalgette attempted to land the burning plane to save his two crew members. Bazalgette landed the plane, but it exploded almost immediately upon alighting, killing all three airmen. For his actions, Bazalgette was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Early years==
Ian Willoughby Bazalgette was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada on 19 October 1918 to parents of English and Irish background, Charles Ian Bazalgette (1888–1956) and Marion Edith, née Bunn (1891–1977). His great-grandfather was the civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. Bazalgette was always known as &quot;Will&quot; in his family, to distinguish him from his father, who was known as &quot;Ian&quot;. Bazalgette began his schooling at the Toronto Balmy Beach School, but his family returned to England in 1927. He grew up in New Malden, England and attended Rokeby School in Wimbledon (1927–1932) and then Beverley Boys Secondary School as well as receiving private tutelage. In his childhood he suffered from poor health, and at 13 was diagnosed with clinical tuberculosis, which required four months of treatment at the Royal Sea-Bathing Hospital, Margate, in 1931.

==Second World War==
When the Second World War broke out, Bazalgette enlisted in the Royal Artillery, being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1940. After serving in the Searchlight Section as an instructor, he transferred to the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He soloed within a week of beginning his flight training at RAF Cranwell and swiftly completed his &quot;ab initio&quot; flying by 24 January 1942, given the rank of pilot officer. His first posting was to No. 25 Operational Training Unit (OTU) but by 16th of September 1942, he had joined an operational bomber squadron, No. 115 Squadron RAF at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk. Flying the venerable Vickers Wellington bomber, &quot;Baz&quot; was sent out initially on &quot;gardening&quot; sorties, laying mines in the North Sea. After 13 operations, Bazalgette and his squadron transitioned to the Avro Lancaster, completing their training in March 1943.

After completing 10 more operations successfully on raids against heavily defended targets, including Berlin, Essen, Kiel and St. Nazaire, and surviving some harrowing escapes including a crash landing, Bazalgette was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 29 May 1943. The award noted his &quot;great courage and determination in the face of the enemy&quot;.

With the end of his tour of 28 operations, Bazalgette was posted as an instructor and Flight Commander to No. 20 OTU in Lossiemouth, Scotland, before he was &quot;recruited&quot; for the Pathfinders. He transferred in April 1944 to No. 635 Squadron RAF, part of No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group, based at RAF Downham Market in Norfolk.

When his conversion training was completed, 25-year-old &quot;Baz&quot; flew as an acting squadron leader, taking part in a number of operations during and after the D-Day campaign. As the assigned Master Bomber, Bazalgette&#x27;s 58th and final operation was the bombing of V-1 rocket storage caves at Trossy St. Maximin.

==Final operation==
On 4 August 1944 at Trossy St. Maximin, France, Squadron Leader Bazalgette&#x27;s Lancaster III ND811 of No. 635 Squadron RAF was among a formation tasked to mark German positions for the main bomber force. When near the target, his bomber came under severe anti-aircraft fire from the ground, putting both starboard engines out of action and causing a serious fire. As the deputy &#x27;master bomber&#x27; had already been shot down, the success of the attack depended on Squadron Leader Bazalgette, and despite the damage to his aircraft, he pressed on to the target, marking and bombing it accurately. After the bombs had been dropped the Lancaster dived, practically out of control. Bazalgette regained control, but the port inner engine failed and the starboard mainplane was on fire.

Bazalgette ordered the members of his crew who were able to (F/L Charles Godfrey DFC, Sgt George Turner, F/O Douglas Cameron DFM, and F/L Geoffrey Goddard) to bail out. He then attempted to bring the burning aircraft to safety by attempting to land the crippled plane near Senantes (Oise). But it exploded, killing him and the remaining two wounded crew members, F/L Ivan Hibbert DFC and F/S Vernon Leeder. A memorial to Bazalgette, Hibbert, and Leeder can be seen along the road beside the farm where he landed the plane. .

Coincidentally, Flying Officer Cameron had also been a member of Flight Sergeant Ron Middleton&#x27;s crew when the Australian was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

Bazalgette&#x27;s grave is at Senantes Churchyard, 13 miles northwest of Beauvais, France. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon, England.

Bazalgette Gardens in New Malden, Surrey, where he had attended Beverley Boys School, was named in his honour during the early 1950s. A school in Calgary, Ian Bazalgette Junior High School, is also named after him.

==Bazalgette Memorial Lancaster==
At the Nanton Lancaster Society Air Museum, now the Bomber Command Museum of Canada (located in Nanton, Alberta, south of his hometown Calgary), an Avro Lancaster, FM159, after a lengthy period of reconstruction and repair, was painted in the colours and markings of Bazalgette&#x27;s aircraft. A dedication ceremony was held in 1990. Group Captain T.G. &#x27;Hamish&#x27; Mahaddie, who had honored Bazalgette&#x27;s request to be transferred into the Pathfinders, came from England to speak at the ceremony. Ethel Broderick, Bazalgette&#x27;s sister, unveiled a plaque and the markings of the Bazalgette aircraft (F2-T) were unveiled by two of Bazalgette&#x27;s crew members, Chuck Godfrey and George Turner.

<text>Life as a House is a 2001 American drama film produced and directed by Irwin Winkler. The screenplay by Mark Andrus focuses on a man who is anxious to repair his relationship with his ex-wife and teenage son after he is diagnosed with terminal cancer.

==Plot==
George Monroe, a jaded architectural model fabricator, is living the bachelor&#x27;s life in the old family shack on the coast of California. Over the years, George has been avoiding getting up to modern CAD technology standards and eventually is fired from the architecture firm. When the principal owner refuses to let George keep a few of his models, he destroys all but one of the models with a roll of design plans. As he exits the building with the remaining model, he collapses and is rushed to the hospital, where it is revealed he has advanced stage cancer and any treatment would be futile.

George, with a time limit on his life, decides to demolish the shack left to him by his father and build his own custom house. He enlists his son, Sam, who is alienated from his mother Robin and stepfather Peter, a wealthy investor. Sam is forced to spend his summer with George, who has not revealed his terminal condition and help him with the house. Initially, Sam makes it a point not to help George demo the old house. When George refuses to give Sam money unless he works for it, Sam toys with becoming a prostitute, but is nearly caught and flees from his first encounter. This leads him to steal George&#x27;s Vicodin.

George slowly reconnects with Sam. Robin decides to assist as well, and she finds herself rediscovering George. Also joining in the construction are Alyssa, Sam&#x27;s classmate who lives next door with her mother Colleen; local policeman Kurt Walker, George&#x27;s childhood friend; Sam&#x27;s young half-brothers Adam and Ryan; various neighbors; and eventually Peter, even after separating from Robin when she tells him that her feelings for George have re-awakened. George tells Robin of his disease, sending her into shock. George tells Sam, who feels betrayed and accuses George of being selfish and takes refuge at Alyssa&#x27;s house. George collapses and is found by Robin the following morning. Complications arise when neighbor David Dokos tries to halt construction because the building&#x27;s height exceeds the allowable limit by six inches. His plans to halt the project are stopped by Sam, who recognizes him from his prostitution attempt and blackmails him.

Sam puts Christmas lights all over the unfinished house and shows George the gleaming house from his hospital window. The next morning, Sam returns to finish the house and Robin sits beside George until his death. Robin goes to the house and tells Sam about his father&#x27;s death. Sam inherits the house he finished building. Sam gives the property to a woman who has been living in a trailer park. As a girl, she was injured in a car crash caused by his grandfather.

==Cast==
==Production==
In &quot;Character Building: Inside Life as a House&quot;, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, director Irwin Winkler confesses he never realized the rekindling love between George and Robin was a key aspect of the script until he saw the emotion displayed by Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas in their scenes together. Winkler encouraged his cast to improvise moments leading into and following their scripted dialogue, many of which were included in the final film.

In &quot;From the Ground Up&quot;, another DVD bonus feature, production designer Dennis Washington discusses how he was required to construct an entire street of houses leading to Sam&#x27;s house, which was perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Palos Verdes, California. The new house was built on another site, then dismantled and transported to the film set as each section was needed. Because the film tracked the progress of the dismantling of the old house and the construction of the new one, it had to be shot in sequence. When the film was completed, the house was dismantled, moved, reconstructed, and enlarged to become a library for the Kenter Canyon Elementary School in Brentwood.

An official soundtrack containing Mark Isham’s original score was released on October 30, 2001. The film includes the songs &quot;What You Wish For&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day&quot; by Guster, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way&quot; by Gob, &quot;Live a Lie&quot; and &quot;Somewhere&quot; by Default, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; by Marilyn Manson, &quot;Water&quot; by ohGr, &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; by Limp Bizkit, &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; by Joni Mitchell, &quot;Gramercy Park&quot; by Deadsy, and &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; by Radiohead.

== Release ==
The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Boston Film Festival before going into limited release in the US on October 26, 2001.

==Reception==
&quot;Life as a House&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 47% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 5.27/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A manipulative tearjerker, &quot;Life as a House&quot; benefits from fine performances from the cast.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote “‘&quot;Life as a House&quot;,’ directed by Mr. Winkler from a screenplay by Mark Andrus, certainly means well, and its be-here-now philosophy is unarguably valuable. But as it follows George&#x27;s final months during a summer in which he forms a solid bond with his estranged son, it doesn&#x27;t trust the audience enough to keep from laying on the schmaltz.”

Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars, noting “some episodes in the movie seem especially contrived.” However, he praised the performances of Kline and Thomas, saying the actors “are able to deepen their characters by sheer skill and depth of technique, so that we like them and care what happens to them.”

Despite the film&#x27;s mixed reception, Christensen&#x27;s performance received widespread praise. In a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lisa Schwarzbaum said “Christensen — soon to hit pinup status in ”&quot;Star Wars&quot;” II and III as Anakin Skywalker — is a joy to watch, but when he’s not on screen, this movie is less instructive about the tools of life than any episode of ”&quot;This Old House&quot;.”

===Box office===
The film opened in twenty-nine theaters in the US and grossed $294,056 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $15,667,270 in the US and $8,236,521 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $23,903,791.

==Awards and nominations==
==Home media==
New Line Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on March 26, 2002. It includes commentary by director/producer Irwin Winkler, producer Rob Cowan, and screenwriter Mark Andrus, as well as deleted scenes (one with William Russ, who was originally cast as Kurt Walker but replaced when he was injured in a motorcycle accident after filming began).

<text>A digital single-lens reflex camera (digital SLR or DSLR) is a digital camera that combines the optics and mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a solid-state image sensor and digitally records the images from the sensor.

The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens and then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either a prism, which shows the image in the optical viewfinder, or the image sensor when the shutter release button is pressed. The viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured by the camera&#x27;s sensor, as it presents it as a direct optical view through the main camera lens rather than showing an image through a separate secondary lens.

DSLRs largely replaced film-based SLRs during the 2000s. Major camera manufacturers began to transition their product lines away from DSLR cameras to mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) beginning in the 2010s.

== History ==
In 1969, Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith invented charge-coupled semiconductor devices, which can be used as analog storage registers and image sensors. A CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) imager provides a low-noise analog image signal, which is digitized when used in a digital camera. For their contribution to digital photography, Boyle and Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. 

In 1973, Fairchild developed a 100 x 100 pixel interline CCD image sensor. This CCD was used in the first commercial CCD camera, the Fairchild MV-100, which was introduced in late 1973. In 1974, Kodak scientists Peter Dillon and Albert Brault used this Fairchild CCD 202 image sensor to create the first color CCD image sensor by fabricating a red, green, and blue color filter array that was registered and bonded to the CCD. In 1975, Kodak engineer Steven Sasson built the first portable, battery-operated digital still camera, which used a zoom lens from a Kodak Super 8mm movie camera and a monochrome Fairchild 100×100 pixel CCD.

The first prototype filmless SLR camera was publicly demonstrated by Sony in August 1981. The Sony Mavica (a magnetic still video camera) used a color-striped 2/3” format CCD sensor with 280K pixels, along with analog video signal processing and recording. The Mavica electronic still camera employed a TTL single-lens reflex viewfinder, as shown in the graphic from a June 1982 Sony press release. It recorded FM-modulated analog video signals on a newly developed 2” magnetic floppy disk, dubbed the &quot;Mavipak&quot;.

The disk format was later standardized as the &quot;Still Video Floppy&quot;, or &quot;SVF&quot;, so the Sony Mavica was the first &quot;SVF-SLR&quot; to be demonstrated, but it was not a D-SLR since it recorded analog video images rather than digital images. Starting in 1983, many Japanese companies demonstrated prototype SVF cameras, including Toshiba, Canon, Copal, Hitachi, Panasonic, Sanyo, and Mitsubishi.

The Canon RC-701, introduced in May 1986, was the first SVF camera (and the first SVF-SLR camera) sold in the US. It employed an SLR viewfinder and included a 2/3” format color CCD sensor with 380K pixels. It was sold along with removable 11-66mm and 50-150mm zoom lens.

Over the next five years, many other companies began selling SVF analog electronic cameras. These included the monochrome Nikon QV-1000C SVF-SLR camera, introduced in 1988, which had an F-mount for interchangeable QV Nikkor lenses. 

In 1986, the Kodak Microelectronics Technology Division developed a 1.3 MP CCD image sensor, the first with more than 1 million pixels. In 1987, this sensor was integrated with a Canon F-1 film SLR body at the Kodak Federal Systems Division to create an early DSLR camera. The digital back monitored the camera body battery current to sync the image sensor exposure to the film body shutter. Digital images were stored on a tethered hard drive and processed for histogram feedback to the user. This camera was created for the U.S. government, and was followed by several other models intended for government use and eventually Kodak DCS, a commercial DSLR series launched in 1991.

In 1995, Nikon co-developed the Nikon E series with Fujifilm. The E series included the Nikon E2/E2S, Nikon E2N/E2NS and Nikon E3/E3S, with the E3S released in December 1999.

In the late 1990s, Sony introduced the &quot;Digital Mavica&quot; series of consumer digital cameras. Unlike the original analog Mavica, the Digital Mavica cameras recorded JPEG compressed image files on standard 3½-inch magnetic floppy discettes (meant to simplify camera-to-computer data transfer) and did not have an SLR viewfinder.

In 1999, Nikon announced the Nikon D1. The D1&#x27;s body was similar to Nikon&#x27;s professional 35 mm film SLRs, and it had the same Nikkor lens mount, allowing the D1 to use Nikon&#x27;s existing line of AI/AIS manual focus and AF lenses. Although Nikon and other manufacturers had produced digital SLR cameras for several years prior, the D1 was the first professional digital SLR that displaced Kodak&#x27;s then-undisputed reign over the professional market.

Over the next decade, other camera manufacturers entered the DSLR market, including Canon, Kodak, Fujifilm, Minolta (later Konica Minolta, and ultimately acquired by Sony), Pentax (whose camera division is now owned by Ricoh), Olympus, Panasonic, Samsung, Sigma, and Sony.

In January 2000, Fujifilm announced the FinePix S1 Pro, the first consumer-level DSLR.

In November 2001, Canon released its 4.1-megapixel EOS-1D, the brand&#x27;s first professional digital body. In 2003, Canon introduced the 6.3-megapixel EOS 300D SLR camera (known in the United States and Canada as the Digital Rebel and in Japan as the Kiss Digital) with an MSRP of US$999, aimed at the consumer market. Its commercial success encouraged other manufacturers to produce competing digital SLRs, lowering entry costs and allowing more amateur photographers to purchase DSLRs.

In 2004, Konica Minolta released the Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D, the first DSLR with in-body image stabilization which later become standard in Pentax, Olympus, and Sony Alpha cameras.

In early 2008, Nikon released the D90, the first DSLR to feature video recording. Since then, all major companies have offered cameras with this functionality.

Over time, the number of megapixels in imaging sensors has increased steadily, with most companies focusing on high ISO performance, speed of focus, higher frame rates, the elimination of digital &#x27;noise&#x27; produced by the imaging sensor, and price reductions to lure new customers.

In June 2012, Canon announced the first DSLR to feature a touchscreen, the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i/Kiss X6i. Although this feature had been widely used on both compact cameras and mirrorless models, it had not made an appearance on a DSLR until the 650D.

=== Market share ===
The DSLR market is dominated by Japanese companies, and the top five manufacturers are Japanese: Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, and Sony. Other manufacturers of DSLRs include Mamiya, Sigma, Leica (Germany), and Hasselblad (Swedish).

In 2007, Canon edged out Nikon with 41% of worldwide sales to the latter&#x27;s 40%, followed by Sony and Olympus, each with approximately 6% market share. In the Japanese domestic market, Nikon captured 43.3% to Canon&#x27;s 39.9%, with Pentax a distant third at 6.3%.

In 2008, Canon&#x27;s and Nikon&#x27;s offerings took the majority of sales. In 2010, Canon controlled 44.5% of the DSLR market, followed by Nikon with 29.8% and Sony with 11.9%.

For Canon and Nikon, digital SLRs are their biggest source of profit. For Canon, their DSLRs brought in four times the profits from compact digital cameras, while Nikon earned more from DSLRs and lenses than from any other product. Olympus and Panasonic have since exited the DSLR market and now focus on producing mirrorless cameras.

In 2013, after a decade of double-digit growth, DSLR (along with MILC) sales were down 15 per cent. This may be due to some low-end DSLR users choosing to use a smartphone instead. The market intelligence firm IDC predicted that Nikon would be out of business by 2018 if the trend continued, although this did not come to pass. Regardless, the market has shifted from being driven by hardware to software, and camera manufacturers have not been keeping up.

=== Decline and transition to mirrorless cameras ===
Beginning in the 2010s, major camera manufacturers began to transition their product lines away from DSLR cameras to mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs). In September 2013, Olympus announced they would stop the development of DSLR cameras and focus on the development of MILCs. Nikon announced they were ending production of DSLRs in Japan in 2020, followed by similar announcements from Canon and Sony.

=== Present-day models ===


Currently, DSLRs are widely used by consumers and professional still photographers. Well-established DSLRs currently offer a larger variety of dedicated lenses and other equipment. Mainstream DSLRs (in full-frame or smaller image sensor format) are produced by Canon, Nikon, Pentax, and Sigma. Pentax, Phase One, Hasselblad, and Mamiya Leaf produce expensive, high-end medium-format DSLRs, including some with removable sensor backs. Contax, Fujifilm, Kodak, Panasonic, Olympus, Samsung previously produced DSLRs but now either offer non-DSLR systems or have left the camera market entirely. Konica Minolta&#x27;s line of DSLRs was purchased by Sony.
* Canon&#x27;s current 2018 EOS digital line includes the Canon EOS 1300D/Rebel T6, 200D/SL2, 800D/T7i, 77D, 80D, 7D Mark II, 6D Mark II, 5D Mark IV, 5Ds and 5Ds R and the 1D X Mark II. All Canon DSLRs with three- and four-digit model numbers, as well as the 7D Mark II, have APS-C sensors. The 6D, 5D series, and 1D X are full-frame. , all current Canon DSLRs use CMOS sensors.
* Nikon has a broad line of DSLRs, most in direct competition with Canon&#x27;s offerings, including the D3400, D5600, D7500 and D500 with APS-C sensors, and the D610, D750, D850, D5, D3X and the Df with full-frame sensors.
* Leica produces the S2, a medium format DSLR.
* Pentax currently offers APS-C, full-frame and medium-format DSLRs. The APS-C cameras include the K-3 II, Pentax KP and K-S2. The K-1 Mark II, announced in 2018 as successor to the Pentax K-1, is the current full-frame model. The APS-C and full-frame models have extensive backward compatibility with Pentax and third-party film era lenses from about 1975, those that use the Pentax K mount. The Pentax 645Z medium format DSLR is also back-compatible with Pentax 645 system lenses from the film era.
* Sigma produces DSLRs using the Foveon X3 sensor, rather than the conventional Bayer sensor. This is claimed to give higher colour resolution, although headline pixel counts are lower than conventional Bayer-sensor cameras. It currently offers the entry-level SD15 and the professional SD1. Sigma is the only DSLR manufacturer that sells lenses for other brands&#x27; lens mounts.
* Sony has modified the DSLR formula in favor of single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony&#x27;s SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as the continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 per cent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop-loss light, but the rest of this light is continuously reflected onto the camera&#x27;s phase-detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during the video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.

== Design ==
Like SLRs, DSLRs typically use interchangeable lenses with a proprietary lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system is switched down (to precisely a 45-degree angle) to direct light from the lens over a matte focusing screen via a condenser lens and a pentaprism/pentamirror to an optical viewfinder eyepiece. Most entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.

Focusing can be manual, by twisting the focus on the lens; or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on the shutter release or a dedicated auto-focus (AF) button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards in the direction of the arrow, the focal-plane shutter opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor. After these actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built-in drive mechanism re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.

Compared with the newer concept of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, this mirror/prism system is the characteristic difference, providing direct, accurate optical preview with separate autofocus and exposure metering sensors. Essential parts of all digital cameras are some electronics like amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, image processors, and other microprocessors for processing the digital image, performing data storage, and/or driving an electronic display.

DSLRs typically use autofocus based on phase detection. This method allows the optimal lens position to be calculated rather than &quot;found&quot;, as would be the case with autofocus based on contrast maximization. Phase-detection autofocus is typically faster than other passive techniques. As the phase sensor requires the same light going to the image sensor, it was previously only possible with an SLR design. However, with the introduction of focal-plane phase-detect autofocusing in mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras by Sony, Fuji, Olympus, and Panasonic, cameras can now employ both phase detect and contrast-detect AF points.

== Common features ==

=== Mode dial ===

Digital SLR cameras, along with most other digital cameras, generally have a mode dial to access standard camera settings or automatic scene-mode settings. Sometimes called a &quot;PASM&quot; dial, they typically provide modes such as program, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and full manual modes. Scene modes vary from camera to camera, and these modes are inherently less customizable. They often include landscape, portrait, action, macro, night, and silhouette, among others. However, these different settings and shooting styles that &quot;scene&quot; mode provides can be achieved by calibrating certain settings on the camera.

=== Dust reduction systems ===
A method to prevent dust from entering the chamber by using a &quot;dust cover&quot; filter right behind the lens mount was used by Sigma in its first DSLR, the Sigma SD9, in 2002.

Olympus used a built-in sensor cleaning mechanism in its first DSLR that had a sensor exposed to air, the Olympus E-1, in 2003 (all previous models each had a non-interchangeable lens, preventing direct exposure of the sensor to outside environmental conditions).

Several Canon DSLR cameras rely on dust reduction systems based on vibrating the sensor at ultrasonic frequencies to remove dust from the sensor.

=== Interchangeable lenses ===

The ability to exchange lenses, to select the best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialized lenses is one of the key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar, that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a camera body with a different lens mount, but with often reduced functionality.

Many lenses are mountable, &quot;diaphragm-and-meter-compatible&quot;, on modern DSLRs, and on older film SLRs that use the same lens mount. However, when lenses designed for 35  mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors, the image is effectively cropped and the lens appears to have a longer focal length than its stated focal length. Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimised for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing 35  mm mount DSLRs, mostly in the wide-angle range. These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full-frame sensors or 35  mm film because of the smaller imaging circle and with some Canon EF-S lenses, interfere with the reflex mirrors on full-frame bodies.

=== HD video capture ===

Since 2008, manufacturers have offered DSLRs which offer a movie mode capable of recording high definition motion video. A DSLR with this feature is often known as an HDSLR or DSLR video shooter. The first DSLR introduced with an HD movie mode, the Nikon D90, captures video at 720p24 (1280x720 resolution at 24 frame/s). Other early HDSLRs capture video using a nonstandard video resolution or frame rate. For example, the Pentax K-7 uses a nonstandard resolution of 1536×1024, which matches the imager&#x27;s 3:2 aspect ratio. The Canon EOS 500D (Rebel T1i) uses a nonstandard frame rate of 20 frame/s at 1080p, along with a more conventional 720p30 format.

In general, HDSLRs use the full imager area to capture HD video, though not all pixels (causing video artifacts to some degree). Compared with the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder, the HDSLR&#x27;s much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics. HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low-light performance. However, the low ratio of active pixels (to total pixels) is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts (such as moiré patterns) in scenes with particular textures, and CMOS rolling shutter tends to be more severe. Furthermore, due to the DSLR&#x27;s optical construction, HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on standard dedicated camcorders, such as autofocus while shooting, powered zoom, and an electronic viewfinder/preview. These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point-and-shoot camcorder, instead of demanding some level of planning and skill for location shooting.

Video functionality has continued to improve since the introduction of the HDSLR, including higher video resolution (such as 1080p24) and video bitrate, improved automatic control (autofocus) and manual exposure control, and support for formats compatible with high-definition television broadcast, Blu-ray disc mastering or Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI). The Canon EOS 5D Mark II (with the release of firmware version 2.0.3/2.0.4.) and Panasonic Lumix GH1 were the first HDSLRs to offer 1080p video at 24fps, and since then the list of models with comparable functionality has grown considerably.

The rapid maturation of HDSLR cameras has sparked a revolution in digital filmmaking (referred to as &quot;DSLR revolution&quot;), and the &quot;Shot On DSLR&quot; badge is a quickly growing phrase among independent filmmakers. Canon&#x27;s North American TV advertisements featuring the Rebel T1i have been shot using the T1i itself. Other types of HDSLRs found their distinct application in the field of documentary and ethnographic filmmaking, especially due to their affordability, technical and aesthetical features, and their ability to make observation highly intimate. An increased number of films, television shows, and other productions are utilizing the quickly improving features. One such project was Canon&#x27;s &quot;Story Beyond the Still&quot; contest that asked filmmakers to collectively shoot a short film in 8 chapters, with each chapter being shot over a short period of time and a winner was determined for each chapter. After 7 chapters the winners collaborated to shoot the final chapter of the story. Due to the affordability and convenient size of HDSLRs compared with professional movie cameras, The Avengers used five Canon EOS 5D Mark II and two Canon 7D to shoot the scenes from various vantage angles throughout the set and reduced the number of reshoots of complex action scenes.

Manufacturers have sold optional accessories to optimize a DSLR camera as a video camera, such as a shotgun-type microphone, and an External EVF with 1.2 million pixels.

=== Live preview ===

Early DSLRs lacked the ability to show the optical viewfinder&#x27;s image on the LCD display – a feature known as live preview. Live preview is useful in situations where the camera&#x27;s eye-level viewfinder cannot be used, such as underwater photography where the camera is enclosed in a plastic waterproof case.

In 2000, Olympus introduced the Olympus E-10, the first DSLR with live preview – albeit with an atypical fixed lens design. , some DSLRs from Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Leica, Pentax, Samsung and Sony all provided continuous live preview as an option. Additionally, the Fujifilm FinePix S5 Pro offers 30 seconds of live preview.

On almost all DSLRs that offer live preview via the primary sensor, the phase-detection autofocus system does not work in the live preview mode, and the DSLR switches to a slower contrast system commonly found in point-and-shoot cameras. While even phase detection autofocus requires contrast in the scene, strict contrast-detection autofocus is limited in its ability to find focus quickly, though it is somewhat more accurate.

In 2012, Canon introduced hybrid autofocus technology to the DSLR in the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i, and introduced a more sophisticated version, which it calls &quot;Dual Pixel CMOS AF&quot;, with the EOS 70D. The technology allows certain pixels to act as both contrast-detection and phase-detection pixels, thereby greatly improving autofocus speed in live view (although it remains slower than pure phase detection). While several mirrorless cameras, plus Sony&#x27;s fixed-mirror SLTs, have similar hybrid AF systems, Canon is the only manufacturer that offers such technology in DSLRs.

A new feature via a separate software package introduced from Breeze Systems in October 2007, features live view from a distance. The software package is named &quot;DSLR Remote Pro v1.5&quot; and enables support for the Canon EOS 40D and 1D Mark III.

=== Sensor size and image quality ===

Image sensors used in DSLRs come in a range of sizes. The very largest are the ones used in &quot;medium format&quot; cameras, typically via a &quot;digital back&quot; which can be used as an alternative to a film back. Because of the manufacturing costs of these large sensors, the price of these cameras is typically over $1,500 and easily reaching $8,000 and beyond .

&quot;Full-frame&quot; is the same size as 35 mm film (135 film, image format 24×36 mm); these sensors are used in DSLRs such as the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, 5DS/5DSR, 5D Mark IV and 6D Mark II, and the Nikon D5, D850, D750, D610 and Df. Most lower-cost DSLRs use a smaller sensor that is APS-C sized, which is approximately 24×16 mm, slightly smaller than the size of an APS-C film frame, or about 40% of the area of a full-frame sensor. Other sensor sizes found in DSLRs include the Four Thirds System sensor at 26% of full frame, APS-H sensors (used, for example, in the Canon EOS-1D Mark III) at around 61% of full frame, and the original Foveon X3 sensor at 33% of full frame (although Foveon sensors since 2013 have been APS-C sized). Leica offers an &quot;S-System&quot; DSLR with a 30×45 mm array containing 37 million pixels. This sensor is 56% larger than a full-frame sensor.

The resolution of DSLR sensors is typically measured in megapixels. More expensive cameras and cameras with larger sensors tend to have higher megapixel ratings. A larger megapixel rating does not mean higher quality. Low light sensitivity is a good example of this. When comparing two sensors of the same size, for example, two APS-C sensors one 12.1 MP and one 18 MP, the one with the lower megapixel rating will usually perform better in low light. This is because the size of the individual pixels is larger, and more light is landing on each pixel, compared with the sensor with more megapixels. This is not always the case, because newer cameras that have higher megapixels also have better noise reduction software, and higher ISO settings to make up for the loss of light per pixel due to higher pixel density.


=== Depth-of-field control ===
The lenses typically used on DSLRs have a wider range of apertures available to them, ranging from as large as 0.9 to about 32. Lenses for smaller sensor cameras rarely have true available aperture sizes much larger than 2.8 or much smaller than 5.6.

To help extend the exposure range, some smaller sensor cameras will also incorporate an ND filter pack into the aperture mechanism.

The apertures that smaller sensor cameras have available give much more depth of field than equivalent angles of view on a DSLR. For example, a 6  mm lens on a 2/3″ sensor digicam has a field of view similar to a 24 mm lens on a 35 mm camera. At an aperture of 2.8, the smaller sensor camera (assuming a crop factor of 4) has a similar depth of field to that 35 mm camera set to 11.

=== Wider angle of view ===

The angle of view of a lens depends upon its focal length and the camera&#x27;s image sensor size; a sensor smaller than 35 mm film format (36×24 mm frame) gives a narrower angle of view for a lens of a given focal length than a camera equipped with a full-frame (35  mm) sensor. As of 2017, only a few current DSLRs have full-frame sensors, including the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, EOS 5D Mark IV, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS 6D Mark II; Nikon&#x27;s D5, D610, D750, D850, and Df; and the Pentax K-1. The scarcity of full-frame DSLRs is partly a result of the cost of such large sensors. Medium format size sensors, such as those used in the Mamiya ZD among others, are even larger than full-frame (35 mm) sensors, and capable of even greater resolution, and are correspondingly more expensive.

The impact of sensor size on the field of view is referred to as the &quot;crop factor&quot; or &quot;focal length multiplier&quot;, which is a factor by which a lens focal length can be multiplied to give the full-frame-equivalent focal length for a lens. Typical APS-C sensors have crop factors of 1.5 to 1.7, so a lens with a focal length of 50 mm will give a field of view equal to that of a 75 mm to 85 mm lens on a 35 mm camera. The smaller sensors of Four Thirds System cameras have a crop factor of 2.0.

While the crop factor of APS-C cameras effectively &quot;narrows&quot; the angle of view of long-focus (telephoto) lenses, making it easier to take close-up images of distant objects, &quot;wide&quot;-angle lenses suffer a reduction in their angle of view by the same factor.

DSLRs with &quot;crop&quot; sensor size have slightly more depth-of-field than cameras with 35 mm sized sensors for a given angle of view. The amount of added depth of field for a given focal length can be roughly calculated by multiplying the depth of field by the crop factor. Shallower depth of field is often preferred by professionals for portrait work and to isolate a subject from its background.

=== Unusual features ===
On July 13, 2007, FujiFilm announced the FinePix IS Pro, which uses Nikon F-mount lenses. This camera, in addition to having live preview, has the ability to record in the infrared and ultraviolet spectra of light.

In August 2010 Sony released series of DSLRs allowing 3D photography. It was accomplished by sweeping the camera horizontally or vertically in Sweep Panorama 3D mode. The picture could be saved as ultra-wide panoramic image or as 16:9 3D photography to be viewed on BRAVIA 3D television set.

==Comparison with other digital cameras==
The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera&#x27;s sensor is also the image that is seen through the viewfinder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the viewfinder – hence the name &quot;single-lens reflex&quot;. While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera&#x27;s screen to be used as an electronic viewfinder. However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.

Compared with some low-cost cameras that provide an optical viewfinder that uses a small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design has the advantage of being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display – for them, this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide &quot;live preview&quot; (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder.

===Optical view image and digitally created image===
The larger, advanced digital cameras offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) in addition to the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has the lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being &quot;updated&quot; at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the &quot;resolution&quot; of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and &quot;micro-photography&quot; (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.

=== Performance differences ===

DSLR cameras often have image sensors of much larger size and often higher quality, offering lower noise, which is useful in low light. Although mirrorless digital cameras with APS-C and full frame sensors exist, most full frame and medium format sized image sensors are still seen in DSLR designs.

For a long time, DSLRs offered faster and more responsive performance, with less shutter lag, faster autofocus systems, and higher frame rates. Around 2016–17, some mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects. The downside of these cameras being that they do not have an optical viewfinder, making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial. Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture (time measured from pressing the shutter release to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium) than DSLR cameras, but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in-camera processing chips. Still, compact digital cameras are not suited for action, wildlife, sports, and other photography requiring a high burst rate (frames per second).

Simple point-and-shoot cameras rely almost exclusively on their built-in automation and machine intelligence for capturing images under a variety of situations and offer no manual control over their functions, a trait that makes them unsuitable for use by professionals, enthusiasts, and proficient consumers (also known as &quot;prosumers&quot;). Bridge cameras provide some degree of manual control over the camera&#x27;s shooting modes, and some even have hot shoes and the option to attach lens accessories such as filters and secondary converters. DSLRs typically provide the photographer with full control over all the important parameters of photography and have the option to attach additional accessories using the hot shoe. including hot shoe-mounted flash units, battery grips for additional power and hand positions, external light meters, and remote controls. DSLRs typically also have fully automatic shooting modes.

DSLRs have a larger focal length for the same field of view, which allows the creative use of depth of field effects. However, small digital cameras can focus better on closer objects than typical DSLR lenses.

The sensors used in current DSLRs — &quot;full-frame&quot; which is the same size as 35mm film, APS-C, and Four Thirds System — are much larger than most digital cameras. Entry-level compact cameras typically use sensors known as 1/2.3″, which is 3% the size of a full-frame sensor. There are fixed-lens cameras — such as bridge cameras, premium compact cameras, or high-end point-and-shoot cameras — that offer sensors larger than 1/2.3″, but many still fall short of the larger sizes widely found in DSLRs. Examples include the Sigma DP1, which uses a Foveon X3 sensor; the Leica X1; the Canon PowerShot G1 X, which uses a 1.5″ (18.7×14 mm) sensor that is slightly larger than the Four Thirds standard and is 30% of a full-frame sensor; the Nikon Coolpix A, which uses an APS-C sensor of the same size as those found in the company&#x27;s DX-format DSLRs; and two models from Sony, the RX100 with a 1″-type (13.2×8.8 mm) sensor with about half the area of Four Thirds and the full-frame Sony RX1. These premium compacts are often comparable to entry-level DSLRs in price, with a smaller sensor being a tradeoff for the size and weight savings.


===Fixed or interchangeable lenses===
Unlike DSLRs, most digital cameras lack the option to change the lens. Instead, most compact digital cameras are manufactured with a zoom lens that covers the most commonly used fields of view. Having fixed lenses, they are limited to the focal lengths they are manufactured with, except for what is available from attachments. Manufacturers have attempted (with increasing success) to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of focal length on models known as superzooms, some of which offer far longer focal lengths than readily available DSLR lenses.

There are now available perspective-correcting (PC) lenses for DSLR cameras, providing some of the attributes of view cameras. Nikon introduced the first fully manual PC lens in 1961. Recently, however, some manufacturers have introduced advanced lenses that shift and tilt and are operated with automatic aperture control.

However, since the introduction of the Micro Four Thirds system by Olympus and Panasonic in late 2008, mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are now widely available. Hence, the option to change lenses is no longer unique to DSLRs. Cameras for the micro four-thirds system are designed with the option of a replaceable lens, and lenses that conform to this proprietary specification are accepted. Cameras for this system have the same sensor size as the Four-Thirds System but do not have the mirror and pentaprism to reduce the distance between the lens and sensor.

Panasonic released the first Micro Four Thirds camera, the Lumix DMC-G1. Several manufacturers have announced lenses for the new Micro Four Thirds mount. In contrast, older Four-Thirds lenses can be mounted with an adapter (a mechanical spacer with front and rear electrical connectors and its own internal firmware). A similar mirror-less interchangeable lens camera with an APS-C-sized sensor was announced in January 2010: the Samsung NX10. On 21 September 2011, Nikon announced with the Nikon 1 a series of high-speed MILCs. A handful of rangefinder cameras also support interchangeable lenses. Six digital rangefinders exist: the Epson R-D1 (APS-C-sized sensor), the Leica M8 (APS-H-sized sensor), both smaller than 35  mm film rangefinder cameras, and the Leica M9, M9-P, M Monochrom and M (Typ 240) (all full-frame cameras, with the Monochrom shooting exclusively in black-and-white).

In common with other interchangeable lens designs, DSLRs must contend with potential sensor contamination by dust particles when the lens is changed (though recent dust reduction systems alleviate this). Digital cameras with fixed lenses are not usually subject to dust from outside the camera settling on the sensor.

DSLRs generally have more significant cost, size, and weight. They also have louder operation, due to the SLR mirror mechanism. Sony&#x27;s fixed mirror design manages to avoid this problem. However, that design has the disadvantage that the mirror diverts some of the light received from the lens, and thus, the image sensor receives about 30% less light compared with other DSLR designs.

<text>Jouy-le-Moutier () is a commune in the Val-d&#x27;Oise department, in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris, in the &quot;new town&quot; of Cergy-Pontoise, created in the 1960s.

==History==
The name &quot;Jouy-le-Moutier&quot; has only been in use since the 13th century. Two charters by Charlemagne to the bishop of Paris, Eschenradus gave the chapter of Notre Dame de Paris the possession of the church of Andrésy. When the parish of Jouy was created the chapter of Andrésy became its owner. There is no known nomination at the parish of Jouy before 1186.

In 1250 the parish of Vauréal was created from part of the parish of Jouy. Once again it was the chapter of Notre Dame de Paris who chose the first vicar of Jouy. Two letters dated 2 April 1250 from Renaud de Corbeil, bishop of Paris, authorised the parish of Jouy-le-Moutier to build a baptismal church.

The monks of Saint Martin-des-Champs owned in Jouy land and a hostel. The Cistercians of Notre-Dame-du-Val (&quot;near L&#x27;Isle-Adam&quot;) were also owners of land as early as the 13th century. The rich Benedictines of the abbey of Saint Martin-des-Champs built in the 12th near the Fontaine à Jouy a building called &quot;La Maison des Moines&quot; which was used as a cellar. Wine growers paid their taxes in wine. The main agriculture of Jouy was wine as well as fruit growing.

At the beginning of the 20th century the village saw the arrival of the railway. A viaduct crossing the &quot;Rue de la Vallée&quot; was built in 1912 carrying the CGB line from Maurecourt to Pontoise following the River Oise valley.

In 1978 the village saw the construction of a thousand new dwellings on the plateau in relation to the creation of the new town of Cergy-Pontoise. The population grew from 1,200 to 10,000 in less than 5 years. Today most administrative duties are still performed in the village&#x27;s town hall.

==Sites of interest==

===Église Notre-Dame===
Built in the 12th and 16th centuries and is regarded a chef d&#x27;œeuvre of architecture. In the 1930s both of the tower&#x27;s clocks were replaced by a metallic clock placed on the western corner of the tower.

===Théâtre Saint Vincent===

The Théâtre Saint-Vincent was built in 1811 and restored by les Beaux Arts de Paris in 1992 and has 120 seats. This superb Italian &quot;baroque&quot; has its walls covered in paintings highly colourful, an old balcony and oak flooring. The theatre was partially destroyed by a fire in 1866. It is used for many occasions including café-théatre and musical nights, balls and weddings.

===Le Pont de Neuville===
In the early 20th century was built a suspension bridge between Neuville and Jouy. This bridge replaced the ferry service between the communes. At the dawn of the war a new bridge was built to replace the dilapidated suspension bridge, it was dynamited a few months after its inauguration when the war broke off. A new bridge identical to the previous one was built in 1974.

<doc id="1181115" wikidata="Q8016827" url="?curid=1181115" title="William Petre">
<text>Sir William Petre (c. 1505 – 1572) (pronounced &quot;Peter&quot;) was Secretary of State to three successive Tudor monarchs, namely Kings Henry VIII, Edward VI and Queen Mary I. He also deputised for the Secretary of State to Elizabeth I.

Educated as a lawyer at the University of Oxford, he became a public servant, probably through the influence of the Boleyn family, one of whom, George Boleyn, he had tutored at Oxford and another of whom was Queen Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII. He rose rapidly in the royal service and was knighted in 1543.

Sir William Petre was adept at side-stepping the great religious controversies of the day; in January 1544 he was appointed Secretary of State. He navigated the ship of state through the rest of Henry&#x27;s troubled reign, managing a smooth succession in 1547. He held high office throughout the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I until, owing to ill health he retired a rich man to his manor of Ingatestone, in Essex, where he had built Ingatestone Hall. His son was John Petre, 1st Baron Petre of Writtle, raised to the peerage in 1603. The later Barons Petre have mostly been Roman Catholics.

The musician William Byrd wrote a Pavan and a Galliard for Sir William Petre, which were published as part of his &quot;Parthenia&quot;.

==Origins==
Born in about 1505 or 1506, Petre was the eldest son of John Petre of Tor Newton in the parish of Torbryan, Devon, by his wife Alice Colling, daughter of John Colling of Woodland, Devon. The Petre family had been established at Tor Newton from at least the reign of King Richard II (1377–1399). John Petre was by trade a tanner and both of his grandfathers were s (small landowners). His brothers included:
*John Petre (died 1571), Customer of the ports of Dartmouth and Exeter in Devon and MP for Dartmouth in 1554.
*Richard Petre, Archdeacon of Buckingham.
*Robert Petre, an auditor of the Exchequer, whose monument survives in Ingatestone Church, Essex. He received a grant of arms in 1573.

==Education==
In 1519 Petre matriculated at the University of Oxford as a law student. He is claimed as a member of Exeter College, of which he was later a benefactor, but there is no evidence of him there as an undergraduate. In 1523 he became a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, of which he was law bursar in 1528/9. On 2 July 1526 he graduated Bachelor of both laws, and in 1527 and 1528 practised as a lawyer in Oxford.

==Political life==
Petre&#x27;s career is strikingly similar to those of other statesmen of his time, such as William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, John Mason, and Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich, who, &#x27;sprung from the willow rather than the oak&#x27;, and served with equal fidelity Kings Henry and Edward, and Queens Mary and Elizabeth, surviving all contemporary political and religious storms. Among mid-Tudor privy councillors, Petre is unique in his unbroken service; he alone escaped execution, imprisonment in the Tower, house arrest, disgrace, fine, exile, or enforced retirement. As a diplomat, his manner was &#x27;smooth, reserved, resolved, yet obliging&#x27;. At Boulogne in 1550, Chatillion said of Petre &quot;Ah, we had gained the last two hundred thousand crowns without hostages, had it not been for that man who said nothing&quot;.

In his later years, he was said to be a Catholic, a creed to which his descendants have consistently adhered. Nevertheless, his piety was not uncompromising, and did not stand in the way of his temporal advancement. Though he was less rapacious than his colleagues in profiting by the fall of Somerset, Petre acquired enormous property by the dissolution of the monasteries; in Devonshire alone he is said to have secured ; but his principal seat was at Ingatestone which he received on the dissolution of the abbey of St. Mary&#x27;s Barking.

Though so occupied in politics, he seems to have been a man with wider interests; a considerable portion of his wealth was spent on charitable objects; he founded almshouses at Ingatestone, and designed scholarships for All Souls College, Oxford, but his chief benefactions were to Exeter College, Oxford, and entitle him to be considered its second founder. In other ways, Petre was a patron of learning; his correspondence with English envoys abroad contains frequent requests for rare books. He was himself governor of Chelmsford Grammar School, and Ascham benefited by his favour, which he is said to have requited by dedicating to Petre his &quot;Osorius de Nobilitate Christiana&quot;. A mass of Petre&#x27;s correspondence has been summarised in the &#x27;Calendars of State Papers&#x27;, and many of the originals are in the Cottonian, Harleian, and Additional Manuscripts in the British Museum; his transcript of the notes for Edward VI&#x27;s will is in the Inner Temple Library.

William was educated at the great West Country college of Exeter, at Oxford, arriving there in 1520 when he was about 14 (the usual age at that time), from whence he was elected Fellow of All Souls in 1523 where he graduated Bachelor of Civil and Canon Law on 2 July 1526 (both colleges were generously endowed by him later). Proficient both in Roman (administrative) and ecclesiastical law, in about 1527, he became Principal of Peckwater&#x27;s Inn or Vine Hall, and tutor to George Boleyn (son of the Earl of Wiltshire and afterwards Viscount Rochford). It was no doubt through the influence of Boleyn&#x27;s sister Anne that Petre came to the notice of Thomas Cromwell (she sent him presents, and promised him any pleasure it was in her power to give) and was introduced at court and selected for government service. He was sent abroad and resided on the continent, chiefly in France, for more than four years. On his return, he was appointed a Clerk in Chancery and All Souls made him Doctor of Civil Law on 17 February 1532.

In 1534, William and Edmund Walsingham examined Anne Husee on the charge of addressing Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary as Princess when Anne had stayed with her at Hunsdon, and whether she thought her the lawful daughter of the king. Anne Husee, knowing her head to be in danger if she continued to support Mary, took the more prudent way and besought pardon. &#x27;She most humbly beseecheth his Highness of mercy and forgiveness, as One that is repentant for that she hath so offended and purposeth never hereafter to fall in to semblable danger, – signed Anne Husee, countersigned Edmund Walsyngham. Per me Gulielmum Petre&#x27;.

He was only about thirty when he was already in high favour with Cranmer and Cromwell, who spoke in November 1535 of making Petre dean of arches, there &#x27;being no man more fit for it&#x27;.

On 13 January 1536, he was appointed deputy or proctor for Cromwell in his capacity as Vicar-General and appointed Visitor of the greater monasteries in Kent and other southern counties, being especially active in the West Country. In the same year, he was made Master in Chancery, was placed on a commission to receive and examine all bulls and briefs from Rome, and granted the prebend of Langford Ecclesia in Lincoln Cathedral, which he resigned the following year. On 16 June 1536, Petre appeared in Convocation and made a novel claim to preside over its deliberations, on the ground that the King was supreme head of the church, Cromwell was the King&#x27;s vicegerent, and he was Cromwell&#x27;s deputy. After some discussion, his claim was allowed. In 1537 he was employed to examine Robert Aske and other prisoners taken in the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire rebellions.

Soon he was actively visiting and aiding in the suppression of the smaller monasteries; he was one of the most zealous of the visitors. Among the twenty monasteries he visited and procured the surrender of in 1538 were, perhaps, St. Leonard&#x27;s, Thoby and Blackmore. In the first three months of 1539, thirteen more fell before him; he being instrumental in the almost total extirpation of the Gilbertines, the only religious order of English origin. A few years later, he was Visitor of the greater monasteries in Kent and the South of England.

===Secretary of State to Henry VIII===
In 1539, Petre was one of those appointed to prepare a bill for the enactment of &#x27;The Six Articles&#x27;, and in the following year was on the commission that declared the nullity of Henry&#x27;s marriage with Anne of Cleves. Early in 1543, he was knighted, appointed Secretary of State in Wriothesley&#x27;s place and placed on various commissions to inquire into causes of supposed heresy. In 1544, Henry made William a Privy Councillor, and on 9 July 1544, one of his two Principal Secretaries selected to assist Queen Katherine in carrying on the Regency in the small &#x27;Regency Council&#x27; during Henry&#x27;s absence, and to raise supplies for the King&#x27;s expedition to Boulogne. In 1545, he was sent abroad as ambassador to the great Emperor Charles V, but at the end of the year was summoned back to the Privy Council.

Though much occupied with public business, this astute politician found time and many opportunities to get and lay by great gain for himself. As one of the Visitors of the monasteries, he knew better than many people what properties were worth acquiring. He paid the king some £849 12s 6d (approximately £330,000 today) for the property known as &quot;Ginge Abbes&quot; at Ingatestone, even though the King was trying to raise money and this was a &quot;fair&quot; price it is probably true Sir William got a bargain. Ingatestone, which had previously belonged to Barking Abbey, must have been selected as being a particularly fertile and well-cultivated district at that period, within an easy ride of London, and with the comfortable house of the Abbess&#x27;s steward, with its fish-ponds and park, easily turned into an excellent country residence for the busy statesman. Here, at Ingatestone Hall, Sir William Petre established himself and his family, and many of his letters are dated from this place.

However, there is some evidence of an institutionalised system of bribery and corruption. Those in public office were expected to charge for favours and salaries were accordingly set very low. Accounts show that by 1540, William was receiving £180 per year in annuities from religious houses he had visited (approximately £70,000 today). If it seems strange that abbeys should give annuities to an individual charged with abolishing them, they were probably bribes either to delay the procedure or to facilitate a pension for the retiring Abbot. William received money from about twenty monasteries.

===Secretary of State to Edward VI===
When Henry VIII died in 1547 William was appointed an assistant executor to his will. This gave him much hold over the Protestant and youthful sovereign, Edward VI, and his power, importance and activity rapidly increased. In August 1547, he was entrusted with the Great Seal for use in all ecclesiastical affairs.

In 1547 he was first elected as knight of the shire (MP) for Essex. He was returned for Essex a further eight times in 1553 (twice), 1554 (twice), 1555, 1558, 1559 and 1563. He may have previously sat for Downton in 1536.

In 1549, he served on commissions to visit the University of Oxford inquiring into heresies, to examine the charges against Lord Seymour of Sudeley, and to try the sometime Bishop of London Bonner. He did not take part in Bonner&#x27;s trial after the first day, and it was rumoured that he &#x27;was turning about to another party&#x27;. On 6 October 1549, he was sent by Somerset to the council to demand the reason of their coming together, though at first a supporter of the Protector Somerset. Finding them the stronger party he deserted Somerset just before his fall, remaining to sign the council&#x27;s letter to the lord mayor denouncing the protector; four days later he also signed the proclamation against Somerset.

By the 1550s, he was very prosperous. Not only was he Secretary of State but he also had many other sinecures such as warden of Bishop of Winchester&#x27;s lands. He enjoyed many rewards such as free board and lodging at court. In February 1550, he was sent to Boulogne to negotiate the terms of peace with France, and in the following May exchanged ratifications of it at Amiens. William Petre is described as smooth and obliging in manner, yet reserved and resolved, and not given to many words. In the same year, he was treasurer of First Fruits and Tenths and one of the commissioners to examine the Bishop of Winchester Gardiner; he was also sent to New Hall, Essex, to request Princess Mary to come to court or change her residence. William also wrote in terms of friendship to William Cecil in 1551, from Ingatestone, regretting to hear that Cecil is ill, thanking him for a book he had sent, and saying his little ones when they are able shall send him some proof of their progress; and wrote again later to congratulate Cecil on his recovery.

In 1551, Sir William served with Lord Rich of Leigh&#x27;s Priory as the council&#x27;s agent in warning Princess Mary not to have the Mass celebrated at New Hall, Boreham and Copped Hall, near Waltham Abbey, her Essex mansions. September 1551 found him laid up at Ingatestone Hall, and unable to travel to Court. He still had many affairs on hand, amongst them a very trivial complaint from the Countess of Southampton, which Sir William forwarded to William Cecil, recommending that her suit be allowed and attended to &#x27;Jane, Countess of Southampton, complains that Hierom Colas, French teacher to her children, has left her service, and begs he may be compelled to return&#x27;. In October, he was appointed to confer with the German ambassadors on the proposed Protestant alliance; and in December, he was on a commission for calling in the king&#x27;s debts.

===Secretary of State to Mary I===
As the young Edward VI&#x27;s health failed, it was necessary to determine what should be done on his death, and a memorial was drawn up and signed by Sir William Petre in May 1553, under the direction of the King and the Privy Council, limiting the succession, in the interest of Lady Jane Grey, to Protestants. Two months later Edward VI was dead and Mary had a powerful party behind her, On 20 July, he, like the majority of the council, declared for Mary, the memorial in Sir William&#x27;s handwriting was laid on the shelf. He remained in London during the next few days transacting secretarial business, but his wife joined Mary and entered London with her.

Petre had been identified with the council&#x27;s most obnoxious proceedings towards Mary, and his position was at first insecure. He resumed attendance at the council on 12 August, but in September, it was rumoured that he was out of office. He was however, installed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter on 26 September when he was directed by the Queen to expunge the new rules formulated during the late reign. He further ingratiated himself with Mary by his zeal in tracing the accomplices of Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion and by his advocacy of the Spanish marriage. Petre now devoted himself exclusively to his official duties; he rarely missed attendance at the council and was frequently employed to consult with foreign ambassadors. He acquiesced in the restoration of the old religion, and took a prominent part in the reception of Pole and ceremonies connected with the absolution of England from the guilt of heresy.

As Petre had acquiesced in the Reformation under Henry VIII, so now he acquiesced in the re-establishment of the Pope&#x27;s authority and the restoration of the Roman form of service, and was one of the foremost at Cardinal Pole&#x27;s reception when he came on a mission from the Pope. With his vast Church property, it behoved Sir William to stand well with the new religious authorities; Cardinal Pole had come with instructions not to be too particular about the restoration of abbey lands. Mary approved the scheme drawn up by him. With great dexterity, William succeeded in obtaining a &#x27;Bull of Confirmation&#x27; confirming him in possession of the lands he had derived from the suppression of the monasteries. Pope Paul IV granted this on 27 November 1555. This is believed to be a unique document. Sir William was also absolved from the Interdict of Excommunication placed upon Henry VIII. He was allowed to retain his lands, but was exhorted to endow a charity foundation and to provide pensions for the needy inhabitants of Ingatestone, who had been deprived of their accustomed doles from the monasteries by the wholesale dissolution and destruction that had taken place, so largely by the aid of William Petre himself. This bull is a lengthy document, and enumerates all the Church lands Sir William Petre had acquired, and the prices he had paid for them.

It was at Ingatestone Hall, where Queen Mary stopped in her journey to London after her accession, that Petre was sworn her Secretary; and here also that William Cecil offered his obedience, kissed her hand, but lost his appointment as Secretary, which he had shared with his older colleague. Petre was one of the councillors deputed to question Princess Elizabeth in the Tower on Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion (during which Petre raised a small force for the Queen). He also helped to negotiate Mary&#x27;s marriage. Mary gave him a diamond ring.

The move was a wise one for a man so heavily weighted with Church property, and his adroitness quickly enabled him to be as indispensable to Mary as he had been to her father and brother. He warmly advocated the Spanish marriage with Philip, and was soon freely consulted by Bishop Gardiner on matters of State policy. He took an active part in discovering the persons implicated in Sir Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s rising which took place early in 1554 with the object of preventing Mary&#x27;s marriage and of putting Elizabeth on the throne. After the capture of Wyatt, Sir John Bourne writes from the Tower to tell Secretary Petre that he has been labouring to make Sir Thomas Wyatt confess that the Lady Elizabeth and her servant Sir William St. Loo, were implicated in the matter; but Sir Thomas Wyatt confessed nothing, and Elizabeth, though imprisoned for a time, was spared. In July 1554, Philip landed in England and married Mary. The following year Petre attended at Court and wrote thence to the Earl of Devonshire, in July, that the Queen&#x27;s hour was daily expected.

By 1556, his income was £3,353 with very modest personal expenses; he wrote to Nicholas Wotton, Dean of Canterbury, desiring Wootton to succeed him as Secretary of State, being himself so out of health.

It was on his advice that Mary in 1557 forbade the landing of the Pope&#x27;s messenger sent to confer legatine power on William Peto instead of Pole; he was responsible for receiving the first Russian ambassador to England. However, by the end of the year, owing to declining health, he ceased to be Secretary.

Together with Sir William Garrard and Simon Lowe, he was an executor of the will of Maurice Griffith, Bishop of Rochester, the three having also been mourners at his funeral. In consequence of this, these three played a part as the initial trustees in the founding of Friars School, Bangor.

===Reign of Elizabeth I===
In the first decade after the &#x27;Act of Settlement&#x27;, 1559, there was a broad toleration of Catholics and they maintained their positions but in ever decreasing numbers.

Once again, to save his place, Sir William had to change his religion, as did so many others; but he was becoming old – he had all the property he could desire, his health was failing, and politics no longer attracted him as in his younger days. On Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, Petre was one of those charged to transact all business before the queen&#x27;s coronation, and was still employed on various state affairs, but his attendances at the council became less frequent. In March 1559, he wrote to William Cecil that he would attend him at the Court if necessary, but wishes to be excused because of the disease of his leg; he did however still deputise for Secretary Cecil during the summer of 1560, when Cecil was in Scotland. However, he still had many years of official life before him. He resided much at Ingatestone Hall in those later days, and he can be found writing from there in 1561 about the Portuguese restrictions on English merchants in the Indies.

One of Petre&#x27;s last public duties was to take charge of Lady Katherine Grey at Ingatestone Hall in 1564–1566. Katherine, a younger sister of the ill-fated Lady Jane, had married the Earl of Hertford without Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s consent. Elizabeth was furious. The care of her seems to have been the last public charge undertaken by William Petre: from 1566 he practically retired and devoted himself to his charitable foundations. He wrote again to Cecil that he was too ill to go abroad, though recovered of his fever, and wished to retire &quot;to my poore house at Ingatestone&quot;, where he thinks the open air would do him good.

===Retirement===
Thomas Larke in a Survey of the estate in 1566 describes the circumstances of acquiring Ingatestone:

Unlike both the Treshams of Rushton and the Fitzwilliams of Milton, the Petres had no difficulty in adjusting the scale of their entertainment and hospitality to the family&#x27;s reduced income after Sir William&#x27;s retirement from Court. The Petres were safely removed from both the temptations and the gains of the Court, and in every respect, the nature of their estates placed them ideally for profitable survival throughout the period under review. The personality of the family was well suited to taking full advantage of the opportunities open to them.

In his later years, Sir William was said to be Roman Catholic, albeit not involved in the many plots that were laid against Elizabeth, and this is a creed to which his descendants have consistently adhered. His piety was not uncompromising, and did not stand in the way of his temporal advancement. The hall at Ingatestone, which he built there, still stands almost unimpaired, whilst he is buried with his second wife in a chapel adjoining the chancel of St. Edmund and St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Ingatestone.

==Bequests==
A considerable portion of Petre&#x27;s wealth was spent on charitable objects; he founded almshouses at Ingatestone, and endowed scholarships for All Souls&#x27; College, Oxford. He was one of the first Governors of King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford. Ascham benefited favour by his favour, which he is said to have requited by dedicating to Petre his &#x27;Osorius de Nobilitate Christiana&#x27;.

His chief benefactions were to Exeter College, Oxford (whose rowing eights bear his name to this day), and entitle him to be considered its founder; he rewrote its statutes so its membership was increased. That he retained a warm affection for the college that had given him his early education is evident from the liberal gifts he made. In 1566 he founded seven Scholarships or Fellowships, called the Petrean Fellowships, and the next year founded another to be nominated by him or his heirs from the counties of Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Oxford, Essex, and other counties within the kingdom of England where he had lands and inheritance. For the maintenance of these, he gave four Oxfordshire rectories (which had cost him £1,376) and four parishes (Kidlington, Merton, South Newington and Yarnton) a yearly value of £91 annually. In his will gave a further sum of £40 for the same purpose, to which Lady Petre his widow, and his son and heir John each added another £40. He was a great collector of books, and presented many to Exeter College library. He also obtained for the college new and beneficial Statutes from the Bishop of Exeter, and a Charter from the Queen that the college might be a body politic and corporate. On his portrait, which hangs in Exeter College Hall, is this inscription &quot;Octo socios cum terries addidit AD 1566 et multos Libros Bibliothecae contulit&quot;. Probably his liberality to Exeter suggested to his daughter Dorothy and her husband, Nicholas Wadham, the founding of the new college of Wadham at Oxford.

==Marriages and issue==
Petre married twice:

===First marriage===
Firstly, in about 1533, he married Gertrude Tyrrell (died 28 May 1541), with whom he had two daughters:
*Dorothy Petre (1534–1618) married Nicholas Wadham (died 1609), founders of Wadham College, Oxford
*Elizabeth Petre, god-daughter of Jane Wriothesley wife of Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, who married firstly John Gostwick of Willington, Bedfordshire. They were the grandparents of Sir Edward Gostwick, 2nd Baronet. Elizabeth married secondly Edward Radclyffe, 6th Earl of Sussex as his first wife.

===Second marriage===
Petre married secondly, by March 1542, Anne Browne (c.1509 – 10 March 1582), widow of John Tyrrell (died 1540), with whom he had three sons and two daughters:
*John Petre, 1st Baron Petre (1549–1613), who 1570 married Mary Waldegrave (died 2 August 1604).
*Two sons who died young.
*Katherine Petre, who married John Talbot of Grafton, Worcestershire.
*Thomasine Petre, who married Lodovick Greville, son of Sir Edward Greville of Milcote; by him she had a son Sir Edward Greville.

== Notable descendants ==
Mildred Mary Petre known as Mrs Victor Bruce (1895–1990) record-breaking racing motorist, speedboat racer and aviator in the 1920s and 1930s.

<text>Kenneth David Kirkland (September 28, 1955 – November 12, 1998) was an American pianist and keyboardist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Brooklyn, New York, United States, Kirkland was six when he first sat down at a piano keyboard. After years of Catholic schooling, Kirkland enrolled at the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied classical piano performance, classical theory and composition.

===Career===
Kirkland&#x27;s first professional work came with Polish fusion violinist Michal Urbaniak, touring throughout Europe with his group in 1977. Coincidentally, his next high-profile gig was with another Eastern European jazz émigré, Miroslav Vitous. Kirkland is featured on Vitous&#x27; ECM recordings &quot;First Meeting&quot; and &quot;Miroslav Vitous Group&quot;.

In 1980, while Kirkland was on tour in Japan with Terumasa Hino, he met Wynton Marsalis, which began his long association with both Wynton and his older brother Branford. On Wynton’s self-titled debut album, Kirkland shared the piano duties with one of his musical influences, Herbie Hancock, but was the sole pianist on Marsalis&#x27;s subsequent releases &quot;Think of One&quot;, &quot;Hot House Flowers&quot; and &quot;Black Codes (From the Underground)&quot;.

In 1985 Kirkland (alongside Branford Marsalis) joined the Blue Turtles, the jazz-pop studio-and-touring backing band put together by Sting to perform the latter&#x27;s post-Police solo work and which can be heard on his first two solo releases &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot; and &quot;Bring on the Night&quot;. Although the Blue Turtles would be a relatively short-lived outfit (performing two or three years of high-profile touring before Sting opted to continue with more traditional pop lineups), Kirkland would maintain his musical relationship with Sting afterwards, performing various piano and keyboard parts on subsequent studio albums.

Following his time in the Wynton Marsalis band, Kirkland&#x27;s main musical collaborator would be Branford Marsalis, whose quartet he joined in 1986 as a founder member. He is also featured on Branford’s funk band album &quot;Buckshot Lefonque&quot;. When Branford Marsalis assumed the high-visibility role of bandleader for NBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, Kirkland became the band&#x27;s pianist.

In 1991, he released his debut as a leader, &quot;Kenny Kirkland&quot;, on GRP Records. &quot;Thunder And Rainbows&quot; (1991, Sunnyside Records), by &quot;Jazz from Keystone&quot;, is a trio album with Kirkland, Charles Fambrough, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts.

Leading up to and on June 1–3, 1998, Kirkland worked with long-time associate &quot;Tain&quot; Watts on the drummer&#x27;s debut recording &quot;Citizen Tain&quot;. According to producer Delfeayo Marsalis, &quot;He was clearly not in good shape.&quot; When asked about going to the doctor, Kirkland responded, &quot;After the session. If I go now, they&#x27;ll make me check into a hospital.&quot; On June 4, doctors told Kirkland he had a congestive heart condition that required an operation. He attributed his poor health to twenty years of touring without adequate vacations and exercise, and deemed his chances of surviving any surgery 50/50 or less. Fearful of having a cardiac procedure, Kirkland accepted his fate and was soon on the road with Branford Marsalis again. On November 7, 1998, Kirkland attended Marsalis&#x27;s wedding in New Rochelle, New York. Kirkland was found dead in his Queens apartment on Friday, November 13, 1998.

The official doctor&#x27;s report listed his death as due to congestive heart failure. He was survived by his mother, brother and two sisters.

===Philosophy===
In a video interview with Sting published on Aug 29, 2020 as part of the Doctone Project, Sting relates about Kirkland’s playing philosophy as follows: “I learned a lot from him—that way of approaching harmony where there are no wrong notes, just the note that you follow with... there are no mistakes in a Kenny Kirkland solo. What you think is wrong momentarily is suddenly put right by a choice, so that philosophy was something I learned at his feet... You can bring that into life, too. We all make mistakes, [but] it’s how we cope with them or how we react next, so that for me is the essence of jazz. You take a risk and you’re rewarded by your subsequent choices.”

<text>John Myers Felder (July 7, 1782 – September 1, 1851) was a United States politician who served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing South Carolina, from 1831 to 1835.

==Biography==
His grandfather was a native of Switzerland, came to South Carolina about 1720, and was killed during the American Revolution while defending his house against an attack by Tories. The grandson was born in the vicinity of Orangeburg, South Carolina. He graduated from Yale University in 1804, a roommate and close friend of John Caldwell Calhoun.

=== Early career ===
After graduation, he studied at Litchfield Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1808. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1812.

=== Congress ===
In 1830, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served in Congress for four years, first as a Jacksonian and from 1833 as a Nullifier.

=== Later career and death ===
After declining renomination in 1834, he went back to South Carolina, where the voters of Orangeburg returned him to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1840. He served there until his death on September 1, 1851.

Felder retired from the legal profession in 1830, and became a prosperous mill owner and planter. He never married and had no children, although his sister Eliza has many descendants.

<text>Thomas Beach VC (24 January 1824 – 24 August 1864) was a British Army soldier and a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Beach suffered from severe alcoholism later in life. He died due to his alcoholism at the age of 40.

==Military service==
Beach joined the British Army at the age of sixteen, being assigned to the 92nd Regiment of Foot (Gordon Highlanders) on 30 April 1840. He was posted to a variety of locations, including the West Indies and the Greek Isles. When the Crimean War broke out in 1854, his regiment was posted to Gibraltar as a garrison force. Beach volunteered to be seconded to another unit which was going to Crimea, and he was placed with the 55th Regiment of Foot.

It was in Crimea that he conducted himself in a manner that would later result in him being awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in the face of the enemy. His medal citation reads:
Although the official citation does not specify the exact number of opposing soldiers, Beach held off and fought a total of 5 Russians, with 2 of the opposing side killed.

It was the first Victoria Cross to be awarded to a member of the regiment. Alongside Major Frederick Cockayne Elton, Beach was presented with the VC by General Ferguson on 20 July 1857.

In addition to the Victoria Cross, during his time in the military he was awarded two good conduct medals. However he was also placed 21 times in the regimental defaulters book and was twice tried by court martial. The 1861 census of England, Wales and Scotland placed him living in Perth, Scotland.

==Later life and legacy==
After leaving the army in June 1863 following 23 years of service, including seven and a half years overseas, he became a railway labourer. Less than a year later he had died from the effects of alcohol poisoning in the Dundee Royal Infirmary.

Beach was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave somewhere in the Eastern Necropolis in Dundee. The exact location of the burial is unknown due to the number of mass graves in that area. On 17 May 2003, a bench dedicated to him was placed in Necropolis, alongside a bench devoted to fellow Victoria Cross holder Peter Grant, who is also buried somewhere in the area in a similar grave. On 20 October 2006, a $1.50 stamp was issued in Kiribati commemorating Beach&#x27;s Victoria Cross action. A drawing of it which had previously appeared in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; was used.

His medal is held at the Sheesh Mahal fort in Lahore, Pakistan. It forms part of a collection which was gathered by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala during the 1920s.

<text>Herman Chernoff (born July 1, 1923) is an American applied mathematician, statistician and physicist. He was formerly a professor at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Stanford, and MIT, currently emeritus at Harvard University.

==Early life and education==
Herman Chernoff&#x27;s parents were Pauline and Max Chernoff, Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. He studied at Townsend Harris High School and earned a B.S. in mathematics from the City College of New York in 1943. He attended graduate school at Brown University, earning an M.Sc. in applied mathematics in 1945, and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1948 under the supervision of Abraham Wald.

==Recognition==
Chernoff became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1980. In 1987, he was selected for the Wilks Memorial Award by the American Statistical Association, and in 2012, he was made an inaugural fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

==Personal life==

Herman Chernoff&#x27;s met his future wife, Judith, when they were both graduate students at Brown University in 1945, and married her in 1947. She died at the age of 98 on June 9, 2023. At the time of her death they were believed to be the oldest couple living in Massachusetts.

Chernoff turned 100 on July 1, 2023.

<doc id="1181133" wikidata="Q4921794" url="?curid=1181133" title="Design–build">
<text>Design–build (or design/build, and abbreviated D–B or D/B accordingly), also known as alternative delivery, is a project delivery system used in the construction industry. It is a method to deliver a project in which the design and construction services are contracted by a single entity known as the design–builder or design–build contractor. It can be subdivided into architect-led design–build (ALDB, sometimes known as designer-led design–build) and contractor-led design–build.

In contrast to &quot;design–bid–build&quot; (or &quot;design–tender&quot;), design–build relies on a single point of responsibility contract and is used to minimize risks for the project owner and to reduce the delivery schedule by overlapping the design phase and construction phase of a project.

Design–build also has a single point responsibility. The design-build contractor is responsible for all work on the project, so the client can seek legal remedies for any fault from one party.

The traditional approach for construction projects consists of the appointment of a designer on one side, and the appointment of a contractor on the other side. The design–build procurement route changes the traditional sequence of work. It answers the client&#x27;s wishes for a single point of responsibility in an attempt to reduce risks and overall costs. Although the use of subcontractors to complete more specialized work is common, the design-build contractor remains the primary contact and primary force behind the work. It is now commonly used in many countries and forms of contracts are widely available.

Design–build is sometimes compared to the &quot;master builder&quot; approach, one of the oldest forms of construction procedure. Comparing design–build to the traditional method of procurement, the authors of &quot;Design-build Contracting Handbook&quot; noted that: &quot;from a historical perspective the so-called traditional approach is actually a very recent concept, only being in use approximately 150 years. In contrast, the design–build concept—also known as the &quot;master builder&quot; concept—has been reported as being in use for over four millennia.&quot;

Although the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) takes the position that design–build can be led by a contractor, a designer, a developer or a joint venture, as long as a design–build entity holds a single contract for both design and construction, some architects have suggested that architect-led design–build is a specific approach to design–build.

Design-build plays an important role in pedagogy, both at universities and in independently organised events such as Rural Studio or ArchiCamp.

==Design–build contractor==
The &quot;design–builder&quot; is often a general contractor, but in many cases a project is led by a design professional (architect, engineer, architectural technologist or other professional designers). Some design–build firms employ professionals from both the design and construction sector. Where the design–builder is a general contractor, the designers are typically retained directly by the contractor. Partnership or a joint venture between a design firm and a construction firm may be created on a long-term basis or for one project only.

Until 1979, the AIA American Institute of Architects&#x27; code of ethics and professional conduct prohibited their members from providing construction services. However today many architects in the United States and elsewhere aspire to provide integrated design and construction services, and one approach towards this goal is design–build. The AIA has acknowledged that design–build is becoming one of the main approaches to construction. In 2003, the AIA endorsed &quot;The architect&#x27;s guide to design–build services&quot;, which was written to help their members acting as design–build contractors. This publication gives guidance through the different phases of the process: design services, contracts, management, insurances, and finances.

==Contractor-led design–build projects: the architect&#x27;s role==
On contractor-led design–build projects, management is structured so that the owner works directly with a contractor who, in turn, coordinates subcontractors. Architects contribute to contractor-led design–build projects in one of several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where &quot;A/E&quot; in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

#Architect as employee of contractor: The architect works for the contractor as an in-house employee. The architect still bears professional risk and is likely to have less control than in other contractor-led design–build approaches.
#Architect as a subcontractor: Here, the architect is one of the many subcontractors on the team led by the contractor. The architect bears similar professional risk but still with little control.
#Architect as second party in contractor-led integrated project delivery (IPD): The architect and contractor work together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. The building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. The contractor leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the architect might defer to the contractor. The architect bears the same risk as they do in the traditional approach but has more control in IPD, even if they were to defer to the contractor.

==Architect-led design–build projects==
Architect-led design–build projects are those in which interdisciplinary teams of architects and building trades professionals collaborate in an agile management process, where design strategy and construction expertise are seamlessly integrated, and the architect, as owner-advocate, project-steward and team-leader, ensures high fidelity between project aims and outcomes. In architect-led design–build projects, the architect works directly with the owner (the client), acts as the designer and builder, coordinating a team of consultants, subcontractors and materials suppliers throughout the project lifecycle.

Architects lead design–build projects in several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where &quot;A/E&quot; in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

#Architect as provider of extended services: Contracted to the owner, the architect extends his or her services beyond the design phase, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors on behalf of the owner. The architect bears similar risk but has more control over the project than in the traditional approach or on contractor-led design–build projects.
#Architect as primary party in architect-led integrated project delivery (IPD): Again, as in working together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. Again, the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. This time, the architect leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the contractor might defer to the architect. The architect might bear more risk than they do in the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor, as outlined in their agreement. An alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project, and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor, who enters into further subcontracts with the trades. This is a difference in form, rather than in substance, because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract. It is the &quot;flip side of the coin&quot; of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect.
#Architect as full service leader of design build process: Contracted to the owner, the architect offers full service to the owner, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors, consultants and vendors, and involving them throughout the project, start to finish, from design through construction. The architect&#x27;s role shifts during the project, from designer to site supervisor (effectively taking the role of a general contractor), but monitors the project vision, and is able to call upon subcontractors&#x27; construction expertise throughout. The architect bears the greatest risk but also has more control over the project than in either the traditional approach, or in the contractor-led and other architect-led design–build projects.

==Contracts==
A single set of integrated contracts combining design and construction responsibilities, rather than two discrete contracts for each, acknowledges the interdependence of the architects&#x27; and construction trades&#x27; project responsibilities, and reduces the likelihood of disputes.

==Design–build institutes==
In 1993, the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) was formed. Its membership is composed of design and construction industry professionals as well as project owners. DBIA promotes the value of design–build project delivery and teaches the effective integration of design and construction services to ensure success for owners and design and construction practitioners. The Design-Build Institute of America is an organization that defines, teaches and promotes best practices in design–build.

The Canadian Design-Build Institute (CDBI) describes itself as &quot;The recognized voice of Design-Build practitioners in Canada, promoting and enhancing the proper use of Design-Build method of procurement and contracting&quot;.

===Advocacy===
Not all design–build projects are alike. Here, there is a distinction between design–build projects led by contractors and those led by architects. Architect-led Design Build is a form of &#x27;design–build&#x27; that, according to the DBIA, has been rapidly gaining market share in the United States over the past 15 years. The Design Build Institute of America describes the design–build process as follows:

Taking singular responsibility, the design–build team is accountable for cost, schedule and performance, under a single contract and with reduced administrative paperwork, clients can focus on the project rather than managing disparate contracts. And, by closing warranty gaps, building owners also virtually eliminate litigation claims.

The DBIA&#x27;s 2005 chart shows the uptake of design–build methods in non-residential design and construction in the United States.

Architect-led design–build is sometimes known by the more generic name &quot;designer-led design–build&quot;. Although employed primarily by architects, architectural technologists and other architectural professions, the design–build structure works similarly for interior design projects led by an interior designer who is not an architect, and also for engineering projects where the design–build team is led by a professional structural, civil, mechanical or other engineers. In addition, it is common for the design professional who leads the design–build team to create a separate corporation or similar business entity through which the professional performs the construction and other related non-professional services.

In 2011, design–build continued to gain ground as a significant trend in design and construction.

In March 2011, industry consultants ZweigWhite published &quot;Design-Bid-Build meets the opposition&quot;. In it, they suggest that while Design-Bid-Build &quot;still rules&quot;, the traditional approach is losing favor as &quot;alternative project delivery methods threaten [the] design-bid-build model.&quot; While not referencing the architect-led design–build approach specifically, the article states that D/B already accounts for 27% of projects, according to their 2010 Project Management Survey and goes on to argue that,

The emerging trends in delivery seem to point to a return to the primordial concept of the masterbuilder, as exemplified by D/B and IPD [Integrated Project Delivery].

According to the DBIA, the design–build approach offers advantages to owners, including: &quot;One team, one contract, one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion.&quot;

==Debate on the merits of design–build vs. design–bid–build==

The rise of design–build project delivery has threatened the traditional hierarchies and silos of the design and construction industry. As a result, a debate has emerged over the value of design–build as a method of project delivery.

Critics of the design–build approach claim that design–build limits the clients&#x27; involvement in the design and allege that contractors often make design decisions outside their area of expertise. They also suggest that a designer—rather than a construction professional—is a better advocate for the client or project owner and/or that by representing different perspectives and remaining in their separate spheres, designers and builders ultimately create better buildings.

Proponents of design–build counter that design–build saves time and money for the owner, while providing the opportunity to achieve innovation in the delivered facility. They note that value is added because design-build brings value engineering into the design process at the onset of a project. Design–build allows the contractor, engineers and specialty trade contractors (subcontractors) to propose best-value solutions for various construction elements before the design is complete. Design–build brings all members of a project team together early in the process to identify and address issues of cost, schedule and constructability. Proponents suggest that as a result, design-build alleviates conflict between architects and contractors and reduces owner risk for design errors. They argue that once design is finalized and construction begins, the greatest opportunity to achieve cost savings has already been lost, and the potential for design errors is greater, leading to change orders that create cost growth and schedule delays. Proponents note that design–build allows owners to avoid being placed directly between the architect/engineer and the contractor. Under design–bid–build, the owner takes on significant risks because of that position. Design–build places the responsibility for design errors and omissions on the design–builder, relieving the owner of major legal and managerial responsibilities. The burden for these costs and associated risks are transferred to the design–build team.

The cost and schedule reduction and decreased litigation associated with design–build project delivery have been demonstrated repeatedly. Researches on &quot;Selecting Project Delivery Systems&quot; by Victor Sanvido and Mark Konchar of Pennsylvania State University found that design–build projects are delivered 33.5% faster than projects that are designed and built under separate contracts (design-bid-build). Sanvido and Konchar also showed that design–build projects are constructed 12% faster* and have a unit cost that is 6.1% lower than design-bid-build projects. Similar cost and time savings were found in a comparison study of design–build, and design-bid-build for the water/wastewater construction industry, a peer-reviewed paper authored by Smith Culp Consulting that will be published in July 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers. A benchmarking and claims study by Victor O. Schinnerer, one of the world&#x27;s largest firms underwriting professional liability and specialty insurance programs, found that, from 1995 to 2004, only 1.3% of claims against A/E firms were made by design–build contractors. Advantages have been summarized as:

* Efficiency: Typically led by contractors, &#x27;design–build&#x27; has evolved as an efficient way to deliver projects primarily where the building project goals are straightforward, either constrained by budget, or the outcome is prescribed by functional requirements (for example, a highway, sports facility, or brewery). Construction industry commentators have described design–build as a high performance &#x27;construction project delivery system&#x27;, a dynamic approach to making buildings that presents an alternative to the traditional design-bid-build approach.
* Single-source: Design–build is growing because of the advantages of single-source management: Unlike traditional design-bid-build, it allows for the owner to contract with just one party who acts as a single point of contact, is responsible for delivering the project and coordinates the rest of the team. Depending on the phasing of the project, there may be multiple sequential contracts between the owner and the design–builder. The owner benefits because if something turns out to be wrong with the project, there is a single entity that is responsible for fixing the problem, rather than a separate designer and constructor each blaming the other.

===Advantages for less-prescriptive projects===
Architect-led design–build is suited primarily to less prescriptive architectural projects (private residences, non-profit institutions, museums), for the efficiencies it yields and the sophisticated design interpretation it affords, particularly:
* Where the primary project goals are design-driven or visionary rather than prescribed by budgetary constraint or functional requirements
* Where the project is specifically &quot;Capital A&quot;-artistically/creatively driven, in a way that traditionally yields the highest level of cost overruns.
* Where the efficiencies of design–build approach and an architect&#x27;s interpretive skill are equally important

These less prescriptive projects need not be stuck with the &quot;broken buildings and busted budgets&quot; described by Barry Lepatner. Rather, the less prescriptive the project, the more the client needs an architect to steward an emergent design from vision to completion. So it follows that for the broadest range of building projects, the rigors of architect-led design–build is compelling and preferable where design is of paramount importance to the client.

===Recursive knowledge===
The process and the knowledge it produces is recursive: Since subcontractors are engaged early and often in an architect-led design build project, to assess efficiencies, opportunity costs, payback rates and quality options. Their input informs overall design decisions from the outset. Cost-benefit is also a constant consideration that informs design decisions from the outset. Building performance is measured early too, so that trade offs between budget, schedule, functionality and usability can inform specification and continuous refinement of the design.

Architects engaged in this dynamic process understand and keep up to date with the potential of contemporary technology and materials available to building professionals, and translate what they learn into their design work. This knowledge is fed back, not just to the specific project but can be shared to other project teams, throughout a studio, or more broadly to the profession, and can become an active source of insight in and of itself.

==Growth of design–build method==
A 2011 study analyzing the design–build project delivery method in the United States shows design–build was used on about 40 percent of non-residential construction projects in 2010, a ten percent increase since 2005. The study was commissioned by the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) and was completed by RSMeans Reed Construction Data Market Intelligence.

A study from the US Department of Transportation claims that: &quot;Design-build delivery has been steadily increasing in the U.S. public building sector for more than 10 years, but it is still termed experimental in transportation. To date, under Special Experimental Project 14 (SEP-14) the FHWA has approved the use of design–build in more than 150 projects, representing just over half of the States. The European countries visited have used design–build delivery for a longer time than the United States and provided the scan team with many valuable insights. The primary lessons learned on this scan tour relate to the types of projects using design–build, the use of best-value selection, percentage of design in the solicitation, design and construction administration, third-party risks, the use of warranties, and the addition of maintenance and operation to design–build contracts.&quot;

==Criticisms of design–build==
During the design–build procedure, the contractor is deciding on design issues as well as issues related to cost, profits and time exigencies. Whilst the traditional method of construction procurement dissociates the designers from the contractors&#x27; interests, design–build does not. On these grounds it is considered that the design–build procedure is poorly adapted to projects that require complex designs for technical, programmatic or aesthetic purposes. If the designer/architect is &#x27;kept&#x27; by the construction company, they probably will never push the envelope as to what might be possible. A notable design–build project that received significant criticism, not only for excessive cost but for environmental issues, was the Belmont Learning Center. The scandal involved alleged contaminated soil that caused significant delays and massive cost overruns. In Los Angeles, District Attorney Steve Cooley, who investigated the Los Angeles Unified School District&#x27;s Belmont project, produced a final investigative report, released March 2003. This report concluded that the design–build process caused a number of issues relating to the Belmont scandal:

* Design–build does not make use of competitive bidding where prospective builders bid on the same design.
* Criteria to select contractor are subjective and difficult to evaluate and to justify later.
* The design and price selected arouses public suspicion, true or not.
* This can lead to loss of public confidence.
* The design brief is subject to different interpretations from both the client and contractor, creating a conflict of interest.

It concluded the &quot;design–build&quot; approach and &quot;mixed-use concept&quot; together caused controversy, uncertainty, and complexity of the Belmont project which helped increase the potential for project failure. While the Belmont investigation cleared the Los Angeles Unified School District of any criminal wrongdoing, the task force recommends strict oversight, including written protocols, a vigorous Office of the Inspector General, and other recommendations if it decides to continue to use the design–build approach. During the period in question, the ex-Superintendent of LAUSD, Ramon C. Cortines, working with the LAUSD Board of Education, whose president is Monica Garcia, actively tried to cut the Office of Inspector General by 75% (compromising on 25%) and subsequently removed the Inspector General Jerry Thornton after he produced critical audits that showed misuse of construction funds.

Others have argued that architect-led design–build still does:
* Typical project management issues (establishing liability, writing contracts, scoping estimates and schedule) or
* Variation across different states&#x27; licensing laws or
* Conflict of interest and ethical issues

It also imposes:
* Greater business and financial risks associated with architect taking on general contractor responsibilities
* Changes to the way architects do business, so they
** Establish a construction company as a separate corporation that signs a separate construction contract, so they are able to insure and simplify liability insurance coverage
** Either they have, or are able to acquire, the skills of a design–builder
** Recognize the parties&#x27; different incentives
** Modify how they prepare Contract Documents, relying more on performance specifications than they do currently, to facilitate substitutions for the benefit of the constructor.

==Project examples==
Examples of contractor-led design–build projects include:
*Dena&#x27;ina Civic &amp; Convention Center, Anchorage, AK, Neeser Construction, Inc.: In 2010, it won the 2010 DBIA Design Build Merit Award for a public sector project over $50 million.
*Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication: Phoenix, AZ, Ehrlich Architects. In 2009, it won the 2009 DBIA National Design Build Award for a public sector project over $25 million.
*Federal Law Enforcement Training Center Dormitory, North Charleston, SC, The Korte Company. In 2012, it won the 2012 DBIA Design Build Merit Award for a public sector project over $15 million.

<doc id="1181135" wikidata="Q6540904" url="?curid=1181135" title="Liberalism in India">
<text>At the beginning of 19th century, then-Governor-General Lord William Bentinck speculated that the possibility of vast change occurring in the frame of society would eventually lead to the British leaving the country under capable Indian rule. But he also added that such changes should not be expected for centuries to come. 

At the end of 19th century, Gladstonian liberals inducted Indians from the elite class into new representative institutions, thereby providing a framework for later self-rule, which became a reality by 1947.

Three strands of liberalism have manifested in India- Colonial (eg: Charles Cornwallis, Thomas Babington Macaulay), Nationalist (eg: Rammohan Roy, Surendranath Banerjee), Radical (Jyotirao Phule, B. R. Ambedkar).

Right-wing journalist Swapan Dasgupta wrote in 1994 that the spirit of liberalism in India is superficial and is tempered by what he views as authoritarian ideologies like Marxism.

==History==

Rise of liberalism

Prominent ideas of classical liberalism emerged in United Kingdom at the wane of the 18th century. These began as primarily leftist schools of thought, including, but not limited to, concepts such as individualism, liberty, and egalitarianism. Simultaneously, British India, underwent a similar chrysalis. The effects of classical liberalism in India introduced many Western practices, philosophical doctrines, and political ideologies to the nation.

Governor Generals of the British East India Company Warren Hastings and Charles Cornwallis instituted numerous changes over their rules. Notably, Cornwallis instituted the Cornwallis Code in 1793, a code of law influenced by Hindu and Muslim legal frameworks. The code placed the British at the top of a system regarding caste and religion that was present in India at the time. This marked the beginning of more than a century of classical liberalism in British India 

Scottish writer James Mill gained prominence among the British around this time. Generally regarded as a utilitarian imperialist influenced by classical liberalism, his most successful work was &quot;A History of British India&quot;, published in 1817. Mill divided Indian history into three significant eras: Hindu (ancient), Muslim (medieval), and British (modern). Mill’s reductionist philosophy toward Indian history set harmful precedent for British figures and liberal policies in the years to come, including his son, John Stuart Mill, the policies of Governor General Thomas Macaulay, and numerous other figures. In his 1999 work &quot;Liberalism and Empire&quot;, Uday Singh Mehta outlines the framework that Mill proactively established, stating that a nation&#x27;s progress is dependent on a much more powerful nation: 

“Mill sees in the histories of backward civilizations a potentiality on account of which they can in fact progress. But the actualization of this potentiality typically turns on a force external to those civilizations … Hindu civilization, for Mill, epitomizes this condition of being stalled in the past. But various aspects of Hindu Civilization had prepared it for progressive transformation.”

Mehta later goes on to highlight Mill&#x27;s argument that the Muslims laid the foundation for British rule to thrive, and that Hindu and Muslim culture were in need of assistance from the British. This motif among British liberalists, that Indians (both Hindus and Muslims), were not capable of civilized self-rule, appears again, as a common occurrence throughout the nineteenth century. The significance of Mill&#x27;s opus is noticeable in the practical regulations established by Thomas Macaulay soon after. Macaulay served on Lord William Bentinck&#x27;s Governor-General Supreme Council from 1834 to 1838, and went on to publish his &quot;Minute on Indian Education&quot; in February 1835. This work set precedent for English education to be mandated in India, with the same, negative perception the British garnered toward Indians, as stated throughout:

“When we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded, and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable … all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England.”

Indian intellectuals of the era

A key figure from early 19th century is Raja Ram Mohan Roy. He, along with his compatriots, created a constitutional history for India centred on a local judicial body called Panchayat. Roy himself put forward arguments in favour of Indian representation in Parliament and for constitutionally limiting the East India Company&#x27; power. He felt that the Indian public would be empowered by free press and service on juries under a liberal British government. Roy wanted modernity in curriculum for Indian students while not rejecting tradition outright. He was inspired by Christian humanism and insisted on reforming Hinduism, making it more ethical and rational.

Another important person was Gopal Krishna Gokhale, leader of the Indian National Congress who demanded self-rule for the Indian subcontinent.

Radical liberals, in contrast to the moderates, were not interested in rehabilitating the Hindu past. They insisted that Hinduism cannot be redeemed because of its historical denial of rights to the downtrodden castes. Western education and scientific principles were to be the adopted rather than giving in to Brahminical dominance (again) according to the radicals like Ambedkar.

Liberalism in post-independence period 

Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is a proponent of liberalism in India, promoting individual rights, social equality, and constitutional democracy. As the primary architect of the Indian Constitution, he incorporated liberal ideas such as free speech, secularism, and the rule of law, assuring protections for oppressed groups. Ambedkar championed education as a method of emancipation, arguing that universal access is necessary for individual empowerment. While his method had elements of classical liberalism. He emphasized human dignity and self-reliance while also advocating for state participation in social justice, including affirmative action and economic safeguards to promote inclusive growth. His idea transformed Indian society into a more equal democracy, integrating liberalism and social justice.

Following independence, various critics emerged against Nehruvian Liberalism, such as Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari, informally known as Rajaji, who parted ways with the Indian National Congress in 1957 and formed the Swatantra Party which supported classical liberal principles and free enterprise. Since then, many new thinkers such as S. V. Raju, Sharad Anantrao Joshi, Barun Mitra, Jayaprakash Narayan, Parth J. Shah, Gurcharan Das, Sauvik Chakraverti, Raghavendar Askani, Venkatesh Geriti, among others, have emerged on the Indian liberal scene, contributing to the debate on freedom in India, and advancing classical liberalism.

Role of the State

One view is that Indian liberalism has primarily been the context created by the actions of the State – it is not easy to identify a consistent and organic belief system in the country as &#x27;liberal&#x27;.

==Economic liberalisation==
India&#x27;s first attempt at economic liberalisation was carried out in 1966 as a precondition to an increase in foreign aid.

After Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1984, many young leaders supporting liberal ideologies were made ministers.

The economic liberalisation of 1991, initiated by then-Prime Minister of India P. V. Narasimha Rao in response to a balance-of-payments crisis, did away with the License Raj and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors.

==Present situation==

The defeat of Indian liberalism at the hands of illiberal political formations has been attributed to elitism, estrangement from the ideal of equality, and the bad faith inherent in its concept of secularism.

<text>[[Liberalism]] in [[Iran]] or Iranian liberalism is a political ideology that traces its beginnings to the 20th century.

== Iranian Liberalism during 1900–1979 ==
=== Society for the Progress of Iran ===
During the constitutional period of Persia and active during the 2nd term of Majlis, 1909–1911, the party Society of the Supporters for Progress championed the development of southern provinces of Persia and was consisted of MPs representing the southerners. They promoted building hospitals, women&#x27;s education and regarded Persian as &quot;the official and scholarly&quot; language of Iran. The party was liberal Islamic, nationalist, constitutionalist and anti-imperialist.

Its organ &quot;Jonub&quot; () was printed in Tehran and usually criticized Bakhtiaris, and held the view that Iranian government does not understand the importance of the Persian Gulf region. The newspaper defended democracy and civil rights and explained that the &quot;level of progress of any nation is symbolized in its degree of freedom of expression and press&quot; and that the elections are the only means to exercise popular sovereignty and protect territorial integrity as well as national interests.

The party was small and insignificant in numbers, but helped holding the balance of power in the 2nd Majlis, allying with the Moderate Socialists Party and Union and Progress Party against the Democrat Party.

=== Revival Party ===
During 1920s, the secular progressive Revival Party or Modernity Party was formed by young western-educated reformists, it was mainly organized by Ali Akbar Davar, Mohammad Tadayon and Abdolhossein Teymourtash, and was led by former Democrat Party politicians who had lost confidence in the masses, in contrast to the Socialist Party which was led by former Democrats who retained hope to mobilize lower classes. Many constitutionalist veterans were associated with the party, including Mohammad Ali Foroughi, Mostowfi ol-Mamalek, Hassan Taqizadeh, Mohammad-Taqi Bahar and Ebrahim Hakimi. The party had also liberal and nationalist tendencies and supported Reza Khan and helped him become the new Shah of Iran while holding majority in the parliament.

The party&#x27;s platform was based on &quot;separation of religion and politics, creating a strong army, an efficient administrative system, to end the economic rates, industrialize Iran, instead of replacing domestic investment of foreign capital into the agricultural tribes, development of the income tax system, educational facilities to the public, including women, opportunities for the flourishing of talents, and throughout the promotion of Persian language instead of local languages&quot;.

=== National Front of Iran ===

Founded by Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1949, the National Front of Iran it is the oldest and arguably the largest pro-democracy group operating inside Iran despite the fact that it never was able to recover its prominence in the early 1950s. Before 1953 and throughout the 1960s, the front was torn by strife between secular and religious elements and over the time has splintered into various squabbling factions, gradually emerging as the leading organization of secular liberals with nationalist members adhering to liberal democracy and social democracy. Amidst Iranian Revolution, the front supported the replacement of the old monarchy by an Islamic Republic and was the main symbol of &quot;nationalist&quot; tendency in the early years of post-revolutionary government. It was banned in July 1981 and although officially remains illegal and under constant surveillance, is still active inside Iran.

Prominent members are Mohammad Mosaddegh (leader of the party during 1949–1960), Allah-Yar Saleh (leader during 1960–1964), Karim Sanjabi (leader during 1967–1988), Adib Boroumand (leader during 1993–2017) and Davoud Hermidas-Bavand (current spokesperson).

Mohammad Mosaddegh held government office as the Prime Minister of Iran from 1951 until 1953, when his government was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état aided by the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service. An author, administrator, lawyer, and prominent parliamentarian, his administration introduced a range of progressive social and political reforms such as social security and land reforms, including taxation of the rent on land. His government&#x27;s most notable policy, however, was the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry, which had been under British control since 1913 through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC/) (later British Petroleum and BP).

Many Iranians regard Mosaddegh as the leading champion of secular democracy and resistance to foreign domination in Iran&#x27;s modern history. Mosaddegh was removed from power in a coup on 19 August 1953, organized and carried out by the CIA at the request of MI6, which chose Iranian General Fazlollah Zahedi to succeed Mosaddegh. While the coup is commonly referred to in the West as Operation Ajax after its CIA cryptonym, in Iran it is referred to as the 28 Mordad 1332 coup, after its date on the Iranian calendar.

=== Iran Party ===
Established in 1949, the Iran Party is described as the &quot;backbone of the National Front&quot;, the leading umbrella organization of Iranian nationalists. Founded by mostly of European-educated technocrats, it advocated &quot;a diluted form of French socialism&quot; (i.e. it &quot;modeled itself on&quot; the moderate Socialist Party of France) and promoted social democracy, liberal nationalism and secularism. The socialist tent of the party was more akin to that of the Fabian Society than to the scientific socialism of Karl Marx. Its focus on liberal socialism and democratic socialism principles, made it quite different from pure left-wing parties and it did not show much involvement in labour rights discussions. The Iran Party&#x27;s basic nucleus were members of the Iranian Engineers&#x27; Association. In the Iranian legislative election, 1944, five of the party&#x27;s leaders including Rezazadeh Shafaq, Ghulam&#x27;Ali Farivar, AhdulHamid Zanganeh, Hussein Mu&#x27;aven, and Abdallah Mu&#x27;azemi won seats, as well as Mohammad Mossadegh who was not a member but the party effectively supported. The party helped Mossadegh establish the National Front, nationalize the oil industry and rise to power. Some members held office during Mosaddegh government. In the 1950s, the party was led by Karim Sanjabi and Allah-Yar Saleh. It was suppressed following the British–American backed coup d&#x27;état in 1953 and was outlawed in 1957, on the grounds that it had an alliance with the Tudeh Party of Iran ten years earlier. It was revived in 1960 and actively contributed to the National Front (II), which was disintegrated in 1963 and forced to survive secretly. Iran Party held a congress in 1964. Not much is known about the activities of the party between 1964 and the mid-1970s except of some irregular meetings and exchanging views. In 1977, alongside League of Socialists and Nation Party it revived the National Front (IV) and demanded Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s return to Iran. In early 1979, then secretary-general of the party, Shapour Bakhtiar was appointed as the last Prime Minister by the Shah and included two Iran Party members in his cabinet. The party however denounced his acceptance of the post, expelled him and called him a &quot;traitor&quot;. The party did not play an important role in Iranian political arena after 1979 and was soon declared banned.

=== People&#x27;s Party ===
Founded in in Pahlavi era, People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Mardom&quot;) was one of two major parties in the apparent attempt to decree a two-party system by Shah, apparently opposition to the ruling New Iran Party and previously Party of Nationalists. The party was dissolved in 1975, in order to be merged into newly founded Resurgence Party, the only legal party in the attempted single-party system.

=== Freedom Movement of Iran ===

Founded in 1961, the Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI) is an Iranian pro-democracy political organization, its members describes themselves as &quot;Muslims, Iranians, Constitutionalists and Mossadeghists&quot;. A split to the National Front (II), the party was established with support and blessings of Mohammad Mossadegh and soon applied for the membership in the front with a platform advocating national sovereignty, freedom of political activity and expression, social justice under Islam, respect for Iran&#x27;s constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Charter of the United Nations. It believes in the separation of church and state, while that political activity should be guided by religious values. The party&#x27;s ideologies are iranian nationalism, islamic democracy, islamic liberalism and constitutionalism.

Despite being outlawed by the prevailing regime in Iran, the group continues to exist. The organization accepts to comply with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran despite its rejection for Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist. It has been described as a &quot;semi-opposition&quot; or &quot;loyal opposition&quot; party. The organization&#x27;s members have close ties to the Council of Nationalist-Religious Activists of Iran.

Prominent members are Mehdi Bazargan, Ebrahim Yazdi, Mostafa Chamran, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and Ali Shariati.

Mehdi Bazargan (1 September 1907 – 20 January 1995), an Iranian scholar, academic, long-time pro-democracy activist, was head of Iran&#x27;s interim government, making him Iran&#x27;s first prime minister after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. He resigned his position as prime minister in November 1979, in protest of the US Embassy takeover and as an acknowledgement of his government&#x27;s failure in preventing it. He was the head of the first engineering department of University of Tehran.

Bazargan is considered to be a respected figure within the ranks of modern Muslim thinkers, well known as a representative of liberal-democratic Islamic thought and a thinker who emphasized the necessity of constitutional and democratic policies. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution Bazargan led a faction that opposed the Revolutionary Council dominated by the Islamic Republican Party and personalities such as Ayatollah Mohammad Hossein Beheshti. He opposed the continuation of the Iran–Iraq War and the involvement of clerics in all aspects of politics, economy and society. Consequently, he faced harassment from militants and young revolutionaries within Iran.

== Liberalism in the Islamic Republic: 1979–present ==
=== National Democratic Front ===
During the Iranian Revolution of 1979 that overthrew shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the liberal-left National Democratic Front was founded by Hedayatollah Matin-Daftari, a grandson of celebrated Iranian nationalist Mohammad Mosaddeq and a &quot;lawyer who had been active in human rights causes&quot; before the downfall of the shah and the son of the fourth prime minister and the jurist Ahmad Matin-Daftari. The party was banned within a short time by the Islamic government. Though it was short-lived, the party has been described as one of &quot;the three major movements of the political center&quot; in Iran at that time.

The NDF &quot;emphasized political freedoms, guarantees for individual rights, access for all political groups to the broadcast media, the curbing of the Revolutionary Guards, revolutionary courts, and revolutionary committees. Its economic programs favored &quot;the mass of the people&quot;, and it supported a &quot;decentralized system of administration based on popularly elected local councils.&quot;

Along with the Fadayan and some Kurdish groups the NDP boycotted the March 30, 31, 1979 referendum on making Iran an Islamic Republic (the Referendum of 12 Farvardin). In the debate over Iran&#x27;s new revolutionary constitution it supported a parliamentary democracy with equal rights for women, adoption of the universal declaration of human rights and limited presidential powers. &quot;Expressing concern over the freedom of elections and government control over the broadcast media,&quot; along with the National Front they announced they would boycott the election for the 1st Assembly of Experts, which wrote the new constitution.

=== Executives of Construction of Iran Party ===
In 1996, the Executives of Construction Party was founded by 16 members of the cabinet of the then President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. The party is a member of Council for coordinating the Reforms Front.

Economically, the party supports free markets and industrialization; with a high emphasis on the progress and development. The party&#x27;s ideologies are reformism, pragmatism, technocracy and liberal democracy. It takes the view that economic freedom is fundamentally linked to cultural and political freedom, but it should not be allowed to conflict with development. The party is divided into two factions in constant struggle, the more conservative &quot;Kermani faction&quot; led by Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani and Hossein Marashi and the more liberal &quot;Isfahani faction&quot; led by Mohammad Atrianfar and Gholamhossein Karbaschi.

== Women&#x27;s rights ==


The Iranian women&#x27;s movement involves the movement for women&#x27;s rights and women&#x27;s equality in Iran. The movement first emerged some time after the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. The first journal published by a woman in Iran was &quot;Danesh&quot;, started in 1910. The movement lasted until 1933 in which the last women&#x27;s association was dissolved by the Reza Shah&#x27;s government. It heightened again after the Iranian Revolution (1979). Between 1962 and 1978, the Iranian women&#x27;s movement gained tremendous victories: women won the right to vote in 1963 as part of Mohammad Reza Shah&#x27;s White Revolution, and were allowed to stand for public office, and in 1975 the Family Protection Law provided new rights for women, including expanded divorce and custody rights and reduced polygamy. In 1969 women even began to drive cars and the first women to ever drive a car in Iran was Eileen Zayer from the United States. Following the 1979 Revolution, several laws were established such as the introduction of mandatory veiling and public dress code of females. Women&#x27;s rights since the Islamic Revolution have varied. In November 2016, about 6% of Iranian parliament members were women, while the global average was about 23%.

== Political freedom and dissent ==
In a 2008 report, the organization Human Rights Watch complained that &quot;broadly worded &#x27;security laws&#x27;&quot; in Iran are used &quot;to arbitrarily suppress and punish individuals for peaceful political expression, association, and assembly, in breach of international human rights treaties to which Iran is party.&quot; For example, &quot;connections to foreign institutions, persons, or sources of funding&quot; are enough to bring criminal charges such as &quot;undermining national security&quot; against individuals.

Regarding the gradual unraveling of the reformist movement, an article from &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine said, The Tehran spring of ten years ago has now given way to a bleak political winter. The new government continues to close down newspapers, silence dissenting voices and ban or censor books and websites. The peaceful demonstrations and protests of the Khatami era are no longer tolerated: in January 2007 security forces attacked striking bus drivers in Tehran and arrested hundreds of them. In March, police beat hundreds of men and women who had assembled to commemorate International Women&#x27;s Day.

Although relatively peaceful when compared to the state-sponsored assassinations that occurred in the first decade of the Islamic republic, throughout the 1990s the theocratic regime rarely hesitated to apply violent tactics to crush its political adversaries, with demonstrators and dissidents commonly being imprisoned, beaten, tortured or murdered (&quot;disappeared&quot;).

The Iran student riots, July 1999 were sparked following an attack by an estimated 400 paramilitary Hezbollah vigilantes on a student dormitory in retaliation for a small, peaceful student demonstration against the closure of the reformist newspaper, &quot;Salam&quot; earlier that day.&quot; At least twenty people were hospitalized and hundreds were arrested,&quot; in the attack. Ahmad Batebi, a demonstrator in the July 1999 Iranian student riots, received a death sentence for &quot;propaganda against the Islamic Republic System.&quot; (His sentence was later reduced to 15, and then ten years imprisonment.)

<text>Treforest () is a village in the south-east of Pontypridd, in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. It is situated in the Treforest electoral ward, along with the village of Glyntaff (or Glyn-Taf). It is part of the Pontypridd Town community. Treforest runs along the west bank of the River Taff (), while Glyntaff runs along its east bank.

Treforest extends from immediately south-east of Ynysangharad Park, where the A4058 link from the A470 joins the A473 Broadway (south of the adjoining wards of Graig and Trallwn), all the way to join the Tonteg ward in the south (part of the community of Llantwit Fardre).

The village is historically connected with the Crawshay family, who established a major tinplate works in 1835. Treforest is now known for its association with the University of South Wales, originally established as the Newport Mechanics Institute in the 1840s, 
the campus in Treforest was established as the School of Mines in 1913.

Treforest Industrial Estate is not part of Treforest or its electoral ward, most of which is not even within Pontypridd. Instead, this falls partly within the area of Upper Boat (Pontypridd), but mostly within the Willowford area of Ton-Teg (Llantwit Fardre) and Nantgarw (Taffs Well ward).

==Transport==

==Education==
Treforest has two primary schools; Parc Lewis, and St. Michael&#x27;s; though a third school, Trefforest Primary, closed in 2006 despite the petitions from parents, governors and local councillor, as a result of a process commenced by the 1999–2004 administration on the Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. The University of South Wales&#x27; Trefforest campus (previously the University of Glamorgan) is located in the village.

==Culture==
The population of Treforest consists substantially of students living away from home, who often leave the village during the summer months, and return in the new academic year.

Treforest is home to association football team Treforest F.C.: this mid-sized Club currently runs teams from Under 8 level to Seniors. The Senior teams play in the South Wales Alliance League and Taff Ely and Rhymney Valley Leagues. Treforest has a purpose-built stadium and club facilities with two bars. Treforest F.C. is affiliated to the South Wales Football Association and is a full member of the Football Association of Wales.

==Governance==
Treforest has been an electoral ward to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council since 1995, electing one county borough councillor. It has been represented by the Labour Party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats at various points since 1995.

Treforest is also a community ward to Pontypridd Town Council, electing three town councillors.

It is part of the South Wales Central region in the Senedd and there is one directly elected member from the Pontypridd constituency and four additional regional members.

In the Westminster parliament it is part of the Pontypridd constituency.

==Treforest Estate==

The Treforest Trading Estate, later renamed Treforest Industrial Estate, originated with the formation of the &#x27;South Wales and Monmouthshire Trading Estates Ltd.&#x27; in June 1936. This non-profit making company aimed to establish one or more trading estates in Wales, and the first sod was cut on . By the end of 1937, three small factories had been completed and occupied. The first building contract awarded was a large factory for the British Coated Board and Paper Company Ltd (Wiggins Teape).

During the Second World War, the factories on the estate played a major role in the war effort and national economy; many buildings were requisitioned by the government, and their occupants re-housed in makeshift buildings away from the estate. Extensions and new factories were built by government departments.

Many of the companies on the Estate were established by businesspeople who had arrived as refugees from German-occupied Europe. They had often been able to bring money and equipment with them.

By 1944, almost 16,000 people were being employed on the estate. In 1960, the estate came under the control of the &#x27;Welsh Industrial Estates Corporation&#x27;, and later, the Welsh Development Agency.

Companies which have operated factories on the Estate include: BOAC, Aero Zip, Metal Alloys Ltd, Afon Tinplate Ltd, Finetex Ltd, Ford, South Wales Switchgear, Standard Telephones and Cables, Fram Filters and KLG Spark Plugs.

In December 2023 a fire broke out on the estate. At around 19:00 on 13 December there was an explosion followed by a fire at Rizla House, a building housing multiple businesses, killing one person.

<doc id="1181141" wikidata="Q6540903" url="?curid=1181141" title="Liberalism in Honduras">
<text>[[Liberalism]] in [[Honduras]] is a form of Latin American liberalism. It was influenced by French revolutionaries from 1789 to 1799, when the door was open for ideas of positivism. During this time the populace were exposed to liberal ideas such as: liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty, causing enthusiasm for them to be increased.

==Political parties==

The Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras, or PLH) was founded in 1890 and has both conservative and progressive wings. It is a member of Liberal International and is seen as a traditional center-liberal party. The diversity of the party is reflected in the existence of factions within it.

In contrast to most others in Latin America, the Honduran liberals remained united in one party for much of the movement&#x27;s history; however, after the 2009 Honduran coup d&#x27;état former president Manuel Zelaya, who had been a member of the Liberal Party, and his supporters, many of them former Liberal Party members, split away and formed a new party, Liberty and Refoundation, also known as Libre.

==History==
In the early years after the region achieved independence from Spain, Honduras was a constituent of the United Provinces of Central America, but its cohesion was undermined by friction between liberals and conservatives. The liberal position was in favor of republicanism, free trade, less centralized government, and above all: the removal of the political and economic powers of the Catholic Church.

The Honduran liberal, Francisco Morazán, became president of the United Provinces in 1830. Morazán enacted many reforms, including freedom of speech, the press, and religion; trial by jury; and others intended to improve equality of socioeconomic status. The reforms were objected to by conservative elements of society, while the separation of Church and State, which allowed for secular marriage, divorce, and an end to government-enforced tithing, made many of the clergy enemies of Morazán and the liberals. This caused the breakup of the Provinces.

Independent Honduras was initially under the control of conservative leaders, this dominance lasting until the liberal Marco Aurelio Soto assumed the presidency on 27 August 1876. He and his Secretary General Ramón Rosa were the principal proponents of liberal reformism in Honduras. In the following period, liberals dominated the country and encouraged foreign investment and economic growth. Soto and his successors were responsible for the reform of the powers of judiciary and church, Professionalization of the armed forces, as well as modernization of communications and education. In this way, they paved the way for Honduras to become a state capable of taking a place on the global stage.

Various liberals held the presidency through to 1903, namely Luis Bográn (1883-1891), Ponciano Leiva (1891-1893), José Policarpo Bonilla Vásquez (1895-1899) and Terencio Esteban Sierra Romero (1899-1903). After this period, liberals ruled the country from 1907-1911 (Miguel Rafael Dávila Cuéllar), 1920-1924 (Rafael López Gutiérrez), and 1929 to 1933 (Vicente Mejía).

After 1933, a period of conservative dictatorial rule started. It was not until 1957 that the liberals would regain power with the democratic election of Ramón Villeda to the presidency. He was deposed by a bloody military coup in 1963, which led to another long period of military rule. This ended with the creation of a constituent assembly and the writing of a new constitution in 1982, elections held in 1981, and the approval of the constitution and democratic election of the liberal Roberto Suazo as president in 1982, all of which restored Honduras as a presidential democracy. Liberals were also elected president in 1985 (José Azcona), 1993 (Carlos Roberto Reina) and 1998 (Carlos Roberto Flores).

<text>Major General Daniel Marcus William Beak, (27 January 1891 – 3 May 1967) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Beak was born in Southampton, Hampshire on 27 Jan 1891 and educated at Taunton&#x27;s School.

==First World War==
===1915–1917===
Beak joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a rating on 2 February 1915, but before seeing action was commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Division in May 1915. He was posted to the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, but it is not clear from his service record if he saw action in that theatre. He arrived in France in May 1916, and after being appointed adjutant of Drake Battalion on 2 March 1917, he ended up commanding his battalion as an acting commander between 19 March 1917 and 3 April 1917. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant commander on relinquishing command, and attached to headquarters.

He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in January 1917, and a Bar to his MC on 18 July 1917. The citations read:

He attended the Senior Officers&#x27; Course in Aldershot in late 1917 and on 31 December was promoted temporary commander, and appointed as commanding officer of the Howe Battalion.

===1918===
Beak remained in command of the Howe Battalion, then briefly commanded the Anson Battalion in the first week of March 1918, and then transferred back to the Drake Battalion on 13 March 1918. He was Mentioned in Despatches on 20 May, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 26 July 1918, the citation read:

He was sick for four days with the flu in July 1918, and was granted a period of home leave in August, returning on 10 August. During the period 21/25 August and on 4 September 1918 at Logeast Wood, France, Commander Beak led his men and captured four enemy positions under heavy fire. Four days later, although dazed by a shell fragment, in the absence of the brigade commander, he reorganised the whole brigade under extremely heavy gun fire and led his men to their objective. When an attack was held up, accompanied by only one runner he succeeded in breaking up a nest of machine-guns, personally bringing in nine or ten prisoners. His initiative and the confidence with which he inspired all ranks, contributed very materially to the success of these operations. In recognition of his efforts, Beak was awarded the Victoria Cross. The full citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 12 November 1918 (dated 15 November 1918):

He received a second Mention in Despatches on 20 December 1918. With the war now over he was granted several periods of home leave, returned home permanently in May 1919, and was demobilised in June.

==Inter-war service==
In 1921, he was granted a regular army commission with the Royal Scots Fusiliers as a captain. Beak was in Ireland with his regiment during the Irish War of Independence. In the situation, following the collapse of the British civilian administration, his duties included membership of the &quot;Courts of Enquiry in lieu of Inquests.&quot; In July 1921 he is documented as a member of the enquiry into the shooting of Richard and Abraham Pearson by the South Offaly No. 2 Brigade IRA.

He was given a brevet promotion to major in 1929, and substantive promotion in 1932, on transfer to the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool). He was promoted brevet lieutenant colonel in 1935. The substantive promotion followed in 1938, transferring again, this time to the South Lancashire Regiment.

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, Beak was initially the Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment which fought in the Battle of France. In June 1940 he was made commander of 12th Brigade, GOC Malta Command and 151st Infantry Brigade, part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which he led during Operation Pugilist. General Sir Bernard Montgomery dismissed him from this post after that battle and he never held another command.

He was an acting brigadier by 2 August 1940 when his promotion to colonel was gazetted. A Mention in Despatches was gazetted on 20 December 1940, for services between March and June of that year. He was promoted temporary major general in January 1942. He retired from the army on 19 February 1945, retaining the honorary rank of major general.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

He is buried in an unmarked grave at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey but in recognition of his close ties to Cheltenham, where he served as Acting Secretary of Cheltenham YMCA in 1913, they, together with &quot;This England&quot; magazine, erected a commemorative plaque by the main war memorial in the Promenade, which was dedicated by the Mayor of Cheltenham on 27 September 2006.

<text>[[Liberalism]] in Mexico was part of a broader nineteenth-century political trend affecting Western Europe and the Americas, including the United States, that challenged entrenched power. In Mexico, liberalism sought to make fundamental the equality of individuals before the law, rather than their benefiting from special privileges of corporate entities, especially the Roman Catholic Church, the military, and indigenous communities. Liberalism viewed universal, free, secular education as the means to transform Mexico&#x27;s citizenry. Early nineteenth-century liberals promoted the idea of economic development in the overwhelmingly rural country where much land was owned by the Catholic Church and held in common by indigenous communities to create a large class of yeoman farmers. Liberals passed a series of individual Reform laws and then wrote a new constitution in 1857 to give full force to the changes. Liberalism in Mexico &quot;was not only a political philosophy of republicanism but a package including democratic social values, free enterprise, a legal bundle of civil rights to protect individualism, and a group consciousness of nationalism.&quot; Mexican liberalism is most closely associated with anticlericalism. Mexican liberals looked to the U.S. as their model for development and actively sought the support of the U.S., while Mexican conservatives looked to Europe.

==History==

===Nineteenth-century Mexican liberalism===
The term &quot;liberal&quot; became the name of a political faction, which previously had called itself &quot;the Party of Progress&quot; in contrast to the Conservative Party, which they called &quot;the Party of Regression.&quot; Conservatives characterized themselves as those that defended Mexican tradition of the colonial era. Following Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, the first Mexican liberals became important on the national scene. The most prominent was secular priest and intellectual, José María Luis Mora (1794–1850), who was influenced by Montesquieu, Benjamin Constant, and Jeremy Bentham. Mora attacked corporate privilege, especially the &quot;fueros&quot; of the Roman Catholic Church; considered the role of utilitarianism (the greatest good for the greatest number) in Mexico; examined the so-called &quot;Indian Question,&quot; of how to modernize Mexico when the majority of the population was indigenous living in rural communities; and considered the role of liberalism in economic development. Lorenzo de Zavala was another prominent liberal of that generation, but he sided with Anglo-Texan rebels in their successful war for independence, with Zavala subsequently considered a traitor to Mexico. The early post-independence era was dominated by General Antonio López de Santa Anna and Mexican conservatives, who were more effective in forming an ideologically unified political force, so that Mexican liberals were rarely able to exercise political power nationally.

Most Mexican liberals looked to European thinkers in their formulation of their ideology, which has led to a debate about whether those ideas were merely &quot;Mexicanized&quot; versions. In practice in Mexico, liberals viewed the U.S. political and economic system as a model for Mexico, and actively sought U.S. aid when they came to power in 1855, when the liberal Revolution of Ayutla forced conservative strongman Antonio López de Santa Anna into exile. In Mexico, the most salient aspects of nineteenth-century liberalism were to create a secular state separated from the Roman Catholic Church, establish equality before the law by abolishing corporate privileges (&quot;fueros&quot;) of the Catholic church, the military, both of which had their own courts, and indigenous communities, which held land in common. Liberals&#x27; aim was to transform Mexico into a modern secular state with a dynamic economy. Corporate privilege and the conservative elite defenders were considered stumbling blocks to the nation&#x27;s political, social, and economic progress. Secular, public education was a key element in opening paths to achievement for all Mexican citizens. Schooling historically had been the domain of the Roman Catholic Church and limited to elite men, so that broadening educational access and having a secular curriculum was seen as a way to transform Mexican society. The breakup of land owned by corporations, specifically the Roman Catholic Church and indigenous communities, was a crucial policy element in diminishing the power of the church and integrating Mexico&#x27;s Indians into the republic as citizens and transforming them into yeoman farmers. Unlike many liberals elsewhere, Mexican liberals did not call for limitations on executive power, but early Mexican liberals were largely federalists who wanted considerable power reserved for the states and not the central government.
With Mexico&#x27;s defeat in the Mexican–American War (1846–48), a new generation of what historian Enrique Krauze calls &quot;romantic liberals&quot; emerged. They were rooted in literature, and read and translated European writers such as Lamartine, Michelet, Byron, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. Outstanding among these Mexican liberals were Ignacio Ramírez (1818–1879); Guillermo Prieto (1818–1897); and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano (1834–1893), who was of indigenous Nahua origin and rose to be a major literary figure and journalist. These intellectuals lived through and tried to shape political thought in the War of the Reform between conservatives and liberals, and the Second French intervention, a foreign intervention supported by Mexican conservatives.

Pragmatic politicians, preeminently Benito Juárez, born in a Zapotec village in Oaxaca, as well as Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, his brother Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, and Melchor Ocampo aimed at transforming liberal ideas into legislation and reform. They were all guided by liberal principles and fought for them. Liberals enacted reform laws to curtail the power of the Church and the army in the Juárez Law (1856) and undermined the Church&#x27;s economic power with the 1856 Lerdo Law, which prohibited corporations—the Roman Catholic Church, as well as indigenous communities—for holding title to land. In 1857, liberals drafted and promulgated a new constitution and required Mexicans to take an oath of fealty to it. Many in the army opposed the Liberal Reform and the Catholic hierarchy in November 1857 forbade Catholics from taking the oath or face ex-communication. Moderate liberal politician, Ignacio Comonfort sought to forge a middle ground when General Félix Zuloaga promulgated the Plan of Tacubaya, which declared the liberal constitution nullified, but allowed President Comonfort to retain his office and with enhanced powers. Comonfort signed onto the plan and many liberals were jailed, including Juárez. When it quickly became clear that Comonfort&#x27;s hope to chart a middle course between conservatives and liberals had failed, he resigned from the presidency after freeing the jailed liberals. Benito Juárez had been head of the Supreme Court and with Comonfort&#x27;s resignation, he succeeded to the presidency as Mexico was plunged into civil war.

With the ouster of the French in 1867 and the discrediting of Mexican conservatives who had supported the regime of foreign monarch Maximilian I of Mexico, Juárez, and his successor following his death of natural causes in 1872, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada could implement the Reform laws passed in the 1850s. With religious toleration mandated, the Roman Catholic Church was no longer the sole spiritual institution in Mexico; it was excluded from its former role as the only educators of the nation; and its economic power was diminished.

With that major liberal victory won, a third generation of liberals emerged during the presidency of liberal general and military hero of the Second French intervention in Mexico, Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876–1911). During the Porfiriato, a new group of liberals in name only, the &quot;científicos,&quot; were influenced by the Positivism of French philosopher Auguste Comte, and Saint-Simon, scientist Charles Darwin, and Herbert Spencer, known for social Darwinism. Historian and educator Justo Sierra was the most prolific and influential of this group surrounding Díaz. A group of Mexican politicians supporting the increasingly dictatorial Díaz regime characterized themselves as the &quot;Cientificos&quot;, &quot;scientists&quot;. Díaz&#x27;s supporters became comfortable with a strong executive, traditionally associated with conservative ideology, as a pragmatic means to achieve stability and ensure economic growth. Under Díaz, a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with the Roman Catholic Church emerged whereby it regained a portion of its power and influence, but the anticlerical articles of the Constitution of 1857 remained theoretically enforced.

===Liberalism in the 20th century===

As the Díaz regime became increasingly dictatorial and trampled on the rights and liberties of Mexicans, a group of Mexican oppositionists led by Camilo Arriaga and Ricardo Flores Magón formed the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM). It called for the overthrow of Díaz and agitated for the rights of workers and peasants and for economic nationalism favoring Mexicans rather than foreigners. The PLM had two basic factions, one was reformist and was supported by elite, urban intellectuals and the other was anarcho-communist and advocated revolution. As the opposition to Díaz grew, Liberal clubs met secretly in Mexican cities to discuss politics, which led to the First Liberal Congress that met in San Luis Potosí in 1901. Radicals, such as Flores Magón, were exiled to the United States and drafted the Liberal Party program in 1905. A reformist liberal, rich hacienda owner Francisco I. Madero founded the Anti-Reelectionist Party and ran against Díaz in the 1910 presidential elections. He garnered support from PLM members in the campaign. The fraudulent 1910 elections sparked revolts throughout many parts of the country, considered the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, and Díaz was forced to resign.

At the outbreak of the uprising against Díaz, the opposition pointed to his continued re-election and abrogation of the liberal Constitution of 1857. Francisco Madero was brought to power by revolutionary forces, but he had hoped to proceed via the constitutional path with election. With the ouster of Díaz, his resignation and exile, Madero agreed to an interim government until new elections could be held in fall 1911. He won the presidency overwhelmingly. He lifted censorship of the press, suppression of strikes, and other measures that Díaz had employed to keep dissent in check. Madero was overthrown in a military coup in February 1913. A broad coalition of opposition to the new government formed itself as the Constitutionalist Army, invoking the Constitution of 1857. That faction was victorious in the Mexican Revolution under the leadership of former Governor of Coahuila Venustiano Carranza. Carranza sought legitimacy for his regime and called for a constitutional convention, which excluded the defeated factions of the revolution. What Carranza envisioned to be a tune-up of the 1857 charter instead was a new constitution, the Constitution of 1917, which remains in force.

<text>Heinrich Lübbe (; 12 January 1884 in Nienburg, Province of Hanover – 14 March 1940 in Berlin) was a German engineer working for Dutch aircraft designer Anthony Fokker during the First World War. He devised the pioneering &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gun synchronizer which enabled a machine gun to fire through the arc of a fighter aircraft&#x27;s propeller without the bullets striking the propeller&#x27;s blades. It was first fitted to &quot;Leutnant&quot; Otto Parschau&#x27;s Fokker A.III bearing IdFlieg military serial number A.16/15 in the late spring of 1915, to create the prototype of the entire line of Fokker Eindecker single-seat fighters to come.

In late 1925 Lübbe invested 135,000 Reichmarks in the Rostock branch of the wartime company which had been renamed earlier that year. Historian Volker Koos believes that Lübbe or some of the other investors probably served as straw men for the Reich Ministry of Transport which kept the company alive with small orders until 1933. His refusal to join the Nazi Party in 1936 led to his removal when Arado was nationalized.

<text>[[Liberalism]] in [[Egypt]] or Egyptian liberalism is a political ideology that traces its beginnings to the 19th century.

==History==

Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi (also spelt Tahtawy; 1801–1873) was an Egyptian writer, teacher, translator, Egyptologist and renaissance intellectual. In 1831, Tahtawi was part of the statewide effort to modernize the Egyptian infrastructure and education. He undertook a career in writing and translation, and founded the School of Languages (also knowns as &quot;School of Translators&quot;) in 1835, which become part of Ain Shams University in 1973. The School of Languages graduated the earliest modern Egyptian intellectual milieu, which formed the basis of the emerging grassroots mobilization against British colonialism in Egypt. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral philosophy. They introduced his Egyptian audience to Enlightenment ideas such as secular authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or &quot;good Egyptian&quot;; and his ideas on public interest and public good. Tahtawi&#x27;s work was the first effort in what became an Egyptian renaissance (&quot;nahda&quot;) that flourished in the years between 1860 and 1940.

Tahtawi is considered one of the early adapters to Islamic Modernism. Islamic Modernists attempted to integrate Islamic principles with European social theories. In 1826, Al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris by Mehmet Ali. Tahtawi studied at an educational mission for five years, returning in 1831. Tahtawi was appointed director of the School of Languages. At the school, he worked translating European books into Arabic. Tahtawi was instrumental in translating military manuals, geography, and European history. In total, al-Tahtawi supervised the translation of over 2,000 foreign works into Arabic. Al-Tahtawi even made favorable comments about French society in some of his books. Tahtawi stressed that the Principles of Islam are compatible with those of European Modernity.

In his piece, &quot;The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris,&quot; Tahtawi discusses the patriotic responsibility of citizenship. Tahtawi uses Roman civilization as an example for what could become of Islamic civilizations. At one point all Romans are united under one Caesar but split into East and West. After splitting, the two nations see “all its wars ended in defeat, and it retreated from a perfect existence to nonexistence.” Tahtawi understands that if Egypt is unable to remain united, it could fall prey to outside invaders. Tahtawi stresses the importance of citizens defending the patriotic duty of their country. One way to protect one&#x27;s country according to Tahtawi, is to accept the changes that come with a modern society.
Muhammad Abduh (1849 – 11 July 1905) was an Egyptian Islamic jurist, religious scholar and liberal reformer, regarded as one of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism, sometimes called Neo-Mu’tazilism. He broke the rigidity of the Muslim ritual, dogma, and family ties. He also wrote, among other things, &quot;Treatise on the Oneness of God&quot;, and a commentary on the Qur&#x27;an. Muhammad Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics, they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam man was not created to be led by a bridle, man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher&#x27;s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. He was against polygamy and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar&#x27;s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination and religious compulsion.

Muhammad Abduh claimed in his book &quot;Al-Idtihad fi Al-Nasraniyya wa Al-Islam&quot; that no one had exclusive religious authority in the Islamic world. He argued that the Caliph did not represent religious authority, because he was not infallible nor was the Caliph the person whom the revelation was given to; therefore, according to Abduh, the Caliph and other Muslims are equal. ʿAbduh argued that the Caliph should have the respect of the ummah but not rule it; the unity of the umma is a moral unity which does not prevent its division into national states.

Mohammad Abduh made great efforts to preach harmony between Sunnis and Shias. Broadly speaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. Abduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. As Christianity was the second biggest religion in Egypt, he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend Copts.

===British rule===
Egyptian self-government, education, and the conditions of Egypt&#x27;s peasant majority began to deteriorate under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation. Sheikh Muhammad Abduh, the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar Mufti, was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the modernist interpretations of Islam that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were Mustafa Kamil and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, &quot;If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.&quot;

Egyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 Dinshaway Incident, when following an altercation between a group of British officers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-colonial resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal &quot;Umma&quot; (the Nation, 1907) headed by Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, and the more radical, pro-Islamic &quot;Watani&quot; Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of Daqahliya in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi&#x27;s reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: &quot;El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.&quot;

Both the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British protectorate) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed and the People&#x27;s Party. Prominent among these was Saad Zaghlul who led the new movement through the Wafd Party. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as &#x27;Father of the Egyptians&#x27;. When on March 8, 1919, the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to Malta, the Egyptian people staged their first modern revolution. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.
Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed Pasha (15 January 1872 – 5 March 1963) was an Egyptian intellectual, anti-colonial activist and the first director of Cairo University. He was an influential person in the Egyptian nationalist movement and used his position in the media to strive and gain an independent Egypt from British rule. He was also one of the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism as well as the architect of Egyptian secularism and liberalism. He was fondly known as the &quot;Professor of the Generation&quot;. Lutfi was one of the fiercest opponents of pan-Arabism, insisting that Egyptians are Egyptians and not Arabs. He is considered one of the most influential scholars and intellectuals in the history of Egypt. Ahmed Lutfi al-Sayyid was an outright liberal and believed in equality and rights for all people. Lutfi&#x27;s contribution to Egypt in intellectual ideas and movements redefined history in Egypt. He was considered one of the first Egyptian officials to introduce Mill&#x27;s works and reading to the general Arab public so they could educate themselves on concepts of liberalism. He believed that people should have a say in what goes on in their government and country, and that all people had certain civil rights that could not be taken away. He was a staunch proponent of anti-colonialism and the negative effects it has on countries, which is what led to him being such an active member of the anti-British involvement in Egypt. He took a strong stance against the pan-Arabism view that was held at that time which emphasized a unification of all Arab countries and people into one entity. He believed that Egyptians were different from Arabs and had their own separate beliefs and cultural aspects.

===1923 Constitution===
The Wafd Party drafted a new Constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the Muslim Brotherhood and the radical Young Egypt Party. In 1920, Banque Misr (Bank of Egypt) was founded by Talaat Pasha Harb as &quot;an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only&quot;, which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.

===Notables of the liberal age===

Under the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa&#x27;a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to Muhammad Abduh and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, were Qasim Amin, Muhammad Husayn Haykal, Taha Hussein, Abbas el-&#x27;Akkad, Tawfiq el-Hakeem, and Salama Moussa. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, secularism, an evolutionary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.

In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as &quot;Mon Égypte&quot;, Naguib Mahfouz had this to say:

Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd (also Abu Zaid or Abu Zeid; July 10, 1943 – July 5, 2010) was an Egyptian Qur&#x27;anic thinker, author, academic and one of the leading liberal theologians in Islam. He is famous for his project of a humanistic Qur&#x27;anic hermeneutics, which &quot;challenged mainstream views&quot; on the Qur&#x27;an sparking &quot;controversy and debate.&quot; While not denying that the Qur&#x27;an was of divine origin, Zayd argued that it was a &quot;cultural product&quot; that had to be read in the context of the language and culture of seventh century Arabs, and could be interpreted in more than one way. He also criticized the use of religion to exert political power. In 1995 an Egyptian Sharia court declared him an apostate, this led to threats of death and his fleeing Egypt several week later. (He later &quot;quietly&quot; returned to Egypt where he died.) Abu Zayd&#x27;s critical approach to classical and contemporary Islamic discourse in the fields of theology, philosophy, law, politics, and humanism, promoted modern Islamic thought that might enable Muslims to build a bridge between their own tradition and the modern world of freedom of speech, equality (minority rights, women&#x27;s rights, social justice), human rights, democracy and globalisation.
Farag Foda (also Faraj Fawda; 1946 – 9 June 1992), was a prominent Egyptian professor, writer, columnist, and human rights activist. Foda felt that he was defending Islam against its distortion by Islamists, stating ‘Islam is a religion and Muslims are human beings; religion is blameless, while humans make mistakes’. After an Islamist periodical condemned as immoral the broadcast of the ballet Swan Lake on television, he argued that the problem lay with &quot;the onlooker (mushahid) rather than the looked upon (mushahad)&quot; and quoted passages from a 1979 book &quot;The Jurisprudence of Looking in Islam&quot;, which directs men to avoid looking at both women and males and, &quot;in particular, smooth-faced boys&quot;. In a column in &quot;October&quot; magazine, he lamented, &quot;the world around us is busy with the conquest of space, genetic engineering and the wonders of the computer,&quot; while Muslim scholars concern themselves with sex in paradise.
He was assassinated on 9 June 1992 by members of Islamist group al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya after being accused of blasphemy by a committee of clerics (&quot;ulama&quot;) at Al-Azhar University. In December 1992, his collected works were banned. In a statement claimed responsibility for the killing, Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya accused Foda of being an apostate from Islam, advocating the separation of religion from the state, and favouring the existing legal system in Egypt rather than the application of Sharia (Islamic law). The group explicitly referred to the Al-Azhar fatwā when claiming responsibility.

===After 2000===
Saad Eddin Ibrahim (born 3 December 1938) is an Egyptian American sociologist and author. He is one of Egypt&#x27;s leading human rights and democracy activists, and a strong critic of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. He is the founder of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in Cairo, the Arab Organization for Human Rights and the Arab Council of Childhood and Development.

==== El-Ghad Party ====

==== Democratic Front Party ====
The Democratic Front Party was liberal party founded in 2007 by Ahmed Diab and Yehia El Gamal. It was a full member of both the Liberal International and the Alliance of Democrats It merged with the Free Egyptians Party in December 2013.

==== April 6 Youth Movement ====

The April 6 Youth Movement &quot;()&quot; is an Egyptian activist group established in Spring 2008 to support the workers in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6.

Activists called on participants to wear black and stay home on the day of the strike. Bloggers and citizen journalists used Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, blogs and other new media tools to report on the strike, alert their networks about police activity, organize legal protection and draw attention to their efforts.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has identified the movement as the political Facebook group in Egypt with the most dynamic debates. , it had 70,000 predominantly young and educated members, most of whom had not been politically active before; their core concerns include free speech, nepotism in government and the country&#x27;s stagnant economy. Their discussion forum on Facebook features intense and heated discussions, and is constantly updated with new postings.

The April 6 movement is using the same raised fist symbol as the Otpor! movement from Serbia, that helped bring down the regime of Slobodan Milošević and whose nonviolent tactics were later used in Ukraine and Georgia. Mohammed Adel, a leader in the April 6 movement, studied at the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies, an organization founded by former Otpor! members. The movement was banned by an Egyptian court on 28 April 2014. The Constitution Party condemned the verdict, arguing that the charges against the movement were &quot;false&quot; and that the court ruling was an example of state institutions undermining and destroying the rule of law. Hamdeen Sabahi&#x27;s presidential campaign warned of the &quot;return to a state of suppression and banning.&quot; Abdul Ghaffar Shukr, vice president of the National Council for Human Rights, has stated that the council is prepared to stand in solidarity with the April 6 Youth Movement, and will aid the movement if it requests assistance. Human Rights Watch condemned the ruling as &quot;a clear violation of citizens’ rights to free association, peaceful assembly, and free expression.&quot; The April 6 movement has vowed to defy the ban, as well as attempt to repeal it.
Asmaa Mahfouz (born 1 February 1985) is an Egyptian activist and one of the founders of the April 6 Youth Movement. She has been credited by journalist Mona Eltahawy and others with helping to spark a mass uprising through her video blog posted one week before the start of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. She is a prominent member of Egypt&#x27;s Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution and one of the leaders of the Egyptian revolution.

==== Egyptian revolution of 2011 ====
The Egyptian revolution of 2011, locally known as the January 25 Revolution (; ), began on 25 January 2011 and took place across all of Egypt. It consisted of demonstrations, marches, occupations of plazas, riots, non-violent civil resistance, acts of civil disobedience and strikes. Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The revolution included Islamic, liberal, anti-capitalist, nationalist and feminist elements. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters burned over 90 police stations. The protests took place in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.

Following the 2011 Revolution and election of Muslim Brotherhood leader Muhammad Morsi to the presidency, the term &quot;liberal&quot; was used loosely in Egypt to refer to those who rallied around opposition to Morsi and the 2012 constitution. On November 22, 2012, Morsi had issued a decree granting himself &quot;extraordinary, unquestioned authority&quot;. He had also &quot;rammed&quot; a new constitution through the constitutional assembly which included &quot;expanded presidential powers, protections for the military, and a highly illiberal social agenda&quot;. The constitution was passed in a December 2012 referendum with low 33% turnout. This liberal bloc has been described as &quot;really a coalition between genuine liberals, socialists, and some of the less objectionable Mubarak loyalists&quot;, or as &quot;the flock of non-Islamist political parties and figures routinely lumped together as `liberals,` despite the fact that many of them have rejected any notion of political pluralism, a defining characteristic of liberalism.&quot;

==== Egyptian Social Democratic Party ====
The Egyptian Social Democratic Party is a social liberal and a social democratic party in Egypt. It was founded after the 2011 Egyptian Revolution by the merger of two minor liberal parties, the Liberal Egyptian Party, and the Egyptian Democratic Party on 29 March 2011.

Notable members include Mohamed Abou El-Ghar, film maker Daoud Abdel Sayed, activist Amr Hamzawy, Mervat Tallawy, former UN under-secretary and executive secretary of ESCWA, Hazem Al Beblawi, former executive secretary of the ESCWA and Ziad Bahaa El-Din. However, Amr Hamzawy resigned from the party in April to form the Freedom Egypt Party on 18 May 2011.

==== National Salvation Front ====
The National Salvation Front (also known as the National Front for Salvation of the Revolution or the National Rescue Front, ) is an alliance of Egyptian political parties, mainly secular and ranges from liberals to leftists, formed to defeat Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi&#x27;s 22 November 2012 constitutional declaration.

The front issued three demands to Morsi during the 2012 Egyptian protests. The demands were: that the constitutional declaration be rescinded, that the referendum be called off, and that a new constituent assembly be formed.

==== 2012–13 Egyptian protests ====

The 2012–13 Egyptian protests were part of a large scale popular uprising in Egypt against then-President Mohamed Morsi. On 22 November 2012, Protests began against Morsi, after his government announced a temporary constitutional declaration that in effect granted the president unlimited powers. Morsi deemed the decree necessary to protect the elected constituent assembly from a planned dissolution by judges appointed during the Mubarak era.

The demonstrations were organized by Egyptian opposition organizations and individuals, mainly liberals, leftists, secularists and Christians. The demonstrations resulted in violent clashes between Morsi-supporters and the anti-Morsi protesters, with dozens of deaths, hundreds of injuries and various cases of sexual assault against women during anti-Morsi demonstrations. Egypt Independent reported that one of the dead was Fathy Ghareeb, a founder of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, who died by suffocation caused by the tear gas fired by the Central Security Forces (CSF) in Tahrir Square. Demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace, which in turn was surrounded by tanks and armored vehicles of the Republican Guard. The anti-Morsi protesters in Cairo were estimated at 200,000, while over 100,000 supporters of Morsi gathered in Cairo to show support. A number of Morsi&#x27;s advisers resigned in protest, and many judges spoke out against his actions as well. Resignations were tendered by the director of state broadcasting, Rafik Habib (Christian vice president of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party), and Zaghloul el-Balshi (general secretary of the commission overseeing the planned constitutional referendum). Seven members of Morsi&#x27;s 17-member advisory panel resigned in December 2012.

==== Third Square ====

The Third Square () is an Egyptian political movement created by liberal, leftist and moderate Islamist activists who reject both Muslim Brotherhood and military rule following the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état. The movement first appeared when the Egyptian defence minister, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, called for mass demonstrations on 26 July 2013 to grant the military a &quot;mandate&quot; to crack down on &quot;terrorism&quot;, which was seen as contradicting the military&#x27;s pledges to hand over power to civilians after removing Morsi and as an indication for an imminent crackdown against Islamists. The announcement by General Al-Sisi was rejected by a number of political groups that had initially supported the military coup, such as the revolutionary April 6 Youth Movement, the moderate Strong Egypt Party, the Salafi Al-Nour Party and Egyptian human rights groups.

In response, &quot;The Third Square&quot;, a group of activists who mistrust both the military and the Islamists, called for a separate protest in Sphinx Square in Mohandessin, Cairo. One of the activists described the movement as &quot;a group of young people whose views are not represented either in Tahrir Square or Rabia Al-Adawiya&quot;, referring to the military-organised protests in Tahrir Square and the Islamist protests in Rabia Al-Adawiya square in Nasr City. In a leaflet, they declared their opposition to &quot;the defense minister calling for an authorization to kill Egyptians on the pretext of fighting terrorism&quot;.

Interviewed on the French television news channel France 24, activist Firas Mokhtar said: &quot;The Third Square is an attempt to bring Egyptians together and put an end to the polarisation of our society&quot;. Fellow activist and singer of Egyptian band Eskenderella, Samia Jahin, added: &quot;Maybe there&#x27;s only a few of us tonight. But soon you might hear of another group like ours in another square.&quot;

The movement is supported by intellectuals and artists such as the activist filmmaker Aalam Wassef, who released a music video showing him sitting out the demonstrations on 26 July at home, doing his laundry in front of a banner with the word &quot;Resist&quot;.

==== Free Egyptians Party ====
The Free Egyptians Party is an Egyptian liberal party, founded on 3 April 2011 after the 2011 Egyptian revolution. It supports the principles of a liberal, democratic, and secular political order in Egypt. Free Egyptians Party is the largest party in the House of Representatives.

Prominent party members include Naguib Sawiris, Farouk El-Baz, Ahmed Fouad Negm, Gamal El-Ghitani, Khaled Bichara, Mohamed Abu Hamed, Essam Khalil.

In March 2012, former deputy chairman and member of parliament Mohamed Abu Hamed resigned from the party to found Life of the Egyptians Party, and later with Ahmed Shafik the Egyptian Patriotic Movement.

==== Constitution Party ====
The Constitution Party () is a political party in Egypt. Founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohammad ElBaradei and a group of Egyptian intellectuals and activists on 28 April 2012, it aims to protect and promote the principles and objectives of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, according to liberal ideals. The Constitution Party &quot;aims to build a new Egypt based on democratic governance, education, competence, experience and the rule of law.&quot; Respect for human rights, advancing the Egyptian economy, providing for the basic needs of citizens, and advancing social equality are among the party&#x27;s primary goals. The principles of the party are summarized in its slogan, &quot;Bread, Freedom, and Social Justice.&quot;

Following the 2013 coup that overthrew Morsi, there was a shift in Egyptian public opinion away from Liberalism of the revolution towards &quot;an increasingly hardline, pro-military, anti-Islamist stance&quot;. The old liberal opposition became split between supporters of the coup (such as Tamarod), and liberals who thought the military crackdown – particularly the August 2013 raids on Brotherhood protest camps that killed hundreds – went too far (such as Mohamed ElBaradei). Opponents of Morsi who &quot;stood by the military as it ousted the president, but eventually broke away in the face of mounting state violence and mass arrests of Islamists under the guise of a `war on terror`”, became a minority attacked on state and private media.

Current liberal figures in Egypt include television comedian, Bassem Youssef, who has been attacked by television salafi shiekhs for their &quot;outlandish allegations&quot; against liberal protestors, and also opposed the crushing of the Muslim Brotherhood.

In the Mubarak and post-Mubarak era some of the contemporary Egyptian liberal parties are the Democratic Front Party (&quot;Hizb el-Gabha eldimocratia&quot;), the Tomorrow Party (&quot;Hisb el-Ghad&quot;), and the New Wafd Party (&quot;Hizb el-Wafd el-Gedid&quot;). The latest liberal party that came to prominence, &quot;Hizb El Ghad&quot;, was founded in November 2004. A split headed by its original founder, Ayman Nour, formed the Revolution&#x27;s Tomorrow Party (&quot;Ḥizb Ghad el-Thawra&quot;) in 2011. After the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 many liberal parties came out to light such as the Free Egyptians Party and the Egyptian Social Democratic Party.

<text>Ernest Frederick Beal VC (27 January 1883 – 22 March 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Beal was born to John J. W. and Jane Stillman Beal, who resided at 55, East St., Brighton.

==Military==
Beal was 35 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in 13th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 21/22 March 1918 at St-Léger, France.

==Commemoration==
Beal is commemorated on the Arras Memorial. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Green Howards Museum, Richmond, North Yorkshire, England. Two Brighton &amp; Hove buses have been named after him. Additionally, he is named on the panels commemorating the fallen from the First World War in the hall of Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College, for alumni of the preceding institution, Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School.

A gold locket containing Beale&#x27;s portrait and decorated with a Victoria Cross emblem was shown by his great-nephew, in an episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in December 2021.

<text>Progressivism is a major political movement in Taiwanese politics. There are several progressive political parties in Taiwan, but most are associated with the Pan-Green Coalition led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

== Progressive parties in Taiwan ==
The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is a centre-left social liberal and progressive party in Taiwan. It grew out of the Tangwai movement formed in the 1970s to oppose the ruling Kuomintang. As of the 2020 legislative elections, the DPP holds a majority of 61 legislative seats.

The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) is a left-wing progressive party characterised primarily by its Taiwanese nationalism and derives its membership from both the Kuomintang&#x27;s former moderate and Taiwan-oriented fringe and DPP supporters disgruntled by the party&#x27;s moderation on the question of Taiwanese sovereignty. Its progressive character is questionable, although it is part of the DPP&#x27;s pro-Taiwan independence Pan-Green alliance. The TSU lost all of its seats in the 2016 elections.

The New Power Party (NPP) is a progressive party which aims to rewrite the Constitution of Republic of China and to carry out Taiwanization. The NPP won three seats in the 2020 legislative election, but lost all the seats in 2024.

The modern liberal parties in Taiwan are mostly associated with Taiwanese nationalism, as well as liberal positions on social issues, such as support for LGBT rights and abolishing the death penalty. However, progressivism and social liberalism in Taiwan have not easily extended to extensive labor rights, or more liberal support for immigrant rights.

<doc id="1181167" wikidata="Q954811" url="?curid=1181167" title="Johan Gunnar Andersson">
<text>Johan Gunnar Andersson (3 July 1874 – 29 October 1960) was a Swedish archaeologist, geomorphologist, and paleontologist who was closely associated with the beginnings of Chinese archaeology in the 1920s.

==Early life and polar research==
After studies at Uppsala University, and research in the polar regions, Andersson served as Director of Sweden&#x27;s National Geological Survey.

He participated in the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1901 to 1903 (on the ship &quot;Antarctic&quot;).

His work on the Falkland Islands and the Bjørnøya, where he first coined the term solifluction, influenced Walery Łoziński&#x27;s creation of the concept of periglaciation in 1909.

==Chinese archaeology==
In 1914, Andersson was invited to China as a mining adviser to the Chinese government. His affiliation was with China&#x27;s National Geological Survey (Dizhi diaochasuo) which was organized and led by the Chinese scholar Ding Wenjiang (V.K. Ting) and his colleague Wong Wen-hao (Pinyin: Weng Wenhao). During this time, Andersson assisted in the training of China&#x27;s first generation of geologists, and he also made numerous discoveries of iron ore and other natural resources, as well as geological and paleontological discoveries.

Andersson paid his first visit to Zhoukoudian in 1918 drawn to an area called &quot;Chicken Bone Hill&quot; by locals who had misidentified the rodent fossils found in abundance there. He returned in 1921 and local quarrymen took him to &quot;Dragon Bone Hill&quot;, where he identified a quartz sample that was not native to the area. Realising that the presence of non-native quartz may indicate the presence of prehistoric man, he sent his assistant, Otto Zdansky to the area and ordered him to excavate it. Zdansky returned and conducted further excavations in 1923 and a large amount of material was shipped to Uppsala for analysis. Eventually in 1926, on the occasion of a visit by the Swedish Prince to Beijing, Andersson announced the discovery of two human teeth. These were later identified as being the first finds of the Peking Man.

In collaboration with Chinese colleagues such as Yuan Fuli and others, he then discovered prehistoric Neolithic remains in central China&#x27;s Henan Province, along the Yellow River. The remains were named the Yangshao culture after the village where they were first excavated, in 1921. This discovery was another extremely important breakthrough, because the prehistory of what is now China had not yet been investigated in scientific archaeological excavations and the Yangshao and other prehistoric cultures were completely unknown (they had never been mentioned in any historical documents, and they had never been recognized and investigated).

The decoration of Yangshao pottery was similar to the decoration of Anau and Tripolje pottery in Central Asia and Europe, and both of them have similar spiral patterns. Therefore, Andersson hypothesized that Chinese painted pottery could have spread from the west. He believed that the Ancient China and Central Asia could have passed through Xinjiang and Gansu regions.

In order to prove the hypothesis of a &quot;West Origin&quot;, Andersson, in his capacity as a staff member of China&#x27;s National Geological Survey, conducted archaeological excavations in the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai, in the following years, 1923–24, again in collaboration with his Chinese colleagues, and he published numerous books and scientific papers on Chinese archaeology, many in the &quot;Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities&quot;, which he founded and launched in 1929, and in it, he published his most significant scientific reports on his own work, including the book &quot;Preliminary Report on Archaeological Research in Kansu&quot; published in 1925.

Andersson&#x27;s archaeological activities and the view of Chinese culture which originated in the west caused a great uproar in China. The excavations by Chinese archaeologists, such as Li Ji, Fu Sinian, and Liang Siyong, based on their excavations in Yinxu and Chengziya, indicated an independent root for Chinese civilization. Despite this fact, it can be said that Andersson paved the way for the foundation of modern Chinese archaeology.

Andersson&#x27;s most well-known book about his time in China is &quot;Den gula jordens barn&quot;, 1932, translated into several languages, including English (as &quot;Children of the Yellow Earth&quot;, 1934, reprinted in 1973), Japanese, and Korean. For an extensive bibliography of Andersson&#x27;s works, and a comprehensive discussion of his and his colleagues&#x27; archaeological research in China, see M. Fiskesjö and Chen Xingcan, &quot;China before China: Johan Gunnar Andersson, Ding Wenjiang, and the Discovery of China&#x27;s Prehistory.&quot; Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities [Östasiatiska museet], 2004.

In 1926, Andersson founded the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm, Sweden (Swedish: &quot;Östasiatiska museet&quot;), a national museum established to house the Swedish part of the collections from these first-ever scientific archaeological excavations in China. Andersson served as the director of the MFEA until he was succeeded in 1939 by the famous Swedish Sinologist Bernhard Karlgren.

== Collection ==
Selections of the Swedish portion of the materials is on display at the MFEA in a new permanent exhibit launched 2004. The Chinese part of the Andersson collections, according to a bilateral Sino-Swedish agreement, was returned by him to the Chinese government in seven shipments, 1927–1936. The first shipments were sent by Andersson to Peking, and the last ones to Nanjing, which had become the new capital of China. An exhibit with these objects was mounted at the new National Geological Survey complex in Nanjing, where Andersson saw them in 1937, the last time they were reported seen by anyone. The last documentary evidence of these objects was a 1948 Visitors Guide to the Geological Survey museum in Nanjing, which listed Andersson&#x27;s Yangshao artefacts among the exhibits.

The objects were long thought to be irretrievably lost in the civil war that followed, until 2002. After major renovations at the Geological Museum of China, the successor to the Geological Survey&#x27;s museum, staff found three crates of ceramic vessels and fragments while re-organising items in storage. Following contact with the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities (Östasiatiska Museet) in Stockholm, it was confirmed that these were indeed left from Andersson&#x27;s excavations. In 2006, these objects featured in an exhibition at the Geological Museum on the occasion of its 90th anniversary, celebrating the lives and work of Andersson and its other founders. In 2007, the Geological Museum of China published a documentary film (see review and discussion in Fiskesjö 2010).

Still, as of 2010, the vast majority of the objects returned to China by Andersson remain lost. This includes a spectacular and unique human-faced ceramic shaman head (see illustration in Fiskesjö and Chen 2004, repeated in Fiskesjö 2010), and numerous spectacular painted ceramic vessels. Even though similar such ceramics have been excavated since Andersson&#x27;s time by Chinese archaeologists, these lost collections hold a special interest and value since they derive from the first scientific archaeological excavations in China. It is possible they remain in Nanjing, but despite investigations by several competent parties (Andersson&#x27;s sending lists have been copied by the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities to major institutions for cultural heritage and archaeology in China), they have not been relocated, and their whereabouts remains unknown.

<text>Sacsayhuamán ( ; ) or Saksaywaman (from Quechua , , ) is a citadel on the northern outskirts of the city of Cusco, Peru, the historic capital of the Inca Empire. The site is at an altitude of .

The complex was built by the Incas in the 15th century, particularly under Sapa Inca Pachacuti and his successors. Dry stone walls constructed of huge stones were built on the site, with the workers carefully cutting the boulders to fit them together tightly.

In 1983, Cusco and Sacsayhuamán together were designated as sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List, for international recognition and protection. The archeological site is now a tourist destination.

==Description==
Located on a steep hill that overlooks the city, the fortified complex has a wide view of the valley to the southeast. Archeological studies of surface collections of pottery at Sacsayhuamán indicate that the earliest occupation of the hilltop dates to about 900 CE.

According to Inca oral history, Tupac Inca 
&quot;remembered that his father Pachacuti had called city of Cuzco the lion city. He said that the tail was where the two rivers unite which flow through it, that the body was the great square and the houses round it, and that the head was wanting.&quot;The Inca decided the &quot;best head would be to make a fortress on a high plateau to the north of the city.&quot;

During the 15th century, the Imperial Inca expanded on this settlement, building dry stone walls constructed of huge stones. Spanish Chronicler Pedro Cieza de León wrote in 1553: 
The Inca ordered that the provinces should provide 20,000 men and that the villages should send the necessary provisions. If any fell sick, another labourer was to supply his place, and he was to return to his home. But these Indians were not kept constantly at a work in progress. They laboured for a limited time, and were then relieved by others, so that they did not feel the demand on their services. There were 4,000 labourers whose duty it was to quarry and get out the stones; 6,000 conveyed them by means of great cables of leather and of cabuya[202] to the works. The rest opened the ground and prepared the foundations, some being told off to cut the posts and beams for the wood-work. For their greater convenience, these labourers made their dwelling-huts, each lineage apart, near the place where the works were progressing. To this day most of the walls of these lodgings may be seen. Overseers were stationed to superintend, and there were great masters of the art of building who had been well instructed. Thus on the highest part of a hill to the north of the city, and little more than an arquebus-shot from it, this fortress was built which the natives called the House of the Sun, but which we named the Fortress.

The living rock was excavated for the foundation, which was prepared with such solidity that it will endure as long as the world itself. The work had, according to my estimate, a length of 330 paces,[203] and a width of 200. Its walls were so strong that there is no artillery which could breach them. The principal entrance was a thing worthy of contemplation, to see how well it was built, and how the walls were arranged so that one commanded the other. And in these walls there were stones so large and mighty that it tired the judgment to conceive how they could have been conveyed and placed, and who could have had sufficient power to shape them, seeing that among these people there are so few tools. Some of these stones are of a width of twelve feet and more than twenty long, others are thicker than a bullock.[204] All the stones are laid and joined with such delicacy that a rial could not be put in between two of them.

I went to see this edifice twice. On one occasion I was accompanied by Tomas Vasquez,[205] a conqueror, and on the other I found Hernando de Guzman there, he who was present at the siege,[206] and Juan de la Haya.[207] Those who read this should believe that I relate nothing that I did not see. As I walked about, observing what was to be seen, I beheld, near the fortress, a stone which measured 260 of my palmos in circuit, and so high that it looked as if it was in its original position. All the Indians say that the stone got tired at this point, and that they were unable to move it further.[208] Assuredly if I had not myself seen that the stone had been hewn and shaped I should not have believed, however much it might have been asserted, that the force of man would have sufficed to bring it to where it now is. There it remains, as a testimony of what manner of men those were who conceived so good a work. The Spaniards have so pillaged and ruined it, that I should be sorry to have been guilty of the fault of those in power who have permitted so magnificent a work to be so ruined. They have not considered the time to come, for it would have been better to have preserved the edifice and to have put a guard over it.[209]

There were many buildings within the fortress, some small, one over the other, and others, which were large, were underground. They made two blocks of buildings, one larger than the other, wide and so well-built, that I know not how I can exaggerate the art with which the stones are laid and worked; and they say that the subterranean edifices are even better. Other things were told me, which I do not repeat, because I am not certain of their accuracy. This fortress was commenced in the time of Ynca Yupanqui. His son, Tupac Inca, as well as Huayna Ccapac and Huascar, worked much at it, and although it is still worthy of admiration, it was formerly without comparison grander. When the Spaniards entered Cuzco, the Indians of Quizquiz had already collected great treasure; but some was still found, and it is believed that there is a great quantity in the vicinity. It would be well to give orders for the preservation of what is left of this fortress, and of that of Huarcu,[210] as memorials of the grandeur of this people, and even for utility, as they could be made serviceable at so little cost.

After ambushing Atahualpa during the Spanish Conquest of Peru, Francisco Pizarro sent Martin Bueno and two other Spaniards to help transport gold and silver from the Temple of Coricancha in Cusco to Cajamarca, where the Spaniards were based. They found the Temple of the Sun &quot;covered with plates of gold&quot;, which the Spanish supposedly ordered removed as payment for Atahualpa&#x27;s ransom. Seven hundred plates were removed, and added to two hundred &quot;cargas&quot; of gold transported back to Cajamarca.

After Francisco Pizarro finally entered Cuzco, Pedro Pizarro described what they found, 
&quot;on top of a hill they [the Inca] had a very strong fort surrounded with masonry walls of stones and having two very high round towers. And in the lower part of this wall there were stones so large and thick that it seemed impossible that human hands could have set them in place...they were so close together, and so well fitted, that the point of a pin could not have been inserted in one of the joints. The whole fortress was built up in terraces and flat spaces.&quot; The numerous rooms were &quot;filled with arms, lances, arrows, darts, clubs, bucklers and large oblong shields...there were many morions...there were also...certain stretchers in which the Lords travelled, as in litters.&quot; Pedro Pizarro described in detail storage rooms that were within the complex and filled with military equipment.

The large plaza, capable of holding thousands of people, was designed for communal ceremonial activities. Several of the large structures at the site may also have been used during rituals. A similar relationship to that between Cuzco and Sacsayhuamán was replicated by the Inca in their distant colony where Santiago, Chile developed. The Inca fortress there, known as Chena, predated the Spanish colonial city. It was a ceremonial ritual site known as Huaca de Chena.

The best-known zone of Sacsayhuamán includes its great plaza and its adjacent three massive terrace walls. The stones used in the construction of these terraces are among the largest used in any building in pre-Hispanic America. They display a precision of cutting and fitting that is unmatched in the Americas. The stones are so closely spaced that a single piece of paper will not fit between many of the stones. This precision, combined with the rounded corners of the blocks, the variety of their interlocking shapes, and the way the walls lean inward, is thought to have helped the ruins survive devastating earthquakes in Cuzco. The longest of the three walls is about 400 meters. They are about 6 meters tall. The estimated volume of stone is over 6,000 cubic meters. Estimates for the weight of the largest Limestone block vary from 128 tonnes to almost 200 tonnes. These stones were moved an estimated 35 km (22 miles) from Rumicolca. 
Following the siege of Cusco, the Spaniards began to use Sacsayhuamán as a source of stones for building Spanish Cuzco; within a few years, they had taken apart and demolished much of the complex. The site was destroyed block by block to salvage materials with which to build the new Spanish governmental and religious buildings of the colonial city, as well as the houses of the wealthiest Spaniards. In the words of Garcilaso de la Vega (1966:471 [1609: Part 1, Book. Bk. 7, Ch. 29]): 
&quot;to save themselves the expense, effort and delay with which the Indians worked the stone, they pulled down all the smooth masonry in the walls. There is indeed not a house in the city that has not been made of this stone, or at least the houses built by the Spaniards.&quot;Today, only the stones that were too large to be easily moved remain at the site.

On 13 March 2008, archaeologists discovered additional ruins at the periphery of Sacsayhuamán. It has been theorized that the site was first built upon during the Killke period, which preceded the Inca. While appearing ceremonial in nature, the exact function remains unknown.

In January 2010, parts of the site were damaged during periods of heavy rainfall in the region.

==Theories about constructing the megalithic walls==

Vince Lee is an author, architect and explorer who has been consulted on various ancient sites that moved large megaliths. He theorized that the blocks were put into place by carving them first and then lowering them into place. This would have involved doing precise carving ahead of time to create the tight joints that are made to fit into prepared pockets existing in the wall. Then they would be towed up a ramp and above the wall where they would be placed on top of a stack of logs. Then the logs would be removed 1 at a time to lower the stones into place carefully. An experiment was done to see if this would work on a small scale; this accomplished limited success. In the event that they were unable to obtain the tight joints the first time the Incas would also have been able to lift the stones back up to correct their mistakes. They were not able to obtain as much precision as the Incas but they theorized that with more practice they could have accomplished more precise joints and done it with larger stones.

They also did several experiments in nearby Ollantaytambo to tow megalithic stones. This also led to limited success. They conducted one experiment where they tried to lower a 1 ton stone down a mountain. They lost control of this stone and it rolled down on its own. This is probably not the way the Incas did it since they would have wanted to control the transportation and this could have led to a lot of accidents. They concluded that although they had gravity on their side they had to practice to maintain control of the descent. They also did an experiment towing a megalith that may have been close to 10 tons on cobblestones. They had about 12 people behind the megalith pushing it while well over 100 people were pulling on several ropes to tow it. They succeeded in towing it at a fairly quick pace. The ancient Incas built a large road system that included 25,000 km of roads. Some of these roads were embellished with stone pavings. Additional experiments were done at other locations to move large megaliths some of which are listed here; these experiments were not adequate to replicate the successful efforts Pedro Cieza de León claimed to witness in the 16th century, and the largest megaliths currently there were more than twice his estimates of the largest 
megaliths in his time. 

==Modern-day use==
Peruvians continue to celebrate &quot;Inti Raymi&quot;, the annual Inca festival of the winter solstice and new year. It is held near Sacsayhuamán on 24 June. Another important festival is &quot;Warachikuy,&quot; held there annually on the third Sunday of September.

Some people from Cusco use the large field within the walls of the complex for jogging, tai chi, and other athletic activities.

<text>Robert Matthew Beatham, VC (16 June 1894 – 11 August 1918) was a British-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He saw action in the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War and fell at the Battle of Amiens.

== Early life ==
Beatham was born on 16 June 1894 to John and Elizabeth Beatham, who resided at Glassonby, Cumberland, England. He was educated at a local school and as a teenager, he emigrated to Australia with his brother Walter. He was labouring at Geelong in Victoria when he volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force on 8 January 1915.

== First World War ==
Beatham was posted to the 8th Battalion with the rank of private. He embarked on HMAT &quot;Hororata&quot; from Melbourne on 17 April 1915 for Suez but returned to Australia in August 1915 due to venereal disease. After recuperating he embarked for Gallipoli as a reinforcement for 8th Battalion. He saw nearly a month of active service at Gallipoli before the general evacuation to Alexandria.

From there Beatham was sent to France, arriving with his battalion in Marseilles on 31 March 1916 en route for the Western Front. Later that year he participated in the Battle of Pozières during which he was wounded. After six weeks of recuperation he rejoined his unit in late September 1917. He was wounded a second time on 4 October 1917 at Broodseinde during the Battle of Passchendaele and was evacuated to England for treatment and recovery. During his sojourn in England he was found guilty of being absent without leave over the New Year of 1918 and was given field punishment and a forfeit of pay. He rejoined his unit in February 1918.

Beatham was a member of &#x27;A&#x27; Coy of 8th Battalion. On 9 August 1918 at Rosières, east of Amiens, on the second day of the Battle of Amiens, Beatham&#x27;s battalion was attacking high ground when it was held up by heavy machine gun fire after supporting armour was knocked out of action. Beatham, accompanied by Lance Corporal W. G. Nottingham, made four charges to knock out a series of German machine gun posts holding back the advance of the Australians. Wounded in the leg during the first charge, he was killed taking out a final machine gun post on 11 August. For his gallantry he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). Gazetted on 14 December 1918, the citation for his VC read as follows:

Beatham is buried at Heath Cemetery, in Harbonnières. His Victoria Cross is held in a private collection in Melbourne. It sold in 1999 for a then record price for an Australian VC of A$178,500.

Six of his brothers saw active service in the First World War; three died and another spent two years as a prisoner of war. Robert&#x27;s younger brother Walter also enlisted in the AIF and served with 21st Battalion and survived the war.

<text>GT.M is a high-throughput key–value database engine optimized for transaction processing. (It is a type also referred to as &quot;schema-less&quot;, &quot;schema-free&quot;, or &quot;NoSQL&quot;.) GT.M is also an application development platform and a compiler for the ISO standard M language, also known as MUMPS.

GT.M, an abbreviation for &quot;Greystone Technology M,&quot; was developed by the Greystone Technology Corp in the 1980s. It is an implementation of ANSI standard M for AIX and Linux. In addition to preserving the traditional features of M, GT.M also offers an optimizing compiler that produces object code that does not require internal interpreters during execution.

The database engine, made open source in 2000, is maintained by FIS. GT.M is used as the backend of their &quot;FIS Profile&quot; banking application, and it powers banks in Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and India; Capital One 360 in the United States; Tangerine (Scotiabank) in Canada; Atom Bank; Tandem Bank; Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank; Scottish Widows and Barclays Direct in the UK. It is also used as an open source backend for the Electronic Health Record system WorldVistA and other open source EHRs such as Medsphere&#x27;s OpenVista. It is listed as an open source healthcare solution partner of Red Hat. It consists of approximately 2 million lines of code.

== Technical overview ==

GT.M consists of a language subsystem, a database subsystem, and utility programs. The language subsystem and database subsystem are closely integrated, but each is usable without the other. The language and database subsystems share common data organization and typing.

=== Data organization and typing ===
Like MUMPS, GT.M has no real concept of different data types, though strings (those which are not fully numeric) must be placed in quotes to differentiate them from variables. Numbers can be treated as strings of digits, or strings can be treated as numbers by numeric operators (coerced, in MUMPS terminology). Data is treated based on context and the rules of GT.M: codice_1 yields the result codice_2, the first character of codice_2 is codice_4, and codice_5 is codice_6 (as non-numeric characters are dropped during numeric operations).

There is only one data structure - multi-dimensional sparse arrays (key-value nodes, sub-trees, and associative memory are all equally valid descriptions) with up to 32 subscripts. A scalar can be thought of as an array element with zero subscripts. Nodes with varying numbers of subscripts (including one node with no subscripts) can freely co-exist in the same array. For example, if one wanted to represent the national capitals of the United States:
Variables are created on demand when first assigned to. Thus, the first Set command above would create the variable codice_7. Variables have scope in the language, and are called &quot;local variables&quot;. A database access looks like an array access, for example:

but the caret (^) means that it is a database access. Variables used for database access have a single global scope, and of course persist and shared between processes. They are called &quot;global variables&quot;. The first 31 characters of a variable name are significant.

The Kill and ZKill commands are used to delete subtrees of values.

GT.M uses Unicode (ISO/IEC-10646) for international character set support.

=== Database subsystem ===
The &quot;logical database&quot; of a GT.M process consists of one or more &quot;global variable name spaces&quot;, each consisting of unlimited number of global variables. For each global variable name space, a &quot;global directory&quot; maps global variables to the database files where they actually reside. An unlimited number of global variables can fit within one database file; a global variable must fit in one database file.

A database file consists of up to 224M (276,168,704) database blocks. A database block is a multiple of 512 bytes, with a maximum size of 65,024 bytes. Commonly used block sizes are 4KB, 8KB and 16KB - so, with an 8KB block size, an individual global variable can grow to 1,792GB. A global variable node (global variable, subscripts plus value) must fit in one database block and each block has a 16 byte overhead. So, the largest node that will fit in a database with a 4KB block size is 4,080 bytes. A key (global variable plus subscripts) can be up to 255 bytes.

The database engine is daemonless and processes accessing the database operate with normal user and group ids - a process has access to a database file if and only if the ownership and permissions of that database file (plus any layered access control such as SELinux) permits access. Each process has within its address space all the logic needed to manage the database, and processes cooperate with one another to manage database files. When a database file is journaled, updates are written to journal files before being written to database files, and in the event of a system crash, database files can be recovered from journal files.

The database engine also supports transaction processing. So, code such as:
 TStart ()
 Set ^Capital(&quot;France&quot;)=&quot;Paris&quot;
 Set ^Country(&quot;Paris&quot;)=&quot;France&quot;
 TCommit

implements an ACID transaction. GT.M uses optimistic concurrency control to manage transactions.

A plug-in architecture allows the database to be encrypted in order to protect data at rest. GT.M is distributed with a reference plug-in that uses GnuPG.

=== Language subsystem ===

Unlike the database where global variable nodes must fit within a database block, local variable strings can grow to 1MB. The GT.M run-time provides dynamic storage allocation with garbage collection. The number of local variables and the number of nodes in local variables are limited only by storage available to the process. The default scope of a local variable is the lifetime of a process. Local variables created within routines using the New command have more limited scope.

GT.M routines are dynamically compiled and linked for execution in the address space of each process. With the exception of the 32-bit implementation of GT.M for the x86 Linux platform, object modules can also be placed in shared libraries with the standard codice_8 command, in which case the memory used is shared. This is important because an application such as VistA has over 20,000 routines whose compiled object code exceeds 200MB. A large hospital running VistA can have thousands of concurrently running user processes.

With a couple of small exceptions, GT.M includes a nearly complete implementation of ISO standard M (affectionately known as MUMPS for historical reasons).

In GT.M, M code can freely call out to C code (or code in other languages with a C compatible interface), and C code can freely call in to M code (so the top level program can be a C codice_9). For example, is a GT.M module in CPAN, m_python for access from Python or EGTM binding for Erlang.

Web services written in GT.M can be deployed under an Internet super server such as inetd or xinetd. Web-enabled applications can use layered software such as EWD or CFMumps.

== Platforms ==
GT.M is fully supported on the following platforms:
*AIX on IBM System p
*Linux on x86_64 and IA-32 (x86) architectures. The YottaDB fork of GT.M adds support for ARM.

GT.M is no longer supported on these platforms:
* HP-UX as of October 2015 (V6.2-002A)
* OpenVMS as of December 2014 (V6.2-001)
* Solaris as of December 2015 (V6.2-002A)

The code base for GT.M on Linux on IA-32 (x86) includes changes needed to run on Cygwin on Microsoft Windows but this is not a supported platform.

== Licensing ==

On Linux on x86-64 &amp; IA-32 (x86), and on OpenVMS on Alpha/AXP, GT.M is released as Free / Open Source Software (FOSS) under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3. On other platforms, it is available under proprietary licenses.

== Common applications ==
GT.M is predominantly used in healthcare and financial services industry. The first production use of GT.M was in 1986 at the Elvis Presley Memorial Trauma Center in Memphis, Tennessee. Through &quot;FIS Profile&quot;, it powers banks in the United States, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, Vietnam, and Thailand.

SQL and ODBC access to GT.M databases exists as separate commercial products.

<text>Louis Marie de Noailles, [[Viscount]] of Noailles (17 April 1756 Paris7 January 1804 Havana) was the second son of Philippe, duc de Mouchy, and a member of Mouchy branch of the famous Noailles family of the French aristocracy.

==Career==
He served under his brother-in-law the Marquis de Lafayette in America during the American War for Independence, and was the officer who concluded the capitulation of Yorktown in 1781.

He was elected to the Estates-General in 1789. On 4 August 1789, during the French Revolution, he began the famous &quot;orgy&quot; (as Mirabeau called it) when feudalism was to be abolished, and the Duc d&#x27;Aiguilion proposed the abolition of titles and liveries in June 1790.
As the French Revolution progressed and became more dangerous for nobles, he emigrated to the United States and became a partner in William Bingham&#x27;s Bank of North America in Philadelphia. He was successful in the United States. He accepted a command against the English in San Domingo, under Rochambeau. He commanded a defence of the Môle-Saint-Nicolas and escaped with the garrison to Cuba, but &quot;en route&quot; there his ship was attacked by a British schooner. After a long engagement, he was severely wounded, and died of his wounds in Havana on 9 January 1804.

Louis Marie Antoine de Noailles was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati from France.

==Personal life==
He married his cousin Anne Jeanne Baptiste de Noailles (1758–1794), daughter of Jean Louis Paul François de Noailles, Duke of Noailles. They had four children:

# Adrienne Theodore Philippine de Noailles (1778–1781), who died young.
# Louis Joseph Alexis de Noailles, Count of Noailles(1783–1835), who married Cécile de Boisgelin (1797-1836), the only child of Marquis Bruno-Gabriel de Boisgelin and Cécile d&#x27;Harcourt-Beuvron.
# Alfred Louis Dominique Vincent de Paul de Noailles, Viscount of Noailles (1784–1812) married Rosalie Charlotte Antoinette Léontine de Noailles (1797–1851), daughter of Charles Arthur Tristan Languedoc de Noailles.
# Euphemia Cécile Marie Adelaide de Noailles (1790–1870), who married Olivier de Saint-Georges de Vérac, Marquis of Vérac (1768–1858), in 1811.

Noailles died in Havana on 9 January 1804.

===Descendants===
Through his son Alfred, Viscount de Noailles, he was a grandfather of Anne Marie Cécile de Noailles (1812–1848), who married Charles Philippe Henri de Noailles.

Through his daughter Euphemia, he was a grandfather of Marthe Augustine de Saint-Georges de Vérac, who married Louis Marie Pantaleon Costa, Marquis de Beauregard (1806–1864) in 1834.

<text>Stardust William David Blumenfeld Doherty (né Will Doherty) is the former executive director of the Verified Voting Foundation and VerifiedVoting.org and was the originator of the Election Incident Reporting System, used to detect over 40,000 problems with the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election and to ensure that all legally qualified voters would have the opportunity to vote.

A Los Angeles Times article by Ralph Vartabedian reported on November 4, 2004: &quot;&#x27;We saw systematic problems throughout the U.S.,&#x27; said Will Doherty, executive director of VerifiedVoting.org, a group that is calling for every electronic voting machine to produce a paper trail that can be audited.&quot;

Doherty appeared on the Brian Lehrer Show of December 8, 2004 with the following description: &quot;Will Doherty, Executive Director of Verified Voting Foundation, says there were widespread problems with electronic voting, but stops short of claiming fraud.&quot;

Doherty previously held position as Online Activist and Media Relations Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

He founded the Online Policy Group (OPG), a free speech Internet Service Provider (ISP) that initiated a lawsuit against election systems manufacturer Diebold Systems, Inc., to prevent the company&#x27;s attempt to stifle discussion of an email archive demonstrating flaws with Diebold election equipment and potential problems with use of uncertified portions of Diebold election machines in actual elections.

Doherty and interns from the Online Policy Group and the Electronic Frontier Foundation conducted a study on Internet blocking (or filtering) technology that was later used in an amicus curiae brief before the U.S. Supreme Court in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act.

Doherty also served as Director of Online Community Development at the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Doherty holds an M.B.A. from Golden Gate University and a B.S. in Computer Science and Writing from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

<text>The DShK M1938 (Cyrillic: ДШК, for ) is a Soviet heavy machine gun. The weapon may be vehicle mounted or used on a tripod or wheeled carriage as a heavy infantry machine gun. The DShK&#x27;s name is derived from its original designer, Vasily Degtyaryov, and Georgi Shpagin, who later improved the cartridge feed mechanism. It is sometimes nicknamed Dushka (a dear or beloved person) in Russian-speaking countries, from the abbreviation.

== Specifications ==
The DShK is a belt-fed machine gun firing the 12.7×108mm cartridge, and uses a butterfly trigger. Firing at 600 rounds per minute, it has an effective range of , and can penetrate up to 20 mm of armor up to a range of 500 m. The DShK has two &quot;spider web&quot; ring sights for use against aircraft. It is used by infantry on tripod mounts or deployed with a two-wheeled mounting and a single-sheet armor-plate shield. It is also mounted on tanks and armored vehicles for use against infantry and aircraft; nearly all Russian-designed tanks prior to the T-64 use the DShK.

== History ==
Requiring a heavy machine gun similar to the M2 Browning, development of the DShK began in the Soviet Union in 1929 and the first design was finalised by Vasily Degtyaryov in 1931. The initial design used the same gas operation from the Degtyaryov machine gun, and used a 30 round drum magazine, but had a poor rate of fire. Georgy Shpagin revised the design by changing it to a belt-fed with a rotary-feed cylinder, and the new machine gun began production in 1938 as the DShK 1938. The DShK and the American M2 Browning are the only .50 caliber machine guns designed prior to World War II that remain in service to the present day.

During World War II, the DShK was used by the Red Army, with a total of 9,000 produced during the war. It was used mostly in anti-aircraft roles on vehicles such as the GAZ-AA truck, IS-2 tank, ISU-152 self-propelled artillery, and the T-40 amphibious tank. Similar to the PM M1910 Maxim, when deployed against infantry, the DShK was used with a two-wheeled trolley, with which the machine gun weighed a total of . In 1944, a much cheaper muzzle brake patterned after the Polish Wz. 35 anti-tank rifle was introduced instead of the complicated early design. After 1945, the DShK was exported widely to other countries in the Eastern Bloc.

In 1946, an improved variant was produced, with a revised muzzle and feeding system. Named the DShK 38/46 or DShK-M, over a million were produced from 1946-1980. The gun was also revised to become more reliable, and easier to manufacture. The new DShK was produced under license in Pakistan, Iran, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak variant, most often encountered on quads, is visually distinguishable by a rectangular muzzle brake. China produced their own variant of the design, designated the Type 54.

After World War II, DShKs were used widely by communist forces in Vietnam, starting with the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. While not as powerful as anti-aircraft cannons, the DShK was easier to smuggle through Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. DShKs were a major threat to American aircraft in the Vietnam War, and of the 7,500 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft lost during the war, most were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns including DShK.

In June 1988, during The Troubles, a British Army Westland Lynx helicopter was hit 15 times by two Provisional IRA DShKs smuggled from Libya, and forced to crash-land near Cashel Lough Upper, south County Armagh.

Rebel forces utilized DShKs in the Syrian civil war, often mounting the gun on cars. In 2012, the Syrian government claimed to have destroyed 40 such technicals on a highway in Aleppo and six in Dael.

The DShK began to be partially replaced in the Soviet Union by the NSV machine gun in 1971, and the Kord machine gun in 1998. The DShK remains in service, although it is no longer produced.

The weapon was used by Ukrainian forces in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to shoot down Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones. The DShKs are fitted with a searchlight when attacking drones, which MANPADS have been unable to destroy. As many of the DShKs have been left over from the Soviet Union, they have been both cost-effective and one of the most reliable methods of destroying drones.

<text>Captain Stephen Halden Beattie VC (29 March 1908 – 20 April 1975) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Beattie was born at Leighton, Montgomeryshire to Rev. Prebendary Ernest Halden Beattie, MC and Ethel Knowles. He was educated at Abberley Hall School in Worcester. He joined the Royal Navy in 1925 as a Special Entry Cadet.

Then-Lt Cdr Beattie, a 33-year-old in command of the Royal Navy destroyer HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, the tactical lynchpin of the St Nazaire Raid in 1942, was awarded the VC, recognized as being:
After grounding the ship, filled with hidden explosives which detonated the next day, successfully ruining Saint-Nazaire as a port for the Nazi Navy, Beattie was taken prisoner of war by the Germans. He spent the first part of his captivity in Frontstalag 133 at Rennes in France before being transferred to Marlag und Milag Nord, the POW camp for Royal Navy and Merchant Navy prisoners, near Bremen. He was notified of the award while in captivity, during a special parade at the camp. He remained in captivity until 10 April 1945 when, as part of a prisoner of war column evacuated from the prison camp by the Germans, he was liberated at Lübeck. He was later mentioned in despatches for his gallant bearing in captivity.

In 1947 Beattie received the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;. He later achieved the rank of captain and served as Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf from April 1956 to April 1958. His last appointment circa 1957-60 was Commanding Officer HMS Birmingham and Flag Captain to Flag Officer, Flotillas, Home Fleet. He retired from the navy in July 1960. Later in the mid-1960s he was naval adviser to the Ethiopian government.

He died at Mullion, Cornwall. He is buried at Ruan Minor Churchyard in Helston, Cornwall, United Kingdom.
In September 2023, a memorial tablet was dedicated to his memory by the Bishop of Hereford at his birthplace&#x27;s parish church in Leighton.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, England.

<text>The Anaheim Splash was a U.S. indoor soccer team that played in the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL). It was founded in 1992 as the Los Angeles United, but was sold after the season. The new ownership moved the team to Anaheim, California and renamed it the Anaheim Splash. The team folded in 1997, along with the CISL.

==Los Angeles United==
In the fall of 1992, Jerry Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, was instrumental in the founding of the CISL. On August 19, 1992, he was awarded a franchise named Los Angeles United. The team played in the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California, which was also owned by Buss. The team went 6–22, drawing an average of less than 2,000 fans per game. At the end of the season, Buss sold the team to Ogden Facility Management.

When Ogden Facility Management purchased Los Angeles United, they moved the team to the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim and renamed the team the Anaheim Splash to capitalize on the name of the team’s arena. The team saw an immediate turn around on the field, going 20–8 and losing to the Las Vegas Dustdevils in the playoff semifinals. In 1995, the CISL rearranged the teams, moving Anaheim to the Southern Division. Anaheim again won the division title before losing in the semifinals, this time to the Sacramento Knights. In 1996, the league began losing teams, leading to another readjustment of the teams, with the Splash returning to the Western Division, placing second in the division, but losing to the quarterfinals. In 1997, the Splash again finished second in the division, but lost in the second round to the Sacramento Knights. The CISL and Anaheim Splash both folded on December 23, 1997. During its four seasons in Anaheim, the Splash averaged 6,393 per game. The Splash also averaged 6,822 per game in the playoffs.

<doc id="1181241" wikidata="Q2457755" url="?curid=1181241" title="Book of Aneirin">
<text>The Book of Aneirin () is a late 13th century Welsh manuscript containing Old and Middle Welsh poetry attributed to the late 6th century Northern Brythonic poet, Aneirin, who is believed to have lived in present-day Scotland.

The manuscript is kept at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. It is made of parchment and was written in Wales around 1265, probably in a monastery, but is probably a copy of a lost 9th century original. The text of the manuscript is rendered in a proto-gothic hand. There is minimal decoration, consisting of only of a few colored Lombardic Capitals. Paragraphs are broken by similarly colored pilcrows and where the text breaks before the right margin, simple illustrated linear termini are provided. 

The poetry recorded in the book, which has only 38 pages, would previously have been kept alive through oral tradition. The best-known poem contained within its pages is &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, an early Welsh-language poem commemorating the warriors from Gododdin (Lothian in modern Scotland) who fell at the Battle of Catraeth (probably Catterick in North Yorkshire) around the year 600. Parts of this do appear to be contemporary with Aneirin, who, it is claimed, was a survivor of the battle. Military activities are described in great detail in the poem.

The other poetry, with no connection to this battle, includes, amongst others, &quot;Peis Dinogat&quot;, a short poem for a child named Dinogad, in the form of a lullaby, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing. The literary scholar, Sir Ifor Williams, suggested that its incongruous presence within the Book of Aneirin might have been the result of it having been written in the margin of the original manuscript.

The other works in the volume are an elegy to a victim of a massacre, and &quot;The true verses of Gorchan Adrefon and Gorchan Maeldderw&quot;, which is attributed to the poet Taliesin. Sir Ifor Williams proposed that the contents of the manuscript demonstrate that the Welsh language was spoken in northern parts of the British Isles.

During the 15th century, the poet Dafydd Nanmor owned the manuscript, and it later passed into the hands of Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt, a well-known collector. It remained in the Hengwrt collection until the 1780s, when it was stolen. Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc) later acquired it and, following his death in 1848, it was bought by another collector, Sir Thomas Phillipps, 1st Baronet. In 1896 it was bought by Cardiff Free Library and thus passed to the National Library of Wales, where it has been restored and rebound.

<text>The 12.7×108mm cartridge is a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and anti-materiel rifle cartridge used by the former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries, including Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and many others. It was invented in 1934 to create a cartridge like the German 13.2mm TuF anti-tank rifle round and the American .50 Browning Machine Gun round (12.7×99mm NATO). 

It is used in the same roles as the NATO .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) cartridge. The two differ in bullet shape and weight, and the casing of the 12.7 × 108 mm is slightly longer, and its larger case capacity allows it to hold slightly more of a different type of powder. The 12.7 × 108 mm can be used to engage a wide variety of targets on the battlefield, and will destroy unarmored vehicles, penetrate lightly armored vehicles and damage external ancillary equipment (i.e.: searchlights, radar, transmitters, vision blocks, engine compartment covers) on heavily armored vehicles such as tanks. It will also ignite gasoline and—since 2019—diesel fuel (experimental &quot;Avers&quot; AP/I round).

==Cartridge dimensions==
The 12.7 × 108 mm has 22.72 ml (350 grains) H2O cartridge case capacity.

12.7 × 108 mm maximum cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 18.16 degrees.

According to guidelines the 12.7 × 108 mm case can handle up to 360 MPa (52,213 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify for sale to consumers.

<doc id="1181258" wikidata="Q1761551" url="?curid=1181258" title="Taquile Island">
<text>Taquile (, ; ) is an island on the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca 45 km offshore from the city of Puno. About 2,200 people live on the island, which is in size (maximum measurements), with an area of . The highest point of the island is above sea level and the main village is at . The inhabitants, known as &quot;Taquileños&quot;, speak Puno Quechua.

In 2005, &quot;Taquile and Its Textile Art&quot; were honored by being proclaimed &quot;Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot; by UNESCO.

== Textiles ==
Taquileños are known for their fine handwoven textiles and clothing, which are regarded as among the highest-quality handicrafts in Peru. Knitting is exclusively performed by males, beginning in early boyhood. Women spin wool and use vegetables and minerals to dye the wool to be used by the community. Women are also the weavers of the Chumpis, the wide belts with woven designs worn by everyone in the community of Taquile.

== Tourism ==

Taquileans are known for having created an innovative, community-controlled sustainable tourism model, offering home stays, transportation, lodging for groups, cultural activities, local guides and restaurants. Ever since tourism started coming to Taquile in the 1970s, the Taquileans slowly lost control over the mass day-tourism operated by non-Taquileans. Taquile community have their own Travel Agency Munay Taquile has been established to regain local control over tourism.

==Climate==

== Society and economy ==
Taquileños run their society based on community collectivism and on the Inca moral code &quot;ama sua, ama llulla, ama qhilla&quot;, (Quechua for &quot;do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy&quot;). The island is divided into six sectors or &quot;suyus&quot; for crop rotation purposes. The economy is based on fishing, terraced farming horticulture based on potato cultivation and tourist-generated income from the approximately 40,000 tourists who visit each year. Taquile&#x27;s families own rams, sheep, cows, chickens and sometimes guinea pigs.

== Cuisine ==
Taquile offers a wide range of typical dishes. Breakfast consists of two pancakes with sugar or bread with eggs, with a cup of tea made from either Muña or Coca. For lunch, dishes are a vegetable soup, fish with rice and a tomato and onion salad. For dinner, the Taquilean people serve vegetable soup with bread.

== Religion ==
The majority of the inhabitants of Taquile are Catholic. They adapted this religion, harmonizing Andean religion with the syncretic Christian culture. The mother earth (Pachamama), the principal Andean deity, directly controls harvesting and fertility; the island is home to four Apus, Andean mountaintop deities. People make several offerings to these deities each year, and they offer three coca leaves prior to each activity or trip. God is present throughout the year in the festivities. The two Catholic churches are in Centre and Huayllano; a Seventh-day Adventist church is located in Huayrapata.

== Infrastructure ==
Taquile has a radio station and is equipped with generators. Islanders have elected to use solar panels to generate energy.

== Flora ==
Flowers and trees on the Island include Kolle, the tree used to roof the houses and for firewood, the Cantuta flower (the national flower of Peru), the Chukjo (used as detergent) and Muña, used as natural medicines. Coca leaves are not cultivated in Taquile.

<text>Strawberry Switchblade were a Scottish pop duo formed in Glasgow in 1981 by Jill Bryson and Rose McDowall, best known for their song &quot;Since Yesterday&quot; from 1985, and their flamboyant clothing with bows and polka-dots.

==History==
===Before being signed===
The punk movement expanded rapidly in the United Kingdom in 1976. At the time, Rose McDowall and Jill Bryson were part of the bohemian art scene who adored the New York Dolls and who followed Scottish punk band Nu-Sonics (later Orange Juice) during their career, with McDowall playing and recording with Paisley punk band The Poems. The group took their name from a proposed Orange Juice zine.

The band&#x27;s very first incarnation, an all-female 4 piece, recorded one demo at Glasgow&#x27;s Hellfire Club and played a handful of gigs. Friends Janis Goodlet and Carole McGowan completed the line up on bass and drums respectively.

Strawberry Switchblade played at a John Peel gig in Scotland, and he invited them to record a session for his BBC Radio 1 show in October 1982. They also recorded a session for David Jensen&#x27;s Radio 1 show three days later. On both sessions the band were augmented by James Kirk from Orange Juice on bass and Shahid Sarwar from The Recognitions on drums.

===Early days making records===
The sessions were heard by Bill Drummond (a Scottish musician who went on to form The KLF) and David Balfe, manager and keyboard player with the recently defunct The Teardrop Explodes. They signed the band to their publishing label, Zoo Music (in partnership with Warner Bros Music). David Balfe then went on to become the group&#x27;s manager.

The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Trees and Flowers&quot;, was released in July 1983 through 92 Happy Customers, an independent record label run by Will Sergeant from Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, and sold over 10,000 copies. Critically acclaimed, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer Peter Martin praised the &quot;deliciously sad and reflective vocals over some luxuriantly delicate music&quot; and deemed it an &quot;immediate classic&quot;. It was featured at number 47 in John Peel&#x27;s 1983 Festive 50. &quot;Trees and Flowers&quot; was written by Jill Bryson about her anxiety disorder, agoraphobia. It featured Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera on guitar and was produced by Bill Drummond.

Drummond, who&#x27;d begun to work as A&amp;R for WEA, signed the band to Warner Music Group subsidiary Korova in 1983. They got a full backing band with whom they toured and began recording an album with producer Robin Millar. However, at the record company&#x27;s behest, they reverted to the duo of Bryson and McDowall and for production duties they hired David Motion, who would soon go on to produce hits for Red Box.

===&quot;Since Yesterday&quot;===
In late 1984 their second single, &quot;Since Yesterday&quot;, was released. Having been given a large marketing push over the festive period, it became a UK top ten hit in early 1985, peaking at number 5, and also met with success in Europe and Japan.

Their cover version of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; (originally by Velvet Underground) was released as an extra track on the 12&quot; of &quot;Since Yesterday&quot;. It was not included on any of the Strawberry Switchblade albums.

The track&#x27;s opening fanfare came from the third movement of Sibelius&#x27;s Symphony No. 5.

===Later records===

In March 1985 they released their next single, &quot;Let Her Go&quot;.

Following the release of their eponymous album in April, in May 1985 they released a further single, the ballad &quot;Who Knows What Love Is&quot;, one of two tracks on the album produced by Phil Thornalley of The Cure.

Their fifth single, an electro-pop cover of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Jolene&quot;, was issued in September 1985 in the UK and Japan.

In 1985, they also provided vocals for an &quot;alien funeral preocession&quot; in &quot;Rigel 9&quot;, a &quot;space opera&quot; project by David Bedford (music) and Ursula K. Le Guin (lyrics).

Although their commercial success had waned in the UK they remained popular in Japan and two later singles, &quot;Ecstasy (Apple of My Eye)&quot; and &quot;I Can Feel&quot;, were only issued in that country. The second of these only featured McDowall as by this time the partnership had irreparably fractured. By early 1986, the group had disbanded.

In December 2005, Warner Bros. Platinum Records released a career retrospective of the band, made up of sixteen different tracks from various recordings on one compact disc. It included one previously unreleased track, a demo version of &quot;I Can Feel&quot;.

The band&#x27;s earliest studio recordings, three songs recorded in 1982 when they were still a quartet was released as a limited edition 7&quot; EP in January 2017. The version of &quot;Trees and Flowers&quot; on the EP proved very popular on TikTok and it has become the band&#x27;s most popular track on music on Spotify.

===Solo work===
McDowall continued in music, playing with many neofolk bands and performing in and around Glasgow, alongside old and new friends associated with her current representation, Night School Records, including Michael Kasparis, cellist Jo Quail, and McDowall’s son Bobi Lee. In 2018-2019, Rose McDowall and Shawn Pinchbeck provided the soundtrack for the film &quot;Far From the Apple Tree&quot;.

In July 2013, after a break of almost 30 years from music, Jill Bryson returned to songwriting in a new band called The Shapists (named after the fictitious art movement in the film &quot;The Rebel&quot;), that includes her daughter Jessie Frost.

<text>Rifleman John Beeley VC (8 February 1918 – 21 November 1941) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Beeley was 23 years old, and a rifleman in the 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, British Army during Operation Crusader in the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 November 1941 at Sidi Rezegh, Libya, at an airfield being attacked by Rifleman Beeley&#x27;s company, progress was held up by short range fire. All the officers of the company were wounded so, on his own initiative the rifleman ran forward over open ground, firing his Bren gun and at 20 yards range put an anti-tank gun and two machine-guns out of action. He was killed but his bravery inspired his comrades to further efforts to reach their objective, which was eventually captured, together with 700 prisoners.

He is buried in the Knightsbridge War Cemetery, Acroma, Libya. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England. A street in Openshaw, Manchester, has been named &quot;John Beeley Avenue&quot; in his honour.

<text>Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (24 September 1878 – 23 May 1947) was a French-speaking Swiss writer.

==Biography==

He was born in Lausanne in the canton of Vaud and was educated at the University of Lausanne. He taught briefly in nearby Aubonne, and then in Weimar, Germany. In 1903, he left for Paris and remained there until World War I, with frequent trips home to Switzerland. As part of his studies in Paris he wrote a thesis on the poet Maurice de Guérin. In 1903, he published &quot;Le petit village&quot;, a collection of poems.

In 1914, he returned to Switzerland.

He wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Histoire du soldat&quot;.

He died in Pully, near Lausanne in 1947. His likeness and an artistic impression of his works appear on the 200 Swiss franc note (no longer in current use).

The Foundation C.F. Ramuz in Pully awards the Grand Prix C. F. Ramuz.

<text>Candida Royalle (born Candice Marion Vadala; October 15, 1950 – September 7, 2015) was an American producer and director of couples-oriented pornography, pornographic actress, sex educator, and sex-positive feminist. She was a member of the XRCO and the AVN Halls of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Royalle was born Candice Marion Vadala on October 15, 1950 to a working-class Catholic family in Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Louis, worked as a professional jazz drummer and had a hot temper. Her mother, Peggy Frazier, left the family when Royalle was 18 months old and Royalle never saw her again. Candice and her sister Cinthea were raised by their stepmother, Helen Duffy. 

Trained in music, dance and art in New York City, she studied at the High School of Art and Design, Parsons School of Design and the City College of New York.

==Career==

After graduating from Parsons School of Design, she moved to California and began performing with the avant-garde theater group The Cockettes. In 1975, she played Divine&#x27;s daughter in the play &quot;The Heartbreak of Psoriasis&quot;.

In 1975, she began her career as a pornographic performer, appearing in about 25 movies including &quot;Hot &amp; Saucy Pizza Girls.&quot; Her final film was &quot;Blue Magic&quot; in 1980, which she also wrote. Royalle quit performing because she got married and was uncomfortable being sexual with other men. Moreover, she had increasingly felt that her strongly feminist views were at odds with the male-centric manner in which traditional pornography was produced and that she had been working in, giving virtually no attention to the female perspective, and making no effort to appeal to female viewers. The increasing availability of cable television and VCR around 1983 provided Royalle both with an incentive and opportunity to consider producing her own &quot;feminist&quot; pornography, aimed at women and couples who wanted to watch a different kind of porn from the privacy of their homes. 

Royalle returned to New York in 1980. In early 1984, she founded Femme Productions together with Lauren Neimi. Their goal was making erotica based on female desire, as well as pornographic films aimed at helping couple therapy. Her productions are aimed more at women and couples than at the standard pornographic audience of men, and have been praised by counselors and therapists for depicting healthy and realistic sexual activity.

Royalle stated that she tried to avoid &quot;misogynous predictability&quot;, and depiction of sex in &quot;...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.&quot; She also criticized the male-centredness of the typical pornographic film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates. Royalle&#x27;s films are not &quot;goal oriented&quot; towards a final &quot;cum shot&quot;; instead, her films depict sexual activity within the broader context of women&#x27;s emotional and social lives. In 1989, she signed the Post Porn Modernist Manifesto.

She was featured in Maya Gallus&#x27;s 1997 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

Royalle wrote regular columns for adult magazines &quot;High Society&quot; and &quot;Cheri&quot;. She was also a public speaker, giving lectures at Smithsonian Institution, the World Congress on Sexology, and numerous universities and professional conferences.

In 2004, she authored the book &quot;How to Tell a Naked Man What to Do&quot;.

A five-track EP titled &quot;Candida Cosmica&quot;, a collaboration between Royalle and Patrick Cowley from the mid-1970s, was released in October 2016 by Dark Entries Records.

==Affiliations==
Royalle was a member of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists, and a founding board member of Feminists for Free Expression.

==Personal life and death==
In the 1980s, Royalle was married to producer Per Sjöstedt; they separated in 1988. In May 2006, she announced that she was engaged to be married. She died in Mattituck, New York on September 7, 2015, aged 64, from ovarian cancer.

==Legacy==
In 2019, &quot;Candice&quot;, a documentary about Royalle&#x27;s life and finding out what happened to her mother who left her as a child, was screened at various documentary film festivals. It was directed by Sheona McDonald and distributed by Mbur Indie Film Distribution.

Royalle is the subject of the book &quot;Candida Royalle and the Sexual Revolution: A History From Below&quot; by Jane Kamensky, a former historian at Harvard University. Kamensky describes Royalle&#x27;s unique place in feminist history. &quot;She is way too critical and self-critical for many of the sex-positive feminists... and she absolutely does not fit into an anti-pornography box&quot;, Kamensky told &quot;The New York Times.&quot; Kamensky worked to put Royalle&#x27;s archive, including her photos, letters, film clips, and other memorabilia, into the Schlesinger Library.

== Filmography ==
During her acting career (1975–1980), Royalle performed in 25 traditional male-centred porn films, including &quot;Ball Game&quot; (1980) by Ann Perry, &quot;Hot &amp; Saucy Pizza Girls&quot;, &quot;Hot Racquettes&quot;, &quot;Delicious&quot;, &quot;Fascination&quot; by Chuck Vincent, and finally &quot;Blue Magic&quot; (1980), which Royalle also wrote and her then-new husband Per Sjöstedt produced.

By 2013, Royalle had (jointly) written or directed 18 feminist porn films with Femme Productions since 1984, including:

* &quot;Femme&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Urban Heat&quot; (1984)

<text>William Beesley VC (5 October 1895 – 23 September 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Beesley was 22 years old, and a private in the 13th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 8 May 1918 at Bucquoy, France, when Private Beesley&#x27;s platoon sergeant and all the section commanders were killed he took command. Single-handed he rushed a post, shot four of the enemy, took six prisoners and sent them back to his lines. He and a comrade then brought his Lewis gun into action, inflicting many casualties and holding their position for four hours until the second private was wounded. Private Beesley, by himself, maintained his position until nightfall, when he returned to the original line with the wounded man and the Lewis gun which he kept in action until things had quietened down.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England.

<text>William of Durham (died 1249) is said to have founded University College, Oxford, England. He most likely came from Sedgefield, County Durham and was educated at Wearmouth monastery and in Paris, France.

William of Durham was archdeacon of Caux and (in 1235, for a few months) archbishop-elect of Rouen in Normandy, France.

When, in 1229, riots broke out in Paris, he may have been the leader of a group of students who migrated from that city to Oxford, but this tradition is not attested to by contemporary sources. What is more certain is that he held several rich benefices in England and died in Rouen, in 1249.

He left 310 marks, a large amount of money, in his will to be invested in rents that would support scholars in Oxford. This benefaction resulted in one of the first of the Oxford halls or colleges. Subsequently, this foundation took the name of University College.

==Legacy==
University College, Oxford now has a William of Durham Club for old members leaving a legacy to the College.

<text>Penobscot Knob, also Penobscot Mountain, is a summit that is located in the western fringe of the Poconos nearest to Mountain Top, Pennsylvania. The Solomon Gap pass below it contains an important multi-modal transportation corridor.

==History and notable features==
At one time before incorporation, Mountain Top and the saddle of the pass was known by the Amerindian name Penobscot. Penobscot Mountain forms part of the drainage divide between the Lehigh Valley &amp; greater Delaware River drainage basin and the Wyoming and Susquehanna Valley, part of the Potomac River drainage basin. The pass formed between Penobscot and Haystack Mountain a few thousand feet to the West was one of the few places a railroad could be envisioned in the 1830s when the fuel crises in eastern cities demanded easier transportation to the Northern Anthracite Coal Fields, which ironically, came to be exploited by the company with a near monopoly in providing coal from the Southern Anthracite region, Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company (LC&amp;N, f.1821), which had built both the Lehigh Canal and the nation&#x27;s second railway, the Summit Hill &amp; Mauch Chunk Railroad.

The whole uplands north and west faces overlook the Wyoming Valley from the southeastern corner near Hazleton towards and through the greater south Wilkes-Barre area. The southern and eastern slopes just give peeks into portions of the Poconos and wider views of the Lehigh Valley descending down to White Haven, for the Poconos technically are left-bank bounded by the Lehigh.
The shoulders of the peak, an elevated flat area saddle pass peak today is perhaps best known as the site of many local television and radio station transmitter antennas. The first broadcast station located there was WIZZ FM followed by WILK FM. Much of the engineering and work on the WIZZ site was conducted by Major Edwin Armstrong, the inventor of several technologies including FM.

WIZZ is now WMGS which still broadcasts from the same building erected in 1947 for WIZZ. WILK FM became WILK TV then WNEP TV. WVIA-TV, WVIA-FM, WNEP, WYOU, WBRE, and WOLF-TV are some of the major stations that broadcast from the high elevation there, but the peak was known for another reason in the nineteenth century, the saddle or pass on its western slope together with its other terrain features were the best place to build a railroad across the south and east faces of the bowl of the Wyoming Valley from the &#x27;direct road&#x27; down the level water route to the Delaware Canal and Delaware River above and alongside the Lehigh Canal, cutting off nearly 100 miles from a rail trip to Philadelphia.

Penobscot Hill is about above sea level.

==Analog broadcast tower collapse==
WNEP-TV&#x27;s transmission tower broadcasting the analog signal on channel 16 collapsed on December 16, 2007, due to severe ice, winds, and snow at the transmitter location on Penobscot Knob. The tower collapse also destroyed the transmitter building. No one was injured during the incident. Transmission of the digital signal on channel 49 was restored after a brief interruption of power to the tower supporting the digital transmitter and antenna. WNEP&#x27;s signal on local cable systems and satellite was restored before the end of the day. The ice and winds on December 16, 2007, also brought down or damaged the towers broadcasting WYOU-TV, WBRE-TV (digital), WVIA-TV (analog and digital), and WCLH which are located within proximity on Penobscot Knob. The WNEP tower completely collapsed.

The top of the WVIA tower fell, as well as its digital antenna. The WNEP tower fell across power lines knocking out the power to the other transmitters, except the WBRE analog transmitter, which was on a different line.

<text>The Battle of Makin was an engagement of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought from 20 to 24 November 1943 on Makin Atoll in the Gilbert Islands.

==Background==

===Japanese invasion and fortification===
On 10 December 1941, three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, 300 Japanese troops plus laborers of the Gilberts Invasion Special Landing Force had arrived off Makin Atoll and occupied it without resistance. Lying east of the Marshall Islands, Makin was intended as an excellent seaplane base to protect the eastern flank of the Japanese perimeter from an Allied attack by extending Japanese air patrols closer to islands held by the Allies: Howland Island, Baker Island, Tuvalu, and Phoenix and Ellice Islands.

Heavy aircraft losses and the disabling of four heavy cruisers during the bombing of Rabaul meant that the original Japanese plan of a strike at the American invasion fleet by forces based at Truk in the nearby Caroline Islands was scrapped. The garrisons at Tarawa and Makin were left to their fate.

===Marine raid on Makin===

On 17 August 1942, 211 Marines of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion under command of Colonel Evans Carlson and Captain James Roosevelt were landed on Makin from two submarines, USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; and USS &quot;Argonaut&quot;. The Japanese garrison only posted 83 to 160 men under the command of a warrant officer. The Raiders killed many Japanese but ultimately, under heavy fire withdrew after losing 21 killed and 9 captured. The Japanese moved their prisoners to Kwajalein Atoll, where they were later beheaded. One objective of the raid was to confuse the Japanese about U.S. intentions in the Pacific, but it had the effect of alerting the Japanese to the strategic importance of the Gilbert Islands and led to their further reinforcement and fortification.

After Carlson&#x27;s raid, the Japanese reinforced the Gilberts. Makin was garrisoned with a single company of the 5th Special Base Force (700–800 men) in August 1942, and work on both the seaplane base and coastal defenses of the atoll was resumed in earnest. By July 1943 the seaplane base on Makin was completed and ready to accommodate Kawanishi H8K &quot;Emily&quot; flying boat bombers, Nakajima A6M2-N &quot;Rufe&quot; floatplane fighters and Aichi E13A &quot;Jake&quot; reconnaissance seaplanes. Its defenses were also completed, although they were not as extensive as on Tarawa Atoll—the main Japanese Navy air base in the Gilberts. The &quot;Chitose&quot; and 653rd Air Corps were detached and deployed here. While the Japanese were building up their defenses in the Gilberts, American forces were making plans to retake the islands.

===U.S. plans to attack===
The end of the Aleutian Islands campaign and progress in the Solomon Islands, combined with increasing supplies of men and material, gave the United States Navy the resources to make an invasion of the central Pacific in late 1943. Admiral Chester Nimitz had argued for this invasion earlier in 1943, but the resources were not available to carry it out at the same time as Operation Cartwheel, the envelopment of Rabaul in the Bismarck Islands. The plan was to approach the Japanese home islands by &quot;island hopping&quot;: establishing naval and air bases in one group of islands to support the attack on the next. The Gilbert Islands were the first step in this chain.

In June 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC), to submit a plan to occupy the Marshall Islands. Initially both Nimitz and Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations, wanted to attack right into the heart of the Japanese outer defense perimeter, but any plan for assaulting the Marshalls directly from Pearl Harbor would have required more troops and transports than the Pacific Fleet had at the time. Considering these drawbacks and the limited combat experience of the U.S. forces, King and Nimitz decided to take the Marshalls in a step-by-step operation via the Ellice and Gilbert Islands. The Gilberts lay within of the southern Marshalls and were well within range of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft based in the Ellice Islands, which could provide bombing support and long-range reconnaissance for operations in the Gilberts. With those advantages in mind, on 20 July 1943 the joint Chiefs of Staff decided to capture the Tarawa and Abemama atolls in the Gilberts, plus nearby Nauru Island. The operation was codenamed &quot;Operation Galvanic.&quot;
On 4 September, the U.S. 5th Fleet&#x27;s amphibious troops were designated the V Amphibious Corps and placed under Marine Corps Major General Holland Smith. The V Amphibious Corps had two divisions, the 2nd Marine Division based in New Zealand, and the U.S. Army&#x27;s 27th Infantry Division based in Hawaii. The 27th Infantry Division had been a New York National Guard unit before being called into federal service in October 1940. It was transferred to Hawaii and remained there for 1½ years before being chosen by Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson Jr., U.S. Army Commanding General in the Central Pacific, for the Gilbert Islands invasion. Captain James Jones (father of James L. Jones, Commandant of the Marine Corps 1999–2003), Commanding Officer of Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, VAC performed a periscope reconnaissance of the Gilberts aboard the submarine USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, establishing accurate accounts of the beachheads for the upcoming invasion.

The 27th Infantry Division was tasked to supply the landing force, with one regimental combat team (the 165th Infantry Regiment, the famed &quot;Fighting 69th&quot; of the New York National Guard), reinforced by a battalion landing team (the 3rd Battalion, 105th Infantry Regiment), supported by the 105th Field Artillery Battalion and the 193rd Tank Battalion, under Major General Ralph C. Smith, a veteran of World War I who had assumed command in November 1942. He was one of the most highly respected officers in the U. S. Army of the time. In April 1943, the 27th Infantry Division had begun preparing for amphibious operations.

Planning for the 27th Infantry Division&#x27;s role in &quot;Galvanic&quot; (the Army portion was codenamed &quot;Kourbash&quot;) began in early August 1943, with Nauru Island in the western Gilberts as the original objective. Unlike the other objectives, Nauru was an actual island, much larger in size and more heavily garrisoned.

However, in September 1943 the 27th&#x27;s objective changed. The difficulty of providing adequate naval and air support of simultaneous operations at Tarawa and the much more distant Nauru, plus lack of sufficient transport to carry the entire division required to take the larger, more heavily defended Nauru, caused Admiral Nimitz to shift the 27th&#x27;s objective from Nauru to Makin Atoll, in the northeast Gilberts. The 27th Infantry Division staff learned the change of target on 28 September, scrapped the original Nauru plan, and began planning to capture Makin.

==Prelude==
The invasion fleet, Task Force 52 (TF 52) commanded by Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, left Pearl Harbor on 10 November 1943. The landing force, Task Group 52.6, consisted of units of the 27th Infantry Division transported by attack transports &quot;Neville&quot;, &quot;Leonard Wood&quot;, &quot;Calvert&quot;, and &quot;Pierce&quot;; attack cargo ship &quot;Alcyone&quot;; landing ship dock &quot;Belle Grove&quot;; and LSTs −31, −78, and −179 of Task Group 52.1.

On the eve of invasion, the Japanese garrison on Makin Atoll&#x27;s main island, Butaritari, numbered 806 men: 284 naval ground troops of the 6th Special Naval Landing Force, 108 aviation personnel of the 802nd and 952nd Aviation Units, 138 troops of the 111th Pioneers, and 276 men of the Fourth Fleet Construction Department and Makin Tank Detachment of 3rd Special Base Force (3 Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks), all commanded by Lieutenant (junior grade) Seizo Ishikawa. The number of trained combat troops on Makin was not more than 300 soldiers.

Butaritari&#x27;s land defenses were centered around the lagoon shore, near the seaplane base in the central part of the island. There were two tank barrier systems: the west tank barrier extended from the lagoon two-thirds of the way across Butaritari, was 12 to wide and deep, and was protected by one anti-tank gun in a concrete pillbox, six machine gun positions, and 50 rifle pits. The east tank barrier, wide and in depth, stretched from the lagoon across two-thirds of the island and bent westward with log antitank barricades at each end. It was protected by a double apron of barbed wire and an intricate system of gun emplacements and rifle pits.

A series of strongpoints was established along Butaritari&#x27;s ocean side, with coastal defense guns, three 37 mm anti-tank gun positions, 10 machine gun emplacements and 85 rifle pits. The Japanese expected the invasion to come on the ocean side of Butaritari, following the example of Carlson&#x27;s raid in 1942, and established their defenses from where the raid had taken place. Without aircraft, ships, or hope of reinforcement or relief, the outnumbered and outgunned defenders could only hope to delay the coming American attack for as long as possible.

==Battle==

===Invasion===
Air operations against Makin began on 13 November 1943, with B-24 bombers of the Seventh Air Force from the Ellice Islands. Grumman FM-1 Wildcat fighters escorted Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and Grumman TBF Avengers from escort carriers USS &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;, USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and USS &quot;Corregidor&quot;; followed by support guns from fire support ship USS &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and other war vessels. During the bombardment, a turret explosion on battleship killed 43 sailors.

Troops began to go ashore at two beaches at 08:30 on 20 November. The initial landings on Red Beach went according to plan with the assault troops moving rapidly inland after an uneventful trip on the ocean side of the island. Their progress off the beach was slowed only by an occasional sniper and the need to negotiate their way around the debris and water-filled craters left by the air and naval bombardment. The craters in particular stymied tank support of the Red Beach forces by the light tanks of the 193rd Tank Battalion when the lead M3 Stuart light tank became partially submerged in a shellhole and blocked passage of all the vehicles behind it.

As the landing craft approached Yellow Beach from the lagoon, they began to receive small-arms and machine-gun fire from the island&#x27;s defenders. The assault troops were also surprised to discover that even though they were approaching the beach at high tide as planned, a miscalculation of the lagoon&#x27;s depth caused their small boats to go aground, forcing them to walk the final to the beach in waist-deep water. Equipment and weapons were lost or water-soaked, and three men were killed approaching the beach, mainly because the defenders chose to make their final stand farther inland along the tank barriers.

The U.S. invasion plan was conceived in the hope of luring the Japanese into committing most of its forces to oppose the first landings on Red Beach and thereby allow the troops landing on Yellow Beach to attack from the rear. The Japanese, however, did not respond to the attack on Red Beach and withdrew from Yellow Beach with only harassing fire, leaving the troops of the 27th Division no choice but to knock out the fortified strongpoints one by one. Reduction operations were hampered by the frequent inability to use heavy support weapons, including tanks, because of the danger of cross-fire. The commander of the 165th Infantry Regiment, Colonel Gardiner Conroy, was killed in action by a Japanese sniper on the afternoon of the first day and was succeeded by Colonel Gerard W. Kelley.

===Capture of Makin===
Two days of determined fighting reduced Japanese resistance. After clearing the entire atoll, Smith reported on the morning of 23 November, &quot;Makin taken, recommend command pass to commander garrison force.&quot;

The most difficult problem capturing Makin was coordinating the actions of two separate landing forces, made more difficult because the defenders did not respond as anticipated. The unsuitability of the narrow beaches for supply landing operations—which went undiscovered by pre-invasion reconnaissance—was also a severe handicap.

===Sinking of USS &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;===
In the early hours of 24 November the escort carrier and flagship USS &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was sunk by the Japanese submarine &quot;I-175&quot;, which had arrived near Makin just a few hours before. A single torpedo, launched as part of a torpedo spread by &quot;I-175&quot;, detonated the &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;&#x27;s aircraft bomb stockpile, causing an explosion which engulfed the entire ship, causing it to sink quickly. The attack on the &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; accounted for the majority of American casualties in the Battle of Makin. Of the 916 crewmen of &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;, 702 perished (54 officers and 648 enlisted men), including the flagship&#x27;s admiral and task force group commander, Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix, Captain Irving Wiltsie, and Pearl Harbor Navy Cross recipient Cook Second Class Doris Miller.

The loss of the &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; on the eve of Thanksgiving that year was caused by a few factors. Two destroyers of the destroyer screen, USS &quot;Hull&quot; and USS &quot;Franks&quot;, left the destroyer screen, leaving a gap in the screen. Also, the task force which included the &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was not zigzagging. The Japanese submarine &quot;I-175&quot; approached the task force undetected and fired a spread of torpedoes through the gap in the anti-submarine screen, one of which struck and sank the &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The complete occupation of Makin took four days and cost considerably more in naval casualties than in ground forces. Despite possessing great superiority in men and weapons, the 27th Division had difficulty subduing the island&#x27;s small defense force. One Japanese Ha-Go tank was destroyed in combat, and two tanks placed in revetments were abandoned without being used in combat.

Against an estimated 395 Japanese casualties in action during the operation, American ground casualties numbered 66 killed and 152 wounded, representing nearly 1.8 Japanese casualties for every American casualty, although a considerable number of Japanese casualties would&#x27;ve been incurred before the landing, due to naval and aerial bombardment. U.S. Navy losses were significantly higher: 702 deaths on the &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;, 43 killed in a turret fire on the battleship , and 10 killed in action with naval shore parties or as aviators, for a total of 755 naval deaths. The overall total of 821 American dead equaled double the number of men in the entire Japanese garrison.

<text>Gail Delta Collins (February 2, 1941 – December 6, 2013) was an American songwriter, record producer, and visual artist. She was convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the 1983 killing of her husband Felix Pappalardi.

==Biography==
Collins married Felix Pappalardi on May 30, 1969. She came to prominence (as &#x27;Miss Gail Collins&#x27;) co-producing, with Pappalardi, the self-titled debut album by Energy, a group featuring Corky Laing. She also co-produced, with Pappalardi, the &quot;Felix Pappalardi and Creation&quot; album in 1976. Collins co-wrote Cream&#x27;s &quot;World of Pain&quot; with her husband and &quot;Strange Brew&quot; with Pappalardi and Eric Clapton. Both songs are included on the album &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;. She contributed lyrics to many Mountain songs. Her artwork appears on many album covers by Mountain, including &quot;Climbing!&quot;, &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot;, &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot;, &quot;Mountain Live: The Road Goes Ever On&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and &quot;Avalanche&quot;. She was associate producer on the 1978 album by Hot Tuna, &quot;Double Dose&quot;.

On April 17, 1983, Felix Pappalardi was shot once in the neck in the fifth-floor apartment he shared with Collins Pappalardi at 30 Waterside Plaza in New York City. He was pronounced dead at the scene, and Collins Pappalardi was charged with second-degree murder. Collins Pappalardi claimed that the killing was an accident. During the trial, it was revealed that the couple had an open marriage and that Collins Pappalardi had shot her husband after he had returned in the early morning from seeing his girlfriend. She was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter but found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to 16 months to 4 years in prison. On April 30, 1985, she was released on parole.

On December 6, 2013, Collins was found dead by her landlord in the Mexican village of Ajijic, Jalisco, a resort town with many American expatriate residents. She had been undergoing cancer treatments there. She was cremated. Her three cats were euthanized after her death and cremated so that their ashes could be mixed with hers.

<text>The Albin Vega, also called the Vega 27, is a Swedish sailboat that was designed by Per Brohäll as cruiser and first built in 1965.

The design was developed into the longer Singoalla 34 in 1970.

==Production==
The design was built by Albin Marine in Sweden from 1965 until 1979, with about 3,450 boats completed, but it is now out of production. The Vega 27 is probably the most produced Scandinavian keelboat.

==Design==

The Vega is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig with aluminum spars, a deck-stepped mast, wire standing rigging and a single set of unswept spreaders. The hull has a slightly reverse sheer line, a spooned raked stem, an angled transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed modified long keel, with a cutaway forefoot. It displaces and carries of cast iron ballast.

The boat has a draft of with the standard keel.

The boat is fitted with a Swedish Volvo Penta MD6A diesel engine of for docking and manoeuvring. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .

The design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double &quot;V&quot;-berth in the bow cabin and two straight settees in the main cabin. The galley is located on both sides of the companionway ladder, with the two-burner stove to port and the sink to starboard. A navigation station is on the starboard side. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side.

For sailing the design may be equipped with a symmetrical spinnaker of . It has a hull speed of .

==Operational history==
The boat is supported by an active class club in the United Kingdom, that organizes racing events, the &quot;Vega Association of Great Britain&quot;.

The Vega has been cruised around the world on many occasions, including by Jarle Andhøy and his crew, in &quot;Berserk&quot;, to Antarctica and to the north of Spitsbergen.

A 36-year-old Albin Vega sailboat, named &quot;St. Brendan&quot; in honour of the 6th-century Irish explorer monk St. Brendan, was used by Matt Rutherford of Annapolis, Maryland in his successful 314-day, solo circumnavigation of North and South America which was officially completed on 18 April 2012, when Rutherford crossed his start and finish line—the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel outside Norfolk, Virginia.

A review in &quot;Good Old Boat&quot; magazine by John Vigor stated, &quot;Brohäll set out to design a boat that was light, fast, roomy, seaworthy, and relatively cheap. This was a seemingly impossible task because sailboat performance is the distilled essence of a series of compromises. What is seaworthy, for example, is not usually fast. What is roomy is not necessarily cheap. But Brohäll succeeded in producing one of those rare designs that exceeds most people&#x27;s expectations in most areas. The one obvious thing the Vega lacks, in comparison with more modern designs, is space down below.&quot;

A review in &quot;Blue Water Boats&quot; concluded, &quot;By all accounts the Vega under sail handles easily and is a well balanced creature with no weather helm. Despite her shallow draft she is reported to point well to windward and while tender initially up to around 10 to 15 degrees of heel she carries full sail easily up to 20 knots. She&#x27;s a fast boat downwind but offshore cruisers would do well to carry a large spinnaker or drifter for light airs.&quot;

<text>Harry Churchill Beet VC (1 April 1873 – 10 January 1946) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Beet was 27 years old, and a corporal in the 1st Battalion, Derbyshire Regiment, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place on 22 April 1900 at Wakkerstroom, South Africa, for which he was awarded the VC:

He stayed in South Africa until after the war had ended in June 1902, and returned to the United Kingdom on the SS &quot;Syria&quot; in September that year. On his return to his hometown Long Eaton, Derbyshire, his townsmen gave him what was reported as a ″great reception″.

He later achieved the rank of captain. He later emigrated to Saskatchewan, Canada, where he fought with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I. In 1936 he settled in Vancouver where he remained until his death.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum, The Castle, Nottingham, England.

<text>Billy Joe Shaver (August 16, 1939 – October 28, 2020) was an American singer, songwriter and actor.

Billy Joe was a prominent figure in the outlaw country genre. He is considered one of the great American songwriters of his generation. He has received praise from Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and many others.

Artists including Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Tom T. Hall and Johnny Cash have recorded his songs.

==Biography==
Shaver was born in Corsicana, Texas, and raised by his mother, Victory Watson Shaver. Until he was 12, he spent a great deal of time with his grandmother in Corsicana, so his mother could work in Waco. He sometimes accompanied his mother to her job at a local nightclub, where he was first exposed to country music.

Shaver&#x27;s mother remarried about the time that his grandmother died, and Shaver and his older sister Patricia moved in with their mother and new stepfather. Shaver left school after the eighth grade to help his uncles pick cotton, but occasionally returned to school to play sports.

Shaver joined the U.S. Navy on his 17th birthday. Upon his discharge, he worked a series of dead-end jobs, including trying to be a rodeo clown. About this time, he met and married Brenda Joyce Tindell. They had one son, John Edwin, known as Eddy, who was born in 1962. The two divorced and remarried several times.

Shaver took a job at a lumber mill to make ends meet. One day, his right (dominant) hand became caught in the machinery, and he lost the better part of two fingers and contracted a serious infection. He eventually recovered, and taught himself to play the guitar without the missing fingers.

Shaver set out to hitchhike to Los Angeles. He could not get a ride west, so he went to the other side of the highway and headed east, accompanying a man who dropped him off just outside Memphis, Tennessee. The next ride brought him to Nashville, where he found a job as a songwriter for $50 per week. His work came to the attention of Waylon Jennings, who filled most of his album &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot; with Shaver&#x27;s songs after meeting in a travel trailer at Willie Nelson&#x27;s 4 July picnic. Other artists, including Elvis Presley and Kris Kristofferson, began to record Shaver&#x27;s music. This led to him getting his own record deal.

The first few recording companies he signed with soon folded. He was never able to gain widespread recognition as a singer, although he never stopped recording his own music. On his records, he has been accompanied by other major rock and country musicians such as Willie Nelson, Nanci Griffith, Chuck Leavell and Dickey Betts (of the Allman Brothers), Charlie Daniels, Flaco Jiménez, and Al Kooper.

Bob Dylan mentioned Shaver in his song &quot;I Feel a Change Comin&#x27; On&quot; (Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter) on the album, &quot;Together Through Life&quot; (2009) – &quot;I&#x27;m listening to Billy Joe Shaver, And I&#x27;m reading James Joyce&quot;. Shaver is also the &quot;hero&quot; of the song, &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Write Like Billy Joe&quot; on the album &quot;Stormy Love&quot; by Bugs Henderson.

Shaver&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Old Five and Dimers Like Me&quot; (1973), contained many songs noted for being performed by other artists that were written by him, such as David Allan Coe and Waylon Jennings. &quot;When I Get My Wings&quot; (1976) included &quot;Ain&#x27;t No God In Mexico&quot; (also a hit for Waylon Jennings). &quot;Gypsy Boy&quot; (1977) included &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot; and &quot;You Asked Me To&quot;, both songs written by Shaver for Jennings&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot;.

Shaver is also known for his hit &quot;Live Forever&quot;, co-written by his son Eddy; Robert Duvall performs it in the movie &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;, and it is included in the soundtrack. The song was also performed by The Highwaymen, Willie Nelson and Joe Ely. Shaver also wrote numerous songs for artists such as Patty Loveless and Willie Nelson.After losing his wife, Brenda, and his mother to cancer in 1999, Shaver lost his son and longtime guitarist Eddy Shaver, who died at age 38 on December 31, 2000. The listed cause of death was a heroin overdose, but there were suspicious circumstances surrounding the case as his face was bruised as if he had been punched multiple times, and the daughter of an Austin police officer was at the residence at the time. Folk country artist Todd Snider wrote and dedicated his song &quot;Waco Moon&quot; to Eddy. 

Shaver nearly died the following year when he had a heart attack on stage during an Independence Day show at Gruene Hall in New Braunfels, Texas. After successful heart surgery, Shaver came back to release &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Child&quot; in 2002.

Shaver continued to release records throughout the 1990s; the most notable was the critically acclaimed &quot;Tramp On Your Street,&quot; released in 1993, which prominently featured the guitar playing of Eddy Shaver. In 1999, Shaver performed at the Grand Ole Opry. In November 2005, he performed on the &quot;CMT Outlaws&quot; in 2005. In 2006, Shaver was inducted in the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame. He later served as spiritual advisor to Texas independent gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman. For his efforts, the Americana Music Convention awarded him their Lifetime Achievement Award in Songwriting. He lived in Waco, Texas.

Shaver&#x27;s 2007 album country gospel style &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Brother&quot; was Grammy-nominated. Many of the songs are duets with artists such as Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, and Tanya Tucker. Musicians playing on the album included Randy Scruggs, Laura Cash, John Anderson, and Marty Stuart.

On May 22, 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; premiered the single-duet with Willie Nelson &quot;Hard To Be An Outlaw&quot;. The album, &quot;Long in the Tooth&quot; was released on August 5, 2014, by Lightning Rod Records. After a 41-year career, &quot;Long in the Tooth&quot; became Shaver&#x27;s first album to chart in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Country Albums, entering the chart at 19. The album also entered the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, peaking at 157.

In 2019, Shaver received the Poet&#x27;s Award from the Academy of Country Music to honor his achievements in songwriting.

In 2022 a tribute album of Shaver&#x27;s songs was released &quot;Live Forever: A Tribute To Billy Joe Shaver&quot; which include tracks from Willie Nelson, Lucinda Williams, Ryan Bingham, Nikki Lane, Rodney Crowell, George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Steve Earle, Nathaniel, Amanda Shire, Margo Price, and others.

In 2023, Shaver&#x27;s voice appeared on Tanya Tucker’s critically acclaimed album &quot;Sweet Western Sound&quot;. Shaver’s voice appeared at the beginning to open the album and at the end to close the album.

=== Death ===
Shaver died on October 28, 2020, from a stroke at the age of 81.

==Discography==
== Artistry and influence ==

Billy Joe was a prominent figure in the outlaw country genre. He is considered one of the greatest songwriters in country history. Johnny Cash cited him as &quot;One of the greatest songwriters&quot; and Kris Kristofferson said that his lyrics were &quot;on the same level of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s books&quot;.

==Controversy==

=== Shooting at Lorena, Texas ===
On April 2, 2007, police in Lorena, Texas, issued two arrest warrants for Shaver on charges of aggravated assault and possessing a firearm in a prohibited place, in connection with an incident outside a tavern, Papa Joe&#x27;s Texas Saloon, in Lorena two days prior, on March 31, in which Shaver shot a man, Billy Bryant Coker, in the face with a handgun. Coker&#x27;s injuries, however, were not reported as life-threatening.

Witnesses interviewed by police report hearing Shaver say &quot;Where do you want it?&quot; and then, after the shot was fired, &quot;Tell me you are sorry.&quot; and &quot;No one tells me to shut up.&quot; Coker told police the attack was unprovoked. Shaver&#x27;s attorney declared that Shaver had shot Coker &quot;in self-defense&quot; after Coker threatened Shaver with a knife.

In an August 2014 NPR interview, Shaver said that he shot Coker because he was &quot;such a bully&quot; and that &quot;I hit him right between a mother and a fucker. That was the end of that. He dropped his weapons and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well, if you had said that inside, there would have been no problem.&#x27;&quot;

After unsuccessfully attempting to surrender to police in Austin, who were unaware of the warrant, Shaver turned himself in at McLennan County Jail in Waco on April 3. He was released after an hour on $50,000 bond and gave his scheduled performance at Waterloo Records in Austin that evening, where he reportedly told fans, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget to pray for me, and tell your kids to pray for me, too.&quot;

He was acquitted in a Waco court on April 9, 2010, after testifying that he acted in self-defense, with friends Willie Nelson and Robert Duvall in attendance for support.

Texas-based country musician Dale Watson wrote a song about the incident titled &quot;Where Do You Want It?&quot;. The song has been recorded by Whitey Morgan and the 78&#x27;s and appears on their self-titled second album, released by Bloodshot Records.

==Acting==
In 1996, Shaver took a part in the film &quot;The Apostle&quot; playing opposite Robert Duvall. He had additional speaking roles in the Duvall film &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; (2003) and in &quot;The Wendell Baker Story&quot; (2005).

In 2004, a documentary of his life, &quot;A Portrait of Billy Joe&quot;, was released. The documentary was directed by Luciana Pedraza. In 2006, a documentary of a concert, &quot;Billy Joe Shaver – North Carolina 2006&quot; was released on YouTube along with a limited number of DVDs. The documentary was directed by Guy Schwartz, whom Eddie Shaver listed as a musical mentor, and was shot at the Stevens Center at University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

In 2008, he co-starred with Bill Engvall and Billy Ray Cyrus in the made-for-TV USA Network movie, &quot;Bait Shop&quot;. In 2016, he had a cameo in the TV series &quot;Still the King&quot;, also alongside Cyrus.

Comedian Norm Macdonald was an avid Shaver fan and personal friend, opening his book &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; with a quote from one of his songs, and praising his songwriting on his podcast &quot;Norm Macdonald Live&quot;. In 2018, Shaver appeared as a guest on Macdonald&#x27;s Netflix program &quot;Norm Macdonald Has a Show&quot;. In addition, Shaver&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Just an Old Chunk of Coal&quot;, was chosen as the closing music for Macdonald&#x27;s posthumous Netflix comedy release of 2022 &quot;Norm Macdonald: Nothing Special&quot;.

Shaver&#x27;s voice is heard on the themes to the Adult Swim television show &quot;Squidbillies&quot;. The opening themes are only a stanza long and end with a &quot;sotto voce&quot; spoken-word portion. Season 1 Episode 5 of Mike Judge&#x27;s &quot;Tales From The Tour Bus&quot; features the life of Shaver.

<text>Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences (OSU-CHS) is a public medical school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It also has a branch campus in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Founded in 1972, OSU-CHS is part of the Oklahoma State University System. OSU-CHS offers a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) and over fifteen other different graduate degrees.

==History==
OSU-CHS was founded in 1972 as the Oklahoma College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery. It was renamed as the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine when it became part of the OSU System in 1988. In the spring of 2006, the College of Osteopathic Medicine signed an academic affiliation agreement with Tulsa Regional Medical Center to create a permanent teaching hospital for Oklahoma State students. As of November 2, 2006, Tulsa Regional Medical Center was rechristened as the Oklahoma State University Medical Center, as per the terms of the 50-year agreement. Oklahoma legislators appropriated $40 million in funding towards improving the hospital&#x27;s technology and facilities. Among the expected improvements are an expansion of the intensive care unit and renovations to the women&#x27;s health and neonatal intensive care unit programs. OSU Medical Center is the largest osteopathic teaching center in the United States, training 165 resident physicians in primary and sub-specialty care each year.

OSU-CHS includes the College of Osteopathic Medicine, the School of Biomedical Sciences, the School of Forensic Sciences, the School of Healthcare Administration, and the School of Allied Health.

The Center for Health Sciences has conducted research into the condition known as Morgellons, for which there is no known etiology or treatment.

Dr. Edward Goljan is the most well-known faculty member at the school. He is the professor and chair of pathology, and is nationally recognized as an expert educator in medical board exam preparation. Dr. Goljan is author of the popular &quot;Rapid Review&quot; book for pathology, and audio files of his lectures are used by medical students around the country.

==Academics==
OSU-CHS offers a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree. The first and second years of medical school at OSU focus on the basic sciences, and are primarily classroom based. Courses include biochemistry, immunology, microbiology, pharmacology, and osteopathic manipulative medicine. The third and fourth years of medical training are clinically oriented, consisting of clinical clerkships, where students rotate through various specialties of medicine. These rotations, which provide opportunities for students to develop clinical skills, include: internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, and osteopathic manipulative medicine.

Osteopathic medical students at OSU may choose to complete an additional degree to the DO degree. Combined degree programs include: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Science, Master of Business Administration, and Master of Public Health (MPH).

OSU-CHS also offers master&#x27;s degrees in physician assistant studies, health care administration, global health, forensic science, biomedical science and athletic training.

In 2021, several OSU-CHS healthcare programs were highly ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2022 rankings. The institution was ranked seventh in health shortage areas and tenth in rural care. Its primary care program was ranked 42nd in primary care production and 13th in diversity.

===Accreditation===
OSU-CHS is accredited by the American Osteopathic Association&#x27;s Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation.

== Second campus ==
The Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences opened the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine at the Cherokee Nation in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Classes commenced in the fall of 2020. This is the first Native American tribally-affiliated medical school in the United States, graduating its first class in May of 2024.

<text>Berdon syndrome, also called Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIH syndrome), is a generally fatal autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting the bladder, colon, and intestines.

It is more prevalent in females (7 females to 3 males) and is characterized by constipation and urinary retention, microcolon, giant bladder (megacystis), intestinal hypoperistalsis, hydronephrosis, and dilated small bowel. The pathological findings consist of an abundance of ganglion cells in both dilated and narrow areas of the intestine. It is a familial disturbance of unknown cause.

Walter Berdon &quot;et al.&quot; in 1976 first described the condition in five female infants, two of whom were sisters. All had marked dilatation of the bladder and some had hydronephrosis and the external appearance of prune belly. The infants also had microcolon and dilated small intestines.

==Signs and symptoms==

==Genetics==
Several genes are known to be implicated in this syndrome: these include &quot;ACTG2&quot;, &quot;LMOD1&quot;, &quot;MYH11&quot; and &quot;MYLK&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
Berdon syndrome is generally diagnosed after birth by the signs and symptoms as well as radiological and surgical findings. It can be diagnosed in the womb by ultrasound, revealing the enlarged bladder and hydronephrosis.

==Treatment==
Long-term survival with Berdon syndrome usually requires parenteral nutrition and urinary catheterisation or diversion. Most long-term survivors also have ileostomies. A multivisceral transplant (stomach, pancreas, small bowel, liver and large intestine) has also been successful. In a 2011 study of 227 children with the syndrome, &quot;the oldest survivor [was] 24 years old.&quot;

<doc id="1181356" wikidata="Q1536384" url="?curid=1181356" title="National Council of Resistance of Iran">
<text>The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI; ) is an Iranian political organization based in France and Albania and was founded by Massoud Rajavi and Abolhassan Banisadr. The organization is a political coalition calling to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran. The coalition is made up of different Iranian dissident groups, with its main member being the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). It is currently led by Maryam Rajavi.

The NCRI is also recognized as the MEK&#x27;s diplomatic wing. In 2002, the NCRI exposed the existence of an undisclosed uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, leading to concerns about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. It was listed as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, but was removed from this list in 2012 by the U.S. government.

== Platform&#x27;s core concepts ==

* Elections founded on the concept of &quot;universal suffrage&quot;.
* Fostering a diverse political system with &quot;respect for individual freedoms&quot;, &quot;freedom of expression&quot;, and &quot;free assembly&quot;.
* Eradicating the death penalty.
* Separating religious institutions (mosques) from the state, while forbidding religious discrimination.
* Complete gender equality for women in Iran.
* Modernizing the justice system in Iran, abolishing &quot;Sharia law&quot;, and introducing reforms that provide new legal protections.
* Committing to the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; (and &quot;autonomy for Iranian Kurdistan&quot;)
* Implementing measures that protect &quot;investment and employment&quot;, &quot;private property&quot;, and help bolster a market economy.
* Foreign policy grounded on the concept of &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; with other nations.
* Rejecting the pursuit and development of nuclear weapons.
* Rejecting the possession and development of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
President Abolhassan Banisadr was supportive of the MEK and believed the clerics should not govern Iran directly, and was removed from power. The government of Khomeini prevented Massoud Rajavi and MEK members from participating in the elections. In June 1981, the parliament (Majles-e-Shora-ye-Eslami) ousted president Abolhassan Banisadr through an impeachment. Both Massoud Rajavi and Banisdar escaped Iran in 1981 during a campaign by the Iranian government to eradicate the MEK from Iran. Rajavi and Banisadr exiled to Paris and founded the National Council of Resistance of Iran. The coalition was also joined by the National Democratic Front and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran.

The Foundation of the NCRI allowed Massoud Rajavi to &quot;assume the position of chairman of the resistance to the Islamic Republic and provided an outlet for the Mojahedin to codify its ideological models for a future government to replace that of the mullahs.&quot; Banisadr left the coalition in March 1983. In January 1983, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq Tariq Aziz and NCRI President Massoud Rajavi signed a peace plan &quot;based on an agreement of mutual recognition of borders as defined by the 1975 Algiers Agreement.&quot; According to James Piazza, this peace initiative became the NCRI&#x27;s first diplomatic act as a &quot;true government in exile. In 1983, elements united with NCRI began to depart the alliance because of conflicts with the MEK. On 24 March 1983, Banisadr officially left the council.

In 1986, the French government closed down NCRI headquarters in Paris to improve relations with the Islamic Republic. Rajavi and the NCRI moved their main operations to Baghdad, Iraq.

===Under Maryam Rajavi leadership===
In 1993, Maryam Rajavi, the spouse of Massoud Rajavi and then General Secretary of the MEK, became president-elect of the NCRI.

In 1993, NCRI representative Mohammad Hossein Naghdi was killed in Italy by assassins. As a result, the European Parliament issued a condemnation of political murder against the Islamic Republic of Iran.

In 2002 the NCRI exposed nuclear facilities in Natanz and Arak in Iran. Iran was then declared &quot;in breach of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&quot;, which began to limit the nuclear program in Iran.

In 2003, French police rounded up 167 PMOI sympathizers and placed 24 people under formal investigation, including the NCRI president Maryam Rajavi. In 2014, after an 11-year probe, the French courts dropped the charges.

The NCRI has in the past three decades recorded and reported human rights violations in Iran to UN Special Rapporteurs, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International and other international human rights organisations.

In June 2020, a majority of members of the US House of Representatives backed a &quot;bipartisan resolution&quot; supporting Maryam Rajavi and the NCRI&#x27;s &quot;call for a secular, democratic Iran&quot; while &quot;condemning Iranian state-sponsored terrorism&quot;. The resolution, backed by 221 lawmakers (including Louie Gohmert and Sheila Jackson Lee), gave support to the Rajavi&#x27;s 10-point plan for Iran&#x27;s future (which include &quot;a universal right to vote, market economy, and a non-nuclear Iran&quot;) while calling on the prevention of &quot;malign activities of the Iranian regime&#x27;s diplomatic missions.&quot; A NCRI representative said that &quot;The fact that out of ten diplomats or agents of the Iranian regime expelled or jailed in Europe and the U.S. for terror plots over the past two years, eight of them were tied to operations against our movement, is a vivid testimony that the NCRI is the alternative to this regime.&quot; The resolution also called on the U.S. to stand &quot;with the people of Iran who are continuing to hold legitimate and peaceful protests&quot; against the Iranian government.

In February 2021 Belgian court in Antwerp sentenced Assadollah Assadi, who worked at the Iranian embassy in Vienna, to 20-year jail term for plotting to bomb a rally of NCRI outside Paris in June 2018. He was arrested in Germany in June 2018. A Belgian couple of Iranian origin was also arrested with explosives and a detonator. A fourth man, Belgian-Iranian poet Merhad Arefani, was arrested in Paris and accused of being an accomplice. All three were convicted in a Belgian court for taking part in the plot and given jail terms of 15 to 18 years.

==Global reception==

The NCRI received support from US Congress and US officials including Tom Ridge, Howard Dean, Michael Mukasey, Louis Freeh, Hugh Shelton, Rudy Giuliani, John Bolton, Bill Richardson, James L. Jones, Edward G. Rendell, Brian Binley, and Lt. General Thomas Mclenerney.

The NCRI, along with the MEK is regarded by the governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq as a terrorist organization, and was classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the United States, alleging that the NCRI &quot;is not a separate organization, but is instead, and has been, an integral part of the MEK at all relevant times&quot; and that the NCRI is &quot;the political branch&quot; of the MEK. However, it is no longer considered terrorist. On September 28, 2012, the US State Department formally removed MEK from its list of terrorist organizations in a decision made by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ahead of an October 1 deadline set by a US appeals court.

Dick Armey (the former House majority leader 1995–2003) suggested that the State Department wrongly included MEK in the terrorist list from the beginning. Alireza Jafarzadeh was its official representative in the US until the Washington office was closed by the US State Department in 2002 on the grounds that it was only a front group for the MEK by then listed as a terrorist organisation in the US. It has been alleged that the inclusion of NCRI and MEK in the list was a token offered to the Iranian government rather than based on the facts of the matter. According to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; &quot;Senior diplomats in the Clinton administration say the MEK figured prominently as a bargaining chip in a bridge-building effort with Tehran.&quot; The Journal added that: In 1997, the State Department added the MEK to a list of global terrorist organizations as &quot;a signal&quot; of the US&#x27;s desire for rapprochement with Tehran&#x27;s reformists, said Martin Indyk, who at the time was assistant secretary of state for Near East Affairs. President Khatami&#x27;s government &quot;considered it a pretty big deal,&quot; Indyk said.

The European Union in May 2004 implied that NCRI is part of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran and excluded the NCRI itself from a list of organisations considered to be terrorist organisations, including the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran &quot;minus the National Council of Resistance of Iran&quot; on its list of terrorist organisations.
On January 26, 2009, EU Council of Ministers agreed to remove the MEK from the EU terror list. The group said it was the outcome of a &quot;seven-year-long legal and political battle&quot;. The European Union had previously listed the MEK on its list but excluded the NCRI itself from the list of organizations considered to be terrorist organizations. According to some sources, it has an active global network, and engages in propaganda and lobbying in many Western capitals.
The Middle East department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in the United Kingdom stated in early 2006 that it is widely understood that &quot;Iran&#x27;s [nuclear] program, which was kept secret from the IAEA for 18 years, became public knowledge largely because of revelations of the NCRI, and this led to heightened international concern.&quot; At the same time Michael Axworthy, former head of the Iran section at the FCO, claimed that the NCRI is a &quot;tightly disciplined front organization for the MEK&quot; and deemed them unreliable.

In a meeting at the Council of Europe in April 2006, Maryam Rajavi elaborated on the movement&#x27;s vision for a future Iran and presented a Ten Point Plan for Future Iran, according to the organisation&#x27;s website. The plan has been supported by British MPs, some arguing that it is a potential programme that &quot;would transform Iran&quot; since it calls for the abolition of the death penalty, the creation of a modern legal system and the independence of judges. At a debate on the human rights situation in Iran in the House of Lords on December 8, 2016, Lord Alton of Liverpool said, &quot;The manifesto says: Cruel and degrading punishments will have no place in the future Iran. Madam Rajavi would end Tehran&#x27;s funding of Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups and is committed to peaceful coexistence, relations with all countries and respect for the United Nations charter.&quot;

According to a RAND report, the NCRI was transformed from an umbrella organization into a MEK subsidiary. The NCRI says it fights for the establishment of a democratic and secular republic in Iran, on a platform espousing such political values as secular government, democratic elections, freedom of expression, equal rights for women and human rights. Also according to the RAND report, the NCRI has hidden the Marxist-Islamic elements, and practices gender segregation.

<text>Jennifer Kimball is a singer and songwriter who formed the folk duo The Story with Jonatha Brooke.

==Career==
Jennifer Kimball and Amherst College friend Jonatha Brooke began playing music together in the 1980s. They performed regularly during their college years. Their folk songs were marked by &quot;witty wordplay and sumptuous pop harmonies,&quot; according to one music critic. Critics noted a resemblance between their music and earlier artists such as Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon in terms of excellent musicianship, singing, and writing. Kimball graduated from Amherst in 1986.

They called themselves The Story. One critic wrote &quot;Jennifer Kimball played the Art Garfunkel role in The Story&quot; and contributed &quot;high ethereal harmonies.&quot; In 1989, the duo played the coffeehouse folk circuit and radio which exemplified the &quot;folk-rock singer-songwriter aesthetic,&quot; according to one account. Kimball and Brooke &quot;burst to fame&quot; with this combination. They created a demo called &quot;Over Oceans&quot; and were promptly signed to the independent label Green Linnet which, in 1991, issued the duo&#x27;s debut full-length album, &quot;Grace in Gravity&quot;. Later Elektra Records signed The Story and reissued their debut.

Their second album, &quot;The Angel in the House&quot;, was released in 1993. One critic raved about the &quot;exquisite arrangements and tricky, pitch-perfect harmonies by Ms. Brooke and her vocal partner, Jennifer Kimball,&quot; and added they &quot;are the last word in elegant folk-pop refinement.&quot; The album featured &quot;moody jazz and Brazilian-flavored arrangements&quot; and &quot;the duo&#x27;s harmonies, which usually begin in a comfortably folkish vein, frequently stray into precise chromatic dissonance&quot; and had a &quot;sophisticated international flavor.&quot; Their song &quot;Over Oceans&quot; was used as a background for dance by choreographer Kristen Caputo. The songs contemplate a woman&#x27;s conflicting desires for love and achievement and the need to shake off the romantic myth of a male rescuer.

Another critic discussed the contrast between the patter between songs and the songs themselves, noting the duo&#x27;s &quot;levity&quot; between heavy songs about &quot;God, church, death, female oppression, self-suppression, mothers and daughters.&quot; Their songs adroitly avoided &quot;heavy-handedness&quot; with a certain &quot;winning buoyancy of tune and/or spirit&quot; with &quot;sophisticated harmonic changes whose intriguing hooks come at you cockeyed and sideways more often than they swoop down from the heavens.&quot; The duo were compared with artists such as Suzanne Vega and Indigo Girls. Another reviewer gave the duo mixed reviews: &quot;intriguingly distorted harmonies and interesting turns of phrase&quot; but some &quot;attempts at cleverness overreached&quot; and there was &quot;a painfully obvious unrecorded song about dieting and a silly, albeit self-consciously so, stab at voguing a la Madonna.&quot; Another wrote their &quot;music can alternate between heart-rending poetry and infectious flights of fancy.&quot;

==Solo albums==
Kimball and Brooke dissolved their musical partnership in 1994, while Kimball performed her songs in a variety of venues and continued to write music.

In 1998, Kimball released the album &quot;Veering from the Wave&quot;. A Washington Post critic applauded the singing as &quot;handsome&quot; and the songwriting as excellent. In 1999, Kimball opened for folk artists such as Tom Rush. In 2000, she was a featured performer at the Eli Whitney Folk Festival in New Haven. Her song &quot;Meet Me in the Twilight&quot; received radio airplay, including on San Francisco station KPFA. She&#x27;s recorded with other artists including Wayfaring Strangers, Session Americana and Tony Trischka. Kimball&#x27;s music has been described as &quot;quirky and oh-so-urban suburban&quot; and a &quot;sultry roots singer&quot; with the &quot;aching breath of a mezzo.&quot;

Kimball released her CD &quot;Oh Hear Us&quot; in 2006. One critic wrote &quot;her songs still ripple with eccentric surprise, sudden twists, and &quot;A-ha!&quot; moments.&quot;

In 2007 she worked part-time as a horticulturalist and studied landscape design at Harvard. She commented: &quot;It&#x27;s a lovely way to keep the head &#x27;free&#x27; while working outside and dreaming up songs, designs, novels.&quot; She sang and played at Boston&#x27;s Lizard Lounge with musicians including guitarist Duke Levine, lap steel player Kevin Barry, drummer Bill Beard, bassist Richard Gates, and guest artists including Dennis Brennan, Kris Delmhorst, Rose Polenzani, Anne Heaton, and Rose Cousins.

Since 2009, Kimball has performed with Wintery Songs in Eleventy Part Harmony, a loose collective of Boston-area female musicians she initiated with Rose Polenzani to perform eclectic seasonal music. The group has featured core members such as Rose Cousins and Laura Cortese along with a revolving cast of collaborators that has included Catie Curtis, Sarah Jarosz and Aoife O&#x27;Donovan. The group released an eponymous EP in 2014 and a full-length album of original, traditional and modern seasonal songs, &quot;Hark&quot;, in 2015, with contributions from Kris Delmhorst and Anais Mitchell. The group continues to perform annual holiday shows each December. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described them as &quot;a veritable supergroup of some of the finest local singer-songwriters.&quot;

== Personal ==
At the beginning of her career, Kimball also worked as a children&#x27;s book designer for Little, Brown and she has also studied landscape design and ecology at Boston Architectural College. Kimball has performed to raise money for charitable organizations such as Massachusetts Families in Need and she supports the cause of helping women&#x27;s shelters. She is a mother with one son and lives in the Boston, Massachusetts area.

<text>Almanzo James Wilder (February 13, 1859 – October 23, 1949) was an American farmer as well as the husband of Laura Ingalls Wilder and the father of Rose Wilder Lane, both noted authors.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Wilder was born on his family&#x27;s homestead in rural Burke, New York, a few miles from the town of Malone. Most sources give Wilder&#x27;s birth date as February 13, 1857. However, federal and New York state census records support a birth year of 1859; Wilder may have given his birth year as 1857 when claiming land in Dakota Territory under the Homestead Act in 1879, which required claimants to be at least 21 years of age.

Wilder was the fifth of six children born to farmers James Mason (1813–1899) and Angelina Albina (née Day) Wilder (1821–1905). His siblings included Laura Ann (1844–1899), Royal Gould (1847–1925), Eliza Jane (1850–1930), Alice Maria (1853–1892), and Perley Day Wilder (1869–1934). As part of her &quot;Little House&quot; series of semi-autobiographical novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote a book titled &quot;Farmer Boy&quot; about Wilder&#x27;s childhood in upstate New York; he would subsequently become a recurring character in the later &quot;Little House&quot; books in which his wife wrote about their courtship and subsequent marriage, in &quot;The Long Winter&quot;, &quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot;, and &quot;The First Four Years,&quot; respectively. He also appears briefly in chapter 28 (&#x27;Moving Day&#x27;) of &quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot;. Almanzo is characterized as a quietly courageous, hardworking man who loves horses and farming, and is also described as an accomplished carpenter and woodworker.

&quot;Farmer Boy&quot; recounts events of Wilder&#x27;s childhood, starting when he was weeks shy of his ninth birthday in 1866. Among other things, he begins attending school when not needed at home for farm work, learns to train and drive a team of oxen, attends a county fair, and enjoys a mid-19th century Fourth of July celebration in the town of Malone. Almanzo also learns to deal with being bossed around by his older siblings, particularly his strong-willed sister Eliza Jane, who would later become a schoolteacher of his future wife.

&quot;Farmer Boy&quot; was the second book published in the &quot;Little House&quot; series. Hitting bookstore shelves in 1933, it was followed by &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; in 1935. The original order of publication was changed by publisher Harper with the subsequent release of the illustrated 1953 and 1971 editions.

=== Moving to the West ===
The Wilder family left Burke in 1870 due to crop failures. Moving west, they settled in Spring Valley, Minnesota, where they established a farm. In 1879, Wilder, his older brother Royal, and older sister Eliza Jane moved to the Dakota Territory, taking claims near what would later become the town of De Smet, South Dakota. Wilder settled on his homestead with the intent of planting acres of seed wheat which he had cultivated the previous summer on rented shares in Marshall, Minnesota. It was in De Smet that he first met Laura Ingalls. The Ingalls family had been one of the first settlers in the area, before the town was formally organized. They moved to the Dakota Territory from Walnut Grove, Minnesota, when Charles Ingalls took a temporary job with the railroad.

Wilder is portrayed as a hero in his wife&#x27;s book &quot;The Long Winter&quot;. Along with Ed &quot;Cap&quot; Garland, Wilder risked his life to save the citizens of De Smet from starvation during the long, hard winter of 1880–81. In between storms of a winter of unusually frequent and severe blizzards, which prevented trains from bringing food and supplies to the town, they went into the open prairie in search of wheat that a farmer was said to have harvested somewhere to the southwest of De Smet. The two men found the farmer and, after a difficult negotiation, persuaded him to sell them sixty bushels of wheat. Hauling the life-saving grain on sleds that continually broke through the snow into slough grass, they just made it back to De Smet before another four-day blizzard hit the area.

=== Marriage to Laura Ingalls ===
When Wilder was 23 years old and Ingalls was 15, the two began courting. Wilder would drive Ingalls back and forth between De Smet and a new settlement outside town, where she was teaching school and boarding. Then, when spring arrived, the couple would go for long buggy rides. Three years later, on August 25, 1885, Wilder and Ingalls were married in De Smet by the Reverend Edward Brown. They settled on Wilder&#x27;s claim and began their own small farming operations. The Wilders&#x27; daughter, Rose, was born December 5, 1886. Rose Wilder later became known as the author Rose Wilder Lane, a noted political writer and philosopher.

During their first years of marriage, described in &quot;The First Four Years&quot;, the Wilders were plagued by bad weather, illness, and large debts. In the spring of 1888, Wilder and his wife were both stricken with diphtheria. Although they both survived, Wilder suffered from one of the less common, late complications of the illness, neuritis. Areas of Wilder&#x27;s legs were temporarily paralyzed, and after the paralysis had resolved, he needed a cane to walk. His inability to perform the hard physical labor associated with wheat farming in South Dakota, combined with a lengthy drought in the late 1880s and early 1890s, further contributed to the Wilders&#x27; downward spiral into insolvency.

The year 1889 proved the breaking point for the Wilders. In early August, Laura gave birth to a son. The child remained unnamed when, two weeks later, he suddenly died of &quot;convulsions.&quot; Laura Ingalls Wilder never spoke of his death, and the couple did not have another child.

In the same month, the little family lost their home to a fire and their crops to drought. According to Rose Wilder Lane, &quot;It took seven successive years of complete crop failure, with work, weather and sickness that wrecked his health permanently, and interest rates of 36 percent on money borrowed to buy food, to dislodge us from that land.&quot;

In 1890, the Wilder family moved to Spring Valley, Minnesota, to stay with his parents on their farm. It was a time of rest and recovery for the weary family. Between 1891 and 1892, the family again moved, this time to Westville, Florida. They hoped a warmer climate would help Wilder regain his strength. Ultimately, while the warmer temperatures did help him recover, his wife did not like the humid climate or the customs of the backwoods locals.

They returned to De Smet in 1892, and rented a small house in town. Between 1892 and 1894, the Wilders lived in De Smet, with the Ingalls family nearby. Laura Ingalls Wilder worked as a seamstress in a dressmaker&#x27;s shop, while Wilder found work as a carpenter and day laborer. Together, they practiced frugality and carefully saved their money.

=== Settling in Missouri and later years ===

On July 17, 1894, the Wilders left De Smet for the Ozarks of Missouri by covered wagon, attracted by brochures of &quot;The Land of the Big Red Apple&quot; and stories of a local man who had traveled to Missouri to see the area for himself. On August 31, they arrived near Mansfield, Missouri, and Wilder placed a $100 down payment on 40 acres (16.2 ha) of hilly, rocky undeveloped land that his wife aptly named &quot;Rocky Ridge Farm.&quot; The farm would be the couple&#x27;s final home. Over the span of 20 years, Wilder built his wife what she later referred to as her dream house: a unique 10-room home in which he custom-built kitchen cabinets to accommodate her small, five-foot (1.52 m) frame.

Rocky Ridge Farm was eventually expanded to about 200 acres (80.9 ha) and was a productive poultry, dairy, and fruit farm. Wilder&#x27;s lifetime love of Morgan horses was indulged, and he also kept a large herd of cows and goats. Having learned a hard lesson by focusing on wheat farming in South Dakota, the Wilders chose a more diversified approach to farming suited to the climate of the Ozarks. Almanzo Wilder lived out the rest of his life on his farm, and both he and his wife were active in various community and church pursuits during their time in Missouri.

Although royalties from the &quot;Little House&quot; books helped provide for the Wilders, their daughter helped support them until the mid-1930s. Eventually their efforts at Rocky Ridge during the 1930s and 1940s, along with the book royalties finally provided a secure enough income to allow them to attain a financial stability they had not known earlier in their marriage. When they were first married, Wilder&#x27;s wife had helped contribute to their income by taking in occasional boarders, writing columns for a rural newspaper, and serving as Treasurer/Loan Officer for a Farm Loan Association. Their daughter lived with the Wilders on the farm for long periods of time, seeing that electricity and other modern updates were brought to the place, even having an English-style stone cottage built for them, and then taking over the farm house for about ten years.

Wilder learned to drive an automobile, which greatly improved their ability to leave the farm. The couple took several long auto trips, with destinations such as California and the Pacific Northwest, and went several times to visit the remaining Ingalls family in South Dakota. When their daughter moved permanently to Connecticut around 1937, the Wilders quickly returned to their beloved farm house, later selling off the eastern land with the stone cottage.

Wilder spent his last years happily tending small vegetable and flower gardens, indulging his lifetime love of woodworking and carpentry and tending his goats. He aided his wife in greeting the carloads of &quot;Little House&quot; fans who regularly found their way to Rocky Ridge Farm.

Wilder died on October 23, 1949, after suffering two heart attacks. Laura Ingalls Wilder died eight years later, on February 10, 1957. Their daughter, Rose Wilder Lane lived until 1968. All three are buried in Mansfield, and many of Wilder&#x27;s possessions and handiwork can be seen today at Rocky Ridge Farm, as well as the Malone, New York, and Spring Valley, Minnesota, farm sites. The Rocky Ridge Farm is known today as the Laura Ingalls Wilder/Rose Wilder Lane Museum.

From the accounts left by his wife and daughter, Almanzo Wilder appears to have been a quiet, stoic man, representative of the time and culture in which he lived. His love of farming, horses, and rural living are well documented within his family and friends&#x27; written recollections.

===Family tree===




=== Name origin ===
In one of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s books, &quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot;, the attribution of her husband&#x27;s unusual first name reads thus:

It was wished on me. My folks have got a notion there always has to be an Almanzo in the family, because &#x27;way back in the time of the Crusades there was a Wilder went to them, and an Arab or somebody saved his life. El Manzoor, the name was. They changed it after a while in England.
==In the media==
===Books===
Laura Ingalls Wilder published in 1933 the novel &quot;Farmer Boy&quot;, a mostly fictional account based on one year from Almanzo&#x27;s childhood. Heather Williams wrote and published, in 2012, &quot;Farmer Boy Goes West&quot;, another (and even more) fictional book based on Almanzo&#x27;s childhood.

===Television===
Wilder was portrayed in the television adaptations of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; by :
* Dean Butler, in the television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and its movie sequels,
* Walton Goggins, in &quot;Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot; films.

==Legacy==
The boyhood home of Almanzo Wilder near Malone, New York, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Operated and sustained by the Almanzo &amp; Laura Ingalls Wilder Association, the homestead is an interactive educational center, museum, and working farm.

<text>In 1933, the Great Western Railway introduced the first of what was to become a successful series of diesel railcars, which survived in regular use into the 1960s, when they were replaced with the new British Rail &quot;first generation&quot; type diesel multiple units.

==Design==

===Bodywork===
The original design featured streamlined bodywork, which was very much the fashion at the time. The rounded lines of the first examples built led to their nickname: &quot;flying banana&quot;. The preserved W4W is an example of the original, rounded body shape. Later &quot;razor edge&quot; examples, such as No. 27 (pictured), had much more angular (and practical) bodywork, yet the nickname persisted for these too.

===Heating===
The interiors of railcars No. 1 to No. 18 were heated by using waste heat from the engine cooling water. This system proved unreliable in service due to issues with the thermostatic valves employed. Later vehicles from No. 19 onward abandoned this system due to its unreliability and because their revised specification demanded that they be able to haul steam-heated rolling stock.

These later vehicles, No. 19 onwards, were equipped with steam heating systems which were capable of heating both the vehicle&#x27;s interior and that of any additional trailed vehicles, via a steam supply to the standard steam heating equipment. Steam was produced by a fully automatic Vapor Clarkson steam generator manufactured by Gresham and Craven Ltd under licence from the Vapor car co. The generator was of the water tube with counterflow arrangement type, and could supply up to 300 lb of steam per hour, at 45 lb per square inch. The quantity of steam supplied could be varied by the driver to suit the demand required by a solo railcar, or plus one, or plus two, trailer vehicles. The fuel was the same diesel as was used by the railcar&#x27;s engines, drawn from a separate 45-gallon tank. The water supply for the heating system was a single 100-gallon tank.

===Powertrain===
Railcars No. 1 to No. 18 were powered by a high-speed diesel engine manufactured by A.E.C, producing a maximum brake power output of 130 hp (97 kW). The engine was of the straight 6 configuration, with a bore of 115 mm diameter and a stroke of 142 mm. This gave a total displacement of 8.85 litres. The maximum operating speed was 1,800 rpm.

Railcars No. 19 onwards were powered by a modified version of the previous engine. This engine was equipped with direct injection and the bore diameter was enlarged to 120 mm, the stroke remaining at 142 mm. This engine produced a lower brake power output of 105 hp at 1,650 rpm.

An unusual feature was the external cardan shaft drive from the gearbox on the rear of a horizontally mounted engine to road-vehicle style reduction boxes outboard of the two axles on one bogie. Later units had two such engine-and-drive combinations placed on opposite sides. Railcars 19–20 were fitted with a separate high-low ratio gearbox on the final drive side of the gearbox, which allowed a top speed of about in high and about in low. Railcar W20W retains this in preservation.

===Brakes===

The brake system on railcars No. 2, 3 and 4 was unconventional. Instead of the usual vacuum-actuated tread brakes used on most British rolling stock of the period, an automotive-style system was adopted, utilising vacuum-hydraulically actuated drum brakes. A vacuum brake cylinder and hydraulic master cylinder set was mounted on each bogie. From the master cylinder, hydraulic fluid passed through hoses to the operating cylinders. The operating cylinders actuated cam mechanisms within the brake drums to apply the internally expanding brake shoes to the inside circumference of the drums. The 20 inch internal diameter cast steel brake drums were bolted to the inside face of one wheel per axle. 

The vacuum necessary for brake operation was created by three rotary exhausters, two being driven directly from the engines (one by each engine). The third exhauster was chain-driven by the final drive shaft. This arrangement allowed vacuum to be maintained during coasting, when the engines would be shut down. The system operated at a vacuum of 22 to 24 inches of mercury, stored in four reservoirs on the chassis. Another unusual aspect to this system was that vacuum was increased in the vacuum brake cylinder to apply the brakes, this being contrary to normal British railway practice, in which the vacuum is reduced to apply the brakes. 

==Operational history==
The prototype unit, No. 1, made its first run on 1 December 1933 between London Paddington and with a large number of press representatives. Three days later this unit entered public service between , Windsor and .

Soon after this, the GWR ordered the next three production units, Nos. 2 to 4, which were built with two engines (instead of one) which allowed them to reach a maximum speed of , and included a buffet. These units were delivered in July 1934 and entered service on 15 July 1934 between and . This was the first long-distance diesel express service in Britain, and covered the miles between Birmingham and Cardiff in 2 hours 20 minutes. This was intended as a businessman&#x27;s service; fares were charged at the normal rate, although bookings were limited by the 44 seats of the railcar.

The next three units, Nos. 5 to 7, entered service in July 1935 and had 70 seats. They were used on services between London, Oxford and Hereford. The next batches of railcars numbered 8 to 34 were of various designs and entered service in batches between 1936 and 1941. Two of these (17 and 34) were designed for express parcels services rather than passenger services.

The earlier units operated as single railcars. The final four, numbered 35 to 38, were twin coupled units with the driving cabs at the outer ends of the set, and were the forerunners of today&#x27;s diesel multiple units. These had the capacity for 104 passengers, and a standard corridor coach could be installed between the two cars to increase the seating capacity to 184. These were introduced in November 1941 and worked the Birmingham-Cardiff service.

==Fleet list==

Five of the 38 railcars were destroyed by fires:
*No 9 was burnt out at Heyford in July 1945; officially condemned in May 1946
*No 10 was burnt out at Bridgnorth in March 1956; officially condemned in May 1956
*No 35 and No 36 were destroyed by fire at St Anne&#x27;s Park, Bristol in April 1956; officially condemned in April 1957
*No 37 was damaged by fire in February 1949 and was stored until being scrapped; officially condemned in September 1949 

==Preservation==
Three of the GWR railcars have survived into preservation:

==Models==
Hornby Railways manufacture a model of the 1940-style railcar in OO gauge, using tooling acquired in their takeover of Lima. In late 2017, Dapol released an OO model of the streamlined 1936 Gloucester RCW railcars in a variety of liveries and numbers. Heljan manufacture a model of the 1940-style railcar in OO gauge, using new tooling, that includes internal lighting and front and rear lighting. 

Graham Farish produced an N-gauge model (with various numbers, e.g. 19, 22, and 20), both before and after their takeover by Bachmann.
