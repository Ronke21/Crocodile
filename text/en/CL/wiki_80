<text>Social stratification refers to a society&#x27;s categorization of its people into groups based on socioeconomic factors like wealth, income, race, education, ethnicity, gender, occupation, social status, or derived power (social and political). It is a hierarchy within groups that ascribe them to different levels of privileges. As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit.

In modern Western societies, social stratification is defined in terms of three social classes: an upper class, a middle class, and a lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into an upper-stratum, a middle-stratum, and a lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship, clan, tribe, or caste, or all four.

The categorization of people by social stratum occurs most clearly in complex state-based, polycentric, or feudal societies, the latter being based upon socio-economic relations among classes of nobility and classes of peasants. Whether social stratification first appeared in hunter-gatherer, tribal, and band societies or whether it began with agriculture and large-scale means of social exchange remains a matter of debate in the social sciences. Determining the structures of social stratification arises from inequalities of status among persons, therefore, the degree of social inequality determines a person&#x27;s social stratum. Generally, the greater the social complexity of a society, the more social stratification exists, by way of social differentiation.

Stratification can yield various consequences. For instance, the stratification of neighborhoods based on spatial and racial factors can influence disparate access to mortgage credit.

==Overview==

===Definition and usage===

&quot;Social stratification&quot; is a concept used in the social sciences to describe the relative social position of persons in a given social group, category, geographical region or other social unit. It derives from the Latin &quot;strātum&quot; (plural &#x27;strata&#x27;; parallel, horizontal layers) referring to a given society&#x27;s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth, income, social status, occupation and power. In modern Western societies, stratification is often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Each of these classes can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. &quot;upper middle&quot;). Social strata may also be delineated on the basis of kinship ties or caste relations.

The concept of social stratification is often used and interpreted differently within specific theories. In sociology, for example, proponents of action theory have suggested that social stratification is commonly found in developed societies, wherein a dominance hierarchy may be necessary in order to maintain social order and provide a stable social structure. Conflict theories, such as Marxism, point to the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility found in stratified societies. Many sociological theorists have criticized the fact that the working classes are often unlikely to advance socioeconomically while the wealthy tend to hold political power which they use to exploit the proletariat (laboring class). Talcott Parsons, an American sociologist, asserted that stability and social order are regulated, in part, by universal values. Such values are not identical with &quot;consensus&quot; but can indeed be an impetus for social conflict, as has been the case multiple times through history. Parsons never claimed that universal values, in and by themselves, &quot;satisfied&quot; the functional prerequisites of a society. Indeed, the constitution of society represents a much more complicated codification of emerging historical factors. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf alternately note the tendency toward an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies due to the necessity of an educated workforce in technological economies. Various social and political perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest that these effects are due to changes in the status of workers to the third world.

===Four underlying principles===
Four principles are posited to underlie social stratification. First, social stratification is socially defined as a property of a society rather than individuals in that society. Second, social stratification is reproduced from generation to generation. Third, social stratification is universal (found in every society) but variable (differs across time and place). Fourth, social stratification involves not just quantitative inequality but qualitative beliefs and attitudes about social status.

===Complexity===
Although stratification is not limited to complex societies, all complex societies exhibit features of stratification. In any complex society, the total stock of valued goods is distributed unequally, wherein the most privileged individuals and families enjoy a disproportionate share of income, power, and other valued social resources. The term &quot;stratification system&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the complex social relationships and social structures that generate these observed inequalities. The key components of such systems are: (a) social-institutional processes that define certain types of goods as valuable and desirable, (b) the rules of allocation that distribute goods and resources across various positions in the division of labor (e.g., physician, farmer, &#x27;housewife&#x27;), and (c) the social mobility processes that link individuals to positions and thereby generate unequal control over valued resources.

===Social mobility===

Social mobility is the movement of individuals, social groups or categories of people between the layers or within a stratification system. This movement can be intragenerational or intergenerational. Such mobility is sometimes used to classify different systems of social stratification. Open stratification systems are those that allow for mobility between, typically by placing value on the achieved status characteristics of individuals. Those societies having the highest levels of intragenerational mobility are considered to be the most open and malleable systems of stratification. Those systems in which there is little to no mobility, even on an intergenerational basis, are considered closed stratification systems. For example, in caste systems, all aspects of social status are ascribed, such that one&#x27;s social position at birth persists throughout one&#x27;s lifetime.

====Karl Marx====

In Marxist theory, the modern mode of production consists of two main economic parts: the base and the superstructure. The base encompasses the relations of production: employer–employee work conditions, the technical division of labour, and property relations. Social class, according to Marx, is determined by one&#x27;s relationship to the means of production. There exist at least two classes in any class-based society: the owners of the means of production and those who sell their labor to the owners of the means of production. At times, Marx almost hints that the ruling classes seem to own the working class itself as they only have their own labor power (&#x27;wage labor&#x27;) to offer the more powerful in order to survive. These relations fundamentally determine the ideas and philosophies of a society and additional classes may form as part of the superstructure. Through the ideology of the ruling class—throughout much of history, the land-owning aristocracy—false consciousness is promoted both through political and non-political institutions but also through the arts and other elements of culture. When the aristocracy falls, the bourgeoisie become the owners of the means of production in the capitalist system. Marx predicted the capitalist mode would eventually give way, through its own internal conflict, to revolutionary consciousness and the development of more egalitarian, more communist societies.

Marx also described two other classes, the petite bourgeoisie and the lumpenproletariat. The petite bourgeoisie is like a small business class that never really accumulates enough profit to become part of the bourgeoisie, or even challenge their status. The lumpenproletariat is the underclass, those with little to no social status. This includes prostitutes, street gangs, beggars, the homeless or other untouchables in a given society. Neither of these subclasses has much influence in Marx&#x27;s two major classes, but it is helpful to know that Marx did recognize differences within the classes.

According to Marvin Harris and Tim Ingold, Lewis Henry Morgan&#x27;s accounts of egalitarian hunter-gatherers formed part of Karl Marx&#x27; and Friedrich Engels&#x27; inspiration for communism. Morgan spoke of a situation in which people living in the same community pooled their efforts and shared the rewards of those efforts fairly equally. He called this &quot;communism in living&quot;. But when Marx expanded on these ideas, he still emphasized an economically oriented culture, with property defining the fundamental relationships between people. Yet, issues of ownership and property are arguably less emphasized in hunter-gatherer societies. This, combined with the very different social and economic situations of hunter-gatherers may account for many of the difficulties encountered when implementing communism in industrialized states. As Ingold points out: &quot;The notion of communism, removed from the context of domesticity and harnessed to support a project of social engineering for large-scale, industrialized states with populations of millions, eventually came to mean something quite different from what Morgan had intended: namely, a principle of redistribution that would override all ties of a personal or familial nature, and cancel out their effects.&quot;

The counter-argument to Marxist&#x27;s conflict theory is the theory of structural functionalism, argued by Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore, which states that social inequality places a vital role in the smooth operation of a society. The Davis–Moore hypothesis argues that a position does not bring power and prestige because it draws a high income; rather, it draws a high income because it is functionally important and the available personnel is for one reason or another scarce. Most high-income jobs are difficult and require a high level of education to perform, and their compensation is a motivator in society for people to strive to achieve more.

====Max Weber====

Max Weber was strongly influenced by Marx&#x27;s ideas but rejected the possibility of effective communism, arguing that it would require an even greater level of detrimental social control and bureaucratization than capitalist society. Moreover, Weber criticized the dialectical presumption of a proletariat revolt, maintaining it to be unlikely. Instead, he develops a three-component theory of stratification and the concept of life chances. Weber held there are more class divisions than Marx suggested, taking different concepts from both functionalist and Marxist theories to create his own system. He emphasizes the difference between class, status, and party, and treats these as separate but related sources of power, each with different effects on social action. Working half a century later than Marx, Weber claims there to be four main social classes: the upper class, the white collar workers, the petite bourgeoisie, and the manual working class.

Weber derives many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of Germany. He notes that, contrary to Marx&#x27;s theories, stratification is based on more than simple ownership of capital. Weber examines how many members of the aristocracy lacked economic wealth yet had strong political power. Many wealthy families lacked prestige and power, for example, because they were Jewish. Weber introduced three independent factors that form his theory of stratification hierarchy, which are; class, status, and power:
* Class: A person&#x27;s economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber notes how corporate executives control firms they typically do not own; Marx would have placed these people in the proletariat despite their high incomes by virtue of the fact they sell their labor instead of owning capital.
* Status: A person&#x27;s prestige, social honor, or popularity in a society. Weber notes that political power is not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one&#x27;s individual status. Poets or saints, for example, can have extensive influence on society despite few material resources.
* Power: A person&#x27;s ability to get their way despite the resistance of others, particularly in their ability to engage social change. For example, individuals in government jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but still wield considerable social power.

====C. Wright Mills====
C. Wright Mills, drawing from the theories of Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca, contends that the imbalance of power in society derives from the complete absence of countervailing powers against corporate leaders of the power elite. Mills both incorporated and revised Marxist ideas. While he shared Marx&#x27;s recognition of a dominant wealthy and powerful class, Mills believed that the source for that power lay not only in the economic realm but also in the political and military arenas. During the 1950s, Mills stated that hardly anyone knew about the power elite&#x27;s existence, some individuals (including the elite themselves) denied the idea of such a group, and other people vaguely believed that a small formation of a powerful elite existed. &quot;Some prominent individuals knew that Congress had permitted a handful of political leaders to make critical decisions about peace and war; and that two atomic bombs had been dropped on Japan in the name of the United States, but neither they nor anyone they knew had been consulted.&quot;

Mills explains that the power elite embody a privileged class whose members are able to recognize their high position within society. In order to maintain their highly exalted position within society, members of the power elite tend to marry one another, understand and accept one another, and also work together.[pp. 4–5] The most crucial aspect of the power elite&#x27;s existence lays within the core of education. &quot;Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton but also to the universities&#x27; highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts.&quot;[pp. 63–67] Examples of elite members who attended prestigious universities and were members of highly exclusive clubs can be seen in George W. Bush and John Kerry. Both Bush and Kerry were members of the Skull and Bones club while attending Yale University. This club includes members of some of the most powerful men of the twentieth century, all of which are forbidden to tell others about the secrets of their exclusive club. Throughout the years, the Skull and Bones club has included presidents, cabinet officers, Supreme Court justices, spies, captains of industry, and often their sons and daughters join the exclusive club, creating a social and political network like none ever seen before.

The upper class individuals who receive elite educations typically have the essential background and contacts to enter into the three branches of the power elite: The political leadership, the military circle, and the corporate elite.
* The Political Leadership: Mills held that, prior to the end of World War II, leaders of corporations became more prominent within the political sphere along with a decline in central decision-making among professional politicians.
* The Military Circle: During the 1950s–1960s, increasing concerns about warfare resulted in top military leaders and issues involving defense funding and military personnel training becoming a top priority within the United States. Most of the prominent politicians and corporate leaders have been strong proponents of military spending.
* The Corporate Elite: Mills explains that during the 1950s, when the military emphasis was recognized, corporate leaders worked with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies. Corporate leaders and high-ranking military officers were mutually supportive of each other.[pp. 274–276]

Mills shows that the power elite has an &quot;inner-core&quot; made up of individuals who are able to move from one position of institutional power to another; for example, a prominent military officer who becomes a political adviser or a powerful politician who becomes a corporate executive. &quot;These people have more knowledge and a greater breadth of interests than their colleagues. Prominent bankers and financiers, who Mills considered &#x27;almost professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs,&#x27; are also members of the elite&#x27;s inner core.[pp. 288–289]

===Anthropological theories===

Most if not all anthropologists dispute the &quot;universal&quot; nature of social stratification, holding that it is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy (2006) writes, &quot;Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples. Non-stratified egalitarian or acephalous (&quot;headless&quot;) societies exist which have little or no concept of social hierarchy, political or economic status, class, or even permanent leadership.&quot;

===Kinship-orientation===
Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as &quot;kinship-oriented&quot;, because they appear to value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted with economically oriented cultures (including states) in which status and material wealth are prized, and stratification, competition, and conflict are common. Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could lead to conflict and instability. Reciprocal altruism is one process by which this is accomplished.

A good example is given by Richard Borshay Lee in his account of the Khoisan, who practice &quot;&quot;insulting the meat&quot;.&quot; Whenever a hunter makes a kill, he is ceaselessly teased and ridiculed (in a friendly, joking fashion) to prevent him from becoming too proud or egotistical. The meat itself is then distributed evenly among the entire social group, rather than kept by the hunter. The level of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill. Lee found this out when he purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with, and was teased for weeks afterward about it (since obtaining that much meat could be interpreted as showing off).

Another example is the Australian Aboriginals of Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island, off the coast of Arnhem Land, who have arranged their entire society—spiritually and economically—around a kind of gift economy called &quot;renunciation.&quot; According to David H. Turner, in this arrangement, every person is expected to give &quot;everything&quot; of any resource they have to any other person who needs or lacks it at the time. This has the benefit of largely eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty. However, misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal &quot;renunciative economics&quot; with the competition/scarcity-oriented economics introduced to Australia by European colonists.

==Variables in theory and research==

The social status variables underlying social stratification are based in social perceptions and attitudes about various characteristics of persons and peoples. While many such variables cut across time and place, the relative weight placed on each variable and specific combinations of these variables will differ from place to place over time. One task of research is to identify accurate mathematical models that explain how these many variables combine to produce stratification in a given society. Grusky (2011) provides a good overview of the historical development of sociological theories of social stratification and a summary of contemporary theories and research in this field. While many of the variables that contribute to an understanding of social stratification have long been identified, models of these variables and their role in constituting social stratification are still an active topic of theory and research. In general, sociologists recognize that there are no &quot;pure&quot; economic variables, as social factors are integral to economic value. However, the variables posited to affect social stratification can be loosely divided into economic and other social factors.

===Economic===
Strictly quantitative economic variables are more useful to describing social stratification than explaining how social stratification is constituted or maintained. Income is the most common variable used to describe stratification and associated economic inequality in a society. However, the distribution of individual or household accumulation of surplus and wealth tells us more about variation in individual well-being than does income, alone. Wealth variables can also more vividly illustrate salient variations in the well-being of groups in stratified societies. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), especially &quot;per capita&quot; GDP, is sometimes used to describe economic inequality and stratification at the international or global level.

===Social===
Social variables, both quantitative and qualitative, typically provide the most explanatory power in causal research regarding social stratification, either as independent variables or as intervening variables. Three important social variables include gender, race, and ethnicity, which, at the least, have an intervening effect on social status and stratification in most places throughout the world. Additional variables include those that describe other ascribed and achieved characteristics such as occupation and skill levels, age, education level, education level of parents, and geographic area. Some of these variables may have both causal and intervening effects on social status and stratification. For example, absolute age may cause a low income if one is too young or too old to perform productive work. The social perception of age and its role in the workplace, which may lead to ageism, typically has an intervening effect on employment and income.

Social scientists are sometimes interested in quantifying the degree of economic stratification between different social categories, such as men and women, or workers with different levels of education. An index of stratification has been recently proposed by Zhou for this purpose.

====Gender====
Gender is one of the most pervasive and prevalent social characteristics which people use to make social distinctions between individuals. Gender distinctions are found in economic-, kinship- and caste-based stratification systems. Social role expectations often form along sex and gender lines. Entire societies may be classified by social scientists according to the rights and privileges afforded to men or women, especially those associated with ownership and inheritance of property. In patriarchal societies, such rights and privileges are normatively granted to men over women; in matriarchal societies, the opposite holds true. Sex- and gender-based division of labor is historically found in the annals of most societies and such divisions increased with the advent of industrialization. Sex-based wage discrimination exists in some societies such that men, typically, receive higher wages than women for the same type of work. Other differences in employment between men and women lead to an overall gender-based pay-gap in many societies, where women as a category earn less than men due to the types of jobs which women are offered and take, as well as to differences in the number of hours worked by women. These and other gender-related values affect the distribution of income, wealth, and property in a given social order.

====Race====
Racism consists of both prejudice and discrimination based in social perceptions of observable biological differences between peoples. It often takes the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different races are perceived to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. In a given society, those who share racial characteristics socially perceived as undesirable are typically under-represented in positions of social power, i.e., they become a minority category in that society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including assimilation, exclusion, oppression, expulsion, and extermination. Overt racism usually feeds directly into a stratification system through its effect on social status. For example, members associated with a particular race may be assigned a slave status, a form of oppression in which the majority refuses to grant basic rights to a minority that are granted to other members of the society. More covert racism, such as that which many scholars posit is practiced in more contemporary societies, is socially hidden and less easily detectable. Covert racism often feeds into stratification systems as an intervening variable affecting income, educational opportunities, and housing. Both overt and covert racism can take the form of structural inequality in a society in which racism has become institutionalized.

====Ethnicity====
Ethnic prejudice and discrimination operate much the same as do racial prejudice and discrimination in society. In fact, only recently have scholars begun to differentiate race and ethnicity; historically, the two were considered to be identical or closely related. With the scientific development of genetics and the human genome as fields of study, most scholars now recognize that race is socially defined on the basis of biologically determined characteristics that can be observed within a society while ethnicity is defined on the basis of culturally learned behavior. Ethnic identification can include shared cultural heritage such as language and dialect, symbolic systems, religion, mythology and cuisine. As with race, ethnic categories of persons may be socially defined as minority categories whose members are under-represented in positions of social power. As such, ethnic categories of persons can be subject to the same types of majority policies. Whether ethnicity feeds into a stratification system as a direct, causal factor or as an intervening variable may depend on the level of ethnographic centrism within each of the various ethnic populations in a society, the amount of conflict over scarce resources, and the relative social power held within each ethnic category.

===Global stratification===
Globalizing forces lead to rapid international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and its modern representation the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities.

Like a stratified class system within a nation, looking at the world economy one can see class positions in the unequal distribution of capital and other resources between nations. Rather than having separate national economies, nations are considered as participating in this world economy. The world economy manifests a global division of labor with three overarching classes: core countries, semi-periphery countries and periphery countries, according to World-systems and Dependency theories. Core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks and provide international financial services. Periphery nations own very little of the world&#x27;s means of production (even when factories are located in periphery nations) and provide low to non-skilled labor. Semiperipheral nations are midway between the core and periphery. They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies.

Core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the least. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from noncore nations at low prices, while demanding higher prices for their exports to noncore nations. A global workforce employed through a system of global labor arbitrage ensures that companies in core countries can utilize the cheapest semi-and non-skilled labor for production.

Today we have the means to gather and analyze data from economies across the globe. Although many societies worldwide have made great strides toward more equality between differing geographic regions, in terms of the standard of living and life chances afforded to their peoples, we still find large gaps between the wealthiest and the poorest within a nation and between the wealthiest and poorest nations of the world. A January 2014 Oxfam report indicates that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world&#x27;s population, or about 3.5 billion people. By contrast, for 2012, the World Bank reports that 21 percent of people worldwide, around 1.5 billion, live in extreme poverty, at or below $1.25 a day. Zygmunt Bauman has provocatively observed that the rise of the rich is linked to their capacity to lead highly mobile lives: &quot;Mobility climbs to the rank of the uppermost among coveted values—and the freedom to move, perpetually a scarce and unequally distributed commodity, fast becomes the main stratifying factor of our late modern or postmodern time.&quot;

<text>Guy George Egerton Wylly, (17 February 1880 – 9 January 1962) was a senior British Indian Army officer and an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for actions during the Second Boer War.

==Early life==
Wylly was born on 17 February 1880 in Hobart, Tasmania, to Edward Arthur Egerton Wylly; an officer in the Indian Army, and his wife Henrietta Mary, née Clerk.

As an infant Wylly went to India with his parents, before settling at Sandy Bay, Hobart in 1885, where he attended The Hutchins School before completing his education at the Collegiate School of St Peter, Adelaide. His father retired from the army in 1888.

==Boer War==
As a 20-year-old, he became a lieutenant in the Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen, raised to fight in the Second Boer War.

On 1 September 1900 near Warm Bad, Transvaal, South Africa, Lieutenant Wylly was part of a force under Herbert Plumer which engaged a small group of Boers at Rooikop. The Imperial forces captured 100 rifles, 40,000 rounds of ammunition, 7 Boers, 350 cattle, and 2 supply wagons. After the engagement, Wylly was reported to have been severely wounded, along with another Tasmanian officer, and 3 men from the Bushmen.

On 18 September 1900, &quot;The London Gazette&quot; carried an announcement that Wylly had been granted a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Berkshire Regiment, on the nomination of the Governor of Tasmania, backdated to 19 May 1900. On 16 November, this appointment was cancelled for some reason. On 23 November his VC was gazetted, with the following citation:

On 5 December, came a new commission as a second lieutenant, now in the South Lancashire Regiment. Confusingly, &quot;The Times&quot; of 14 January 1901 listed in a report of killed and wounded &quot;2nd Berkshire Regiment.—Lieut. G. Wylly, dangerously wounded, doing well, Nooitgedacht, date not stated.&quot; Whether this was a new wound, or he had not yet recovered from the wound he received in September, his condition was such that he was invalided to England, leaving Cape Town on 5 March 1901, on the hospital ship &quot;Avoca&quot;, which arrived at Southampton on 26 March. The report of this also indicates that he was serving with 2nd Battalion, South Lancs. By the following Sunday, 31 March, when the United Kingdom Census 1901 was taken, he was staying with his uncle, Robert M Clark, a retired colonel, at Charlton House in Shepton Mallet. He was presented with his VC at Buckingham Palace by King Edward VII on 25 July 1901.

On 5 March 1902 he was promoted to lieutenant in the South Lancashire Regiment. He transferred to the Indian Army on 1 October 1902.

On 7 January 1906 Wylly was appointed the aide-de-camp to the commander in chief, India, who was then Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. Wylly had been serving with the Corps of Guides. He was promoted captain on 26 April 1909. In 1913 he passed the examination for entry to the Staff College, Quetta, but not high enough up the list to be admitted immediately.

==First World War and after==
Four months after the British entry into World War I, he was appointed a staff captain on 14 December 1914, and advanced to brigade major on 14 September 1915. He finally completed the staff course at Quetta in February 1916, was promoted to temporary major on 26 April 1916, and on 20 June 1916 he was appointed a general staff officer, Grade 2. He was Mentioned in Despatches on 15 June 1916. Following Lord Kitchener&#x27;s death, Wylly, along with others who had also served as Kitchener&#x27;s aides, received a bequest of £200. He received a further Mention in Despatches on 15 May 1917, and again on 11 December 1917. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours.

The war came to an end on 11 November 1918 and, during the Third Anglo-Afghan War, Wylly again served as a general staff officer, Grade 2 from 6 May 1919. He was promoted lieutenant colonel on 26 April 1926. From 15 November 1926 until his retirement in 1933, Wylly was an aide-de-camp to King George V. On 9 November 1929 he was appointed an assistant adjutant and quartermaster general (AA &amp; QMG) in India, he had also by now been given brevet promotion to colonel. He received substantive promotion to colonel on 26 April 1930, with seniority from 15 November 1926. On 6 May 1931 he was Mentioned in Despatches for his part in the campaign against the Afridi and Red Shirt Rebellion as AA &amp; QMG Peshawar District. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1933 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He received a further Mention on 8 September 1933 for his part in the Chitral Reliefs. He stepped down as AA &amp; QMG of Peshawar on 9 November 1933, retired from the army on 30 December. A final Mention was gazetted on 3 July 1934, for his part in the Mohmand and Bajaur Operations between 28 July and 3 October 1933. He attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1934 to receive his insignia for the Order of the Bath. Following his retirement he worked for the Retired Army Officers Employment Bureau. Although he did not reach the age limit for service until 17 February 1940, he was not recalled for service in the Second World War.

He died on 9 January 1962 in Camberley, Surrey, at the age of 81.

<text>The Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM; formerly the National Museum of American Art) is a museum in Washington, D.C., part of the Smithsonian Institution. Together with its branch museum, the Renwick Gallery, SAAM holds one of the world&#x27;s largest and most inclusive collections of art made in the United States from the colonial period to the present. More than 7,000 artists are represented in the museum&#x27;s collection. Most exhibitions are held in the museum&#x27;s main building, the Old Patent Office Building (which is shared with the National Portrait Gallery), while craft-focused exhibitions are shown in the Renwick Gallery.
The museum provides electronic resources to schools and the public through its national education program. It maintains seven online research databases with more than 500,000 records, including the Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture that document more than 400,000 artworks in public and private collections worldwide. Since 1951, the museum has maintained a traveling exhibition program; as of 2013, more than 2.5 million visitors have seen the exhibitions. 

== Attendance ==
In 2022 the museum received 1,100,000 visitors, ranking it seventh in the List of most-visited museums in the United States.

==History==
The museum&#x27;s history can be traced to the creation of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. The act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian called for it to include &quot;a gallery of art&quot;. In its early years, however, little effort was put into developing the art collection, as Smithsonian Secretary Joseph Henry preferred to focus on scientific research. The collection was first on display in the original Smithsonian Building (now known as the Castle). In 1865, a fire destroyed much of the collection. Those art holdings that survived were mostly loaned to the Library of Congress and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in the following decades. In 1896, the artworks were brought back to the Smithsonian, after Congress appropriated money to construct a fireproof room for them.

The Smithsonian began to refer to its art collection as the National Gallery of Art in 1906, in connection with efforts to receive Harriet Lane Johnston&#x27;s art collection, which she had bequeathed to the &quot;national art gallery&quot;. The collection grew as the Smithsonian buildings grew, and the collection was housed in one or more Smithsonian buildings on the National Mall.

In 1920, the National Gallery of Art was separated from the National Museum, becoming its own branch of the Smithsonian, with William Henry Holmes as its first director. By this time, space had become critical: &quot;Collections to the value of several millions of dollars are in storage or temporarily on exhibition and are crowding out important exhibits and producing a congested condition in the Natural History, Industrial Arts, and Smithsonian Buildings&quot;. In 1924, architect Charles A. Platt drew up preliminary plans for a National Gallery of Art to be built on the block next to the Natural History Museum. However, this building was never constructed.

In 1937, the National Gallery of Art became the National Collection of Fine Arts (NCFA), because Andrew Mellon insisted that the previous moniker be given to a new institution formed through his donation of a large art collection.

By the 1950s, the NCFA still occupied a small space in the Natural History Building. In 1958, Congress finally granted the NCFA a home, the Old Patent Office Building, which was about to be vacated by the U.S. Civil Service Commission. The building would be shared with the planned National Portrait Gallery, with the NCFA occupying the northern half of the building. Renovation work on the building began in 1964. The NCFA opened in its new home on May 6, 1968.

The museum&#x27;s relocation came at an unfortunate time, as the neighborhood had been devastated a month earlier by the Martin Luther King assassination riots. The NCFA struggled to attract visitors over the following decades, as the streets around it remained bleak and lonely. This would remain a factor until the late 1990s, when the work of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation and the opening of the MCI Center (now Capital One Arena) across the street from the museum sparked a revitalization of the neighborhood.

The NCFA gained a new branch in 1972, opening the Renwick Gallery, dedicated to design and crafts, in a historic building near the White House.

In 1980, the name was changed to the National Museum of American Art, to better distinguish it from other federal art museums and to emphasize its focus on American artists. From 1982 to 1988, Charles C. Eldredge served as the museum director, followed by the tenures of Elizabeth Broun and Stephanie Stebich.

In January 2000, the museum closed to begin a planned three-year, $60-million renovation of the Patent Office Building. To keep the museum&#x27;s collection accessible to the public during the closure, many of the artworks were sent out in a &quot;Treasures to Go&quot; series of traveling exhibitions, billed as &quot;the largest museum tour in history&quot;. The museum&#x27;s name was changed to the Smithsonian American Art Museum in October 2000 so that the museum and its traveling exhibitions could benefit from the Smithsonian&#x27;s brand recognition.

After renovations were underway, the plans were broadened in an effort to restore much of the building&#x27;s original elegance. Many of the building&#x27;s exceptional architectural features were restored: porticos modeled after the Parthenon in Athens, a curving double staircase, colonnades, vaulted galleries, large windows, and skylights as long as a city block. New features added to the building included the Lunder Conservation Center, the Luce Foundation Center for American Art, Nan Tucker McEvoy Auditorium, and the Robert and Arlene Kogod Courtyard. Meanwhile, the museum&#x27;s offices, library, and storage were moved to the nearby Victor Building, freeing up valuable space and allowing the museum to display four times as many artworks as before. The renovation ultimately took six years and $283 million. The museum and the National Portrait Gallery reopened their combined building, renamed as the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture, on July 1, 2006.

==Affiliated museums==
===National Portrait Gallery===

The Smithsonian American Art Museum shares the historic Old Patent Office building with the National Portrait Gallery, another Smithsonian museum. Although the two museums&#x27; names have not changed, they are collectively known as the Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture.

===Renwick Gallery===
Also under the auspices of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Renwick Gallery is a smaller, historic building on Pennsylvania Avenue across the street from the White House. The building originally housed the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In addition to displaying a large collection of American contemporary craft, several hundred paintings from the museum&#x27;s permanent collection — hung salon style: one-atop-another and side-by-side — are featured in special installations in the Grand Salon.

==Features and programs==
===Collections===

Part of the Smithsonian Institution, the museum has a broad variety of American art, with more than 7,000 artists represented, that covers all regions and art movements found in the United States. SAAM contains the world&#x27;s largest collection of New Deal art; a collection of contemporary craft, American impressionist paintings, and masterpieces from the Gilded Age; photography, modern folk art, works by African American and Latino artists, images of western expansion, and realist art from the first half of the twentieth century. Among the significant artists represented in its collection are Nam June Paik, Jenny Holzer, David Hockney, Richard Hunt, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Ching Ho Cheng, John Singer Sargent, Albert Pinkham Ryder, Albert Bierstadt, Frances Farrand Dodge, Edmonia Lewis, Thomas Moran, James Gill, Edward Hopper, John William &quot;Uncle Jack&quot; Dey, Karen LaMonte and Winslow Homer.

SAAM describes itself as being &quot;dedicated to collecting, understanding, and enjoying American art. The museum celebrates the extraordinary creativity of artists whose works reflect the American experience and global connections.&quot;

===Galleries and public spaces===
The American Art&#x27;s main building contains expanded permanent-collection galleries and public spaces. The museum has two innovative public spaces. The Luce Foundation Center for American Art is a visible art storage and study center, which allows visitors to browse more than 3,300 works of the collection. The Lunder Conservation Center is &quot;the first art conservation facility to allow the public permanent behind-the-scenes views of the preservation work of museums&quot;.

====The Luce Foundation Center for American Art====

The Luce Foundation Center, which opened in July 2000, is the first visible art storage and study center in Washington, D.C., and the fourth center to bear the Luce Family name. It has 20,400 square feet on the third and fourth floors of American Art Museum.

It presents more than 3,300 objects in 64 secure glass cases, which quadruples the number of artworks from the permanent collection on public view. The purpose of open storage is to allow patrons to view various niche art that is usually not part of a main exhibition or gala special. The Luce Foundation Center features paintings densely hung on screens; sculptures; crafts and objects by folk and self-taught artists arranged on shelves. Large-scale sculptures are installed on the first floor. The center has John Gellatly&#x27;s European collection of decorative arts.

====Lunder Conservation Center====
 The Lunder Conservation Center, which opened in July 2006, is the first art conservation facility that allows the public permanent behind-the-scenes views of preservation work. Conservation staff are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques which conservators use to examine, treat, and preserve artworks. The Lunder Center has five conservation laboratories and studios equipped to treat paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, sculptures, folk art objects, contemporary crafts, decorative arts, and frames. The Center uses various specialized and esoteric tools, such as hygrothermographs, to maintain optimal temperature and humidity to preserve works of art. Staff from both the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery work in the Lunder Center.

===Selected exhibitions===

===Outreach===
The museum has maintained a traveling exhibition program since 1951. During the 2000s renovation, a &quot;series of exhibitions of more than 1,000 major artworks from American Art&#x27;s permanent collection traveled to 105 venues across the United States,&quot; which were &quot;seen by more than 2.5 million visitors&quot;. Since 2006, thirteen exhibitions have toured to more than 30 cities.

SAAM provides electronic resources to schools and the public as part of education programs. An example is &quot;Artful Connections&quot;, which gives real-time video conference tours of American Art. In addition, the museum offers the Summer Institutes: Teaching the Humanities through Art, week-long professional development workshops that introduce educators to methods for incorporating American art and technology into their humanities curricula.

American Art has seven online research databases, which has more than 500,000 records of artworks in public and private collections worldwide, including the Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture. Numerous researchers and millions of virtual visitors per year use these databases. Also, American Art and Heritage Preservation work together in a joint project, Save Outdoor Sculpture, &quot;dedicated to the documentation and preservation of outdoor sculpture&quot;. The museum produces a peer-reviewed periodical, &quot;American Art&quot; (started in 1987), for new scholarship. Since 1993, American Art has been had an online presence. It has one of the earliest museum websites when, in 1995, it launched its own website. EyeLevel, the first blog at the Smithsonian Institution, was started in 2005 and, as of 2013, the blog &quot;has approximately 12,000 readers each month&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In 2006, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi designed the conservators&#x27; denim work aprons.

In 2008, the American Art Museum hosted an alternate reality game, called &quot;Ghosts of a Chance&quot;, which was created by City Mystery. The game allowed patrons &quot;a new way of engaging with the collection&quot; in the Luce Foundation Center. The game ran for six weeks and attracted more than 6,000 participants.

<text>James (Jim) Charles Bennett (born 1948) is an American businessman, with a background in technology companies and consultancy, and a writer on technology and international affairs from a conservative point of view.

During the 1980s he was involved in space-launch ventures, being a founder of Starstruck Inc. and of American Rocket Company (AMROC) in 1985; technology of these companies found its way into SpaceShipOne. In the 1990s he was a technology consultant. He is president and chairman of Internet Transactions Transnational, Inc., a 1997 Internet start-up, and vice chairman of Openworld, Inc., a nonprofit group promoting sustainable self-help initiatives. 
, he is a proponent of fundamental reform of the U.S. government space program, both in its civilian and military manifestations.

His publications and quotes like &quot;democracy, immigration, multiculturalism… pick any two&quot;, popularising the idea of Anglospheric exceptionalism in a similar vein as Mark Steyn, have been called misleading by some libertarian writers. He was a columnist for United Press International 2000-3, with a weekly piece &quot;The Anglosphere Beat&quot;; he has propagated the idea of the Anglosphere as significant, , in world affairs and alignments. His book-length study &quot;The Anglosphere Challenge: Why the English-Speaking Nations Will Lead the Way in the Twenty-First Century&quot; was published in 2004. He is co-founder and current President of the Anglosphere Institute of Alexandria, Virginia.

He is also an Adjunct Senior Fellow of the Hudson Institute, and a contributor to its publications. In addition, Mr. Bennett serves as an Expert at Wikistrat.

Jim Bennett is one of the directors of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing (IMM), affiliated with the Foresight Institute.

<text>Modern antique (an apparent oxymoron) can have various meanings. Since customs laws and dealers often stipulate an age of at least a hundred years for any item to be legitimately called an &quot;antique&quot;, the term is sometimes used to describe a collector&#x27;s item that is technologically obsolete; for example, an older computer or retro toy.

This term is also used to describe new objects designed to appear much older than they are, as with reproductions of old devices and furniture with a distressed (lightly damaged or artificially worn) finish.

More rarely, &quot;modern antique&quot; may refer to an item from the modern era which is also old enough to qualify for the simple description &quot;antique&quot;.

<text>MC-Hár (&quot;Hár&quot; means &quot;Hair&quot; in Faroese) is a rap-band from the Faroe Islands. They were the first Faroese rap-band and the first band to sing rap in Faroese. Since the first time MC-Hár went on stage in February 1991, the band has made its mark on the Faroese rock scene. From being an underground act with a small but faithful following, the band in the late nineties emerged as one of the biggest acts in the Faroe Islands.

== History ==
MC-Hár was established in February 1991 in Torshavn by rappers Niels Uni Dam and Allan Mortensen. They were quite active and part of the vibrant music scene in the Faroe Islands in the early 90s. They played a radio concert in January 1992, which is the first actual recording of the band. They also played Tungmálmur 92 and Tungmálmur 93, the first two heavy metal concerts held in the Faroe Islands. MC-Hár also featured on the annual Ólavsøkukonsert in 1992. After a couple of years as an emerging act in Tórshavn, the members moved to Copenhagen at the time in order to study. They rehearsed in the basement of the &quot;Øresundskollegiet&quot;, a student residence where many young Faroese students live while studying in Copenhagen. They played at concerts especially in summertime in Tórshavn and other places in the Faroe Islands when they were home on holidays, i.e. at the Ólavsøka Concert which was popular then, before the musical festivals started. They released their first album: &quot;Framvegis uttan vit&quot; in 1998, and the maxi CD &quot;Burn me&quot; the following year. Apart from these albums the band has released songs on several compilations and live albums.

The band is still active from time to another, i.e. they played on Ólavsøka in 2006, 2009 2012 and in 2013, where they were called &quot;the legendary MC-Hár&quot;, on Norðoyastevna in Klaksvík in 2011, headlining the first ever G! Festival. They played at the Spot Festival in Aarhus in 1999 being one of the first Faroese bands to play there. In 2013 the band once again ventured abroad playing a gig in the legendary Loppen in Christiania 

The band was founded by rappers Spark Buzz N (a.k.a. Niels Uni Dam) and MC-Allah (a.k.a. Allan Mortensen). Over the years they have been the frontmen of the band, while the line-ups have changed. MC-Allah left the band in 2003 just a week before the band were scheduled to play in the final of the big bi-annual Faroese band contest Prix Føroyar. The reason for leaving the band he founded was, that he didn&#x27;t feel like it anymore.

Niels Uni Dam remains in the band, and singer Rókur Jákupsson Jakobsen, who joined the band in 2000, has taken a more central role, replacing MC-Allah as co-frontman with Niels Uni Dam. Rókur Jakobsen was voted &quot;Best Faroese Male Singer 2006&quot; at the Planet Awards ceremony in January 2007 and Faroese singer songwriter of the year in 2005. He has a successful solo career, as well as in bands like Diatribes, Lokum, Tangz, All That Rain and currently also the vocal group Bollarnir.

Even though some changes have been in the line-up, some band members have stayed on over long periods, and have become integral parts of the band. Bassplayer Heri Reynheim first joined the band in 1996 and is still a member of the band. His solid rock bass is a major part of the MC-Hár sound. While playing in MC-Hár Heri has also played in other Faroese bands such as Life, Malan Eyðunsdóttir Band, Deja Vu and Fluffy Toys. Heri has released one album with the 70&#x27;s rock band Eager To Please, where he was joined by current MC-Hár drummer Rani Hammershaimb Christiansen and Fate singer Dagfinn Joensen. Both Heri and Rani are also members of viking hard rock band Hamradun, one of the most popular bands to hail from the Faroe Islands with three albumbs and extensive touring record behind them.
Rani joined MC-Hár in the summer of 2002, only weeks before the band were booked to headline the first ever G!Festival. He teamed up with former Diatribes bandmates Heri Reynheim, Rókur Jakobsen and guitar player Jens Virgar Jakobsen. The guitar player joined MC-Hár in 2000, replacing Niels Arge Galán, who left MC-Hár to focus on his punk project 200.

Jens Virgar Jakobsen is still a member of the band, but is also known for his contributions in the Bluegrass and country act &quot;The Reverends&quot; and Danish rock act Mr. Conroy. Jónas Bloch Danielsen plays rhythm guitar. He joined the band in 1998, after being a stand-in engineer on the band&#x27;s first studio album &quot;Framvegis Uttan Vit&quot;. He Engineered, produced and mixed the follow-up EP Burn Me in 1999, and was for years Studio Owner at Studio Bloch in Tórshavn, after working with Faroese singer/songwriter Teitur for quite some years.

Tróndur Bogason plays keyboards and sings. He has been the main songwriter in the band, since he joined them in late 1991. Twice he has had breaks from the band, but rejoined in 2003. Bogason has studied music at the Royal Danish Academy of Music. In the period 1999-2005 he took The Masters programme in composition and in 2005-2007 he studied The Soloist programme in composition. Bogason has co-worked with the well known Faroese singer Eivør Pálsdóttir, and in 2012 they got married.

Niels Uni Dam had a weekly review of Faroese music in the national Faroese Radio (Kringvarp Føroya) in broadcasts called Kvørnin and Brunsj.

<doc id="1182972" wikidata="Q294615" url="?curid=1182972" title="AMA Superbike Championship">
<text>AMA Superbike Championship is an American motorcycle racing series that has been run every year beginning in 1976. For most of its existence it has been considered the premier motorcycle road racing series in the United States. It is sanctioned by the AMA American Motorcyclist Association since its inception, and the promotion of the series has been licensed to several organizations over the years. Since 2015 the series has been run and promoted by MotoAmerica, who also manage several other AMA professional road racing championships, including the popular 600cc Supersport class.

The AMA Superbike Championship was created in 1976 as a new motorcycle road racing series taking advantage of the newest large displacement production road-going motorcycles of up to 1000cc&#x27;s that were increasingly popular with American riders. The series was initially called &quot;Superbike Production&quot; and was initially modeled on a regional series that had been run in California in the previous years. Up until this the most prestigious racing series in the United States was the AMA Grand National Series which required competition in five different formats 1/4 mile, 1/2 mile, 1 mile and TT courses, which were all run on dirt ovals, and pavement racing. Europe, under the guidance of the FIM, or Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme, had a much more developed motorcycle road racing world championship, but it didn&#x27;t include any American venues in the series.

In 1986, the AMA recognized the changing nature of motorcycle racing by making the Grand National Championship into a dirt-track-only series; road-racing rounds were branched off into a separate championship which was named the AMA Superbike Championship. The fact that the rules were set up to compete using the same large displacement production bikes that people saw in the showrooms quickly made the series popular with fans, racers and after several seasons motorcycle manufacturers took a direct interest and began sponsoring teams and riders.

== History ==
=== 1976 to 1982: The 1000cc era ===
At the inception of the series there was stiff competition between the more experienced teams racing European twin cylinder bikes, which included the BMW R90S, Ducati and MotoGuzzi motorcycles and the teams racing the more powerful Japanese inline fours from Kawasaki, Suzuki, Honda and Yamaha. While the Japanese bikes produced more horsepower, the European bikes tended to have superior handling. The inaugural series in 1976 was won by rider Reg Pridmore on a BMW R90S owned by Team Butler and Smith. European machines won every race in 1976 and the first half of the 1977 series, but after two seasons of work the Team Racecrafters Kawasaki KZ 1000, again piloted by Reg Pridmore, won the first race for the Japanese. With the advent later that year of the better handling Suzuki GS 1000, the less powerful twin-cylinder European bike&#x27;s race domination was over.

As the series gained more and more attention in America the factories took note, and in 1980 Honda entered the series with a factory team and brought a top rider from their stable, Freddie Spencer, to compete on their behalf. Up until this point Honda and the other Japanese manufacturers were more focused on the International Grand Prix and in particular its premier 500cc Series, which was run on purpose built 500cc racing motorcycles. By 1980 the 500cc class was completely dominated by two-stroke machines, which at the same time had been phased out for road use in many countries. The American Superbike Series was suddenly more relevant and appealing to manufacturers.

=== 1983 to 2002: The 750cc rule and the age of the Homologation Specials ===
The speeds that the 1000cc four cylinder bikes producing up to 150 horsepower were able to achieve were overwhelming the stock frames, suspension and tires of the era. Thus for 1983 the AMA, working with the top teams, decided to reduce the maximum capacity of the Superbike class to 750cc.

Honda, which had been competing in the series on their CB 750F was ready with a new bike in 1983, initially planned as a &quot;homologation special&quot; that is, a bike which is built in just enough numbers to satisfy the production rule. (Typically 5,000 units sold worldwide).
That bike, the Honda Interceptor VF750F was a huge departure from the air-cooled, four valve per cylinder CB-750F launched in 1979. It featured a square tube steel perimeter frame which wrapped around the outside of the engine, rather than the older hidden round-tube frames. It was a water cooled V4 with four valves per-cylinder. Originally Honda had planned only to make enough to meet the requirement for production racing, but the bike was extremely popular, even at the price which was higher than the older CB-750, and it went into full production. Honda was unsuccessful in winning the championship with the new bike in 1983, as Wayne Rainey riding on Team Muzzy Kawasaki GPz 750 won the inaugural 750cc Superbike championship, but Honda went on to win the next five years in a row of series championships with the Interceptor.

As the popularity of the series grew the long established Daytona 200 motorcycle race, which had begun on a course constructed on the beach in 1935, and had moved to the asphalt auto-racing track in 1961, switched to Superbikes. The race had been one of the few venues where FIM style Formula 1 500cc machines raced in the United States, but by 1988 the speeds the machines were reaching on the high-banked tracks were simply too high for safety given the tire technology of the time. In 1985 the race format moved from GP bikes to Superbikes, and it became part of the AMA Superbikes series. This increased the visibility of Superbikes even further, and cemented in the minds of many Americans that the Superbikes were now the de facto premier motorcycle racers, eclipsing the FIM 500cc series, with their unavailable two-stroke racing machines.

===2003 to 2008: Return of the liter class===
In late 2002 AMA Pro Racing, the promoter in charge of the AMA Superbike Championship at the time decided to open up the series to 1000cc production bikes. Their plan called for allowing near-stock 1000cc machines to compete against the then-current state of the art 750cc Superbikes that were the incumbent series competition machines. In addition, they would be allowed to increase their capacity to 800cc. The complicated rules allowed &quot;claiming&quot; of the 1000cc stock machines, a technique where competitors can buy the winning machine from the owner for a set amount of money, and intended to keep modifications down in near-stock racing classes. Ultimately this complicated mix of machines and rules was not liked by many of the competitors. In 2006 Ducati withdrew factory support from AMA Superbike racing, and in 2008 Honda followed suit.

===2009 to 2014: Daytona Motorsports Group===

From 2009 to 2014, the Daytona Motorsports Group was the organizer under supervision of the AMA. The AMA, not pleased with motorcycle counts and participation in their events, stripped the DMG organization of the sanction and awarded it to a new organization led by Wayne Rainey, KRAVE, with assistance from Dorna (which organises the FIM MotoGP and World Superbike Championships).

===2015 to Present: MotoAmerica takes charge, FIM alignment===
KRAVE organized multiple championship road racing series for the AMA, which are collectively known as the MotoAmerica Road Racing Series beginning in 2015.

MotoAmerica chose to align the multiple racing classes closely with those used by FIM, which simplifies the work that manufacturers must do to compete in both series.

* Superbike (matches FIM regulations)
* Stock 1000 (FIM Superstock 1000)
* Supersport (FIM Supersport, 600cc to 750cc)
* Twins (800cc, two cylinder)
* Junior Cup (FIM Supersport 300, 300cc to 500cc)

The most successful riders included Doug Chandler, Scott Russell, Ben Spies, Miguel Duhamel and Mat Mladin, who holds several series records including seven championships. Five non-Americans won the title – Englishman Reg Pridmore, Australians Mat Mladin and Troy Corser, Canadian Miguel Duhamel, and Spaniard Toni Elías.

Television rights are held by MotoAmerica, but can currently be seen on FOX Sports 1 &amp; 2, MAVTV Network, MotoAmerica&#x27;s Facebook page, MotoAmerica&#x27;s Youtube Channel, and MotoAmerica&#x27;s LIVE+ App.

<doc id="1182975" wikidata="Q5310185" url="?curid=1182975" title="Dual basis in a field extension">
<text>In mathematics, the linear algebra concept of dual basis can be applied in the context of a finite extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;, by using the field trace. This requires the property that the field trace &quot;Tr&quot;&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; provides a non-degenerate quadratic form over &quot;K&quot;. This can be guaranteed if the extension is separable; it is automatically true if &quot;K&quot; is a perfect field, and hence in the cases where &quot;K&quot; is finite, or of characteristic zero.

A dual basis () is not a concrete basis like the polynomial basis or the normal basis; rather it provides a way of using a second basis for computations.

Consider two bases for elements in a finite field, GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot;):

:formula_1

and

:formula_2

then &quot;B&quot;2 can be considered a dual basis of &quot;B&quot;1 provided

:formula_3

Here the trace of a value in GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot;) can be calculated as follows:

:formula_4

Using a dual basis can provide a way to easily communicate between devices that use different bases, rather than having to explicitly convert between bases using the change of bases formula. Furthermore, if a dual basis is implemented then conversion from an element in the original basis to the dual basis can be accomplished with multiplication by the multiplicative identity (usually 1).

<doc id="1182977" wikidata="Q142206" url="?curid=1182977" title="Chandler, Quebec">
<text>Chandler () is a town in the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region of Quebec, Canada. It is the second-most populous town on the Gaspé Peninsula after the Town of Gaspé. It was known as Pabos between June 27, 2001 and May 4, 2002.

The city is the birthplace of NHL player Mathieu Garon, Quebec politician Joseph-Léonard Duguay, singer &quot;La Bolduc&quot; (Mary Rose Anna Travers), singer and actor Flora Gionest-Roussy and world curling champion John Kawaja.

In addition to Chandler itself, the town&#x27;s territory also includes the communities of Newport, Grand-Pabos-Ouest, Pabos, Pabos Mills, and Saint-François-de-Pabos. Chandler&#x27;s major industries include fishing and tourism.

==History==
The area was first settled in 1729, making it one of the oldest places on the Gaspé coast. It was known over time as Paboc, Pabo, Pabok, Pabeau, and Pas-bos. In 1815, the final spelling of Pabos was assigned in the &quot;Description topographique de la province du Bas Canada&quot; (Topographical Description of the Province of Lower Canada). The meaning of this name is uncertain, although there are various theories: from the Mi&#x27;kmaq word &quot;papôg&quot; (meaning &quot;playful waters&quot;); a Basque name; from the Spanish &quot;pavo&quot;; a place in France, home of the first seignoral lord; or from the French words &quot;pas[sage] beau&quot; (meaning &quot;beautiful passage&quot;).

In 1758, the settlement was destroyed by General James Wolfe during his Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign. It was rebuilt and by 1860, the Parish of Sainte-Adélaïde-de-Pabos was formed. In 1876, it had become the most important civil and religious town in the Gaspésie region, and the place was incorporated as the Municipality of Pabos. 3 years later, its post office opened.

In 1912, Percy Milton Chandler, a Philadelphian manufacturer, built the first pulp and paper mill in the Gaspésie at the mouth of the Grand Pabos River, originally known as Portage-du-Grand-Pabos. By 1916, this village separated from Pabos and was incorporated as the Village Municipality of Chandler. The name Grand-Pabos was also used and in the 1930s, it was even tried to officially rename the village to Grand-Pabos. In 1958, Chandler gained &quot;ville&quot; (city) status.

On June 27, 2001, the municipalities of Newport, Pabos, Pabos Mills, and Saint-François-de-Pabos, as well as the City of Chandler, were merged to form the new City of Pabos, renamed to Chandler on May 4, 2002.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Chandler had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="1182980" wikidata="Q6925465" url="?curid=1182980" title="Mountain formation">
<text>Mountain formation occurs due to a variety of geological processes associated with large-scale movements of the Earth&#x27;s crust (tectonic plates). Folding, faulting, volcanic activity, igneous intrusion and metamorphism can all be parts of the orogenic process of mountain building. The formation of mountains is not necessarily related to the geological structures found on it.

From the late 18th century until its replacement by plate tectonics in the 1960s, geosyncline theory was used to explain much mountain-building. The understanding of specific landscape features in terms of the underlying tectonic processes is called &quot;tectonic geomorphology&quot;, and the study of geologically young or ongoing processes is called &quot;neotectonics&quot;.

==Types of mountains==

There are five main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, plateau, fault-block, and dome. A more detailed classification useful on a local scale predates plate tectonics and adds to these categories.

===Volcanic mountains===

Movements of tectonic plates create volcanoes along the plate boundaries, which erupt and form mountains. A &quot;volcanic arc system&quot; is a series of volcanoes that form near a subduction zone where the crust of a sinking oceanic plate melts and drags water down with the subducting crust.

Most volcanoes occur in a band encircling the Pacific Ocean (the Pacific Ring of Fire), and in another that extends from the Mediterranean across Asia to join the Pacific band in the Indonesian Archipelago. The most important types of volcanic mountain are &quot;composite cones&quot; or &quot;stratovolcanoes&quot; and &quot;shield volcanoes&quot;.

A shield volcano has a gently sloping cone because of the low viscosity of the emitted material, primarily basalt. Mauna Loa is the classic example, with a slope of 4°-6°. (The relation between slope and viscosity falls under the topic of angle of repose.) A composite volcano or stratovolcano has a more steeply rising cone (33°-40°), because of the higher viscosity of the emitted material, and eruptions are more violent and less frequent than for shield volcanoes. Examples include Vesuvius, Kilimanjaro, Mount Fuji, Mount Shasta, Mount Hood and Mount Rainier.

===Fold mountains===
When plates collide or undergo subduction (that is, ride one over another), the plates tend to buckle and fold, forming mountains. While volcanic arcs form at oceanic-continental plate boundaries, folding occurs at continental-continental plate boundaries. Most of the major continental mountain ranges are associated with thrusting and folding or orogenesis. Examples are the Balkan Mountains, the Jura and the Zagros mountains.

===Block mountains===
When a fault block is raised or tilted, a block mountain can result. Higher blocks are called &quot;horsts,&quot; and troughs are called &quot;grabens&quot;. A spreading apart of the surface causes tensional forces. When the tensional forces are strong enough to cause a plate to split apart, it does so such that a center block drops down relative to its flanking blocks.

An example is the Sierra Nevada range, where delamination created a block 650 km long and 80 km wide that consists of many individual portions tipped gently west, with east facing slips rising abruptly to produce the highest mountain front in the continental United States.

Another example is the Rila–Rhodope massif in Bulgaria, including the well defined horsts of Belasitsa (linear horst), Rila mountain (vaulted domed shaped horst) and Pirin mountain—a horst forming a massive anticline situated between the complex graben valleys of the Struma and Mesta rivers.

===Uplifted passive margins===
Unlike orogenic mountains there is no widely accepted geophysical model that explains elevated passive continental margins such as the Scandinavian Mountains, eastern Greenland, the Brazilian Highlands, or Australia&#x27;s Great Dividing Range.
Different elevated passive continental margins most likely share the same mechanism of uplift. This mechanism is possibly related to far-field stresses in Earth&#x27;s lithosphere. According to this view elevated passive margins can be likened to giant anticlinal lithospheric folds, where folding is caused by horizontal compression acting on a thin to thick crust transition zone (as are all passive margins).

==Models==
===Hotspot volcanoes===
Hotspots are supplied by a magma source in the Earth&#x27;s mantle called a mantle plume. Although originally attributed to a melting of subducted oceanic crust, recent evidence belies this connection. The mechanism for plume formation remains a research topic.

===Fault blocks===
Several movements of the Earth&#x27;s crust that lead to mountains are associated with faults. These movements actually are amenable to analysis that can predict, for example, the height of a raised block and the width of an intervening rift between blocks using the rheology of the layers and the forces of isostasy. Early bent plate models predicting fractures and fault movements have evolved into today&#x27;s kinematic and flexural models.

<doc id="1182982" wikidata="Q2297777" url="?curid=1182982" title="Dual basis">
<text>In linear algebra, given a vector space formula_1 with a basis formula_2 of vectors indexed by an index set formula_3 (the cardinality of formula_3 is the dimension of formula_1), the dual set of formula_2 is a set formula_7 of vectors in the dual space formula_8 with the same index set formula_3 such that formula_2 and formula_7 form a biorthogonal system. The dual set is always linearly independent but does not necessarily span formula_8. If it does span formula_8, then formula_7 is called the dual basis or reciprocal basis for the basis formula_2.

Denoting the indexed vector sets as formula_16 and formula_17, being biorthogonal means that the elements pair to have an inner product equal to 1 if the indexes are equal, and equal to 0 otherwise. Symbolically, evaluating a dual vector in formula_8 on a vector in the original space formula_1:
:formula_20
where formula_21 is the Kronecker delta symbol.

==Introduction==
To perform operations with a vector, we must have a straightforward method of calculating its components. In a Cartesian frame the necessary operation is the dot product of the vector and the base vector. For example,

: formula_22

where formula_23 is the basis in a Cartesian frame. The components of formula_24 can be found by

: formula_25

However, in a non-Cartesian frame, we do not necessarily have formula_26 for all formula_27. However, it is always possible to find vectors formula_28 in the dual space such that

: formula_29

The equality holds when the formula_28s are the dual basis of formula_31s. Notice the difference in position of the index formula_32.

==Existence and uniqueness==
The dual set always exists and gives an injection from &quot;V&quot; into &quot;V&quot;∗, namely the mapping that sends &quot;vi&quot; to &quot;vi&quot;. This says, in particular, that the dual space has dimension greater or equal to that of &quot;V&quot;.

However, the dual set of an infinite-dimensional &quot;V&quot; does not span its dual space &quot;V&quot;∗. For example, consider the map &quot;w&quot; in &quot;V&quot;∗ from &quot;V&quot; into the underlying scalars &quot;F&quot; given by for all &quot;i&quot;. This map is clearly nonzero on all &quot;vi&quot;. If &quot;w&quot; were a finite linear combination of the dual basis vectors &quot;vi&quot;, say formula_33 for a finite subset &quot;K&quot; of &quot;I&quot;, then for any &quot;j&quot; not in &quot;K&quot;, formula_34, contradicting the definition of &quot;w&quot;. So, this &quot;w&quot; does not lie in the span of the dual set.

The dual of an infinite-dimensional space has greater dimension (this being a greater infinite cardinality) than the original space has, and thus these cannot have a basis with the same indexing set. However, a dual set of vectors exists, which defines a subspace of the dual isomorphic to the original space. Further, for topological vector spaces, a continuous dual space can be defined, in which case a dual basis may exist.

===Finite-dimensional vector spaces===

In the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces, the dual set is always a dual basis and it is unique. These bases are denoted by formula_35 and formula_36. If one denotes the evaluation of a covector on a vector as a pairing, the biorthogonality condition becomes:
:formula_37

The association of a dual basis with a basis gives a map from the space of bases of &quot;V&quot; to the space of bases of &quot;V&quot;∗, and this is also an isomorphism. For topological fields such as the real numbers, the space of duals is a topological space, and this gives a homeomorphism between the Stiefel manifolds of bases of these spaces.

==A categorical and algebraic construction of the dual space==

Another way to introduce the dual space of a vector space (module) is by introducing it in a categorical sense. To do this, let formula_38 be a module defined over the ring formula_39 (that is, formula_38 is an object in the category formula_41). Then we define the dual space of formula_38, denoted formula_43, to be formula_44, the module formed of all formula_39-linear module homomorphisms from formula_38 into formula_39. Note then that we may define a dual to the dual, referred to as the double dual of formula_38, written as formula_49, and defined as formula_50.

To formally construct a basis for the dual space, we shall now restrict our view to the case where formula_51 is a finite-dimensional free (left) formula_39-module, where formula_39 is a ring with unity. Then, we assume that the set formula_54 is a basis for formula_51. From here, we define the Kronecker Delta function formula_56 over the basis formula_54 by formula_58 if formula_59 and formula_60 if formula_61. Then the set formula_62 describes a linearly independent set with each formula_63. Since formula_51 is finite-dimensional, the basis formula_54 is of finite cardinality. Then, the set formula_66 is a basis to formula_67 and formula_67 is a free (right) formula_39-module.

==Examples==
For example, the standard basis vectors of formula_70 (the Cartesian plane) are
:formula_71

and the standard basis vectors of its dual space formula_72 are
:formula_73

In 3-dimensional Euclidean space, for a given basis formula_74, the biorthogonal (dual) basis formula_75 can be found by formulas below:

:formula_76
where denotes the transpose and

:formula_77

is the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the basis vectors formula_78 and formula_79

In general the dual basis of a basis in a finite-dimensional vector space can be readily computed as follows: given the basis formula_80 and corresponding dual basis formula_81 we can build matrices
:formula_82

Then the defining property of the dual basis states that
:formula_83

Hence the matrix for the dual basis formula_84 can be computed as
:formula_85

<doc id="1182983" wikidata="Q991035" url="?curid=1182983" title="Eruption (British band)">
<text>Eruption were a British disco, R&amp;B and soul recording act in the 1970s and 1980s. They are best known for their covers of Ann Peebles&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot; and Neil Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;One Way Ticket&quot;, which were big disco hits in 1978 and 1979.

==History==
The band was formed in 1969 as a school band in the United Kingdom as Silent Eruption, and consisted of musicians of Caribbean origins. The group changed the name to Eruption in 1974. Precious Wilson joined the band in 1974 as a backing singer and a year later in 1975, they won the RCA Soul Search contest and their first single &quot;Let Me Take You Back in Time&quot; was released. The group didn&#x27;t find a singer who could replace Lindel Leslie so backing singer Precious Wilson became the lead singer. Their manager signed a contract for several concerts in Germany. In 1977 they went on the road in Germany where they were discovered by Hans-Jörg Mayer who worked as a talent scout for Frank Farian (the producer of Boney M.) Farian signed the group with the Germany-based Hansa Records and the band was the backing band and the support act for Boney M&#x27;s first European tour.

Their &#x27;comeback&#x27; single &quot;Party, Party&quot; did well in 1977, but their cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot; released in December 1977 was an international hit, reaching No. 1 in Belgium and Australia, No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 18 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Afterwards, in the spring of 1978, &quot;Party, party&quot; was re-released and became a hit in the Benelux countries. Both songs were included in their first album, released in December 1977. It was followed by their second album titled &quot;Leave a Light&quot;, launched towards the end of 1978. The first single off the album, &quot;Leave a Light&quot;, went largely unnoticed, but the second single, &quot;One Way Ticket&quot; (a cover of Neil Sedaka&#x27;s song written by Jack Keller and Hank Hunter), catapulted them to the top of the charts (a UK No. 9 hit).

In 1979, Eruption and Boney M. were both featured in the 1979 German film &quot;Disco Fever&quot;. Precious Wilson left the group in the same year to pursue a solo career and was replaced by singer Kim Davis. The group enjoyed their third German top 10 hit with &quot;Go Johnnie Go&quot; from the third album &quot;Fight Fight Fight&quot;. Shortly after, a tragedy hit when Davis succumbed to a brain haemorrhage, although some sources claim she died in a car accident. The band decided to continue and singer Jane Jochen stepped in. A new recording, a cover of Del Shannon&#x27;s &quot;Runaway&quot; was released in December 1980, and peaked at No. 21 in the German charts. After a compilation album in the spring of 1981 and the single release of &quot;You (You Are My Soul)&quot; from &quot;Fight Fight Fight&quot;, the band signed to Ralph Siegel&#x27;s Jupiter Records.

By now, without the lead vocals of Precious Wilson, success was drastically diminishing, and the singles from their fourth album &quot;Our Way&quot; received little notice. In 1983, the drummer Eric Kingsley left Eruption, and Andi Weekes Barbados joined the group to play drums during last two years of the band&#x27;s activity. In 1985, Eruption disbanded. In 1988, a new version of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot; was released. In 1994, Farian released the CD &quot;Gold – 20 Super Hits&quot; which featured five remixed and two original Eruption titles and 13 tracks from Precious Wilson&#x27;s solo album. The new version of &quot;One Way Ticket&quot; was released as a single in the same year to promote the compilation. In 1997, Wilson became the legal owner of the trademark Eruption. She continues to tour promoting her solo projects, and also as Eruption with her new group, but none of the band&#x27;s original members perform in the latest line-ups.

<doc id="1182986" wikidata="Q3643599" url="?curid=1182986" title="Bran Stark">
<text>Brandon Stark, also known as Bran, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, where he is portrayed by English actor Isaac Hempstead Wright. Introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Bran subsequently appears in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998) and &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000). He is one of a few prominent characters that are not included in the fourth novel &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005), but returned in the fifth novel &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011).

Bran is the second son and fourth child of Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn Stark of Winterfell, the ancient capital of the North of the kingdom of Westeros. Bran dreams of becoming a knight since childhood, but is rendered paraplegic by Jaime Lannister in the first novel after stumbling upon the latter&#x27;s affair with twin sister Cersei Lannister. Awaking from a months-long coma, he is subsequently plagued by dreams of a mysterious figure beckoning him to travel north beyond the Wall. Bran&#x27;s journey alongside a variety of companions lead him deeper into the lore and magic of the North, where he begins to discover various mysterious powers and abilities.

Martin told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2014 that Bran&#x27;s momentous chapter with Jaime and Cersei is what &quot;hooked&quot; many readers early in the first novel. Bran&#x27;s characterization in later seasons of the show, including his relationship to the White Walkers and the Night King, has generated many theories in the fandom, as well as significant critical interest.

== Character overview ==
The youngest point of view character in the novels, Bran is in the very first chapter and was set up by Martin as a young hero of the series. Mikal Gilmore of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted in 2014 that the moment in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; in which Jaime Lannister pushes Bran to his likely death &quot;grabs you by the throat&quot;. Martin commented in the interview:

In 2000, Martin called Bran the hardest character to write:

&quot;Booklist&quot; cited Bran as a notable character in 1999, and the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; review of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; noted, &quot;It is fascinating to watch Martin&#x27;s characters mature and grow, particularly Stark&#x27;s children, who stand at the center of the book.&quot;

Noting Bran&#x27;s absence in 2005&#x27;s &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; wrote in his review of &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011):
===Description===

Bran is seven years old at the beginning of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996). He is the fourth child and second son of Lord Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark of Winterfell, Hand of the King, and his wife Lady Catelyn, and has five siblings: an older brother Robb, two older sisters Sansa and Arya, a younger brother Rickon, and an older illegitimate half-brother Jon Snow. Bran is constantly accompanied by his direwolf Summer, the intellectually disabled stableboy Hodor (who carries him around after his crippling), and the Reed siblings Meera and Jojen.

Martin describes Bran as favoring his mother in appearance, having the thick auburn hair and deep blue eyes of the Tullys. According to Martin, Bran is strong willed, but a sweet and thoughtful boy, well-loved by everyone at Winterfell. Before his fall he enjoyed climbing and exploring the walls and ramparts of the castle. He grew up wanting to be a knight for the Kingsguard, but those dreams were quickly brought to an end when Bran had to face the fact that he will never walk again. He is also dutiful and tough-minded.

With his dreams of being a knight dashed by the crippling attempt on his life in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, duty forces Bran to overcome his new limitations and embrace his new abilities. Although he doesn&#x27;t realize his newfound powers at first, he grows to discover what he can accomplish. His gradual acceptance of his seemingly-prophetic visions (called the &quot;greensight&quot;) and his ability to psychically inhabit his direwolf Summer (which marks him as a type of skinchanger known as a warg) show his growing maturity and his worth beyond the loss of his legs. He also manages to enter Hodor&#x27;s mind, and later skinchanges into crows and even weirwood trees under the mentorship of the Three-Eyed Crow.

== Storylines ==
=== &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; ===
In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Bran accidentally sees Queen Cersei Lannister and her twin brother Ser Jaime having sex; whereupon he is pushed from the window by Jaime to keep the incest a secret, but he survives in a coma. Although it is speculated by some characters that Jaime and Cersei pushed Bran, there were no public accusations made against the crown. While Bran remains unconscious, a fire is set at an opposite tower as a distraction while an attempt is made on his life. Catelyn, who has remained with Bran while Robb takes care of the fire, is able to delay the assassin long enough for Bran&#x27;s direwolf, Summer, to kill him. Senseless, Bran dreams of his falling from the tower and of a three-eyed crow that offers to teach him to fly. With the crow&#x27;s guidance, Bran wakes; but having been crippled by the fall, he is unable to walk. Thereafter he relies on the giant simpleton Hodor to move around, and a harness designed by Tyrion Lannister to ride a horse. When Robb rides south to relieve Ned&#x27;s arrest in King&#x27;s Landing, Bran becomes the acting Lord of Winterfell.

=== &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; ===
1998&#x27;s &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; finds Robb named King in the North, and Bran, as Robb&#x27;s heir, rules Winterfell in his brother&#x27;s absence. When Theon Greyjoy betrays the Starks and captures Winterfell, Bran and Rickon escape, aided by the wildling Osha. To hide his failure, Theon has two other children murdered and proclaims them to be Bran and Rickon. Having been hiding in the crypts of Winterfell, Bran and his companions emerge to find the castle in ruins. They come upon a mortally wounded Maester Luwin, who advises their traveling party to split. Osha takes Rickon in the direction of White Harbor, while Bran, Hodor, Meera, and Jojen Reed set off north to seek the three-eyed crow. Meanwhile, Bran has slowly accepted the veracity of his dreams, and his ability to psychically inhabit Summer, which makes him a type of skin-changer known as a warg.

=== &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; ===
Bran, Hodor, Meera and Jojen travel north to the Wall in search of the three-eyed crow in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000).

=== &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; ===
In &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011), Bran, Hodor, Meera and Jojen are joined by the mysterious Coldhands, and a Child of the Forest named Leaf takes them to the three-eyed crow (actually a human telepath), who in turn offers to train Bran in retrocognition and clairvoyance.

=== Family tree of House Stark ===
== TV adaptation ==
Bran Stark is played by Isaac Hempstead Wright in the television adaption of the series of books. Like the other children, Bran is aged up for television. He begins the series a 10-year-old child (3 years older than his book counterpart), and is 17 by the end of the series.

===Storylines===
Brandon &quot;Bran&quot; Stark is the second son and fourth child of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. He was named after his deceased uncle, Brandon.

====Season 1====
Bran receives one of a litter of recovered direwolves given to the Stark children and names him Summer. During the King&#x27;s visit to Winterfell, Bran accidentally interrupts the Queen, Cersei, having sex with her brother, Jaime, who shoves him from the window. While he is unconscious and recovering from his injuries, Summer kills an assassin sent to murder Bran. When he awakens Bran cannot recall the events before his fall and finds that he is crippled from the waist down, forced to be carried everywhere by the stableboy Hodor. Slowly, he realizes that he has gained the ability to assume Summer&#x27;s consciousness, making him a warg or a skinchanger. After his older brother, Robb, is crowned King in the North, Bran becomes Robb&#x27;s heir and the Lord of Winterfell.

====Season 2====
After Theon Greyjoy captures Winterfell, Osha helps Bran and his younger brother Rickon go into hiding. To cement his claim on Winterfell, Theon has two orphan boys killed and their bodies burned, and passes their charred corpses off as Bran and Rickon. After Theon&#x27;s men betray him and Winterfell is sacked, Bran, Rickon, Hodor, Osha and their direwolves head north to find his older brother Jon Snow for safety.

====Season 3====
Bran and his group encounter Jojen and Meera Reed, two siblings who aid them in their quest. Jojen shares Bran&#x27;s &quot;greensight&quot; and tutors him in his prophetic visions. After coming close to the Wall, Osha departs with Rickon for Last Hearth (to keep him safe) while Bran insists on following his visions beyond the Wall. Bran and his group encounter Sam and Gilly, who try to persuade Bran not to venture beyond the Wall, but Bran claims it is his destiny and leaves through the gate with Hodor and the Reeds.

====Season 4====
During their travels beyond the Wall, Bran and his group stumble across Craster&#x27;s Keep, where they are captured and held by Night&#x27;s Watch mutineers, led by Karl Tanner. Night&#x27;s Watchmen led by Jon eventually converge on Craster&#x27;s Keep, but Locke, an agent of Roose Bolton, pretending to be a new Watch recruit, finds Bran first and takes him hostage. Bran wargs into Hodor and snaps Locke&#x27;s neck. The group then continues on without telling Jon, who Jojen claims would stop them. Bran eventually reaches the Heart Tree but is set upon by wights outside the entrance. Jojen is killed in the attack, but the Children of the Forest lead Bran and his company safely into a magic cave, to meet the Three-Eyed Raven. The Three-Eyed Raven declares that Bran will not walk again but will fly, instead.

====Season 6====
As part of his training, Bran is shown several visions of the past, including Ned Stark and Howland Reed confronting Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower at the Tower of Joy, and sees how the Children of the Forest injected one of the First Men with dragonglass in a ritual to create the Night King, the first White Walker, as a defense against the other First Men. However, the Three-Eyed Raven is always quick to withdraw Bran from the visions, warning that he may become trapped in them if he stays too long. Growing bored with his slow progress, Bran enters a vision on his own and witnesses the Night King in the present day, who sees Bran and marks him, making the Three-Eyed Raven&#x27;s cave vulnerable to the White Walkers&#x27; magic.

The Three-Eyed Raven enters Bran into another vision of Winterfell&#x27;s past to impart all his knowledge, but before the transfer is completed the White Walkers attack the cave, killing the Three-Eyed Raven, Summer, and the Children of the Forest. Bran, still caught in the vision, wargs into Hodor through the latter&#x27;s younger self (named Wylis), and he and Meera flee as Hodor carries Bran&#x27;s unconscious body out of the cave. Meera carries Bran into the forest, while Hodor gives his life to hold back the cave door against the army of wights until they overwhelm him. Bran witnesses how his accidentally linked Hodor&#x27;s past and present mind, inducing a brain damaging seizure in young Wylis and causing him to repeat Meera&#x27;s command to &quot;hold the door&quot; over and over, until he can only slur the word &quot;Hodor&quot;.

After the wight army catches up to them again, Bran and Meera are rescued by Bran&#x27;s uncle Benjen Stark, who had been killed by the White Walkers several years prior but was revived by the Children. Benjen whisks the duo to safety and advises that Bran is now the Three-Eyed Raven and must learn to control his powers before the Night King attacks the Seven Kingdoms. Benjen leaves Bran and Meera at the weirwood in the Haunted Forest, as the Wall&#x27;s magic prevents the dead (and therefore, Benjen) from passing it. Bran touches the weirwood and witnesses the rest of the vision of Ned Stark at the Tower of Joy. He discovers that Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Rhaegar Targaryen&#x27;s son Aegon, whom Ned found and raised as Jon Snow at Lyanna&#x27;s dying request.

====Season 7====
Bran returns to Winterfell, which has been rebuilt and reoccupied by the remaining Starks. Jon Snow has traveled to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys Targaryen, after which he is finally reunited at Winterfell with Sansa and Arya, who are both concerned by Bran&#x27;s knowledge about their tribulations following Ned&#x27;s execution. Littlefinger gives Bran a Valyrian steel dagger (the one used by Bran&#x27;s would-be assassin in season one), which Bran passes to Arya. Meera leaves Winterfell to return to Greywater Watch; Bran&#x27;s indifference to her departure makes her realize that Bran &quot;died&quot; in the Three-Eyed Raven&#x27;s cave. For that reason, Bran remains aloof from his siblings as well. He uses his greenseeing abilities to discover Littlefinger&#x27;s betrayal of Ned. When Sansa confronts Littlefinger about his treason towards House Stark, Bran corroborates the accusations leveled against him, and Arya executes Littlefinger at Sansa&#x27;s command.

Samwell Tarly arrives in Winterfell and comes to visit Bran. Bran tells Sam his discovery that Jon is the bastard son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, but Sam mentions a former High Septon&#x27;s record of annulling Rhaegar&#x27;s marriage to Elia Martell so that he could marry Lyanna. Bran uses greenseeing to confirm that the marriage took place, and then revisits the vision of the Tower of Joy, discovering that Jon&#x27;s real name is Aegon Targaryen. Bran declares that Jon is therefore the heir to the Iron Throne.

====Season 8====
Bran is reunited with Jon when he returns to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen and her forces. Bran reveals to them that the Night King has reanimated Daenerys&#x27; dragon Viserion and used it to breach the Wall. Bran urges Sam to tell Jon the truth of his parentage, upon which Jon abdicates his claim in favour of Daenerys&#x27;. Jaime later arrives at Winterfell to aid in the fight against the dead, but Bran does not reveal Jaime&#x27;s role in crippling him.

At the war council before the battle against the dead, Bran explains that the Night King desires to create an endless winter and will try to kill him during the battle, due to his ability to hold humanity&#x27;s collective memories. He convinces the council to let him wait in the Godswood as bait for the Night King. Theon, who has returned to Winterfell to fight the dead with his men, offers to defend Bran, and Jon and Daenerys plan to hide in wait to attack the Night King when he emerges. The Night King eventually breaches the castle and approaches Bran, killing Theon in the process. He is about to kill Bran, but Arya intervenes and manages to stab the Night King with the Valyrian steel dagger, eliminating the Night King as well as all the other White Walkers and undead he resurrected.

Westeros is left without a ruler when, after Daenerys successfully wrests King&#x27;s Landing from Cersei Lannister, she proceeds to burn the surrendered populace of the city, during which Cersei is also killed. Jon fails to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. He is arrested. Weeks later, Tyrion Lannister proposes choosing Bran as the new king before a council of the lords and ladies of Westeros. He reasons that it would make a good story to unite the people, suggesting that future kings be elected by the lords of Westeros rather than inheriting the crown. When Tyrion asks Bran if he is willing to be king, Bran replies, &quot;Why do you think I came all this way?&quot; The council holds a vote and all agree except for Sansa, who instead requests the North&#x27;s independence. Bran agrees, being stylized as Bran the Broken, King of the Six Kingdoms. He appoints Tyrion as his Hand of the King. Later, Brienne, Bronn, Davos, and Sam form Bran&#x27;s Small Council. It is revealed Bran has decided to exile Jon to the Night&#x27;s Watch for killing Daenerys as a compromise. As Jon leaves, he apologizes to Bran for not being there for him, but Bran responds, &quot;You were exactly where you were supposed to be.&quot; Bran tasks himself with finding Drogon.

<text>Murrurundi ( ) is a rural town located in the Upper Hunter Shire, in the Upper Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia.

Murrurundi is situated northwest by road from Newcastle and north from Sydney. At the the town had a population of 847 people. The town is almost completely surrounded by mountains of the Liverpool Range, and is located on the Pages River, a tributary of the Hunter River.

==History and overview ==
Prior to European settlement, the Murrurundi district was home to the Wanaruah and possibly the Kamilaroi Aboriginal people. 
The name &quot;Murrurundi&quot; is often erroneously thought to come from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;nestling in the valley&quot;. It does in fact mean &quot;five fingers&quot;, a representation of the rock formation visible at the northern end of the township.

European settlement of the area began in the 1820s, and the town itself was established by the New South Wales government in 1840. In the same year, a local landholder, Thomas Haydon, established an adjacent private township called Haydonton. In the 1846 census, Murrurundi had a population of 52, while Haydonton had a total of 117. In 1913, the two neighbouring settlements were merged to create the modern-day town of Murrurundi.

Benjamin Hall, father of bushranger Ben Hall had a small farm in a valley near Murrurundi in 1839. He opened a butcher&#x27;s shop at Haydonton in 1842. Ben Hall lived at Murrurundi with his family until the age of 13.

Oil shale (kerosene shale) was mined at Mount Temi, some to the north of Murrurundi from 1886, but lay dormant for many years. The mine was revived in 1910, by British Australian Oil Company, and a railway was constructed from Temple Court, west of Murrurundi, to the terminal of an aerial ropeway bringing shale from the mine. Operations ceased during the First World War.

In July 1910, a lion, two lionesses and two Russian wolves escapeed from Wirth&#x27;s Circus.

Murrurundi is the nearest major town to the site of the Murulla rail accident, which occurred on 13 September 1926. 27 people were killed when runaway wagons smashed into a mail train.

Annual events include the rodeo and the King of the Ranges stockman challenge. There are only a few sporting facilities due to the low population. These sports are senior rugby league, touch football, swimming club and cricket.

Murrurundi was the main town of the former Murrurundi Shire local government area, which was abolished and its territory divided between two new, larger, shires. The town of Murrurundi is now part of Upper Hunter Shire.

In January 2019, Murrurundi ran out of water making it necessary for trucks to begin daily delivery of potable water.

In October 2019 it was announced that the Wilson Memorial Community Hospital would be demolished to make away for a new hospital.

== Heritage listings ==
Murrurundi has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Northern railway: Murrurundi railway station
* Mount Street: Rosedale Cottage

==Transport==
The New England Highway runs through the town, and it is served by a rail service.

Murrurundi railway station is located on the Main North railway line, from Sydney. The station opened in 1872 and consists of a substantial brick station-house with a passing loop and goods yard. There was also a locomotive depot for bank engines which lasted until the end of steam. It continues to be served by a daily rail service operated by a NSW TrainLink Xplorer train to and from Sydney and Armidale/Moree, trains will only stop at this station on request.

==Climate==

The area has two weather stations: one in the town, and another high up on the Murrurundi Gap about to the WNW. The latter has significantly cooler maximum temperatures (even when accounting for elevation) but also warmer minima, by virtue of being an exposed hilltop.

The town station commenced rainfall records in 1870; temperature averages and extremes from 1907 and 1965, respectively; whereas the gap station was not established until 2003.

<doc id="1182993" wikidata="Q1126045" url="?curid=1182993" title="Pomeron">
<text>In physics, the pomeron is a Regge trajectory — a family of particles with increasing spin — postulated in 1961 to explain the slowly rising cross section of hadronic collisions at high energies. It is named after Isaak Pomeranchuk.

==Overview==
While other trajectories lead to falling cross sections, the pomeron can lead to logarithmically rising cross sections — which, experimentally, are approximately constant ones. The identification of the pomeron and the prediction of its properties was a major success of the Regge theory of strong interaction phenomenology. In later years, a BFKL pomeron was derived in further kinematic regimes from perturbative calculations in QCD, but its relationship to the pomeron seen in soft high energy scattering is still not fully understood.

One consequence of the pomeron hypothesis is that the cross sections of proton–proton and proton–antiproton scattering should be equal at high enough energies. This was demonstrated by the Soviet physicist Isaak Pomeranchuk by analytic continuation assuming only that the cross sections do not fall. The pomeron itself was introduced by Vladimir Gribov, and it incorporated this theorem into Regge theory. Geoffrey Chew and Steven Frautschi introduced the pomeron in the West. The modern interpretation of Pomeranchuk&#x27;s theorem is that the pomeron has no conserved charges—the particles on this trajectory have the quantum numbers of the vacuum.

The pomeron was well accepted in the 1960s despite the fact that the measured cross sections of proton–proton and proton–antiproton scattering at the energies then available were unequal.

The pomeron carries no charges. The absence of electric charge implies that pomeron exchange does not lead to the usual shower of Cherenkov radiation, while the absence of color charge implies that such events do not radiate pions.

This is in accord with experimental observation. In high energy proton–proton and proton–antiproton collisions in which it is believed that pomerons have been exchanged, a rapidity gap is often observed: This is a large angular region in which no outgoing particles are detected.

==Odderon==

The odderon, the counterpart of the pomeron that carries odd charge parity, was introduced in 1973 by Leszek Łukaszuk and Basarab Nicolescu. Odderons exist in QCD as a compound state of three reggeized gluons. Potentially theorized in 2015. It was potentially observed only in 2017 by the TOTEM experiment at the LHC. This observation was later confirmed in a joint analysis with the DØ experiment at the Tevatron and appeared in the media as the particle&#x27;s discovery in March 2021.

==String theory==
In early particle physics, the &#x27;pomeron sector&#x27; was what is now called the &#x27;closed string sector&#x27; while what was called the &#x27;reggeon sector&#x27; is now the &#x27;open string theory&#x27;.

<text>Mont Albert North is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 13 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whitehorse local government area. Mont Albert North recorded a population of 5,609 at the 2021 census.

The northern border of the suburb is the Eastern Freeway and the southern border is Kenmare Street, while Elgar Road constitutes the boundary in the east. The western boundary is a series of back streets running close to Union Road. This boundary follows the municipal boundary with the City of Boroondara.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 Mont Albert North reported a median house price of A$1.15 million for a three bedroom house.

==History==

The area was originally called Mont Albert North. It was then renamed Box Hill North, then subsequently renamed back to Mont Albert North.

Mont Albert North Post Office opened on 1 July 1957 and closed in 1993.

==Milk bar==
One of the famous sites in Mont Albert North has been the milk bar, located on the corner of Access Road and Arcade Road. For many years this has been the meeting place of many young adults within the area and it continues to be an iconic part of Mont Albert North. In mid-2008 the popular soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; was filmed at the milk bar. In early 2021, the milk bar was sold and re-constructed into a café called &quot;Matilda&quot;.

==Education==
* Koonung Secondary College on Elgar and Cairo Roads, established in 1966
* Box Hill Senior Secondary College (formerly Box Hill Technical School)
* Box Hill University of the Third Age, found just north of Box Hill Senior on Strabane Avenue

<text>Borgund is a former municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It was located in the southeastern part of the traditional district of Sogn. The municipality existed from 1864 until its dissolution in 1964. It encompassed an area in the eastern part of the present-day Lærdal Municipality. The administrative center of Borgund was the village of Steinklepp, just northeast of the village of Borgund. Steinklepp was the site of a store, a bank, and a school. The historical Filefjell Kongevegen road passes through the Borgund area.

==Location==

The former municipality of Borgund was situated near the southeastern end of the Sognefjorden, along the Lærdalselvi river. The lower parts of the municipality were farms such as Sjurhaugen and Nedrehegg. They were at an elevation of about above sea level. Høgeloft, on the border with the neighboring municipality of Hemsedal, is a mountain in the Filefjell range and it was the highest point in Borgund at above sea level. The lakes Eldrevatnet, Juklevatnet, and Øljusjøen were also located near the border with Hemsedal.

==History==
Borgund was established as a municipality in 1864 when it was separated from the municipality of Lærdal. Initially it had a population of 963. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Borgund (population: 492) was merged with the Muggeteigen area (population: 11) of the neighboring Årdal Municipality and all of Lærdal Municipality (population: 1,755) were all merged to form a new, larger municipality of Lærdal.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Borgund&quot; farm ( or ) since the historic Borgund Stave Church was built there. The first element is which means &quot;castle&quot; or &quot;fortified place&quot;. The last element is the suffix which means &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;having a lot of something&quot;.

==Government==
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

===Municipal council===
The municipal council of Borgund was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:

<doc id="1183009" wikidata="Q1780878" url="?curid=1183009" title="Western theater of the American Revolutionary War">
<text>The western theater of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783) was the area of conflict west of the Appalachian Mountains, the region which became the Northwest Territory of the United States as well as what would become the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, and Tennessee. The western war was fought between American Indians with their British allies in Detroit, and American settlers south and east of the Ohio River, and also the Spanish as allies of the latter.

==Background==
At the conclusion of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), Great Britain won uncontested influence over the region between its Atlantic Coast colonies and the Mississippi River. The Ohio River marked a tenuous border between the American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. The Proclamation of 1763 forbade British colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains in order to prevent conflict between Indians and colonists in the vast territory newly acquired from France. Settlers and land speculators in Britain and America objected to this restriction, however, and so British officials negotiated two treaties with American Indians in 1768—the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the Treaty of Hard Labour—which opened up land for settlement south of the Ohio River. Thereafter, tensions between British officials and colonists over western land policy diminished.

As the Revolution approached, tensions grew in the Ohio Valley. The Grand Ohio Company was built on speculation in Native American lands, and Great Britain granted tracts of Native land to veterans of the French and Indian War to pay off debts. But in 1772, Great Britain redeployed many of its western forces to the East Coast due to the increasing tensions with the colonists, removing a deterrent to illegal squatters. In 1774, Great Britain determined that these land grants could not be granted to colonial veterans, meaning that colonial veterans who had invested heavily in land speculation (such as George Washington) would lose their investment. That same year, the Quebec Act placed the lands between the Ohio River and Great Lakes under the jurisdiction of Quebec. That Spring, a group of settlers led by Daniel Greathouse committed the Yellow Creek massacre, in which thirteen women and children were killed, including the wife and pregnant sister of Tachnechdorus, who had been friendly to settlers until that time. In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled. As expected, Tachnechdorus took revenge, and was supported by the Shawnee, who expressed discontent that they had still not been paid for their lands. Still other Shawnee fled the Scioto River valley, avoiding the anticipated war with the white settlers who suddenly surrounded them.

Most of the Indians who actually lived and hunted in the Ohio Valley—Shawnees, Mingos, Lenape, and Wyandots—had not been consulted in the 1768 treaties. Angry with the Iroquois for selling their lands to the British, Shawnees began to organize a confederacy of western Indians with the intention of preventing the loss of their lands. British and Iroquois officials worked to diplomatically isolate the Shawnees from other Indian nations, however, and so when Dunmore&#x27;s War broke out in 1774, Shawnees faced the Virginia militia with few allies. After Virginia&#x27;s victory in the war, the Shawnees were compelled to accept the Ohio River boundary. Shawnee and Mingo leaders who did not agree with these terms renewed the struggle soon after the American Revolutionary War began in 1775.

==1775 to 1776 - Neutrality and small raids==
Initially, both the British and the Continental Congress sought to keep western American Indians out of the war. At Fort Pitt in October 1775, American and Indian leaders reaffirmed the boundary established by Dunmore&#x27;s War the previous year. Without British support, Indian leaders such as Chief Blackfish (Shawnee) and Pluggy (Mingo) raided into Kentucky, hoping to drive the settlers out. Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia wanted to retaliate by attacking Pluggy&#x27;s Town in the Ohio Country, but he canceled the expedition for fear that the militia would be unable to distinguish between neutral and hostile Indians, and thus make enemies of the neutral Lenape and Shawnees. Nevertheless, Shawnees and Lenape became increasingly divided over whether or not to take part in the war. While leaders such as White Eyes (Lenape) and Cornstalk (Shawnee) urged neutrality, Buckongahelas (Lenape) and Blue Jacket (Shawnee) decided to fight against the Americans.

In Kentucky, isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, compelling many to return to the East. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan&#x27;s Station. In December 1776, Pluggy was killed in an attack on McClellan&#x27;s Station, which was located on the site of present Georgetown, Kentucky.

==1776 - Opening battle of the war==
The Battle of Island Flats, at Eaton&#x27;s station, was the opening battle of the American War of Independence in the west. The battle was fought in July 1776—shortly after the United States had declared its independence from Britain. It pitted the American Patriot militia and a small force of regulars, against the British-allied Cherokee warriors, who launched a three-pronged attack against the frontier inhabitants in the Overmountain region of the Washington District. On July 20, 1776, they started their campaign against the settlers at the lowlands across from Long Island on the Holston. The frontiersmen had been warned ahead of time by messengers sent from the Cherokee diplomat, Nancy Ward.

Following Cherokee chiefs Dragging Canoe (&quot;Tsiyu Gansini&quot;), The Raven (&quot;Savanukah&quot;), and Oconostota (all three of whom were experienced warriors), but lacking the element of surprise, the Cherokees were quickly routed, took several casualties, and had to withdraw. Red Chief Dragging Canoe, who led the attack on Eaton&#x27;s station, was badly wounded, but survived. The other two battles were fought later in the day: Oconostota at Watauga, and The Raven at Carter&#x27;s valley. The Raven had some success in driving out the inhabitants of Carter&#x27;s Valley, as fleeting as it was; but Oconostota&#x27;s force was also routed.

==1777 - Escalation==
In 1777, the British launched the Saratoga campaign from Canada. In order to provide a strategic diversion for operations in the Northeast, officials in Detroit began recruiting and arming Indian war parties to raid American settlements. Unknown numbers of American settlers in present Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania were killed in these raids. The intensity of the conflict increased after enraged American militiamen murdered Cornstalk, the leading advocate of Shawnee neutrality, in November. Despite the violence, many Ohio Indians still hoped to stay out of the war. This was a difficult task because they were located directly between the British in Detroit and the Americans along the Ohio River.

==1778 to 1779 - American advances==
In the early years of the war, the Virginians had attempted to defend their western border with militiamen garrisoning three forts along the Ohio River—Fort Pitt, Fort Henry, and Fort Randolph. Defending such a long border proved to be futile, however, because American Indians simply bypassed the forts during their raids. In 1778, the Americans decided that offensive operations were necessary to secure their western border.

In September 1778, the United States negotiated the Treaty of Fort Pitt and secured Lenape support for an attack on Detroit the following month. The campaign was abandoned after the death of Lenape leader White Eyes.

===Problems at Fort Pitt===
The first American expedition into the Ohio Country was a debacle. In February 1778, General Edward Hand led 500 Pennsylvania militiamen from Fort Pitt on a surprise winter march towards Mingo towns on the Cuyahoga River, where the British stored military supplies which they distributed to Indian raiding parties. Adverse weather conditions prevented the expedition from reaching its objective, however. On the return march, some of Hand&#x27;s men attacked neutral Lenape Indians, killing one man and a few women and children, including relatives of the Lenape chief Captain Pipe. Because only non-combatants had been killed, the expedition became derisively known as the &quot;squaw campaign&quot;.

Besides unruly militia, Loyalist sentiment around Pittsburgh also contributed to Hand&#x27;s problems. In March, three men with close ties to the British and American Indians left Pittsburgh, defecting to the British and Indian side. They were Simon Girty, an interpreter who had guided the &quot;squaw campaign&quot;, Matthew Elliot, a local trader, and Alexander McKee, an agent for the British Indian Department. All three would prove to be valuable British operatives in the war. Amid much criticism, and facing a congressional investigation for allowing the men to defect, Hand resigned in May.

===Treaty making and fort building===
Following the escalation of the war in 1777, Americans on the western frontier appealed to the Continental Congress for protection. After an investigation, a Congressional commission recommended in early 1778 that two regiments of the Continental Army be stationed in the West. Furthermore, because a defensive line of forts had little effect on Indian raids into the American settlements, the commissioners called for a fort to be built on the Indian side of the Ohio River, the first in a line of forts which would enable the Americans, it was hoped, to mount an expedition against Detroit.

Hollidays Cove Fort was a Revolutionary War fortification constructed in 1774 by soldiers from Ft. Pitt. It was located in what is now downtown Weirton, West Virginia, along Harmons Creek (named for Harmon Greathouse), about three miles from its mouth on the Ohio River. It was commanded by Colonel Andrew Van Swearingen (1741–1793) and later by his son-in-law, Captain Samuel Brady (1756–1795), the famous leader of Brady&#x27;s Rangers. In 1779, over 28 militia were garrisoned at Hollidays Cove. Two years earlier in 1777, Colonel Van Swearingen led a dozen soldiers by longboat down the Ohio to help rescue the inhabitants of Fort Henry in Wheeling in a siege by the British and Indian tribes. That mission was memorialized in a WPA-era mural painted on the wall of the Cove Post Office by Charles Shepard Chapman (1879–1962). The mural features Col. John Bilderback, who later gained infamy as the leader of the massacre of the pacifist Indians in Gnadenhutten in 1782.

In order to build a fort in the Ohio Country, the Americans sought the approval of the Lenape Indians. In September 1778, Americans negotiated the Treaty of Fort Pitt with the Lenape, which resulted in the building of Fort Laurens along the Tuscarawas River. American plans soon went awry, however. White Eyes, the Lenape leader who had negotiated the treaty, was apparently murdered in 1778 by American militiamen. His rival, Captain Pipe, eventually abandoned the American alliance and moved west to the Sandusky River, where he began receiving support from the British in Detroit. Furthermore, because of intense warfare in eastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, Congress was unable to provide the manpower for operations against Detroit. Fort Laurens was abandoned in 1779.

===Clark&#x27;s Illinois campaign===

In late 1778, George Rogers Clark, a young Virginia militia officer, launched a campaign to seize the sparsely garrisoned Illinois Country from the British. With a company of volunteers, Clark captured Kaskaskia, the chief post in the Illinois Country, on July 4, and later secured the submission of Vincennes. Vincennes was recaptured by General Henry Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit. In February 1779, Clark marched to Vincennes in a surprise winter march and captured Hamilton himself.

To American frontiersmen, Hamilton was known as &quot;the Hair-buyer General&quot; because, they believed, he encouraged Indians to kill and scalp American civilians. For this reason, Governor Thomas Jefferson brought Hamilton to Williamsburg, Virginia, to be tried as a war criminal. After British officials threatened to retaliate against American prisoners of war, Jefferson relented, and Hamilton was exchanged for an American prisoner in 1781.

Although Clark&#x27;s forces captured and held outposts in the lower areas of the territory, British forces maintained control of Fort Lernoult (Detroit).

==1780 – Major British and Indian offensive==

Over the next several years of the war, both sides launched raids against each other, usually targeting settlements. In Spring of 1780, British and Native American forces swept across the Midwest to clear the territories of rebels and Spanish forces, attacking St. Louis and Cahokia and Kentucky, but were repulsed in both battles. In St. Louis, the British and Indian force was repulsed by the mixed Spanish and French creole force. Fort San Carlos, a stone tower in modern downtown St Louis, was the center of this defense. Hundreds of Kentucky settlers were killed or captured in Bird&#x27;s expedition, however, and within months, General George Rogers Clark retaliated by crossing the Ohio River and attacking Shawnee towns along the Mad River, Chillicothe and Piqua.

In the Illinois territory, French officer Augustin de La Balme assembled a militia force of French residents in an effort to take Fort Detroit. The force was destroyed in November by the Miami under Chief Little Turtle. At the same time, the nearly abandoned Fort St. Joseph was raided by Americans from Cahokia. On their return trip, however, they were overtaken by British loyalists and Indians near Petit fort.

==1781==
Spanish Governor Francisco Cruzat, in St. Louis, sent a force of about 140 Spanish soldiers and American Indians under Captain Eugenio Pourré to capture Fort St. Joseph. It was captured and plundered on February 12, 1781.
In late 1780, Clark traveled east to consult with Thomas Jefferson, the governor of Virginia, about an expedition in 1781. Jefferson devised a plan which called for Clark to lead 2,000 men against Detroit. Recruiting enough men was a problem, however. In time of war, most militiamen preferred to stay close to their homes rather than go on extended campaigns. Furthermore, Colonel Daniel Brodhead refused to detach the men because he was staging his own expedition against the Lenape, who had recently entered the war against the Americans. Brodhead marched into the Ohio Country and destroyed the Lenape Indian capital of Coshocton in April, but this only made the Lenape more determined enemies and deprived Clark of badly needed men and supplies for the Detroit campaign. Most of the Lenape fled to the militant towns on the Sandusky River.

When Clark finally left Fort Pitt in August, he was accompanied by only 400 men. On August 24, a detachment of one hundred of his men was ambushed near the Ohio River by Indians led by Joseph Brant (&quot;also&quot; Thayendanegea), a Mohawk leader temporarily in the west. Brant&#x27;s victory ended Clark&#x27;s efforts to move against Detroit. But that same year, British and Native American forces attacked Fort Laurens, a U.S. fort in the Ohio Territory.

Between the combatants on the Sandusky River and the Americans at Fort Pitt were several villages of pacifist Christian Lenape. The villages were administered by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although non-combatants, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept American officials at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In response, in September 1781, Wyandots and Lenape from Sandusky forcibly removed the Christian Lenape and the missionaries to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.

==1782 – &quot;The Year of Blood&quot;==
In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode into the Ohio Country, hoping to find the Indian warriors who were responsible for ongoing raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by the gruesome murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson&#x27;s men detained about 100 Lenape now known as the &quot;Christian Munsee&quot; at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Munsee had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops that they had been forced to leave behind. Accusing the Christian Munsee of having aided Indian raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians killed the 100 Christian Indians— mostly women and children— with hammer blows to the head.

Colonel William Crawford of the Continental Army came out of retirement to lead 480 volunteer militiamen, mostly from Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, with the intention of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had learned about the expedition in advance, however, and brought about 440 men to the Sandusky to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.

During the retreat, Colonel Crawford and an unknown number of his men were captured. The Indians executed many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhütten massacre earlier in the year, in which about 100 Indian civilians were murdered by Pennsylvania militiamen. Crawford&#x27;s execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before being burned at the stake.

The failure of the Crawford expedition caused alarm along the American frontier, as many Americans feared that the Indians would be emboldened by their victory and launch a new series of raids. Even more defeats for the Americans were yet to come, and so for Americans west of the Appalachian Mountains, 1782 became known as the &quot;Bloody Year&quot;. On July 13, 1782, the Mingo leader Guyasuta led about 100 Indians and several British volunteers into Pennsylvania, destroying Hannastown and killing nine and capturing twelve settlers. It was the hardest blow dealt by Indians in Western Pennsylvania during the war.

In Kentucky, the Americans went on the defensive while Caldwell, Elliott, and McKee with their Indian allies prepared a major offensive. Fort Estill was attacked by Wyandot Indians in March 1782. Colonel Benjamin Logan, commanding officer of the region, and stationed at Logan&#x27;s Station, learned that the Wyandot warriors were in the area on warpath. The Indians, aided by the British in Detroit, had raided from Boonsborough past Estill&#x27;s Station along the Kentucky River. Logan dispatched 15 men to Captain Estill at Estill&#x27;s Station with orders to increase his force by 25 more men and reconnoiter the country to the north and east. Following orders, Captain Estill reached the Kentucky River a few miles below the mouth of Station Camp Creek and camped that night at Sweet Lick, now known as Estill Springs. On the day after they left Estill&#x27;s Station, a body of Indians appeared there at dawn on March 20, they raided the fort, scalped and killed a Miss Innes in sight of the fortification and took Monk, a slave of Captain Estill, and killed all the cattle. As soon as the Indians retreated, Samuel South and Peter Hackett, both young men, were dispatched to take the trail of the men and inform them of the news. The boys found them near the mouth of Drowning Creek and Red River early on the morning of March 21. Of the 40 men, approximately 20 had left families within the fort. They returned with the boys to Estill&#x27;s Station. The remainder crossed the Kentucky river and found the Indian trail. Captain Estill organized a company of 25 men, followed the Indians, and suffered what is known as Estill&#x27;s Defeat, later known as the Battle of Little Mountain (March 22, 1782) in Montgomery Co.

In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition was called off after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. The reports turned out to be false, but Caldwell still managed to lead 300 Indians into Kentucky and deliver a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. One of the last battles of the Revolutionary War was the September 1782 Siege of Fort Henry. With peace negotiations between the United States and Great Britain making progress, Caldwell was ordered to cease further operations. Similarly, General Irvine had gotten permission for a Continental Army expedition into the Ohio Country, but this was cancelled. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final blow in the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.

==Peace and legacy==
The war in the Northwest, in the words of historian David Curtis Scaggs, Jr. &quot;ended in a stalemate&quot;. In the war&#x27;s final years, each side could destroy enemy settlements, but could not stay and hold the territory. For the Shawnees, the war was a loss: the Americans had successfully defended Kentucky and increased settlement there, so that prime hunting ground was now lost. Although the Indians had been pushed back from the Ohio River and were now settled primarily in the Lake Erie basin, the Americans could not occupy the abandoned lands for fear of Indian raids.

News of the pending peace treaty arrived late in 1782. In the final treaty, Canada lost portions of its southwest territory as a result of the Ohio Country and areas south of the Great Lakes being signed away by Great Britain to the United States, even though &quot;not a single American soldier was north of the Ohio River when the treaty was signed&quot;. Great Britain had not consulted the Indians in the peace process, and the Indians were nowhere mentioned in treaty&#x27;s terms. The western theater had a markedly different tone than the European style battles in the east, which left a generational impact on US settlers and Native Nations. For the Native Nations resisting the encroachment of their lands, the struggle would soon continue as the Northwest Indian War, though this time without the explicit support of the British.

<text>Deja Entendu (French for &quot;already heard&quot;) is the second studio album by American rock band Brand New, released on June 17, 2003, by Triple Crown Records and Razor &amp; Tie. It was widely praised for showing the band&#x27;s maturation from their pop punk debut &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot;, and critics described the album as the moment when the band &quot;started showing ambition to look beyond the emo/post-hardcore scene that birthed them.&quot;

The album, considered the band&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough&quot;, was Brand New&#x27;s first to chart in the United States (at number 63), and its two singles &quot;The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows&quot; and &quot;Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades&quot; both reached the top 40 in the United Kingdom Singles Chart and earned MTV airplay. It was certified Gold nearly four years after its release. Its commercial success led to Brand New signing with DreamWorks/Interscope Records shortly after.

The album received very positive reviews and has since been placed on numerous lists as one of the greatest albums of the decade and from the emo genre.

==Background==
Brand New&#x27;s second studio album was written in &quot;the year-and-a-half or two years&quot; that they were touring the material from &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot;. According to drummer Brian Lane, &quot;Jesse [Lacey] wrote a lot of the lyrics about different things than &#x27;I just broke up with my girlfriend&#x27; for the new record.&quot; Lacey wrote the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom.

&quot;I&#x27;m surprised that so many bands just keep putting out the same record as they did previously. We try to flex as much of our diversity muscles… as we can,&quot; Lacey said about the band&#x27;s development.

The album was produced by Steven Haigler.

=== Album title ===
&quot;Deja Entendu&quot; literally translates to &quot;already heard&quot; in French. Frontman Jesse Lacey told &quot;MTV&quot; that the title was a &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; commentary about the band&#x27;s music, stating: &quot;No matter who you are or what your band is about, you can&#x27;t put a record out without people saying it&#x27;s derivative of something else. So by saying the record&#x27;s already been heard, it&#x27;s kind of like saying, &#x27;Yeah, you&#x27;re right. We&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s already been done before.&#x27; We&#x27;re not trying to break new ground in music. We&#x27;re just trying to make good music.&quot; He also said that bands like Sigur Rós and Outkast were uniquely &quot;groundbreaking&quot; as &quot;there is new territory to be charted, but I don&#x27;t necessarily think that we&#x27;re the ones to be doing it.&quot;

=== Cover artwork ===
The cover art for &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; was designed by musicians Don and Ryan Clark of the band Demon Hunter, who ran the graphic design studio Invisible Creature. The band contacted the studio in early 2003 with just the album&#x27;s title as a reference point, contacting the studio only once before receiving the final product. Don Clark said in 2015 that, &quot;If I could go back, there are a zillion little things I would do differently. I was much younger (and greener) at the time, so some of the light and shadow work is a bit clunky.&quot; However, both Clark and &quot;DIY&quot; agreed that the cover became an &quot;iconic image&quot; for an album that &quot;from a musical standpoint, was way ahead of its time.&quot;

== Lyrics and meaning ==
Several of the song titles reference films. The first track entitled &quot;Tautou&quot; references the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, in the movie &quot;Amélie&quot;. &quot;Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don&#x27;t&quot; is a line from &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, and &quot;Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades&quot; is a quote from Wes Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;Rushmore&quot;. In addition, the line &quot;And I&#x27;ve seen what happens to the wicked and proud when they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown&quot; (from &quot;Jaws Theme Swimming&quot;) is a reference to a line from the 1999 film &quot;Dogma&quot;, specifically referencing a line of Matt Damon&#x27;s character Loki. &quot;I Will Play My Game Beneath the Spin Light&quot; is a quote from the Bruce Brooks sports novel &quot;The Moves Make the Man&quot;, and borrows lines from the song &quot;Chumming the Ocean&quot; by the band Archers of Loaf.

&quot;Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis&quot; is a song that Lacey describes as being about his worst nightmare, turning into a washed-up figure after his prime has ended. The title draws a comparison to Elvis Presley, who died from a drug overdose, and Diego Maradona, who suffered from drug addiction and was accused of domestic violence.

&quot;Guernica&quot;, whose title references the Picasso painting of the same name, was written about Lacey&#x27;s grandfather and his struggle with cancer. Lacey felt guilty about how the band&#x27;s recording commitments meant that he could not return home to be by his side. &quot;It was a horrible circumstance and I felt very selfish and very bad about the whole thing,&quot; he told &quot;Rock Sound&quot;.

&quot;Good to Know That If I Ever Need Attention All I Have to Do Is Die&quot; criticizes the music industry and &quot;when managers, labels, agents and lawyers get their claws on the prize money&quot;. The title came from something that a friend of Lacey said after false rumors of his death created concern among people he had not spoken to in years. &quot;As the band grows, everyone wants to take a piece of us,&quot; he said.

The song &quot;Play Crack the Sky&quot; was about the 1951 shipwreck of the FV Pelican at Montauk Point, New York where 45 people died within a mile of the lighthouse. Lacey claimed the song &quot;touches on parts of life that I don&#x27;t talk about a lot [...] I have grown up around water being from living on Long Island. Surfing, sailing, fishing, that&#x27;s a huge part of my life apart from the band.&quot; The ending of the song is a reference to the run-out groove on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). During a show on his 2007 solo tour with Kevin Devine, Jesse explained that the title was a reference to Mylon LeFevre song &quot;Crack the Sky&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Deja Entendu&quot; was released through Triple Crown and Razor &amp; Tie on June 17, 2003. &quot;The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single to rock radio on October 6. It peaked at No. 39 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 37 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs in the US. The album was released in the UK on October 13, through Eat Sleep. On November 3, the album was released in Australia through Below Par. &quot;Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades&quot; was released to radio on November 18 as the album&#x27;s second single. It reached No. 37 in the UK. The first pressing for the album in 2003 was 1,000 records.

On March 2, 2015, the band announced a reissue of the album. It was first released for Record Store Day on April 18 in limited packaging before a wider release on May 5. Both were pressed on 180-gram black vinyl.

== Commercial performance ==
After seven weeks since its release, the album matched &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot;″s sales of 51,000 copies. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 29, 2007, nearly four years after its original release. It is Brand New&#x27;s only album to date that has been certified.

Brand New, who would soon sign with DreamWorks Records (which became incorporated into Interscope Records), were recognized as part of a trend that saw bands labeled as &quot;emo&quot; getting signed to major record label deals in an attempt to sign the next big thing. &quot;Spin&quot; dubbed this trend &quot;mainstreamo&quot;, but Lacey rebuked the hype, believing that &quot;I think it’s all gonna fall through in a year and a half, maybe sooner. This is becoming like ’80s hair metal all over again. All you can really do is try hard to be one of the bands that does manage to stick.” The program director for influential Washington, D.C. rock radio station WHFS noted that &quot;we haven’t reached the point where Puddle of Mudd fans are calling up requesting Brand New.”

Following the album&#x27;s success, Triple Crown Records knew that they had no chance of re-signing Brand New following the conclusion of their two-album deal. Lyor Cohen, at the time the president of The Island Def Jam Music Group, asked Thursday vocalist Geoff Rickly to speak positively about Island Records to Lacey in order to convince Brand New to sign with them. However, Lacey did not believe Rickly, as he noted how the label had told Thursday to rewrite their album &quot;War All the Time&quot; in order to placate the executives and did not want that happening to Brand New as well. Michael Goldstone, who at the time was leaving DreamWorks Records for Sire Records, told Interscope Records executive Luke Wood to sign Brand New; Wood recalled that &quot;for about six months, every label was trying to sign the band, chasing them all over the world. It was brutal.&quot; Vagrant Records had the money to match DreamWorks&#x27; offer, but Brand New ultimately signed with DreamWorks/Interscope.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Deja Entendu&quot; received very positive reviews from critics, who praised the band&#x27;s evolution from their debut album.

AllMusic gave &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; four out of five stars, stating that:As of 2003, Brand New had sidestepped any notion that they&#x27;d be stuck in the prototypical mold found on &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot;. Unlike their debut, &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; isn&#x27;t all about bitter breakups and doesn&#x27;t fall into a permanent punk-pop hole. Produced by Steven Haigler (Pixies, Quicksand), this sophomore effort finds Brand New maturing, reaching for textures and song structures instead of clichés.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album: &quot;&quot;Deja Entendu&quot; is an emo masterpiece if ever there was one, applying the intensity of post-hardcore and oddly sexy grooves to sophisticated and impassioned songwriting.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a positive review, complimenting its &quot;air of substance and maturity&quot; and comparing &quot;The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot&quot; to The Smiths.

&quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; gave the album five stars out of five, proclaiming that &quot;We could relate to the way that Lacey screamed &quot;This is the reason you&#x27;re alone, this is the rise and the fall&quot; at the end of &#x27;Tommy Gun.&#x27; We understood the desperation in his voice and the subtle undertones of sexual frustration in &#x27;Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis.&#x27; We were just beginning to see how brilliant the lyrics were to &#x27;Play Crack The Sky&#x27;, a song that simultaneously deals with love, death, and relationships on a singular metaphorical level. These emotions were new to us, and we had a feeling that they meant something to the man singing about them too.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; rated the album 9.7/10, calling it &quot;probably the best underground release this year.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The album ranked at No. 25 on Sputnikmusic&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Albums of the 2000s, one of two Brand New albums on the list (&quot;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me&quot; was included at No. 20). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at No. 19 in their list of the 40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time, ahead of &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; at No. 29. The album was included in &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 101 Modern Classics list at number 21. &quot;Rock Sound&quot; later wrote the album&#x27;s &quot;slow burn appeal and genre-defining quality&quot; would define the album as &quot;an emo classic.&quot; They also wrote it would become the &quot;blueprint [that] would spawn scores of imitators, [and] make alternative icons of its creators&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood The Test Of Time&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed it at No. 43 on its list of the 50 Greatest Pop Punk Albums.

In 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don&#x27;t&quot; as the 29th-best non-single &quot;deep cut&quot; from 2003. The song was also named one of the 15 biggest emo songs from the genre&#x27;s &quot;mainstream era&quot;.

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Brand New went on a tour of the US in July 2003 with support from Moneen, The Beautiful Mistake and Senses Fail, although tickets went on sale before the album came out and several dates sold out. Following the album&#x27;s release, Brand New was one of over 40 bands that performed at the 2003 Warped Tour, playing from July 23 to the tour&#x27;s close on August 10. After the Warped Tour, the band opened for Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s American dates in August. Brand New headlined another tour in late 2003, supported by Hot Rod Circuit and Eisley.

In January 2004, Brand New headlined their first tour of the United Kingdom, supported by Straylight Run and Moneen. In March 2004, Brand New supported Blink-182 on an arena tour of Australia. In May 2004, Brand New returned to the United Kingdom to support Incubus on an arena tour.

== Legacy ==
Jason Tate, the founder of AbsolutePunk, said that &quot;When they put out &quot;Deja&quot;, it was a completely scene-altering album at the time: what people were listening to, what was being made. It felt like such a shift in style. It was so good that literally overnight, bands were ripping it off and needed to make the next version of it.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;The lonely spaceman on its cover said it all… Jesse Lacey and co’s 2003 soul-purging was a punky, Morrisseyian essay on isolation.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; explained the album&#x27;s legacy as the moment when the band &quot;ditched the bottled-up energy of their debut for moody, textured, cavernous numbers that augmented Lacey&#x27;s acidic lyrics.&quot;

Fall Out Boy&#x27;s primary lyricist Pete Wentz said of &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; after its release, &quot;This is the future of music, Fall Out Boy is gonna aim towards this.&quot; Adam Siska, the bassist for The Academy Is..., noted the album&#x27;s influence on emo in a 2023 interview: &quot;When &quot;Deja&quot; came out, nothing was the same. Every band was starting to aim for this intelligent poetic lyricism, this sort of East Coast poetry, with long song titles.&quot; Geoff Rickly, the lead singer of Thursday, who had toured with Brand New during the &quot;Your Favorite Weapon&quot; era, did not believe that &quot;Deja Entendu&quot; was released by the same band, having written them off as &quot;just this pop-punk band.&quot;

<text>Kentoku (建徳) was a Japanese era of the Southern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts after Shōhei and before Bunchū, lasting from July 1370 to April 1372. The reigning emperors were Chōkei in the south and Go-En&#x27;yū in the north.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

==Nanboku-chō overview==

During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

<doc id="1183019" wikidata="Q1520733" url="?curid=1183019" title="Sweepstake">
<text>In the United States, a sweepstake is a type of contest where a prize or prizes may be awarded to a winner or winners. Sweepstakes began as a form of lottery that were tied to products sold. In response, the FCC and FTC refined U.S. broadcasting laws (creating the anti-lottery laws). Under these laws sweepstakes became strictly &quot;No purchase necessary to enter or win&quot; and &quot;A purchase will not increase your chances of winning&quot;, especially since many sweepstakes companies skirted the law by stating only &quot;no purchase necessary to enter&quot;, removing the consideration (one of the three legally required elements of gambling) to stop abuse of sweepstakes. Today, sweepstakes in the United States are used as marketing promotions to reward existing consumers and to draw attention to a product. By definition, the winner is determined by pure random chance rather than skill.

== Marketing ==
Sweepstakes with large grand prizes tend to attract more entries regardless of the odds of winning. Therefore, the value of smaller prizes usually totals much less than that of the top prize. Firms that rely on sweepstakes for attracting customers, such as Publishers Clearing House and Reader&#x27;s Digest, have also found that the more involved the entry process, the more entrants. Businesses often obtain marketing information about their customers from sweepstakes entries.

== Regulation ==

Because of their potential for abuse, sweepstakes are heavily regulated in many countries. The US, Canada, and individual US states all have laws covering sweepstakes, so there are special rules depending on where the entrant lives. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission exercises some authority over sweepstakes promotion and sweepstakes scams in the United States. Notably, sweepstakes in Canada, Australia, and several European countries require entrants to answer a skill testing question such as solving an elementary-school-level mathematical puzzle, or answering a simple general knowledge question, making it (in theory, at least) a contest of skill in order to overcome requirements that would classify sweepstakes as a form of gambling under their country&#x27;s legal definition. There are similar laws in Brazil.

== Australia ==
In Australia, a sweepstake is known as a competition, however the technical name for a consumer competition is a trade promotion lottery.

A trade promotion lottery is a free entry lottery conducted to promote goods or services supplied by a business. Unlike in the U.S., entrants may be required to purchase a product in order to enter a trade promotion in Australia.

Companies or promoters may require a trade promotion lottery permit if the winner(s) are to be chosen via an element of chance, i.e. a competition draw.

No permits are required for competitions that do not involve an element of chance in determining the winner or winners. Common examples include competitions where entrants are required to submit a photo or an answer to a question in 25 words or less.

Many compers (those who enjoy entering competitions) attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 people from the online competitions website lottos.com.au met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.

== The United Kingdom ==
Sweepstakes with an entry fee are considered in the UK to be lotteries under the Gambling Act 2005.

Most sweepstakes in the UK are small-scale. They are classed as &quot;work lotteries&quot;, &quot;residents&#x27; lotteries&quot;, or &quot;private society&quot; lotteries, and do not require a licence, provided that all the money staked is paid out as prize money.

The popularity of the term &quot;sweepstakes&quot; may derive from the Irish Sweepstakes, which were very popular from the 1930s to the 1980s.

There is a tradition of office sweepstakes (known as office pools in the U.S.), which are usually based on major sporting events such as the Grand National and the World Cup. Entrants pay an equal stake for each horse/team they draw out of the hat before the event. The winner then takes the pot. For horse racing events, the pot may be split between the horses that win, place, and show.

What an American would call a &quot;sweepstakes&quot; — a random prize draw promoting a commercial product — is likely to be labelled as a &quot;prize draw&quot; or &quot;competition&quot; in the UK.

In the UK, prize competitions and prize draws are free of statutory control under the Gambling Act 2005, but should follow the CAP Code.

== United States ==
In the United States, sweepstake sponsors are very careful to disassociate themselves from any suggestion that players must pay to enter, or pay to win, since this would constitute gambling. Sweepstakes typically involve enticements to enter a consumer promotion with prizes that range from substantial wins such as cars or large sums of money to smaller prizes that are currently popular with consumers. There should be no monetary cost to the entrant (although some sweepstakes require entrants to subscribe to a promotional mailing list, potentially exposing the entrant to an increase in junk mail, spam email, or telemarketing calls) and sweepstakes winners should also not be required to pay any kind of fee to receive their prizes.

As an example of a state policy on sweepstakes promotions, Tennessee residents are prohibited by a policy of the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission (and not a state law) from entering sweepstakes online sponsored by manufacturers of wines and liquors; however, Tennessee residents may enter many of these same sweepstakes promotions by entries delivered by the US Postal Service. Another example is that Tennessee state law prohibits sweepstakes agencies and sponsors from requiring sweepstakes prize winners to submit to &quot;in perpetuity&quot; publicity releases.

Most corporate-sponsored sweepstakes promoted in the United States limit entry to US citizens, although some allow entry by legal residents of both the United States and Canada.

Among the most popularly known sweepstakes in the United States were the American Family Publishers Sweepstakes (now defunct), Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes, and Reader&#x27;s Digest Sweepstakes, each of which strongly persuaded entrants to purchase magazine subscriptions by placing stickers on contest entry cardstock while promising multimillion-dollar (annuity) winners who will be &quot;announced on TV&quot;. The American Family Publishers sweepstakes used paid advertisements during NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; to announce its grand prize winners (for many years, its celebrity spokesman was Ed McMahon). All three companies eventually paid fines and penalties to a variety of states who initiated legal actions against them. Of those three companies, only Publishers Clearing House continues to use sweepstakes as a promotional device and as recently as 2010 paid $3.5 million to settle charges that it had violated the terms of a 2001 multi-state agreement for which it was fined $34 million.

Sweepstakes are frequently used by fast-food restaurants to boost business. One of the most popular has been the McDonald&#x27;s Monopoly &quot;instant-win&quot; game-piece promotion (To satisfy the &quot;no purchase necessary&quot; requirement, free game pieces are made available on request through the US mail). Soft drink companies also sponsor many sweepstakes, such as the Pepsi Billion Dollar Sweepstakes game and the Pepsi Stuff loyalty rewards program that allowed Pepsi drinkers to accumulate points from packages and cups and redeem them for merchandise. Pepsi Stuff was Pepsi&#x27;s largest and most successful long-term promotion ever and it ran for many years in the US and in many countries around the world. Other sponsors may require the submission of a UPC of a company product (with provision for receiving a &quot;free&quot; UPC) for entry into the sweepstakes drawing.

Sweepstakes parlors, which began to appear in the US around 2005, are establishments that offer chances to win cash prizes as a promotion for a product, usually either a telephone card or Internet access. Sweepstakes casinos use a similar model, offering promotional real money winning opportunities by playing casino-style games online.

Sweepstakes must be carefully planned to comply with local laws and curtail forms of entrant fraud and abuse. Before home computers were popular, a common method of entry was a mailed, plain 3&quot; × 5&quot; index card with the entrant&#x27;s name and address. Massive computer-printed entries resulted in a new requirement that entries must be &quot;hand-printed&quot;. Laser printers that can mimic ink pen writing are also a problem for sponsors. In most sweepstakes, entrants and their relatives must not be related to the sponsor or promoter.

Many state lotteries also run second-chance sweepstakes in conjunction with the retail sale of state lottery scratch cards in an effort to increase consumer demand for scratch cards and help control the litter caused by the improper disposal of non-winning lottery tickets. Since lottery tickets are considered to be bearer instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code, these lottery scratch card promotions can be entered with non-winning tickets that are picked up as litter.

<doc id="1183023" wikidata="Q2204417" url="?curid=1183023" title="Murder of Nicholas Green">
<text>Nicholas Green (September 9, 1987 – October 1, 1994) was an American boy who was shot and killed in an attempted car robbery while vacationing with his family in Southern Italy. Robbers mistook their family car for a jeweller&#x27;s. When Nicholas died, his parents chose to donate his organs. Five people received his major organs, and two received a cornea transplant.

==Death==
Nicholas Green, his sister, Eleanor Green, and their parents, Margaret and Reginald Green, were having a holiday in Calabria, Southern Italy. On the night of September 29, 1994 his parents were driving on the A3 motorway between Salerno and Reggio Calabria. They stopped at an Autogrill, where two men started following their car, believing they were jewellers. The men pulled up alongside the Greens&#x27; vehicle and shouted something in Italian, which the Greens did not understand. Reginald Green accelerated, at which point the men fired shots into the rear of the car. He accelerated a second time, and once again the men shot into the back of the car. After the pursuers gave up, Reginald stopped the car, and at this point he and Margaret realized that Nicholas had been shot in the head. They drove directly to the nearest town, but the hospital was not equipped to deal with Nicholas&#x27; injuries. The police took the family to Villa San Giovanni, where they transferred to a ferry which brought them across the Strait of Messina to the port of Messina. From there, the police took them to a specialist head injuries unit at a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead the next day.
==Aftermath==
===Family===
In May 1996 the Greens had twins, a girl (Laura) and a boy (Martin). Since their loss, the Greens have been strong supporters of organ donation and they have been traveling throughout the world to spread the message of donation and tell their story.

===Aftermath in Italy===
Following their decision of donating Nicholas&#x27; organs, Nicholas&#x27; parents were received by Italy&#x27;s President (Oscar Luigi Scalfaro). They were awarded Italy&#x27;s highest honour for civilians &quot;Medaglia d&#x27;Oro al Merito Civile&quot;. After Nicholas&#x27; death, donation rates increased dramatically in Italy, a country where organ donations had been among the lowest in Europe. According to 2017 data, organ donations in Italy have more than tripled since. Many elementary schools as well as city locations/addresses all over the country were named after Nicholas.

===Trial===
Following the shooting, Italian police arrested two Mafia men on November 2, 1994, Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello. They were tried in Catanzaro by a court consisting of three judges, and on January 17, 1997 they were found not guilty. Reginald Green had been unable to identify them, as the shooters had both been wearing masks, and it was dark. However, a year later, an appellate court with a jury convicted the pair. Iannello was sentenced to life imprisonment and Mesiano was sentenced to 20 years. This decision was upheld by Italy&#x27;s supreme court in 1999.
The Killer (Michele Iannello) later confessed other crimes but claimed that his brother (Giuseppe Iannello) is the murderer of Nicholas Green. 

===Organ donation===
After Nicholas&#x27; death, donation rates increased dramatically in Italy, a country where organ donations had been among the lowest in Europe. According to 2017 data, organ donations in Italy have more than tripled since. Nicholas&#x27; name continues to be associated with organ donation, and is acknowledged as the most famous organ donor in the world. The result of his parents&#x27; decision has been called &quot;The Nicholas Effect&quot; (l&#x27;Effetto Nicholas) and refers not only to organ donation but also to everything good that emerged from the tragedy.

==Memorials==
A memorial bell tower (The Children&#x27;s Bell Tower) has been built in Bodega Bay, California in memory of Nicholas Green and all the children, using more than 140 bells sent to the Greens from individuals, families, schools, and churches all over Italy. The monument, set in Bodega Bay, where Nicholas and his family lived, has become a place of pilgrimage as well as a tourist attraction. The central bell, donated by the Marinelli Foundry, that has been making bells for the Papacy for more than 1000 years, was blessed by Pope John Paul II. It has the names of the seven recipients of Nicholas&#x27; organs inscribed on it. The monument is the work of San Francisco sculptor Bruce Hasson.

Another sculpture, called &quot;The Birds&quot;, has been donated by the Greens to the Calabria Region and is located at the Regional Council Palace. It depicts seven birds (like Nicholas&#x27; organs that were donated and the number of the recipients) made of steel, floating in a sort of tower. This monument is also the work of Bruce Hasson. He used the steel of guns confiscated by the San Francisco Police Department.

An educational video has been made out of their story, called &#x27;The Nicholas Effect&#x27;. It is currently shown in hospitals all around the United States and is used by procurement organizations, hospitals, churches, to spread a message of solidarity and the importance of donation. It tells the story of Nicholas, how his organs saved the lives of seven very sick Italians, and how this thing changed the attitude of a whole country towards organ donation.
Since Nicholas died, organ donation rates in Italy have more than tripled, bringing Italy from being at the bottom among European Countries in donation to one of the top of the list (currently Italy is second, after Spain, as far as organ donation rates).

Reginald Green wrote two books: the first called &quot;The Nicholas Effect&quot; (&quot;Il Dono di Nicholas&quot;, in Italian) and the second called &quot;The Gift that Heals&quot; (&quot;Il Dono che Guarisce&quot;, in Italian), published jointly with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) - the non-profit organization that manages the United States&#x27;s organ transplant system under contract with the federal government.
Both books have been highly acclaimed by media and specialists of organ donation all around the world . They are used in nursing schools, hospitals, churches, since the books are considered a complete and useful work on organ donation.

The Greens also established an annual scholarship for primary and middle school children in the United States that is awarded to a distinguished student in each state. The award is managed by the NAGC (the National Association for Gifted Children).

The World Transplant Game Federation dedicated to Nicholas Green the ski race for transplanted children: it is the &quot;Nicholas Cup&quot;. It has been held in Nendaz, Switzerland in 2001, Bormio in Northern Italy in 2004, Poland in 2005, Rovaniemi, Finland in 2008, Anzere, Switzerland in March 2012 and La Chapelle D&#x27;Abondance France in January 2014.

In 1998, a TV movie, &quot;Nicholas&#x27; Gift&quot;, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Alan Bates, was based on the event.

Several schools, streets, gardens and squares in Italian cities have been named or renamed in honor of Nicholas Green. For the full list of places named for Nicholas Green in Italy and a map, visit Map of places named for Nicholas in Italy.

==Location==
The Children&#x27;s Bell Tower is located in Bodega Bay, off Route 1. GPS (N 38° 20.448 W 123° 03.126)

<doc id="1183024" wikidata="Q4644768" url="?curid=1183024" title="849 Naval Air Squadron">
<text>849 Naval Air Squadron was a squadron of the Fleet Air Arm, the Air Arm of the British Royal Navy. It was formed during the Second World War as a carrier based torpedo-bomber, unit, flying missions against Japanese targets in the Far East. Its service since the Second World War has been as an airborne early warning squadron, flying fixed winged Skyraiders and Gannets from the Royal Navy&#x27;s fixed wing carriers from 1952 until 1978, and airborne early warning Sea King helicopters from 1982 to 2018.

==Operational history==
===World War two===
849 Naval Air Squadron was formed on 1 August 1943 at the Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island with Grumman Avenger Is. It returned to the UK and provided anti-surface vessel and anti-submarine patrols over the English Channel prior to and during the D-Day operations.
In August 1944, it was sent to Ceylon to join the British Eastern Fleet, embarking on (and becoming part of the British Pacific Fleet in November 1944). It took part in Operation Lentil against oil installations at Pangkalan Brandan in Sumatra on 4 January 1945, and in the larger carrier strikes against the oil refineries at Palembang Sumatra (Operation Meridian) on 24 and 29 January.

&quot;Victorious&quot;, including 849 in its Carrier Air Group, took part in operations in support of the American invasion of Okinawa from March to May 1945, flying strikes against airfields used by Japanese &quot;Kamikaze&quot; aircraft on the Sakishima Islands and on Formosa. Still aboard &quot;Victorious&quot;, No. 849 took place in raids against the Japanese Home islands in July and August, including the bombing raids on 24 July that resulted in severe damage to the Japanese escort carrier &quot;Kaiyo&quot;. It disbanded on 31 October 1945.

===Airborne Early Warning (1953-78)===
The squadron reformed at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Culdrose on 7 July 1953, being equipped with ex United States Navy Douglas Skyraider AD4W as an Airborne Early Warning unit, from 778 Naval Air Squadron. These were operated by squadron detachments assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carriers HMS Ark Royal, Bulwark, Albion, Centaur, Eagle, Hermes and Victorious.

Following the retirement of the Skyraiders in December 1960, the unit flew the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 in the same role, operating from HMS Eagle, Ark Royal, Centaur, Hermes and Victorious. Gannet AS.4, COD.4 and T.5s were also operated in supporting roles. The squadron detachments continued as 849B (Ark Royal) and 849HQ (RAF Lossiemouth), until the squadron disbanded again on 15 December 1978.

In November 1970 Bristol Belle, one of the first hot air balloons to fly in UK, was piloted by Lt Terry Adams, accompanied by Lt Howard Draper both of 849 Squadron B Flight (Gannets). This early morning launch carried mail into Malta whilst the Ark Royal was steaming off the southern coast of that island.

===Helicopter AEW (1984 to 2018)===

It reformed after the lessons of the 1982 South Atlantic campaign had been learned, on 8 November 1984 and the unit then operated the Westland Sea King Mk7 Airborne Surveillance and Control (ASaC) helicopter. The squadron was stationed at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, operating 9 aircraft. It was divided into three elements - two flights (A and B), or Aardvarks and Bees and the Operational Conversion Unit (OCU)(Previously known as HQ). Historically, a Flight was assigned to each of the two active aircraft carriers in the Royal Navy. The squadron suffered heavy losses during the 2003 invasion of Iraq when two of its aircraft operating from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; collided during low visibility conditions. Six squadron members and an American exchange officer were killed in the collision.

On 13 December 2006, after a short ceremony at RNAS Culdrose, A Flight became 854 Squadron and B Flight became 857 Squadron, taking the former&#x27;s Sea King ASaC.7 with them.

In May 2014, the MOD announced that seven ASaC.7 helicopters, to be operated by 849 Naval Air Squadron, would remain in service with the RN through to the second half of 2018; the remainder of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Kings, of all types, were to be withdrawn by 2016.

854 and 857 Naval Air Squadrons were reabsorbed by 849 Naval Air Squadron in 2015, to form &#x27;Normandy&#x27; and &#x27;Palembang&#x27; flights respectively. The third flight in 849 NAS is &#x27;Okinawa Flight&#x27;.

=== Decommissioning ===

849NAS briefly operated a single Augusta Westland Merlin HM Mk2 from February 2020 in anticipation of the Mk2 receiving the Crowsnest upgraded ASaC system. 849 NAS decommissioned on 21 April 2020.

==Aircraft operated==
The squadron operated a variety of different aircraft and versions:
* Grumman Avenger I &amp; II
* Douglas Skyraider AEW.1
* Fairey Gannet AEW.3, AS.4, COD.4 &amp; T.5
* Westland Sea King AEW.2/2A
* Westland Sea King ASaC Mk7
* Augusta Westland Merlin HM Mk2

<doc id="1183025" wikidata="Q196823" url="?curid=1183025" title="Zeta potential">
<text>Zeta potential is the electrical potential at the slipping plane. This plane is the interface which separates mobile fluid from fluid that remains attached to the surface.

Zeta potential is a scientific term for electrokinetic potential in colloidal dispersions. In the colloidal chemistry literature, it is usually denoted using the Greek letter zeta (ζ), hence ζ-potential. The usual units are volts (V) or, more commonly, millivolts (mV). From a theoretical viewpoint, the zeta potential is the electric potential in the interfacial double layer (DL) at the location of the slipping plane relative to a point in the bulk fluid away from the interface. In other words, zeta potential is the potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the dispersed particle.

The zeta potential is caused by the net electrical charge contained within the region bounded by the slipping plane, and also depends on the location of that plane. Thus, it is widely used for quantification of the magnitude of the charge. However, zeta potential is not equal to the Stern potential or electric surface potential in the double layer, because these are defined at different locations. Such assumptions of equality should be applied with caution. Nevertheless, zeta potential is often the only available path for characterization of double-layer properties.

The zeta potential is an important and readily measurable indicator of the stability of colloidal dispersions. The magnitude of the zeta potential indicates the degree of electrostatic repulsion between adjacent, similarly charged particles in a dispersion. For molecules and particles that are small enough, a high zeta potential will confer stability, i.e., the solution or dispersion will resist aggregation. When the potential is small, attractive forces may exceed this repulsion and the dispersion may break and flocculate. So, colloids with high zeta potential (negative or positive) are electrically stabilized while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate as outlined in the table.

Zeta potential can also be used for the pKa estimation of complex polymers that is otherwise difficult to measure accurately using conventional methods. This can help studying the ionisation behaviour of various synthetic and natural polymers under various conditions and can help in establishing standardised dissolution-pH thresholds for pH responsive polymers. 

==Measurement==
Some new instrumentations techniques exist that allow zeta potential to be measured. The Zeta Potential Analyzer can measure solid, fibers, or powdered material. The motor found in the instrument creates an oscillating flow of electrolyte solution through the sample. Several sensors in the instrument monitor other factors, so the software attached is able to do calculations to find the zeta potential. Temperature, pH, conductivity, pressure, and streaming potential are all measured in the instrument for this reason. 

Zeta potential can also be calculated using theoretical models, and an experimentally-determined electrophoretic mobility or dynamic electrophoretic mobility. 

Electrokinetic phenomena and electroacoustic phenomena are the usual sources of data for calculation of zeta potential. (See Zeta potential titration.)

===Electrokinetic phenomena===

Electrophoresis is used for estimating zeta potential of particulates, whereas streaming potential/current is used for porous bodies and flat surfaces.
In practice, the zeta potential of dispersion is measured by applying an electric field across the dispersion. Particles within the dispersion with a zeta potential will migrate toward the electrode of opposite charge with a velocity proportional to the magnitude of the zeta potential.

This velocity is measured using the technique of the laser Doppler anemometer. The frequency shift or phase shift of an incident laser beam caused by these moving particles is measured as the particle mobility, and this mobility is converted to the zeta potential by inputting the dispersant viscosity and dielectric permittivity, and the application of the Smoluchowski theories.

====Electrophoresis====

Electrophoretic mobility is proportional to electrophoretic velocity, which is the measurable parameter. There are several theories that link electrophoretic mobility with zeta potential. They are briefly described in the article on electrophoresis and in details in many books on colloid and interface science.
 There is an IUPAC Technical Report prepared by a group of world experts on the electrokinetic phenomena.
From the instrumental viewpoint, there are three different experimental techniques: microelectrophoresis, electrophoretic light scattering, and tunable resistive pulse sensing. Microelectrophoresis has the advantage of yielding an image of the moving particles. On the other hand, it is complicated by electro-osmosis at the walls of the sample cell. Electrophoretic light scattering is based on dynamic light scattering. It allows measurement in an open cell which eliminates the problem of electro-osmotic flow except for the case of a capillary cell. And, it can be used to characterize very small particles, but at the price of the lost ability to display images of moving particles. Tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) is an impedance-based measurement technique that measures the zeta potential of individual particles based on the duration of the resistive pulse signal. The translocation duration of nanoparticles is measured as a function of voltage and applied pressure. From the inverse translocation time versus voltage-dependent electrophoretic mobility, and thus zeta potentials are calculated. The main advantage of the TRPS method is that it allows for simultaneous size and surface charge measurements on a particle-by-particle basis, enabling the analysis of a wide spectrum of synthetic and biological nano/microparticles and their mixtures.

All these measuring techniques may require dilution of the sample. Sometimes this dilution might affect properties of the sample and change zeta potential. There is only one justified way to perform this dilution – by using equilibrium supernatant. In this case, the interfacial equilibrium between the surface and the bulk liquid would be maintained and zeta potential would be the same for all volume fractions of particles in the suspension. When the diluent is known (as is the case for a chemical formulation), additional diluent can be prepared. If the diluent is unknown, equilibrium supernatant is readily obtained by centrifugation.

==== Streaming potential, streaming current ====

The streaming potential is an electric potential that develops during the flow of liquid through a capillary. In nature, a streaming potential may occur at a significant magnitude in areas with volcanic activities. The streaming potential is also the primary electrokinetic phenomenon for the assessment of the zeta potential at the solid material-water interface. A corresponding solid sample is arranged in such a way to form a capillary flow channel. Materials with a flat surface are mounted as duplicate samples that are aligned as parallel plates. The sample surfaces are separated by a small distance to form a capillary flow channel. Materials with an irregular shape, such as fibers or granular media, are mounted as a porous plug to provide a pore network, which serves as capillaries for the streaming potential measurement. Upon the application of pressure on a test solution, liquid starts to flow and to generate an electric potential. This streaming potential is related to the pressure gradient between the ends of either a single flow channel (for samples with a flat surface) or the porous plug (for fibers and granular media) to calculate the surface zeta potential.

Alternatively to the streaming potential, the measurement of streaming current offers another approach to the surface zeta potential. Most commonly, the classical equations derived by Maryan Smoluchowski are used to convert streaming potential or streaming current results into the surface zeta potential.

Applications of the streaming potential and streaming current method for the surface zeta potential determination consist of the characterization of surface charge of polymer membranes, biomaterials and medical devices, and minerals.

===Electroacoustic phenomena===

There are two electroacoustic effects that are widely used for characterizing zeta potential: colloid vibration current and electric sonic amplitude. There are commercially available instruments that exploit these effects for measuring dynamic electrophoretic mobility, which depends on zeta potential.

Electroacoustic techniques have the advantage of being able to perform measurements in intact samples, without dilution. Published and well-verified theories allow such measurements at volume fractions up to 50%. Calculation of zeta potential from the dynamic electrophoretic mobility requires information on the densities for particles and liquid. In addition, for larger particles exceeding roughly 300 nm in size information on the particle size required as well.

==Calculation==
The most known and widely used theory for calculating zeta potential from experimental data is that developed by Marian Smoluchowski in 1903. This theory was originally developed for electrophoresis; however, an extension to electroacoustics is now also available. Smoluchowski&#x27;s theory is powerful because it is valid for dispersed particles of any shape and any concentration. However, it has its limitations:
*Detailed theoretical analysis proved that Smoluchowski&#x27;s theory is valid only for a sufficiently thin double layer, when the Debye length, formula_1, is much smaller than the particle radius, formula_2:

::formula_3

:The model of the &quot;thin double layer&quot; offers tremendous simplifications not only for electrophoresis theory but for many other electrokinetic and electroacoustic theories. This model is valid for most aqueous systems because the Debye length is typically only a few nanometers in water. The model breaks only for nano-colloids in a solution with ionic strength approaching that of pure water.

*Smoluchowski&#x27;s theory neglects the contribution of surface conductivity. This is expressed in modern theories as the condition of a small Dukhin number:

::formula_4

The development of electrophoretic and electroacoustic theories with a wider range of validity was a purpose of many studies during the 20th century. There are several analytical theories that incorporate surface conductivity and eliminate the restriction of the small Dukhin number for both the electrokinetic and electroacoustic applications.

Early pioneering work in that direction dates back to Overbeek and Booth.

Modern, rigorous electrokinetic theories that are valid for any zeta potential, and often any formula_5, stem mostly from Soviet Ukrainian (Dukhin, Shilov, and others) and Australian (O&#x27;Brien, White, Hunter, and others) schools. Historically, the first one was Dukhin–Semenikhin theory. A similar theory was created ten years later by O&#x27;Brien and Hunter. Assuming a thin double layer, these theories would yield results that are very close to the numerical solution provided by O&#x27;Brien and White. There are also general electroacoustic theories that are valid for any values of Debye length and Dukhin number.

=== Henry&#x27;s equation ===
When κa is between large values where simple analytical models are available, and low values where numerical calculations are valid, Henry&#x27;s equation can be used when the zeta potential is low. For a nonconducting sphere, Henry&#x27;s equation is formula_6, where &quot;f&quot;1 is the Henry function, one of a collection of functions which vary smoothly from 1.0 to 1.5 as κa approaches infinity.

<text>Engen (延元) was a Japanese era of the Southern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts after Kenmu and before Kōkoku, lasting from February 1336 to April 1340. The reigning Emperors were Emperor Go-Daigo and Emperor Go-Murakami in the south and Emperor Kōmyō in the north.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

<doc id="1183041" wikidata="Q3406257" url="?curid=1183041" title="Quadratic residuosity problem">
<text>The quadratic residuosity problem (QRP) in computational number theory is to decide, given integers formula_1 and formula_2, whether formula_1 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2 or not.
Here formula_5 for two unknown primes formula_6 and formula_7, and formula_1 is among the numbers which are not obviously quadratic non-residues (see below).

The problem was first described by Gauss in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; in 1801. 
This problem is believed to be computationally difficult.
Several cryptographic methods rely on its hardness, see .

An efficient algorithm for the quadratic residuosity problem immediately implies efficient algorithms for other number theoretic problems, such as deciding whether a composite formula_2 of unknown factorization is the product of 2 or 3 primes.

== Precise formulation ==

Given integers formula_1 and formula_11, formula_1 is said to be a &quot;quadratic residue modulo formula_11&quot; if there exists an integer formula_14 such that
:formula_15.
Otherwise we say it is a quadratic non-residue.
When formula_16 is a prime, it is customary to use the Legendre symbol:
:formula_17

This is a multiplicative character which means formula_18 for exactly formula_19 of the values formula_20, and it is formula_21 for the remaining.

It is easy to compute using the law of quadratic reciprocity in a manner akin to the Euclidean algorithm; see Legendre symbol.

Consider now some given formula_5 where formula_6 and formula_7 are two different unknown primes.
A given formula_1 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2 if and only if formula_1 is a quadratic residue modulo both formula_6 and formula_7 and formula_30.

Since we don&#x27;t know formula_6 or formula_7, we cannot compute formula_33 and formula_34. However, it is easy to compute their product.
This is known as the Jacobi symbol:
:formula_35

This also can be efficiently computed using the law of quadratic reciprocity for Jacobi symbols.

However, formula_36 cannot in all cases tell us whether formula_1 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2 or not!
More precisely, if formula_39 then formula_1 is necessarily a quadratic non-residue modulo either formula_6 or formula_7, in which case we are done.
But if formula_43 then it is either the case that formula_1 is a quadratic residue modulo both formula_6 and formula_7, or a quadratic non-residue modulo both formula_6 and formula_7.
We cannot distinguish these cases from knowing just that formula_43.

This leads to the precise formulation of the quadratic residue problem:

Problem:
Given integers formula_1 and formula_5, where formula_6 and formula_7 are distinct unknown primes, and where formula_43, determine whether formula_1 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2 or not.

== Distribution of residues ==

If formula_1 is drawn uniformly at random from integers formula_58 such that formula_43, is formula_1 more often a quadratic residue or a quadratic non-residue modulo formula_2?

As mentioned earlier, for exactly half of the choices of formula_62, then formula_63, and for the rest we have formula_64.
By extension, this also holds for half the choices of formula_65.
Similarly for formula_7.
From basic algebra, it follows that this partitions formula_67 into 4 parts of equal size, depending on the sign of formula_33 and formula_34.

The allowed formula_1 in the quadratic residue problem given as above constitute exactly those two parts corresponding to the cases formula_71 and formula_72.
Consequently, exactly half of the possible formula_1 are quadratic residues and the remaining are not.

==Applications==

The intractability of the quadratic residuosity problem is the basis for the security of the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator. It also yields the public key Goldwasser–Micali cryptosystem, as well as the identity based Cocks scheme.

<doc id="1183043" wikidata="Q854990" url="?curid=1183043" title="Kagemusha">
<text>is a 1980 epic jidaigeki film directed by Akira Kurosawa. It is set in the Sengoku period of Japanese history and tells the story of a lower-class petty thief who is taught to impersonate the dying &quot;daimyō&quot; Takeda Shingen to dissuade opposing lords from attacking the newly vulnerable clan. &quot;Kagemusha&quot; is the Japanese term for a political decoy, literally meaning &quot;shadow warrior&quot;. The film ends with the climactic 1575 Battle of Nagashino.

The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival (tied with &quot;All That Jazz&quot;). It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received other honours. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;.

==Plot==
During the Sengoku period, in 1571, Takeda Shingen, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kai province from the Takeda clan, meets a thief his brother Nobukado has spared from crucifixion due to the thief&#x27;s uncanny resemblance to Shingen. The brothers agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a &quot;kagemusha&quot;, a political decoy. Later, while the Takeda army lays siege to a castle belonging to Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shingen is shot while listening to a flute playing in the enemy camp. He orders his forces to withdraw and, before succumbing to his wound, commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Meanwhile, Shingen&#x27;s rivals Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Uesugi Kenshin puzzle over the reason for Shingen&#x27;s withdrawal, unaware of his death.

Nobukado presents the thief to Shingen&#x27;s generals, proposing to have him impersonate Shingen full-time. Although the thief is unaware of Shingen&#x27;s death initially, he eventually finds Shingen&#x27;s preserved corpse in a large jar, having believed it to contain treasure. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and release him. Later, the jar is dropped into Lake Suwa, which spies working for the Tokugawa and Oda forces witness. Suspecting that Shingen has died, the spies go to report their observation, but the thief, having overheard the spies, returns to the Takeda forces and offers to work as a &quot;kagemusha&quot;. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were simply making an offering of sake to the god of the lake, and the spies are ultimately convinced by the thief&#x27;s performance.

Returning home, the &quot;kagemusha&quot; convinces Shingen&#x27;s retinue by imitating the late warlord&#x27;s gestures and learning more about him. When the &quot;kagemusha&quot; must preside over a clan meeting, he is instructed by Nobukado to remain silent until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the &quot;kagemusha&quot; will simply agree with the generals&#x27; plan and dismiss the council. However, Shingen&#x27;s son Katsuyori is incensed by his father&#x27;s decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the &quot;kagemusha&quot; in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen&#x27;s death. He directly asks the &quot;kagemusha&quot; what course of action should be taken, but the &quot;kagemusha&quot; is able to answer convincingly in Shingen&#x27;s own manner, which further convinces the generals.

In 1573, Nobunaga mobilizes his forces to attack Azai Nagamasa, continuing his campaign in central Honshu to maintain his control of Kyoto against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda forces launch an attack against the Takeda, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of his generals. The &quot;kagemusha&quot; is then forced to lead reinforcements in the Battle of Takatenjin, and he helps inspire the troops to victory. However, in a later fit of overconfidence, the &quot;kagemusha&quot; attempts to ride Shingen&#x27;s notoriously temperamental horse, and falls off. When those who rush to help him see that he does not have Shingen&#x27;s battle scars, he is revealed as an impostor, and is driven out in disgrace, allowing Katsuyori to take over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa forces are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland.

By 1575, now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads a counter-offensive against Nobunaga in Nagashino. Although courageous in their assault, several waves of Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of gunfire from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The &quot;kagemusha&quot;, who has followed the Takeda army, desperately takes up a spear and charges toward the Oda lines before being shot himself. Mortally wounded, the &quot;kagemusha&quot; attempts to retrieve the &quot;fūrinkazan&quot; banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds and is carried away by the current.

==Production==

George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola are credited at the end of the film as executive producers in the international version. This is because they persuaded 20th Century-Fox to make up a shortfall in the film&#x27;s budget when the original producers, Toho Studios, could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century-Fox received the international distribution rights to the film. Coppola and Kurosawa appeared together in Suntory whisky commercials to raise money for the production.

Kurosawa originally cast the actor Shintaro Katsu in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the Criterion Collection DVD, executive producer Coppola states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa&#x27;s filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa&#x27;s previous films. Nakadai played both the &quot;kagemusha&quot; and the lord whom he impersonated.

Kurosawa wrote a part in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; for his longtime regular actor Takashi Shimura, and &quot;Kagemusha&quot; was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a Catholic missionary and doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The Criterion Collection DVD release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film.

According to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the &quot;cutting-room floor&quot;.

<doc id="1183050" wikidata="Q1193970" url="?curid=1183050" title="Kenmu">
<text>was a Japanese era name of the Northern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts after &quot;Shōkei&quot; and before &quot;Ryakuō.&quot; Although Kemmu is understood by the Southern Court as having begun at the same time, the era was construed to have begun after &quot;Genkō&quot; and before &quot;Engen.&quot;

This period spanned the years from January 1334 through August 1338 in the North, and until only February 1336 in the Southern Court. The reigning Emperors were Emperor Go-Daigo in the south and Emperor Kōmyō in the north.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose Southern Court been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate Northern Court had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

==Change of era==
* 1333, also called : The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Shōkei&quot; 1 as time was reckoned in the Northern Court in Kyoto; and the era began in &quot;Genkō &quot; 4, as time was ordered in the Southern Court in Yoshino.

==Events of the Kenmu era ==
* 1333–1336 (&quot;Kenmu&quot;): The Kenmu Restoration was an attempt by Emperor Go-Daigo to restore Imperial authority after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate. The short-lived restoration was thwarted by Ashikaga Takauji who established a new bakufu which came to be known as the Ashikaga shogunate or the Muromachi shogunate. The failure of the restoration resulted in the creation of two rival Imperial courts which struggled for supremacy until 1392.
* 1334 (&quot;Kenmu 1&quot;): Emperor Go-Daigo caused &quot;Kenmu nenchū gyōji&quot; to be written. This was a book which described the ceremonies of the court; and its purpose was to aid the process of reviving ancient court etiquette.
* October 25, 1334 (&quot;Kenmu 1, 27th day of the 9th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Daigo made an Imperial progress to Kamo-jinja. No other emperor would visit Kamo&#x27;s shrines until April 29, 1863 (&quot;Bunkyū 3, 11th day of the 3rd month&quot;), when Emperor Kōmei made an Imperial progress to Kamo-jinja accompanied by the shōgun, all the principal officials and many feudal lords. This was the first Imperial progress since Go-Mizunoo visited Nijō Castle more than 230 years before.
* 1336 (&quot;Kenmu 3&quot;): An anonymous author published &quot;Kenmu nenkan ki,&quot; which was a chronicle of the Kemmu era. The text is a source of information about laws, government, bureaucrats, and arable lands and estates given by the emperor to the nobility or to religious institutions (&quot;shōen&quot;).
* 1336 (&quot;Kenmu 3&quot;): Ashikaga Takauji promulgated the &quot;Kenmu-shikimoku,&quot; which was a legal code with 17 articles addressing the behavior of the nobles.

<doc id="1183053" wikidata="Q385657" url="?curid=1183053" title="Canthaxanthin">
<text>Canthaxanthin is a keto-carotenoid pigment widely distributed in nature. Carotenoids belong to a larger class of phytochemicals known as terpenoids. The chemical formula of canthaxanthin is C40H52O2. It was first isolated in edible mushrooms. It has also been found in green algae, bacteria, crustaceans, and bioaccumulates in fish such as carp, golden grey mullet, seabream and trush wrasse.

Canthaxanthin is associated with E number E161g and is approved for use as a food coloring agent in different countries, including the United States and the EU; however, it is not approved for use in Australia and New Zealand. It is generally authorized for feed applications in at least the following countries: US, Canada, EU. In the EU, canthaxanthin is allowed by law to be added to trout feed, salmon feed and poultry feed. The European Union limit is 80 mg/kg of feedstuffs, 8 mg/kg in feed for egg laying hens and 25 mg/kg in feed for other poultry and salmonids.

Canthaxanthin is a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant. The biological functions of canthaxanthin are related, at least in part, to its ability to function as an antioxidant (free radical scavenging/vitamin E sparing) in animal tissues.

== Biosynthesis ==
Due to the commercial value of carotenoids, their biosynthesis has been studied extensively in both natural producers, and non-natural (heterologous) systems such as the bacteria &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Canthaxanthin biosynthesis proceeds from beta-carotene via the action of a single protein, known as a beta-carotene ketolase, that is able to add a carbonyl group to carbon 4 and 4&#x27; of the beta carotene molecule.
Although functionally identical, several distinct beta-carotene ketolase proteins are known. That is to say they differ from an evolutionary perspective in their primary amino acid/protein sequence. They are different proteins that complete the same function. Thus, bacterial (CrtW) and micro-algal beta-carotene ketolase proteins such as &quot;BKT&quot; isolated from &quot;Haematococcus pluvialis&quot; are known.
Due to the nature of canthaxanthin, relative to astaxanthin (a carotenoid of significant commercial value) these beta-carotene ketolase proteins have been studied extensively. An &quot;E. coli&quot; based production system has been developed, that achieved canthanaxanthin production at 170 mg/L in lab scale fermentation.

== Presence in fish ==
Canthaxanthin is not found in wild Atlantic Salmon, but is a minor carotenoid in Pacific Salmon. Canthaxanthin is used in farm-raised trout. Canthaxanthin is used in combination with astaxanthin for some salmon feeds.

== Presence in birds ==
The antioxidant characteristics of canthaxanthin have been studied by a number of authors and experiments have shown that the presence of canthaxanthin can potentially help to reduce oxidation in a number of tissues including broiler meat and the chick embryo. In the egg, canthaxanthin is transferred from yolk to the developing embryo where it might help to protect the developing bird against oxidative damage, particularly during the sensitive periods of hatching and early posthatch life. Flamingos are known to produce crop milk containing canthaxanthin for this purpose.

== Effects on human pigmentation and health ==
When ingested for the purpose of simulating a tan, its deposition in the panniculus imparts a golden orange hue to the skin.

In the late 1980s, the safety of canthaxanthin as a feed and a food additive was drawn into question as a result of a completely un-related use of the same carotenoid. A reversible deposition of canthaxanthin crystals was discovered in the retina of a limited number of people who had consumed very high amounts of canthaxanthin via sun-tanning pills – after stopping the pills, the deposits disappeared and the health of those people affected was fully recovered. However, the level of canthaxanthin intake in the affected individuals was many times greater than that which could ever be consumed via poultry products - to reach a similar intake, an individual would have to consume more than 50 eggs per day, produced by hens fed practical levels of canthaxanthin in their diets. Moreover, it was demonstrated by Hueber et al. that ingestions of canthaxanthin cause no long-term adverse effects, and that the phenomenon of crystal deposition on the retina is reversible and does not result in morphological changes. Although this incidence was totally unrelated and very different from the feed or food use of canthaxanthin, as a link had been drawn between canthaxanthin and human health, it was important that the use of canthaxanthin as a feed and food additive should be reviewed in detail by the relevant authorities, both in the EU and at an international level. The first stage of this review process was completed in 1995 with the publication by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for canthaxanthin of 0.03 mg/kg bodyweight. The work of JECFA was subsequently reviewed and accepted within the EU by the SCF (EU Scientific Committee for Food) in 1997. The conclusion of both these committees was that canthaxanthin is safe for humans. Recently (2010), the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient sources added to food (ANS) published a revised version of the safety assessment of Canthaxanthin, reconfirming the already set ADI. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no &quot;tanning pills&quot; approved for sale in the United States. In spite of this, there are companies that continue to market such products, some of which contain canthaxanthin. The FDA considers such items &quot;adulterated cosmetics&quot; and as a result sent warning letters to the firms citing such products as containing &quot;a color additive that is unsafe within the meaning of section 721(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (FD&amp;C Act, sec. 601(e)).&quot;

According to the FDA,

<doc id="1183057" wikidata="Q16997479" url="?curid=1183057" title="McDonald's Monopoly">
<text>The McDonald&#x27;s Monopoly game is a sales promotion run by fast food restaurant chain McDonald&#x27;s, with a theme based on the Hasbro board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The game first ran in the U.S. in 1987 and has since been used worldwide.

The promotion has used other names, such as &quot;Monopoly: Pick Your Prize!&quot; (2001), &quot;Monopoly Best Chance Game&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;Monopoly/Millionaire Game&quot; (2013), &quot;Prize Vault&quot; (2014), &quot;Money Monopoly&quot; (2016–present), &quot;Coast To Coast&quot; (2015–2024) Double Play (2024-present) in Canada, &quot;Golden Chances&quot; (2015), &quot;Prize Choice&quot; (2016), &quot;Win Win&quot; (2017), &quot;Wiiiin!!&quot; (2018), &quot;V.I.P.&quot; (2021), Double Peel (2022, 2023) and Power Peel (2024) in the UK.

==History==
The promotion was first offered in the United States, in 1987. Following countries included Canada, Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Argentina and Brazil were included in 2013 as well as South Korea in 2014 and Ireland in 2016. From 2003 to 2009, Best Buy was involved in the U.S. version, and later in the Canadian version.

Like many merchants, McDonald&#x27;s offered sweepstakes to draw customers into its restaurants. Laws generally forbid a company from administering its own contests, in order to prevent fraud and to ensure that all prizes are given away; as a result, such promotions are handled by an impartial third-party company. McDonald&#x27;s had a relationship with Simon Worldwide Inc., which was responsible for the distribution of the contest pieces and the awarding of major prizes.

In 2015, the Monopoly game was replaced in the US by &quot;Game Time Gold&quot;, using an NFL theme.

In 2020, in the UK, it was intended to run in March that year, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the promotion was postponed. Instead, the same promotion &quot;Monopoly VIP&quot; was instead run in 2021. As a result of its being postponed, the stickers for that year&#x27;s promotion had incorrect dates, as they were originally printed the year prior.

==Gameplay==

The promotion mimics the game &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The game is also advertised with tokens appearing in Sunday newspapers. Originally, customers received a set of two tokens with every purchase, but now tokens come only with certain menu items. Tokens correspond to a property space on the Monopoly board (with the exception of the &quot;Golden Avenue/Arches Avenue&quot; &quot;properties&quot;, which were added in the 2008 edition; and &quot;Electric Company/Water Works&quot; utilities added in 2014). When combined into color-matched properties, the tokens may be redeemed for money. Historically, the grand prize ($1 million, annuity only) has been the combination of the two most costly properties, Park Place and Boardwalk, but in the 2006–2007 games the top prize ($5 million, with the traditional $1 million prize for Boardwalk/Park Place) was awarded for collecting the four railroads.

There are also &quot;instant win&quot; tokens the recipient can redeem for McDonald&#x27;s food (typically small menu items, such as a free small McFlurry or medium fries) but never for any food item that has game pieces, money, or other prizes. The 2001 edition was titled &quot;Pick Your Prize!&quot;, in which winners could choose which of three ways they wanted their prize awarded (i.e., they could choose gold, diamonds, or $50,000 per year for 20 years).

In 2016, the game changed so that all available prizes were cash, including the $1 million for Park Place and Boardwalk, and was titled &quot;Money Monopoly&quot;.

===Coupon pieces===
Additionally, in the 2005 edition, certain foods always came with one coupon which could be used at either Best Buy, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, or Foot Locker (including online stores). The value of each coupon was random, with Toys R Us coupons ranging from $1 to $5; up to $5 in coupons could be used in a single transaction. In 2008, these coupons were redeemed for up to 25% off any Foot Locker item(s). Since 2009, the promotion has not featured any coupons.

Canadian and US laws require that game pieces be available upon request with no purchase necessary (Alternative Method of Entry, &quot;AMOE&quot;), and can be requested by the mailing of a handwritten, self-addressed stamped envelope.

===Unclaimed prizes===
Many of the prizes stay unclaimed. For example, in 2018, 25 million instant food prizes were offered in the promotion in the UK. However, only 8 million prizes were claimed overall. Out of 20 Mini Coopers offered, only 6 were claimed.

===Rare pieces in US/Canada===

The rare collectible pieces that dictate the odds of winning are as follows:


In 2013, McDonald&#x27;s allowed two Boardwalk pieces to be produced; prior to this only one was produced. McDonald&#x27;s added Golden Avenue and Arches Avenue for 2008 only; obtaining both won $100,000. For 2014 only, McDonald&#x27;s added Electric Company and Water Works; obtaining both won $10,000. For 2014 only, Free Parking was added, with a $100,000 prize.
===Online games===
In 2005, McDonald&#x27;s introduced an online counterpart to its traditional game. In addition to the traditional &quot;sticker&quot; game, participants can play online. Each game piece lists a code which can be entered online, to a maximum of 10 entries per 24 hours, a day starts at midnight EDT. Up to 2014, each code entered grants the user one roll on a virtual Monopoly game board, identical to the board game&#x27;s board. Rolling &quot;doubles&quot; (two dice sharing the same number), as with the real board game, allows the user to move again.

Landing on Electric Company, Income Tax, Jail/Just Visiting, Go to Jail, Water Works, or Luxury Tax does not count towards any prize. If a player lands on an unowned property (not landed upon by the player in a previous turn), the user will &quot;collect&quot; that property. When all properties of a colored set are collected, the user wins a prize, with prize values similar to those of the sticker game. In addition to collecting property sets, users can also win by landing on certain &quot;instant win&quot; spaces, including Go, Chance, Community Chest, and Free Parking. Landing on Go (but not simply passing it) gives the player a code worth one free hour of WiFi access at participating McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. Landing on Chance is worth money to spend at Foot Locker. Landing on Community Chest allows the user to be given a code worth 25 My Coke Rewards points. Landing on Free Parking is a prize of a $50 refillable gas card from Shell, or alternatively 25 complimentary apple pies.

In 2007, landing on Community Chest won game downloads.

In 2009, the prizes became two hours of Wi-Fi and a $25 Arch Card for landing on Go, an entry into an online roll for $1,000,000 (annuity) for landing on Chance, 25 My Coke Rewards points for landing on Community Chest, and a $50 refillable Shell gift card for landing on Free Parking.

The values of the dice are not random. As stated in the contest rules, one property in each set is &quot;rare,&quot; similar to the sticker game. These rare properties are landed on only when the game server &quot;seeds&quot; a winning roll. Winning rolls are seeded at specific times on specific dates, and the first user to roll the dice once a win has been seeded will land on a winning piece. This allows McDonald&#x27;s to declare the odds of winning certain prizes, a legal requirement for contests in most jurisdictions.

In 2010, the online game was changed, removing the dice and the game board, presenting only 3 Chance cards from which to pick. One has a prize, starting at 30 My Coke Rewards points, but may be (non-randomly) seeded with a higher-valued prize. Player chooses one card, is asked if that is the choice the player wants to make, and the card is flipped. If it is the pre-selected winning card, the player wins the pre-selected prize.

In 2011, the game was changed again – the mascot, Rich Uncle Pennybags (aka &quot;Mr. Monopoly&quot;), is shown attempting to throw a Chance card into a top hat. If the card lands in the hat, the player can claim a prize. Players must choose a &quot;throwing style&quot;, which only changes the animations used – it does nothing to affect one&#x27;s odds of winning.

In 2012, the game was changed once more. Players must click on &quot;Spin&quot; first, and if it landed on &quot;GO!&quot;, the player wins the online prize shown. The next year, players had to click on &quot;Play&quot;; a win resulted in the prize shown onscreen; regardless of the outcome, players received an entry to win a 2013 Fiat 500 Cabrio. For the 2014 game, players must click on &quot;GO!&quot;, and if it results in a win, the online prize is shown onscreen; regardless of the outcome, the participant receives an entry to win $50,000.

In 2016, players can enter up to ten codes daily in order to win weekly sweepstakes with a $50,000 grand prize.

===Restrictions===
For all versions of the online game, players are restricted to a set number of online entries per day. In the UK, this is restricted to 24 entries. In the US, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Saipan, the limit is 10.

Players in the UK must be aged 18 years or older.

== Criticism ==
The promotion has been criticized for incentivizing ordering more and upsizing the portions. In 2019, Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party, Tom Watson, said that the Monopoly promotion was a &quot;danger to public health&quot; and urged McDonald&#x27;s to drop the &quot;grotesque marketing strategy&quot;.

===Fraud===
In 2001, the U.S. promotion was halted after fraud was uncovered. A subcontracting company, Simon Marketing (then a subsidiary of Cyrk), which had been hired by McDonald&#x27;s to organize and promote the game, failed to recognize a flaw in its procedures. Simon&#x27;s chief of security Jerome P. Jacobson (&quot;Uncle Jerry&quot;), a former police officer, stole the most valuable game pieces. Jacobson justified his long-running multimillion-dollar crime as his reaction to Simon executives having rerun randomized draws to ensure that high-level prizes went to areas in the United States rather than Canada, although he did not take the stolen pieces to Canada. He began stealing winning game pieces after a supplier mistakenly provided him a sheet of the anti-tamper seals needed to securely conduct the legitimate transfer of winning pieces. Jacobson first offered the game pieces to friends and family but eventually began selling them to Gennaro &quot;Jerry&quot; Colombo of the Colombo crime family, whom he had met by chance at the Atlanta airport. Colombo would then recruit people to act as contest winners in exchange for half of the winnings.

In 1995, Colombo appeared in a nationally televised McDonald&#x27;s commercial promoting his (fraudulent) win of a Dodge Viper. In 1995, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, received an anonymous letter with a Dallas, Texas, postmark that contained a $1 million winning game piece. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald&#x27;s awarded the $1 million as a donation to the hospital, making the final $50,000 annuity payment in 2014. Investigations later revealed that Jacobson had admitted to sending the winning piece to the hospital. In June 1996, Colombo&#x27;s father-in-law William &quot;Buddy&quot; Fisher came forward as a winner with a stolen $1 million Monopoly piece. After Colombo died in a 1998 traffic accident, Jacobson found new accomplices to help him sell the stolen game pieces.

Jacobson&#x27;s associates and those of his collaborators won almost all of the top prizes, including cash and cars, between 1995 and 2000, including McDonald&#x27;s giveaways outside of the Monopoly promotion. The associates netted over $24 million. While the fraud appeared to have been perpetrated by only one key employee of the promotion company, and not by the company&#x27;s management, eight people were originally arrested, soon growing to 21 indicted people, including members of the Colombo crime family. By the end of the criminal prosecutions, 53 people were indicted, of whom 48 pled guilty: 46 in pretrial plea agreements and two who changed their pleas from not guilty to guilty during their trials.

McDonald&#x27;s severed its relationship with Simon Marketing and each company filed lawsuits against the other for breach of contract that were eventually settled out of court. The case brought forth by McDonald&#x27;s was dismissed but Simon received $16.6 million. Four of the putative winners convicted of fraud had their convictions reversed on appeal on grounds of a constitutional violation, as they did not know Jacobson and thus did not know that the winning game pieces were necessarily stolen.

Jacobson pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud in federal court in Jacksonville, Florida, and served three years in federal prison. The trial began on September 10, 2001, but was overshadowed in the media by the September 11 attacks that occurred the next day.

In August 2018, 20th Century Fox announced plans for a film based on the Jacobson fraud, with Ben Affleck attached as director, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese as writers and Matt Damon in an acting role. While there have been no further updates on the plans for the film, the controversy is depicted in the 2020 HBO docuseries &quot;McMillions&quot;.

<doc id="1183062" wikidata="Q1687592" url="?curid=1183062" title="Steven Emerson">
<text>Steven Emerson (born June 6, 1954) is an American investigative journalist, author, and pundit on national security, terrorism, and Islamic extremism. He is the founder and director of The Investigative Project on Terrorism, and received a George Polk Award for the 1994 documentary &quot;Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America&quot;.

==Education and early career==
Emerson received a Bachelor of Arts from Brown University in 1976, and a Master of Arts in sociology in 1977. He went to Washington, D.C., in 1977 with the intention of putting off his law school studies for a year. He worked on staff as an investigator for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee until 1982, and as an executive assistant to Democratic Senator Frank Church of Idaho.

==Journalist and commentator==
Emerson was a freelance writer for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, for whom he wrote a series of articles in 1982 on the influence of Saudi Arabia on U.S. corporations, law firms, public-relations outfits, and educational institutions. In their pursuit of large contracts with Saudi Arabia, he argued, U.S. businesses became unofficial, unregistered lobbyists for Saudi interests. He expanded this material in 1985 in his first book, &quot;The American House of Saud: The Secret Petrodollar Connection&quot;.

===&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and CNN===
From 1986 to 1989 he worked for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as a senior editor specializing in national security issues. In 1988, he published &quot;Secret Warriors: Inside the Covert Military Operations of the Reagan Era&quot;, a strongly critical review of Ronald Reagan-era efforts to strengthen U.S. covert capabilities. Reviewing the book, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Among the grace notes of Mr. Emerson&#x27;s fine book are many small, well-told stories&quot;.
In 1990, he co-authored &quot;The Fall of Pan Am 103: Inside the Lockerbie Investigation&quot;, which argued for the then-mainstream theory that Iran was behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Reviewing the book, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Emerson and Mr. Duffy have put together a surpassing account of the investigation to date, rich with drama and studded with the sort of anecdotal details that give the story the appearance of depth and weight.&quot; The newspaper listed it as an &quot;editors&#x27; choice&quot; on their Best Sellers List, and cited it as a &quot;notable book of the year&quot;.

In 1990, he joined CNN as an investigative correspondent and continued to write about terrorism. In 1991, he published &quot;Terrorist: The Inside Story of the Highest-Ranking Iraqi Terrorist Ever to Defect to the West&quot;, detailing how Iraq spread and increased its terror network in the 1980s with U.S. support.

===&quot;Jihad in America&quot;===
Emerson left CNN in 1993 to work on a documentary, &quot;Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America&quot;, for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). It aired as &quot;a PBS special&quot; in November 1994.

In the documentary, he warned of future Islamic terrorist attacks in the United States. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) noted that PBS denied requests by Arab and Muslim journalists to screen the program before its showing, and argued that Emerson was promoting &quot;a wild theory about an Islamic terrorist network in America&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Walter Goodman opined that the request to change or cancel the documentary was not justified, but that the concerns about Emerson&#x27;s claims of an Islamic terrorist network were justified &quot;since &#x27;Jihad in America&#x27; is likely to awaken viewers&#x27; unease over what some Muslim groups here may be up to.&quot;

He received the 1994 George Polk Award for &quot;Best Television Documentary.&quot; He also received the top prize for best investigative report from the Investigative Reporters and Editors Organization (IRE).

A review of the book by &quot;The New York Times&#x27;s &quot; Ethan Bronner, says that conservatives and some Jewish organizations took Emerson seriously, but that others have dismissed him as &quot;an obsessive crusader&quot;, and concludes that while Emerson sometimes connects unrelated dots, occasionally he can be wrong; but that as an investigator focusing on radical Islamic groups in the US, his information should be taken seriously but not just at face value.

===Commentary===
Emerson has made false claims about Muslims in the US and Europe; in particular, some of his claims during a Fox News segment about the relationship between British Muslims and the city of Birmingham were subsequently rebuked by the then British Prime Minister David Cameron and led to a censure of Fox News by Ofcom for the airing of the comments which the broadcasting regulator characterized as &quot;materially misleading&quot; and &quot;a serious breach for a current affairs programme&quot;.

It was Emerson&#x27;s 1994 documentary &quot;Jihad in America&quot; that first linked Sami Al-Arian to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). When in February 2003 the U.S. indicted Al-Arian, accusing him of being the North American leader of PIJ and financing and helping support suicide bombings, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Emerson &quot;has complained about Mr. Al-Arian&#x27;s activities in the United States for nearly a decade.&quot; In 2006, Al-Arian pleaded guilty to conspiracy to help a &quot;specially designated terrorist&quot; organization, PIJ, and was sentenced to 57 months in prison, after a jury deadlocked on 9 charges (8 of which the government agreed to drop as part of the plea bargain) and acquitted him on another 8. Al-Arian said that he knew of the terrorist group&#x27;s violent acts, though no evidence was admitted at trial showing that he was involved with violent acts.

In 1995 CBS interviews, prior to any knowledge the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building was perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh, Emerson said &quot;Oklahoma City, I can tell you, is probably considered one of the largest centers of Islamic radical activity outside the Middle East&quot;, and that the bombing &quot;was done with the intent to inflict as many casualties as possible. That is a Middle Eastern trait, and something that has been generally not carried out on this soil until we were rudely awakened to it in 1993&quot;. He also told viewers not to believe Islamic groups&#x27; denials of their involvement. Emerson has said some critics fail to recite the rest of his statement that references the 1993 World Trade Center attack which was also carried out with a fertilizer truck bomb. Emerson indicated that he was one of many experts interviewed after the bombing who concluded there were similarities between the Oklahoma City bombing and Middle Eastern terrorism. He said the initial reporting did not &quot;tar the entire Muslim community&quot;, that he referred only to a fanatical minority in the Islamic community. He acknowledged there were outbreaks of harassment which he referred to as unfortunate. In response to claims that all Muslims were blamed Emerson said &quot;the charge of racism against Muslims is a canard designed to justify radical Islamic activities in this country.&quot; He supported the media&#x27;s decision to report the possible link to Middle East terrorism, saying &quot;There was no doubt&quot; that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies suspected it.

In testimony on March 19, 1996, to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Emerson described the Holy Land Foundation as &quot;the main fund-raising arm for Hamas in the United States.&quot; In 2007, federal prosecutors brought charges against Holy Land for funding Hamas and other Islamic terrorist organizations. In 2009, the founders of Holy Land were given life sentences for &quot;funneling $12 million to Hamas.&quot;

In January 2001 it was reported that Emerson pointed out that the U.S. had missed clues that would have allowed it to focus on al-Qaeda early on. One of the men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing, Ahmad Ajaj, returned to the U.S. from Pakistan in 1992 with a bomb manual later seized by the U.S. An English translation of the document, entered into evidence in the World Trade Center trial, said that the manual was dated 1982, that it had been published in Amman, Jordan, and that it carried a heading on the front and succeeding pages: &quot;The Basic Rule&quot;. But those were all errors, as Emerson pointed out. The heading said &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; – which translates as &quot;The Base&quot;. In addition, the document was published in 1989, a year after al-Qaeda was founded, and the place of publication was Afghanistan, not Jordan.

== Investigative Project on Terrorism ==

The Investigative Project on Terrorism was founded by Emerson in 1995, shortly after the release of his documentary film, &quot;Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America&quot;, which first aired in the United States in 1994 on PBS. The documentary was faulted for misrepresentation, and Robert Friedman accused Emerson of &quot;creating mass hysteria against American Arabs.&quot; The think-tank, Center for American Progress (CAP), stated that the IPT was one of ten foundations constituting what it called &quot;the Islamophobia network in America&quot;.

==Reception==
In 1988, Emerson was referred to by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an expert on intelligence&quot;, and in 2015 as a &quot;self-described terrorism expert&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; referred to prior to 1989 as &quot;the nation&#x27;s foremost journalistic expert on terrorism&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to Emerson as a terrorism expert, and as a Fox News commentator. He has also been regarded as a part of the counter-jihad movement. Some have called Emerson an Islamophobe.

Richard Clarke, former head of counter-terrorism for the United States National Security Council, said of Emerson, &quot;I think of Steve as the Paul Revere of terrorism ... We&#x27;d always learn things [from him] we weren’t hearing from the FBI or CIA, things which almost always proved to be true.&quot;

Philip Jenkins, in his 2003 book, &quot;Images of terror: what we can and can&#x27;t know about terrorism&quot; responded that certain groups criticize Emerson in order to silence and delegitimize his views.

Stephen Suleyman Schwartz wrote an article defending Emerson that attempted to explain why Islamists dislike him.

A review by Michael Wines in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of &quot;The Fall of Pan Am 103,&quot; while noting that the authors were &quot;respected journalists&quot; and &quot;not to be lightly dismissed,&quot; and that they &quot;talked to 250 people, including senior law enforcement and intelligence officials in seven nations&quot;, opined that charges of Iranian complicity were presented &quot;without much substantiation&quot; although Wines did go on to say that: &quot;They build a convincing circumstantial case against Iran and its terrorist agents.&quot;

Adrienne Edgar, writing in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; described Emerson and Cristina del Sesto&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;Terrorist&quot;, as &quot;marred by factual errors (such as mistranslations of Arabic names) and marked by &quot;a pervasive anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias.&quot; Emerson and del Sesto responded: &quot;We defy anyone to point to any passages that suggest such bias... these characterizations of the book are wild figments of Ms. Edgar&#x27;s political imagination.&quot;

In their report &quot;Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the Islamophobia Network in America&quot;, the Center for American Progress accused Emerson of being an &quot;misinformation expert&quot; who, through his testimonies, exaggerates the presence of Sharia law in America and terrorism sympathizers in mosques.

Emerson has been criticized for espousing Islamophobic views by Islamic studies scholars such as Juliane Hamer and Omid Safi, with German media scholar Kai Hafez, and Carl Ernst naming Emerson along with Daniel Pipes as the two most prominent Islamophobic voices in the US. Emerson responded to these and similar characterizations in an op-ed for Fox News, stating that criticism of Islam labeled as Islamphophia, and the labeling of &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; as a racist generalization of Muslims, is &quot;one of the biggest and most dangerous national security frauds of the past 30 years.&quot;

Emerson&#x27;s work was cited as an instance of poor reporting on Islam in the Sut Jhally film about Edward Said&#x27;s &quot;Orientalism&quot;, specifically his claim after the Oklahoma City bombing that the municipality was a center of Muslim extremism.

==Controversies==

===Sami al-Arian case===
Emerson has played a role in criminal prosecutions. In the widely criticized Sami Al-Arian case he was a major source of information and advice to the federal prosecutors and the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot;. He has a close relationship to Gordon Kromberg, a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia. The Holy Land Foundation prosecution relied on evidence produced by Emerson&#x27;s Investigative Project.

===Boston Marathon bombing===
On April 17, 2013, Emerson stated on the Fox News program &quot;Hannity&quot; that he had been informed by an official in the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that a Saudi national who was present during the Boston Marathon bombing was suspected of playing a role in the bombing. Emerson wondered why a suspect would be deported and not prosecuted. Emerson reasoned that United States handles Saudi nationals differently to appease Saudi Arabia and not to embarrass the country. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, whose department supervises the ICE, dismissed Emerson&#x27;s allegation during a meeting with the House Homeland Security Committee, as being incorrect. United States officials stated that the injured Saudi national was regarded as a witness and not a suspect. A Saudi official at the embassy also stated that there was no known suspect or person of interest that they were aware of. On April 19, 2013, Steve Emerson was featured in an opinion piece on Fox News and referred to the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, YouTube channels as being similar in tone to Al Qaeda videos. Many local, state and federal officials, including President Barack Obama, cautioned against jumping to conclusions while there&#x27;s an ongoing investigation.

===Comments on Fox News about Birmingham and Paris===
In January 2015, following terrorist attacks in Paris, Emerson stated in an interview on Fox News that the city of Birmingham was populated entirely by Muslims and was a &quot;no go area&quot; for non-Muslims. According to an estimate from the UK Census of 2011, Birmingham is estimated to have 21.8% of its population identify as Muslim, with a Christian population of 46%, and 25% claiming no religion or not giving a religion. In the same interview, he claimed that in London, &quot;Muslim religious police &#x27;beat&#x27; anyone who doesn&#x27;t dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire&quot;. The errors led to four apologies within 12 hours by Fox News. The UK media regulatory authority Ofcom found Fox News to be in breach of the UK&#x27;s broadcasting code on account of the comments. Ofcom described the comments as &quot;materially misleading&quot; and &quot;a serious breach&quot;.

In response to these comments, British Prime Minister David Cameron said that he &quot;choked on his porridge&quot; when he heard them and observed that Emerson was &quot;clearly a complete idiot&quot;. Local MP Gisela Stuart described Emerson&#x27;s remarks as &quot;stupid&quot; and that they had &quot;no redeeming features&quot;. Emerson&#x27;s remarks, which &quot;embarrassed&quot; Fox, extended to other countries, especially regarding supposed exclusion zones in Paris. Thousands of people ridiculed Emerson&#x27;s comments on social media using the hashtag #FoxNewsFacts.

Emerson issued an apology for his misinformation stating, &quot;I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error.&quot; He further added that he would make a donation to a charity in Birmingham and also place a newspaper ad in Birmingham. It was also reported that Birmingham City Council welcomed his apology, describing Emerson&#x27;s comments as &quot;curious&quot; and clearly without foundation. Sir Albert Bore, the leader of the council mocked Emerson writing &quot;As I arrived for work at the Council House this morning I was full of awe and admiration for the many commuters who braved the &#x27;no-go area&#x27; that is now Birmingham city centre&quot; and described Emerson&#x27;s remarks as &quot;stupid, untrue and damaging...ridiculous&quot;.

=== Involvement in spying on American Muslim organizations ===
Emerson has recently been accused of spying on two different American Muslim organizations. On December 14, 2021, CAIR&#x27;s Ohio chapter fired an executive who confessed to acting as a &quot;mole&quot; and passing confidential information to for Steven Emerson&#x27;s organization IPT. Shortly thereafter, another mole operating at a different Muslim organization came forward to CAIR and admitted to being paid $3,000 by Steven Emerson every month for recording discussions with prominent American Muslim leaders, amounting to a total of $100,000 over the course of four years.

<doc id="1183070" wikidata="Q686514" url="?curid=1183070" title="Derrick">
<text>A derrick is a lifting device composed at minimum of one guyed mast, as in a gin pole, which may be articulated over a load by adjusting its guys. Most derricks have at least two components, either a guyed mast or self-supporting tower, and a boom hinged at its base to provide articulation, as in a stiffleg derrick. The most basic type of derrick is controlled by three or four lines connected to the top of the mast, which allow it to both move laterally and cant up and down. To lift a load, a separate line runs up and over the mast with a hook on its free end, as with a crane.

Derricks are especially useful for high-rise rigging, jobs that cover a long period of time, or jobs when the impact to street or pedestrian traffic is a concern. Forms of derricks are commonly found aboard ships and at docking facilities. Large derricks mounted on dedicated vessels are known as floating derricks and shearlegs.

The term derrick is also applied to the framework supporting a drilling apparatus in an oil rig. The derrick derives its name from a type of gallows named after Thomas Derrick, an Elizabethan era English executioner.

== Types ==
There are various types of derrick based on how the tower or mast is set up and the use of boom.

=== A-frame ===

An A-frame derrick is one in which the boom is hinged from a cross member between the bottom ends of two upright members spread apart at the lower ends and joined at the top; the boom point secured to the junction of the side members, and the side members are braced or guyed from this junction point.

=== Basket ===

A basket derrick is a derrick without a boom that is supported by a rope-and-pole system that forms a basket. The basket is constructed from a group of poles to form a polygon. There are crossbars between the pole members to strengthen their support. The supporting ropes are tied to the top of the basket poles on one end and joined together on the other end at a lower elevation than the top of the basket poles to form the base for the derrick tower. The derrick tower can be a mast or a post with the bottom hinged at the base where all ropes meet. The top of the tower is secured with multiple reeved guys to position the top of the tower to the desired location by varying the length of the upper guy lines. The load is lifted using a pulley system connected to the top of the tower.

=== Breast ===

A breast derrick is a derrick without a boom and with a mast constructed from two upright members. The upright members are more spread at their bottom ends than their top ends. There are crossbars to join the two members from the bottom to the top to form a mast.

=== Chicago boom ===

A Chicago boom derrick is a derrick with a boom which is attached to an external structure. The external upright member of the structure serves as the mast, and the boom is stepped in a fixed socket clamped to the upright. The boom is connected to at least three pulley systems to control the position of the boom. For example, a pulley system is connected to the top of the boom and the higher area of the external structure and two pulley systems near the top of the boom connected on either side of the boom to the external structure. The position of the top of the boom can be controlled by manipulating these pulley systems. The load is lifted from a separate pulley system that is connected to the top of the boom.

=== Gin pole ===

A gin pole derrick (also known as standing derrick or pole derrick) is a derrick without a boom and with single tower or mast supported by four guy wires (two side guys, a fore guy and a rear guy). Its guys are so arranged from its top as to permit leaning the mast in any direction. The base of the tower is hinged and the top of the tower is connected to a pulley system for load lifting. As this is a simple derrick system, it is recommended for use by some agencies as an improvised rescue derrick in an emergency situation where no suitable rescue derrick or crane is available.

=== Guy ===
A guy derrick (also known as boom derrick) is a fixed guyed mast derrick that can be rotated and connected to a boom. The mast is in upright position with the base that can make the mast rotate, but not lean in any direction. The top of the mast is connected to many guy wires which are anchored to the ground to support the load. At the base, the mast is also connect to the bottom end of the boom. The boom extends outward and upward to the desired position. The top of the boom is a pulley system that is connected to the top of the mast to control how far the boom is to be from the mast. When the mast is rotated, the connected boom is swung from to the side. The control of the lifting location is done by the manipulation of the top pulley system and the rotation of the mast at the base. The load is lifted by another pulley system connected to the top of the boom. In a medium load lifting, another construction method can be used. In this case, the mast is fixed without being rotated, but the boom can be swung around the mast. This can be done by connecting the bottom of the boom with two boards on the opposite sides around the surface of the boom to form a fork. The fork and the bottom part of the boom are lashed to secure them together. Another lashing between the fork area and the mast at a higher position supports the weight of the boom. The fork is put around the mast such that the bottom of the boom rests on the mast without being permanently fixed to it. The fork prevents the boom from coming off the mast while it swings up to 180 degrees.

=== Shearleg ===
A shearleg derrick is similar to a breast derrick with the exception that, instead of fixed guy wires that secure the top of the mast, it is secured by multiple reeved guys to permit handling loads at various radii by means of load tackle pulley system suspended from the mast top. In a simpler construction, a shearleg derrick can be assembled from two posts to form A-frame shear legs without any crossbar. The bottom of the legs are set in two holes on the ground, spreading them apart. There is a rope to tie the two legs together near the bottom to prevent them from spreading apart further. On the top side, the two legs are connected together by a lashing but with a small spacer block placed between the legs. A sling, which may be made from ropes, is placed around the area that two legs meet to be used to put a tackle pulley system for lifting the load. There are two guy wires, front and rear, to support the shear legs. The rear guy may be reeved to allow adjustment of the angle of the shear legs.

=== Stiffleg ===
A stiffleg derrick, also known as a Scotch derrick, is a derrick with a boom similar to that of a guy derrick, but instead of using guy wires to secure the top of the mast, it uses two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of resisting either tensile or compressive forces. Sills may also be used to connect between the bottom ends of the stifflegs and the base of the mast. There may be a counterweight to place on the sills behind the stifflegs in heavy load lifting. A stiffleg derrick on a vessel is called a floating stiffleg derrick.

== Oil derrick ==

Another kind of derrick is used on oil wells and other drilled holes. Both the structure itself and the complex set of machines associated with it are referred to as a derrick. A derrick is also used on some offshore oil and gas rigs.

== Patent systems ==
===Hallen===
The boom is connected with the lower part of the mast which is shaped like a &quot;Y&quot; or a bipod and therefore it is a single swinging derrick. On the cross trees, two guys are fastened using swivel outriggers which are stayed vertically and horizontally. In order to maintain a good controlling angle between guys and derrick, the outriggers cannot pass the inboard parallel of the centerline. The right outrigger stays in the centerline while the left outrigger moves outboard. This derrick will lower or heave cargo as both guys are veered or hauled. Three winches, controlled by joystick, are necessary to operate the Hallen derrick: two for the guys and one for the purchase. Limit switches are used to avoid an over-topping or over-swinging. However, the limits can be modified if a different working range or a special vertical stowage is required. The safe working load of the Hallen is between 10 and 80 tonnes. In a Hallen Universal derrick, which has no Hallen D-Frame, the halyard has an extended length since it runs through further blocks on the centerline. The Universal Hallen derrick, replacing the D-Frame option, is a kind of traditional topping lift. The Hallen D-Frame is a steel bracket welded on the mast in the centerline. For an observer standing a beam, the frame has a &quot;D&quot;-shape. The D-Frame supersedes the outriggers and provides a good controlling angle on the guys. The Hallen derrick is appropriate for, e.g., containers, logs, steel rail, sawn timber and heavy lifts. It does not lend itself to small, general cargo. It keeps the deck clear of guy ropes and preventors. Only one winchman is needed, and the Hallen can be brought into use within a few minutes. It is less expensive than a crane. A disadvantage is the low working range of the Hallen derrick; it is able to swing 75° from the centerline and can work against a list of up to 15°.

===Velle===
The Velle derrick is similar to the Hallen but without the use of outriggers. On top of the boom is a T-shaped yoke. As in the Hallen, the guys serve for topping and lowering the boom, but they are fastened on the yoke with four short, steel-wire hanger ropes. The ends of the topping and lowering ends of the halyard are secured to half-barrels on one winch. In this way the boom moves at the same speed as the winch veers the topping end of the halyard and hauls the lowering end of the halyard, and vice versa. The slewing ends are also wound on to another half-barrel. There is a third winch to hoist to cargo on the yoke. Runners decrease swing and rotation of the cargo. A joystick duplex controller steers the Velle derrick.

=== Stülcken ===

The Stülcken derrick is used for heavy cargo. It stems from the German shipyard HC Stülcken &amp; Sohn, later taken over by neighboring yard Blohm &amp; Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes (faster than a traditional heavy derrick), does not require much space, and is operated by four winches. The Stülcken is secured between two V-shaped, unstayed Samson-posts. This makes it possible to let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. Each post has a hoisting winch, a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored to the base of the boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured, which reduces the safe working load by half. After the union table is detached, the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through, which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick can reach a vertical position. A bullrope pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over, so that the span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. In this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over, gravity is used again.

==Change of era==
* 1321 : The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Gen&#x27;ō&quot; 3. The era name is derived from the &quot;I Ching&quot;; it should not be confused with the later Genkō (1331–1334), which used a different character for (弘, &quot;wide&quot;, instead of 亨, &quot;go smoothly.&quot;)

* July 16, 1324 (&quot;Genkō 4, 25th day of the 6th month&quot;): Former Emperor Go-Uda&#x27;s death.

The oldest extant account of Buddhism in Japan, the &quot;Genkō Shakusho&quot; (元亨釈書), was completed in &quot;Genkō&quot; 2, whence the era name in its title. The massive project was the work of Kokan Shiren.

<text>Gerhard Küntscher (6 December 1900 – ) was a German surgeon who inaugurated the intramedullary nailing of long bone fractures.

==Biography==
Küntscher was born in Zwickau, Germany.

Küntscher invented what is known as the Küntscher nail, an internal fixation device used to maintain the position of the fracture fragments during healing. The nail is rigid and has a cloverleaf shape in cross-section.

Küntscher first performed the process using the nail in November 1939 at the University Department of Surgery in Kiel. He first presented 12 cases of intramedullary fixation with rods at a surgical meeting in Berlin 03/18/40 and was met with general disapproval for using surgery for fractures The German military initially disapproved of Kuntscher&#x27;s IM nailing technique but introduced it in 1942.

While in the Finnish Lapland from 1942 to 1944, Küntscher taught Finnish surgeons to do intramedullary nailings, which earned him recognition and respect in the orthopedic community. The war also prevented the knowledge of Küntscher&#x27;s use of the IM nail to exit Germany. The German military had the upper hand in treating soldiers with the IM nail and having them return to fighting status in just a few weeks. 
Worldwide knowledge was not established until the prisoners of war (POW&#x27;s) returned to their home countries carrying Küntscher&#x27;s legacy in the form of steel nails in their legs. Returned POW&#x27;s included airmen who had parachuted and broken femurs on landing. Künstscher had been reassigned to a Luftwaffe hospital outside of Berlin and Luftwaffe POW&#x27;s were treated there. All previous treatment of femur fractures required 6 weeks of bed rest and Allied doctors debriefing the returnees were astonished that they were up and walking in days after surgery.

A. W. Fischer, head of Küntscher&#x27;s department, said in 1944 about his invention: &quot;This practical treatment of fractures using a nail, the Küntscher procedure, is, in my eyes, the greatest revolution in the treatment of bone fractures since the invention of nail extension by Klapp, and this revolution will conquer the world.&quot;

==Change of era==
* 1319 : The new era name was created to mark the accession of Emperor Go-Daigo and the beginning of his reign. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Bunpō&quot; 3. The era name was taken from the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;.

==Events of the &quot;Gen&#x27;ō&quot; era==
After the abdication of Emperor Hanazono in &quot;Bunpō&quot; 2, Takaharu-shinno was proclaimed emperor at the age of 31. Nijō Michihira was &quot;kampaku&quot; (chancellor); but the court remained under the direction of former-Emperor Go-Uda. Prince Morikuni was the shōgun in Kamakura; and the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sagami, Hōjō Takatoki, was &quot;shikken&quot; or chief minister of the shogunate.

* 1319 (&quot;Gen&#x27;ō 1, 12th month&quot;): Nijō Michihira was obliged to resign his position as &quot;kampaku&quot; because of pressure from the bakufu in Kamakura; and Ichijō Uchitsune became &quot;kampaku&quot; instead.

* 1320 (&quot;Gen&#x27;ō 2, 5th month&quot;): The former regent, Kujō Moronori died at age 48.

<doc id="1183084" wikidata="Q1173438" url="?curid=1183084" title="Davey Street">
<text>Davey Street is a major one way street passing through the outskirts of the Hobart central business district in Tasmania, Australia. Davey street is named after Thomas Davey, the first Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The street forms a one-way couplet with nearby Macquarie Street connecting traffic from the Southern Outlet in the south with traffic from the Tasman Highway to the east and the Brooker Highway to the north of the city. With annual average daily traffic of 37,200 in 2007, it is one of the busier streets in Hobart.

Davey Street is featured as a property in the Australian version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

==History==
Historically the Sullivans Cove area of Davey Street was a significantly quieter stretch of road, greatly utilised by shipping activities as part of the former Wapping district. Throughout the 1800s, Several smaller factory buildings facing Davey Street were operated by the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company and merchants AG Webster &amp; Son. 

The Hobart Electric Tram Company utilised land with Campbell Street and Davey Street frontage for their tram depot workshop, commencing 1893. The depot then housed the city&#x27;s trolleybuses from 1935 and from 1955 operated as the original headquarters for Metro Tasmania. The main section of the tram terminus was located directly opposite on Macquarie Street and its original offices, store and entrance arches all remain, with the latter being incorporated into newly built structures.

In 1938, a General Motors dealership called Nettlefolds was constructed along Hunter Street, intersecting with Davey Street. The dealership contained a large Art Deco commercial building containing a corner tower and neon signage. The site housed a General Motors showroom, bodyworks and service centre specialising in Vauxhall and Bedford trucks.

On 15 August 1977 it was converted to a one way street. Prior to the construction of the Hotel Grand Chancellor in the 1980s, Davey Street commenced at Hunter Street. Part of the Sheraton masterplan saw Davey Street extended and connected with the newly created Brooker Highway (formally Lower Park Street). This route alteration completely changed the way transit operated in the city, with Davey Street now functioning as one of the city&#x27;s central transit thoroughfares.

==Route==

Davey street commences close to the historic Royal Engineers Building at an intersection with the Tasman Highway, the Brooker Highway and Macquarie Street. It is four-lane for almost all of its length, providing access to Salamanca, Sandy Bay and the Southern Outlet to Kingston and Huonville.

Sections of Davey Street&#x27;s alignment are on reclaimed land on the edge of Constitution Dock and Victoria Dock at Sullivan&#x27;s Cove. It borders two of the city&#x27;s largest urban parks; Franklin Square and St David&#x27;s Park.

Prominent buildings in the street include the Tasmanian Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Hobart City Council Centre, the Executive Building (which houses the Department of Premier &amp; Cabinet), the Hotel Grand Chancellor, Federation Concert Hall, the Hobart Real Tennis Club, and the former Davey Street Telstra exchange (now apartments).

==Proposed bypass==
The current one-way couplet system between Macquarie Street and Davey Street was first proposed with the publication of the Hobart Area Transportation Study in 1965. At the time the couplet system was intended to be a stop gap measure before the then proposed Northside Freeway could be completed. However the proposed freeway was seen as controversial and abandoned. Since the completion of the couplet in 1987, there has been no alternative route between the Southern outlet and the other major arterial roads in Hobart.
There has since been several design proposals for a tunnel under the city ranging from cut and cover proposals under Davey/Macquarie Streets to large scale bored tunnels running from the Southern Outlet through to the Tasman Bridge.

<text>or Medieval Showa was a after &quot;Ōchō&quot; and before &quot;Bunpō.&quot; This period spanned the years from March 1312 through February 1317. The reigning emperor was .

==Etymology==
The era name is derived from the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, a Classical Chinese work composed in AD 941–945. The first character is &quot;shō&quot; (正), meaning &quot;proper, straight, true&quot;, while 和 (&quot;wa&quot;) means &quot;peace,&quot; and may also pun on &quot;Wa&quot; (倭), an ancient name for Japan. The era name is pronounced like the Shōwa era of 1926–1989, but that era name is written with the character 昭 (&quot;illustrious&quot;) for &quot;shō&quot;.

==Change of era==
* 1311 : The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Ōchō&quot; 2.

==Events of the &quot;Shōwa&quot; era==
Initially, former-Emperor Fushimi administered the court up through the time he took the tonsure as a Buddhist monk.
* 1313 (&quot;Shōwa 2, 10th month&quot;): Retired Emperor Fushimi shaved his head and became a Buddhist monk; and the power to administer the court of reigning Emperor Hanazono shifted to his adopted son, former-Emperor Go-Fushimi.
* 1314 (&quot;Shōwa 3, 11th month&quot;): Hōjō Sadaaki ended his role at Rokuhara Tandai in Kyoto; and he returned to Kamakura.
* 1315 (&quot;Shōwa 4, 7th month&quot;): Hōjō Hirotoki dies in Kamakura; and initially, Hōjō Sadaaki and Hōjō Mototoki share power.
* 1315 (&quot;Shōwa 4, 10th month&quot;): Hōjō Tokiatsu assumes the role of Rokuhara Tandai in the capital city.
* 1316 (&quot;Shōwa 5, 7th month&quot;): Hōjō Tokiatsu, who is the son of Hōjō Sadaaki, takes on the role of Shikken; and Hōjō Mototoki retires to a Buddhist monastery where he shaves his head.

<text>A gord is a medieval Slavonic fortified settlement, usually built on strategic sites such as hilltops, riverbanks, lake islets or peninsulas between the 6th and 12th centuries in Central and Eastern Europe. A typical gord consisted of a group of wooden houses surrounded by a wall made of earth and wood, and a palisade running along the top of the bulwark.

== Etymology ==

The term ultimately descends from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot; &#x27;enclosure&#x27;. The Proto-Slavic word &quot;*gordъ&quot; later differentiated into grad (Cyrillic: град), gorod (Cyrillic: город), gród in Polish, gard in Kashubian, etc. It is the root of various words in modern Slavic languages pertaining to fences and fenced-in areas (Belarusian гарадзіць, Ukrainian городити, Slovak ohradiť, Czech ohradit, Russian оградить, Serbo-Croatian ograditi, and Polish ogradzać, grodzić, to fence off). It also has evolved into words for a garden in certain languages.

Additionally, it has furnished numerous modern Slavic words for a city or town:

*Polish &quot;gród&quot;, plural &quot;grody&quot; (toponymic; nowadays a town or city is termed &quot;miasto&quot;, but remnants of a &quot;gród&quot; are known as &quot;grodzisko&quot;)
*Ancient Pomeranian and modern Kashubian &quot;gard&quot;
*Slovak and Czech &quot;hrad&quot; (&quot;castle&quot; in the modern language), or &quot;hradisko/hradiště/hradec&quot;, which are terms for gord
*Slovene &quot;gradec&quot;, &quot;grad&quot; (&quot;castle&quot; in modern Slovene)
*Belarusian (horad)
*Russian (gorod)
*Ukrainian (&quot;horod&quot;, dialectal and toponymic; nowadays &quot;misto&quot;)
*Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, and Macedonian &quot;grad&quot;/

The names of many Central and Eastern European cities harken back to their pasts as gords. Some of them are in countries which once were but no longer are mainly inhabited by Slavic-speaking peoples.

Examples include:
* Horodok
* Gorod (toponymy)
* Hrod (toponymy)
* Hrud
* Horod
* Hrad (toponymy)
* Gard (Slavic toponymy)
* Grod (toponymy)
* Grad (toponymy)

The words in Polish and Slovak for &quot;suburbium&quot;, &quot;podgrodzie&quot; and &quot;podhradie&quot; correspondingly, literally mean a settlement beneath a gord: the &quot;gród&quot;/&quot;hrad&quot; was frequently built at the top of a hill, and the &quot;podgrodzie&quot;/&quot;podhradie&quot; at its foot. (The Slavic prefix &quot;pod-&quot;, meaning &quot;under/below&quot; and descending from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;,&quot; meaning foot, being equivalent to Latin &quot;sub-&quot;). The word survives in the names of several villages (Podgrodzie, Subcarpathian Voivodeship) and town districts (e.g., that of Olsztyn), as well as in the names of the German municipalities Puttgarden, Wagria and Putgarten, Rügen.

From this same Proto-Indo-European root come the Germanic word elements *&quot;gard&quot; and *&quot;gart&quot; (as in Stuttgart), and likely also the names of Graz, Austria and Gartz, Germany. Cognate to these are English words such as &quot;garden&quot;, &quot;yard&quot;, &quot;garth&quot;, &quot;girdle&quot; and &quot;court.&quot; Also cognate but less closely related are Latin &quot;hortus&quot;, a garden, and its English descendant &quot;horticulture&quot;. In Hungarian, &quot;kert&quot;, the word for a garden, literally means &quot;encircled&quot;. Because Hungarian is a Uralic rather than an Indo-European language, this is likely a loanword. Further afield, in ancient Iran, a fortified wooden settlement was called a &quot;gerd&quot;, or &quot;certa&quot;, which also means garden (as in the suffix &quot;-certa&quot; in the names of various ancient Iranian cities; e.g., &quot;Hunoracerta&quot;). The Persian word evolved into &quot;jerd&quot; under later Arab influence. Burugerd or Borujerd is a city in the west of Iran. The Indian suffix &quot;-garh&quot;, meaning a fort in Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, and other Indo-Iranian languages, appears in many Indian place names. Given that both Slavic and Indo-Iranian are sub-branches of Indo-European and that there are numerous similarities between Slavic and Sanskrit vocabulary, it is plausible that &quot;garh&quot; and &quot;gord&quot; are related. However, this is strongly contradicted by the phoneme /g/ in Indo-Iranian, which cannot be a reflex of the Indo-European palatovelar /*ǵ/.

== Construction ==

A typical gord was a group of wooden houses built either in rows or in circles, surrounded by one or more rings of walls made of earth and wood, a palisade, and/or moats. Some gords were ring-shaped, with a round, oval, or occasionally polygonal fence or wall surrounding a hollow. Others, built on a natural hill or a man-made mound, were cone-shaped. Those with a natural defense on one side, such as a river or lake, were usually horseshoe-shaped. Most gords were built in densely populated areas on sites that offered particular natural advantages.

As Slavic tribes united to form states, gords were also built for defensive purposes in less-populated border areas. Gords in which rulers resided or that lay on trade routes quickly expanded. Near the gord, or below it in elevation, there formed small communities of servants, merchants, artisans, and others who served the higher-ranked inhabitants of the gord. Each such community was known as a &quot;suburbium&quot; (literally &quot;undercity&quot;) (). Its residents could shelter within the walls of the gord in the event of danger. Eventually the &quot;suburbium&quot; acquired its own fence or wall. In the High Middle Ages, the gord usually evolved into a castle, citadel or kremlin, and the &quot;suburbium&quot; into a town.

Some gords did not stand the test of time and were abandoned or destroyed, gradually turning into more or less discernible mounds or rings of earth (Russian &quot;gorodishche,&quot; Polish &quot;gród&quot; or &quot;grodzisko,&quot; Ukrainian &quot;horodyshche,&quot; Slovak &quot;hradisko,&quot; Czech &quot;hradiště,&quot; German &quot;Hradisch&quot;, Hungarian &quot;hradis&quot; and Serbian &quot;gradiška&quot;/&quot;градишка&quot;). Notable archeological sites include Groß Raden in Germany and Biskupin in Poland.

<text>Vocal percussion is the art of creating sounds with one&#x27;s mouth that approximate, imitate, or otherwise serve the same purpose as a percussion instrument, whether in a group of singers, an instrumental ensemble, or solo.

== In Western music ==
Recent musicological research points at Brazilian songwriter and musician Marcos Valle as a pioneer of vocal percussion. In the track &quot;Mentira&quot; from his 1973 album &quot;Previsão do Tempo&quot;, Valle imitates a drum kit with his voice.

Beatboxing, an art form pioneered by rapper Doug E. Fresh, is one school of vocal percussion, originating in hip-hop music and often used to accompany rapping. Stylistically, it is more expansive than traditional vocal percussion as it involves mimicking other sound effects and instruments with the voice such as trumpets, scratches, and bass-lines. It is utilized by many musicians spanning over a wide variety of genres.

Vocal percussion is also an integral part of many world music traditions, most notably in the traditions of North India (bols) and South India (solkattu). Syllables are used to learn percussion compositions, and each syllable signifies what stroke or combination of strokes the percussionist must use.

The art of speaking these syllables is called konnakol in South India, and traditional dance ensembles sometimes have a dedicated konnakol singer, although this practice is now waning. At one time it was a very respected art form, with many masters and singers.

In North India, the practice of reciting bols is usually limited to the percussionist reciting the composition about to be played, often in the context of a longer solo. These recitations are also sometimes spoken by a Kathak dancer.

== Mouth drumming ==
Mouth drumming is a form of Beatboxing which involves vocally imitating the sound of a drum kit as precisely as possible in order to use the voice to serve the same function as a drummer in a musical setting. It is mostly used in a cappella music but has also been used in rock and jazz. Artists who specialize in this technique are simply referred to as vocal percussionists.

===History===
Wes Carroll is credited as the term coiner and pioneering practitioner of this art. Well-known for his ability to realistically vocalize the sounds of a drum kit, and use them as the primary rhythm section in bands and a cappella groups, he inspired many vocalists and musicians to continue this art form after him. Jeff Thacher and Dave Baumgartner are other well-known pioneers.

===In a cappella===
Many a cappella groups use mouth drumming as a way of using the voice to provide a steady rhythm section for their music.

A cappella groups such as Five o-clock Shadow, The House Jacks, Rockapella, Overboard, SoVoSo, Transit and Naturally 7 are well known for further advancing the art and its popularity.

===In rock and jazz music===
Although it is not common, mouth drumming has also been used in traditional band settings. David Worm (who has also performed it for the a cappella group SoVoSo) has often incorporated the technique in his acoustic rock band &quot;Glass house&quot;. 
Kaichiro Kitamura is a Japanese vocal percussionist specializing in this art who has incorporated it in both a cappella and jazz groups. Otha Major is another vocal percussionist and beatboxer, who has often used the technique in rock performances as well as with the a cappella group Kickshaw.

==Change of era==
* 1308, also called : The new era name was created to mark the accession of Emperor Hanazono. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Tokuji&quot; 3. The era name is derived from the Book of the Later Han (5th century AD) and combines the characters (&quot;extend, lengthen&quot;) and (&quot;jubilation&quot;). It should not be confused with the later Enkyō era of 1744–48, which used a different second character (, &quot;enjoy&quot;). 

==Events of the &quot;Enkyō&quot; era==
Initially, former-Emperor Fushimi administered the court up through the time he took the tonsure as a Buddhist monk, which happened after this &quot;nengō&quot; ended.
* 1308 (&quot;Enkyō 1&quot;): At the death of Emperor Go-Nijō, Hanazono accedes to the Chrysanthemum Throne at age 12 years; and Takaharu&quot;-shinnō&quot;, the second son of former-Emperor Go-Uda is elevated as the heir apparent under the direction of the Kamakura shogunate.
* 1308 (&quot;Enkyō 1, 10th month&quot;): Kujō Moronori resigns his position as &quot;sesshō&quot;; and he is replaced in that role by Takatsukasa Fuyuhira.

<doc id="1183118" wikidata="Q902514" url="?curid=1183118" title="Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope">
<text>A total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) is a type of microscope with which a thin region of a specimen, usually less than 200 nanometers can be observed.

TIRFM is an imaging modality which uses the excitation of fluorescent cells in a thin optical specimen section that is supported on a glass slide. The technique is based on the principle that when excitation light is totally internally reflected in a transparent solid coverglass at its interface with a liquid medium, an electromagnetic field, also known as an evanescent wave, is generated at the solid-liquid interface with the same frequency as the excitation light. The intensity of the evanescent wave exponentially decays with distance from the surface of the solid so that only fluorescent molecules within a few hundred nanometers of the solid are efficiently excited. Two-dimensional images of the fluorescence can then be obtained, although there are also mechanisms in which three-dimensional information on the location of vesicles or structures in cells can be obtained.

== History ==
Widefield fluorescence was introduced in 1910 which was an optical technique that illuminates the entire sample. Confocal microscopy was then introduced in 1960 which decreased the background and exposure time of the sample by directing light to a pinpoint and illuminating cones of light into the sample. In the 1980s, the introduction of TIRFM further decreased background and exposure time by only illuminating the thin section of the sample being examined.

==Background==
There are two common methods for producing the evanescent wave for TIRFM. The first is the prism method which uses a prism to direct the laser toward the interface between the coverglass and the media/cells at an incident angle sufficient to cause total internal reflection. This configuration has been applied to cellular microscopy for over 30 years but has never become a mainstream tool due to several limitations. Although there are many variations of the prism configuration, most restrict access to the specimen which makes it difficult to perform manipulations, inject media into the specimen space, or carry out physiological measurements. Another disadvantage is that in most configurations based on the inverted microscope designs, the illumination is introduced on the specimen side opposite of the objective optics which requires imaging of the evanescent field region through the bulk of the specimen. There is great complexity and precision required in imaging this system which meant that the prism method was not used by many biologists but rather limited to use by physicists.

The other method is known as the objective lens method which has increased the use of TIRFM in cellular microscopy and increased furthermore since a commercial solution became available. In this mechanism, one can easily switch between standard widefield fluorescence and TIRF by changing the off-axis position of the beam focus at the objective&#x27;s back focal plane. There are several developed ways to change the positions of the beam such as using an actuator that can change the position in relation to the fluorescence illuminator that is attached to the microscope.

== Application ==
In cell and molecular biology, a large number of molecular events in cellular surfaces such as cell adhesion, binding of cells by hormones, secretion of neurotransmitters, and membrane dynamics have been studied with conventional fluorescence microscopes. However, fluorophores that are bound to the specimen surface and those in the surrounding medium exist in an equilibrium state. When these molecules are excited and detected with a conventional fluorescence microscope, the resulting fluorescence from those fluorophores bound to the surface is often overwhelmed by the background fluorescence due to the much larger population of non-bound molecules. TIRFM allows for selective excitation of the surface-bound fluorophores, while non-bound molecules are not excited and do not fluoresce. Due to the fact of sub-micron surface selectivity, TIRFM has become a method of choice for single molecule detection.

There are many applications of TIRFM in cellular microscopy. Some of these applications include:

* Measuring the kinetics of receptor endocytosis in response to ligand binding and receptor movement
* Observing exocytic events through the loading of vesicles undergoing exocytosis with fluorescent dyes
* Qualitatively and quantitatively describing the roles different proteins play in endocytosis/exocytosis
* Observing the size, movement, and distance apart of the regions of contact between a cell and a solid substrate

With the ability to resolve individual vesicles optically and follow the dynamics of their interactions directly, TIRFM provides the capability to study the vast number of proteins involved in neurobiological processes in a manner that was not possible before.

=== Benefits ===
TIRFM provides several benefits over standard widefield and confocal fluorescence microscopy such as:

* The background is substantially decreased so structures can be seen clearly
* There is virtually no out-of-focus fluorescence collected which decrease blurring effects
* Cells are exposed to a significantly smaller amount of light which limits phototoxicity to cells

==Overview==
The idea of using total internal reflection to illuminate cells contacting the surface of glass was first described by E.J. Ambrose in 1956. This idea was then extended by Daniel Axelrod at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the early 1980s as TIRFM. A TIRFM uses an evanescent wave to selectively illuminate and excite fluorophores in a restricted region of the specimen immediately adjacent to the glass-water interface. The evanescent electromagnetic field decays exponentially from the interface, and thus penetrates to a depth of only approximately 100 nm into the sample medium. Thus the TIRFM enables a selective visualization of surface regions such as the basal plasma membrane (which are about 7.5 nm thick) of cells. Note, however, that the region visualized is at least a few hundred nanometers wide, so the cytoplasmic zone immediately beneath the plasma membrane is necessarily visualized in addition to the plasma membrane during TIRF microscopy. The selective visualization of the plasma membrane renders the features and events on the plasma membrane in living cells with high axial resolution.

TIRF can also be used to observe the fluorescence of a single molecule, making it an important tool of biophysics and quantitative biology. TIRF microscopy has also been applied in the single molecule detection of DNA biomarkers and SNP discrimination.

Cis-geometry (through-objective TIRFM) and trans-geometry (prism- and lightguide based TIRFM) have been shown to provide different quality of the effect of total internal reflection. In the case of trans-geometry, the excitation lightpath and the emission channel are separated, while in the case of objective-type TIRFM they share the objective and other optical elements of the microscope. Prism-based geometry was shown to generate clean evanescent wave, which exponential decay is close to theoretically predicted function. In the case of objective-based TIRFM, however, the evanescent wave is contaminated with intense stray light. The intensity of stray light was shown to amount 10–15% of the evanescent wave, which makes it difficult to interpret data obtained by objective-type TIRFM

== Mechanism ==
The basic components of the TIRFM device include:

# Excitation beam light source
# Cover slip and immersion oil
# Objective lens
# Sample specimen
# Detector

=== Objective-based vs prism-based ===
Key differences between objective-based (cis) and prism-based (trans) TIRFM are that prism based TIRFM requires usage of a prism/solution interface to generate the evanescent field, while objective-based TIRFM does not require a prism and utilizes a cover slip/solution interface to generate the evanescent field. Typically objective-based TIRFM are more popularly used, however have lowered imaging quality due to stray light noise within the evanescent wave.

==== Prism-based ====

* Less extraneous scattering
* Much cheaper (hundreds instead of thousands of dollars)
* Best for low-mid range magnification and water immersion objectives
* Easiest with free collimated laser sources
* Larger range of incidence angles
** Desirable to achieve smallest evanescent field depth

==== Objective-based ====

* High magnification and aperture
* Stable, easy to set up and align
* Works with free collimated laser, optical fiber, or conventional arc sources

== Methodology ==

=== Fundamental physics===
TIRFM is predicated on the optical phenomena of total internal reflection, in which waves arriving at a medium interface do not transmit into medium 2 but are completely reflected back into medium 1. Total internal reflection requires medium 2 to have a lower refractive index than medium 1, and for the waves must be incident at sufficiently oblique angles on the interface. An observed phenomena accompanying total internal reflection is the evanescent wave, which spatially extends away perpendicularly from the interface into medium 2, and decays exponentially, as a factor of wavelength, refractive index, and incident angle. It is the evanescent wave which is used to achieve increased excitation of the fluorophores close to the surface of the sample, and diminished excitation of superfluous fluorophores within solution.

For practical purposes, in objective based TIRF, medium 1 is typically a high refractive index glass coverslip, and medium 2 is the sample in solution with a lower refractive index. There may be immersion oil between the lens and the glass coverslip to prevent significant refraction through air.

=== Evanescent wave ===
The critical angle for excitatory light incidence can be derived from Snell&#x27;s law:

formula_1

For formula_2 the refractive index of sample, formula_3 the refractive index of the cover slip.

Thus, as the angle of incidence reaches formula_4, we begin observing effects of total internal reflection and evanescent wave, and as it surpasses formula_4 these effects are more prevalent.

The intensity of the evanescent wave is given by:

formula_6

With penetration depth formula_7 given by:

formula_8

Typically, formula_7 ≤~100 nanometers, which is typically much smaller than the wavelength of light, and much thinner than a slice from confocal microscopes.

For TIRFM imaging the wavelength of the excitation beam formula_10 within the sample can be selected for by filtering. Additionally, the range of incident angles formula_11 is determined by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, and requires that NA &gt; formula_12. This parameter can be adjusted by changing the angle the excitation beam enters the objective lens. Finally, the reflective indices (formula_12) of the solution and cover slip can be experimentally found or reported by manufacturers.

=== Excitation beam ===
For complex fluoroscope microscopy techniques, lasers are the preferred light source as they are highly uniform, intense, and near-monochromatic. However, it is noted that ARC LAMP light sources and other types of sources may also work. Typically the wavelength of excitation beam is designated by the requirements of the fluorophores within the sample, with most common excitation wavelengths being in the 400–700 nm range for biological samples.

In practice, a lightbox will generate a high intensity multichromatic laser, which will then be filtered to allow the desired wavelengths through to excite the sample. For objective-based TIRFM, the excitation beam and fluoresced emission beam will be captured via the same objective lens. Thus, to split the beams, a dichromatic mirror is used to reflect the incoming excitation beam towards the objective lens, and allow the emission beam to pass through into the detector. Additional filtering may be required to further separate emission and excitation wavelengths.

=== Emission beam ===
When excited with specific wavelengths of light, fluorophore dyes will reemit light at longer wavelengths (which contain less energy). In the context of TIRFM, only fluorophores close to the interface will be readily excited by the evanescent field, while those past ~100 nm will be highly attenuated. Light emitted by the fluorophores will be undirected, and thus will pass through the objective lens at varying locations with varying intensities. This signal will then pass through the dichromatic mirror and onward to the detector.

=== Cover slip and immersion oil ===
Glass cover slips typically have a reflective index around formula_14, while the immersion oil refractive index is a comparable formula_15. The medium of air, which has a refractive index of formula_16, would cause refraction of the excitation beam between the objective and the coverslip, thus the oil is used to buffer the region and prevent superfluous interface interactions before the beam reaches the interface between coverslip and sample.

=== Objective lens ===
The objective lens numerical aperture (NA) specifies the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.

To achieve the greatest incident angles, it is desirable to pass light at an off-axis angle through the peripheries of the lens.

==== Back focal plane (BPF) ====
The back focal plane (also called &quot;aperture plane&quot;) is the plane through which the excitatory beam is focused before passing through the objective. Adjusting the distance between the objective and BPF can yield different imaging magnification, as the incident angle will become less or more steep. The beam must be passed through the BPF off-axis in order to pass through the objective at its ends, allowing for the angle to be sufficiently greater than the critical angle. The beam must also be focused at the BPF because this ensures that the light passing through the objective is collimated, interacting with the cover slip at the same angle and thus all totally internally reflecting.

=== Sample ===
The sample should be adsorbed to the surface of the glass cover slide and stained with appropriate fluorophores to resolve the features desired within the sample. This is in protocol with any other fluorescent microscopy technique.

=== Dichroic (dichromatic) filter ===
The dichroic filter is an edge filter used at an oblique angle of incidence (typically 45°) to efficiently reflect light in the excitation band and to transmit light in the emission band. The 45° angle of the filter separates the path of the excitation and emission beam. The filter is composed of a complex system of multiple layers of metals, metal salts and dielectrics which have been vacuum-deposited onto thin glass. This coating is designed to have high reflectivity for shorter wavelengths and high transmission for longer wavelengths. While the filter transmits the selected excitation light (shorter wavelength) through the objective and onto the plane of the specimen, it also passes emission fluorescence light (longer wavelength) to the barrier filter and reflecting any scattered excitation light back in the direction of the laser source. This maximizes the amount of exciting radiation passing through the filter and emitted fluorescence beam that is detected by the detector.

=== Barrier filter ===
The barrier filter mainly blocks off undesired wavelengths, especially shorter excitation light wavelengths. It is typically a bandpass filter that passes only the wavelengths emitted by the fluorophore and blocks all undesired light outside this band. More modern microscopes enable the barrier filter to be changed according to the wavelength of the fluorophore&#x27;s specific emission.

== Image detection and resolution ==
The image is detected by a charged-coupled device (CCD) digital camera. CCD cameras have photon detectors, which are thin silicon wafers, assembled into 2D arrays of light-sensitive regions. The detector arrays capture and store image information in the form of localized electrical charge that varies with incident light intensity. As shown in the schematic the photons are transform to electrons by the detectors and the electrons are converted to readable electrical signal in the circuit board. The electrical signal is then convoluted with a point spread function (PSF) to sample the original signal. As such, image resolution is highly dependent on the number of detectors and the point spread function will determine the image resolution.

=== Image artifact and noise ===
Most fluorescence imaging techniques exhibit background noise due to illuminating and reconstructing large slices (in the z-direction) of the samples. Since TIRFM uses an evanescent wave to fluoresce a thin slice of the sample, there is inherently less background noise and artifacts. However, there are still other noises and artifacts such as poisson noise, optical aberrations, photobleaching, and other fluorescence molecules.

Poissonian noise are fundamental uncertainties with the measurement of light. This will cause uncertainties during the detection of fluorescence photons. If N photons are measured in a particular measurement, there is a 63% probability that the true average value is in the range between N +√N and N −√N. This noise may cause misrepresentation of the object at incorrect pixel locations.

Optical aberrations can arise from diffraction of fluorescence light or microscope and objective misalignment. Diffraction of light on the sample slide can spread the fluorescence signal and result in blurring in the convoluted images. Similarly, if there is a misalignment between the objective lens, filter, and detector, the excitation or emission beam may not be in focus and can cause blurring in the images.

Photobleaching can occur when the covalent or noncovalent bonds in the fluorophores are destructed by the excitation light and can no longer fluoresce. The fluorescing substances will always degrade to some extent by the energy of the exciting radiation and will cause the fluorescence to fade and result in a dark blurry image. Photobleaching is inevitable but can be minimized by avoiding unwanted light exposure and using immersion oils to minimize light scattering.

Autofluorescence can occur in certain cell structures where the natural compound in the structure would fluoresce after being excited at relatively shorter wavelengths (similar to that of the excitation wavelength). Induced fluorescence can also occur when certain non-autofluorescent compounds become fluorescent after binding to certain chemicals (such as formaldehyde). These fluorescence can result in artifacts or background noise in the image. Noise from other fluorescence compounds can be effectively eliminated by using filters to capture the desired fluorescence wavelength, or by making sure the autofluorescence compounds are not present in the sample.

=== Current and future work ===
Modern fluorescence techniques attempt to incorporate methods to eliminate some blurring and noises. Optical aberrations are generally deterministic (it is constant throughout the image process and across different samples). Deterministic blurring can be eliminated by deconvoluting the signal and subtracting the known artifact. The deconvolution technique is simply using an inverse fourier transform to obtain the original fluorescence signal and remove the artifact.

Nevertheless, deconvolution has only been shown to work if there is a strong fluorescence signal or when the noise is clearly identified. In addition, deconvolution performs poorly because it does not include statistical information and can not reduce non-deterministic noise such as poissonian noise. To obtain better image resolution and quality, researchers have used statistical techniques to model the probability where photons may be distributed on the detector. This technique, called the maximum likelihood method, is being further improved by algorithms to improve its performance speed.

<text>Tignes-les-Brevières (; 1550m) is a small skiing village in the French Alps that is the lowest point of the ski resort of Tignes.

Owing to its geographical location the village receives as much snowfall as its neighbours and during the 2005/6 season, Les Brevieres had over 4 metres of snow. The town is connected to other parts of Tignes after ski runs shut by a gondola and bus service.

==Overview==
Les Brévières is a traditional village and is much more picturesque than the other villages that make up the resort of Tignes. It has grown in size in recent years and now offers many more facilities whilst still retaining its charm.

The skiing area between Tignes and Val d&#x27;Isère is marketed as L&#x27;Espace Killy, after the 1968 (Winter) Olympic gold medalist, Jean-Claude Killy.

Tignes offers 39 ski lifts: 1 funiculaire, 1 cable car, 3 gondola lifts, 21 chairlifts, 13 drag lifts – an area of 150 km2 of ski runs – 80 ski trails: 6 green, 38 blue, 20 red, 16 black – a maximum vertical distance of 1900 metres from the Grande Motte (3450 metres) to Les Brévières (1550 metres).

The ski season is very long in Espace Killy with the lifts opening around December 1 and closing after the May Bank Holiday around May 6–8. Skiing down to Brevieres is usually very good late season due to the extensive use of snow cannons on the runs to the village.

There is a nursery slope with a free drag lift.

Connections to the rest of the Espace Killy are fast via a gondola then a chair. It takes about 20 minutes on the lifts, followed by one piste into Tignes Le Lac. Alternative routes are available, either 3 chairs up and the same piste down, or one chair to Tignes les Boisses followed by a free bus up to Tignes. Returning to Tignes les Brevieres requires just one chair lift (Chaudannes) which takes 6 minutes from Tignes le Lac.

Village facilities include:
* 3 ski shops
* ESF ski school
*small supermarket
* tabac
* cash point
* 9 bars &amp; restaurants

Accommodation:
* in recent years new development has substantially increased the pool of chalet and apartment accommodation

<doc id="1183122" wikidata="Q473195" url="?curid=1183122" title="Water potential">
<text>Water potential is the potential energy of water per unit volume relative to pure water in reference conditions. Water potential quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another due to osmosis, gravity, mechanical pressure and matrix effects such as capillary action (which is caused by surface tension). The concept of water potential has proved useful in understanding and computing water movement within plants, animals, and soil. Water potential is typically expressed in potential energy per unit volume and very often is represented by the Greek letter ψ.

Water potential integrates a variety of different potential drivers of water movement, which may operate in the same or different directions. Within complex biological systems, many potential factors may be operating simultaneously. For example, the addition of solutes lowers the potential (negative vector), while an increase in pressure increases the potential (positive vector). If the flow is not restricted, water will move from an area of higher water potential to an area that is lower potential. A common example is water with dissolved salts, such as seawater or the fluid in a living cell. These solutions have negative water potential, relative to the pure water reference. With no restriction on flow, water will move from the locus of greater potential (pure water) to the locus of lesser (the solution); flow proceeds until the difference in potential is equalized or balanced by another water potential factor, such as pressure or elevation.

==Components of water potential==

Many different factors may affect the total water potential, and the sum of these potentials determines the overall water potential and the direction of water flow:

:formula_1

where:
* formula_2 is the reference correction,
* formula_3 is the solute or osmotic potential,
* formula_4 is the pressure component,
* formula_5 is the gravimetric component,
* formula_6 is the potential due to humidity, and
* formula_7 is the potential due to matrix effects (e.g., fluid cohesion and surface tension.)

All of these factors are quantified as potential energies per unit volume, and different subsets of these terms may be used for particular applications (e.g., plants or soils). Different conditions are also defined as reference depending on the application: for example, in soils, the reference condition is typically defined as pure water at the soil surface.

===Pressure potential===

Pressure potential is based on mechanical pressure and is an important component of the total water potential within plant cells. Pressure potential increases as water enters a cell. As water passes through the cell wall and cell membrane, it increases the total amount of water present inside the cell, which exerts an outward pressure that is opposed by the structural rigidity of the cell wall. By creating this pressure, the plant can maintain turgor, which allows the plant to keep its rigidity. Without turgor, plants will lose structure and wilt.

The pressure potential in a plant cell is usually positive. In plasmolysed cells, pressure potential is almost zero. Negative pressure potentials occur when water is pulled through an open system such as a plant xylem vessel. Withstanding negative pressure potentials (frequently called &quot;tension&quot;) is an important adaptation of the xylem. This tension can be measured empirically using the Pressure bomb.

===Osmotic potential (solute potential)===

Pure water is usually defined as having an osmotic potential (formula_3) of zero, and in this case, solute potential can never be positive. The relationship of solute concentration (in molarity) to solute potential is given by the van &#x27;t Hoff equation:

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the concentration in molarity of the solute, formula_11 is the van &#x27;t Hoff factor, the ratio of amount of particles in solution to amount of formula units dissolved, formula_12 is the ideal gas constant, and formula_13 is the absolute
temperature.

For example, when a solute is dissolved in water, water molecules are less likely to diffuse away via osmosis than when there is no solute. A solution will have a lower and hence more negative water potential than that of pure water. Furthermore, the more solute molecules present, the more negative the solute potential is.

Osmotic potential has important implications for many living organisms. If a living cell is surrounded by a more concentrated solution, the cell will tend to lose water to the more negative water potential (formula_14) of the surrounding environment. This can be the case for marine organisms living in sea water and halophytic plants growing in saline environments. In the case of a plant cell, the flow of water out of the cell may eventually cause the plasma membrane to pull away from the cell wall, leading to plasmolysis. Most plants, however, have the ability to increase solute inside the cell to drive the flow of water into the cell and maintain turgor.

This effect can be used to power an osmotic power plant.

A soil solution also experiences osmotic potential. The osmotic potential is made possible due to the presence of both inorganic and organic solutes in the soil solution. As water molecules increasingly clump around solute ions or molecules, the freedom of movement, and thus the potential energy, of the water is lowered. As the concentration of solutes is increased, the osmotic potential of the soil solution is reduced. Since water has a tendency to move toward lower energy levels, water will want to travel toward the zone of higher solute concentrations. Although, liquid water will only move in response to such differences in osmotic potential if a semipermeable membrane exists between the zones of high and low osmotic potential. A semipermeable membrane is necessary because it allows water through its membrane while preventing solutes from moving through its membrane. If no membrane is present, movement of the solute, rather than of the water, largely equalizes concentrations.

Since regions of soil are usually not divided by a semipermeable membrane, the osmotic potential typically has a negligible influence on the mass movement of water in soils. On the other hand, osmotic potential has an extreme influence on the rate of water uptake by plants. If soils are high in soluble salts, the osmotic potential is likely to be lower in the soil solution than in the plant root cells. In such cases, the soil solution would severely restrict the rate of water uptake by plants. In salty soils, the osmotic potential of soil water may be so low that the cells in young seedlings start to collapse (plasmolyze).

===Matrix potential (Matric potential)===

When water is in contact with solid particles (e.g., clay or sand particles within soil), adhesive intermolecular forces between the water and the solid can be large and important. The forces between the water molecules and the solid particles in combination with attraction among water molecules promote surface tension and the formation of menisci within the solid matrix. Force is then required to break these menisci. The magnitude of matrix potential depends on the distances between solid particles—the width of the menisci (also capillary action and differing Pa at ends of the capillary)—and the chemical composition of the solid matrix (meniscus, macroscopic motion due to ionic attraction).

In many cases, the absolute value of matrix potential can be relatively large in comparison to the other components of water potential discussed above. Matrix potential markedly reduces the energy state of water near particle surfaces. Although water movement due to matrix potential may be slow, it is still extremely important in supplying water to plant roots and in engineering applications. The matrix potential is always negative because the water attracted by the soil matrix has an energy state lower than that of pure water. Matrix potential only occurs in unsaturated soil above the water table. If the matrix potential approaches a value of zero, nearly all soil pores are completely filled with water, i.e. fully saturated and at maximum retentive capacity. The matrix potential can vary considerably among soils. In the case that water drains into less-moist soil zones of similar porosity, the matrix potential is generally in the range of −10 to −30 kPa.

==Empirical examples==
===Soil-plant-air continuum===

At a potential of 0 kPa, the soil is in a saturation state. At saturation, all soil pores are filled with water, and water typically drains from large pores by gravity. At a potential of −33 kPa, or −1/3 bar, (−10 kPa for sand), soil is at field capacity. Typically, at field capacity, air is in the macropores, and water is in the micropores. Field capacity is the optimal condition for plant growth and microbial activity. At a potential of −1500 kPa, the soil is at its permanent wilting point, at which plant roots cannot extract the water through osmotic diffusion. Soil waterways still evaporate at more negative potentials down to a hygroscopic level, at which soil water is held by solid particles in a thin film by molecular adhesion forces.

In contrast, atmospheric water potentials are much more negative—a typical value for dry air is −100 MPa, though this value depends on the temperature and the humidity. Root water potential must be more negative than the soil, and the stem water potential must be an intermediate lower value than the roots but higher than the leaf water potential to create a passive flow of water from the soil to the roots, up the stem, to the leaves and then into the atmosphere.

===Measurement techniques===
A tensiometer, electrical resistance gypsum block, neutron probes, or time-domain reflectometry (TDR) can be used to determine soil water potential energy. Tensiometers are limited to 0 to −85 kPa, electrical resistance blocks are limited to −90 to −1500 kPa, neutron probes are limited to 0 to −1500 kPa, and a TDR is limited to 0 to −10,000 kPa. A scale can estimate water weight (percentage composition) if special equipment is not on hand.

<text>USS &quot;Kraken&quot; (SS-370), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the kraken, a legendary sea monster believed to haunt the coasts of Norway.

&quot;Kraken&quot; commissioned in September 1944 and saw action during the last year of World War II, serving in the Pacific Theater and making four war patrols. In 1946 she was placed in reserve.

In 1959 &quot;Kraken&quot; was transferred to the Spanish Navy as &quot;Almirante García de los Reyes&quot;. She was scrapped in 1982.

==USS &quot;Kraken&quot; (SS-370)==
&quot;Kraken&quot; was launched 30 April 1944, by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisc.; sponsored by Mrs. John Z. Anderson, wife of Congressman Anderson of California; and commissioned 8 September 1944.

&quot;Kraken&quot; steamed by way of Chicago to Lockport, Ill., 27 September 1944, and was carried in a floating drydock down the Mississippi River arriving at Algiers, La., 4 October. Ten days later &quot;Kraken&quot; cleared Algiers, transited the Panama Canal and underwent intensive training in the Gulf of Panama. She sailed for Hawaii 4 November and arrived Pearl Harbor 21 November.

&quot;Kraken&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 12 December 1944, for her first war patrol, touched at Saipan 23 December, set course for Indochina next morning. There she maintained lifeguard duty in support of 3rd Fleet carrier strikes. While on station she rescued a pilot from rough seas and evaded a strafing enemy plane by diving. Finding no targets, &quot;Kraken&quot; set course for Fremantle, Australia, arriving there 14 February 1945.

&quot;Kraken&quot; departed on her second war patrol 15 March and maintained lifeguard duty in the South China Sea supporting aircraft carrier strikes against Singapore and Saigon. She returned to Subic Bay, P.I., 26 April.

Departing on her third war patrol on 19 May 1945, &quot;Kraken&quot; set course for the Gulf of Siam. After searching in vain for enemy targets, she shifted to the Java Sea where on 19 June she bombarded Merak and riddled a coaster and a small ship with and 40 mm projectiles. She saw the coaster sink and she left the small ship ablaze before clearing the harbor.

Three days later, while chasing an eight-ship convoy, &quot;Kraken&quot;&#x27;s torpedoes sank an oiler and a coastal steamer and her guns inflicted heavy damage on one of the Japanese submarine chasers. Then &quot;Kraken&quot; proudly sailed into Fremantle, Australia, 3 July 1945, ending her most successful patrol.

&quot;Kraken&quot; sailed on her fourth and last patrol 29 July. While seeking the enemy in the Java Sea, her patrol was cut short when she received news of Japan&#x27;s capitulation. Sailing for Subic Bay, she arrived 21 August.

Kraken cleared Subic Bay 31 August 1945, touched at Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Francisco 22 September. On 14 October she rendezvoused with Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet and formed a part of honor escort for Halsey, as he passed under the Golden Gate Bridge in his flagship, . Ten days later &quot;Kraken&quot; visited Longview, Wash., for the first postwar Navy Day celebrations and returned to San Francisco 31 October where she was placed out of commission 4 May 1946 in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

== &quot;Almirante García de los Reyes&quot; (S-31) ==

&quot;Kraken&quot; remained in reserve status until 18 September 1958, when she was assigned to Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for activation overhaul and given a Fleet Snorkel conversion preparatory to transfer on loan to Spain. After several months of familiarization at Pearl Harbor for her new crew, on 25 October 1959 she was commissioned &quot;Almirante García de los Reyes&quot;, in memory of Don Mateo García de los Reyes (1862–1936), the Spanish Navy&#x27;s pioneer in submarines. The ship&#x27;s unusually long name posed a practical problem, so the abbreviation &quot;A. G. de los Reyes&quot; was often used. Originally designated E-1, she was redesignated S-31 in 1961 to conform to the new, NATO-style numbering system adopted by the Spanish Navy. &quot;Almirante García de los Reyes&quot; was the only modern Spanish submarine in the 1960s (Spain, also had one German Type VIIC, Ex U-573, and 3 &quot;insecure&quot; and old Spanish D-class submarines), and was nicknamed &quot;treinta y único&quot; (&quot;thirty &quot;only-one&quot;&quot;) and became almost legendary.

&quot;A. G. de los Reyes&quot;&#x27;s voyage via the Panama Canal to Cartagena, Spain took till late January 1960.

&quot;García&quot; was decommissioned, 16 September 1974, sold to Spain, and struck from the US Naval Register, 1 November 1974. She was to have been cannibalized, but had to be overhauled and recommissioned, 1 September 1975, to replace , which had suffered a severe engine failure the previous spring and had to be stricken. &quot;García&quot; was finally decommissioned in April 1981, struck from the Spanish Navy list, 1 April 1982, and scrapped.

<text>, also romanized as Kō-ō, was a Japanese era name (年号, &quot;nengō&quot;, lit. year name) of the Northern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts after Kakei and before Meitoku. This period spanned the years from February 1389 to March 1390. The emperor in Kyoto was The Southern Court rival in Yoshino during this time-frame was .

==Nanboku-chō overview==
This illegitimate was established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336. Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate were incorporated in Imperial chronologies, even though the Imperial Regalia were never in their possession.

During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

==Change of era==
* 1389, also called : The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Kakei&quot; 3.

In this time frame, Genchū (1384–1393) was the Southern Court equivalent &quot;nengō.&quot;

==Events of the Kōō era==
* 1389 (&quot;Kōō 1&quot;): Dissension continues in Toki family in Mino.
* 1389 (&quot;Kōō 1&quot;): Yoshimitsu pacifies Kyūshū and distributes lands; Yoshimitsu opposed by Kamakura &quot;kanrei&quot; Ashikaga Ujimitsu.
* 1389 (&quot;Kōō 1, 7th month&quot;): The &quot;udaijin&quot; Saioinji Sanetoshi died at the age of 56.
* 1390 (&quot;Kōō 2&quot;): Kusunoki defeated; Yamana Ujikiyo chastises Tokinaga.

<text>Microsoft Blend for Visual Studio (formerly Microsoft Expression Blend) is a user interface design tool developed and sold by Microsoft for creating graphical interfaces for web and desktop applications that blend the features of these two types of applications. It is an interactive, WYSIWYG front-end for designing XAML-based interfaces for Windows Presentation Foundation, Silverlight and UWP applications. It was one of the applications in the Microsoft Expression Studio suite before that suite was discontinued.

Expression Blend supports the WPF text engine with advanced OpenType typography and ClearType, vector-based 2D widgets, and 3D widgets with hardware acceleration via DirectX.

==History==
Expression Blend was code-named &quot;Sparkle&quot;, and originally the product was announced as &quot;Microsoft Expression Interactive Designer&quot;, before it was renamed Expression Blend in December 2006.

On January 24, 2007, Microsoft released the first public Community Technology Preview of Expression Blend as a free download on their web site. The final version was released to manufacturing along with other Expression products on April 30, 2007. The RTM news was announced at Microsoft&#x27;s MIX 07 conference for web developers and designers. Expression Blend Service Pack 1 was released in November 2007. Expression Blend requires .NET Framework 3.0. Expression Blend and Expression Web are also available as part of the MSDN Premium subscription.

In December 2012, Microsoft announced that they were discontinuing the standalone Expression suite tools. Expression Blend was integrated into Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio Express for Windows 8.

<text>LessTif is a defunct free software reimplementation or clone of the Motif computer programming toolkit. The project aimed for full source- and binary-code compatibility with Motif. While this was not achieved, many Motif applications could run with LessTif or be compiled with it.

As opposed to Motif, which was distributed until October 2012 under a proprietary license that could require the payment of royalties, LessTif was developed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The license of Motif was the main motivation for the development of LessTif. Following the release of the original Motif toolkit as open source under the LGPL in 2012, the LessTif project was abandoned.

<text>Max Wilhelm Theodore Reischle (18 June 1858 – 11 December 1905) was an Austrian-born German Protestant systematic theologian. He was born in Vienna, and died in Tübingen.

In 1887, he received his doctorate at the University of Tübingen, later working as a professor at the &quot;Karlsgymnasium&quot; in Stuttgart (from 1889). In 1892, he was appointed a full professor of practical theology at the University of Giessen, then become a professor of systematic theology at the University of Göttingen (1895). During the following year, he accepted a call to Halle as chair of systematic theology.

His studies largely dealt with mysticism in theology, the philosophy of religion and the transmission of ethical principles in academic instruction.

<text>A dumper or dumper truck is a vehicle designed for carrying bulk material, often on building sites. A dumper has a body which tilts or opens at the back for unloading and is usually an open 4-wheeled vehicle with the load skip in front of the driver. The skip can tip to dump the load; this is where the name &quot;dumper&quot; comes from. They are normally diesel powered. A towing eye is fitted for secondary use as a site tractor. Dumpers with rubber tracks are used in special circumstances and provide a more even distribution of weight compared to tires. Continuous tracks allow the operator to carry heavier payload on slick, snowy, or muddy surfaces, and are popular in some countries. Rubber track dumpers offer even weight distribution for transporting heavy payloads over challenging terrains like mud or snow, popular in certain regions.

==Background==
One of the earliest British dumpers was the Muir-Hill, which was based on the Fordson tractor with 2 cubic yard bucket, driving on the front axle and steered by the back wheels. Devised in 1927, and on sale by 1931, it gained a lot of versatility when in 1933 Dunlop introduced &#x27;tractor-style&#x27; pneumatic low pressure tyres. This allowed it to travel on tarmac roads or off-road, which was of particular advantage on construction sites. Originally advertised as the &quot;dumping tractor&quot;, it soon became known as the Muir-Hill dumper.

Modern dumpers have payloads of up to and usually steer by articulating at the middle of the chassis (pivot steering). They have multi-cylinder diesel engines, some turbocharged, electric start and hydraulics for tipping and steering and are usually four-wheel drive. An A-frame known as a ROPS (Roll-Over Protection) frame, may be fitted over the seat to protect the driver if the dumper rolls over. Some dumpers have FOPS (Falling Object Protection) as well. Lifting skips are available for discharging above ground level. In the 1990s, dumpers with swivel skips, which could be rotated to tip sideways, became popular, especially for working in narrow sites such as road works. Dumpers are the most common cause of serious accidents involving construction plant.

Nowadays these vehicles are also called &quot;dumper&quot; in some mainland European languages.

<text>Isidore Justin Séverin, Baron Taylor (5 August 1789 – 6 September 1879) was a French dramatist, artist, and philanthropist. He was closely associated with the development of French theatre, a pioneer of Romanticism, and also a noted traveller.

==Life and career==
Isidore Taylor was born in Brussels on 5 August 1789; his father Hélie Taylor was English born and took French nationality, and his mother was the Belgian Marie-Jacqueline Walwein (from what was then the Austrian Netherlands). Originally destined for a military career, the young man neglected this in favour of travelling about Europe and later the Near East.

Among the fruits of his travels was a series of books on the French regions, &quot;Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l&#x27;ancienne France&quot; (1820–63), the nearly 7000 lithographs in which were the first to catalogue the French artistic patrimony. Another book, &quot;La Syrie, l&#x27;Égypte, la Palestine et la Judée&quot; (Paris, 1839), was illustrated with the author&#x27;s watercolours, two of which are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Ennobled in 1825 by King Charles X, he was by this time collecting Spanish art on behalf of the new French King Louis Philippe I, who made him a Commissioner of Art in 1838. These paintings constituted the then named Spanish gallery of the Louvre.

George Borrow describes meeting Taylor before and during the 1830s in his book &quot;The Bible in Spain&quot;.
:&quot;He has visited most portions of the earth, and it is remarkable enough that we are continually encountering each other in strange places and under singular circumstances. Whenever he descries me, whether in the street or the desert, the brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin &quot;haimas&quot;, at Novgorod or Stambul, he flings up his arms and exclaims, &quot;&#x27;O ciel&quot;! I have again the felicity of seeing my cherished and most respectable B…&#x27;&quot;. 

Early on the Baron was also active in the theatrical world. Between 1825 and 1838 he served as Royal Commissioner of the Theatre Francaise. He used this position to encourage the production of Romantic drama. Among those he helped was Alexandre Dumas, who dedicated to Taylor his first successful play, &quot;Henri III et sa cour&quot; (The court of Henry III, 1829). Taylor himself authored plays with a Levantine background, &quot;Ismael et Maryam, ou l&#x27;arabe et la chrétienne&quot; (The Arab and the Christian, 1821) and &quot;La fille de l&#x27;Hébreu et le chevalier du temple&quot; (The Jewess and the Templar, 1823) and co-authored with Charles Nodier an adaptation of Charles Maturin&#x27;s successful drama, &quot;Bertram ou le pirate&quot; (1821).

After age 50 in the 1840s he focussed on philanthropic activity, setting up several mutual societies for members of the artistic professions. They continue to this day as the Taylor Foundation. In recognition of his work he was elected to the Académie Française in 1847, named a senator of the Second Empire in 1869 and made an officer of the Legion of Honour in 1877.

==Artistic representations==

After his death, Taylor was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery with a memorial statue by sculptor Gabriel-Jules Thomas. A decorative bust by Tony Noel (1845-1909) was also erected on behalf of the Taylor Foundation on the Boulevard Saint Martin. Both of these show the baron in old age. There were attractive earlier portraits of him by Jean Alaux when he was 22, and by Federico de Madrazo y Kuntz at the age of 44. The latter is a three-quarters bust that pictures him in his official uniform in 1838. He also figures in the crowded canvas of Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot; (1862). Taylor is pictured in the mid-foreground to the left with his cane beneath his arm as he talks to Charles Baudelaire and Theophile Gautier.

<text>Inul Daratista (born Ainur Rokhimah on 21 January 1979) is a dangdut singer and performance artist from Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia. She became nationally famous in 2003, and is known for her suggestive style of dancing that caused major controversy in Indonesia. Inul is a corrupted version of Ainur, and the singer&#x27;s childhood pet name. As she began her musical career singing in a rock band, she adopted the stage name Daratista.

Inul Daratista rose to national prominence after a televised January 2003 concert in Jakarta. Her dance moves, which she calls &quot;Goyang Inul&quot;, goyang-gerudi, or &quot;ngebor&quot; (lit. &#x27;drilling&#x27;), quickly became the source of controversy due to her gyrating hip motions. Some conservative Muslim organizations such as the Indonesian Muslim Council (Indonesian: Majelis Muslimin Indonesia, abbreviated MMI) called for a ban on her concerts. She was cited as a reason to pass a national anti-pornography bill that was drafted during the height of the controversy in mid-2003 and became a law in October 2008. Inul&#x27;s dance style was also criticised by other dangdut singers, most vocally Rhoma Irama, for &quot;corrupting&quot; the genre, though these criticisms did little to dent her popularity.

==Name==
Inul&#x27;s birth name, Ainur Rokhimah, means &quot;eyes of blessed love&quot;. Her stage name, Inul Daratista, is often mistranslated as &quot;the girl with breasts&quot;.

==Influences==
Inul&#x27;s idols include dangdut singer Rita Sugiarto and pop singers Paramitha Rusady, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez.

==Personal life==
At 16 years old and a freshman in high school, Inul married Adam Suseno, then 21, on 29 May 1995. The couple&#x27;s first child, Yusuf Ivander Damares, was born on 19 May 2009.

<doc id="1183175" wikidata="Q568968" url="?curid=1183175" title="Inlet manifold">
<text>An inlet manifold or intake manifold (in American English) is the part of an internal combustion engine that supplies the fuel/air mixture to the cylinders. The word &quot;manifold&quot; comes from the Old English word &quot;manigfeald&quot; (from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;manig&quot; [many] and &quot;feald&quot; [repeatedly]) and refers to the multiplying of one (pipe) into many. 

In contrast, an exhaust manifold collects the exhaust gases from multiple cylinders into a smaller number of pipes – often down to one pipe.

The primary function of the intake manifold is to &quot;evenly&quot; distribute the combustion mixture (or just air in a direct injection engine) to each intake port in the cylinder head(s). Even distribution is important to optimize the efficiency and performance of the engine. It may also serve as a mount for the carburetor, throttle body, fuel injectors and other components of the engine.

Due to the downward movement of the pistons and the restriction caused by the throttle valve, in a reciprocating spark ignition piston engine, a partial vacuum (lower than atmospheric pressure) exists in the intake manifold. This manifold vacuum can be substantial, and can be used as a source of automobile ancillary power to drive auxiliary systems: power assisted brakes, emission control devices, cruise control, ignition advance, windshield wipers, power windows, ventilation system valves, etc.

This vacuum can also be used to draw any piston blow-by gases from the engine&#x27;s crankcase. This is known as a positive crankcase ventilation system, in which the gases are burned with the fuel/air mixture.

The intake manifold has historically been manufactured from aluminium or cast iron, but use of composite plastic materials is gaining popularity (e.g. most Chrysler 4-cylinders, Ford Zetec 2.0, Duratec 2.0 and 2.3, and GM&#x27;s Ecotec series).

==Turbulence==
The carburetor or the fuel injectors spray fuel droplets into the air in the manifold. Due to electrostatic forces and condensation from the boundary layer, some of the fuel will form into pools along the walls of the manifold, and due to surface tension of the fuel, small droplets may combine into larger droplets in the airstream. Both actions are undesirable because they create inconsistencies in the air-fuel ratio. Turbulence in the intake helps to break up fuel droplets, improving the degree of atomization. Better atomization allows for a more complete burn of all the fuel and helps reduce engine knock by enlarging the flame front. To achieve this turbulence it is a common practice to leave the surfaces of the intake and intake ports in the cylinder head rough and unpolished.

Only a certain degree of turbulence is useful in the intake. Once the fuel is sufficiently atomized, additional turbulence causes unneeded pressure drops and a drop in engine performance.

==Volumetric efficiency==

The design and orientation of the intake manifold is a major factor in the volumetric efficiency of an engine. Abrupt contour changes provoke pressure drops, resulting in less air (and/or fuel) entering the combustion chamber; high-performance manifolds have smooth contours and gradual transitions between adjacent segments.

Modern intake manifolds usually employ &quot;runners&quot;, individual tubes extending to each intake port on the cylinder head which emanate from a central volume or &quot;plenum&quot; beneath the carburetor. The purpose of the runner is to take advantage of the Helmholtz resonance property of air. Air flows at considerable speed through the open valve. When the valve closes, the air that has not yet entered the valve still has a lot of momentum and compresses against the valve, creating a pocket of high pressure. This high-pressure air begins to equalize with lower-pressure air in the manifold. Due to the air&#x27;s inertia, the equalization will tend to oscillate: At first the air in the runner will be at a lower pressure than the manifold. The air in the manifold then tries to equalize back into the runner, and the oscillation repeats. This process occurs at the speed of sound, and in most manifolds travels up and down the runner many times before the valve opens again.

The smaller the cross-sectional area of the runner, the higher the pressure changes on resonance for a given airflow. This aspect of Helmholtz resonance reproduces one result of the Venturi effect. When the piston accelerates downwards, the pressure at the output of the intake runner is reduced. This low pressure pulse runs to the input end, where it is converted into an over-pressure pulse. This pulse travels back through the runner and rams air through the valve. The valve then closes.

To harness the full power of the Helmholtz resonance effect, the opening of the intake valve must be timed correctly, otherwise the pulse could have a negative effect. This poses a very difficult problem for engines, since valve timing is dynamic and based on engine speed, whereas the pulse timing is static and dependent on the length of the intake runner and the speed of sound. The traditional solution has been to tune the length of the intake runner for a specific engine speed where maximum performance is desired. However, modern technology has given rise to a number of solutions involving electronically controlled valve timing (for example Valvetronic), and dynamic intake geometry (see below).

As a result of &quot;resonance tuning&quot;, some naturally aspirated intake systems operate at a volumetric efficiency above 100%: the air pressure in the combustion chamber before the compression stroke is greater than the atmospheric pressure. In combination with this intake manifold design feature, the exhaust manifold design, as well as the exhaust valve opening time can be so calibrated as to achieve greater evacuation of the cylinder. The exhaust manifolds achieve a vacuum in the cylinder just before the piston reaches top dead center. The opening inlet valve can then—at typical compression ratios—fill 10% of the cylinder before beginning downward travel. Instead of achieving higher pressure in the cylinder, the inlet valve can stay open after the piston reaches bottom dead center while the air still flows in.

In some engines the intake runners are straight for minimal resistance. In most engines, however, the runners have curves, some very convoluted to achieve desired runner length. These turns allow for a more compact manifold, with denser packaging of the whole engine, as a result. Also, these &quot;snaked&quot; runners are needed for some variable length/ split runner designs, and allow the size of the plenum to be reduced. In an engine with at least six cylinders the averaged intake flow is nearly constant and the plenum volume can be smaller. To avoid standing waves within the plenum it is made as compact as possible. The intake runners each use a smaller part of the plenum surface than the inlet, which supplies air to the plenum, for aerodynamic reasons. Each runner is placed to have nearly the same distance to the main inlet. Runners whose cylinders fire close after each other, are not placed as neighbors.

In 180-degree intake manifolds, originally designed for carburetor V8 engines, the two plane, the split plenum intake manifold separates the intake pulses which the manifold experiences by 180 degrees in the firing order. This minimizes interference of one cylinder&#x27;s pressure waves with those of another, giving better torque from smooth mid-range flow. Such manifolds may have been originally designed for either two- or four-barrel carburetors, but now are used with both throttle-body and multi-point fuel injection. An example of the latter is the Honda J engine which converts to a single plane manifold around 3500 rpm for greater peak flow and horsepower.

Older heat riser manifolds with &#x27;wet runners&#x27; for carbureted engines used exhaust gas diversion through the intake manifold to provide vaporizing heat. The amount of exhaust gas flow diversion was controlled by a heat riser valve in the exhaust manifold, and employed a bi-metallic spring which changed tension according to the heat in the manifold. Today&#x27;s fuel-injected engines do not require such devices.

==Variable-length intake manifold==
A variable-length intake manifold (VLIM) is an internal combustion engine manifold technology.
Four common implementations exist. First, two discrete intake runners with different length are employed, and a butterfly valve can close the short path. Second the intake runners can be bent around a common plenum, and a sliding valve separates them from the plenum with a variable length. Straight high-speed runners can receive plugs, which contain small long runner extensions. The plenum of a 6- or 8-cylinder engine can be parted into halves, with the even firing cylinders in one half and the odd firing cylinders in the other part. Both sub-plenums and the air intake are connected to an Y (sort of main plenum). The air oscillates between both sub-plenums, with a large pressure oscillation there, but a constant pressure at the main plenum. Each runner from a sub plenum to the main plenum can be changed in length. For V engines this can be implemented by parting a single large plenum at high engine speed by means of sliding valves into it when speed is reduced.

As the name implies, VLIM can vary the length of the intake tract in order to optimize power and torque, as well as provide better fuel efficiency.

There are two main effects of variable intake geometry:
* Venturi effect: At low rpm, the speed of the airflow is increased by directing the air through a path with limited capacity (cross-sectional area). The larger path opens when the load increases so that a greater amount of air can enter the chamber. In dual overhead cam (DOHC) designs, the air paths are often connected to separate intake valves so the shorter path can be excluded by deactivating the intake valve itself.
* Pressurization: A tuned intake path can have a light pressurizing effect similar to a low-pressure supercharger due to Helmholtz resonance. However, this effect occurs only over a narrow engine speed range which is directly influenced by intake length. A variable intake can create two or more pressurized &quot;hot spots.&quot; When the intake air speed is higher, the dynamic pressure pushing the air (and/or mixture) inside the engine is increased. The dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the inlet air speed, so by making the passage narrower or longer the speed/dynamic pressure is increased.

Many automobile manufacturers use similar technology with different names. Another common term for this technology is variable resonance induction system (VRIS).

<text>The GE U36B is a four-axle B-B diesel-electric locomotive produced by General Electric from 1969 to 1974. It was primarily used by the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad and its successors, although thirteen provided the power for the original &quot;Auto Train&quot;. The U36B was the last GE high-horsepower universal series locomotive.

== Design ==
General Electric&#x27;s &quot;high-horsepower&quot; universal series locomotives were built around improvements to the 16-cylinder GE FDL-16 prime mover. The U36B, rated at , was the most powerful of the four-axle universal series and the last such design. It was visually indistinguishable from the GE U33B, both of which were long. The locomotives rode on Blomberg trucks from traded-in EMD general-purpose (GP) locomotives. Each locomotive weighed . The U36B shared large &quot;bat-wing&quot; radiators with other high-horsepower locomotives of its generation at the back.

The Seaboard locomotives had an 81:22 gear ratio, permitting a maximum speed of . The U36B and the six-axle GE U36C were designed to operate with the MATE (Motors for Additional Tractive Effort) slug. The MATE had four traction motors, allowing power from the locomotive to be distributed over a total of eight traction motors for double tractive effort. The Auto-Train locomotives did not have steam generators for passenger comfort; this was supplied by a separate steam generator car behind the locomotives.

== History ==
The primary purchaser of the U36B was the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, which ordered 108 locomotives. The Auto-Train Corporation, whose &quot;Auto Train&quot; ran primarily over the Seaboard, ordered another 17, for a total production run of 125. Four of these would be delivered to Conrail after Auto-Train ran into financial difficulties. The Conrail U36B locomotives were fitted with AAR Type B trucks. The unit price was $285,000. The intended use of the U36B was &quot;high-priority, fast freight services, such as intermodal trains.&quot;

GE manufactured the U36B between January 1969 and December 1974, during a period when railroads in the United States moved away from high-horsepower designs. There were multiple reasons for this change: rising fuel prices because of the 1973 oil crisis, higher locomotive maintenance costs, and poor wheel adhesion, resulting from the primitive state of wheel-slip control at the time. With its per axle, the U36B was the &quot;ultimate in adhesion-limited locomotives.&quot; GE would not market another such type until the Dash 7 series in the late 1970s.

Seaboard Coast Line #1776(2nd) (locomotive originally built as SCL #1813, it traded numbers with original #1776, which had already been released into service wearing the standard SCL Black with Yellow stripe paint scheme--1776(1st) became 1813(2nd and 1813(1st) became 1776(2nd)) was painted in a red-white-and-blue color scheme to honor the United States Bicentennial and made numerous special trips. The 13 Auto-Train locomotives were painted in that company&#x27;s distinctive purple-white-and-red color scheme, devised by Carol Settles. Amtrak leased car six of Auto-Train&#x27;s locomotives during the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977 to provide power for the Chicago–Florida &quot;Floridian&quot;.

== Preservation ==
• CSX/MCVX #7764 (ex-Seaboard Coast Line #1776) is preserved at the Lake Shore Railway Museum in North East, Pennsylvania. It is the only known surviving U36B.

==Original owners==
General Electric manufactured 125 locomotives between 1969–1975:

<text>Wilhelm Windelband (; ; 11 May 1848 – 22 October 1915) was a German philosopher of the Baden School.
==Biography==
Windelband was born the son of a Prussian official in Potsdam. He studied at Jena, Berlin, and Göttingen.

==Philosophical work==
Windelband is now mainly remembered for the terms &quot;nomothetic&quot; and &quot;idiographic&quot;, which he introduced. These have currency in psychology and other areas, though not necessarily in line with his original meanings. Windelband was a neo-Kantian who argued against other contemporary neo-Kantians, maintaining that &quot;to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him&quot;. Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system.

Windelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert. Windelband&#x27;s disciples were not only noted philosophers, but sociologists like Max Weber and theologians like Ernst Troeltsch and Albert Schweitzer.

==Bibliography==
The following works by Windelband are available in English translations:

<doc id="1183207" wikidata="Q77012" url="?curid=1183207" title="Heinrich Rickert">
<text>Heinrich John Rickert (; ; 25 May 1863 – 25 July 1936) was a German philosopher, one of the leading neo-Kantians.

==Life==
Rickert was born in Danzig, Prussia (now Gdańsk, Poland) to the journalist and later politician Heinrich Edwin Rickert and Annette née Stoddart. He was professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg, Germany (1894–1915) and Heidelberg (1915–1932), where he succeeded Windelband&#x27;s professorship (and Husserl succeeded Rickert&#x27;s professorship at Freiburg when it was vacated).

He died in Heidelberg, Germany.

==Philosophy==

He is known for his discussion of a qualitative distinction held to be made between historical and scientific facts. Contrary to philosophers like Nietzsche and Bergson, Rickert emphasized that values demand a distance from life, and that what Bergson, Dilthey or Simmel called &quot;vital values&quot; were not true values.

Rickert&#x27;s philosophy was an important influence on the work of sociologist Max Weber. Weber is said to have borrowed much of his methodology, including the concept of the ideal type, from Rickert&#x27;s work. Also, Martin Heidegger started out his academic career as Rickert&#x27;s assistant, graduated with him and then wrote his habilitation thesis under Rickert.

Charles R. Bambach writes:
Rickert, with Wilhelm Windelband, led the so-called Baden school of neo-Kantians.

<text>Second Lieutenant Donald Simpson Bell, VC (3 December 1890 – 10 July 1916) was an English school teacher and professional footballer. During World War I he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for actions during the Battle of the Somme in mid-1916, becoming the only English professional football player to be awarded the VC.

He attended St Peter&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and Harrogate Grammar School before going to Westminster College, London, to train as a teacher. A noted sportsman at college, he played as an amateur with Crystal Palace and later for Newcastle United. He returned to Harrogate and became a schoolteacher at Starbeck Council School (now Starbeck Primary School) and a member of the National Union of Teachers. To supplement his salary, in 1912 he signed professional forms with Bradford (Park Avenue). He played 6 games for the club as a defender or midfielder between 1912 and 1914.

When World War I broke out, he became the first professional footballer to enlist into the British Army – joining the West Yorkshire Regiment in 1915. He was promoted to Lance Corporal and then commissioned into the 9th Battalion, Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27; Own Yorkshire Regiment), going to France in November 1915. While on leave in June 1916 he married Rhoda Margaret before returning to the front. After being in reserve for the opening of the battle of the Somme, the 9th battalion were ordered into the front line on 5 July.

Bell was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 5 July 1916 at Horseshoe Trench, Somme, France.
Describing the deed in a letter to his parents, Bell stated that &quot;I must confess that it was the biggest fluke alive and I did nothing. I only chucked one bomb, but it did the trick&quot;. Bell was shot in the head by a sniper on 10 July 1916 while attacking a machine-gun post near the village of Contalmaison. He is buried at Gordon Dump Cemetery, near Albert. His Victoria Cross was formerly displayed at the Green Howards Museum in Richmond, Yorkshire. On 25 November 2010 it was auctioned by London medal specialists, Spink. It was purchased for a reported £210,000 by the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association and is on display at the National Football Museum in Manchester.

==Legacy==
On 9 July 2000, through the initiative of &quot;The Friends of the Green Howards Museum&quot;, General The Lord Dannatt, then Colonel of the regiment unveiled a memorial dedicated to Bell on the spot where he lost his life at Contalmaison, now known as Bell&#x27;s Redoubt. The event was covered by television and every year since then a small service has been held there. In 2010, the tenth anniversary of the unveiling was celebrated and in 2016, at Bell&#x27;s Redoubt, with a much improved memorial, there was scheduled to be a remembrance service on the hundredth anniversary of Bell&#x27;s heroism.. There is a memorial plaque to him in Wesley Methodist Church, Harrogate, where he was a Sunday School Teacher.

<doc id="1183212" wikidata="Q1408193" url="?curid=1183212" title="Ardy Lightfoot">
<text>is a platform game released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993 in Japan and 1994 in the west. It was developed by ASCII and published by Titus France in North America and Europe.

==Gameplay==
Ardy Lightfoot is a side-scrolling platform game where you can control title character anthropomorphic fox Ardy and his best friend, a blue creature named Pec, who can be used as a weapon, or can take the role of various other helpful devices like a hot air balloon or rock wall destroyer. If Ardy is hit by an enemy, Pec will disappear, and can only be retrieved by finding a chest. If Ardy is without his best friend, he can still attack by bouncing on his tail. He can also protect himself temporarily by hiding behind a clear mirror.

==Plot==
The sacred rainbow has shattered into seven crystal pieces, and it is up to Ardy to obtain them all. Whoever collects all seven crystal pieces will receive a wish. The evil King Visconti has already gotten one crystal piece, and he is searching for the other pieces. To this end, he sends out his followers, including Beecroft, Catry and many others. Ardy is assisted by friends along the way, like the unnamed elder, Nina, and a mysterious adventurer named Don Jacoby.

Although the ending screen says &quot;To be continued&quot;, no sequel was ever made.

== Development and release ==
When Titus published &quot;Ardy Lightfoot&quot; for North American audiences, several changes were introduced. These included numerous sprites, such as Ardy&#x27;s &quot;waiting&quot; pose, being removed; tied up and crying animals being removed from the background on the forest level; and in level 6, &quot;Eaten!&quot;, Catry&#x27;s gruesome death by acid was written out of the plot; instead of being reduced to a pile of bones, she is merely knocked unconscious.

== Reception ==
&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game for its huge levels, numerous character abilities, and impressive bosses, but warned prospective buyers that a great deal of patience is required, due to the game&#x27;s extremely high difficulty. They scored it a 7.2 out of 10. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a positive review, as well, citing the varied gameplay and cartoony and colorful graphics. &quot;Super Play&quot; gave the game an overall score of 83% praising the graphics, animation and sound.

<text>The Man Who Never Was is a 1956 British espionage thriller film produced by André Hakim and directed by Ronald Neame. It stars Clifton Webb and Gloria Grahame and features Robert Flemyng, Josephine Griffin and Stephen Boyd. It is based on the book of the same name by Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu and chronicles Operation Mincemeat, a 1943 British intelligence plan to deceive the Axis powers into thinking the Allied invasion of Sicily would take place elsewhere in the Mediterranean.

&quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, and Nigel Balchin&#x27;s screenplay won the BAFTA for that year.

==Plot==
In 1943, Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu (Clifton Webb) devises a scheme to deceive the Nazis about the impending invasion of Southern Europe. It entails releasing a corpse with a fictional identity off the coast of Spain, where strong currents will carry it ashore near where a known German agent operates. The non-existent Royal Marine courier, Major William Martin, would appear to be a plane crash victim carrying documents about an upcoming Allied invasion of German-occupied Greece, rather than Sicily, the more obvious target. Overcoming the reluctance of senior officers, Montagu receives Winston Churchill&#x27;s approval to execute his plan, known as Operation Mincemeat.

Following a medical expert&#x27;s advice, Montagu obtains the permission of the deceased&#x27;s father and procures the body of a man who died of pneumonia, which would give the appearance he had drowned. The corpse is placed in a canister packed with dry ice and transferred to a waiting submarine. The body is released off the Atlantic coast of Spain and washes ashore as intended. Local authorities, observed by German and British consulate staff, identify the body and conduct an autopsy. After the attaché case containing the deceptive documents is returned to London, a forensics expert confirms that the key letter, which describes an Allied invasion of Greece, has been cleverly opened, photographed and resealed.

Hitler is convinced the documents are genuine, though Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, is sceptical. The Germans dispatch to London an Irish spy, Patrick O&#x27;Reilly (Stephen Boyd), to investigate. O&#x27;Reilly investigates Martin&#x27;s American &quot;fiancée&quot;, Lucy Sherwood (Gloria Grahame), who is the flatmate of Montagu&#x27;s assistant, Pam (Josephine Griffin). O&#x27;Reilly arrives at their flat, posing as Martin&#x27;s old friend, on the same day Lucy has received news that her real boyfriend was killed in action. Her genuine grief mostly convinces O&#x27;Reilly.

As a final test, he gives Lucy his north London address, telling her to contact him if she needs anything. He then radios his German contacts that if he does not send another message in an hour he has been arrested. As Montagu, General Coburn (Michael Hordern) of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch and police officers are en route to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s flat, Montagu realizes why O&#x27;Reilly left his address with Lucy and persuades a reluctant Coburn to let O&#x27;Reilly go. When no one arrests him, O&#x27;Reilly sends a &quot;Martin genuine!&quot; radio message. The Germans then transfer most of their Sicily-based forces to Greece, which helps the Allied invasion of Sicily succeed.

After the war Montagu receives several decorations and awards for his wartime service, including the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He visits Spain and leaves his OBE medal at the grave of Major Martin, &quot;the man who never was&quot;.

==Historical accuracy==

Operation Mincemeat involved the acquisition and dressing up of a human cadaver as a &quot;Major William Martin, R.M.&quot; and using the submarine to put it into the sea near Huelva, Spain. Attached to the dead body was a briefcase containing fake letters falsely stating that the Allied attack would be against Sardinia and Greece rather than Sicily, the actual point of invasion. When the body was found, the Spanish Intelligence Service passed copies of the papers to the German Intelligence Service which passed them on to their High Command. The ruse was so successful that the Germans still believed that Sardinia and Greece were the intended objectives weeks after the landings in Sicily had begun.

The exact identity of the &quot;man who never was&quot; has been the centre of controversy since the end of the war. On the one hand, certain accounts claim the true identity of &quot;Major William Martin&quot; was a homeless, alcoholic rat-catcher from Aberbargoed, Wales, Glyndwr Michael, who had died by self-administering a small dose of rat poison.

However, in 2002, authors John and Noreen Steele published the non-fictional account of &quot;The Secrets of HMS Dasher&quot;, about an ill-fated escort carrier that exploded and sank in the Firth of Clyde around the time Operation Mincemeat had commenced. The Steeles argued that &quot;Major Martin&#x27;s&quot; body was actually that of seaman John Melville, one of the &quot;Dasher&#x27;s&quot; casualties. Further, it has been reported that the accuracy of this claim was verified by the Royal Navy in late October 2004, and a memorial service was held for Melville, in which he was celebrated as one whose &quot;memory lives on in the film &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; ... we are gathered here today to remember John Melville as a man who most certainly was.&quot; There is some circumstantial evidence that also supports the identity of the body used as being Melville&#x27;s, attested to as recently as 2022.

Alternatively, in 2010 professor Denis Smyth, a researcher at the University of Toronto, counter-argued that Glyndwr Michael was indeed the real &quot;Major Martin&quot;. To support his claims, Smyth published the contents of a secret memo and an official report, both authored by Ewen Montagu, confirming the Glyndwr Michael story.

Regardless of the identity of Major Martin, Nigel Balchin&#x27;s script stayed as close to the truth as was convenient, yet the film does fall back on some dramatization. For example, the episode of the Irish spy, O&#x27;Reilly, is a complete fabrication. The British Security Service controlled the German spy network in the UK with its Double-Cross System, though this fact was still secret at the time the film was made. Ewen Montagu declared that he was happy with the fictitious incidents which, although they did not happen, might have happened.

During filming, Montagu has a cameo role, that of a Royal Air Force air vice-marshal who has doubts about the feasibility of the proposed plan. It was described by Ben Macintyre as a &quot;surreal&quot; moment when the real Montagu addressed his fictional persona, played by Webb.

==Production==
The budget was £227,262 plus the fees of the story rights and producer Hakim and stars Webb and Graham.

==Reception==
The film earned an estimated $1.1 million in North American receipts in 1956.

The &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote, &quot;the picture may appear overly reverent by today&#x27;s standards. But this is still a crucial wartime spy tale that is well worth watching.&quot;

==&quot;The Goon Show&quot; parody==
The BBC&#x27;s radio comedy show &quot;The Goon Show&quot; made a send-up of the story of &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (based on the book) and incorporated most of the regular &quot;Goon Show&quot; characters. Written by Spike Milligan and Larry Stephens, the first version of the script formed two-thirds of the episode broadcast on 31 March 1953, before the film&#x27;s release, with the first third comprising a separate sketch. Like most of these early episodes, this no longer exists.

Milligan and Stephens later wrote a full-length version which was broadcast on 20 March 1956. Milligan later revised this script for the episode broadcast on 17 February 1958. Both of the later versions have been issued on CD sets. Peter Sellers (one of the Goons) provided the voice of Winston Churchill in the film, although the character did not appear in the &quot;Goon Show&quot; adaptation.

<text>Eric Norman Frankland Bell VC (28 August 1895 – 1 July 1916) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers during the First World War, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 1 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
Eric Norman Frankland Bell was born on 28 August 1895 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland, to Edward Bell and his wife Dora , one of four children. His father was an officer in the British Army&#x27;s Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, serving in Burma at the time of Eric&#x27;s birth. The battalion was later posted to Cheshire and the family moved to live in Warrington, where Bell attended school. They later moved to Liverpool and Bell completed his schooling and then went on to Liverpool University to study architecture under Sir Charles Reilly.

==First World War==
In August 1914, on the outbreak of the First World War, Bell volunteered for the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the regiment of the British Army in which his father was serving as adjutant of the 9th Battalion. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1914 and was posted to the regiment&#x27;s 6th Battalion. After a transfer to the 8th Battalion, he was assigned to the 9th Battalion. His two brothers, who had emigrated to the United States and Australia respectively, had also volunteered for the regiment.

The 9th Battalion was part of 109th Brigade, 36th (Ulster) Division, which was sent to the Western Front in France in October 1915. The following July, the division took part in the Battle of the Somme. By then, Bell had been promoted to temporary captain and was attached to the battalion&#x27;s light trench mortar battery. On 1 July 1916, the opening day of the battle, he was advancing with the infantry near the village of Thiepval towards the Thiepval Road and onto the objective, a redoubt held by German forces. When the advance in his sector was held up by a German machinegun, he made a solo foray to deal with the gunner. Further holdups were dealt with on his own through the use of trench mortar bombs. He was rallying leaderless troops when he was killed. His actions was posthumously recognised with an award of the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows:
Bell&#x27;s body was never recovered so he had no known grave. Instead, his name is listed on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing, which was established near Thiepval in Picardy. His brothers survived the war, although both had been wounded, and his parents died soon after the end of the war.

There are several memorials to Bell&#x27;s memory; he is listed on the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers memorial in Belfast, the King&#x27;s Garden Memorial in Bootle, and the War Memorial in Enniskillen. There is also a plaque on the former family home in Liverpool as well as a blue plaque on the house he was born in, 1 Alma Terrace, in Enniskillen.

==Victoria Cross==
King George V presented Bell&#x27;s VC to his father on 29 November 1916, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. The VC was later in the possession of his sister, who had emigrated in New Zealand in 1933. The sister also had possession of his 1914–15 Star but the whereabouts of his British War Medal and Victory Medal are not known. In 1999, a relative, Air Marshal Sir Richard Bolt, formerly New Zealand&#x27;s Chief of Defence Staff, offered the VC to the museum of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. It was presented to the museum in February 2001, where it is now displayed.

<doc id="1183227" wikidata="Q7384881" url="?curid=1183227" title="Ryde Pier">
<text>Ryde Pier is an early 19th century pier serving the town of Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. It is the world&#x27;s oldest seaside pleasure pier. Ryde Pier Head railway station is at the sea end of the pier, and Ryde Esplanade railway station at the land end, both served by Island Line trains.

== Before the pier ==
Before the pier was built, passengers had the uncomfortable experience of coming ashore on the back of a porter and then, depending on the state of the tide, having to walk as far as half a mile across wet sand before reaching the town. The need for a pier was obvious, especially if the town was to attract the wealthy and fashionable visitors who were beginning to patronise other seaside resorts.

== The original pier ==
The pier was designed by John Kent of Southampton. It was authorised by the (52 Geo. 3. c. cxcvi), and its foundation stone laid on 29 June 1813. The pier opened on 26 July 1814, with, as it still has, a timber-planked promenade. The structure was originally wholly timber and measured . By 1833, extensions took the overall length to . It is this pre-Victorian structure that has, with some modifications, carried pedestrians and vehicles ever since.

== Additions ==


A second &#x27;tramway&#x27; pier was built next to the first, opening on 29 August 1864. Horse-drawn trams took passengers from the pier head to the esplanade. The (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxlvi) authorised the Ryde Pier Company to extend the tramway to the Isle of Wight Railway&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Road station.

The &#x27; (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. ccciii) created the Ryde Station Company, and authorised the construction of a railway from the Isle of Wight Railway to St. John&#x27;s Road. The &#x27; (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. lix) and the (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. cxxxvi) combined the two schemes into a single extension of the tramway, and permitted conversion to mechanically-powered vehicles. The extension was abandoned a decade later following construction of the railway pier. From 1886 to 1927, the trams were powered by electricity from a third rail, and from then until 1969 were petrol-powered.

On 12 July 1880, a third pier was opened, alongside the first two, providing a direct steam railway link to the pier-head. It was severely damaged on 18 January 1881, when four ships, the &quot;Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Havelock&quot;, &quot;John Ward&quot; and &quot;Lucknow&quot;, were driven through it, destroying of the pier. The railway was part of the Portsmouth and Ryde Joint Railway (a company owned jointly by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and London and South Western Railway), as far as Ryde St John&#x27;s Road, to connect with their ship services to Portsmouth. However, trains were run by the independent Isle of Wight Railway and Isle of Wight Central Railway, who owned the tracks beyond St John&#x27;s Road and operated services to Ventnor and Cowes via Newport respectively.

In 1895, a concert pavilion was constructed at the pier-head, and over the next sixteen years, the original wooden piles were replaced with cast iron. It was at Ryde Pier that the Empress Eugénie landed from Sir John Burgoyne&#x27;s yacht &quot;The Gazelle&quot;, after her flight from Paris in 1870.

The Southern Railway Act 1924 (14 &amp; 15 Geo. 5. c. lxvi) transferred the undertaking of the Ryde Pier Company (the road and tramway piers) to the Southern Railway. The Southern Railway already owned the railway pier.

The pier head was remodelled in the 1930s using concrete, and during the Second World War was used for military purposes, after various modifications.

The concert pavilion was at the centre of the narrative in Philip Norman&#x27;s book, &quot;Babycham Night&quot;; the author&#x27;s family ran this venue when it was known as the Seagull Ballroom in the 1950s, and his relatives produced the eponymous perry. The pavilion was later demolished, but a few of the rotting piles are still visible around the edge of an extended car parking area constructed in 2010.

The tramway closed in 1969 and the structure was partially dismantled. This has left the disused and decaying tramway pier between the railway and promenade piers. The remaining structure has proved useful for temporary diversions, such as when a ship sliced through the promenade pier in 1974. In autumn 2010 the whole length was fitted with a temporary deck to provide a walkway, during re-building works on the Promenade Pier.

Ryde Pier was made a Grade II listed building in 1976. In the early 1980s, the road pier was transferred from British Rail to Sealink, and a modern waiting area, including some of the original buildings, replaced the original Victorian waiting rooms at the pier-head. Further modifications were made in 2009, including the provision of a conservatory-style refreshment area with views towards Ryde. In May 2011 the lighting columns on the Promenade Pier were fitted with Victorian-style brackets and lanterns.
The (SI 1991/107) transferred ownership of the road pier from Sealink Harbours Limited to Wightlink, and made Wightlink the harbour authority for the waters immediately surrounding the pier.
The (SI 2010/1900) gave Wightlink the power to make byelaws to regulate the use of the road pier.

== The pier today ==
The pier is still a gateway for passenger traffic to and from the Isle of Wight, with the Island Line train running from Ryde Pier Head railway station (at the pier head), via Ryde Esplanade down the eastern side of the island. The Wightlink catamaran runs regularly between Ryde and Portsmouth. It is possible to drive along the pier, and there is parking at the pier head. 

People are still allowed to walk along the pier but must contend with motor traffic driving along the same wooden walkway. From the pier head, there are panoramic views across the Solent to Portsmouth four miles away. On clear days, Fawley and its refinery can be seen away to the west.

In 2005, Ryde Pier featured briefly in the film &quot;Fragile&quot;, in an inaccurate scene where Calista Flockhart is driven along the pier after leaving a Red Funnel car ferry. In reality, the pier is only served by Wightlink craft, with Red Funnel services based out of Cowes and East Cowes, to the north-west.

From August 2010 to March 2011, Ryde Pier was closed to vehicles to allow structural repairs underneath the promenade pier, which had failed a regular inspection by Trant Engineering Limited (Mechanical, Electrical and Civil Engineers). The pier remained open to pedestrians, who from October 2010 used temporary decking on the tramway pier. Some Wightlink foot passengers were allowed to use Island Line train services along the pier free of charge. Work to extend the Pier Head to allow for additional car parking continued during this period. The promenade pier then re-opened.

On the weekend of 26 July 2014, the pier celebrated its 200th anniversary. Network Rail&#x27;s Strategic Route Plan in February 2018 warned that renewing the railway pier was &quot;unaffordable&quot; but failure to do so would be terminal to the operation of the railway, and as part of a wider programme to upgrade the Island Line have agreed to invest £5m into this project.

In 2020, as part of a wider regeneration of Ryde Esplanade train and bus station, a plan to reinstate the disused tramway pier as a pedestrian and cyclist route was announced with works due to be completed by the end of March 2023. Funding restrictions subsequently reduced the width of the new deck to 3m, which resulted in cyclist usage being eliminated from the plans. The tramway pier reopened in June 2023.

== Victoria Pier ==
For a few decades, Ryde had a second pier, the Victoria, a few hundred yards to the east. It was promoted by the Stokes Bay Pier and Railway Company to provide a landing for a rival ferry service from Gosport. It opened in 1864 as the main pier was getting its tramway. Being somewhat shorter than Ryde Pier, it could not be used at all points of the tide, and so offered little competition to the main Ryde to Portsmouth ferry services. When the Stokes Bay company was acquired by the London and South Western Railway in 1875, the ferry service ceased, and Victoria Pier became a pleasure pier only, with public baths at the head and a swimming platform at the dry end.

By 1900, the use of the bathing facilities was declining, and the second pier gradually became derelict. The austerity of the First World War led to it being considered redundant and a hazard, and in 1916, its demolition was authorised by act of Parliament. By the 1920s it had gone. Until the construction of the marina in the 1980s, the outline of the shore-end abutment could be made out in the sea wall near Ryde Pavilion, and at low spring tide, the stumps of the piles could be seen in the sand offshore.

== Pier Hotel ==
The Royal Pier Hotel was built soon after the original pier, to serve its increasing trade and traffic. It stood on Pier Street opposite the bottom of Union Street for a hundred years, becoming a well-known local landmark.

Its position across the end of the steep final section of Union Street created a difficult 90-degree turn for drivers. In 1930 a bus descending Union Street took the turn into Pier Street too fast and overturned, killing several passengers and pedestrians, and damaging the south front of the hotel. At the inquest, the Pier Hotel was found to be a hazard to drivers, and instead of being repaired its demolition was ordered. By 1931, the Pier Hotel and the entire range of buildings back to the end of St. Thomas&#x27;s Street had been removed, and Pier Street itself ceased to exist, becoming part of the Esplanade.

<text>A railway brake is a type of brake used on the cars of railway trains to enable deceleration, control acceleration (downhill) or to keep them immobile when parked. While the basic principle is similar to that on road vehicle usage, operational features are more complex because of the need to control multiple linked carriages and to be effective on vehicles left without a prime mover. Clasp brakes are one type of brakes historically used on trains.

== Early developments ==

In the earliest days of railways, braking technology was primitive. The first trains had brakes operative on the locomotive tender and on vehicles in the train, where &quot;porters&quot; or, in the United States brakemen, travelling for the purpose on those vehicles operated the brakes. Some railways fitted a special deep-noted brake whistle to locomotives to indicate to the porters the necessity to apply the brakes. All the brakes at this stage of development were applied by operation of a screw and linkage to brake blocks applied to wheel treads, and these brakes could be used when vehicles were parked. In the earliest times, the porters travelled in crude shelters outside the vehicles, but &quot;assistant guards&quot; who travelled inside passenger vehicles, and who had access to a brake wheel at their posts, supplanted them. The braking effort achievable was limited and it was also unreliable, as the application of brakes by guards depended upon their hearing and responding quickly to a whistle for brakes.

An early development was the application of a steam brake to locomotives, where boiler pressure could be applied to brake blocks on the locomotive wheels. As train speeds increased, it became essential to provide some more powerful braking system capable of instant application and release by the train operator, described as a &quot;continuous&quot; brake because it would be effective continuously along the length of the train.

In the United Kingdom, the Abbots Ripton rail accident in January 1876 was aggravated by the long stopping distances of express trains without continuous brakes, which – it became clear – in adverse conditions could considerably exceed those assumed when positioning signals. This had become apparent from the trials on railway brakes carried out at Newark in the previous year, to assist a Royal Commission then considering railway accidents. In the words of a contemporary railway official, these showed that under normal conditions it required a distance of 800 to 1200 yards to bring a train to rest when travelling at 45½ to 48½ mph, this being much below the ordinary travelling speed of the fastest express trains. Railway officials were not prepared for this result and the necessity for a great deal more brake power was at once admitted 
Trials conducted after Abbots Ripton reported the following for an express train roughly matching conditions involved (such as a 1 in 200 downward run, but not braking under favorable conditions):

However, there was no clear technical solution to the problem, because of the necessity of achieving a reasonably uniform rate of braking effort throughout a train, and because of the necessity to add and remove vehicles from the train at frequent points on the journey. (At these dates, unit trains were a rarity).

The chief types of solution were:

* A spring system: James Newall, carriage builder to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, in 1853 obtained a patent for a system whereby a rotating rod passing the length of the train was used to wind up the brake levers on each carriage against the force of conical springs carried in cylinders. The rod, mounted on the carriage roofs in rubber journals, was fitted with universal joints and short sliding sections to allow for compression of the buffers. The brakes were controlled from one end of the train. To release the brakes the guard wound up the rod to compress the springs, whereupon they were held off by a single ratchet under his control (although in an emergency the driver could draw on a cord to release the ratchet). When the ratchet was released the springs applied the brakes. If the train divided, the brakes were not held off by the ratchet in the guard&#x27;s compartment and the springs in each carriage forced the brakes onto the wheels. Excess play in the couplings limited the effectiveness of the device to about five carriages; additional guards and brake compartments were necessary if this number were exceeded. This apparatus was sold to a few companies and the system received recommendation from the Board of Trade. The L&amp;Y conducted a simultaneous trial with a similar system designed by another employee, Charles Fay, but little difference was found in their effectiveness. In Fay&#x27;s version, patented in 1856, the rods passed beneath the carriages and the direct spring application to each brake was given an intervening worm drive. The important &quot;automatic&quot; feature of Newall&#x27;s system was retained but the worm drive ensured that the brakes did not act too fiercely when released. It was Fay&#x27;s version of the system that the company entered for the Newark brake trials of June 1875, where a moderate performance, usually in the mid position of the eight systems on test, was achieved.
* The chain brake, in which a chain was connected continuously along the bottom of the train. When pulled tight, it activated a friction clutch that used the rotation of the wheels to tighten a brake system at that point; this system has severe limitations in length of train capable of being handled (as braking strength was considerably weaker after the third car), and of achieving good adjustment (give the slack that pin couplers required, which a fixed-length chain could not account for). In the United States, the chain brake was independently developed and patented by Lucious Stebbins of Hartford, Connecticut in 1848 and by William Loughridge of Weverton, Maryland in 1855. The British version was known as the Clark and Webb Brake, after John Clark, who developed it throughout the 1840s, and Francis William Webb, who perfected it in 1875. The chain brake remained in use until the 1870s in America and 1890s in the UK.
** The Heberlein brake is a notable variation on the chain brake popular in Germany, using an overhead cable instead of an underlinked chain.
* Hydraulic brakes. Actuating pressure to apply brakes was transmitted hydraulically (as with automobile brakes). These found some favour in the UK (e.g. with the Midland and Great Eastern Railways), but water was used as the hydraulic fluid and even in the UK &quot;Freezing possibilities told against the hydraulic brakes, though the Great Eastern Railway, which used them for a while, overcame this by the use of salt water&quot;

* The simple vacuum system. An ejector on the locomotive created a vacuum in a continuous pipe along the train, allowing the external air pressure to operate brake cylinders on every vehicle. This system was very cheap and effective, but it had the major weakness that it became inoperative if the train became divided or if the train pipe was ruptured.
* The automatic vacuum brake. This system was similar to the simple vacuum system, except that the creation of vacuum in the train pipe exhausted vacuum reservoirs on every vehicle and &quot;released&quot; the brakes. If the driver applied the brake, his driver&#x27;s brake valve admitted atmospheric air to the train pipe, and this atmospheric pressure applied the brakes against the vacuum in the vacuum reservoirs. Being an automatic brake, this system applies braking effort if the train becomes divided or if the train pipe is ruptured. Its disadvantage is that the large vacuum reservoirs were required on every vehicle, and their bulk and the rather complex mechanisms were seen as objectionable.
* The Westinghouse air brake system. In this system, air reservoirs are provided on every vehicle and the locomotive charges the train pipe with a positive air pressure, which releases the vehicle brakes and charges the air reservoirs on the vehicles. If the driver applies the brakes, his brake valve releases air from the train pipe, and triple valves at each vehicle detect the pressure loss and admit air from the air reservoirs to brake cylinders, applying the brakes. The Westinghouse system uses smaller air reservoirs and brake cylinders than the corresponding vacuum equipment, because a moderately high air pressure can be used. However, an air compressor is required to generate the compressed air and in the earlier days of railways, this required a large reciprocating steam air compressor, and this was regarded by many engineers as highly undesirable. A further drawback was the need to release the brake completely before it could be re-applied—initially there was no &quot;graduable release&quot; available and numerous accidents occurred while the brake power was temporarily unavailable.

Note: there are a number of variants and developments of all these systems.

The Newark trials showed the braking performance of the Westinghouse air-brakes to be distinctly superior: but for other reasons it was the vacuum system that was generally adopted on UK railways.
=== Later British practice ===
In British practice, only passenger trains were fitted with continuous brakes until about 1930; goods and mineral trains ran at slower speed and relied on the brake force from the locomotive and tender and the brake van—a heavy vehicle provided at the rear of the train and occupied by a guard.

Goods and mineral vehicles had hand brakes which were applied by a hand lever operated by staff on the ground. These hand brakes were used where necessary when vehicles were parked but also when trains were descending a steep gradient. The train stopped at the top of the gradient, and the guard walked forward to &quot;pin down&quot; the handles of the brakes, so the brakes were partially applied during the descent. Early goods vehicles had brake handles on one side only, but from about 1930 brake handles were required on both sides of good vehicles. Trains containing hand-braked vehicles were described as &quot;unfitted&quot;: they were in use in Britain until about 1985. From about 1930, semi-fitted trains were introduced, in which goods vehicles fitted with continuous brakes were marshalled next to the locomotive, giving sufficient braking power to run at higher speeds than unfitted trains. A trial in January 1952 saw a 52-wagon, 850 ton coal train run at an average of , compared to the usual maximum speed on the Midland main line of for unfitted freight trains. In 1952, 14% of open wagons, 55% of covered wagons and 80% of cattle trucks had vacuum brakes.

In the early days of diesel locomotives, a purpose-built brake tender was attached to the locomotive to increase braking effort when hauling unfitted trains. The brake tender was low, so that the driver could still see the line and signals ahead if the brake tender was propelled (pushed) ahead of the locomotive, which was often the case.

By 1878 there were over 105 patents in various countries for braking systems, most of which were not widely adopted.

==Continuous brakes==

As train loads, gradients and speeds increased, braking became a more significant problem. In the late 19th century, significantly better &quot;continuous brakes&quot; started to appear. The earliest type of continuous brake was the &quot;chain brake&quot; 
which used a chain, running the length of the train, to operate brakes on all vehicles simultaneously.

The chain brake was soon superseded by air-operated or vacuum operated brakes. These brakes used hoses connecting all the wagons of a train, so the operator could apply or release the brakes with a single valve in the locomotive.

These continuous brakes can be simple or automatic, the essential difference being what happens should the train break in two. With simple brakes, pressure is needed to apply the brakes, and all braking power is lost if the continuous hose is broken for any reason. Simple non-automatic brakes are thus useless when things really go wrong, as is shown with the Armagh rail disaster.

Automatic brakes on the other hand use the air or vacuum pressure to hold the brakes off against a reservoir carried on each vehicle, which applies the brakes if pressure/vacuum is lost in the train pipe. Automatic brakes are thus largely &quot;fail safe&quot;, though faulty closure of hose taps can lead to accidents such as the Gare de Lyon accident.

The standard Westinghouse Air Brake has the additional enhancement of a triple valve and a local reservoir on each wagon, enabling the brakes to be applied fully with only a slight reduction in air pressure, reducing the time that it takes to release the brakes as not all pressure is voided to the atmosphere.

Non-automatic brakes still have a role on engines and first few wagons, as they can be used to control the whole train without having to apply the automatic brakes.

==Types==

This is not a complete list of all railway brakes, but lists most of the common examples.

=== Mechanical brake ===
Most tractive units, passenger coaches and some freight wagons are equipped with a hand-operated parking brake (handbrake). This acts directly (mechanically) on the vehicle&#x27;s brake linkage. The activation of such a brake prevents wheel rotation independently of the pneumatic brake and is therefore suitable for securing parked wagons and coaches from unintentional movement. Only mechanical brakes can be used for this purpose, since the holding power of air brakes can decrease due to unavoidable leaks.

There are two types. The handbrake that can be operated on board the vehicle is used firstly to prevent it from rolling away and secondly to regulate the speed for certain shunting operations and to stop trains if the automatic brake fails. It is usually designed as a screw brake and is operated from a brakeman&#x27;s platform or, in the case of passenger coaches, from inside the coach, usually from an entrance area. On UIC freight wagons, this braking weight is framed in white (white like the rest of the brake inscription, alternatively black on a white or light-coloured background). Hand brakes on tenders and tank locomotives are often designed as counterweight brakes.

A manually operating parking brake is only suitable for securing static railway vehicles from rolling away. It can be designed as a hand wheel or as a spring-loaded brake.

A direction-dependent pawl brake is often installed in vehicles on rack railways. It only brakes when going downhill. When driving uphill, the applied ratchet brake is released by a ratchet mechanism and prevents the train from rolling backwards.

===Air and vacuum brakes===
In the early part of the 20th century, many British railways employed vacuum brakes rather than the railway air brakes used in much of the rest of the world. The main advantage of vacuum was that the vacuum can be created by a steam ejector with no moving parts (and which could be powered by the steam of a steam locomotive), whereas an air brake system requires a noisy and complicated compressor.

However, air brakes can be made much more effective than vacuum brakes for a given size of brake cylinder. An air brake compressor is usually capable of generating a pressure of vs only for vacuum. With a vacuum system, the maximum pressure differential is atmospheric pressure ( at sea level, less at altitude). Therefore, an air brake system can use a much smaller brake cylinder than a vacuum system to generate the same braking force. This advantage of air brakes increases at high altitude, e.g. Peru and Switzerland where today vacuum brakes are used by secondary railways. The much higher effectiveness of air brakes and the demise of the steam locomotive have seen the air brake become ubiquitous; however, vacuum braking is still in use in India, Argentina and South Africa, but this will be declining in near future. See &quot;Jane&#x27;s World Railways&quot;.

Visual differences between the two systems are shown by air brakes working off high pressure, with the air hoses at the ends of rolling stock having a small diameter; vacuum brakes work off low pressure, and the hoses at the ends of rolling stock are of a larger diameter. Air brakes at the outermost vehicles of a train are turned off using a tap. Vacuum brakes at the outermost vehicles of a train are sealed by fixed plugs (&quot;dummies&quot;) onto which the open end of the vacuum pipe is placed. It is sealed against a rubber washer by the vacuum, with a pin to hold the pipe in place when the vacuum drops during braking.

===Air brake enhancements===
One enhancement of the automatic air brake is to have a second air hose (the main reservoir or main line) along the train to recharge the air reservoirs on each wagon. This air pressure can also be used to operate loading and unloading doors on wheat wagons and coal and ballast wagons. On passenger coaches, the main reservoir pipe is also used to supply air to operate doors and air suspension.

===Counter-pressure brake===

The counter-pressure brake is a type of steam locomotive brake that brakes the locomotive using the driving cylinders. The brake works by using the cylinders as air compressors and converting kinetic energy into heat.

===Dynamic brake===

A common feature on electric and diesel-electric locomotives is the dynamic brake; this operates by using the electric motors that normally turn the wheels as an electric generator, thus slowing the train.

=== Eddy current brake ===

An eddy current brake slows or stops a train by generating eddy currents and thus dissipating its kinetic energy as heat.

=== Electropneumatic brakes ===
The higher performing EP brake uses a &quot;main reservoir pipe&quot; feeding air to all the brake reservoirs on the train, with the brake valves controlled electrically with a three-wire control circuit. If the wire is disconnected, the brakes automatically apply, so the fail-safe nature of other brake systems is retained. This provides between four and seven braking levels, depending on the class of train. It also allows for faster brake application, as the electrical control signal is propagated effectively instantly to all vehicles in the train, whereas the change in air pressure which activates the brakes in a conventional system can take several seconds or tens of seconds to propagate fully to the rear of the train. This system is not however used on freight trains due to cost. 

=== Electronically controlled pneumatic brakes ===

Electronically controlled pneumatic brakes (ECP) are an American development of the late 20th Century to deal with very long and heavy freight trains, and are a development of the EP brake with even higher level of control. In addition, information about the operation of the brakes on each wagon is returned to the driver&#x27;s control panel.

With ECP, a power and control line is installed from wagon to wagon from the front of the train to the rear. Electrical control signals are propagated effectively instantaneously, as opposed to changes in air pressure which propagate at a rather slow speed limited in practice by the resistance to air flow of the pipework, so that the brakes on all wagons can be applied simultaneously, or even from rear to front rather than from front to rear. This prevents wagons at the rear &quot;shoving&quot; wagons at the front, and results in reduced stopping distance and less equipment wear.

There are two brands of ECP brakes available in North America, one by New York Air Brake and the other by Wabtec. These two types are interchangeable.

=== Heberlein brake ===

A Heberlein brake is a continuous railway brake used in Germany that is applied by means of a mechanical cable. Train braking is therefore initiated centrally from the locomotive using a winder. This causes the brake clips to be applied on individual wagons, assisted by a servo system which makes use of the rotation of the axle. The brakes operate automatically if the cable snaps.

=== Steam brake ===

A steam brake is a type of brake for steam locomotives and their tenders, whereby a steam cylinder works directly on the brake linkages. 

== Reversibility ==

Brake connections between wagons may be simplified if wagons always point the same way. An exception would be made for locomotives which are often turned on turntables or triangles.

On the new Fortescue railway opened in 2008, wagons are operated in sets, although their direction changes at the balloon loop at the port. The ECP connections are on one side only and are unidirectional.

== Accidents with brakes ==

Defective or improperly-applied brakes may lead to a runaway train; in some instances this has caused train wrecks:
* Lac-Mégantic derailment, Quebec (2013), handbrakes were improperly set on unattended parked crude oil train, runaway tank cars rolled down a slope and derailed due to excessive speed on a curve in the centre of town, spilling of oil and causing fires which killed 47 people.
* Democratic Republic of the Congo west of Kananga (2007) – 100 killed.
* Igandu train disaster, Tanzania (2002) – runaway backwards – 281 killed.
* Tenga rail disaster, Mozambique (2002) – runaway backwards – 192 killed.
* San Bernardino train disaster, California (1989) – brakes failed on freight train which crashed into houses
* Gare de Lyon train accident, France (1988) – valve closed by mistake leading to runaway.
* Train no. 183 disaster, Vietnam (1982) – sabotaged breaks caused the train to flip near Bàu Cá station – more than 200 killed.
* Chester General rail crash, UK (1972) – brakes failed on fuel train which hit a parked DMU
* Chapel-en-le-Frith, Great Britain (1957) – broken steam pipe made it impossible for crew to apply brakes.
* Federal Express train wreck, Union station, Washington, DC, (1953) – valve closed by badly designed bufferplate.
* Torre del Bierzo rail disaster, Spain (1944) – brakes failed on overloaded passenger train which collided with another in a tunnel; a third train was unaware and also crashed into it.
* Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne derailment, France 1917 – runaway train on 3.3 percent grade, with air brakes on only 3 of 19 cars and on locomotive unable to keep train below authorized speed - 700 killed. 
* Armagh rail disaster, Northern Ireland (1889) – runaway backwards led to change in law.
* Shipton-on-Cherwell train crash, Oxford (1874) – caused by fracture of a carriage wheel.

<doc id="1183268" wikidata="Q6809932" url="?curid=1183268" title="Mei Foo Sun Chuen">
<text>Mei Foo Sun Chuen or simply Mei Foo is a large private housing estate in Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Mei Foo Sun Chuen was the first large scale private housing estate in Hong Kong and at the time of completion, the 99-tower complex was considered the largest private housing development in the world, accommodating some 70,000 – 80,000 people in 13,500 apartments. It is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s largest privately financed residential condominium projects.

==History==
The 40-acre Mei Foo Sun Chuen, with a total of ninety-nine blocks, was completed from 1968 to 1978 in eight separate but interconnected stages. It is located on the reclamation that had been a large petroleum-storage facility of Mobil (now part of ExxonMobil) in Hong Kong (Mobil&#x27;s Chinese trading name in Hong Kong is ; Mei Foo) from the 1920s. The redevelopment was carried out by Mei Foo Investments Limited, a subsidiary company of Mobil Oil (Hong Kong) Limited. The name, Mobil, was translated into 無比 ( mou 4 bei2) before the Sun Chuen (Estate) completed.

Mei Foo Sun Chuen was conceived to meet the housing needs of Hong Kong&#x27;s middle-income families, an emerging and growing group at the time. At the time, a flat in Mei Foo cost around HK$40,000.

When built, the estate was adjacent to the sea and to Lai Chi Kok Bay, with a waterfront walkway and flats with waterfront balconies. However, this changed due to the West Kowloon reclamation scheme (starting in 1990) and the estate now borders Lai Chi Kok Park.

==Buildings==
The residential complexes of Mei Foo were considered very affluent for the standards at the time they were built; every flat offers a balcony, at least two rooms and one bathroom. The apartment sizes vary from . Every apartment complex has a 24-hour uniformed, unarmed security force. Entry to a residential block requires a key card.

Mei Foo Sun Chuen has several schools, medical clinics, beauty salons, newspaper kiosks, supermarkets, shopping arcades, restaurants and food markets within its vicinity, making the area very convenient for residents. The private secondary schools in particular were notable for academically poor students. However, some schools have evolved into multicultural ones.

The once largest owners&#x27; corporation with legal status in Hong Kong, the Incorporated Owners of Mei Foo Sun Chuen – Stage I, was formed in 1997. The founder of the corporation, Yiu Chi-Wai, served as the Chairman of the Management Committee from 1997 to 2000. The other seven stages&#x27; owners&#x27; corporations were also formed during the period.

==Demographics==
In the 2016 by-census, the population of Mei Foo Sun Chuen was recorded as 37,303. The median age of the estate&#x27;s residents was 42.7.

==Transport==
Mei Foo is on the crossroad between Kowloon and Tsuen Wan. It is also considered part of the west border of urban Kowloon. Kwai Chung Road and Lai Chi Kok Bridge are the major roads in the area. A major bus terminus is located under the Kwai Chung Road underpass. serving as a terminus for multiple bus routes. The MTR rapid transit railway services Mei Foo station is connected to the Tsuen Wan line, completed in 1982, and to the Tuen Ma Line, operational since 2003. Alternate forms of public transport like minibuses and taxis also service the estate.

In 2009, the new Route 8 tunnels opened near Mei Foo, providing a much more direct road link to the eastern New Territories.

<doc id="1183269" wikidata="Q1500229" url="?curid=1183269" title="The History of Rome (Mommsen)">
<text>The History of Rome () is a multi-volume history of ancient Rome written by Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903). Originally published by Reimer &amp; Hirzel, Leipzig, as three volumes during 1854–1856, the work dealt with the Roman Republic. A subsequent book was issued which concerned the provinces of the Roman Empire. In 1992, a further book on the Empire, reconstructed from lecture notes, was published. The initial three volumes won widespread acclaim upon publication; indeed, &quot;The &quot;Roman History&quot; made Mommsen famous in a day.&quot; Still read and qualifiedly cited, it is the prolific Mommsen&#x27;s most well-known work. The work was specifically cited when Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize.

==Genesis==

Writing the &quot;History&quot; followed Mommsen&#x27;s earlier achievements in the study of ancient Rome. He had not himself designed to write a history, but the opportunity presented itself in 1850 while at the University of Leipzig where Mommsen was a thirty-two-year-old special Professor of Law. &quot;Invited to give a public lecture while at Leipzig, I delivered an address on the Gracchi. Reimer and Hirzel, the publishers, were present, and two days later they asked me to write a Roman History for their series.&quot; Having been dismissed from the University for revolutionary activities, Mommsen would accept the publishing proposal &quot;partly for my livelihood, and partly because the work greatly appeals to me.&quot;

The publishers specified that the work focus on events and circumstances, and avoid discussing the scholarly process. While they certainly wanted a well-respected academic work to fit their acclaimed series on history, Karl Reimer and Solomon Hirzel were also seeking one with literary merit that would be accessible and appeal to the educated public. As a scholar Mommsen was an active party in recent advances made in ancient Roman studies. Yet Mommsen also had some experience as a journalist. He might well manage to become a popular academic author. &quot;It is high time for such a work&quot;, Mommsen wrote to an associate in Roman studies, &quot;it is more than ever necessary to present to a wider audience the results of our researches.&quot;

==Publication==

===Original===

Originally the &quot;History&quot; was conceived as a five volume work, spanning Roman history from its inception to the emperor Diocletian (284–305). The first three volumes, which covered the origin of Rome through the fall of the Republic, ending with the reforms of Julius Caesar, were published in 1854, 1855, and 1856, as the &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot;.

These three volumes did indeed become very popular. &quot;Their success was immediate.&quot; Here &quot;a professional scholar&quot; presented his readers with a prose that was of &quot;such vigor and life, such grasp of detail combined with such vision, such self-confident mastery of a vast field of learning.&quot; Especially in Mommsen&#x27;s third volume, as the narrative told of how the political crisis in the Roman Republic came to its final climax, &quot;he wrote with a fire of imagination and emotion almost unknown in a professional history. Here was scientific learning with the stylistic vigor of a novel.&quot;

These first three volumes of the &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; retained their popularity in Germany, with eight editions being published in Mommsen&#x27;s lifetime. Following his death in 1903, an additional eight German editions have issued.

===Later volumes===

A planned fourth volume covering Roman history under the Empire was delayed pending Mommsen&#x27;s completion of a then 15-volume work on Roman inscriptions. This task required his services as researcher, writer, and editor, which occupied Mommsen for many years. After repeated delays the projected fourth volume was eventually abandoned, or at least not published; an early manuscript may have been lost in a fire.

Despite lacking a &quot;fourth volume&quot;, in 1885 Mommsen had ready another volume on ancient Roman history; it described the imperial provinces. In Germany this work was published as volume five of his &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot;. In thirteen chapters Mommsen discusses the different provinces of the Roman Empire, each as a stand-alone subject. Here there was no running narrative of political events, often dramatic, as was the case in Mommsen&#x27;s popular, chronological telling of the Roman Republic in his first three volumes. The English translation was entitled &quot;The Provinces of the Roman Empire from Caesar to Diocletion&quot;.

In 1992 a &#x27;reconstructed&#x27; edition of what would-have-been Mommsen&#x27;s missing &quot;fourth volume&quot; on the Empire was issued. It was based on newly discovered lecture notes by two of Mommsen&#x27;s students: Sebastian Hensel (father) and Paul Hensel (son). The two Hensels took notes of lectures on the politics of the Roman Empire delivered by Prof. Mommsen at the University of Berlin from 1882 to 1886. Alexander Demandt discovered them in 1980 at a used bookshop in Nuremberg. As edited by Barbara Demandt and Alexander Demandt, the notes yielded the &#x27;reconstructed&#x27; German text, &quot;Römische Kaisergeschichte&quot;.

===In English===

The contemporary English translations were the work of William Purdie Dickson, then the Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow. The first three German volumes (which contained five &#x27;books&#x27;) were published during 1862 to 1866 by R. Bentley &amp; Son, London. Over several decades Prof. Dickson prepared further English editions of this translation, keeping pace with Mommsen&#x27;s revisions in German. All told, close to a hundred editions and reprints of the English translation have been published.

In 1958 selections from the final two &#x27;books&#x27; of the three-volume &quot;History&quot; were prepared by Dero A. Saunders and John H. Collins for a shorter English version. The content was chosen to highlight Mommsen&#x27;s telling of the social-political struggles over several generations leading to the fall of the Republic. Provided with new annotations and a revised translation, the book presents an abridgment revealing the historical chronology. With rigor Mommsen is shown narrating the grave political drama and illuminating its implications; the book closes with his lengthy description of the new order of government adumbrated by Julius Caesar.

With regard to Mommsen&#x27;s 1885 &quot;fifth volume&quot; on the Roman provinces, Prof. Dr. Dickson immediate began to supervise its translation. In 1886 it appeared as &quot;The Provinces of the Roman Empire. From Caesar to Diocletian&quot;.

Mommsen&#x27;s missing fourth volume was reconstructed from student notes and published in 1992 under the title &quot;Römische Kaisergeschichte&quot;. It was soon translated into English by Clare Krojzl as &quot;A History of Rome under the Emperors&quot;.

==Review of contents==

===The Republic===
With exceptions, Mommsen in his &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; (1854–1856) narrates a straight chronology of historic events and circumstances. Often strongly worded, he carefully describes the political acts taken by the protagonists, demonstrates the immediate results, draws implications for the future, while shedding light on the evolving society that surround them. The chronology of the contents of his five &#x27;books&#x27; (in his first three volumes) are in brief:

* Book I, Roman origins and the Monarchy;
* Book II, the Republic until the Union of Italy;
* Book III, the Punic Wars and the East;
* Book IV, the Gracchi, Marius, Drusus, and Sulla;
* Book V, the Civil Wars and Julius Caesar.

The broad strokes of Mommsen&#x27;s long, sometimes intense narrative of the Roman Republic were summarized at the 1902 award of the Nobel Prize in a speech given by the secretary of the Swedish Academy. At the beginning, the strength of Rome derived from the health of its families, e.g., a Roman&#x27;s obedience to the state was associated with obedience of son to father. From here Mommsen skillfully unrolls the huge canvas of Rome&#x27;s long development from rural town to world capital. An early source of stability and effectiveness was the stubbornly preserved constitution; e.g., the reformed Senate composed of patricians and plebeians generally handled public affairs of the city-state in an honorable manner.

Yet the great expansion of Rome and the consequent transformations worked to subvert the ancient order. Gradually, older institutions grew incapable of effectively meeting new and challenging circumstances, of performing the required civic tasks. The purported sovereignty of the comitia (people&#x27;s assembly) became only a fiction, which might be exploited by demagogues for their own purposes. In the Senate, the old aristocratic oligarchy began to become corrupted by the enormous wealth derived from military conquest and its aftermath; it no longer served well its functional purpose, it failed to meet new demands placed on Rome, and its members would selfishly seek to preserve inherited prerogatives against legitimate challenge and transition. A frequently unpatriotic capitalism abused its power in politics and by irresponsible speculation. The free peasantry became squeezed by the competing demands of powerful interests; accordingly its numbers began to dwindle, which eventually led to a restructuring of Army recruitment, and later resulted in disastrous consequences for the entire commonwealth.

Moreover, the annual change of consuls (the two Roman chief executives) began to adversely impact the consistent management of its armed forces, and to weaken their effectiveness, especially in the era following the Punic Wars. Eventually it led to the prolongation of military commands in the field; hence, Roman army generals became increasingly independent, and they led soldiers personally loyal to them. These military leaders began to acquire the ability to rule better than the ineffective civil institutions. In short, the civil power&#x27;s political capabilities were not commensurate with the actual needs of the Roman state. As Rome&#x27;s strength and reach increased, the political situation developed in which an absolute command structure imposed by military leaders at the top might, in the long run, in many cases be more successful and cause less chaos and hardship to the citizenry than the corrupt and incompetent rule by the oligarchy of quarreling old families who &quot;de facto&quot; controlled the government. Such was his purpose when the conservative Optimate, the noble and Roman general Sulla (138–78), seized state power by military force; yet he sought without permanent success to restore the Senate nobility to its former power.

Political instability soon returned, social unrest being the disagreeable norm. The conservative renovation of the Republic&#x27;s institutions was abandoned and taken apart. Eventually the decisive civil war victory of the incomparable Julius Caesar (100–44), followed by his executive mastery and public-minded reforms, appeared as the necessary and welcome step forward toward resolution of the sorry and bloody débâcle at Rome. This, in the dramatic narrative of Theodore Mommsen.

Mommsen&#x27;s penultimate chapter provides an outline of the &#x27;nation building&#x27; program begun by Caesar following his victory. Institutions were reformed, the many regions ruled by Rome became more unified in design, as if prepared for a future Empire which would endure for centuries; this, during Caesar&#x27;s last five and a half years alive. His work at statecraft included the following: the slow pacification of party strife, nonetheless with republican opposition latent and episodically expressed; his assumption of the title Imperator (refusing the crown, yet continuing since 49 as dictator), with reversion of the Senate to an advisory council, and the popular comitia as a compliant legislature, although law might be made by his edicts alone; his assumption of authority over tax and treasury, over provincial governors, and over the capital; supreme jurisdiction (trial and appellate) over the continuing republican legal system, with the judex being selected among senators or equites, yet criminal courts remained corrupted by factional infighting; supreme command over the decayed Roman army, which was reorganized and which remained under civilian control; reform of government finance, of budgeting re income and expense, and of corn distribution; cultivation of civil peace in Rome by control of criminal &quot;clubs&quot;, by new city police, and by public building projects. Impossible problems: widespread slavery, disappearance of family farms, extravagance and immorality of the wealthy, dire poverty, speculation, debt; Caesar&#x27;s reforms: favoring families, against absentees, restricting luxuries, debt relief (but not cancellation as demanded by &quot;populares&quot;), personal bankruptcy for unpayable debt replacing enslavement by creditors, usury laws, road building, distribution of public agricultural lands in a moderated Gracchan fashion, and new municipal law. Mommsen writes, &quot;[W]e may well conclude that Caesar with his reforms came as near to the measure of what was possible as it was given to a statesman and a Roman to come.&quot;

Regarding the Roman provinces, former misrule and financial plundering is described, committed by Roman government agents and Roman merchants; Caesar&#x27;s reforms replaced the quasi-independent Roman governors with those selected by the Imperator and closely supervised, with reduction in taxes; provincial oppression by private concerns was found more difficult to arrest. Abatement of the prior popular notion of the provinces as &quot;country estates&quot; to be worked or exploited for Rome&#x27;s benefit. Favors granted Jews; Latin colonies continue. Cultural joining of Latins and Hellenes; &quot;Italy was converted from the mistress of subject peoples into the mother of the renovated Italo-Hellenic nation.&quot; Census of the Mediterranean population under Rome taken; popular religion left free of additional state norms. Continuing development of the Praetor&#x27;s Edict, and plans for a codification of law. Roman coinage, weights and measures reformed; creation of the Julian Calendar. &quot;The rapidity and self-precision with which the plan was executed prove that it had been long meditated thoroughly and all its parts settled in detail&quot;, Mommsen comments. &quot;[T]his was probably the meaning of the words which were heard to fall from him—that he had &#x27;lived enough&#x27;.&quot;

The exceptions to the straightforward chronology are the periodic digressions in his narrative, where Mommsen inserts separate chapters, each devoted to one or more of a range of particular subjects, for example:
* &quot;The Original Constitution of Rome&quot; (Book I, Chapter 5);
* &quot;The Etruscans&quot; (I, 9);
* &quot;Law and Justice&quot; (I, 11);
* &quot;Religion&quot; (I, 12);
* &quot;Agriculture, Trade, Commerce&quot; (I, 13);
* &quot;Measuring and Writing&quot; (I, 14);

* &quot;The Tribunate of the Plebs and the Decemvirate&quot; (Book II, Chapter 2);
* &quot;Law – Religion – Military System – Economic Condition – Nationality&quot; (II, 8);
* &quot;Art and Science&quot; (II, 9);
* &quot;Carthage&quot; (Book III, Chapter 1);
* &quot;The Government and the Governed&quot; (III, 11);
* &quot;The Management of Land and Capital&quot; (III, 12);
* &quot;Faith and Manners&quot; (III, 13);
* &quot;Literature and Art&quot; (III, 14);
* &quot;The Peoples of the North&quot; (Book IV, Chapter 5);
* &quot;The Commonwealth and its Economy&quot; (IV, 11);
* &quot;Nationality, Religion, Education&quot; (IV, 12);
* &quot;The Old Republic and the New Monarchy&quot; (Book V, Chapter 11);
* &quot;Religion, Culture, Literature, and Art&quot; (V, 12).

Mommsen&#x27;s expertise in Roman studies was acknowledged by his peers as being both wide and deep, e.g., his direction of the ancient Latin inscriptions project, his work on ancient dialects of Italy, the journal he began devoted to Roman coinage, his multivolume &quot;Staatsrecht&quot; on the long history of constitutional law at Rome, his volumes on Roman criminal law, the &quot;Strafrecht&quot;. His bibliography lists 1500 works.

===The Provinces===

The &quot;Provinces of the Roman Empire&quot; (1885, 1886) contains thirteen chapters, namely: Northern Italy, Spain, Gaul, Germany, Britain, the Danube, Greece, Asia Minor, the Euphrates and Parthia, Syria and the Nabataeans, Judaea, Egypt, and the Africa provinces. Generally, each chapter describes the economic geography of the region and its people, before addressing how the Imperial regime adapted to its peculiarities. Regarding the North, military administration is often stressed; while in the East, the focus is more on culture and history.

A quarter of the way into his short &quot;Introduction&quot; to the &quot;Provinces&quot; Mommsen comments on the decline of Rome, the capital city: &quot;The Roman state of this epoch resembles a mighty tree, the main stem of which, in the course of its decay, is surrounded by vigorous offshoots pushing their way upward.&quot; These shoots being the provinces he here describes.

===The Empire===

Mommsen&#x27;s missing fourth volume, as reconstructed by Barbara Demandt and Alexander Demandt from lecture notes, was published as &quot;Römische Kaisergeschichte&quot; in 1992. Thus appearing many years after third volume (1856), and the fifth (1885). It contains three sections of roughly equal size.

The first section is arranged chronologically by emperor: Augustus (44 BC-AD 14); Tiberius (14–37); Gaius Caligula (37–41); Claudius (41–54); Nero (54–68); The Year of Four Emperors (68–69); Vespasian (69–79).

The chapters of the second section are entitled: General Introduction; Domestic Politics I; Wars in the West; Wars on the Danube; Wars in the East; Domestic Politics II.

The third section: General Introduction; Government and Society; A History of Events [&quot;this the longest subsection, arranged by emperors&quot;]: Diocletian (284–305); Constantine (306–337); The sons of Constantine (337–361); Julian and Jovian (355–364); Valentinian and Valens (364–378); From Theodosius to Alaric (379–410).

This rescued work contains a great wealth of material, in which one follows in the footsteps of a master historian. Yet, perhaps because of its nature as reconstructed student lecture notes, it more often lacks the fine points of literary composition and style, and of course the narrative drive of the original three volumes. Nonetheless it is well to remember that the students involved here in taking the lecture notes were themselves quite accomplished people, and one listener and recorder was already a mature father.

==Roman portraits==

Several writers have remarked on Mommsen&#x27;s ability to interpret personality and character. The following highlights are drawn from Mommsen&#x27;s renderings of figures of ancient Rome, namely: Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, the Gracchi brothers, Marius, Drusus, Sulla, Pompey, Cato, Caesar, and Cicero.
* Hannibal (247–183). Of Carthage, not of Rome, in fact a sworn enemy of Rome, as the Roman people became acquainted with him. No Punic writer has left us an account of him, but only his &#x27;enemies&#x27; whether Greek or Roman. Mommsen tells us, &quot;the Romans charged him with cruelty, the Carthaginians with covetousness.&quot; It is &quot;true that he hated&quot; and knew &quot;how to hate&quot; and that &quot;a general who never fell short of money and stores can hardly have been less than covetous. But though anger and envy and meanness have written his history, they have not been able to mar the pure and noble image which it presents.&quot; His father Hamilcar served Carthage as an army general; Hannibal&#x27;s &quot;youth had been spent in the camp.&quot; As a boy on horseback he&#x27;d become &quot;a fearless rider at full speed.&quot; In his father&#x27;s army he had performed &quot;his first feats of arms under the paternal eye&quot;. In Hispania his father spent years building colonies for Carthage from which to attack Rome; but the son saw his father &quot;fall in battle by his side.&quot; Under his brother-in-law Hasdrubal, Hannibal led cavalry with bravery and brilliance; then Hasdrubal was assassinated. By &quot;the voice of his comrades&quot; Hannibal at 29 years took command of the army. &quot;[A]ll agree in this, that he combined in rare perfection discretion and enthusiasm, caution and energy.&quot; His &quot;inventive craftiness&quot; made him &quot;fond of taking singular and unexpected routes; ambushes and stratagems of all sorts were familiar to him.&quot; He carefully studied the Roman character. &quot;By an unrivalled system of espionage—he had regular spies even in Rome—he kept himself informed of the projects of his enemy.&quot; He was often seen in disguise. Yet nothing he did at war &quot;may not be justified under the circumstances, and according to the international law, of the times.&quot; &quot;The power which he wielded over men is shown by his incomparable control over an army of various nations and many tongues—an army which never in the worst of times mutinied against him.&quot; Following the war Hannibal the statesman served Carthage to reform the city-state&#x27;s constitution; later as an exile he exercised influence in the eastern Mediterranean. &quot;He was a great man; wherever he went, he riveted the eyes of all.&quot;
* Scipio Africanus (235–183). His father, a Roman general died at war in Hispania; years earlier his son Publius Cornelius Scipio (later Africanus) had saved his life. As then no one offered to succeed to his father&#x27;s post, the son offered himself. The people&#x27;s comitia accepted the son for the father, &quot;all this made a wonderful and indelible impression on the citizens and farmers of Rome.&quot; Publius Scipio &quot;himself enthusiastic&quot; about others, accordingly &quot;inspired enthusiasm.&quot; The Roman Senate acquiesqued to the mere military tribune serving in place of a praetor or consul, i.e., his father. &quot;He was not one of the few who by their energy and iron will constrain the world to adopt and to move in new paths for centuries, or who at any rate grasp the reins of destiny for years till its wheels roll over them.&quot; Though he won battles and conquered nations, and became a prominent statesman at Rome, he was not an Alexander or a Caesar. &quot;Yet a special charm lingers around the form of that graceful hero; it is surrounded, as if with a dazzling halo... in which Scipio with mingled credulity and adroitness always moved.&quot; His enthusiasm warmed the heart, but he did not forget the vulgar, nor fail to follow his calculations. &quot;[N]ot naïve enough to share the belief of the multitude in his inspirations... yet in secret thoroughly persuaded that he was a man specially favored of the gods.&quot; He would accept merely to be an ordinary king, but yet the Republic&#x27;s constitution applied even to heroes such as him. &quot;[S]o confident of his own greatness that he knew nothing of envy or of hatred, [he] courteously acknowledged other men&#x27;s merits, and compassionately forgave other men&#x27;s faults.&quot; After his war-ending victory over Hannibal at Zama, he was called &quot;Africanus&quot;. He was an excellent army officer, a refined diplomat, an accomplished speaker, combining Hellenic culture with Roman. &quot;He won the hearts of soldiers and of women, of his countrymen and of the Spaniards, of his rivals in the senate and of his greater Carthaginian antagonist. His name was soon on every one&#x27;s lips, and his was the star which seemed destined to bring victory and peace to his country.&quot; Yet his nature seemed to contain &quot;strange mixtures of genuine gold and glittering tinsel.&quot; It was said he set &quot;the fashion to the nobility in arogance, title-hunting, and client-making.&quot; In his politics Scipio Africanus &quot;sought support for his personal and almost dynastic opposition to the senate in the multitude.&quot; No demagogue, however, he remained content to merely be &quot;the first burgess of Rome&quot;.

* Tiberius Gracchus (163–133). His maternal grandfather was Scipio Africanus. His father Tiberius was twice consul, a powerful man at his death in 150. The young widow Cornelia &quot;a highly cultivated and notable woman&quot; declined marriage to an Egyptian king to raise her children. She was &quot;a highly cultivated and notable woman&quot;. Her eldest son Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus &quot;in all his relations and views... belonged to the Scipionic circle&quot; sharing its &quot;refined and thorough culture&quot; which was both &quot;Greek&quot; and &quot;Roman&quot;. Tiberius &quot;was of a good and moral disposition, of gentle aspect and quiet bearing, apparently fitted for anything rather than for an agitator of the masses.&quot; At that time political reform was widely discussed among aristocrats; yet the senate always avoided it. Tiberius declared for reform. Perhaps he was personally motivated by an incident as questor with the Army on campaign in Hispania: there he had escaped a terrible ordeal because of his elite connections. Reformist ideals of this &quot;young, upright and proud man&quot; were nourished by Hellenic rhetoricians. &quot;[W]hen his intentions became known... there was no want of approving voices, and many a public placard summoned the grandson of Africanus to think of the poor people and the deliverance of Italy.&quot; In 134 he became a tribune of the people. &quot;The fearful consequences of the previous misgovernment, the political, military, economic, and moral decay of the burgesses, were just at that time naked and open to the eyes of all. ... So Gracchus immediately after entering on office, proposed the enactment of an agrarian law.&quot; The land reform was to benefit small holders, to restore prosperity to the &quot;free farmers&quot; of Italy; it concerned rural state lands &quot;de facto&quot; long held in the possession of wealthy families both of Rome and of Latin allies. His proposed law seemed to garner senate support, but it was effectively vetoed by another tribune acting on behalf of powerful Roman landowners; twice his bill was vetoed. Tiberius Gracchus then turned to the people&#x27;s assembly, which deposed the offending tribune and itself passed the land reform law.

: &quot;Rome about this period was governed by the senate. Anyone who carried a measure of administration against the majority of the senate made a revolution. It was revolution against the spirit of the constitution, when Gracchus submitted the domain question to the people; and revolution also against... the tribunician veto.&quot; Too, the people&#x27;s assembly was a great tumultuous crowd and unfit to pass legislation. Yet senate governance had become so corrupt that a person who would replace it &quot;might benefit the commonwealth more than he injured it. ¶ But such a bold player Tiberius Gracchus was not. He was a tolerably capable, thoroughly well-meaning, conservative patriot, who simply did not know what he was doing.&quot; Angry aristocrats from the senate caught and clubbed to death Gracchus; 300 other reformers died with him. The senate then closed ranks, saying that Tiberius Gracchus &quot;had wished to seize the crown.&quot;

: Yet the land commission mandated by the reform law of Tiberius was allowed to meet and for several years managed to substantially increase the number of small farmers who owned their own land. Scipio Aemilianus (184–129), an in-law and adopted grandson of Scipio Africanus and thus cousin to the Gracchi, played an ambiguous rôle. A good soldier, fine orator, trustworthy, and known for steadfast probity, his politics put him in between the aristocracy and the reformers. Against the oligarchy he brought the ballot to criminal proceedings before popular tribunals. Yet he mostly opposed land reforms; &quot;rightly or wrongly, the remedy seemed to him worse than the disease.&quot; Eventually on behalf of allied Latin landowners he influenced the termination of the land commission. As a result he, too, was assassinated—probably by a land reformer.

* Gaius Gracchus (154–121). Gaius was the younger brother of Tiberius Gracchus, and the second son of Cornelia. Gaius set himself the project of reforming the constitutional order of the Senate and People of Rome.

: {Under construction}

* Gaius Marius (157–86). &quot;Son of a poor day-labourer&quot; in an Italian village, Marius was &quot;reared at the plough&quot;. He joined the army as soon as he could. Noted for his ability and fine appearance, he served during campaigns in Hispania and by age 23 became an officer. Back home, he planned an army career, but regardless of merit he &quot;could not attain those political offices, which alone led to the higher military posts, without wealth and without connections. The young officer acquired both by fortunate commercial speculations and by his union with a maiden of the ancient patrician clan of the Julii.&quot; In 115 he served as praetor and in 107 as consul. In Africa he then led an army; serving under him was Sulla, who captured Jugurtha which ended the war. Again Marius became consul, for an unprecedented four consecutive terms (104–101), during which in Germania he led an army to victory. &quot;[A] brave and upright man, who administered justice impartially&quot;, he was &quot;uncorruptable.&quot; &quot;[A] skillful organizer... an able general, who kept the soldier under discipline [and] at the same time won his affections... [Marius] looked the enemy boldly in the face and joined issue with him at the proper time.&quot; Not a man of &quot;eminent military capacity&quot;, he enjoyed &quot;the reputation for such capacity.&quot;

: &quot;[Marius took a place] of unparalelled honour among the consulars and the triumphators. But he was none the better fitted on that account for the brilliant circle. His voice remained harsh and loud, and his look wild, as if he still saw before him Libyans or Cimbrians, and not well-bred and perfumed colleagues. ... [H]is want of political culture was unpardonable... what was to be thought of a consul who was so ignorant of constitutional etiquette as to appear in triumphal costume in the senate! In other respects too the plebeian character clung to him. He was not merely—according to aristocratic phraseology—a poor man, but, what was worse, frugal, and a declared enemy of all bribery and corruption. After the manner of soldiers he was not nice, but was fond of his cups... he knew not the art of giving feasts, and kept a bad cook. It was likewise awkward that the consular understood nothing but Latin and declined conversation in Greek. ... Thus he remained throughout his life a countryman cast adrift among aristocrats.&quot;

: Marius, &quot;a farmer by birth and a soldier by inclination&quot;, started out as no revolutionary. Yet the &quot;hostile attacks of the aristocracy had no doubt driven him subsequently into the camp of [their] opponents&quot; where &quot;he speedily found himself elevated&quot; as the new popular leader. &quot;[T]he men of quality acknowledged his services&quot; in gaining crucial military victories. Yet &quot;with the people he was more popular than any one before or after him, popular alike by his virtues and by his faults, by his unaristocratic disinterestedness no less than by his boorish roughnesss; he was called by the multitude a third Romulus.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;the wretched government oppressed the land more heavily than did the barbarians.&quot; On Marius, &quot;the first man of Rome, the favorite of the people... devolved the task of once more delivering Rome.&quot; His &quot;sensuous passion&quot; was stirred. Yet to this rustic and soldier &quot;the political proceedings of the capital were strange and incongruous: he spoke ill as he commanded well.&quot; Firmer he was &quot;in the presence of lances and swords&quot; that amid &quot;applause and hisses&quot;. &quot;[I]f he would not deceive the expectations of his party&quot; and &quot;if he would not be unfaithful to his own sense of duty, he must check the maladministration of public affairs.&quot;

: Yet his efforts at social reform would end very badly. &quot;He knew neither the art of gaining his antagonists, nor that of keeping his own party in subjection.&quot; He stirred the proletariat to unworthy acts beyond the law; although he nobly shrank from the excess, he accepted the results. Once popular, a &quot;gallant man&quot;, he slowly came to be seen in a different light, as a &quot;laughing-stock&quot;. Later, during his seventh consulship in 86, many of his political opponents were murdered. &quot;He had taken vengeance on the whole genteel pack that embittered his victories and envenomed his defeats&quot;. Regretfully Marius at last emerged as &quot;the crackbrained chief of a reckless band of robbers&quot; which earned him &quot;the hatred of the entire nation&quot;.

* Livius Drusus (d.91). His father of the same name, acting as tribune but on behalf of the Senate, had sponsored rival programs and &quot;caused the overthrow of Gaius Gracchus.&quot; The son also held &quot;strictly conservative views.&quot; &quot;He belonged to the circle of the highest nobility and possessed a colossal fortune; in disposition too he was a genuine aristocrat—a man emphatically proud.&quot; Yet he followed &quot;the beautiful saying, that nobility implies obligation.&quot; He had in earnest turned away from the &quot;frivolity&quot; common to elite society. &quot;[T]rustworthy and strict in morals, he was respected rather than properly beloved&quot; by the common people, &quot;to whom his door and his purse were always open.&quot; Later he became tribune; as political events unfolded Drusus became less an antagonist and more the disciple of the late Gaius Gracchus. He championed reforms to remedy the corruption in the courts caused by equite merchants (who then acted as the judex); to this reform he added the grant of Roman citizenship to Italians. After the apparent victory of these reforms in the senate, followed by their repeal, while yet vigorous he was murdered. Following his death the Social War started throughout Italy over citizenship rights.

* Cornelius Sulla (158–78).

: {Under construction}

* Pompeius Magnus (106–48). His father was Pompeius Strabo, a consul who earned a triumph in the Social War. Pompey himself came into great public prominence during his 20s under the rule of Sulla. He was neither an &quot;unconditional adherent&quot; nor an &quot;open opponent&quot; of Sulla, who &quot;half in recognition, half in irony&quot; first called Pompey &#x27;the Great&#x27;. Sound in body and mind, a good athlete, a skilled rider and fencer, the youthful Pompey had won extraordinary military honors and public acclaim. &quot;Unhappily, his mental endowments by no means corresponded with these unprecedented successes. He was neither a bad nor an incapable man, but a man thoroughly ordinary.&quot; An &quot;excellent soldier&quot;, he was &quot;without trace of any higher gifts.&quot; As commander Pompey was cautious and delivered &quot;the decisive blow only when he had established an immense superiority&quot;. &quot;His integrity was of a rich man... too rich to incur special risks, or draw down on himself conspicuous disgrace&quot;. His reputation for &quot;integrity and disinterestness&quot; came less from his virtue than from a senate rife with vice. Yet as a landowner he was fair-minded; he did not join &quot;revolting schemes in which the grandess of that age&quot; expanded their domains by infringing on their &quot;humbler neighbors&quot;. A good man, &quot;he displayed attachment to his wife and children.&quot; He was &quot;the first to depart from the barbarous custom of putting to death the captive kings&quot; of countries fighting Rome. &quot;His &#x27;honest countenance&#x27; became almost proverbial.&quot; Yet at Sulla&#x27;s command Pompey quit his beloved wife and then later ordered the execution of soldiers loyal to him, all due to Sulla and politics. He was not cruel, but he was cold. A shy man, &quot;he spoke in public not without embarrassment; and generally was angular, stiff, and awkward in intercourse.&quot; &quot;For nothing was he less qualified than for a statesman.&quot; His aims uncertain, unable to decide on means, short sighted, &quot;he was wont to conceal his irresolution and indecision under a cloak of solemn silence.&quot; He often would &quot;deceive himself that he was deceiving others.&quot; Like Marius, &quot;Pompeius was in every respect incapable of leading and keeping together a [political] party.&quot;

: His exalted social position also remained fundamentally ambivalent. Allied to the aristocracy by his consular ancestry and through Sulla, he disliked Sulla personally and worked against the Sullan constitution, and his family gens was of recent vintage and not fully accepted by the nobility. Pompey maintained links to the Populares and joined Caesar in the triumvirate. Yet, to the contrary, he was well suited to associate with the senate oligarchy because his &quot;dignified outward appearance, his solemn formality, his personal bravery, his decorous private life, his want of all initiative&quot; and his &quot;mediocrity, so characteristic of the genuine Optimate&quot;. An &quot;affinity&quot; existed, &quot;subsisted at all times between Pompeius, [the] burgesses and the senate.&quot; Pompeius, however, refused to fit in. &quot;[S]eized with giddiness on the height of glory which he had climbed with dangerous rapidity and ease&quot;, he began to compare himself to Alexander the Great, and far above any senator. &quot;His political position was utterly perverse.&quot; He was conflicted; &quot;deeply indignant when persons and laws did not bend unconditionally before him&quot; he nonetheless &quot;trembled at the mere thought of doing anything unconstitutional.&quot; His &quot;much agitated life passed joylessly away in a perpetual inward contradiction.&quot; Pompey for Mommsen was the &quot;most tiresome and most starched of all artificial great men.&quot; He died before his wife and son, when one of his old soldiers stabbed him from behind as he stepped ashore in Egypt. &quot;Of all pitiful parts there is none more pitiful than that of passing for more than one really is.&quot;

* Cato Uticensis (95–46). His mother&#x27;s brother was the reformer Livius Drusus. His father&#x27;s grandfather was the famous censor, Cato the Elder (234–149). Here, Cato (also called &#x27;the Younger&#x27;) was a rare man among the aristocracy, &quot;a man of the best intentions and of rare devotedness&quot;, yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached &quot;to country and to its hereditary constitution&quot; he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, &quot;dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion&quot;, might have made &quot;a tolerable state accountant.&quot; Walking &quot;in the sinful capital as a model citizen and mirror of virtue&quot; he would &#x27;scold&#x27; those out of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics &quot;his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily hit the nail on the head.&quot; The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a &quot;strange caricature&quot; of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the Stoa, the younger Cato would speak in &quot;scholastic wisdom&quot; and appeared as &quot;this cloud-walker in the realm of abstract morals.&quot; Yet like his ancestor, he began &quot;to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no interest, to decline badges of distinction as a soldier&quot;, and like the legendary king Romulus to appear shirtless. In &quot;an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude.&quot; As &quot;the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the Optimate party.&quot; He never missed a senate meeting, and &quot;as long as he lived he checked the details of the public budget.&quot; Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato&#x27;s tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than &quot;setting his face against every one who deviated&quot; from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this &quot;Don Quixote of the aristocracy&quot; proved the exhaustion of senate politics.

: After Caesar&#x27;s victory at Thapsus ending the civil war, Cato tended to the welfare of the republican remnant at Utica, then took his own life by the sword. &quot;Cato was anything but a great man.&quot; Yet he was the only man who &quot;honourably and courageously championed in the last struggle the great republican system doomed to destruction.&quot; &quot;Cato has played a greater part in history than many men far superior to him in intellect. It only heightens the deep and tragic significance of his death that he was himself a fool; in truth it is just because Don Quixote is a fool that he is a tragic figure.&quot; Yet Cato inspired the republican protest against Caesar&#x27;s victory, which &quot;tore asunder like gossamer all that so-called constitutional character with which Caesar invested his monarchy&quot;, and exposed as hypocritical &quot;the reconciliation of all parties&quot; under the Empire. &quot;The unrelenting warfare which the ghost of the legitimate republic waged for centuries&quot; against the Empire, from Cassius and Brutus to Thrasea and Tacitus, &quot;a warfare of plots and of literature&quot; was Cato&#x27;s legacy. Soon after his death this &quot;republican opposition&quot; began to &quot;revere as a saint&quot; Cato who in life was frequently a &quot;laughing-stock&quot; and a &quot;scandal&quot;. &quot;But the greatest of these marks of respect was the involuntary homage which Caesar rendered to him, when he made an exception in the contemptuous clemency&quot; he offered defeated opponents. Cato alone he pursued even beyond the grave &quot;with that energetic hatred which practical statesmen are wont to feel toward antagonists opposing them from a region of ideas which they regard as equally dangerous and impracticable.&quot;

* Gaius Julius Caesar (100–44),

: {Under construction}

* Tullius Cicero (106–43). An opportunist, &quot;accostomed to flirt at times with the democrats, at times... with the aristocracy, and to lend his services as an advocate to every influential man under impeachment without distinction of person or party&quot;. Wealth and commerce were then &quot;dominant in the courts&quot; and the lawyer Cicero had made himself well accomplished as &quot;the eloquent pleader&quot; and &quot;the courtly and witty champion.&quot; He was not an aristocrat, but a novus homo; he belonged to no party, but cultivated connections enough among both optimates and populares. Elected consul in 63, he ducked legal responsibility in the Catilina conspiracy. &quot;As a statesman without insight, idea, or purpose, Cicero figured successively as democrat, as aristocrat, and as a tool of the triumvirate, and was never more than a short-sighted egoist.&quot; &quot;He was valiant in opposition to sham attacks, and he knocked down many walls of pasteboard with a loud din; no serious matter was ever, either in good or evil, decided by him&quot;. In Latin, &quot;his importance rests on his mastery of style&quot;. Yet as an author, he was &quot;a dabbler&quot;, a &quot;journalist in the worst sense of that term&quot;, and &quot;poor beyond all conception in ideas&quot;. His letters &quot;reflect the urban or villa life of the world of quality&quot; yet remain in essence &quot;stale and empty&quot;. As an orator &quot;Cicero had no conviction and no passion; he was nothing but an advocate&quot;. He published his court pleadings; his orations can be &quot;easy and agreeable reading.&quot; He used anecdote to excite sentimentality, &quot;to enliven the dry business&quot; of law &quot;by cleverness or witticisms mostly of a personal sort&quot;. Yet &quot;the serious judge&quot; will find such &quot;advantages of a very dubious value&quot; considering his &quot;want of political discernment in the orations on constitutional questions and of juristic deduction in the forensic addresses, the egotism forgetful of its duty... [and] the dreadful barrenness of thought&quot;. Yet as a &quot;mouthpiece&quot; for politicians Cicero &quot;was useful on account of his lawyer&#x27;s talent of finding a reason, or at any rate words, for everything.&quot;

: Nonetheless Momsen acknowledges that those works of Cicero which are presented in the &quot;stylistic dialogue&quot; form are &quot;not devoid of merit&quot;. &quot;De Oratore&quot; and other rhetorical writings contain &quot;a store of practical forensic experience and forensic anecdotes of all sorts easily and tastefully set forth, and in fact solve the problem of combining didactic instruction with amusement.&quot; Cicero&#x27;s treatise &quot;De Republica&quot; presents a then popular idea &quot;that the existing constitution of Rome is substantially the ideal state-organisation sought for by the philosophers.&quot; Yet it is &quot;a singular mongrel compound of history and philosophy.&quot; Relying on the Greeks for both ideas and literary devices, &quot;De Republica&quot; contains &quot;comparative originality, inasmuch as the elaboration shows throughout Roman local colouring, and the proud consciousness of political life, which the Roman was certainly entitled to feel as compared with the Greeks.&quot; In these dialogues Cicero&#x27;s fictional advocates are shown gathered, including statesmen from the &quot;Scipionic&quot; circle, which &quot;furnish a lively and effective framework... for the scientific discussion.&quot;

==Commentary I==
Writers have described Mommsen&#x27;s history as transformative of prior works on ancient Rome. He employed new sources, e.g., ancient inscriptions, in order to gain new insights. He also wrote in a new fashion. Yet his point of view itself was new, a product of his own life and times, a 19th-century outlook from middle Europe. From the vantage point of our latter era, the 19th-century view presents a result that appears now as somewhat of a distortion. On the other hand, each individual&#x27;s outlook will necessarily encompass unique insights.

===New sources===

Mommsen followed by a generation the historian Barthold Niebuhr, who had made significant advances in Roman studies. Niebuhr elevated the standards of scholarship and, in doing so, brought to light the lack of rigor of earlier work. He insisted on investigating the original sources. By his perceptive questioning, he challenged the surviving Latin and Greek historical literature, especially regarding earliest Rome. Niebuhr sifted it carefully in order to separate out what genuinely reflected the actual events: stories sourced in persons with personal knowledge, as opposed to inventions created apart from the event and containing suspect information, e.g., legend or folktales thoroughly scrambled with myth and fiction. He relied in part on the emerging field of source criticism to shed new light on the old writings. Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; was highly praised.

Yet Mommsen outdid Niebuhr. Mommsen sought to create a new category of material evidence on which to build an account of Roman history, i.e., in addition to the literature and art. Of chief importance were the many surviving Latin inscriptions, often on stone or metal. Also included were the Roman ruins, and the various Roman artefacts ranging from pottery and textiles, to tools and weapons. Mommsen encouraged the systematic investigation of these new sources, combined with on-going developments in philology and legal history. Much on-going work was furthering this program: inscriptions were being gathered and authenticated, site work performed at the ruins, and technical examination make of the objects. From a coordinated synthesis of these miscellaneous studies, historical models might be constructed. Such modeling would provide historians with an objective framework independent of the ancient texts, by which to determine their reliability. Information found in the surviving literature then could be for the first time properly scrutinized for its truth value and accordingly appraised.

&quot;[T]hrough comparative linguistics, numismatics, and epigraphy, Mommsen was trying to create a body of material which had the status of archival evidence and which would serve as a control on the narratives of historical writers such as Livy and Appian. Their narratives had already been subjected to scrutiny by earlier scholars, of whom the most significant was Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776–1831). ... Niebuhr&#x27;s method had been to apply the principles of &quot;Source Criticism&quot; to unravel contradictions in the traditional account, and then to explain them by applying models developed in the light of his own experience, e.g., of conscription in a peasant society. Mommsen&#x27;s work sought to establish entirely new categories of evidence for the use of the historian.&quot;

The Mommsen&#x27;s work won immediate, widespread acclaim, but the praise it drew was not unanimous. &quot;While the public welcomed the book with delight and scholars testified to its impeccable erudition, some specialists were annoyed at finding old hypotheses rejected... .&quot; Mommsen omits much of the foundation legends and other tales of early Rome, because he could find no independent evidence to verify them. He thus ignored a scholarly field that was seeking a harmonized view using merely ancient writers. Instead Mommsen&#x27;s &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; presented only events from surviving literature that could be somehow checked against other knowledge gained elsewhere, e.g., from inscriptions, philology, or archaeology.

&quot;[The book] astonished and shocked professional scholars by its revolutionary treatment of the misty beginnings of Rome, sweeping away the old legends of the kings and heroes and along with them the elaborate critical structure deduced from those tales by Barthold Niebuhr, whose reputation as the grand master of Roman history was then sacrosanct. It replaced the critical work of Niebuhr with a far more penetrating criticism and a profounder body of inference.&quot;

Work continues, of course, in the trans-generational endeavor of moderns to understand what can legitimately be understood from what is left of the ancient world, including the works of the ancient historians. To be self-aware of how the approach ancient evidence, of course, is included in the challenge.

===Novel style===
There were academics who disapproved of its tone. &quot;It was indeed the work of a politician and journalist as well as of a scholar.&quot; Before writing the &quot;History&quot;, Mommsen had participated in events during the unrest of 1848 in Germany, a year of European-wide revolts; he had worked editing a periodical which involved politics. Later Mommsen became a member of the Prussian legislature and eventually of the Reichstag. Mommsen&#x27;s transparent comparison of ancient to modern politics is said to distort, his terse style to be journalistic, i.e., not up to the standard to be achieved by the professional academic.

About his modernist tone, Mommsen wrote: &quot;I wanted to bring down the ancients from the fantastic pedestal on which they appear into the real world. That is why the consul had to become the burgomaster.&quot; As to his partisanship, Mommsen replied: &quot;Those who have lived through historical events... see that history is neither written nor made without love and hate.&quot; To the challenge that he favored the political career of Julius Caesar, Mommsen referred to the corruption and dysfunction of the tottering Republic: &quot;When a Government cannot govern, it ceases to be legitimate, and he who has the power to overthrow it has also the right.&quot; He further clarified, stating the Caesar&#x27;s role must be considered as the lesser of two evils. As an organism is better than a machine &quot;so is every imperfect constitution which gives room for the free self-determination of a majority of citizens infinitely [better] than the most humane and wonderful absolutism; for one is living, and the other is dead.&quot; Thus, the Empire would only hold together a tree without sap.

===Roman parties===

&quot;In only one important aspect&quot;, Saunders and Collins hold, &quot;did Mommsen fall into serious error.&quot; They note that &#x27;most&#x27; scholars have faulted Mommsen for his depiction of the Roman party system during the late Republic. They readily admit that the Senate was dominated by a hardcore of &#x27;aristocrats&#x27; or the &#x27;oligarchy&#x27;, who also nearly monopolized the chief offices of government, e.g., consul, by means of family connection, marriage alliance, wealth, or corruption. Such &quot;men may be said to have formed a &#x27;party&#x27; in the sense that they had at least a common outlook—stubborn conservatism.&quot; They contended vainly among themselves for state &#x27;honors&#x27; and personal greed, &quot;forming cliques and intrigues in what amounted to a private game&quot;. Such Senate &#x27;misrule&#x27; subverted Rome, causing prolonged wrongs and injustice that &quot;aroused sporadic and sometimes massive and desperate opposition. But the opposition was never organized into a party. ... [T]here was no clear political tradition running from the Gracchi through Marius to Caesar.&quot;

The classicist Lily Ross Taylor addresses this issue, as follows. Cicero, to refer to these two rival political groups, continually used the Latin word &quot;partes&quot; [English &quot;parties&quot;]. Cicero (106–43) was a key figure in Roman politics who wrote volumes about it. In distinguishing the two groups, he employed the Latin terms &quot;optimates&quot; for proponents of the Senate nobility and &quot;populares&quot; for elite proponents of the popular demos or commoners. She points to the Roman historians Sallust (86–34) and Livy (59 BC-AD 17) for partial confirmation, as well as to later writers Plutarch (c.46–120), Appian (c.95-c.165), and Dio (c.155-c.235), and later still Machiavelli (1469–1527).

These rival political groups, Prof. Taylor states, were quite amorphous, as Mommsen well knew. In fact when Mommsen wrote his &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; (1854–1856) political parties in Europe and America were also generally amorphous, being comparatively unorganized and unfocused, absent member allegiance and often lacking programs. Yet in the 20th century modern parties grew better organized with enduring policies, so that their comparison with ancient Rome has become more and more tenuous. She describes Mommsen:

&quot;Theodor Mommsen... presented party politics of the late [Roman] republic in terms of the strife of his own day between liberalism and the reaction that won the battle in 1848. Mommsen identified the Roman &quot;optimates&quot; with the hated Prussian Junkers and aligned himself with Caesar against them. But he fully recognized the lack of principle or program among the &quot;populares&quot;. He well understood the amorphous character of the Roman &#x27;parties&#x27;. The parties that he knew in Prussia and in other German states were almost equally amorphous.&quot;

As Prof. Taylor continues, since Mommsen&#x27;s wrote modern party &#x27;tickets&#x27; and party &#x27;lines&#x27; have grown more disciplined, and &quot;the meaning of party had undergone a radical change. Thus the terms &#x27;optimate&#x27; and &#x27;popular&#x27; party are misleading to the modern reader. [¶] Lately there has been protest against the attribution of parties to Rome. The protest has gone too far.&quot; That is, the above-stated divisions were strong and constellated politics during the last century of the Roman Republic.

===Revolution(s)===

In 1961 the British historian Edward Hallett Carr published his &quot;What is History?&quot;, which became well known. Therein Carr conjectured that the very nature of writing history will cause historians as a whole to reveal themselves to their readers as &#x27;prisoners&#x27; subject to the context of their own age and culture. As a consequence, one may add, every generation feels the need to rewrite history so that it better fits their own situation, their point of view. To illustrate his point here, Carr selected as exemplars a number of well-regarded historians, among them being Theodore Mommsen.

Accordingly, Carr informs us that Mommsen&#x27;s multivolume work &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot; (Leipzig 1854–1856) may tell the perceptive modern historian much about mid-19th-century Germany, while it is presenting an account of ancient Rome. A major recent event in Germany was the failure of the 1848–1849 Revolution, while in Mommsen&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; his narration of the Republic draws to a close with the revolutionary emergence of a strong state executive in the figure of Julius Caesar. Carr conjectures as follows.

&quot;Mommsen was imbued with the sense of need for a strong man to clean up the mess left by the failure of the German people to realize its political aspirations; and we shall never appreciate its history at its true value until we realize that his well-known idealization of Caesar is the product of this yearning for the strong man to save Germany from ruin, and that the lawyer-politician Cicero, that ineffective chatterbox and slippery procrastinator, has walked straight out of the debates of the Paulikirche in Frankfurt in 1848.&quot;

Far from protesting or denying such an observation, Mommsen himself readily admitted it. He added, &quot;I wanted to bring down the ancient from their fantastic pedestal on which they appear in the real world. That is why the consul had to become the burgomaster. Perhaps I have overdone it; but my intention was sound enough.&quot;

Alongside Carr on Mommsen, Carr likewise approaches George Grote&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot; (1846–1856) and states that it must also reveal that period&#x27;s England as well as ancient Greece. Thus about Grote&#x27;s book Carr conjectures.

&quot;Grote, an enlightened radical banker writing in the 1840s, embodied the aspirations of the rising and politically progressive British middle class in an idealized picture of Athenian democracy, in which Pericles figured as a Benthamite reformer, and Athens acquired an empire in a fit of absence of mind. It may not be fanciful to suggest that Grote&#x27;s neglect of the problem of slavery in Athens reflected the failure of the group in which he belonged to face the problem of the new English factory working class.

&quot;I should not think it an outrageous paradox&quot;, writes Carr, &quot;if someone were to say that Grote&#x27;s &quot;History of Greece&quot; has quite as much to tell us about the thought of the English philosophical radicals in the 1840s as about Athenian democracy in the fifth century B.C.&quot; Prof. Carr credits the philosopher R. G. Collingwood as being his inspiration for this line of thinking.

Robin Collingwood, an early 20th-century Oxford professor, worked at building a philosophy of history, wherein history would remain a sovereign discipline. In pursuing this project he studied extensively the Italian philosopher and historian Benedetto Croce (1866–1952). Collingwood wrote on Croce, here in his 1921 essay.

&quot;Croce shows how Herodotus, Livy, Tacitus, Grote, Mommsen, Thierry, and so forth, all wrote from a subjective point of view, wrote so that their personal ideals and feelings coloured their whole work and in parts falsified it. Now, if this is so, who wrote real history, history not coloured by points of view and ideals? Clearly no one. ... History, to be, must be seen, and must be seen by somebody, from somebody&#x27;s point of view. ... But this is not an accusation against any particular school of historians; it is a law of our nature.&quot;

In summary, Edward Carr here presents his interesting developments regarding the theories proposed by Benedetto Croce and later taken up by Robin Collingwood. In doing so Carr does not allege mistaken views or fault specific to Mommsen, or to any of the other historians he mentions. Rather any such errors and faults would be general to all history writing. As Collingwood states, &quot;The only safe way of avoiding error is to give up looking for the truth.&quot; Nonetheless, this line of thought, and these examples and illustrations of how Mommsen&#x27;s Germany might color his history of ancient Rome, are illuminating concerning both the process and the result.

===Caesar===

The figure of Julius Caesar (100–44) remains controversial among historians and students of ancient Rome. Mommsen saw in him a leader with a special gift for organizing and transforming the city-state, which had come to rule the Mediterranean world. Caesar was opposed by an oligarchy of aristocratic families, the &quot;optimates&quot;, who dominated the Senate and nearly monopolized state offices, who profited by the city&#x27;s corruption and exploited the foreign conquests. They blocked the change necessitated by the times, stifling or coopting, at times by violence, any who advanced progressive programs. Although the state was dangerously unsteady, and the city often rent by armed mobs, the &quot;optimates&quot; rested on their heritage of the Roman tradition.

Caesar sprang from the heart of this old nobility, yet he was born into a family which had already allied itself with the &quot;populares&quot;, i.e., those who favored constitutional change. Hence Caesar&#x27;s career was associated with the struggle for a new order and, failing opportunity along peaceful avenues, he emerged as a military leader whose triumph at arms worked to advance political change. Yet both parties in this long struggle had checkered histories of violence and corruption. Mommsen, too, recognized and reported &quot;Caesar the rake, Caesar the conspirator, and Caesar the groundbreaker for later centuries of absolutism.&quot;

Some moderns follow the &quot;optimate&quot; view that it was a nefarious role that Caesar played in the fall of the Republic, whose ruling array of institutions had not yet outlived their usefulness. To the contrary, the Republic&#x27;s fall ushered in the oppressive Empire whose &#x27;divine&#x27; rulers held absolute power. Julius Caesar as villain was an opinion shared, of course, by his knife-wielding assassins, most of whom were also nobility. Shared also without shame by that epitome of classical Roman politics and letters, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43). For some observers, following Caesar&#x27;s assassination Cicero saved his rather erratic career in politics by his high-profile stand in favor of the Republic. Also strong among Caesar&#x27;s opponents was Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (95–46), who had long led the &quot;opimates&quot;, supporters of the republican aristocracy, against the &quot;populares&quot; and in particular against Julius Caesar. During the Imperial era the stoic Cato became the symbol of lost republican virtue.

Nonetheless, even deadly foes could see the bright genius of Caesar; indeed, many conspitators were his beneficiaries. &quot;Brutus, Cassius and the others who, like Cicero, attached themselves to the conspiracy acted less out of enmity to Caesar than out of a desire to destroy his &quot;dominatio&quot;.&quot; Too, the conspiracy failed to restore the Republic. An aristocrat&#x27;s &quot;libertas&quot; meant very little to the population: the people, the armies, or even the equestrians; his assassins &quot;failed to grasp the real pulse of the &quot;respublica&quot;.&quot;

Moderns may be able to see both sides of the issue, however, as an historian might. Indeed, there exists a great difference in context between, say, an American, and a German historian of the 1850s, where during 1848 citizens had made a rather spontaneous, incoherent effort to move German politics toward a free and unified country: it was crushed by the nobility.

The philosopher Robin Collingwood (1889–1943) developed a nuanced view of history in which each person explores &quot;the past&quot; in order to create his or her own true understanding of that person&#x27;s unique &quot;cultural inheritance&quot;. Although objectivity remains crucial to the process, each will naturally draw out their own inner truth from the universe of human truth. This fits the stark limitations on each individual&#x27;s ability to know all sides of history. To a mitigated extent these constraints work also on the historian. Collingwood writes:

&quot;This does not reduce history to something arbitrary or capricious. It remains genuine knowledge. How can this be, if my thoughts about Julius Caesar differ from Mommsen&#x27;s? Must not one of us be wrong? No, because the object differs. My historical [object] is about my own past, not about Mommsen&#x27;s past. Mommsen and I share in a great many things, and in many respects we share in a common past; but in so far as we are different people and representatives of different cultures and different generations we have different pasts. ... [O]ur views of Julius Caesar must differ, slightly perhaps, but perceptibly. This difference is not arbitrary, for I can see—or ought to be able to see—that in his place, apart (once more) from all questions of error, I should have come to his conclusions.&quot;

A modern historian of ancient Rome echoes the rough, current consensus of academics about this great and controversial figure, as he concludes his well-regarded biography of Julius Caesar: &quot;When they killed him his assassins did not realise that they had eliminated the best and most far-sighted mind of their class.&quot;

==Commentary II==
===4th volume===

Mommsen mentioned the future publication of a fourth volume on the Roman Empire. Due to the immense popularity of his first three, there remained for decades substantial interest and expectation concerning the appearance of this fourth volume. Yet it did not appear in Mommsen&#x27;s lifetime. Consequently, this missing fourth volume has caused numerous scholars to speculate about the reasons &#x27;why not&#x27;. Concurrently, such musings served to suggest where Theodore Mommsen was to be situated amid the portrait gallery of historians of the 19th century and the modern era.

As to the matter of why &quot;Mommsen failed to continue his history beyond the fall of the republic&quot;, Carr wrote: &quot;During his active career, the problem of what happened once the strong man had taken over was not yet actual. Nothing inspired Mommsen to project this problem back on to the Roman scene; and the history of the empire remained unwritten.&quot;
===Discernment===

Because of Mommsen&#x27;s expert knowledge across many field of study, he &quot;knows as an eyewitness because... such a perfect comprehension [places him] in the position of a contemporary. [Thus he feels] a certainty he cannot explain, like the judgment of a statesman or a shrewd man of business who forms his opinions by processes he does not attempt to analyse.&quot;

While not following Niebuhr&#x27;s &#x27;divination&#x27;, Mommsen&#x27;s manner goes to question of whether one may use discrete and controlled &#x27;intersticial projection&#x27;, safeguarded by monitoring the results closely &quot;after the fact&quot;. Does its use necessarily sacrifice claims to &#x27;objectivity&#x27;? Termed intuition based on scholarship, practitioners of such techniques are vulnerable to caustic challenges to the integrity of their science. Acknowledgement of such infirmities may also include an assessment of the skill involved and the quality of the result.

===Praise===

Mommsen&#x27;s work continues to attract a refined and popular readership. In their introduction Saunders and Collins express their admiration for Mommsen and his contribution to the study of ancient Roman history:

&quot;Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) was the greatest classical historian of his century or of ours. His only rival in any century was Edward Gibbon, whose monumental History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire complements rather than competes with Mommsen&#x27;s superb description of the Roman republic.&quot;

One encyclopaedic reference summarizes: &quot;Equally great as antiquary, jurist, political and social historian, Mommsen [had] no rivals. He combined the power of minute investigation with a singular faculty for bold generalization... .&quot; About &quot;The History of Rome&quot; the universal historian Arnold J. Toynbee writes, &quot;Mommsen wrote a great book, which certainly will always be reckoned among the masterpieces of Western historical literature.&quot; G. P. Gooch gives us these comments evaluating Mommsen&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;: &quot;Its sureness of touch, its many-sided knowledge, its throbbing vitality and the Venetian colouring of its portraits left an ineffaceable impression on every reader.&quot; &quot;It was a work of genius and passion, the creation of a young man, and is as fresh and vital to-day as when it was written.&quot;

==1902 Nobel Prize==

In 1902 Professor Theodor Mommsen became the second person to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, which had been inaugurated the preceding year. This world recognition was given him with &quot;special reference&quot; to the . The commendation called him &quot;the greatest living master of the art of historical writing.&quot;

The award came nearly fifty years after the first appearance of the work. The award also came during the last year of the author&#x27;s life (1817–1903). It is the only time thus far that the Nobel Prize for Literature has been presented to a historian &quot;per se&quot;. Yet the literary Nobel has since been awarded to a philosopher (1950) with mention of an &quot;intellectual history&quot;, and to a war-time leader (1953) for speeches and writings, including a &quot;current events history&quot;, plus a Nobel Memorial Prize has been awarded for two &quot;economic histories&quot; (1993). Nonetheless Mommsen&#x27;s multi-volume &quot;The History of Rome&quot; remains in a singular Nobel class.

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, a well-regarded reference yet nonetheless &quot;a source unsparingly critical&quot;, summarizes: &quot;Equally great as antiquary, jurist, political and social historian, Mommsen lived to see the time when among students of Roman history he had pupils, followers, critics, but no rivals. He combined the power of minute investigation with a singular faculty for bold generalization and the capacity for tracing out the effects of thought on political and social life.&quot;

The British historian G. P. Gooch, writing in 1913, eleven years after Mommsen&#x27;s Nobel prize, gives us this evaluation of his &quot;Römisches Geschichte&quot;: &quot;Its sureness of touch, its many-sided knowledge, its throbbing vitality and the Venetian colouring of its portraits left an ineffaceable impression on every reader.&quot; &quot;It was a work of genius and passion, the creation of a young man, and is as fresh and vital to-day as when it was written.&quot; About &quot;The History of Rome&quot; another British historian Arnold J. Toynbee in 1934 wrote, at the beginning of his own 12-volume universal history, &quot;Mommsen wrote a great book, [&quot;Römisches Geschichte&quot;], which certainly will always be reckoned among the masterpieces of Western historical literature.&quot;

<text>Yuchi or Euchee is the language of the (Children of the Sun), also known as the Yuchi people, now living in Oklahoma. Historically, they lived in what is now known as the southeastern United States, including eastern Tennessee, western Carolinas, northern Georgia, and Alabama, during the period of early European colonization. Many speakers of the Yuchi language became allied with the Muscogee Creek when they migrated into their territory in Georgia and Alabama. They were forcibly relocated with them to Indian Territory in the early 19th century.

Some audio tapes in the Yuchi language exist in the collections of the Columbus State University Archives in Columbus, Georgia.

==Classification==

Yuchi is classified as a language isolate, because it is not known to be related to any other language. Various linguists have claimed, however, that the language has a distant relationship with the Siouan family: Sapir in 1921 and 1929, Haas in 1951 and 1964, Elmendorf in 1964, Rudus in 1974, and Crawford in 1979.

==Geographic distribution ==
Yuchi is primarily spoken in northeastern Oklahoma, where Yuchi people live in present-day Tulsa, Okmulgee, and Creek counties, within the Muscogee (Creek) Nation&#x27;s tribal jurisdictional area. In 1997, 12 to 19 elders spoke the language out of an estimated Yuchi population of 1,500 speakers. In 2009, only five fluent speakers, whose first language was not English, remained, and in 2011 only one.

==History==
Yuchi people lived in Tennessee at the time of European contact. In the early 18th century, they moved to northwestern Georgia in the southeastern United States, under pressure from the powerful Cherokee in Tennessee. There they settled near the Muscogee Creek and were allied with them. In the 1830s, speakers of the Yuchi language were forcibly relocated with the Muscogee people to Indian Territory.

===Contradictions in linguistic study and linguistic history===
The spoken Yuchi language has changed over time, in part due to relocation. In 1885 in an article in &quot;Science&quot;, Swiss linguist Albert S. Gatschet wrote about various linguistic idiosyncrasies in Yuchi. He said that adjectives are not expressed with number, but nouns are, by the addition of the particle (coming from the original term ), which made the word essentially plural. He also said that the language was no longer in an archaic state due to the lack of a &quot;dual,&quot; and that the language had temporal and personal inflection. Gatschet did much field study and documentation regarding the language. Many of his original vocabulary lists can be found at the National Anthropological Archives or on their website.

In 1907, American Frank G. Speck published &quot;Ethnology of Yuchi Indians&quot;. He said that Yuchi had only one dialect, that inflection was not a characteristic, and that there were no true plurals. These conclusions contradict Gatschet&#x27;s published 1885 study. The two authors did agree on linguistic idiosyncrasy, and the case of the third person.

In 1997, the Euchee United Cultural Historical Educational Efforts (E.U.C.H.E.E.) published a work entitled &quot;Euchees: Past and Present&quot;, providing more current information regarding the language. The organization claimed that there were two currently spoken dialects: the Duck Creek/Polecat and the Bigpond variations, which were spoken by Yuchi people of those communities in Oklahoma. This contradicts Speck&#x27;s 1907 claim of one dialect.

==Current status==

Due to assimilation into Muscogee and English-speaking culture, only a few elderly speakers of the Yuchi language were left by the 21st century.

In 2000 the estimated number of fluent Yuchi speakers was 15, but this number dwindled to 7 by 2006, 5 by 2010, and 4 by 2013. In 2016, Yuchi elder Josephine Wildcat Bigler died. Speaking Yuchi as her first language, she had been active in recording and preserving the language for future generations. Her sister, Maxine Wildcat Barnett, was the last tribal elder to speak fluent Yuchi, passing away August 27, 2021.

The Yuchi Language Project (YLP) taught Yuchi classes in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, free of charge. The YLP opened the Yuchi Immersion School in 2018 where English is not spoken, despite an Oklahoma state law passed in 2010 declaring English the state&#x27;s official language. 

The Yuchi people and language are the subject of a chapter in &quot;Spoken Here: Travels Among Threatened Languages&quot; (2003), a book on endangered languages by Canadian writer Mark Abley.

==Phonology==

The language has 49 sounds, 38 of which are consonants, and the remaining 11 are vowels. This number is more than twice that of most Southeastern Native American languages.

===Vowels===

Yuchi has oral and nasal vowels. Oral vowels are defined as being created by the raising of the soft palate to the nasopharyngeal wall, creating a velopharyngeal space within the oral cavity; nasal vowels, on the other hand, are typically defined as being created by the lowering of the soft palate, allowing air to escape through the nasal cavity.

Two vowel charts appears below. The vowels below represent the &quot;phonetic&quot; inventory, meaning the set of all (or most) sounds in the language. The &quot;phonemic&quot; inventory, those sounds which contrastively mark differences in meaning, are highlighted in the list below the vowel charts.

The phonemic vowels of Yuchi are ; some levels of phonological or morphological variation must therefore be occurring in order for all of the sounds above to be possible.

====Phonological variation====

Phonological variation often occurs in different kinds of morphological environments. For example, the phoneme is often pronounced as in 1st-person singular and impersonal 3rd-person pronouns by Big Pond speakers. Also, the phonemes and can become in unstressed environments.

====Length====

Vowel length indicates grammatical function, such as superlative or comparative adjective forms or emphasis. It may also indicate contracted morphemes, and thus is not a phonological process but rather a morphological one.

===Consonants===
Yuchi has been analyzed as having from 19 to 40 consonants, chiefly depending on whether the glottalized and labialized consonants are counted, or considered to be sequences with and , respectively. Some of the latter are included in the table in parentheses:

===Stress and intonation===

====Stress====
Stress in Yuchi is fairly regular. All major parts of speech have syllable-final stress, and syllable-initial secondary stress; also, particles (one-syllable words) are stressed. There are some minimal pairs to be found due to stress; some representative samples include:

: – &quot;Creek person, tribe&quot;
: – &quot;go see someone&quot;
: – he sees
: – she sees
: – &quot;weeds&quot;
: – &quot;squirrel&quot;

As mentioned above, most nouns have syllable-final primary stress; there are, however, some regularized exceptions to this rule, the most common of which are nouns with lexicalized suffixes in the stem, which have stress on the penultimate syllable. Also, contractions within compounded nouns have primary stress on the contraction. There are various other exceptions, but the two mentioned above are the most frequent and the most important in helping us to understand why Yuchi nouns often appear to have irregular stress patterns.

Both regular and non-regular stress patterns are exemplified below, all glossed. All data come from Wagner, 1974, unless otherwise noted.

: – young man
: – sparks of fire
: – water
: – earth
: – the sun
: ~ – today, morning
: – misty rain
: – meat

Verb stems typically have primary stress on the ultimate syllable, as well. The two major exceptions are reduplicated verbs, which have equal stress on both the last and reduplicated syllables of the stem, and verb compounds with the head root , in which primary stress is syllable-initial. Some examples include:

: – to hold it up
: – light

====Intonation====

Intonation varies depending upon the kinds of sentences being uttered. Declarative, negative, and command speech acts have falling intonation, while information questions and yes/no questions have rising pitch. Morphologically, intonation can also change the reception of a word and its intended meaning, as we see in the following example of three different intonation patterns for the word &quot;What&quot;:

: – &quot;What?&quot; (requesting information)
: – &quot;What?&quot; (didn&#x27;t hear)
: – &quot;What?&quot; (frightened/surprised)

====Contractions====

One of the most significant aspects of Yuchi morphophonology is the prevalence of contractions. Contraction should not here be taken to mean only a shortening of words; rather, it is more useful to think of contraction as a deletion of sounds that in turn affects surrounding vowels.

What can be contracted is dependent upon two major factors, the sound which begins the contracted syllable, and the stress of the syllable. In order for a syllable to be contracted, it must begin with a [+sonorant] consonant, that is, a voiced sound with a relatively free passage of air. In Yuchi, this includes sounds such as (where indicates a glottalized sound), the fricative , and . A syllable must also be unstressed in order to contract.

Contraction causes phonetic changes in the vowels directly preceding the deleted syllable. In order for Yuchi speakers to understand the grammatical features of the words being used in contracted forms, vowel features alternate to match the deleted sounds. So, for example, if the morpheme was contracted, the vowel preceding it would become nasalized to indicate that a nasal sound has been lost.

Contraction must necessarily come before the phonetic change in vowels. For example, consider the following word:

: – &#x27;Did you look in the box?&#x27;

 can contract here because it is an unstressed syllable beginning with a sonorant: . CCC clusters are relatively rare, occurring in only six variations as noted by Wolff, four of them beginning with fricatives; such a construction as above would therefore likely be odd to speakers of Yuchi.

Contractions take on several forms and occur in many other environments. Those seeking additional information about the many kinds of contraction in Yuchi are advised to seek out Dr. Mary Linn&#x27;s &quot;A Grammar of Euchee.&quot;

A list of the most commonly contracted morphemes is below, along with their grammatical function.

* ne- : 2nd-person singular actor
* we-: 3rd-person non-Yuchi actor or patient, singular or plural
* &#x27;o-: 3rd-person plural Yuchi actor or patient (women&#x27;s speech)
* hi-: 3rd-person inanimate patient, singular or plural
* ho-: 3rd-person inanimate patient and participant, singular or plural
* &#x27;yu-: verb root
* -ne-: habitual aspect
* -e: active verbalizer

== Orthography ==
The language had no standard orthography until the 1970s, when linguists James Crawford and Addie George (Yuchi) created a phonetic transliteration. Yuchi people have adopted this to write the language.

== Grammar ==
Like many Indigenous languages of the Americas, Yuchi grammar is agglutinative. Words are formed by the addition of various prefixes and suffixes to a stem. Yuchi features separate male and female registers and an idiosyncratic noun classification system wherein nominal distinction is made regarding animacy, Yuchi ethnicity, kinship and, for inanimate nouns, shape or spatial position.

Much of the information in this section is drawn from Wagner (1938); some of Wagner&#x27;s conclusions, particularly regarding his interpretation of Yuchi kinship terminology and certain aspects of his description of Yuchi pronouns, have been disputed.

===Morphosyntax===
Yuchi is an agglutinative language, in which words are pieced together from pre-existing morphemes to make entirely new words. The word order of the language is subject–object–verb.

The language uses clitics and particles to express a variety of things, including possessives, cases, affixes, ideas, locatives, instrumentals, simulatives, ablatives, and demonstratives.

===Verbs===
The Yuchi verb consists of a mono- or polysyllabic stem modified almost exclusively by suffixing. Yuchi features attributive verbs, which is to say that the language makes very little distinction between verbs and adjectives as parts of speech. For this reason, Yuchi verbs and adjectives are virtually identical.

====Tense====
The concept of temporal verb inflection is only weakly realized in Yuchi and corresponds more closely in some cases to aspect rather than tense. The past tense is generally expressed via suffixing of the verb stem.
*-djinincomplete past (&quot;ate&quot;)
*-dji&#x27;nfwacomplete past (&quot;had eaten&quot;)
*-djinfa&#x27;habitual past (&quot;used to eat&quot;)
*-djinfwadji&#x27;nemphatic past (&quot;happened to eat&quot;)
*-djigo&#x27;uncertain past (&quot;perhaps ate&quot;)

There are also two ways of expressing future tense. The first, which usually denotes intentions or events of the immediate future, is expressed by lengthening, stressing and nasalizing the final syllable of the verb stem. The second, pertaining to the distant future, is expressed by the suffix -&quot;e&#x27;le&quot;.

====Modality====
Modality of the verb is also expressed through suffixing.
*-no     imperative (&quot;go!&quot;)
*-wo     exhortative (&quot;should go&quot;)
*-go     potential (&quot;might go&quot;)
*-ho     emphatic (&quot;did go&quot;)
*-te     ability (&quot;can go&quot;)

===Nouns===
Nouns are classified according to a broad animate versus inanimate paradigm which is expressed using a variety of article suffixes. Within the animate class, nouns are further subdivided into two sub-classes. The first of these includes all humans belonging to the Yuchi tribe, and is itself further divided according to a very complex system of kinship relations and gendered speech registers. The second sub-class of animate nouns encompasses all human beings outside of the Yuchi tribe, as well as animals, and the sun and moon. The animate (Yuchi) suffixes express a very complex system of kinship and gendered speech, in much the same way as do third person pronouns.
*-noany male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*-sen&#x27;oany younger (for men, related) female (used by men and women)
*-s&#x27;en&#x27;oyounger male relative (used by women only)
*-enoolder female relative (used by men and women)
*-onoyounger unrelated male or any other unrelated person (used by women only)
*-inoolder male relative (used by women only)
*-weno&#x27;all other animate beings

Inanimate nouns are divided into three groups: vertical, horizontal, and round objects or those otherwise do not conform to either of the other two groups. Each of these groups is represented by a suffix.
*-fa     vertical
*-&#x27;e     horizontal
*-dji     round

====Number====
The concept of plurality in Yuchi is not as strongly developed as in English, leading one early descriptivist to claim that Yuchi has &quot;no true plural.&quot; Animate nouns can, however, be pluralized by the addition of suffixes that correspond closely to their singular counterparts. Although tribal affiliation and gender distinctions carry over into the plural, kinship does not.
*-he&#x27;noYuchi tribe members (male speech)
*-o&#x27;noYuchi tribe members (female speech)
*-we&#x27;noall other animate beings

Inanimate nouns can be made plural by the suffix &quot;-ha&quot;, which replaces the singular inanimate suffixes listed above.

In addition to suffixing, several words related to kinship are pluralized via reduplication of the stem.

===Pronouns===
The Yuchi pronoun is extremely complex. Except in a few emphatic forms, the pronoun is always suffixed to a verb or noun stem, and appears in eight distinct sets.

The first pronoun set, termed the &quot;Subjective Series&quot;, denotes the subject relationship of the pronoun to the verb. Series 1 and 2 are close variations that respectively represent a general and specific object, whereas the &quot;independent series&quot; represents freestanding pronouns.

Third person pronouns follow a complex pattern of kinship and gendered speech that corresponds very closely to the animate noun suffixes.
*ho- / ho- / hodiany male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*se- / sio- / sediany younger (for men, related) female (used by men and women)
*s&#x27;e- / s&#x27;io- / s&#x27;ediyounger male relative (used by women only)
*e- / eyo- / ediolder female relative (used by men and women)
*o- / o- / odiyounger unrelated male or any other unrelated person (used by women only)
*i-any older male relative (used by women only)
*we- / yo- / wedi&#x27;all animate, non-Yuchi beings

First person pronouns in the plural are inclusive and exclusive, and there are several kinship-specific third person forms.

A few of the third person singular pronouns double as plural pronouns as well.
*ho- / ho- / hodiany male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*o- / o- / odiin the plural, refers to any younger Yuchi regardless of kinship or gender (used by women only) 
*i-in the plural, refers to any older Yuchi regardless of kinship or gender (used by women only)
*we- / yo- / wedi&#x27;all animate, non-Yuchi beings

The next set, termed the &quot;Objective Series&quot;, denotes the direct or indirect object relationship of the pronoun to the verb. It otherwise functions identically to the Subjective Series; the two pronoun sets are distinguished by their relative positions within the verb complex.

The third person singular pronouns are identical to those of the Subjective Series.
*ho- / ho- / hodiany male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*se- / sio- / sediany younger (for men, related) female (used by men and women)
*s&#x27;e- / s&#x27;io- / s&#x27;ediyounger male relative (used by women only)
*e- / eyo- / ediolder female relative (used by men and women)
*o- / o- / odiyounger unrelated male or any other unrelated person (used by women only) 
*i-any older male relative (used by women only)
*we- / yo- / wedi&#x27;all animate, non-Yuchi beings

As above, the third person plural pronouns are identical to those of the Subjective Series.
*ho- / ho- / hodiany male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*o- / o- / odiin the plural, refers to any younger Yuchi regardless of kinship or gender (used by women only) 
*i-in the plural, refers to any older Yuchi regardless of kinship or gender (used by women only)
*we- / yo- / wedi&#x27;all animate, non-Yuchi beings

====Reflexive pronouns====
Reflexive pronouns are amalgamations of the Objective Series 1 and Subjective Series 1 (&quot;Reflexive Series 1&quot;) or Subjective Series 2 (&quot;Reflexive Series 2&quot;) pronouns.

Reflexive third person pronouns function the same, in terms of kinship and gendered speech, as their non-reflexive counterparts.
*hode&#x27;- / hondio&#x27;-any male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*siode&#x27;- / siodio&#x27;-any younger (for men, related) female (used by men and women)
*s&#x27;iode&#x27;- / s&#x27;iodio&#x27;-younger male relative (used by women only)
*e&#x27;yode- / eyondio&#x27;-older female relative (used by men and women)
*ode&#x27;- / odio&#x27;-younger unrelated male or any other unrelated person (used by women only) 
*yode&#x27;- / yondio&#x27;-any older male relative (used by women only)

Plural reflexive pronouns demonstrate clusivity in the first person, and are identical to non-reflexives in terms of kinship and gendered speech.

Plural reflexive pronouns function identically to their non-reflexive counterparts in the third person.
*hode&#x27;- / hondio&#x27;-any male or female Yuchi (used by men and women)
*ode&#x27;- / odio&#x27;-in the plural, refers to any younger Yuchi regardless of kinship or gender (used by women only) 
*yode&#x27;- / yondio&#x27;-in the plural, refers to any older Yuchi regardless of kinship or gender (used by women only)

===Other affixes===

====Instrumental prefixes====
The relationship between an action and the instrument by which it is carried out is expressed via the prefix . This prefix has become fused in some cases with certain verb stems, forming a sort of instrumental verbal compound of idiomatic meaning.

====Locative affixes====
The concept of location is important to the Yuchi verb complex. Similar in some ways to the English preposition, these prefixes denote the location or direction of the verb&#x27;s action.

Additionally, there are four very general locative suffixes that can be used in place of the prefixes listed above.
===Negation===
An entire verbal complex can be negated using one of two prefixes, or , both of which are identical in meaning.

===Interrogatives===
In direct speech wherein the sentence does not begin with an interrogative pronoun, interrogatives are formed with the suffix . If the question implies some action in the future, the suffix is used instead.

<text>Alan Jay Heeger (born January 22, 1936) is an American physicist, academic and Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry.

Heegar was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering in 2002 for co-founding the field of conducting polymers and for pioneering work in making these novel materials available for technological applications.

==Life and career==
Heeger was born in Sioux City, Iowa, into a Jewish family. He grew up in Akron, Iowa, where his father owned a general store. At age nine, following his father&#x27;s death, the family moved to Sioux City.

Heeger earned a B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1957, and a Ph.D in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1961. From 1962 to 1982 he was on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1982 he commenced his present appointment as a professor in the Physics Department and the Materials Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His research has led to the formation of numerous start-up companies including Uniax, Konarka, and Sirigen, founded in 2003 by Guillermo C. Bazan, Patrick J. Dietzen, Brent S. Gaylord. Alan Heeger was a founder of Uniax, which was acquired by DuPont.

He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2000 along with Alan G. MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa &quot;for their discovery and development of conductive polymers&quot;; They published their results on polyacetylene a conductive polymer in 1977. This led to the construction of the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model, a simple model for topological insulators.

He had won the Oliver E. Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society in 1983 and, in 1995, the Balzan Prize for Science of Non-Biological Materials.

His sons are the neuroscientist David Heeger and the immunologist Peter Heeger.

In October 2010, Heeger participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Heeger is also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Advisory Board. Heeger has been a judge of the &quot;STAGE&quot; International Script Competition three times (2006, 2007, 2010).

&quot;Perhaps the greatest pleasure of being a scientist is to have an abstract idea, then to do an experiment (more often a series of experiments is required) that demonstrates the idea was correct; that is, Nature actually behaves as conceived in the mind of the scientist. This process is the essence of creativity in science. I have been fortunate to have experienced this intense pleasure many times in my life.&quot;

<text>The British Rail BEMU was an experimental two-car battery electric multiple unit (BEMU), converted from the prototype Derby Lightweight Diesel multiple units. The train was powered by many lead-acid batteries, and was used on the Deeside Railway from Aberdeen to Ballater in Scotland from April 1958 until it was finally withdrawn in December 1966. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board initiated the design and was a joint sponsor. The board promised to supply power at three farthings per unit for a fixed two-year period. It provided an 11kV supply to a charger at Aberdeen&#x27;s platform 1 and a 6.6kV supply to a charger at Ballater.

==Career==
The estimated cost of the fit-out was £50,000, with the two coaches accounting for almost half of that. Because each set of batteries weighed about eight tons, the underframe of the carriages needed strengthening, at a budgeted cost of £2,000. Motors, conduits and cabling were costed at £5,000.

The unit was equipped with a new type of battery in the early 1960s, but subsequently suffered a series of small fires in the battery areas and was withdrawn from service. It returned to use for a period before closure of the line in 1966.

==Departmental use and preservation==
The train then spent a short time in storage at Inverurie Works, and at Hyndland Shed in Glasgow, before being transferred to departmental use as test train &quot;Gemini&quot; (or &quot;Laboratory 16&quot;) for use at the Railway Technical Centre, at Derby. It lasted in this role until it was withdrawn in 1984, and was eventually bought for preservation at the proposed West Yorkshire Transport Museum, where it was returned to working order. The museum placed it on loan to the East Lancashire Railway in 1994 where, after asbestos was removed and the batteries refurbished, it was used on some services until 2000. After the museum went into liquidation, the unit was purchased by the Royal Deeside Railway near Crathes, in 2001. It is now back in Scotland, where it is undergoing refurbishment.

Details are as follows:

<doc id="1183278" wikidata="Q6562922" url="?curid=1183278" title="List of prisons in Australia">
<text>This is a list of operational and former [[Australian prisons]] for adult males and females and youth detention centres for juveniles. Prisons listed as &quot;museum&quot; are former prisons that are now open for public inspection and tours.

Throughout the European history of Australia, particularly since its formation as a penal colony, Australia has had many establishments for rehabilitation and incarceration. Altogether, there have been more than 180+ rehabilitation centres, youth correctional centres and prisons in Australia.

== Australian Capital Territory ==

A new prison was opened on 11 September 2008 at Hume, called the Alexander Maconochie Centre, named after Alexander Maconochie. The centre is designed as a multi role facility to replace the Belconnen Remand Centre and provide detention facilities so that prisoners who are currently held in New South Wales facilities may be held locally.

== New South Wales ==

The following list of operational and closed correctional facilities has been sourced from the Corrective Services NSW and from the State Records archives.
:

== Northern Territory ==
== Queensland ==


== South Australia ==

Prisons in South Australia are managed by the South Australian, Department for Correctional Services apart from the Mount Gambier Prison and Adelaide Remand Centre which are managed by GSL Group.
== Tasmania ==

== Victoria ==


Adult Prisons and correctional facilities in Victoria are managed by Corrections Victoria. Two prisons are privatised and managed by G4S Australia Pty. Limited and GEO Group Australia Pty. Limited. Youth Justice custodial centres are managed by the Department of Justice and Community Safety.

Victorian Prisons are mostly located in regional Victoria. The prison system is relatively modern with the closure of the last of the &quot;old&quot; gaols in 2005. Bendigo and Won Wron were the last to be closed. Beechworth Prison was closed in 2004 and replaced with the Beechworth Correctional Centre the following year. New prisons are being built or planned at Ararat and Ravenhall. Many prisons have had recent expansions in terms of bed numbers.

At 30 June 2015 there were 4,769 sentenced prisoners and 1,413 unsentenced prisoners in Victoria, thus making a total of 6,182 prisoners. From those 6,182 prisoners, 5,762 were males (93%) and 420 were females (7%). Those numbers also include 480 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners, making them 8% of the total number of prisoners in Victoria.

In 2015, the average male prisoner in Victoria was:
* 35.5 years old
* born in Australia
* did not complete high school
* a history of alcohol and drug abuse
* single and unemployed at the time he entered the prison system
* sentence of three years in a medium security prison
* more likely than not to have been imprisoned previously
In 2015, the average female prisoner in Victoria was:
* 36 years old
* born in Australia
* single or in a de facto relationship
* likely to be a mother/primary care giver
* unemployed, home duties or on a pension before prison
* has a higher level of education than her male counterpart but still failed to complete high school
