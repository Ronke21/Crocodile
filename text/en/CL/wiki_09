<text>The Greater Richmond Region, also known as the Richmond metropolitan area or Central Virginia, is a region and metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Virginia, centered on Richmond. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines the area as the Richmond, VA Metropolitan Statistical Area, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other entities. The OMB defines the area as comprising 17 county-level jurisdictions, including the independent cities of Richmond, Petersburg, Hopewell, and Colonial Heights. As of 2020, it had a population of 1,314,434, making it the 44th largest MSA in the country.

The Greater Richmond Region is located in the central part of Virginia. It straddles the Fall Line, where the coastal plain and the Piedmont come together on the James River at Richmond and the Appomattox River at Petersburg. The English established each as a colonial port in the 17th century. The Greater Richmond Metro region is considered to be the southern extension of the Northeast megalopolis.

==Political subdivisions and communities==

===Independent cities===
Since a state constitutional change in 1871, all incorporated cities in Virginia have been independent cities and are not legally located in any county. The OMB considers these independent cities to be county-equivalents to define MSAs in Virginia. Each MSA is listed by its counties, then cities, each in alphabetical order and not by size.

The area includes four independent cities (listed in order of population):
*Richmond
*Petersburg
*Hopewell
*Colonial Heights

The three smaller cities (Petersburg, Hopewell, and Colonial Heights) are located near each other in an area south of Richmond and are known collectively as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot;.

The following counties are included in the Richmond MSA:

* Amelia County

==Population==
The Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes three other cities (Petersburg, Hopewell, and Colonial Heights) and adjacent counties, is home to approximately 1.3 million Virginians or 15.1% of Virginia&#x27;s population. The Richmond region is growing steadily, adding nearly 400,000 residents in the past two decades. This has resulted in major suburban sprawl, particularly in Henrico and Chesterfield Counties, which have populations over 300,000. This also resulted in boosts in its economy, the building of malls, more national attention, and major sporting events and concerts coming to Richmond. Its arts and culture scene has also seen a major gain, with the building or renovations of many new arenas, including the Landmark Theater, Carpenter Center, CenterStage, and the creation of an art walk, the First Fridays Art Walk, occurring on the first Friday of every month on Broad Street in Downtown Richmond, drawing crowds of over 20,000 people. The population has seen its ups and downs, with the city of Richmond itself dropping a bit below 200,000 but coming back in 2008 to 204,000 people again.

The region is located approximately equidistant from Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Lynchburg. The area is home to the state&#x27;s center of gravity of population—which, in 1980, was located thirty miles west of Richmond near the Powhatan-Goochland County border.

The median age for the MSA was 36.7 years. For people reporting one race alone, 66 percent were White; 30 percent were Black or African American; less than 0.5 percent were American Indian and Alaskan Native; 2.75 percent were Asian; less than 0.5 percent were Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 1 percent were some other race. One percent reported two or more races. Three percent of the people in the Richmond/Petersburg MSA were Hispanic. Sixty-three percent of the people in the Richmond/Petersburg MSA were White non-Hispanic. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. The median house income for the MSA was $59,468. The median family income was $65,289. The Per Capita income was $27,887. In 2004, seven percent of people were in poverty. Poverty status is determined by the U.S. Census Bureau and is based on family composition, size, and income level. In the Richmond/Petersburg MSA, nine percent of children under age 18 were below the poverty line, and eight
percent of people 65 years old and over were below the poverty line. Five percent of all
families, and 15 percent of families with a female householder and no husband present had incomes below the poverty level. The unemployment rate was 4.6%.

In 2004, there were 397,000 households in the Richmond/Petersburg MSA. The average household size was 2.6 people. 
In 2004, 85 percent of people 25 years and over had at least graduated from high school, and 33 percent had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. Among people 16 to 19 years old, nine percent were not in school; they were not enrolled and had not graduated from high school.

==Transportation==
==Travel and tourism==

===Expressways and Interstate highways===
Several of the most heavily traveled highways in the state transverse the area, which includes the junctions of Interstate 64 (which runs east-west), and Interstate Highways 85 and 95 (which run north-south). A comprehensive network of Interstate bypasses and spurs and several non-interstate expressways also serve the area. Tolls fund several of these local roads, although tolls have long been removed from the area&#x27;s first limited access highway, the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike, which opened in 1958 and now forms a portion of I-95 and I-85. I-295 opened in 1992. It was the last segment of Virginia&#x27;s interstate system, forming an eastern bypass of Richmond and Petersburg.

===Railway network===

The Richmond-Petersburg region is also located along several major rail lines operated by CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and the Buckingham Branch Railroad.

The area has four passenger stations served by Amtrak:
* Main Street Station (station code RVM), located in downtown Richmond
* Staples Mill Road Station (station code RVR), located in Henrico County
* Petersburg Station (station code PTB), located in Ettrick
* Ashland Station (station code ASD), located in downtown Ashland, VA
The Department of Rail and Public Transportation of the State of Virginia has studies underway for extending high-speed passenger rail service to the Virginia Peninsula and South Hampton Roads areas with a rail connection at Richmond to service along both the Northeast Corridor and the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor.

Another project, known as Transdominion Express, would extend from Richmond west to Lynchburg and from Washington, DC (Alexandria) south via an existing Virginia Railway Express route to Manassas, extending on south to Charlottesville, Lynchburg, Roanoke and Bristol on the Tennessee border.

===Sea and airport facilities===
An international deepwater terminal is located at the Port of Richmond on the James River which is navigable for shipping to Hampton Roads, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean.

Richmond International Airport is located in Henrico County, five miles east of the city center. The airport serves domestic destinations, primarily in the Midwest, South, and Northeast, and as recently as the 2010s, it served international destinations, including Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas.

In recent years, it has seen remarkable growth in demand, adding non-stop routes such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and Phoenix–Sky Harbor, with seasonal routes to Providence and Minneapolis/St. Paul, among other destinations.

== Politics ==
The Virginia State Capitol is in the historic Capitol Square. Also, the new U.S. Courthouse was opened in 2010, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is located in Richmond, as well, along with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Richmond itself and Petersburg are strongly Democratic. The suburbs began trending Republican nationally as early as the 1950s; Henrico County, for instance, went Republican in every election from 1952 to 2004. However, conservative Byrd Democrats continued to hold most suburban local offices and state legislative seats well into the 1980s. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat to carry the metropolitan area in decades. Since then, it has remained Democratic at the presidential level and, along with northern Virginia, has kept the state of Virginia in the Democratic column.

==Economy==

The applicable Metropolitan Statistical Area for the Richmond-Petersburg region is the Richmond, VA MSA. The Richmond MSA employs a total of approximately 677,000 workers. In order of the number of workers, the major employment categories of the region are services; retail trade; manufacturing; state government; finance, insurance and real estate; local government; construction; wholesale trade; transportation and public utilities and federal government. Important manufacturing categories include tobacco, chemicals, printing and publishing, paper, and wood products.

This economic diversity, typical of the entire Richmond-Petersburg region, helps insulate it from hardship due to economic fluctuation in particular sectors of the economy. The region&#x27;s central location also allows it to benefit from growth in other regions of Virginia and the state as a whole.

=== Economic and community development ===
Several economic and community development entities, both public and private, serve the Greater Richmond area. Government-linked entities such as the Greater Richmond Partnership bring together elected leadership of local government with leaders from business and industry to coordinate initiatives to foster economic prosperity. In the non-profit sector, The Community Foundation for a greater Richmond, one of the largest Community Foundations in the country, supports a wide range of projects with both competitive results-based grants and donor-directed philanthropy as well as more than 60 academic scholarship programs.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems has announced plans to build the world&#x27;s first grid-scale commercial nuclear fusion power plant at the James River Industrial Center in Chesterfield County; the plant is intended to produce about 400 MW of power.

== Culture ==

=== Arts ===
A community-based organization, James River Writers, serves the Greater Richmond Region. It sponsors many writer programs for all career stages, and an annual writers&#x27; conference that draws attendees from near and far.

The region is famous for its Christmastime &quot;tacky lights.&quot; Former Richmond mayor Dwight C. Jones called the city the tacky light capital of the world. Bus &quot;tacky light tours&quot; are offered.

=== Media ===
The Richmond metro area is served by many local television and radio stations. , the Richmond-Petersburg designated market area (DMA) is the 58th largest in the U.S. with 553,950 homes according to Nielsen Market Research. The major network television affiliates are WTVR-TV 6 (CBS), WRIC-TV 8 (ABC), WWBT 12 (NBC), WRLH-TV 35 (Fox), and WUPV 65 (CW). PBS stations include WCVE-TV 23 and WCVW 57. Richmond enjoys a low power FM Station, WRIR, which features all-volunteer community supported radio at all hours.

=== Religion ===
Some 6,000 Indian families resided in the Richmond region as of 2011. Hinduism is actively practiced at several temples and cultural centers. The two best known are the Cultural Center of India (CCI), off Iron Bridge Road in Chesterfield County, and the Hindu Center of Virginia, in Henrico County, which won national acclaim as Virginia&#x27;s first LEED certified religious facility.

=== Sports ===
Auto racing is also popular in the area. The Richmond Raceway (RR) has hosted NASCAR Cup Series races since 1953, and the Capital City 400 from 1962 to 1980. RR also hosted IndyCar&#x27;s SunTrust Indy Challenge from 2001 to 2009. Another track, Southside Speedway, has operated from 1959 until 2020 and sat just southwest of Richmond in Chesterfield County. This oval short-track was known as the &quot;Toughest Track in the South&quot; and &quot;The Action Track&quot;, featuring weekly stock car racing Friday nights. Southside Speedway saw many NASCAR champions, including Richard Petty, Bobby Allison, and Darrell Waltrip. It was the home track of NASCAR superstar Denny Hamlin.

<text>SlashNET is a medium-sized, independently operated Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network. Originally sponsored by Slashdot and founded in 1998, in 1999 SlashNET split off to become its own entity. A few well-known communities and projects maintain an IRC presence at SlashNET, including #g7 (the IRC idle RPG), #totse (Totse), #idiots-club (ZZT Community), #mefi (a Metafilter-related community), various Penny Arcade-related communities, #Twitterponies (a Twitter roleplaying group), and #rags (an old-style rag calligraphy community). As of 2012 it is ranked in the top 40 networks by IRC.Netsplit.de, with an estimated relatively constant 1700 users, and #25/737 by SearchIRC.com.

==Administration==
According to SlashNET&#x27;s website, a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to administration is used. More specifically, SlashNET claims that IRC Operators are just regular users with a status flag next to their nicknames. SlashNET&#x27;s administration officially decries the use of mission statements and other business-like &quot;buzzwords&quot; for IRC networks and rejects the notion that these are necessary for the operation of a network. The overall objective of the administration as described by the network&#x27;s website is &quot;keep the servers running.&quot;

SlashNET is run entirely by volunteers from around the globe. SlashNET&#x27;s servers run UnrealIRCd v3.2.5 on FreeBSD and Linux. IRC services and Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor are also utilized to provide a quality IRC experience for users.

==Forums==
SlashNET has been host to numerous IRC forums with famous people in the tech industry, including Ken Coar, Marcel Gagne, Richard Stallman, Jamie Zawinski, Matt Dillon of DragonflyBSD, Rob &#x27;CmdrTaco&#x27; Malda and Jeff &#x27;Hemos&#x27; Bates of Slashdot, Rusty Foster and Dylan &#x27;Inoshiro&#x27; Griffiths of kuro5hin, and the distributed.net crew. Logs of past forums on SlashNET may be found on the network&#x27;s website.

==Events==
SlashNET, as the key communications method for Slashdot staff, was used in selecting and approving stories on the website. On 9/11, Rob Malda, as &quot;Daddy Pants&quot; of the day, with final say on story acceptance, elected to focus Slashdot only on the unfolding news of the attacks. Telephone exchanges and cell networks were overburdened; many reports and eyewitness accounts came in via IRC. Many of these were posted on Slashdot. The site had 3 million page views for the day.

<doc id="1155774" wikidata="Q2259813" url="?curid=1155774" title="Hotel Room">
<text>Hotel Room (sometimes referred to as David Lynch&#x27;s Hotel Room) is an American drama anthology series that aired for three episodes on HBO on January 8, 1993, with a rerun the next night. Created by Monty Montgomery and David Lynch (who directed two episodes, the first and the third-and last), each episode stars a different cast and takes place in room 603 of the New York City–based &quot;Railroad Hotel&quot;, in the years 1969, 1992, and 1936, respectively. The three episodes (respectively 27, 25 and 47-minute long; for a total of 99 minutes) were created to be shown together in the form of a feature-length pilot, with the hope that if they were well received, a series of episodes in the same stand-alone half-hour format would be produced later. Following a lukewarm reception, HBO chose to not produce more episodes.

==Premise==
The series opens with the following narration, written and spoken by co-creator David Lynch: &quot;For a millennium, the space for the hotel room existed, undefined. Mankind captured it, and gave it shape and passed through. And sometimes when passing through, they found themselves brushing up against the secret names of truth.&quot;

Each story stars a new cast, and takes place in a different year, but is confined in the room 603 of the Railroad Hotel in New York City. The same bellboy and maid appear in each story, as if they do not age.

==Cast==

=== Episode 1 ===
* Glenne Headly as Darlene
* Freddie Jones as Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Holchak
* Harry Dean Stanton as Moe Boca

=== Episode 2 ===
* Griffin Dunne as Robert
* Deborah Unger as Sasha
* Mariska Hargitay as Tina
* Chelsea Field as Diane

=== Episode 3 ===
* Crispin Glover as Danny
* Alicia Witt as Diane

=== Recurring ===
* Clark Heathcliff Brolly as Sean the Bellboy
* Camilla Overbye Roos as Maid

==Production==
Barry Gifford wrote and Lynch directed the first and third episodes; Lynch had previously adapted Gifford&#x27;s &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; novel to film. Jay McInerney wrote and James Signorelli directed the second. The series was produced by Deepak Nayar, who worked with Lynch on &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; and &quot;On the Air&quot;, and executive produced by Monty Montgomery and Lynch. This was Peter Deming&#x27;s second collaboration as cinematographer with Lynch after &quot;On the Air&quot;. The music was composed, conducted and orchestrated by Angelo Badalamenti, a frequent collaborator of Lynch, while the latter was responsible for the sound design.

According to Gifford, HBO was trying to emulate the success of the anthology series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, but &quot;wanted sexier or comedic pieces, not serious sex and not satire exactly, but something else.&quot;

Gifford wrote five scripts, of which HBO produced two. He retained the rights to all five, and has turned them into plays that have been performed in several U.S. states. The teleplays for &quot;Tricks&quot; and &quot;Blackout&quot;, along with the unproduced &quot;Mrs. Kashfi&quot;, which HBO deemed too controversial, have been published in a book by the University Press of Mississippi. &quot;Blackout&quot; was written in just two days, to replace a script by David Mamet that Montgomery was dissatisfied with. Gifford&#x27;s script was only 17 pages long, but Lynch&#x27;s cut of it came in at 47 minutes, by far the longest of the three episodes. HBO aired a truncated version of it, but the VHS release contains the longer, and director&#x27;s preferred, version.

==Episodes==
==Release==
===Broadcast===
&quot;Hotel Room&quot; was broadcast on HBO on January 8, 1993, at 11 pm, and again on January 9, at 12 pm. In its first broadcast, it rated first in its time slot on HBO.

===Home media===
The three episodes of the anthology were released on VHS by Worldvision Enterprises. In Japan, a LaserDisc with English audio and burned-in Japanese subtitles was released by Pony Canyon. Bootleg DVDs captured from these sources also exist.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;David Lynch has long raised suspicions that his work would be most at home on late-night television, but &quot;Hotel Room&quot; indicates otherwise. This setbound omnibus drama, produced by Mr. Lynch and featuring three weak episodes set in the New York City hotel room of the title, plays like a listless visit to a Lynch-style &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; where stories go nowhere, anecdotes are pointlessly bizarre and lame quips are echoed emptily, as if banality were a form of wit.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; had a similar opinion: &quot;Even if you&#x27;re a diehard &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; freak who&#x27;s incorrigibly wild at heart, you&#x27;ll be itching to check out of this 90-minute trilogy (premiering tonight at 11) long before the door finally closes on the tedious doings in Room 603 of the Railroad Hotel in New York City.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; was a little more positive about the third episode: &quot;With the exception of a fine performance by Alicia Witt and a few intriguing moments, the episodes are flat and wooden, lacking the fascinating darkness of Lynch&#x27;s other work.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that although it wouldn&#x27;t become a hit, Lynch fans would enjoy it: &quot;As you might expect with the talent involved, this is the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; not quite so much of the twilight zone as of hell itself, definitely not for the tastes of typical travelers but a marvelously absorbing stay for the Lynch true-faithful, at least.&quot;

<doc id="1155791" wikidata="Q957331" url="?curid=1155791" title="V (Live album)">
<text>V is the sixth studio album by the band Live, released in 2001. It featured the singles &quot;Simple Creed&quot; and &quot;Overcome&quot;, the latter of which received significant exposure following the September 11 attacks.

==History==
The collection of songs that became &quot;V&quot; was never intended to be released as an album. Guitarist Chad Taylor said, &quot;The goal was to prepare songs for the next studio session. MCA got a hold of the material and pushed us to call it an album.&quot; The songs were originally going to be released free to fans as a collection called &quot;Ecstatic Fanatic&quot;. The tracks included two songs featured in films released prior to the release of &quot;V&quot;, &quot;Forever May Not Be Long Enough&quot;, written for the closing credits of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, and &quot;Deep Enough&quot;, which appears in the opening of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; because director Rob Cohen was a fan of Live. Taylor would later express dismay at the label&#x27;s disinterest in promoting those two songs, particularly in light of the box office success of both films. &quot;V&quot; only reached number 22 on the album chart in the US and failed to attain gold status, despite reasonably positive reviews.

<text>Christine Nöstlinger (13 October 1936 – 28 June 2018) was an Austrian writer best known for children&#x27;s books. She received one of two inaugural Astrid Lindgren Memorial Awards from the Swedish Arts Council in 2003, the biggest prize in children&#x27;s literature, for her career contribution to &quot;children&#x27;s and young adult literature in the broadest sense.&quot; She received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for &quot;lasting contribution to children&#x27;s literature&quot; in 1984 and was one of three people through 2012 to win both of these major international awards.

==Life and career==

Nöstlinger was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1936.
By her own admission, she was a wild and angry child. After finishing high school, she wanted to become an artist, and studied graphic arts at the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna. She worked as a graphic artist for a few years, before marrying a journalist, Ernst Nöstlinger, with whom she had two daughters.

The majority of Nöstlinger&#x27;s production is literature for children, and she also wrote for television, radio and newspapers. She centered on the needs of children in her work, with an anti-authoritarian bent. She is known for controversial topics discussing race, gender, sexuality and nationality

Her first book was &quot;Die feuerrote Friederike&quot;, published in 1970, which she illustrated herself. The book was published in English in 1975.

WorldCat reports that her work most widely held in participating libraries is &quot;Fly away home&quot; (&quot;Maikäfer flieg&quot;, 1973).

In 2021, an award in her name, Christine-Nöstlinger-Preis, was jointly established by the city of Vienna and the Union of Austrian book publishers.

==Awards and recognition==
The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Nöstlinger received the writing award in 1984.

<text>Gesta Romanorum (; &quot;Deeds of the Romans&quot;) is a Latin collection of anecdotes and tales that was probably compiled about the end of the 13th century or the beginning of the 14th. It still possesses a two-fold literary interest, first as one of the most popular books of the time, and secondly as the source, directly or indirectly, of later literature, in Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, Giovanni Boccaccio, Thomas Hoccleve, William Shakespeare, and others.

Of its authorship nothing certain is known. It is conjecture to associate it either with the name of Helinandus or with that of Petrus Berchorius (Pierre Bercheure). It is debated whether it originated in England, Germany or France.

==Content==
The work was evidently intended as a manual for preachers, and was probably written by one of the clerical profession. The name, &quot;Deeds of the Romans&quot;, is only partially appropriate to the collection in its present form, since, besides the titles from Greek and Latin history and legend, it comprises fragments of different origins, Asian and European. The unifying element of the book is its moral purpose, but the work contains a variety of material. It includes, for example:

* the germ of the romance of &quot;Guy of Warwick&quot;;
* the story of the three caskets, as in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;;
* the story of &quot;Darius and his Three Sons&quot;, versified by Thomas Occleve; 
* part of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Man of Lawes Tale&quot;; 
* a version of the Crescentia cycle, similar to (though more piously phrased than) &quot;Le Bone Florence of Rome&quot;; 
* a tale of the emperor Theodosius, the same in its main features as that of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;; 
* the first known medieval appearance of the story of The Dead King and his Three Sons
* the story of the &quot;Three Black Crows&quot; 
* the &quot;Hermit and the Angel&quot;, later known from Thomas Parnell&#x27;s version;
* a story identical with the &quot;Fridolin&quot; of Schiller; 
* the story of Jonathan and the three jewels (a predecessor to &quot;Fortunatus&quot;); 
* a retelling of the &quot;Man Tried by Fate&quot;, a story also known in the legends of Saint Eustace and chivalric romances such as Sir Isumbras;
* a version of &quot;Apollonius of Tyre&quot;.

==Manuscripts==

Owing to the loose structure of the book, it was easy for a transcriber to insert any additional story into his own copy, and consequently the manuscripts of the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; exhibit considerable variety. Hermann Oesterley recognizes an English group of manuscripts (written always in Latin), a German group (sometimes in Latin and sometimes in German), and a group which is represented by the vulgate or common printed text.

==Early printed editions and translations==
The earliest printed editions are those of Nicolaus Ketelaer and Gerardus de Leempt at Utrecht, of Arnold Hoenen at Cologne, and of Ulrich Zell at Cologne; but the exact date is in all three cases uncertain. In his preface to the 1905 revised and corrected edition, Wynnard Hooper writes that &quot;according to Herr Oesterley [...] all three editions [...] appeared between 1472 and 1475.&quot;

An English translation, probably based directly on the manuscript Harl. 5369, was published by Wynkyn de Worde about 1510–15, the only copy of which now known to exist is preserved in the library of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1577 the London printer Richard Robinson published a revised edition of Wynkyn de Worde, as &quot;Certain Selected Histories for Christian Recreations&quot;, and the book proved highly popular.

Between 1648 and 1703 at least eight impressions were issued. In 1703 appeared the first vol. of a translation by BP, probably Bartholomew Pratt, from the Latin edition of 1514. A translation by the Rev. Charles Swan, first published in 2 vols in 1824, forms part of Bohn&#x27;s Antiquarian Library, and was re-edited by Wynnard Hooper in 1877 (see also the latter&#x27;s edition in 1894).

A Welsh translation was completed by Llywelyn Sion in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century.

The German translation was first printed at Augsburg, 1489. A French version, under the title of &quot;Le Violier des histoires romaines moralisez&quot;, appeared in the early part of the 16th century, and went through a number of editions; it has been reprinted by Pierre-Gustave Brunet (Paris, 1858).

== Critical Latin editions ==
Critical editions of the Latin text have been produced by Adelbert von Keller (Stuttgart, 1842) and Hermann Oesterley (Berlin, 1872). See also:

*Warton, &quot;On the Gesta Romanorum&quot;, dissertation iii., prefixed to the &quot;History of English Poetry&quot;

<doc id="1155811" wikidata="Q126963" url="?curid=1155811" title="Roa Island">
<text>Roa Island lies just over half a mile (1 km) south of the village of Rampside at the southernmost point of the Furness Peninsula in Cumbria, formerly in the county of Lancashire north of the sands. It is located at (OS grid ref. SD 233650). It is one of the Islands of Furness in northern England. It has an area of about three hectares.

Roa Island is within the unitary authority of Westmorland and Furness. The island&#x27;s population stands at around 100, making it the 15th most populated island in England.
==History==
Until 1847 Roa Island was a true island, being accessible only by boat, or on foot across the sands at low tide. John Abel Smith, a London banker, bought Roa in 1840. He built a causeway to the mainland, completed in 1846, and an 810-foot (247 m) deep-water pier known as &quot;Piel Pier&quot; from where steamers sailed to Fleetwood. The pier connected with the Furness Railway line to Kirkby via Furness Abbey, making use of the causeway. Initially the line was open for goods traffic only, but on 24 August 1846 a passenger service was inaugurated.

Over the years there was much disagreement between Smith and the Furness Railway. At one point the railway company set up its own steamer service to Piel Pier, but following a dispute with Smith, diverted the sailings to nearby Barrow. Eventually Smith was able to obtain an injunction for its return to the pier. In due course, however, Smith and the Furness Railway settled their differences and in 1852 the railway agreed to buy the lease for the entire Roa Island estate. Before the deal could be completed a freak storm caused extensive damage to the pier. This allowed the railway to buy all the rights and the property for only £15,000. Piel Pier was demolished in 1891 following changes to the course of Piel Channel which resulted in silting up of the area around the end of the pier. The railway continued in use until July 1936.

Today there is little obvious trace of it, though many of the stones that form the sides of the causeway are actually square stone sleepers from the railway. A road linking Roa Island to Rampside has now taken the place of the railway tracks along the causeway.

==Modern-day Roa Island==
Roa Island has a population of about one hundred. Despite its moderate area it boasts a yacht club, a former hotel (the &quot;Roa Island Hotel&quot; built in 1849 and originally called the &quot;Pier Hotel&quot;), and a cafe, within which enquiries can be made about the ferry to Piel Island. Overlooking the sea with a south-facing aspect is Villa Marina. This house was built for the Furness industrialist H.W. Schneider as a holiday residence. Over the years it has served as a fisheries investigation laboratory and as army premises during World War II. It is now a hotel. On the lawn are seven cannon pointing out to sea. Other interesting buildings include Trinity Terrace, a row of terraced houses built to provide accommodation for the ten Trinity House pilots; and The Watch Tower, a former Customs and Excise House built in 1847.

Roa Island is home to a lifeboat station of the RNLI, serving Morecambe Bay and the Irish Sea. The station was established in 1864 and was known at the time as Piel (Barrow). In recent years it has been completely rebuilt and enlarged.

Local people have been critical that the tourism potential of Roa Island has been little publicised, whilst other more negative aspects of the local area have been more widely documented, for example in Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Millionaire&quot;.

<text>Northwood University (NU) is a private university focused on business education with its main campus in Midland, Michigan, United States. Opened in 1959, more than 33,000 people have graduated from the institution.

==History==
Northwood University opened as Northwood Institute in 1959 by Arthur E. Turner and R. Gary Stauffer. One hundred students enrolled at the new school, which was initially located in a 19th-century mansion in Alma, Michigan. Northwood Institute moved to Midland, Michigan, in 1961.

The Jesuits operated a seminary known as West Baden College at the former West Baden Springs Hotel, in Orange County, Indiana, from 1934 until June 1964, when declining enrollment forced the closure of the facility. They sold the property to a Michigan couple, who in turn donated it to Northwood Institute, which operated a satellite campus of their business management school, Northwood University-West Baden, under the dome on the property from 1966 until 1983, when it was closed. During the same time frame during which the Indiana campus was opened, a Northwood facility was also established in Texas.

In 1982, David E. Fry became president of the school. The Florida residential campus was added and the academic curricula was expanded. The school was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

In 1993, the name was changed from &quot;Northwood Institute&quot; to Northwood University and The DeVos Graduate School of Management was created. A joint program with the Hotel Institute Montreux was established in 2001 to combine Swiss hospitality traditions with American management practices. The school, located in Montreux, Switzerland was Northwood University&#x27;s first international venture. University College program centers were expanded for a total of 40 locations in eight states and program centers were begun in Bahrain, China, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland.

In October 2007, Keith A. Pretty was named Northwood&#x27;s third President and CEO. Kent MacDonald became president in 2019.

In 2014, Northwood announced that it would close its residential operations at its Texas location, while continuing to expand its adult degree program and graduate program there. A year later in 2015, the university sold its Florida location to Keiser University.

==Academics==

Northwood focuses on business education. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates (including by distance learning), were:
::Business Administration and Management (343)
::Accounting (108)
::Marketing/Marketing Management (79)

<doc id="1155826" wikidata="Q7164382" url="?curid=1155826" title="Penny Hedge">
<text>The Penny Hedge is an ancient tradition in the English coastal town of Whitby in Yorkshire.

The legend dates back to 1159, when the Abbot of Whitby imposed a penance on three hunters, and on their descendants for all time, for murdering a hermit at Eskdale.

The hunters were following a wild boar near Whitby. When the boar took refuge in a hermitage at Eskdale, the nobles set upon the monk living there, who had closed the door on the hounds. Before he died, the monk consented to forgive them and spare their lives if they and their descendants would enact a penance.
Each year, on the eve of Ascension Day, on the east bank of the River Esk in Whitby, they had to construct a short hedge from stakes woven together, able to withstand three tides. The instructions stipulated that a knife &quot;of a penny price&quot; was to be used.

The ceremony is still performed in Whitby every year on Ascension Eve, by the occupiers of the land formerly owned by the Abbot. A horn is sounded and followed by the cry &quot;&quot;Out on ye! Out on ye! Out on ye!&quot; or &quot;Out on ye - for the heinous crime on ye&quot;&quot;. The date of the ceremony on Ascension Eve, has been taken as being 38 days from Easter Sunday. With this, it was easy to predict that the tides would be low by 9:00 am each morning as Easter Sunday is decided and regulated by the moon and the moon dictates the tides also. However, in its 858 year history, the ceremony could not be completed in 1981, due to the tide being too high. Apart from 1981, the ceremony has been carried out each year (according to available documents).

The tradition is said to have dated back to a ritual known as &quot;Horngarth&quot;. This was a requirement of tenants to maintain the hedges that divided their lands, otherwise they would forfeit them to the Abbot of Whitby. The folk-tale about the death of the hermit, has led many writers and historians to believe this was just a story attached to the tradition of the upkeep of hedges and hedgerows.

==In literature==

The Penny Hedge legend is a major plot point in the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Whitby Child&quot; by Robin Jarvis.

<text>The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is a single-player adventure gamebook written by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, and illustrated by Russ Nicholson. Originally published by Puffin Books in 1982, the title is the first gamebook in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series. It was later republished by Wizard Books in 2002, and Scholastic Books in 2017. As well as launching the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, the gamebook inspired two direct sequels and five novels, and has been adapted into a board game, an audio drama and a video game.

==Publication history==
In 1980, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone attended a Games Day, and after meeting with a Penguin editor, Philippa Dickinson, decided to create a series of single-player gamebooks. Their first submission, &quot;The Magic Quest&quot;, was a short adventure intended to demonstrate the style of game. &quot;The Magic Quest&quot; was eventually accepted by Penguin Books, although the authors devoted a further six months to expanding and improving upon the original concept.

The result was &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;, and after several rewrites, the book was accepted and published in 1982 under Penguin&#x27;s children&#x27;s imprint, Puffin Books. The original cover of the book was illustrated by Peter Andrew Jones, with the interior illustrations by Russ Nicholson. Jackson and Livingstone approved all artwork. Philippa Dickinson commissioned two more books in the same series.

The title, like the game books that followed in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series, distinguished itself by featuring a fantasy role-playing element, with the caption on each cover reading &quot;a Fighting Fantasy gamebook in which YOU become the hero!&quot; Uncertain as to how popular such a new and untried concept might prove to be, Penguin ran a first printing of just 5,000 copies. These quickly sold out, leading Penguin to do additional print runs.

The success of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series (distribution in over 17 countries) allowed for numerous reprints of the original title, although the cover of subsequent versions changed due to deliberate redesign, printing errors, and releases in different markets. When the franchise was acquired by Wizard Books in 2002, the title (as with others in the series) was the first to be reprinted, again with a completely different cover, the rationale being that the old cover did not suit the modern market.

In 2007 Wizard Books released a special 25th anniversary edition, which included supplementary material. The cover for this edition had the original picture from the 1982 edition. In 2009 Wizard Books released another edition of the original book, with yet another new cover.

In 2017 Scholastic Books began publishing &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; books, and released a new edition of &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; with new interior art as well as a new cover.

In 1984 the book was reprinted in the first two issues of &quot;Warlock&quot; magazine, with a different solution to the keys puzzle at the end and therefore a different route through the mountain.

==Rules==
==Plot==
&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; is a fantasy adventure scenario involving a quest for &quot;an untold wealth of treasure&quot; of a warlock in a dungeon.

The player takes the role of an adventurer travelling to find the treasure of a powerful Warlock, hidden deep within Firetop Mountain. People from a nearby village advise that the treasure is stored in a chest with two locks, and that the keys are guarded by various creatures within the dungeons. The player must then navigate the dungeons beneath Firetop Mountain, battle monsters and attempt to locate the keys.

==Reception==
Nicholas J R Dougan reviewed &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #36, giving it an overall rating of 10 out of 10, and stated that &quot;The book would make an ideal present for anyone who has expressed an interest in role-playing games, or indeed any young brother (or sister!). I imagine that the minimum age would be about ten, but I would recommend it to novice and veteran players alike for quite a few hours of entertainment.&quot;

In the inaugural issue of &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, John Woods found that random chance played too great a part in the game, saying, &quot;At several points a single wrong guess or unlucky dice roll spells doom for your character, and success often comes in an equally arbitrary fashion. There is little feeling of player skill having any influence on the outcome.&quot;

&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; was chosen for inclusion in &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Chris Pramas commented that the book &quot;was a pioneering release that popularized the solo gamebook and successfully brought the roleplaying game experience to a wider audience. This book alone sold over two million copies and it was only the first of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series. &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; spawned 58 more Fighting Fantasy books in the original series, a support magazine, a board game, an ambitious spinoff series, several computer games, two traditional roleplaying games, and a series of fantasy novels. Then there was the legion of imitators, another sure sign of success. Not bad for a slim paperback less than 200 pages long.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Matthew David Surridge said &quot;Modern games are more forgiving than &quot;Warlock&quot;, I think. Still, all in all, I think the book format may be best: there&#x27;s a certain effect the mix of image and text gives you that I can&#x27;t imagine in other formats. All told, I&#x27;m glad I picked the book up again. There’s magic in &quot;Firetop Mountain&quot; yet.&quot;

==Sequels==
The title was followed by two sequels, one written by Ian Livingstone. The first, &quot;Return to Firetop Mountain&quot; (the 50th title in the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series) was published in 1992 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise. The second sequel, &quot;Legend of Zagor&quot; (the 54th title in the series) was written by Carl Sargent although it was credited to Livingstone. It differed from traditional gameplay in that the player could choose one of four characters. Sargent also wrote &quot;The Zagor Chronicles&quot; which were also partly credited to Livingstone. It was a series of four novels published from 1993 to 1994. The warlock Zagor also appeared in the first &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; novel, &quot;The Trolltooth Wars&quot; (1989), by Steve Jackson.

==In other media==
A ZX Spectrum video game based on the book was released by Crystal Computing in 1984.

&quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; boardgame, designed by Steve Jackson, was released in 1986 by Games Workshop. The game is based on the book, and players must navigate a maze and overcome monsters in a bid to be the first to open the Warlock&#x27;s treasure chest.

The gamebook was also converted into a 40-page d20 System role-playing adventure by Jamie Wallis. It was published by Myriador in 2003 and reissued in pdf format by Greywood Publishing in 2008.

In 2009, Big Blue Bubble released an action-RPG for the Nintendo DS titled &quot;Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot; and based on the original title. In 2010, an electronic version of the title was released for the iPhone and iPad. When Big Blue Bubble later lost the license, all its apps were withdrawn. This gamebook has later been released by Tin Man Games.

On 10 February 2011 an Amazon Kindle edition of the title was launched by UK developer Worldweaver Ltd and in September 2011 a PSP and PlayStation 3 version was announced by UK developer Laughing Jackal.

On 30 October 2015 the Australian game developers Tin Man Games launched a Kickstarter project to develop a video game based on the book, which was released in 2016.

The gamebook was adapted into a role-playing adventure for the Advanced Fighting Fantasy system by Brett Schofield for Arion Games in 2016.

In July 2017 the British audio company FoxYason Music Productions, known for their work with Big Finish Productions, announced that they had obtained the licence to make an original audio drama based on &quot;The Warlock of Firetop Mountain&quot;. Sub-titled &#x27;The Hero&#x27;s Quest&#x27; the drama is written by David N. Smith and directed by Richard Fox and features many of the characters and locations from the original gamebook. The drama was released in September 2017 and features Toby Longworth as Zagor, Rachel Atkins as Vale Moonwing and Tim Treloar as Cassius Stormblade.

<text>A business service provider is one of several categories of service provider in the business world. As opposed to an application service provider which provides application components over a computer network, the services provided by a business service provider are more in the area of infrastructure: mail delivery, building security, finance, administration, and human services.

== Types of business service providers==

===Back Office ===
The back office operations are the off-site delivery of a range of non-core service functions, including routine administration tasks and technical support. Offshore back office operations involve the ongoing use of an outsourcing base in another country.

===Front Office ===
The front office is the part of a company that comes in contact with clients, such as the marketing, sales, and customer service department. In the hotel industry, the front office (also known as front desk) welcomes guests to the accommodation section: meeting and greeting them, taking and organizing reservations, allocating check in and out of rooms, organizing porter service, issuing keys and other security arrangements, passing on messages to customers and settling the accounts.

<doc id="1155869" wikidata="Q1227741" url="?curid=1155869" title="Thomas Hoccleve">
<text>Thomas Hoccleve or Occleve (1368/69–1426) was a key figure in 15th-century Middle English literature, significant for promoting Chaucer as &quot;the father of English literature&quot;, and as a poet in his own right. His poetry, especially his longest work, the didactic work &quot;Regement of Princes&quot;, was extremely popular in the fifteenth century, but went largely ignored until the late twentieth century, when it was re-examined by scholars, particularly John Burrow. Today he is most well known for his &quot;Series&quot;, which includes the earliest autobiographical description of mental illness in English, and for his extensive scribal activity. Three holographs of his poetry have survived, and he also copied literary manuscripts by other writers. As a clerk of the Office of the Privy Seal, he wrote hundreds of documents in French and Latin.

==Biography==
Hoccleve was born in 1368, as he states when writing in 1421 (&quot;Dialogue, 1.246&quot;) that he has seen &quot;fifty wyntir and three&quot;. Nothing is known of his family, but they probably came from the village of Hockliffe in Bedfordshire. In November 1420, Hoccleve&#x27;s fellow Privy Seal clerk John Bailey returned land and tenements in Hockliffe to him, which suggests that Hoccleve may indeed have had family ties there.

What is known of his life comes mainly from his works and from administrative records. According to the &quot;Regiment of Princes&quot; (c. 1411, 11.804–5), he obtained a clerkship in the Office of the Privy Seal at the age of eighteen or nineteen, which he retained on and off, in spite of much grumbling, for about thirty-five years. On 12 November 1399 he was granted an annuity by the new king, Henry IV. It was not always paid as regularly as he would have wished, or in full; he is known for complaining about his lack of funds.

Hoccleve is not known for his successful career. His first known, datable poem, &quot;The Letter to Cupid&quot;, was a 1402 translation of Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Epistre au Dieu d&#x27;Amours&quot;, may have been seen as inappropriately francophile in the context of the rising English nationalism of the early 15th century, which would soon result in the resumption of hostilities in the Hundred Years War. Having failed to secure a church benefice, by 1410 he had married &quot;only for love&quot; (&quot;Regiment&quot;, 1.1561) and settled down to writing moral and religious poems, including his most widely circulated poem, the &quot;Regement of Princes&quot;, which he wrote c. 1411 and dedicated to the future Henry V. He was still married in November 1420 when he and his wife receive bequests in a will. The marriage was costly for his career; married clerks were traditionally unable to hold government office, and in the political instability of the early 15th century, Henry V leaned on the legitimizing power of tradition. He appears to have been something of a loner, poor at leveraging social connections in the service of his career or personal wealth. Worse still, at some point after writing the &quot;Regiment&quot;, Hoccleve experienced a period of severe mental illness. He recovered in 1415, but writes in his &quot;Complaint&quot; (1420) that five years later he continued to experience social alienation as a result. The episode caused his voice to be &quot;publicly regarded as being unstable&quot; – a poor quality for an author whose most successful work to date was a didactic text. In &quot;Dialogue with a Friend&quot;, the poem that follows the &quot;Complaint&quot; in his &quot;Series&quot;, he describes his worsening eyesight, which further hindered his work as a scribe.

On 4 March 1426, the Exchequer rolls record a last reimbursement to Hoccleve (for red wax and ink for office use). He died soon after: on 8 May 1426 his corrody (allowance for food and clothing) at Southwick Priory in Hampshire was passed to Alice Penfold to be held &quot;in manner and form like Thomas Hoccleve now deceased&quot;.

==Work==
Hoccleve, more than any other 15th-century writer, worked to cast Chaucer as the &quot;father&quot; of English literature, acknowledging the importance of John Gower and positioning himself as an heir of this tradition. However, despite the initial runaway success of the &quot;Regiment of Princes&quot;, his popularity was soon superseded by his more prolific contemporary, John Lydgate. Later readers found the &quot;Regiment&quot; boring and overly didactic; Caxton did not print it, and it was not until the 1970s that his work came to be valued as insight into the literate culture of England under the Lancastrian regime. It is especially valued by contemporary scholars for his frank autobiographical descriptions, in particular his description of his mental illness in the &quot;Complaint and Dialogue&quot; (1420). His &quot;La Male Regle&quot; (c. 1406), one of his most fluid and lively works, is a mock-penitential poem that gives some glimpses of dissipation in his youth.

His diction is relatively simple and clear; as a metrist he is self-deprecating. While he confesses that &quot;Fader Chaucer fayn wolde han me taught, But I was dul and learned lite or naught&quot;, this pose was conventional in Hoccleve&#x27;s time, and an inheritance from Chaucer himself, whose alter-ego Geoffrey was portrayed as fat and dimwitted in &quot;The House of Fame&quot; and &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Later known as the &quot;humility topos&quot;, the posture would become a conventional form of authorial self-presentation in the Renaissance.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites Hoccleve as the first recorded user of many words, including &quot;annuity&quot;, &quot;causative&quot;, &quot;flexible&quot;, &quot;innate&quot;, &quot;interrupt&quot;, &quot;manual&quot;, &quot;miserable&quot;, &quot;notice&quot;, &quot;obtain&quot;, &quot;pitiless&quot;, &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;suspense&quot;.

=== The &quot;Regiment of Princes&quot; ===
The &quot;Regement of Princes&quot;, written for Henry V of England shortly before his accession, is a homily on virtues and vices, adapted from Aegidius de Colonna&#x27;s Latin work of the same name, from a supposed epistle of Aristotle known as &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot;, and from a work of Jacques de Cessoles (fl. 1300) translated later by Caxton as &quot;The Game and Playe of Chesse&quot;. The &quot;Regement&quot; survives in at least 43 manuscript copies. It comments on Henry V&#x27;s lineage, to cement the House of Lancaster&#x27;s claim to England&#x27;s throne. Its proem, occupying about a third of the whole, contains reminiscences of London tavern life in a dialogue between the poet and an old man.

=== The &quot;Series&quot; ===
The &quot;Series&quot;, which combines autobiographical poetry, poetic translations and prose moralizations of the translated texts, begins (&quot;Complaint&quot;, 11.40 ff.) with a description of a period of &quot;wylde infirmitee&quot;, in which the Hoccleve-character claims he temporarily lost his &quot;wit&quot; and &quot;memorie&quot; (this stands as the earliest autobiographical description of mental illness in English). He describes recovering from this &quot;five years ago last All Saints&quot; (&quot;Complaint&quot;, 11.55–6) but still experiencing social alienation as a result of gossip about this insanity. The &quot;Series&quot; continues with &quot;Dialog with a Friend,&quot; which claims to be written after his recovery and gives a pathetic picture of a poor poet, now 53, with sight and mind impaired. In it he tells the unnamed friend of his plans to write a tale he owes to his good patron, Humphrey of Gloucester, and of translating a portion of Henry Suso&#x27;s popular Latin treatise on the art of dying – a task the friend discourages, saying that too much study was the cause of his mental illness. The &quot;Series&quot; then fulfils this plan, continuing with moralized tales of &quot;Jereslaus&#x27; Wife&quot; and of &quot;Jonathas&quot; (both from &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;). The &quot;Series&quot; next turns to &quot;Learn to die&quot;, a theologically and psychologically astute verse translation of Henry Suso&#x27;s Latin prose &quot;Ars Moriendi&quot; (Book II, Chapter 2 of the &quot;Horologium Sapientiae&quot;). The theme of mortality and strict calendar structure of the &quot;Series&quot; link the sequence to the death of Hoccleve&#x27;s friend and Privy Seal colleague John Bailey in November 1420. Two autograph manuscripts of the &quot;Series&quot; survive.

==Handwriting==
Hoccleve has left behind more manuscripts and documents in his own hand than any other known medieval English writer. Four literary manuscripts are generally considered to have been solely or mostly in his hand;

* Durham University Library, Cosin MS V. iii. 9 (&quot;The Series&quot;)
* San Marino, Huntington Library MSS HM 111 and HM 744 (collections of his shorter poems). 
* London, British Library, MS Harley 219 (in Hoccleve&#x27;s hand are extracts from the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, some of Odo of Cheriton&#x27;s &quot;Fable&quot;s, Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;Epistre Othea&quot;, and a trilingual glossary of French terms into Latin and/or English)

His hand has also been identified in sections of other literary manuscripts, as a copyist and/or corrector. He is Scribe E in Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.3.2, John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;; this manuscript includes work by four other scribes, including the prolific copyist Scribe D, and Scribe B, the copyist of the Ellesmere and Hengwrt manuscripts of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. He may also be Hand F of the latter manuscript, who copied a few lines; it has been suggested that he was the first editor of Chaucer&#x27;s work. Hoccleve also wrote out the majority of the Privy Seal Formulary, British Library, MS Add. 24062, and wrote hundreds of documents in his capacity as a Privy Seal clerk.

==Editions==
Hoccleve found a 17th-century admirer in William Browne, who included his &quot;Jonathas&quot; in &quot;Shepheard&#x27;s Pipe&quot; (1614). Browne added a eulogy of the poet, whose works he intended to publish in their entirety (Works, ed. W. C. Hazlitt, 1869, ii. f 96–198). In 1796 George Mason printed &quot;Six Poems by Thomas Hoccleve never before printed&quot;. &quot;De Regimine Principum&quot; was printed for the Roxburghe Club in 1860 and by Early English Text Society in 1897. (See Frederick James Furnivall&#x27;s introduction to Hoccleve&#x27;s Works; I. &quot;The Minor Poems&quot;, in the Phillipps manuscript 8131, and the Durham manuscript III. p, Early English Text Society, 1892.)

Furnivall&#x27;s edition of Hoccleve&#x27;s complete works, still largely standard for scholars, was reprinted in the 1970s; however, Michael Seymour&#x27;s &quot;Selections from Hoccleve&quot;, published by the Clarendon Press (a division of Oxford University Press) in 1981, provides an excellent sampling of the poet&#x27;s major and minor works for readers seeking a sense of Hoccleve&#x27;s work. J. A. Burrow&#x27;s 1999 Early English Text Society edition of Thomas Hoccleve&#x27;s &quot;Complaint and Dialogue&quot; is becoming the standard edition of the two excerpts from the Hoccleve&#x27;s later works (collectively known as &quot;The Series&quot;), as is Charles Blyth&#x27;s TEAMS Middle English Text Series edition of &quot;The Regiment of Princes&quot; from the same year – particularly for modernised spelling that facilitates use in the classroom. These three recent editions all have introductions offering a thorough sense of a poet hitherto under-appreciated.

<text>Bonnie Raitt is the debut album by Bonnie Raitt, released in 1971.

==Background==
The album was recorded at an empty summer camp on Enchanted Island, about 15 miles west of Minneapolis on Lake Minnetonka in August 1971. This location was chosen because of Raitt&#x27;s close friendship with John Koerner and Dave Ray, two musicians from Minneapolis who were playing on the East Coast folk circuit. Koerner and Ray encouraged Raitt to check out Minneapolis for the location of her first recording. &quot;We recorded live on four tracks because we wanted a more spontaneous and natural feeling in the music&quot;, Raitt wrote in the album&#x27;s liner notes, &quot;a feeling often sacrificed when the musicians know they can overdub their part on a separate track until it&#x27;s perfect.&quot;

==Reception==

Though album sales were modest, &quot;Bonnie Raitt&quot; was warmly received by rock critics. &quot;[A]n unusual collection of songs performed by an unusual assortment of musicians&quot;, wrote &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;Raitt is a folkie by history but not by aesthetic&quot;, wrote Robert Christgau in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column. &quot;She includes songs from Steve Stills, the Marvelettes, and a classic feminist blues singer named Sippie Wallace because she knows the world doesn&#x27;t end with acoustic song-poems and Fred McDowell. An adult repertoire that rocks with a steady roll, and she&#x27;s all of twenty-one years old.&quot;

<doc id="1155876" wikidata="Q2268" url="?curid=1155876" title="Old Nubian">
<text>Old Nubian (also called Middle Nubian or Old Nobiin) is an extinct Nubian language, attested in writing from the 8th to the 15th century AD. It is ancestral to modern-day Nobiin and closely related to Dongolawi and Kenzi. It was used throughout the kingdom of Makuria, including the eparchy of Nobatia. The language is preserved in more than a hundred pages of documents and inscriptions, both of a religious nature (homilies, prayers, hagiographies, psalms, lectionaries), and related to the state and private life (legal documents, letters), written using adaptation of the Coptic alphabet.

==History==

Old Nubian, according to historical linguists, was the spoken language of the oldest inhabitants of the Nile valley. Adams, Berhens, Griffith and Bechhause-Gerst agree that Nile Nubian has its origins in the Nile valley.

Old Nubian is one of the oldest written African languages and appears to have been adopted from the 10th–11th century as the main language for the civil and religious administration of Makuria. Besides Old Nubian, Koine Greek was widely used, especially in religious contexts, while Coptic mainly predominates in funerary inscriptions. Over time, more and more Old Nubian began to appear in both secular and religious documents (including the Bible), while several grammatical aspects of Greek, including the case, agreement, gender, and tense morphology underwent significant erosion. The consecration documents found with the remains of archbishop Timotheos suggest, however, that Greek and Coptic continued to be used into the late 14th century, by which time Arabic was also in widespread use.

==Writing==
The script in which nearly all Old Nubian texts have been written is a slanted uncial variant of the Coptic alphabet, originating from the White Monastery in Sohag. The alphabet included three additional letters and , and , the first two deriving from the Meroitic alphabet. The presence of these characters suggest that although the first written evidence of Old Nubian dates to the 8th century, the script must have already been developed in the 6th century, following the collapse of the Meroitic state. Additionally, Old Nubian used the variant for the Coptic letter .

The characters only appear in Greek loanwords. Gemination was indicated by writing double consonants; long vowels were usually not distinguished from short ones. Old Nubian featured two digraphs: and . A diaeresis over () was used to indicate the semivowel . In addition, Old Nubian featured a supralinear stroke, which could indicate:
* a vowel that formed the beginning of a syllable or was preceded by ;
* an /i/ preceding a consonant.

Modern Nobiin is a tonal language; if Old Nubian was tonal as well, the tones were not marked.

Punctuation marks included a high dot •, sometimes substituted by a double backslash \\ (), which was used roughly like an English period or colon; a slash / (), which was used like a question mark; and a double slash // (), which was sometimes used to separate verses.

In 2021, the first modern Nubian typeface based on the style of text written in old Nubian manuscripts called Sawarda was released designed by Hatim-Arbaab Eujayl for a series of educational books teaching Nobiin.

==Grammar==
===Nouns===
Old Nubian has no gender. The noun consists of a stem to which derivational suffixes may be added. Plural markers, case markers, postpositions, and the determiner are added on the entire noun phrase, which may also comprise adjectives, possessors, and relative clauses.

====Determination====
Old Nubian has one definite determiner . The precise function of this morpheme has been a matter of controversy, with some scholars proposing it as nominative case or subjective marker. Both the distribution of the morpheme and comparative evidence from Meroitic, however, point to a use as determiner.

====Case====
Old Nubian has a nominative-accusative case system with four structural cases determining the core arguments in the sentence, as well as a number of lexical cases for adverbial phrases.

====Number====
The most common plural marker is , which always precedes case marking. There are a few irregular plurals, such as:
: , pl. &quot;man&quot;
: , pl. &quot;child&quot;

Furthermore, there are traces of separate animate plural forms in , which are textually limited to a few roots, e.g.
: &quot;Christians&quot;
: &quot;dogs&quot;

===Pronouns===
Old Nubian has several sets of pronouns and subject clitics are the following, of which the following are the main ones:
There are two demonstrative pronouns:
: , pl. &quot;this&quot;
: , pl. &quot;that&quot;

Interrogative words include &quot;who?&quot;; &quot;what?&quot;; and a series of question words based on the root .

===Verbs===
The Old Nubian verbal system is by far the most complex part of its grammar, allowing for valency, tense, mood, aspect, person and pluractionality to be expressed on it through a variety of suffixes.

The main distinction between nominal and verbal predicates in a main clause versus a subordinate clause is indicated by the presence of the predicate marker . The major categories, listing from the root of the verb to the right, are as follows:

====Valency====
====Pluractionality====
====Aspect====
====Tense====
====Person====
This can be indicated by a series of subject clitics, which are obligatory only in certain grammatical contexts. They are generally absent when an overt subject is present in the clause, unless the subject has the topic marker -ⲉⲓⲟⲛ.

<doc id="1155877" wikidata="Q240864" url="?curid=1155877" title="Rothesay, New Brunswick">
<text>Rothesay () is a suburban town located in Kings County, New Brunswick, Canada. Located within Saint John&#x27;s metropolitan area, it borders the town of Quispamsis to form the Kennebecasis Valley and is located along the lower Kennebecasis River. As of 2021, the population of Rothesay was 11,977.

==Geography==
Located along the lower Kennebecasis River valley, Rothesay borders the city of Saint John to the southwest, and the neighbouring town of Quispamsis to the northeast. It is served by a secondary mainline of the Canadian National Railway, though there is no longer any passenger service on the line.

==History==
The town of Rothesay developed first as a shipbuilding centre and later as a summer home community for Saint John&#x27;s wealthy elite with the arrival of the European and North American Railway in 1853. There is a commonly known story that the new town was named in honour of the visiting Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, in 1860 because the area was said to have reminded him of Rothesay, on the Isle of Bute, in Scotland.

However, an entry made in the diary of William Franklin Bunting, of Saint John, during the same visit refers to the Rothesay train station. It is unlikely that the name would have taken hold less than a day after the prince&#x27;s passage through the settlement and so it likely predates the visit or was specifically bestowed on the town in the prince&#x27;s honour as Duke of Rothesay. In 1870, a Saint John-owned ship named &quot;Rothesay&quot; made a famous voyage when a 20-year-old woman named Bessie Hall took command of the fever-stricken ship and sailed it from Florida to Liverpool, England.

==Present day==
Many historical landmarks are located in the town of Rothesay, such as the Rothesay Common, the Rothesay Yacht Club, the former train station (one of the last remaining examples of early railway architecture in Canada), many homes that pre-date Confederation, public parks and modern amenities. The community provides numerous places of worship and recreation, along with the convenience of local retail and large-scale commercial developments in the nearby city of Saint John. Police services are provided by Kennebecasis Regional Police Force.

Rothesay lies in the Anglophone South School District. Schools include Rothesay Park School, Rothesay High School, Rothesay Netherwood School, and Fairvale Elementary School. Rothesay was formerly the headquarters of New Brunswick School District 06; both New Brunswick Route 100 and New Brunswick Route 111 run through the town and connect with New Brunswick Route 1. The city is served by Saint John Transit.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rothesay had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Amalgamation==
Following the December 1992 release of a government discussion paper entitled &quot;Strengthening Municipal Government in New Brunswick&#x27;s Urban Centres&quot;, a series of localized feasibility studies were commissioned by the Frank McKenna Liberals targeting six geographic areas: Edmunston, Campbellton, Dalhousie, Miramichi, Moncton, and Saint John. In each instance, a panel composed of local representatives and expert consulting staff made specific recommendations for each urban-centred region. The report for the Greater Saint John area, &quot;A Community of Communities: Creating a stronger future&quot; - often referred to simply as the Cormier Report - offered two potential solutions to the Province for consolidating the many municipalities in Greater Saint John, neither of which was ultimately adopted by government. 

Option one offered by the Cormier Report was to create three communities with regionalization of some services. Under this option, the six Kennebecasis Valley communities (East Riverside-Kinghurst, Fairvale, Gondola Point, Quispamsis, Renforth, and Rothesay) plus the local service district of the Parish of Rothesay would be consolidated into one new municipality. The Town of Grand Bay and various unincorporated areas around Saint John would also be consolidated into the City of Saint John to form the second new municipality. The third municipality in this scenario would be Westfield, which would remain separate because it was more rural and less populated. In this scenario, many services including water and sewerage, planning, and economic development would be regionalized across the three municipalities. 

The second option offered by Cormier was a full consolidation of eight of the existing communities into one new city. In this scenario, only Westfield would remain a separate municipality. Full consolidation was unpopular among residents outside the City of Saint John. Suburban residents stated generally that they were pleased with their communities as they were and that they liked their lower tax rates. As Cormier summarized it, residents &quot;perceive Saint John as an expensive, poorly managed bureaucracy that does not serve its citizens well. They fear loss of control, loss of services, and loss of neighbourhood friendliness and sense of community.&quot; Suburban residents&#x27; comments at public meetings support this description. One Fairvale resident stated that he resented the questionnaire Commissioner Cormier had circulated to residents that asked them to rank their order of preference for his five reorganization schemes because it meant that the worst that full amalgamation could do is fifth place. As the resident put it, &quot;full amalgamation into one city would come about three million, nine hundred and fifty-sixth on anybody&#x27;s choice. That would come just above amalgamation with Red China.&quot; 

Ultimately, neither of the two options was implemented. Rather, the provincial government chose to proceed with partial consolidations and opted to legislate cost sharing for five specific regional facilities. On January 1, 1998, the former incorporated villages of East Riverside-Kinghurst, Fairvale, and Renforth; the town of Rothesay; and part of the community of Wells in the local service district of the Rothesay Parish were amalgamated to form the town of Rothesay. The town motto, &quot;Quinque luncta In Uno&quot; (Five United In One), represents the joining together of the five founding communities.

Occasional discussion about the possibility of further amalgamating Rothesay with Quispamsis has not proceeded beyond the discussion phase, though the two municipalities do collaborate extensively to share services and facilities. Notably, both towns&#x27; boundaries were also left largely unaltered by the strategic restructuring undertaken during the Higgs-Allain Local Governance Reforms.

<text>Thomas Helliker (sometimes spelled Hilliker) (23 March 1784 – 22 March 1803), known as the Trowbridge Martyr, was a figure in early English trade union history who was hanged, aged 19, for his alleged role in machine-breaking at a Wiltshire woollen mill. His conviction has been challenged as controversial and faulty, and he is now regarded as a victim of anti-Luddite sentiment.

==Arrest and trial==
Helliker had been employed as a shearman&#x27;s colt at a woollen mill owned by a Mr Naish at Semington, near Trowbridge in Wiltshire. As such he was close to the most highly skilled workers who stood to lose most from mechanisation and therefore were well-organised in resisting it. 

The workers had organised an anti-machinery mill-burning riot that destroyed the mill on 22 July 1802 and Helliker was accused of waving a pistol at a night-watchman during this attack. Heath, the tenant of the mill, witnessed this attack and gave a description similar to Helliker&#x27;s to a police officer, Read; furthermore, Helliker had been heard praising the attacks on the machines. He was arrested in Trowbridge on 3 August 1802. Heath later picked him out in an identification parade although Helliker was the only mill employee in the line-up and already known to him. He was taken before the magistrates and denied the offence, however the magistrate, Mr Jones told him Despite Helliker having an alibi from his friend Joseph Warren, to the effect that they had both got drunk on the night in question and had locked themselves inside a house until the morning, he was charged and lodged in Salisbury gaol.

Thomas Helliker was tried in Salisbury despite the fact that many people at the time believed his statements that he was innocent, and tried to get him to name the actual culprit. He refused to do so; Warren failed to attend the court to support the alibi, having been taken to Yorkshire by colleagues who had felt that he would not withstand questioning. The only evidence against Helliker was that of Heath&#x27;s identification, although he had also been given £500, a very large sum at that time, as a reward. Helliker&#x27;s counsel, a Mr Garrow, failed to undermine Heath&#x27;s identification, and a newspaper report of the time said 

Helliker was hanged on his 19th birthday; his colleagues claimed his body and carried it across Salisbury Plain back to Trowbridge. On 22 March 2003, the anniversary of his hanging was marked by a ceremony by the side of his tomb, and it was then said that 

==Final letter==
A handwritten copy of the last letter written by Helliker (signed Hiliker) is on display at Trowbridge Museum. In 2010 it was selected as one of 100 objects in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;A History of the World&quot; project, in partnership with the British Museum and 350 museums and institutions across the country.

==Tomb==
Helliker&#x27;s tomb is in the churchyard of St James&#x27;s Church, Trowbridge, a short distance from the town centre.

A second inscription was added later:

He dressed the officer&#x27;s wounds under heavy fire from the enemy, and by stopping a severe haemorrhage, helped to save his life.

His citation reads:
==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Mytchett, Surrey.

<text>The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) is an independent research and campaigning charity founded and based in the United Kingdom. It works to enable homes, places and communities in which everyone can thrive, informed by the Garden City Principles. 

==History==

Founded by Sir Ebenezer Howard in 1899 to promote the idea of the Garden City, the TCPA is Britain&#x27;s oldest charity concerned with planning, housing and the environment.

The association was first called the Garden City Association, and then the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association, broadening its scope to promote town planning as well as garden cities. It is the first pressure group for planning and predates the formation of the Royal Town Planning Institute.

Women played an active role in the TCPA. Sir Ebenezer Howard said in Garden Cities of To-morrow: &quot;Woman&#x27;s influence is too often ignored. When the Garden City is built, as it shortly will be, woman&#x27;s share in the work will be found to have been a large one. Women are among our most active missionaries&quot;. In 1903 the TCPA included a &#x27;Women&#x27;s League&#x27;. In 1920 a &#x27;Women&#x27;s Section&#x27; had been established. Two members of the &#x27;Women&#x27;s Section&#x27; founded the Women&#x27;s Pioneer Housing, Etheldred Browning and Sydney Bushell.

==Vision and values==

The TCPA has been a reformist movement for over a hundred years – evidenced by its interest in fair shares in development and land value uplift; shared ownership of public open space; participative and entrepreneurial local governance; town and country planned together, and enhancement of the environment – and the need to achieve sustainable communities. 

Informed by the Garden City Principles, the TCPA’s strategic priorities are to: 

* Work to secure a good home for everyone in inclusive, resilient and prosperous communities, which support people to live healthier lives.
* Empower people to have real influence over decisions about their environments and to secure social justice within and between communities.
* Support new and transform existing places to be adaptable to current and future challenges including the climate crisis.

==Activities==
As part of its educational remit, the TCPA arranges conferences and study tours. The association is not only confined to England but is also involved in a range of European projects.

==Work areas==

===Garden cities and new towns ===
Building on its legacy, the TCPA has been setting out a proactive agenda around garden cities, with a positive response from the government.
The association believes that a new generation of 21st-century garden cities could help to solve a range of problems such as the acute shortage of housing in the UK and the need to respond to climate change
Recently, the Prime Minister has made a statement outlining his support of the garden principles and drafted a prospectus on locally led garden cities. Ebbsfleet has been proposed as a potential new garden city. However, although the site is well-connected it is difficult to see how it could meet all of the Garden City Principles but must genuinely offer affordable homes, according to the TCPA.

===Climate change===
The TCPA undertakes research, policy formulation and political influence on climate adaptation and mitigation in the context of spatial planning. This is informed by both UK research and European-funded projects on adaptation, green infrastructure, human health and energy. European-funded projects on climate change adaptation led by the TCPA include Clim-Cap, GRaBs and PERFECT.

The Planning &amp; Climate Change Coalition, which has been brought together by Friends of the Earth and the TCPA, includes over 60 cross-sector organisations and individuals. The Coalition has worked to ensure that the planning system makes a full contribution to meeting the climate change challenge. They have developed planning guidance and model policies on climate change for local authorities in England. The aim of the Coalition is to build a consensus among a wide range of stakeholders on the benefits of guidance on planning for climate change, working with local authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships and communities. The Coalition has no core funding and no political or corporate affiliations.

=== Community participation and social justice ===
The TCPA works with government and the private sector to campaign for meaningful public participation in the planning and development process. It also supports communities getting engaged in UK planning. This includes a partnership with planning advice charity Planning Aid for London (PAL).

=== Healthy place-making ===
The Garden City movement sought to promote the fact that the way places are planned, designed, built and managed has a significant influence over whether communities are able to live healthy lives. Today, the TCPA continues to promote the creation of healthy places through the publication of research, reports and guidance on issues such as 20-minute neighbourhoods (sometimes referred to as the 15-minute city)

=== Parks and Green Infrastructure ===
The TCPA has been promoting the inclusion of green spaces in urban areas for over 100 years, as a core principle of the original Garden City movement. Today it manages the Green Infrastructure Partnership, a network of over, 2000 members which shares information about the latest green infrastructure policies and project across the UK. The GIP was launched by DEFRA in 2011 and was taken over by the TCPA in April 2014. The TCPA also works on a number of projects on green infrastructure including the EU funded PERFECT project which aims to improve green infrastructure policy across Europe by promoting the multiple benefits that green infrastructure can provide.

==Publications==

The monthly journal Town &amp; Country Planning publishes a range of reports that highlights the range of their work.

<doc id="1155924" wikidata="Q5464106" url="?curid=1155924" title="Foggy River Boys">
<text>The Foggy River Boys was the name of two related American male singing quartets from southern Missouri specializing in Southern gospel, spiritual, and country music in the 1940s and 1950s.

==1940s group==

The original Foggy River Boys traced their lineage to the early 1940s, when Bill and Monty Matthews, joined by their brothers Jack and Matt, formed the Matthews Brothers in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. All were ordained ministers for Disciples of Christ. They had two daily live shows on KWTO-AM in Springfield, Missouri.

In 1947, they appeared with Red Foley on &quot;The Prince Albert Show&quot;, the nationally broadcast portion of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee. Matt and Jack left in 1948 to become full-time preachers, and were replaced by Bob Hubbard, also a minister, and bass singer Cully Holt. They first called the new group the Melodizing Matthews, but changed the name to The Jordanaires, after the Jordan Creek in Springfield, Missouri. They signed with RCA Records, and recorded secular music under the name The Foggy River Boys (after a nickname for the Cumberland River). In 1952, piano player Gordon Stoker replaced Bill Matthews as first tenor, Hoyt Hawkins replaced Hubbard and Neal Matthews Jr. (no relation) replaced Monty Matthews, forming the version of the Jordanaires who went on to back Elvis Presley.

==1950s group==

The second iteration of The Foggy River Boys formed in Springfield about 1954 with Charlie Hutton as lead vocalist, with brothers Bill and Monty Matthews, Warren Holmes as bass vocalist, and Bill Hedrick as piano accompanist. By the end of the first season on the &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, Charlie Hodge had replaced Charlie Hutton, Don Taylor had replaced Warren Holmes, and Newman Miller had replaced Bill Hedrick at piano. Hodge was replaced by George Richardson in 1958. They were signed to Decca Records and also recorded on the Mercury, Starday, and Foremost Records labels. They backed Fess Parker, Homer and Jethro, Red Foley, and Bobby Lord.

Les Roberson, replacing Monty Matthews, joined in 1957. That year, they changed their name to The Marksmen, which by then consisted of Roberson (baritone), Richardson (lead), Earl Terry (tenor), and Don Taylor (bass). Robertson, Richardson and Terry were from Los Angeles; Taylor was from Lakeland, Florida. They were regulars on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; from 1955 to 1960, and also appeared on &quot;The Eddy Arnold Show&quot; in 1956 and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot; in 1961. In May 1957, they performed on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Tennessee Ernie Ford Show&quot; and Cliffie Stone&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Jamboree&quot; in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1155941" wikidata="Q3758414" url="?curid=1155941" title="Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington">
<text>Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington (19 July 1735 – 22 May 1781) was an Anglo-Irish politician and composer and the father of several distinguished military commanders and politicians of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Early life==
Wesley was born at the family estate of Dangan Castle, near Summerhill, a village near Trim in County Meath, Ireland. He was a son of Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington (son of Henry Colley, MP), and Elizabeth Sale (a daughter of John Sale, Registrar of the Diocese of Dublin).

He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, and was elected its first Professor of Music in 1764. From early childhood he showed extraordinary talent on the violin, and soon began composing his own works. It was the future Duke of Wellington who, alone of his children, inherited something of his musical talent.

==Political career==
Wesley represented Trim in the Irish House of Commons from 1757 until 1758, when he succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Mornington. In 1759 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Meath and in 1760, in recognition of his musical and philanthropic achievements, he was created Viscount Wellesley, of Dangan Castle in the County of Meath, and Earl of Mornington.

He was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1776, a post he held until the following year. Like his father, and his mother-in-law Lady Dungannon, he was careless with money, and his early death left the family exposed to financial embarrassment, leading ultimately to the decision in the nineteenth century to sell all their Irish estates.

==Musical compositions==
As a composer, Lord Mornington is remembered chiefly for glees such as &quot;Here in cool grot&quot; (lyrics by William Shenstone) and some Anglican chant. But he also composed some large-scale music such as the five-act opera &quot;Caractacus&quot; (libretto by William Mason), first performed at the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley, Dublin on 26 March 1764, and the &quot;Ode for the Installation of the Duke of Bedford&quot; at Trinity College Dublin, 9 September 1768, for choir and orchestra, of which only an orchestral march survives.

In music he is also remembered as one of co-founders, with Kane O&#x27;Hara and Francis Ireland, of a Musical Academy in late 1757, which lasted about twenty years. This was a concert-giving society for amateurs where he directed the choir and orchestra.

==Personal life==
Lord Mornington married Anne Hill-Trevor, eldest daughter of the banker Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, and his wife Anne Stafford, on 6 February 1759. His godmother, the famous diarist Mary Delany, said the marriage was happy, despite his lack of financial sense and her &quot;want of judgment&quot;. They had nine children, most of whom were historically significant, including:

* Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley (1760–1842), married firstly Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland, daughter of Pierre Roland, in 1794; married secondly Marianne Caton, daughter of Richard Caton, in 1825
* Hon. Arthur Gerald Wesley (d. 1768)
* William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington (1763–1845), married Katherine Forbes, daughter of Admiral John Forbes and maternal granddaughter of William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex, in 1784
* Hon. Francis Wesley (1767–1770)
* Lady Anne Wesley (1768–1844), married firstly Henry FitzRoy, younger son of Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton (descendant of an illegitimate son of Charles II); married secondly Charles Culling Smith
* Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769–1852), who married Hon. Catherine Pakenham, daughter of Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford, in 1806
* The Rev. Hon. Gerald Valerian Wellesley (1770–1848), married Lady Emily Cadogan, eldest daughter of Charles Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan
* Lady Mary Elizabeth Wesley (1772–1794)
* Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley (1773–1847), married firstly Lady Charlotte Cadogan, second daughter of the 1st Earl Cadogan, in 1803; divorced by Act of Parliament in 1810, and married secondly Lady Georgiana Cecil, daughter of James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury, in 1816

Four of Lord Mornington&#x27;s five sons were created peers in the peerages of Great Britain and the United Kingdom. The Barony of Wellesley (held by the Marquess Wellesley) and the Barony of Maryborough are now extinct, whilst the Dukedom of Wellington and Barony of Cowley are extant. The Earldom of Mornington is held by the Dukes of Wellington, and the Barons Cowley have since been elevated to be Earls Cowley.

==Legacy==
Four streets in Camden Town, which formed part of the estate of his son-in-law Henry FitzRoy, were named Mornington Crescent, Place, Street and Terrace after him. Of these, the first has since become famous as the name of a London Underground station.

<text>Elmer is a coastal village in the Arun district of West Sussex, England. It is part of the built-up area around Bognor Regis. Its postal address is &quot;Elmer, Bognor Regis&quot;. In the small shopping area are the local shop, launderette, Indian restaurant and estate agents, along with two pubs The Cabin and The Elmer.

The area also includes the hamlet of Ancton, centred on Ancton Farm, which is considerably older than Elmer, which has only been developed within the last 50 years.

The whole area of Elmer used to be farmland until the housing drive of the postwar years when the Elmer Sands Estate was constructed. Much of the original housing in the Elmer Sands estate consisted of old railway carriages; over the years these are being replaced by modern housing.

The beach at Elmer [Elmer Sands] is like most West Sussex beaches, pebbles at high tide and sand at mid to low tide with the beach divided by wooden groynes.

During the early 19th century Damien Cox, a British Archeologist, discovered the fossilized remains of a Sus domesticus whilst excavating in the beach area. The fossils are now held in the local village post office, where visitors can purchase postcards and other local memorabilia.

<doc id="1155952" wikidata="Q1122556" url="?curid=1155952" title="Computer reservation system">
<text>Computer reservation systems, or central reservation systems (CRS), are computerized systems used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel, hotels, car rental, or other activities. Originally designed and operated by airlines, CRSs were later extended for use by travel agencies, and global distribution systems (GDSs) to book and sell tickets for multiple airlines. Most airlines have outsourced their CRSs to GDS companies, which also enable consumer access through Internet gateways.

Modern GDSs typically also allow users to book hotel rooms, rental cars, airline tickets as well as other activities and tours. They also provide access to railway reservations and bus reservations in some markets, although these are not always integrated with the main system. These are also used to relay computerized information for users in the hotel industry, making reservation and ensuring that the hotel is not overbooked.

Airline reservations systems may be integrated into a larger passenger service system, which also includes an airline inventory system and a departure control system. The current centralised reservation systems are vulnerable to network-wide system disruptions.

== History ==
=== MARS-1 ===
The MARS-1 train ticket reservation system was designed and planned in the 1950s by the Japanese National Railways&#x27; R&amp;D Institute, now the Railway Technical Research Institute, with the system eventually being produced by Hitachi in 1958. It was the world&#x27;s first seat reservation system for trains. The MARS-1 was capable of reserving seat positions, and was controlled by a transistor computer with a central processing unit and a 400,000-bit magnetic drum memory unit to hold seating files. It used many registers, to indicate whether seats in a train were vacant or reserved to accelerate searches of and updates to seat patterns, for communications with terminals, printing reservation notices, and CRT displays.

=== Remote access ===
In 1953 Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA) started investigating a computer-based system with remote terminals, testing one design on the University of Toronto&#x27;s Ferranti Mark 1 machine that summer. Though successful, the researchers found that input and output was a major problem. Ferranti Canada became involved in the project and suggested a new system using punched cards and a transistorized computer in place of the unreliable tube-based Mark I. The resulting system, ReserVec, started operation in 1962, and took over all booking operations in January 1963. Terminals were placed in all of TCA&#x27;s ticketing offices, allowing all queries and bookings to complete in about one second with no remote operators needed.

In 1953 American Airlines CEO C. R. Smith chanced to sit next to R. Blair Smith, a senior IBM sales representative, on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. C.R. invited Blair to visit their Reservisor system and look for ways that IBM could improve the system. Blair alerted Thomas Watson Jr. that American was interested in a major collaboration, and a series of low-level studies started. Their idea of an automated airline reservation system (ARS) resulted in a 1959 venture known as the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE), launched the following year. By the time the network was completed in December 1964, it was the largest civil data processing system in the world.

Other airlines established their own systems. Pan Am launched its PANAMAC system in 1964. Delta Air Lines launched the Delta Automated Travel Account System (DATAS) in 1968. United Airlines and Trans World Airlines followed in 1971 with the Apollo Reservation System and Programmed Airline Reservation System (PARS), respectively. Soon, travel agents began pushing for a system that could automate their side of the process by accessing the various ARSes directly to make reservations. Fearful this would place too much power in the hands of agents, American Airlines executive Robert Crandall proposed creating an industry-wide computer reservation system to be a central clearing house for U.S. travel; other airlines demurred, citing fear that United States antitrust law may have been breached.

=== Travel agent access ===
In 1976, United Airlines began offering its Apollo system to travel agents; while it would not allow the agents to book tickets on United&#x27;s competitors, the marketing value of the convenient terminal proved indispensable. SABRE, PARS, and DATAS were soon released to travel agents as well. Following airline deregulation in 1978, an efficient CRS proved particularly important; by some counts, Texas Air executive Frank Lorenzo purchased money-losing Eastern Air Lines specifically to gain control of its SystemOne CRS.

Also in 1976 Videcom international with British Airways, British Caledonian and CCL launched Travicom, the world&#x27;s first multi-access reservations system (wholly based on Videcom technology), forming a network providing distribution for initially two and subsequently 49 subscribing international airlines (including British Airways, British Caledonian, Trans World Airlines, Pan Am, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines System, Air Canada, KLM, Alitalia, Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987. The system went on to be replicated by Videcom in other areas of the world including the Middle East (DMARS), New Zealand, Kuwait (KMARS), Ireland, Caribbean, United States and Hong Kong. Travicom was a trading name for Travel Automation Services Ltd. When British Airways (who by then owned 100% of Travel Automation Services Ltd) chose to participate in the development of the Galileo system Travicom changed its trading name to Galileo UK and a migration process was put in place to move agencies from Travicom to Galileo.

European airlines also began to invest in the field in the 1980s initially by deploying their own reservation systems in their homeland, propelled by growth in demand for travel as well as technological advances which allowed GDSes to offer ever-increasing services and searching power. In 1987, a consortium led by Air France and West Germany&#x27;s Lufthansa developed Amadeus, modeled on SystemOne. Amadeus Global Travel Distribution was launched in 1992. In 1990, Delta, Northwest Airlines, and Trans World Airlines formed Worldspan, and in 1993, another consortium (including British Airways, KLM, and United Airlines, among others) formed the competing company Galileo GDS based on Apollo. Numerous smaller companies such as KIU have also formed, aimed at niche markets not catered for by the four largest networks, including the low-cost carrier segment, and small and medium size domestic and regional airlines.

==Trends==
For many years, global distribution systems (GDSs) have had a dominant position in the travel industry. To bypass the GDSs, and avoid high GDS fees, airlines have started to sell flights directly through their websites. Another way to bypass the GDSs is direct connection to travel agencies, such as that of American Airlines.

<text>St Philip Neri Church Liverpool is home to the Roman Catholic chaplaincy to the universities in Liverpool. It features a Byzantine inspired design by PS Gilby and was built between 1914 and 1920. There are exterior friezes depicting the Last Supper and of Our Lady and the Child Jesus inscribed with the two titles given to Our Lady at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD, i.e. Latin &#x27;Deipara&#x27; and Greek &#x27;Theotokos&#x27; (God-Bearer) over the door onto Catherine Street. There is also a large stone inscribed in Latin set in the wall bearing the name of Thomas (Whiteside), Archbishop of Liverpool 8 Oct 1916 which dates from the time the church was constructed. The parish grew from the school named &#x27;The Institute&#x27; which opened in 1853 in nearby Hope Street. It was visited by the founder of the English Oratorians (Cardinal) John Henry Newman of The Oratory of St Philip Neri in Edgbaston, Birmingham. The parish and later the church were named after Saint Philip Neri in honour of Newman since Philip Neri had founded the original Oratory church in Rome.
Parish registers of the church dating as far back as 1864 can be inspected at the Liverpool Record Office.

In the 1950s, the then priest Fr John Garvin, transformed an adjoining bombsite into a Spanish garden, &#x27;El Jardin de Nuestra Señora&#x27; - the Garden of Our Lady. the church became the chaplaincy for the Universities (The University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University) in September 2001 when the old Liverpool University chaplaincy relocated from its previous home on the cathedral precinct, opposite the University of Liverpool Guild of Students, on Mount Pleasant. The church, which is a Grade II* listed building, recently received a grant of £72,000 to help remedy water ingress damage to its mosaic tiling.
The Church has 6 altars: 
An altar in the main nave.
The original high altar.
An altar with devotion to the most Sacred heart of Jesus. 
An altar with devotion to the Virgin Mary.
A side altar with devotion to Saint Joseph.
The Church also has an altar with a devotion to Saint Gerard at the back of the main Church space.

<text>Kamarkattu / Kamarkat / Kamarcut / Kalkona is a traditional South Indian candy made out of roasted coconut flakes slowly cooked with jaggery syrup. 

It is a nostalgic sweet treat that is famous in South India and fondly remembered by the kids of 70s, 80s and early 90s. As school kids, they would have indulged in this delicacy from the vendors selling them on sidewalks. Easily available in rural towns and villages but is a bit uncommon in major cities. There a few new brands who have introduced this coconut delight in modern packaging and portion suitable for it to be sold from modern outlets and ecommerce sales channels.

<doc id="1155985" wikidata="Q4189720" url="?curid=1155985" title="Tak and the Power of Juju">
<text>Tak and the Power of Juju is a 2003 platform game developed by Avalanche Software and published by THQ for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. The game was released in North America on October 15, 2003 and in Europe on March 12, 2004.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; is a platformer game in which the player controls Tak, who can jump, attack, and interact with animals to overcome obstacles. The player&#x27;s health is represented by the feather on Tak&#x27;s head and, along with mana, can be restored by collecting feathers found throughout the environment. After obtaining the Spirit Rattle, he gains access to &quot;Juju Powers&quot;, which are acquired by collecting tokens scattered around the environment.

==Plot==
According to an ancient prophecy, the Moon Juju, the guardian of the Pupanunu people, will be weakened by the evil Tlaloc, an embittered Pupanunu shaman who seeks to transform the Pupanunu into sheep as revenge for not being made high shamans in favor of another shaman, Jibolba. However, a warrior trained by the high shaman will restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu.

In the present, Tlaloc transforms the Pupanunu into sheep and steals the Moon Stones, which the Moon Juju uses to protect them from evil. Jibolba escapes Tlaloc&#x27;s spell and believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy. However, as he prepares to send him off, he discovers that he has seemingly been transformed into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok, but his squire Tobar. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows its wielder to communicate with Juju spirits, while he finds Lok.

Upon returning with the Rattle, Tak discovers that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect one hundred magic Yorbels and Lok&#x27;s spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to resurrect Lok. However, since Lok suffers from diarrhea as a side effect of the resurrection, Tak obtains the Moon Stones while he recovers, restoring the Moon Juju&#x27;s power. The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak. Using his Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and transforms him into a sheep, fulfilling the prophecy.

==Development==
&quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; was created by John Blackburn, the CEO of Avalanche Software, who first conceived the idea in 1995 before pitching it in 1998. The game was meant to be an organic platformer taking place in a natural world that lacked typical video game conventions. It was also to have complex puzzles and obstacles and not take itself too seriously, at a time when other games held the player&#x27;s hand with obvious puzzles. The game was developed by Avalanche Software for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance under Nickelodeon and published by THQ, which was unprecedented at the time due to it being original and not based on an existing show or film.

The game had a marketing budget of $8.7 million.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot gave both the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions a 6.8 out of 10, writing, &quot;&quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; can serve as a decent platformer, but if you&#x27;re in the market for one, it shouldn&#x27;t be your first choice.&quot;The game sold more than one million units.

During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; was nominated by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences for &quot;Console Children&#x27;s Game of the Year&quot;, but lost to &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;.

==Sequels and spin-offs==

The game spawned two direct sequels, &quot;Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as two spinoffs based on the &quot;Tak&quot; television series, &quot;Tak and the Guardians of Gross&quot; and &quot;Tak: Mojo Mistake&quot;.

==TV series==

&quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot; is an animated television series that debuted on Nickelodeon on August 31, 2007. Directed by Mark Risley and Jim Schumann, it was the first CGI series to be directly produced in-house by Nickelodeon.

<text>Rao Bika (5 August 1438 – 17 June 1504), was a scion of the Rathore clan of Rajputs and the founder of the city of Bikaner and Bikaner State in present-day state of Rajasthan in India. He was the fifth son of Rao Jodha, founder of the city of Jodhpur. During his reign he controlled an area of 40,000 square miles, which included 3,000 villages.

== Establishment of Bikaner ==

In 1465 AD, Rao Bika had come late and taken seat beside his uncle, Rawat Kandhal, with whom he carried a conversation in whisper. Rao Jodha jestingly remarked that they must be making a plan of conquest of new territory, an idea constantly being suggested to him to provide for his large family. Rao Bika and Rawat Kandhal took the observation as a challenge and pledged to win new lands. The land approved by Rao Jodha to conquer through conquest was Jangladesh which had been largely weakened by war as suggested by Napo, a Sankhala Rajput. On 30 September 1465 AD, the 27 year old Rao Bika along with Rawat Kandhal who had sworn to establish his nephew just like he did Rao Jodha in Marwar. With a considerable following of 100 horsemen and 500 foot-soldiers left Jodhpur along with his uncles Kandhal, Rupo, Mandan, Mandalo and Nathu; his brothers Bida, Jogayat; his dhai brother rav chahayad gahlot and others. Jangladesh was then inhabited by the Bhatis, Jats, Bhattis and Johiyas. Bika led an army of around 300 of his clansmen to conquer the Jangladesh area. Bika also had the support of Karni Mata, Charans and Godara Jats. Rao Bika founded Bikaner state and conquered the areas of Sirsa, Ladnu, Bhatner, Bhatinda, Singhana, Rini, Nohar and Pugal. During his reign, he controlled an area of 40,000 square miles, which included 3,000 villages. After Rao Bika&#x27;s death, his elder son Rao Nara became the new ruler of Bikaner, however he died within a year of his reign. Nara was succeeded by his younger brother Rao Lunkaran in 1505.

<doc id="1155992" wikidata="Q6532216" url="?curid=1155992" title="Let's Active">
<text>Let&#x27;s Active was an American rock group formed in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1981, and often identified with the jangle pop guitar work of the group&#x27;s frontman and songwriter Mitch Easter. After disbanding in 1990, the group reformed in August 2014 to play a benefit show in North Carolina.

==History==

=== Formation (1981–1982)===
Let&#x27;s Active was formed in 1981 by Mitch Easter, a guitarist and songwriter best known as a record producer, with Faye Hunter on bass. Drummer Sara Romweber, then 17 years old (a full decade younger than Hunter and Easter), joined to form the original trio two weeks before their first live performance.

The name of the group was taken from a T-shirt sold in Japan bearing an inadvertently nonsensical English phrase (a popular fashion at the time). In a 1984 interview, Hunter said, &quot;It&#x27;s embarrassing for people to ask you what the name of your group is and you don&#x27;t want to say it out loud&quot;, and noted that the band had been erroneously billed by promoters as &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; and &quot;Les Active&quot;.

The group played their first performance on November 13, 1981, at the 688 Club in Atlanta, opening for R.E.M., whose first EP, &quot;Chronic Town&quot; (1982), was produced by Easter. He also co-produced R.E.M.&#x27;s first two albums (1983&#x27;s &quot;Murmur&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Reckoning&quot;) with Don Dixon.

=== &quot;Afoot&quot; and &quot;Cypress&quot; (1983–1984) ===
The band was signed to I.R.S. Records in 1983, shortly after filming the video for &quot;Every Word Means No&quot; as guests on &quot;I.R.S. Records Presents: The Cutting Edge&quot;, the label&#x27;s MTV television program. According to Easter, the cheaply made &quot;econo-video&quot; was based on the band&#x27;s concept of having dogs running through the set, &quot;which would make it chaos. But they couldn&#x27;t get dogs, so instead they got these puppies, which changed the vibe considerably – and changed the worldview of our band for all eternity, because these puppies were just so adorable&quot;.

The original trio of Easter, Hunter and Romweber released the six-song &quot;Afoot&quot; EP on I.R.S. in 1983. Lynn Blakey, later of Tres Chicas, joined to tour with the group in 1983.

The group released the full-length &quot;Cypress&quot; in 1984. Romweber quit the band during a UK tour that year, and Hunter and Easter, a couple, split up shortly afterward. However, the band was kept alive by Easter, who played as Let&#x27;s Active with Hunter and two members of The Windbreakers, Jay Peck (drums) and Tim Lee (keyboards), until a new permanent lineup was established.

=== &quot;Big Plans for Everybody&quot; and &quot;Every Dog Has His Day&quot; (1985–1990) ===
In 1985, Easter brought Angie Carlson, previously a rock journalist, into the band to play guitar and keyboards. After Hunter&#x27;s departure, Carlson also took on a role as vocalist, and would later marry Easter.

The band&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;Big Plans for Everybody&quot; (1986), was largely a solo recording by Easter, who played most of the instruments himself and handled the mixing and production. On board for a few tracks, however, were Carlson, bassist/vocalist Hunter, and drummers Rob Ladd and Eric Marshall. Dennis Ambrose played bass at the beginning of the group&#x27;s 1986 tour, with the lineup of Easter, Carlson and Marshall. Ambrose was later replaced on bass by Janine Cooper Ayres for the fall leg of the 1986 tour opening for R.E.M.

By the time of Let&#x27;s Active&#x27;s third and final album, &quot;Every Dog Has His Day&quot; (1988), the band&#x27;s sound had evolved into harder-edged power pop. The album was produced by John Leckie and Easter, and listed a lineup of Easter, Carlson, Marshall and a new member, bassist Jon Heames (credited as &quot;John Heames&quot;). Despite the credits, though, the album was largely recorded by Easter and Marshall, with significant contributions by Carlson. The subsequent tour featured a cohesive lineup of Easter, Carlson, Marshall and Heames.

The band became inactive after a final performance in early 1990 – around the same time Easter and Carlson broke up.

=== Post-breakup careers (1990–2014) ===
After the dissolution of Let&#x27;s Active, Carlson went on to form the band Grover in 1993, which released a single and one full-length album, &quot;My Wild Life&quot; (1995), with Easter producing some of the tracks.

Easter, meanwhile, concentrated on his production career, and rarely performed or recorded his own music in the decades following Let&#x27;s Active&#x27;s dissolution. He made a few appearances on tribute albums, performing solo renditions of hits by R.E.M. and The Hollies, and joined Velvet Crush as a touring guitarist for a time in the mid-1990s. In 2000, re-teaming with Marshall, Easter formed the trio Shalini with singer-songwriter and bassist Shalini Chatterjee, who was then Easter&#x27;s girlfriend (now former wife). Easter wrote some of Shalini&#x27;s material, but the focus was on Chatterjee, the band&#x27;s lead vocalist and primary writer. The same three musicians also briefly played under the name the Fiendish Minstrels, which featured Easter&#x27;s lead vocals as well as a selection of Let&#x27;s Active tunes in their repertoire. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Easter also resumed recording and performing under his own name. His first—and to date only—official solo album, &quot;Dynamico&quot;, was released in 2007.

Romweber was a founding member of the band Snatches of Pink. In 2007, she joined her brother, Dexter Romweber of the Flat Duo Jets, to record and perform as the Dex Romweber Duo.

Hunter committed suicide on July 21, 2013, in Advance, North Carolina, at the age of 59.

=== Reunion (2014) ===
In August 2014, Easter and Sara Romweber reunited Let&#x27;s Active for a benefit performance for a cancer charity, the Be Loud! Sophie Foundation. Easter invited former Game Theory member Suzi Ziegler to join the group, stepping in to fill Hunter&#x27;s role as bassist. Easter had previously worked with Ziegler when he produced Game Theory&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;The Big Shot Chronicles&quot;. The trio, supported by keyboard player Missy Thangs (of the Love Language) and vocalist Lynn Blakey, performed a set that included &quot;Every Word Means No&quot; and &quot;Edge of the World&quot;.

Sara Romweber died of a brain tumor on March 4, 2019, at the age of 55.

== Legacy and critical response ==
Despite critical praise, Let&#x27;s Active had limited commercial success and initially became known because of Easter&#x27;s production work with R.E.M., the Bongos and Pylon.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the 1984 song &quot;Every Word Means No&quot; was a &quot;quintessential gem&quot; of its period, and the early Let&#x27;s Active was &quot;one of the more intriguing garage pop bands&quot;, with &quot;endless hooks and cleverly skewed lyrics&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming wrote that the group&#x27;s recordings established that Easter &quot;deserves to be acknowledged as one of the finer songwriters of his time and place,&quot; and &quot;by all rights, should have made him the darling of the college radio (and maybe even the pop charts) with their sharp hooks and insightful lyrics&quot;.

Let&#x27;s Active was the subject of a tribute album, &quot;Every Word: A Tribute to Let&#x27;s Active&quot; (2003), which featured 20 cover performances by artists such as Don Dixon, Bill Lloyd, Bobby Sutliff and Tommy Womack.

<text>Sabre Global Distribution System, owned by Sabre Corporation, is a travel reservation system used by travel agents and companies to search, price, book, and ticket travel services provided by airlines, hotels, car rental companies, rail providers and tour 
operators. Originally developed by American Airlines under CEO C.R. Smith with the assistance of IBM in 1960, the booking service became available for use by external travel agents in 1976 and became independent of the airline in March 2000.

==Overview==
The system&#x27;s parent company is organized into three business units:
*Sabre Travel Network: global distribution system
*Sabre Airline Solutions: airline technology
*Sabre Hospitality Solutions: hotel technology solutions

Sabre is headquartered in Southlake, Texas, and has many employees in various locations around the world.

==History==
The name of the travel reservation system is an abbreviation for &quot;Semi-automated Business Research Environment&quot;, and was originally styled in all-capital letters as SABRE. It was developed to automate the way American Airlines booked reservations.

In the 1950s, American Airlines was facing a serious challenge in its ability to quickly handle airline reservations in an era that witnessed high growth in passenger volumes in the airline industry. Before the introduction of SABRE, the airline&#x27;s system for booking flights was entirely manual, having developed from the techniques originally developed at its Little Rock, Arkansas, reservations center in the 1920s. In this manual system, a team of eight operators would sort through a rotating file with cards for every flight. When a seat was booked, the operators would place a mark on the side of the card, and knew visually whether it was full. This part of the process was not all that slow, at least when there were not that many planes, but the entire end-to-end task of looking for a flight, reserving a seat, and then writing up the ticket could take up to three hours in some cases, and 90 minutes on average. The system also had limited room to scale. It was limited to about eight operators because that was the maximum that could fit around the file. To handle more queries the only solution was to add more layers of hierarchy to filter down requests into batches.

American Airlines had already attacked the problem to some degree, and was in the process of introducing their new Magnetronic Reservisor, an electromechanical computer, in 1952 to replace the card files. This computer consisted of a single magnetic drum, each memory location holding the number of seats left on a particular flight. Using this system, a large number of operators could access information simultaneously, so the ticket agents could be told via phone if a seat was available. On the downside, a staff member was needed at each end of the phone line, and handling the ticket took considerable effort and filing. Something much more highly automated was needed if American Airlines was going to enter the jet age, booking many times more seats.

During the testing phase of the Reservisor a high-ranking IBM salesman, Blair Smith, was flying on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles back to IBM in New York City in 1953. He found himself sitting next to American Airlines president C. R. Smith. Noting that they shared a family name, they began talking.

Just prior to this chance meeting, IBM had been working with the United States Air Force on their Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) project. SAGE used a series of large computers to coordinate the message flow from radar sites to interceptors, dramatically reducing the time needed to direct an attack on an incoming bomber. The system used teleprinter machines located around the world to feed information into the system, which then sent orders back to teleprinters located at the fighter bases. It was one of the first online systems.

Smith and Watson observed that the SAGE system&#x27;s basic architecture was suitable for use in American Airlines&#x27; booking services. Teleprinters would be placed at American Airlines&#x27; ticketing offices to send in requests and receive responses directly, without the need for anyone on the other end of the phone. The number of available seats on the aircraft could be tracked automatically, and if a seat was available the ticket agent could be notified. Booking simply took one more command, updating the availability and, if desired, could be followed by printing a ticket.

Thirty days later IBM sent a research proposal to American Airlines, suggesting that they join forces to study the problem. A team was set up consisting of IBM engineers led by John Siegfried and a large number of American Airlines&#x27; staff led by Malcolm Perry, taken from booking, reservations, and ticket sales, calling the effort the &quot;Semi-Automated Business Research Environment&quot;, or SABRE.

A formal development arrangement was signed in 1957. The first experimental system went online in 1960, based on two IBM 7090 mainframes in a new data center located in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The system was a success. Up to this point, it had cost $40 million to develop and install . The SABRE system by IBM in the 1960s was specified to process a very large number of transactions, such as handling 83,000 daily phone calls. The system took over all booking functions in 1964, when the name had changed to SABRE.

In 1972, SABRE was migrated to IBM System/360 systems in a new underground location in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Max Hopper joined American Airlines in 1972 as director of SABRE, and pioneered its use. Originally used only by American Airlines, the system was expanded to access by travel agents in 1976.

With SABRE up and running, IBM offered its expertise to other airlines, and soon developed Deltamatic for Delta Air Lines on the IBM 7074, and PANAMAC for Pan American World Airways using an IBM 7080. In 1968, they generalized their work into the PARS (Programmed Airline Reservation System), which ran on any member of the IBM System/360 family and thus could support any sized airline. The operating system component of PARS evolved into ACP (&quot;Airlines Control Program&quot;), and later to TPF (&quot;Transaction Processing Facility&quot;). Application programs were originally written in assembly language, later in SabreTalk, a proprietary dialect of PL/I, and now in C and C++.

By the 1980s, SABRE offered airline reservations through the CompuServe Information Service, and General Electric&#x27;s GEnie under the Eaasy SABRE brand. This service was extended to America Online (AOL) in the 1990s.

American and Sabre separated on March 15, 2000. Sabre had been a publicly traded corporation, Sabre Holdings, stock symbol TSG on the New York Stock Exchange until taken private in March 2007. The corporation introduced the new logo and changed from the all-caps acronym &quot;SABRE&quot; to the mixed-case &quot;Sabre Holdings&quot;, when the new corporation was formed. The Travelocity website, introduced in 1996, was owned by Sabre Holdings. Travelocity was acquired by Expedia in January 2015. Sabre Holdings&#x27; three remaining business units, Sabre Travel Network, Sabre Airline Solutions and Sabre Hospitality, today serves as a global travel technology company.

==Other airline systems==
In 1982, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; reported that &quot;United Airlines operates a similar system, Apollo, while Eastern operates Mars and Delta operates Datas.&quot; Braniff International&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy&quot; system was considered by Electronic Data Systems for building an airline-neutral system.

==Controversy==
A 1982 study by American Airlines found that travel agents selected the flight appearing on the first line more than half the time. Ninety-two percent of the time, the selected flight was on the first screen. This provided a huge incentive for American to manipulate its ranking formula, or even corrupt the search algorithm outright, to favor American flights over its competitors in the results of flight search results, and the airline did not resist the temptation.

At first this was limited to juggling the relative importance of factors such as the length of the flight, how close the actual departure time was to the desired time, and whether the flight had a connection, but with each success American became bolder. In late 1981, New York Air added a flight from La Guardia to Detroit, challenging American in an important market. Before long, the new flights suddenly started appearing at the bottom of the screen. Its reservations dried up, and it was forced to cut back from eight Detroit flights a day to none.

On one occasion, Sabre deliberately withheld Continental&#x27;s discount fares on 49 routes where American competed. A Sabre staffer had been directed to work on a program that would automatically suppress any discount fares loaded into the system.

Congress investigated these practices, and in 1983 Bob Crandall, president of American, vocally defended the airline&#x27;s preferential treatment of its own offerings in the system. &quot;The preferential display of our flights, and the corresponding increase in our market share, is the competitive &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; for having created the system in the first place,&quot; he told them. The U.S. government disagreed, and in 1984 it outlawed the biasing practices for the search results.

The fairness rules were eliminated or allowed to expire in 2010. By then, none of the major distribution systems was majority owned by the airlines.

In 1987 Sabre&#x27;s success of selling to European travel agents was inhibited by the refusal of big European carriers led by British Airways to grant the system ticketing authority for their flights even though Sabre had obtained IATA Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) clearance for the UK in 1986. American brought High Court action which alleged that after the arrival of Sabre on its doorstep British Airways immediately offered financial incentives to travel agents who continued to use Travicom and would tie any override commissions to it. Travicom was created by Videcom, British Airways and British Caledonian and launched in 1976 as the world&#x27;s first multi-access reservations system based on Videcom technology which eventually became part of Galileo UK. It connected 49 subscribing international airlines (including British Airways, British Caledonian, TWA, Pan American World Airways, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, SAS, Air Canada, KLM, Alitalia, Cathay Pacific and JAL) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987.

British Airways eventually bought out the stakes in Travicom held by Videcom and British Caledonian, to become the sole owner. Although Sabre&#x27;s vice-president in London, David Schwarte, made representations to the U.S. Department of Transportation and the British Monopolies Commission, British Airways defended the use of Travicom as a truly non-discriminatory system in flight selection because an agent had access to some 50 carriers worldwide, including Sabre, for flight information.

<text>A sabaton or solleret is part of a knight&#x27;s body armor that covers the foot.

==History==
14th and 15th-century sabatons typically end in a tapered point well past the actual toes of the wearer&#x27;s foot, following fashionable shoe shapes of the era. Sabatons of the late 15th and early 16th century followed the duckbill shoes of the time, ending at the tip of the toe but often extending greatly wider. The sabatons were the first piece of armour to be put on, and were made of riveted iron plates called &quot;lames&quot;. These plates generally covered only the top of the foot. Some sources maintain that the broad-toed variant is the true sabaton, whereas the earlier versions should be referred to as a solleret.

At least in theory, French princes and dukes were allowed to have toes of Gothic sabatons times, lords (barons and higher) 2 times, and gentry only one time the length of their feet. If we assume as the standard length, these would be , , and , respectively.

The sabaton was not commonly used by knights or men at arms fighting on foot. Instead, many would simply wear leather shoes or boots. Heavy or pointy metal footwear would severely hinder movement and mobility on the ground, particularly under wet or muddy conditions. Attacks against the feet are not common in dismounted combat, as a strike to an enemy&#x27;s foot would typically put the attacker in a very awkward and vulnerable position. Conversely, a mounted knight&#x27;s feet would be at perfect height for strikes from dismounted soldiers, and so sabatons or other foot armour would be vital when riding into battle. An earlier solution was for the mail of the chausses to completely cover the foot, but later the mail terminated at the ankle, either overlapping the outside of the sabaton or extending beneath it.

The effigy of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, shows how 15th century Italian-style sabatons would have been worn. These consist of a toe cap, four articulated lames, a foot plate and ankle plate, and a hinged heel cap, joined with buckled straps. Although the spurs are missing from the effigy, remains of rivet holes and staples may represent the way that the spurs would have been directly attached to the heel cap of the sabaton, rather than being strapped on afterwards.

==Other uses==
&quot;Sabaton&quot; is also the name of a type of broad-toed Flemish shoe, popular in the Late Middle Ages.

Sabaton is the name of a Swedish heavy metal band who write songs based on military history.

<doc id="1155996" wikidata="Q7755268" url="?curid=1155996" title="The Oratory, Liverpool">
<text>The Oratory stands to the north of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral in Merseyside, England. It was originally the mortuary chapel to St James Cemetery, and houses a collection of 19th-century sculpture and important funeral monuments as part of the Walker Art Gallery. It is a Grade I listed building in the National Heritage List for England.

==History==
The Oratory was built in 1829, and used for funeral services before burials in the adjacent cemetery. It was designed by John Foster. When the cemetery closed, the building fell into disuse. In 1986 it came under the care of National Museums Liverpool, and is used to contain a collection of sculptures and statues.

==Architecture==
The building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple. At each end is a portico with six columns. There are no windows and the building is lit from above. Inside, a coffered ceiling is supported by Ionic columns. Pollard and Pevsner consider this to be Foster&#x27;s best surviving building. On 28 June 1952 it was designated as a Grade I listed building. In the National Heritage List for England it is described as &quot;one of the purest monuments of the Greek Revival in England&quot;. Around the Oratory are cast iron railings and gate piers that have been listed at Grade II.

==Collection==
Inside the building is a collection of monuments, mainly Neoclassical reliefs, many of which were brought here from demolished buildings in the 1980s. These include a monument dated 1834 given to the Nicholson family by Francis Chantrey, one to William Earle, who died in 1839, by John Gibson, to Dr William Stevenson, who died in 1853, by J. A. P. Macbride, to William Hammerton, who died in 1832, by Gibson, to William Ewart, who died in 1823, by Joseph Gott, to Emily Robinson, who died in 1829, by Gibson, and to Agnes Jones, who died in 1868, by Pietro Tenerani. There is also a statue of William Huskisson by Gibson that was formerly in the Custom House.

<doc id="1155998" wikidata="Q4376955" url="?curid=1155998" title="Sabre Corporation">
<text>Sabre Corporation, a travel technology company headquartered in Southlake, Texas, is the largest global distribution systems (GDS) provider for air bookings. The company&#x27;s primary product, the Sabre Global Distribution System, and others like it, act as neutral intermediaries, connecting travel suppliers like airlines and hotels with travel sellers like agencies. They offer real-time availability and pricing, making them important for corporate travel management.

Founded by American Airlines in 1960, Sabre was spun off and became an independent company in 2000. In 2007, Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners acquired Sabre Holdings, the company&#x27;s former name. Sabre then went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2014.

Sabre&#x27;s primary competitors are Amadeus IT Group, which operates the Amadeus CRS and Travelport, which operates the Galileo GDS.

==History==

===Early history===
In 1953, C.R. Smith, the president of American Airlines, met Blair Smith, an IBM salesman, on a flight and developed the Sabre (the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment) concept. The system was based on SAGE, the first major system to use interactive real-time computing, which IBM had developed for military use.

Sabre Corporation was founded in 1960 by American Airlines. Sabre Corporation installed the first Sabre reservation system in Briarcliff Manor, New York that year. The system consisted of two IBM 7090 mainframe computers and processed 84,000 calls per day.

In 1964, Sabre&#x27;s nationwide network was completed and became the largest commercial real-time data-processing system in the world. Sabre Corporation handled 7500 passenger reservations per hour in 1965. The Sabre system upgraded to IBM System/360 and moved to a new center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972.

In 1976, the Sabre system was installed into a travel agency for the first time. This allowed travel agents to have instant access to flights. By the end of the year, 130 locations installed the Sabre system. Sabre introduced BargainFinder, the industry&#x27;s first automated low-fare search capability, in 1984. The following year, eAAsySabre was launched. It gave consumers with personal computers access to the Sabre system to make airline, hotel and car rental reservations.

In 1989 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Sabre having &quot;about 38 percent of the reservations market.&quot;

In 1996, the company launched Travelocity, an online travel agency. Sabre formed a joint venture with Abacus International in 1998 to create SabreSonic, a customized version of Sabre&#x27;s reservations system to Abacus subscribers in Asia.

===2000s===
AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, spun off its controlling stake in Sabre Corporation in 2000 to form an independent company.

In 2001, Electronic Data Systems (EDS) purchased Sabre Holdings&#x27; airline hardware and communications business, and Sabre began migrating its old mainframe for air travel shopping and pricing to HP NonStop and Linux servers. In 2005, the company acquired lastminute.com, an online travel and leisure retailer.

Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners acquired Sabre Corporation in March 2007. In March 2010, the company acquired Calidris, a revenue integrity and business intelligence company. Sabre Corporation acquired SoftHotel, a web-based property management provider, in June 2011. The company launched Sabre Red App Centre in March 2012. In April 2014, Sabre Corporation went public on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol SABR. The IPO sold for $16 per share and valued Sabre at $3.93 billion. The company acquired Genares, a hospitality technology company, that September.

In December 2014, Bravofly Rumbo Group acquired Sabre European Online Travel Agency, lastminute.com.

In January 2015, Sabre sold its Travelocity brand to Expedia, Inc. for $280 million. In July 2015, Sabre acquired Abacus International, a global distribution system based in the Asia-Pacific region. The deal included long-term distribution agreements between Sabre and the 11 Asian airlines that previously shared ownership of Abacus.

In June 2016, Sabre announced Tom Klein would resign as CEO by the end of 2016.

In October 2019 Sabre announced its purchase of Radixx for $110M. Radixx is a seller of passenger service software to small and budget airlines. Sabre expects Radixx to generate $20 million in 2019.

In October 2021, Sabre announced the sale of the AirCentre portfolio to CAE Inc for $392.5M.

In May 2022 Sabre announced its purchase of Nuvola, a provider of hotel and service optimization software.

In August 2022, Sabre acquired Conferma Pay, a UK-based payments company.

In March 2023, Sabre announced some executive changes as part of what it called its &quot;long-term succession plan.&quot; The changes include Sean Menke transitioning to be solely Executive Chair effective April 27. At the same time, Kurt Ekert, who served as the president of Sabre, will take over as CEO.

==Operations==
The company is based in Southlake, Texas and has additional offices in London, Kraków, Bangalore, Montevideo and Singapore. In December 2013, the company handled approximately 85,000 data transactions every second for customers according to the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;. At the time, the company did business with 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels. Sabre has two major business verticals - Sabre Travel Solutions and Sabre Hospitality Solutions.

<doc id="1155999" wikidata="Q48875" url="?curid=1155999" title="Pesniary">
<text>Pesniary (also spelled Pesnyary, , ) was a popular Soviet Belarusian folk rock VIA. It was founded in 1969 by guitarist Vladimir Mulyavin. Before 1970, the band was known under the name Liavony (Лявоны).

==Style==
Pesniary combined various types of music, but mostly Belarusian folklore though often with various rock elements and later rock as well. Several of Pesniary&#x27;s songs were composed by Aleksandra Pakhmutova. The surprising influence of early Frank Zappa was also notable.

==Biography==
In 1973, the band participated in Soviet television film &quot;This Merry Planet&quot;.

Pesniary was one of the very few Soviet bands (and possibly the first one) to tour in America in 1976. They toured the American South with folk band The New Christy Minstrels. 

After Mulyavin&#x27;s death in a car accident on 26 January 2003, the original Pesniary split. Five different bands claimed to be the official descendants of Pesniary, touring and performing original Pesniary songs. These are:

* Belarusian State Ensemble Pesniary – a state-produced band under the Ministry of Culture of Belarus, consisting mostly of young musicians.
* Belorusskie Pesniari – led by former Pesniary saxophonist Uladzislau Misevich.
* Pesniari – led by former Pesniary vocalist Leanid Bortkevich.
* Liavony – a band which split from Bortkevich’s Pesniari in 2008, consisted of young musicians, none of whom participated in Pesniary until 1998.
* Until 2006, the Liavony-Pesniary ensemble existed under the direction of the classical line-up drummer Alexander Demeshko. The band broke up in 2006 after his death.

==Discography==
The band also released dozens of singles.

==Lineup==
The lineup of the band changed frequently. Among the most notable and long-lived band members were:

*Lyudmila Isupova (vocals, flute,1975–1979)
*Vladimir Mulyavin (guitar, vocals,1968–2003)

<doc id="1156007" wikidata="Q1052771" url="?curid=1156007" title="Celali rebellions">
<text>The Celali rebellions () were a series of rebellions in Anatolia of irregular troops led by bandit chiefs and provincial officials known as &quot;celalî&quot;, &quot;celâli&quot;, or &quot;jelālī&quot;, against the authority of the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th and early to mid-17th centuries. The first revolt termed as such occurred in 1519, during Sultan Selim I&#x27;s reign, near Tokat under the leadership of Celâl, an Alevi preacher. Celâl&#x27;s name was later used by Ottoman histories as a general term for rebellious groups in Anatolia, most of whom bore no particular connection to the original Celâl. As it is used by historians, the &quot;Celali rebellions&quot; refer primarily to the activity of bandits and warlords in Anatolia from c. 1590 to 1610, with a second wave of Celali activity, this time led by rebellious provincial governors rather than bandit chiefs, lasting from 1622 to the suppression of the revolt of Abaza Hasan Pasha in 1659. These rebellions were the largest and longest lasting in the history of the Ottoman Empire.

The major uprisings involved the &quot;sekbans&quot; (irregular troops of musketeers) and &quot;sipahis&quot; (cavalrymen maintained by land grants). The rebellions were not attempts to overthrow the Ottoman government but were reactions to a social and economic crisis stemming from a number of factors: demographic pressure following a period of unprecedented population growth during the 16th century, climatic hardship associated with the Little Ice Age, a depreciation of the currency, and the mobilization of thousands of &quot;sekban&quot; musketeers for the Ottoman army during its wars with the Habsburgs and Safavids, who turned to banditry when demobilized. Celali leaders often sought no more than to be appointed to provincial governorships within the empire, while others fought for specific political causes, such as Abaza Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s effort to topple the Janissary government established after the regicide of Osman II in 1622, or Abaza Hasan Pasha&#x27;s desire to overthrow the grand vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha. The Ottoman leaders understood why the Celali rebels were making demands, so they gave some of the Celali leaders government jobs to stop the rebellion and make them part of the system. The Ottoman army used force to defeat those who didn&#x27;t get jobs and kept fighting. The Celali rebellions ended when the most powerful leaders became part of the Ottoman system and the weaker ones were defeated by the Ottoman army. The janissaries and former rebels who had joined the Ottomans fought to keep their new government jobs.

==Major revolts==
===Karayazıcı (1598)===

In 1598 a sekban leader, Karayazıcı Abdülhalim, united the dissatisfied groups in the Anatolia Eyalet and established a base of power in Sivas and Dulkadir, where he was able to force towns to pay tribute to him. He was offered the governorship of Çorum, but refused the post and when Ottoman forces were sent against them, he retreated with his forces to Urfa, seeking refuge in a fortified castle, which became the center of resistance for 18 months. Out of fear that his forces would mutiny against him, he left the castle, was defeated by government forces, and died some time later in 1602 from natural causes. His brother Deli Hasan then seized Kutahya, in western Anatolia, but later he and his followers were won over by grants of governorships.

<doc id="1156008" wikidata="Q331107" url="?curid=1156008" title="Stevens Thomson Mason (senator)">
<text>Colonel Stevens Thomson Mason (December 29, 1760May 10, 1803) was an American lawyer, military officer and planter who served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Mason was also a delegate in the Virginia General Assembly and a Republican U.S. Senator from 1794 to 1803.

==Early and family life==
Mason was born to Thomson Mason (1733–1785); and his wife at Chopawamsic in Stafford County, Virginia. His ancestors had emigrated generations earlier and owned thousands of acres of land (some developed and farmed by enslaved labor) in Maryland and Virginia. His maternal great grandfather was an attorney and significant landowner in Maryland, and (his grandmother) Ann Eilbeck Mason was his only heir, and determined to provide for her younger sons (including Thomson Mason) by securing land and slaves. His uncle George Mason IV had inherited the Mason family estates by primogeniture in 1735 (though then underage, he took control upon reaching legal majority). His grandmother invested in real estate being developed along the Potomac River in Loudoun County, which by the time of her death may have exceeded the lands his uncle inherited by primogeniture. After education by private tutors as a boy, he and his brothers also had access to the library of his lawyer uncle John Mercer near Fredericksburg. Stevens T. Mason then traveled to Williamsburg, Virginia for higher education at the College of William &amp; Mary, concentrating in legal studies.

==Officer, lawyer and planter==
Admitted to the Virginia bar, Mason began a private legal practice in Dumfries, Virginia in Prince William County. His uncle George Mason was one of his clients until his death in 1792. Especially after his father&#x27;s 1785 death at the family&#x27;s Raspberry Plain plantation in what had become Loudoun County, Mason operated farms using enslaved labor, as would his descendants. In the 1787 Virginia tax census, Stevens T. Mason owned 33 slaves over 16 years of age, as well as 38 slaves under age 18, 28 horses, 76 cattle, 4 wheeled vehicles and a stud horse.

During the American Revolutionary War, as his uncle George served in the Virginia General Assembly and drafted the Virginia Declaration of Rights as well as the first Virginia constitution and state seal, Stevens Mason served as an officer in the Continental Army and in the Virginia militia. By the Battle of Yorktown, he was a brigadier general in the Virginia militia as well as an aide to General George Washington.

==Political career==
Following the war, Loudoun County voters elected him as one of their (part-time) representatives in the Virginia State House of Delegates in 1783, and he served alongside veteran John Carter, although neither won re-election the following year. In 1787 he won election to the Virginia State Senate representing Loudoun and nearby Fauquier Counties (thus serving in 4 General Assembly sessions), but failed to win re-election in 1791, being replaced by veteran politician Francis Peyton. Meanwhile Stevens Thomson Mason also won election (alongside Levin Powell) as Loudoun County&#x27;s delegate to the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788, during which his uncle (one of Stafford County&#x27;s representatives) unsuccessfully fought against ratification, but ultimately caused Virginia&#x27;s congressional delegates to propose the Bill of Rights modeled on his Virginia Declaration of Rights and which was later approved by Congress and the states as a series of ten Constitutional amendments. Less than two years following his uncle&#x27;s death, in 1794, Loudoun County voters returned Stevens Thomson Mason to the Virginia House of Delegates. Fellow legislators elected him to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Monroe. Stevens Thomson Mason won re-election in 1797 and again in 1803, and thus served from 18 November 1794, until his death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

While in the Senate Mason handed a copy of the secret Jay Treaty to Pierre Adét, French minister to the United States. The senator along with Senator Pierce Butler leaked the document to the American press. Since his country was at war with Great Britain and hated the idea of a treaty of “amity” between it and the United States, Adét gave the document to Benjamin Bache, publisher of The Aurora — a newspaper — with the hope of raising just the sort of public outcry that ensued—and even, perhaps, of blocking ratification of the treaty.

Mason was the only senator to vote against the confirmation of Oliver Ellsworth as the chief justice of the Supreme Court.

==Death and legacy==
He is interred in the family burying ground at Raspberry Plain in Loudoun County, Virginia.

==Marriage and children==
Mason married Mary Elizabeth Armistead on May 1, 1783. The couple had six children:

*John Thomson Mason (January 8, 1787 – April 17, 1850)
*Armistead Thomson Mason (1787 – February 6, 1819)
*Stevens Thomson Mason (1789 – 17 November 1815)
*Mary Thomson Mason (1791–1813)
*Emily Rutger Mason (1793–1837)
*Catherine Mason (born 1795)

==Relations==
Brother of John Thomson Mason (1765–1824); half-brother of William Temple Thomson Mason (1782–1862); first cousin of George Mason V (1753–1796); first cousin once removed of Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), George Mason VI (1786–1834), Richard Barnes Mason (1797–1850), and James Murray Mason (1798–1871); father of Armistead Thomson Mason (1787–1819) and John Thomson Mason (1787–1850); uncle of John Thomson Mason Jr. (1815–1873); and grandfather of Stevens Thomson Mason (1811–1843), first governor of Michigan. His great granddaughter Kate Mason Rowland would be one of the founding members of the Daughters of the Confederacy and also write a two-volume biography of George Mason IV.

<text>Stevens Thomson Mason (October 27, 1811 – January 4, 1843) was an American politician who served as the first governor of Michigan from 1835 to 1840. Coming to political prominence at an early age, Mason was appointed his territory&#x27;s acting territorial secretary by Andrew Jackson at age 19, becoming the acting territorial governor soon thereafter in 1834 at age 22. As territorial governor, Mason was instrumental in guiding Michigan to statehood, which was secured in 1837. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected as Michigan&#x27;s first state governor in 1835, where he served until 1840. Elected at 23 and taking office at 24, Mason was and remains the youngest state governor in American history.

==Early life in Virginia and Kentucky==
Mason was born near Leesburg in Loudoun County, Virginia, into a politically powerful family. His great-grandfather, Thomson Mason (1733–1785), was chief justice of the Virginia Supreme Court and younger brother of George Mason (1725–1792), who took part in the Constitutional Convention. His grandfather, Stevens Thomson Mason (1760–1803), was a U.S. Senator from Virginia from 1794 until his death. His uncle, Armistead Thomson Mason (1787–1819), was also a U.S. Senator from Virginia. In addition, his uncles by marriage, Benjamin Howard (1760–1814) and William Taylor Barry (1784–1835), both served in the Kentucky House of Representatives and were U.S. Representatives from Kentucky. Howard was also Governor of the Louisiana (Missouri) Territory (1810–1812) and the Missouri Territory (1812–1813). Barry served as a U.S. Senator from Kentucky (1814–1816), then had a long career in a number of Kentucky government positions, and ultimately became U.S. Postmaster General (1829–1835).

In 1812, Mason&#x27;s father, John Thomson Mason (1787–1850), left the Mason family stronghold in Virginia to attempt to make his own fortune in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1817, President James Monroe appointed the elder Mason United States marshal. While his business ventures were a complete failure and the family became nearly broke in the 1820s, he was a lawyer and land agent from an influential family, and went on to become an important figure in the Texas Revolution.

==Life and politics in Michigan Territory==
John Mason was appointed secretary of the Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs in 1830 by President Andrew Jackson. Young Stevens was more politically savvy than his father and helped to protect him from schemes launched by anti-Jackson forces. This gained him notice from the territorial governor, Lewis Cass. In 1831, President Jackson sent the elder Mason on a mission to Mexico and named Stevens to replace his father as secretary, at the age of 19 before he could even vote. At about the same time, Governor Cass became Jackson&#x27;s Secretary of War. As the territorial secretary traditionally served as acting governor, young Mason held that role until George Bryan Porter, who was named to replace Cass in August 1831, arrived in Detroit in 1832. As it turned out, Porter was frequently absent and Mason was, for all practical purposes, the acting governor during this time, leading to his nickname of the &quot;Boy Governor&quot;. Porter died of cholera in Detroit in 1834, and so Mason was once again acting governor of the Michigan Territory.

Mason was influential in petitioning for Michigan statehood. When the first petition in 1832 was not acted upon by the U.S. Congress, Mason commissioned a territorial census. When the census was completed in 1834, it determined that 85,856 people lived in the lower peninsula, more than the 60,000 required for statehood by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. A dispute over a strip of land, the Toledo Strip, claimed by both Michigan and Ohio led to the Toledo War. President Jackson appointed Benjamin Chew Howard of Baltimore and Richard Rush of Philadelphia to arbitrate the dispute, but Mason was not satisfied with the proposal and refused to back down. Not wanting to alienate his political support in Ohio, President Jackson removed Mason as territorial secretary in August 1835 and appointed John S. (&quot;Little Jack&quot;) Horner as his replacement.

==First governor of the state of Michigan==
Although replaced by Horner, Mason was still popular in Michigan. Voters approved a constitution on October 5, 1835, and they elected Mason as governor. However, the U.S. Congress refused to recognize Michigan as a state until the dispute with Ohio was resolved.

In 1836, facing financial difficulties because Michigan was not recognized as a state, Mason agreed to a compromise reached by the U.S. Congress and agreed to cede the disputed land to Ohio in exchange for the western two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula; Michigan already included the eastern third. A convention in September 1836 refused to go along with Mason, but Mason finally prevailed in a second convention in December 1836. On January 26, 1837, Michigan was admitted to the Union.

In 1835, Mason had initiated an ambitious internal improvements program, which included development of three railroads and two canals (one of which was the Clinton-Kalamazoo Canal). Mason was re-elected in 1837, but the state&#x27;s economy soon began to suffer from the effects of the Panic of 1837. Earlier in 1837, Mason had negotiated to fund the internal improvements program through the sale of $5,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds. This arrangement fell apart in 1837 and following bankruptcies by both the company building the canal and the bank backing the loans, the state was left with over $2,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in bad debt. During his business trips to New York to finance his internal improvements program, Mason became acquainted with Julia Phelps and the two married on November 1, 1838.

In early 1838, Mason led the state militia in helping to thwart the Patriot War, an attempt by irregulars to invade and annex parts of Canada. The schooner &quot;Ann&quot; was seized by the Patriots on January 8 and sailed down to Gibraltar, Michigan. Mason, along with a detachment of 200 militiamen, pursued them in two steamships. A hundred Canadian militia also followed in the steamer &quot;Alliance&quot;. Mason met with the Patriot leaders at Gibraltar, but the captured steamship &quot;Ann&quot; continued on toward Fort Malden on the Canadian shore. On January 9, the Patriots began shelling Fort Malden and the town of Amherstburg from the &quot;Ann&quot;. The Canadian militia took up positions in the town while the Patriots moved 300 men onto the Canadian Bois Blanc Island opposite the town. The Canadian militia opened fire on the schooner when it tried to reach the island. The Canadians shot several of the ship&#x27;s crew and damaged the sails and rigging. The ship drifted until it ran aground, at which point the Canadian militia boarded it, encountered no resistance, and captured the crew. The remaining Patriot forces quit Bois Blanc for the safety of the American side of the river. Several of the Patriots were wounded, a few killed, and the Canadians captured 300 muskets, 2 cannon, 10 kegs of gunpowder and various accoutrements. The actions of the so-called &quot;Patriots&quot; were charged in the U.S. as a violation of the Neutrality Act.

Rather than risking a contentious campaign and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat in the elections of 1839, Mason instead decided to give up politics and attempt a private law practice. His successor as governor, an old political rival, William Woodbridge, was determined to place the blame for Michigan&#x27;s financial mess on Mason, and charged Mason with corruption related to the $5,000,000 loan. Mason attempted to defend himself, but his reputation was ruined.

==Retirement and death in New York==

In 1841, Mason left Michigan for New York City, where his wealthy father-in-law, Thaddeus Phelps, lived. Mason tried to establish a law practice there, but struggled to build a clientele. He caught pneumonia in the winter of 1842 and died at the age of 31 during the night of January 4, 1843, though his date of death is sometimes listed as January 5.

Mason was initially interred at New York Marble Cemetery, but on June 4, 1905, his remains were brought from New York to Detroit, accompanied by his sister Emily Mason, then age 92; his daughter, Dorothy Mason Wright; three grandsons; and several grand-nephews and great-grandchildren. Services were conducted by Rev. David M. Cooper, who had known Mason as governor, 70 years earlier. Other notable attendees included then-Governor Fred M. Warner, and the mayor of Detroit, George P. Codd. His remains were interred at Capitol Park, the site of the old Michigan Capitol. Later, a bronze statue of Mason on a granite pedestal was erected over the grave. The statue was created by sculptor Albert Weinert and depicted the young Mason in a confident pose.

On September 3, 2009, officials announced that the park would be reconfigured and the monument moved several yards. But when the crews began to excavate the site, they discovered no grave. After four days of searching, the vault containing the remains was located on June 29, 2010, a few yards south of its original site. It was believed the grave was moved from its 1905 location in 1955 to make room for a bus terminal.

On the 199th anniversary of his birth, October 27, 2010, Mason was reburied for the fourth time in a newly built vault in the pedestal beneath the bronze statue designed by Albert Weinert. Mason&#x27;s great-great-great grandnephew, who resides in Grosse Ile, Michigan, witnessed the reinterment. The current Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, where funeral services were held for Mason in 1843, officiated at the ceremony. Prior to the reinterment, Mason&#x27;s remains were transported to Lansing where they lay in state in the Capitol Building. Mason was only the third Michigan governor to lie in state in the Capitol.

Among his other accomplishments, Mason created an educational system and relocated the University of Michigan to Ann Arbor.

==Marriage and children==
Mason married Julia Elizabeth Phelps in New York City on November 1, 1838. The couple had three children:

*Stevens Thomson Mason Jr. (August 1, 1839 – January 27, 1843)
*Dorothea Eliza Mason Wright (October 29, 1840 – October 4, 1916) Known as Dora, she was the daughter-in-law of Senator William Wright and wife of Colonel Edward H. Wright (1824–1913), a career officer in the United States Army. Dora and Edward Wright were the parents of William M. Wright, a U.S. Army officer who attained the rank of lieutenant general.
*Thaddeus Phelps Mason (March 11, 1842–April 1847)

<text>Dehradun (, ISO: &quot;Dēharādūna&quot;), also known as Dehra Doon, is the winter capital and the most populous city of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and is governed by the Dehradun Municipal Corporation, with the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly holding its winter sessions in the city as its winter capital. Part of the Garhwal region, and housing the headquarters of its Divisional Commissioner, Dehradun is one of the &quot;Counter Magnets&quot; of the National Capital Region (NCR) being developed as an alternative centre of growth to help ease the migration and population explosion in the Delhi metropolitan area and to establish a smart city in the Himalayas.

Dehradun is located in the Doon Valley on the foothills of the Himalayas nestled between Song River, a tributary of Ganges on the east and the Asan River, a tributary of Yamuna on the west. The city is noted for its picturesque landscape and provides a gateway to the surrounding region.

Dehradun is a notable academic and research hub and is home to the Indian Military Academy, Forest Research Institute, Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, the Doon School, Welham Boys School, Welham Girls School, Brightlands School, Rashtriya Indian Military College, Uttarakhand Ayurveda University, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. It is the headquarters of the Surveyor-General of India. According to the combined survey based on health, infrastructure, economy, education, and crime, conducted by Dainik Jagran and KPMG, Dehradun is one of India&#x27;s safest cities. Dehradun is also known for its Basmati rice and bakery products.

Also known as the &quot;Abode of Drona&quot;, Dehradun has been an important centre for Garhwal rulers, which was first captured by Gorkha Kings, in January 1804, and then by the British. For its strategic value, in addition to the location of its principal service academy, the Indian Armed Forces maintain a considerable presence in Dehradun, at the Garhi Cantonment and Naval Station. The Uttarakhand Police is the primary law enforcement agency in the city.

It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as Shimla, Mussoorie, Dhanaulti, Chakrata, New Tehri, Uttarkashi, Harsil, Chopta-Tungnath, Auli, and summer and winter hiking destinations like the Valley of Flowers at Dodital, Dayara Bugyal, Kedarkantha, Har Ki Dun and Hemkunt Sahib for camping and Himalayan panoramic views. The Hindu holy cities of Haridwar and Rishikesh, along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of Chota Char Dham, viz. Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, are also primarily accessed via Dehradun, the closest major city.

==Etymology==
Dehradun is made up of two words &quot;dehra&quot; + &quot;dun.&quot; &quot;dehra&quot; is a Hindi word with the meaning of temple, whose etymology is: &quot;dev&quot; + &quot;ghar&quot;, from Prakrit &quot;devahara.&quot; &quot;dūn&quot; (or Hindi दून derives from the Sanskrit droṇī (or द्रोणि) and means &quot;a tract of country lying at the foot of hills; a valley&quot;

The town was established when Baba Ram Rai, the son of the seventh Sikh Guru, Guru Har Rai built a &quot;gurudwara&quot; or temple in the area in the 17th century. Ram Rai was sent by his father as an emissary to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi. Aurangzeb objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (&quot;Asa ki Var&quot;) that stated, &quot;the clay from a Musalman(Muslim)&#x27;s grave is kneaded into potter&#x27;s lump&quot;, considering it an insult to Islam. Baba Ram Rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting &quot;Musalman&quot; with &quot;Beiman&quot; (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved. This led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence, and name his younger son as his successor. Aurangzeb responded by granting Baba Ram Rai a jagir (land grant) in Garhwal region (Uttarakhand). The town later came to be known as Dehradun, after &quot;Dehra&quot; referring to Baba Ram Rai&#x27;s shrine. Many followers of Ram Rai, called Ramraiyas, settled with Ram Rai. During the days of British Raj, the official name of the town was Dehra. In due time the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun.

In the Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, in ancient India during the Mahabharata epic era, Dronacharya, the great teacher of Kauravas and Pandavas, lived here, hence the name of &quot;Dronanagari&quot; (lit. &quot;city of Drona&quot;).

== History ==
The history of the city of Uttarakhand, Dehradun (nicknamed &quot;Doon Valley&quot;) is linked to the story of Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is believed that after the battle between Ravana and Rama, Rama and his brother Lakshmana visited this site. Also, known as &#x27;Dronanagari&#x27; on the name of Dronacharya, legendary Royal guru to the Kauravas and Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun. Evidence such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region&#x27;s links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had an influence on this region as the rulers of Hastinapura with the descendants of Subahu ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, Rishikesh is mentioned in the pages of history when Vishnu answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called Chakrata has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.

In the seventh century, this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller Huen Tsang. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as Kalsi. Edicts of Ashoka have been found in the region along the banks of the river Yamuna in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region&#x27;s prosperity. It was under control of Garhwal for many centuries. 

Fateh Shah, a Garhwal king, donated three villages in Dehradun to Sikh guru Ram Rai. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gurudwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard&#x27;s map names the place as &quot;Dehra or Gurudwara&quot;. Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.

Dehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Baba Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his &quot;Dera&quot; (camp) in &quot;dun&quot; (valley) in 1676. This &#x27;Dera Dun&#x27; later on became Dehradun.

The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, Fateh Shah to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially, a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building, Guru Ram Rai Darbar Sahib, was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of Kangra-Guler art and Mughal art. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.
Dehradun was invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni during his campaigns into India followed by Timur in 1368, Rohilla chief Najib ad-Dawlah in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1804 battles of Khurbura at Dehradun fought between Garhwal king Pradyuman shah and Gorakhali forces led by General Amar Singh thapa.in which king Pradyuman shah died then this area came under control of Gorakha. In 1806 the Nepalese warlord &quot;Kaji&quot; Amar Singh Thapa under the central leadership of Prime Minister Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as Almora, Pathankot, Kumaon, Garhwal, Sirmur, Shimla, Kangra and Dehradun.

On the western front Garhwal and parts of Himachal Pradesh up to Punjab and on the eastern front the state of Sikkim up to Darjeeling became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British East India Company went to war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugowli where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised Landour and Mussoorie in 1827–1828.
Jawaharlal Nehru, India&#x27;s first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited. He spent his last few days here before passing away in Delhi in 1964. Another leader from the independence movement, Rash Behari Bose, who was one of the key organisers of the Ghadar conspiracy and, later, the Indian National Army was based in Dehradun in his early days before he was forced to move to Japan in 1915 to continue the freedom struggle.

Post-independence Dehradun and other parts of Garhwal and Kumaon were merged with United Provinces which was later renamed the state of Uttar Pradesh. In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital.

===Afghan connection===
Dehradun&#x27;s Afghan connection dated back to the First Anglo-Afghan War, after which the Afghan Emir Dost Mohammad Khan was exiled by the British to Dehradun. He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years. The Balahissar ward under the Mussoorie municipality has been named after the palace of Dost Mohammad. The famous Dehradooni Basmati was brought along by him from Kunar Province in Afghanistan and it continues to be counted as a delicacy of the valley. According to Dehradun historian and heritage activist Lokesh Ohri, &quot;Dost Mohammad Khan was fond of pulao and missed it during his exile. He brought Basmati to the Doon valley and is credited with improving its genetic variety. His grandson Yaqub Khan gave Basmati seeds to a Paltan Bazaar trader and asked him to cultivate them in Dehradun. Surprisingly, the Doon valley&#x27;s weather suited the rice and it turned out even better than the variety in Afghanistan.&quot;

Forty years later, after the Second Anglo-Afghan War, his grandson, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, was sent to exile to India in 1879. Just like his grandfather, he chose Doon valley as his abode. Yakoob became the first Afghan to formally settle in Dehradun. The present Mangla Devi Inter College was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life. The extended family and servants of the King were also relocated to Dehradun.

The Afghan royal family maintained a presence in Dehra Dun. It was the birthplace of the second to last King of Afghanistan, Mohammed Nadir Shah. Two quaint palaces – the Kabul Palace in Dehradun and Bala Hissar Palace in Mussoorie – stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan. The Bala Hissar Palace has now been turned into Mussoorie&#x27;s Wynberg Allen School. Doon-based heritage enthusiast Ghanshyam told the Times of India, &quot;The police station at Karanpur used to be the royal guard room of Yakoob way back in 1879. The electrical office located at the Survey Chowk was the royal servants quarter.&quot;

Today the descendants of the former royalty, Yakub Khan and his grandson Sardar Azim Khan&#x27;s family have integrated with the mainstream of Dehradun life. The Doon connection was revived when Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan while undergoing treatment in New Delhi during the last years of his life expressed a desire to meet his Doon cousins but the meeting could not take place as the family members were away. Ashraf Ghani, former President of Afghanistan has mentioned that his grandmother grew up in Dehra Dun. &quot;I speak of Tagore because I was raised on Tagore by my grandmother who lived in Dehradun...,&quot; Dr Ghani said while talking about India&#x27;s vision and the remarkable transformation. Dehradun is also being selected to be the second &quot;home&quot; ground of the Afghan cricket team. and Afghan cricket fans recall this &quot;centuries old link&quot; with the town.

== Geography ==
The city of Dehradun mainly lies in Doon Valley and is at a varying height from in Clement Town to above at Malsi which is from the city. However, the average elevation is above sea level. Malsi is the starting point of Lesser Himalayan Range that extends to Mussoorie and beyond. Jaunsar-Bawar hills in Dehradun district rises to above sea level. The hilly region of Mussoorie goes up to a height of above sea level. Its geomorphological and meteorological characteristics make it prone to a number of natural hazards.

<text>Hemyock () is a village and civil parish in Devon, England. It is about 8 miles north-west of Honiton and south of the Somerset town of Wellington. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 1,519. Hemyock is part of the electoral ward of Upper Culm. The population of this ward at the above census was 4,039. The River Culm flows through Hemyock. Hemyock was the former home of the St Ivel dairy processing plant, formerly where the butter-spreads &#x27;St Ivel Gold&#x27; and &#x27;Utterly-Butterly&#x27; were produced before being moved to a factory in the north of England.

Hemyock was also the birthplace of the National Federation of Young Farmers&#x27; Clubs. The first Young Culm Farmers Club in England began here in 1921, and it continues to prosper as the Culm Valley Young Farmers Club.

Hemyock is the largest village on the Blackdown Hills, which is now designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The parish has an area of about 2350 hectares, and lies on the NW of the Blackdown Hills. Its northern boundary forms part of the Devon – Somerset border, and clockwise from there, it is surrounded by the Devon parishes of Clayhidon, Dunkeswell, Uffculme and Culmstock.

==Population==
Hemyock is a typical upland settlement consisting of a central &quot;town&quot; surrounded by a number of hamlets (Culm Davey, Millhayes, Simonsburrow, Ashculme, Tedburrow, Madford, Mountshayne etc.). From the 16th century to the early 19th century much of the parish&#x27;s wealth came from the production of wool. The population remained fairly constant throughout the 19th century, and until the end of the Second World War. Since then a number of housing estates have been built, and the population has increased to 4,039 as at the 2021 census.

==History==
The village has a very long history and some prehistoric remains may be found, from about 100 BC to well beyond. In the Middle Ages local iron ores were smelted in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron. In Saxon times a battle was fought at Simonsburrow between the Blackdown Templars, led by Godwin the Narrowminded against the heathen tribes of Culmstock.

The name Hemyock could have originated from the British stream name &quot;Samiaco&quot; (meaning summer), other authorities suggest a Saxon origin from a personal name &quot;Hemman&quot; coupled with a Saxon word for a bend or a hook (occi).

==Hemyock Hundred==
Hemyock was head of the Hemyock Hundred, an administrative sub-division of the Shire county of Devonshire, under the system of government used during the Saxon period. The Domesday Book records that the Hemyock Hundred consisted of the manors of: Awliscombe, Bolham Water, Bywood, Churchstanton (Somerset), Clayhidon, Culm Davy, Culm Pyne, Culmstock, Dunkeswell, Gorewell, Hemyock, Hole, Ivedon, Mackham, Weston.
==Hemyock Castle==
On 5 November 1380, King Richard II granted Sir William and Lady Margaret Asthorpe a licence to crenellate the Hemyock manor house; meaning the permission to fortify it. Hemyock Castle has many similarities with the much better known Bodiam Castle, granted the licence to crenellate in 1385. Over the centuries, Hemyock Castle had many notable owners including Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham and General Sir John Graves Simcoe the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada in 1792. He is buried at Wolford Chapel near Dunkeswell. The chapel is now owned by the Province of Ontario.

During the English Civil War it was held for Parliament, subjected to a brief but brutal siege and eventually &quot;slighted &quot;to destroy its military value. Parts of the castle walls, towers and moat still remain. They are a scheduled ancient monument. The castle site is privately owned: Visits can be arranged for groups; there are also public open days.

==Churches==
St Mary&#x27;s parish church is next to Hemyock Castle, on the other side of St Margaret&#x27;s Brook. The Baptist Church is at the top of Station Road.

==Notable people==
* The Cadbury family, founders of the Cadbury chocolate company, is said to have originated here.
* The Cat of Lower Greenfield [Moof Flowers, Resident of Lord Webb Manor]
* The Bard of Hemyock - an honorary title bestowed by locals on the most talented folk musician and poet of the age. Associated with the Slack-ma-Girdle variety of cider apple which the original bard is said to have cultivated in his garden.
* Morel - The Talking Tree. A local folktale of unknown origin which persists to this day tells of a talking tree named Morel. The tree&#x27;s location is disputed, but opinion leans towards Bennet’s Wood. The legend is that Morel waylays unwary travellers, trapping them in his roots before challenging them to answer a riddle in exchange for their freedom.

==Facilities==
Hemyock remains a viable village, with a school, medical facilities, one garage, one accident repair centre, two hairdressers, one public house, one convenience store, one Post Office &amp; store, two playing fields, a Parish Hall, a community centre and two churches.

==Transport==
Local bus services 20, 20A, 397, 675 are operated by Stagecoach.
Hemyock was the terminus of the Culm Valley Light Railway that ran between the village and for 99 years.

==Industry==
The first mechanically operated butter factory in the West of England was started at Mountshayne in 1886 by 4 local farmers, this was later transferred to Millhayes, subsequently becoming part of St. Ivel. It was closed in the 1990s. The site has been re-developed for housing.

==Social Life and Activities==

There are plenty of leisure time activities to choose from in Hemyock. Newcomers to the village will be pleasantly surprised by the range of cultural and hobby groups, while long term residents can still enjoy traditional Hemyock pursuits such as cowbarging and gazing wistfully at the mists over Culmstock Beacon.

<text>Technotronic was a Belgian electronic music project formed in 1987 by Jo Bogaert, best known for the 1989 single &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot;, which features vocals by Ya Kid K. The song peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. Later that year, the single was followed by the album of the same name, which peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. They achieved further success with the singles &quot;Get Up! (Before the Night Is Over)&quot; and &quot;Move This&quot;. Technotronic went on to release the albums &quot;Body to Body&quot; (1991) and &quot;Recall&quot; (1995).

==History==
===1987–1990: Formation and &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot;===
Technotronic was formed in 1987 by Jo Bogaert. Bogaert gained popularity in Europe as a solo artist with various new beat projects, including Acts of Madmen and Nux Nemo. Ya Kid K joined the project as a vocalist, Bogaert adopted the stage name Thomas De Quincey, and in September 1989, they released the single &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot;. Ya Kid K was initially uncredited for her contributions to the song. A front for the act was put together (in a way similar to other Eurodance acts like Black Box and Milli Vanilli), utilizing Congolese-born fashion model Felly Kilingi who was presented as the group&#x27;s vocalist. She appeared on the single&#x27;s cover art which was credited as &quot;Technotronic featuring Felly&quot; and also appeared in the music video for the song. The song became a worldwide success, eventually reaching No. 2 on both the US Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart in late 1989 and early 1990.

The success of the project&#x27;s first single led to the release of the album &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; in late 1989, which featured vocals by Ya Kid K and MC Eric, but still featured Felly Kilingi on the cover. The album peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US and reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. Following the release of the album, Ya Kid K was revealed to be the main vocalist for the songs, with Bogaert admitting &quot;[Felly] didn&#x27;t have much to do with the record. Me, Eric and Ya Kid did it all. We needed Felly to help promote the group at first - to create this image&quot;. In January 1990, they released their second single &quot;Get Up! (Before The Night Is Over)&quot;, which was a No. 7 hit in the US and a No. 2 hit in the UK. The music video for the song features both Ya Kid K and Felly, though Felly&#x27;s vocals do not appear on the song. That year, Technotronic made appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime at the Apollo&quot;. In February 1990, Ya Kid K and Bogaert collaborated with the group Hi Tek 3 and released the single &quot;Spin That Wheel&quot;, credited as &quot;Hi Tek 3 featuring Ya Kid K&quot;. Further singles released from &quot;Pump Up the Jam: The Album&quot; were &quot;This Beat Is Technotronic&quot; (US Dance No. 3, UK No. 14) which featured MC Eric instead of Ya Kid K, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; Over The Beat&quot; (UK No. 9). Beginning in April 1990, Technotronic became an opening act for Madonna&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour. Following the tour, Ya Kid K departed from the group. 

In September 1990, A megamix was released compiling Technotronic&#x27;s previous hits. Released as a single, it peaked at No. 6 in the UK and No. 1 on the Eurochart Hot 100. The megamix was the first single from the remix album &quot;Trip on This: The Remixes&quot;, released in late 1990. &quot;Trip on This&quot; featured the new song &quot;Turn It Up&quot; featuring vocals by new group members Melissa Bell and &quot;Another Monsterjam&quot; rapper MC Einstein. &quot;Turn It Up&quot; was not as successful as the group&#x27;s prior releases, and Melissa and Einstein departed from the group.

===1991–1994: &quot;Body to Body&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;===
In 1991, Technotronic released their second studio album &quot;Body to Body&quot;, which featured new main vocalist Reggie (Réjane Magloire). Reggie provided vocals for six tracks on the album, which also featured singer Riv and rapper Colt 45 on two tracks. Several singles were released in Europe, the UK and Australia, including &quot;Move That Body&quot;, &quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Money Makes The World Go Round&quot; during 1991 and 1992.

In 1992, the song &quot;Move This&quot; from &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; (featuring vocals by Ya Kid K) became popular through its use in a Revlon television commercial. Ya Kid K rejoined the group and the song was released as a single. It became the group&#x27;s third Top 10 hit in the United States, peaking at No. 6. With renewed interest in the &quot;Pump Up The Jam&quot; album, it was repackaged for the US market in 1992, retaining the original track listing but this time featuring Ya Kid K&#x27;s face on the cover. In 1993, Technotronic released the compilation album &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;. It included the new songs &quot;Hey Yoh Here We Go&quot; and &quot;One + One&quot;, both featuring vocals from Ya Kid K. Both songs which were released as singles in 1993 and 1994.

===1995–2001: &quot;Recall&quot; and later releases===
Continuing with Ya Kid K as frontwoman, Technotronic released the single &quot;Move It to the Rhythm&quot; in 1994. It was followed in 1995 by the album &quot;Recall&quot; and the further singles &quot;Recall&quot; and &quot;I Want You by My Side&quot;, the latter of which features male singer Black Diamond. Beside vocal contributions from Ya Kid K, the album also featured singer Daisy Dee on two tracks.

In 1996, the group released the remix EP &quot;Pump Up The Jam – The &#x27;96 Sequel&quot;, followed in 1998 by the single &quot;Get Up – The &#x27;98 Sequel&quot; as well as compilations &quot;This Beat Is Technotronic (Hits &amp; Mixes)&quot; and &quot;Pump Up The Hits&quot;.

Technotronic returned in 1999 with new singles &quot;G-Train&quot; and &quot;Like This&quot;, featuring male vocalist Monday Midnite. In 2000, Ya Kid K returned as the group&#x27;s vocalist once more, releasing the non-album single &quot;The Mariachi&quot; to moderate success in Belgium. In 2001, Technotronic released the standalone single &quot;Runaway Blues&quot;.

<text>Hellbillies is a Norwegian rock band, formed in 1990 in Ål, a town located in Hallingdal.

== Profile and history ==
Hellbellies are among Norway&#x27;s most popular recording artists. As of 2012, they have released 13 albums—including a compilation and two live albums—as well as three live concert DVDs. Their lyrics are written and sung in the dialect of the Hallingdal area of Norway, and there is evidence of influence from traditional (folk) Norwegian music, giving a distinctive &quot;Norwegian&quot; flavor to their country music.

Their early albums often included songs originally recorded by country music artists from the US with Hellbillies writing new lyrics in the Ål dialect of Norwegian, with the settings of the lyrics differing sharply from the source songs. Examples include &quot;Ei krasafaren steinbu&quot; (&quot;Past the Point of Rescue&quot; by Hal Ketchum) and &quot;Pela stein&quot; (&quot;Against the Grain&quot; by Garth Brooks).

Later efforts have included much more original material that reflect contemporary Norwegian people and Norwegian life and issues. They have also gradually changed their musical style from country to rock.

They have collaborated with musicians from the US. For example, Rob Hajacos from Nashville, who plays the fiddle on most Garth Brooks albums, Rob plays on three of Hellbillies’ albums.

In 2013 Hellbillies appeared at the Kongsberg Jazz Festival performing together with Jazz guests the Violin virtuoso Ola Kvernberg and the super trumpeter Mathias Eick. In 2013 they also contributed to the book &quot;Think Like a Rockstar&quot; (&quot;Tenk som en rockestjerne&quot;, written by Ståle Økland.

<doc id="1156051" wikidata="Q2463395" url="?curid=1156051" title="Lithotripsy">
<text>Lithotripsy is a procedure involving the physical destruction of hardened masses like kidney stones, bezoars or gallstones, which may be done non-invasively. The term is derived from the Greek words meaning &quot;breaking (or pulverizing) stones&quot; ( + [tripso]).

== Uses ==
Lithotripsy is a non-invasive procedure used to break up hardened masses like kidney stones, bezoars or gallstones.

== Contraindications ==
Commonly cited absolute contraindications to shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) include pregnancy, coagulopathy or use of platelet aggregation inhibitors, aortic aneurysms, severe untreated hypertension, and untreated urinary tract infections.

==Techniques==
* Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (lithotripsy)
* Intracorporeal (endoscopic lithotripsy): 
** Laser lithotripsy: effective for larger stones (&gt;2 cm) with good stone-free and complication rates.
** Electro hydraulic lithotripsy
** Mechanical lithotripsy
** Ultrasonic lithotripsy: safer for small stones (&lt;10 mm)

==History==
Surgery was the only method to remove stones too large to pass until French surgeon and urologist Jean Civiale in 1832 invented a surgical instrument (the lithotrite) to crush stones inside the urinary bladder without having to open the abdomen. To remove a calculus, Civiale inserted his instrument through the urethra and bored holes in the stone. Afterwards, he crushed it with the same instrument and aspirated the resulting fragments or let them flow normally with urine.

Lithotripsy replaced using lithotrites as the most common treatment beginning in the mid 1980s. In extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), external shockwaves are focused at the stone to pulverize it. Ureteroscopic methods use a rigid or flexible scope to reach the stone and direct mechanical or light energy at it. Endoscopy can use lasers as well as other modes of energy delivery: ultrasound or electrohydraulics.

ESWL was first used on kidney stones in 1980. It is also applied to gallstones and pancreatic stones. External shockwaves are focused and pulverize the stone which is located by imaging. The first shockwave lithotriptor approved for human use was the Dornier HM3 (human model 3) derived from a device used for testing aerospace parts. Second generation devices used piezoelectricity or electromagnetism generators. American Urological Association guidelines consider ESWL a potential primary treatment for stones between 4 mm and 2 cm.

Electrohydraulic lithotripsy is an industrial technique for fragmenting rocks by using electrodes to create shockwaves. It was applied to bile duct stones in 1975. It can damage tissue and is mostly used in biliary tract specialty centers. Pneumatic mechanical devices have been used with endoscopes, commonly for large and hard stones.

Laser lithotripsy was introduced in the 1980s. Pulsed dye lasers emit 504 nm (cyan-colored) light that is delivered to the stone by optical fibers through a scope. Holmium:YAG lasers were developed more recently and produce smaller fragments.

Endovascular lithotripsy is an angioplasty procedure using a balloon internally fitted with an ultrasound generator. It can be used in the reduction of very calcified coronary arteries, with or without the combined usage of stents.

<text>Andrew Ralph Adamson (born 1 December 1966) is a New Zealand film director, producer, screenwriter and animator. He is best known for directing the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), which is based on the children&#x27;s picture book of the same name by American author William Steig and won the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 74th Academy Awards ceremony. He also directed and co-wrote the first two live-action film adaptations of C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; novels: &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (2005) and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; (2008).

== Personal life ==
Adamson&#x27;s parents were a homemaker and a computer engineer. Born in New Zealand, Adamson moved to Papua New Guinea with his parents when he was eleven years old. He returned to Auckland seven years later. At age 24, he moved to San Francisco, and divided his time between there and Los Angeles. Since making the &quot;Narnia&quot; films, he has settled back in New Zealand. Adamson has two children.

==Career==

Adamson wanted to be an architect, but missed a university enrollment deadline because of a car accident. He was recruited by Pacific Data Images to work in the USA. The company opened an office in Los Angeles. There he served as a technical director for &quot;Toys&quot; (1992), starring Robin Williams, and &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1994), starring Danny Glover. Previously, Adamson specialised in ads but preferred the idea of telling a story in longer format. He served as visual effects supervisor in the 1995 film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997).

Adamson directed &quot;Shrek&quot; (the first installment in the series), based on the 1990 picture book written by William Steig with a modest budget of US$60 million in 2001. However, the film became a worldwide success, taking in nearly $500 million in the box office, including more than $40 million in its opening weekend. The film featured the lead voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow. The next film in the series, &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004), had a big Hollywood budget of around $150 million, and was even a bigger success than the first film, taking in more than $900 million worldwide. The film opened to over $100 million, one of the highest openings ever at the time. Adamson directed this film and also wrote the story.
However, he did not direct the next film in the series, &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, as he had been contracted by Walden Media to work on &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Instead, the film was directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui while Adamson served as executive producer. The script of the film was written by J. David Stem and Joe Stillman. The third film was financially successful, taking in more than $795 million worldwide with a budget of no more than $160 million, but received mixed reviews from critics.

Adamson achieved commercial success and worldwide attention with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, which he co-produced, co-wrote and directed. The film is based on the book of the same name by C. S. Lewis, and won various awards, gained critical praise and was a box office success, becoming the third highest-grossing film worldwide of 2005 according to Box Office Mojo. The film opened in the US and Canada with totals of higher than $65 million and the film ended up with a worldwide gross of $744,783,957 with a budget of $180 million according to Box Office Mojo.

He returned as director to the next Narnia film: &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;, which had a worldwide release in May 2008 and grossed over $419 million at the box office. Adamson returned as producer of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, released in Australia on 9 December 2010, and in the United States and UK on 10 December the same year. 20th Century Fox and Walden Media still hold the rights to the series, and they currently retain the option to make &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair&quot; in the future. However, 20th Century Fox and Walden Media decided to produce &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; as the next Narnia film instead of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;. But, in October 2011, Douglas Gresham confirmed that Walden Media&#x27;s contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired, and any production of a future film was on hold indefinitely.

Experimental hip hop group Death Grips worked with Adamson on their 2018 album &quot;Year of the Snitch&quot;. He appears on the track &quot;Dilemma,&quot; delivering a spoken word introduction to the song.

<doc id="1156060" wikidata="Q1045517" url="?curid=1156060" title="Wonderwall">
<text>&quot;Wonderwall&quot; is a song by English rock band Oasis, released by Creation Records on 30 October 1995 as the fourth single from the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;. Described by lead guitarist and chief songwriter Noel Gallagher, who wrote the song and co-produced it with Owen Morris, as being about &quot;an imaginary friend who&#x27;s gonna come and save you from yourself&quot;, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; reached the top ten in 15 countries; it topped the charts in Australia and New Zealand, peaked at 2 on both the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart, and reached the top 10 in Canada and the United States, reaching No. 5 and No. 8, respectively, thus becoming the band&#x27;s sole top-40 entry on the latter country&#x27;s main &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The single was certified octuple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and 12-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Its music video, directed by Nigel Dick, won British Video of the Year at the 1996 Brit Awards.

&quot;Wonderwall&quot; remains one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs. In Australia, it was voted No. 1 on the alternative music radio station Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of 1995 and &quot;20 Years of the Hottest 100&quot; in 2013. Many artists have also covered the song, such as Ryan Adams, Cat Power, and Brad Mehldau. In October 2020, it became the first song from the 1990s to reach one billion streams on Spotify. As of 2024, &#x27;Wonderwall&#x27; placed at number 86 in list of Spotify streaming records. With 2.23 billion streams on Spotify, the song has become the second most streamed song from the 1990s, behind Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;&#x27;s 2.25 billion streams. 

==Production history==
The song was originally titled &quot;Wishing Stone&quot;. Gallagher told &quot;NME&quot; in 1996 that &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was written for Meg Mathews, his then-girlfriend and later wife. However, after Gallagher and Mathews divorced in 2001, he said the song was not about her: &quot;The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it, and how do you tell your Mrs it&#x27;s not about her once she&#x27;s read it is? It&#x27;s a song about an imaginary friend who&#x27;s gonna come and save you from yourself.&quot; The song&#x27;s final title was inspired by George Harrison&#x27;s solo album &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot;.

The song was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales, during a two-week recording of the &quot;Morning Glory&quot; album in May 1995. Morris produced the song in a half-day along with Gallagher, using a technique known as &quot;brickwalling&quot; to intensify the sound of the song. Liam Gallagher served as lead singer on the song after Noel had given him a choice between &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;, another single from the album, with Noel singing lead vocals on the latter. All of the band&#x27;s members except bassist Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan contributed to the recording, with Noel playing bass instead of McGuigan. This decision displeased Liam, who told Morris, &quot;That&#x27;s not Oasis.&quot;

&quot;Wonderwall&quot; is written in the key of F minor and is set in common time with a moderate dance groove. Liam Gallagher&#x27;s voice ranges from an E3 to an F4 in the song.

==Live performances==

Noel Gallagher debuted the song on UK television backstage at Glastonbury, and it was broadcast on Channel 4 on 24 June 1995. The song was not performed by the band during their headline performance the night before. The song went on to be regularly played on the (What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory? Tour where it was typically played and sung solo by Noel acoustically. On occasions however (including the Maine Road and Knebworth gigs) it was played by the full band acoustically with Liam on vocals. The song was also regularly played on both the Be Here Now Tour and Standing on the Shoulder of Giants Tour, performances on these tours featured the full band on electric guitars with Liam on vocals.

For the Heathen Chemistry Tour, Noel changed the arrangement of his live performances of the song to a style he admitted was heavily influenced by Ryan Adams&#x27; cover. For the Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth Tour, the original arrangement was used for live performances by the full band with electric guitars and Liam on vocals. During the 2008 tour, the band returned to performing the song in a semi-acoustic form, in an arrangement closely resembling the album version. This song was also performed during the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony by Liam Gallagher and his post Oasis band Beady Eye.

Since Oasis split up, both Noel and Liam have continued to play the song as part of Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds and Liam&#x27;s solo career, respectively. Both have often varied the presentation of the song, sometimes being performed in stripped down acoustic versions, whilst other times more full band arrangements have been performed.

==Critical reception==
Steve Baltin from &quot;Cash Box&quot; named &quot;Wonderwall&quot; Pick of the Week, describing the song as &quot;a perfect example of melodic pop.&quot; He added, &quot;Following the more uptempo riff of &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, this single will remind listeners of the anthemic single &quot;Live Forever&quot;, a track that generated massive airplay on multiple formats last year. Look for the same results for this lovely near ballad. A simple, sweet song, it shows why Oasis is rapidly becoming one of music&#x27;s great singles bands.&quot; Kevin Courtney from &quot;Irish Times&quot; declared it as a &quot;genuine Oasis gem&quot;, &quot;with its aching string arrangements and evocative vocals&quot;. Michael Bonner from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named it Single of the Week, praising it as &quot;a mesmeric declaration of love — haunting, beautiful and effortlessly simple — and, unless you&#x27;ve been locked in a coal cellar for the last two months, you should know it forwards, backwards and sideways by now.&quot; Another &quot;Melody Maker&quot; editor, David Stubbs, said, &quot;&#x27;Wonderwall&#x27;, with its explicit George Harrison reference, doesn&#x27;t bother to conceal another nod at The Beatles, but the real problem here is that Liam doesn&#x27;t seem capable of modulating his voice to suit the pensively orchestrated backdrop — a bit of a subtlety deficiency.&quot; 

Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; wrote, &quot;A swirling rock song that slowly builds to epic proportions. Nicely chiming acoustic guitars and psyched-up strings support Liam Gallagher&#x27;s trademark declamatory and plaintive vocals. Not the easiest song for EHR, but a sure grower.&quot; John Robinson from &quot;NME&quot; commented, &quot;&#x27;Wonderwall&#x27; instead turns out to be the best example of Liam&#x27;s indispensability to Noel as we are plunged into the depths of a doomed urban romance. Fires have gone out, wills to live have departed, yet we still witness Liam questioning whether &quot;Maybe you could be the one to save me&quot;. And yet the entirely twisted delivery turns it from a slightly sappy idea into a fantastically bleak song, adding an all-consuming anger to the sense of desperation.&quot; In a separate review, Robinson felt it &quot;is one of Oasis&#x27; best records because it manages to be immensely robust while still being one of Noel&#x27;s most lyrically personal songs&quot;. Andrew Harrison from &quot;Select&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;Wonderwall&#x27; is a near acoustic song that wears many signs of its maturity, but heavily. There is a (good) attempt to resonate personal failure with the redemptive power of The Beatles (&quot;Backbeat, the word is on the street/That the fire in your eyes is out&quot;). Liam goes flat once too often on the chorus.&quot; Leesa Daniels from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it a top score of five out of five and named it &quot;Oasis&#x27; version of a love song.&quot; She added, &quot;Absolutely beautiful.&quot; Another &quot;Smash Hits&quot; editor, Mark Frith, praised it as a highlight of the album, &quot;mid-paced, brilliantly sung by Liam and, if it wasn&#x27;t for Queen [&#x27;Heaven for Everyone&#x27;], a No. 1 hit!&quot;

==Music video==
The original music video to the song conceived by Johanna Bautista was filmed by British music video and film director Nigel Dick at Unit 217B in Woolwich, London, on 30 September 1995. The filming of the promotional video took place during the brief period when bassist Guigsy quit the band due to nervous exhaustion, and was replaced by Scott McLeod, who appears in the video along with the four other members of the band. The song won British Video of the Year at the 1996 Brit Awards.

A second video depicts the band sitting down throughout the video with some getting up and leaving before returning. The video ends with Noel, Alan White and Scott McLeod leaving their seats, leaving Liam and Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs in their seats.

==Cover art==
The sleeve artwork was inspired by the paintings of the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, and was shot on Primrose Hill in London by Michael Spencer Jones. The hand holding the frame is that of art director Brian Cannon. The original idea was to have Liam in the frame before Noel vetoed that idea whilst the shoot was taking place. Instead, a female figure was deemed necessary, so Creation Records employee Anita Heryet was asked to stand in as cover star for the shot.

==Chart and sales performance==
&quot;Wonderwall&quot; reached the No. 2 spot in both Ireland and the United Kingdom in October and November 1995. In the UK, the song was held off the top spot by &quot;I Believe&quot; by Robson &amp; Jerome. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; finished at No. 10 on the year-end chart for 1995 and at No. 26 on the 1990s decade-end in the UK. The track has sold and streamed 4.8 million units in the UK as of November 2024, certifying the song octuple platinum and making it Oasis&#x27; biggest-selling song in their homeland. In August 2024, in light of the announcement of the band&#x27;s reunion tour, &quot;Wonderwall&quot; re-entered at 17 in the UK, alongside &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back In Anger&quot; at 16 and &quot;Live Forever&quot; at 19.

In the United States, the song peaked at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart for a then-unprecedented ten weeks and reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March 1996, becoming their only top-10 hit on the latter chart. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; also proved to be a major hit in Australia and New Zealand, claiming the No. 1 spot in both countries. In Canada, the song reached No. 5 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 chart and topped the &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30 ranking.

==The Mike Flowers Pops version==

British band the Mike Flowers Pops released an easy listening version of &quot;Wonderwall&quot; that reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart—just as the Oasis original had done two months earlier—during Christmas 1995. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1996, it earned a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments exceeding 200,000 copies. This cover also peaked within the top 10 of the charts in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden.

Noel Gallagher mentioned that when BBC Radio 1 premiered the song, they jokingly claimed that they had found &quot;the original version of Wonderwall&quot;. Gallagher, who had been in America at the time, was surprised to be asked by one of his record company&#x27;s executives if he had actually written the song.

==Other cover versions==
Ryan Adams&#x27; version, first performed in 2001, and later released in 2003 on &quot;Love Is Hell pt. 1 EP&quot;, was well received by Noel Gallagher. It was featured in &quot;The O.C.&quot; episode &quot;The Heartbreak&quot;. It was featured in the final scenes of the &quot;Smallville&quot; Season 3 episode &quot;Velocity&quot; and the first season of the Israeli documentary series &quot;Couchsurfers&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Gallagher said &quot;I think Ryan Adams is the only person who ever got that song right.&quot;

Paul Anka covered the song on his swing album &quot;Rock Swings&quot;, released in 2005 and was used as figure skater Paul Fentz&#x27;s backing track during his 2018 Winter Olympics performance in Pyeongchang, South Korea. This version sparked an internet meme at the time.

American rapper Jay-Z often has his crowds sing &quot;Wonderwall&quot; after his song &quot;Jockin&#x27; Jay-Z&quot;, which includes a reference to Noel Gallagher&#x27;s criticism of the rapper&#x27;s involvement in the typically rock-centric Glastonbury Festival in 2008. It launched a war of words between Jay Z and Oasis, with Oasis&#x27; rhythm guitarist Gem Archer describing Jay Z&#x27;s actions as akin to an &quot;eight-year-old girl.&quot; After Oasis broke up, Jay Z later claimed he would like to work with Liam Gallagher.

In 2025, English rock band Bring Me the Horizon released a cover of &quot;Wonderwall&quot; as part of the &quot;Spotify Singles&quot; series, putting their own metal twist on the song. Frontman Liam Gallagher responded to the cover positively, calling it &quot;absolutely incredible&quot;. It peaked at number 30 on the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles Chart and number 11 on the US Hot Hard Rock Songs chart.

===Mashups===
&quot;Wonderwall&quot; was featured in the popular mashup &quot;Boulevard of Broken Songs&quot; mixed by Party Ben in late 2004, which also contained parts of both Travis&#x27;s &quot;Writing to Reach You&quot; (which contains the line &quot;Radio is playing all the usual / what&#x27;s a Wonderwall anyway?&quot;) and Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;. In late 2006, Gallagher accused Green Day of &#x27;ripping off&#x27; &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, saying &quot;If you listen, you&#x27;ll find it is exactly the same arrangement as &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I, at least, pay the people I steal from that courtesy&quot;.

Neil Cicierega&#x27;s mashup albums &quot;Mouth Silence&quot; and &quot;Mouth Moods&quot; feature tracks that are mashups of &quot;Wonderwall&quot; titled &quot;Wndrwll&quot; and &quot;Wallspin&quot;, the former a humorous remix featuring &quot;Everywhere You Look&quot; and the latter a mashup with &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)&quot;.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Wonderwall&quot; is the team song of Minnesota United FC of Major League Soccer, sung after every home victory. The overarching fan organisation is MNWonderwall. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; is also played after all Manchester City F.C. home games. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; is the pre-match song for Australian A-League Men side Adelaide United.

In the TV show &quot;Lost&quot;, in a flashback, the character Desmond Hume sees Charlie on the streets of London singing the song to him. Ironically, or rather coincidentally, Charlie &quot;saves&quot; Desmond several times once they&#x27;re on the island together. 

On 7 April 2011, Mr. 305 artist Jamie Drastik released the song &quot;Save Me&quot; which heavily samples &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. It is the lead single from Jamie&#x27;s mixtape &quot;Champagne and Cocaine&quot;. The song also features a verse from Jamie&#x27;s mentor and Mr. 305 boss Pitbull. Jamie performed &quot;Save Me&quot; all around the world, including on the Planet Pit World Tour. The song achieved major radio success all across the US. It is currently the most popular song from &quot;Champagne and Cocaine&quot;.

In the &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; episode, &quot;Make Rebecca Great Again&quot;, the character Sam Obisanya played by Toheeb Jimoh, sings &quot;Wonderwall&quot; at a karaoke bar in Liverpool. He and his teammates are out celebrating his team&#x27;s first victory at Everton in 60 years.

<text>Smelling salts, also known as ammonia inhalants, spirit of hartshorn, or sal volatile, are chemical compounds used as stimulants to restore consciousness after fainting.

== Usage ==
The usual active compound is ammonium carbonate—a colorless-to-white, crystalline solid ((NH4)2CO3). Because most modern solutions are mixed with water, they should properly be called &quot;aromatic spirits of ammonia&quot;. Modern solutions may also contain other products to perfume or act in conjunction with the ammonia, such as lavender oil or eucalyptus oil.

Historically, smelling salts have been used on people feeling faint, or who have fainted. They are usually administered by others but may be self-administered.

Smelling salts are often used on athletes who have been dazed or knocked unconscious to restore consciousness and mental alertness. Smelling salts are now banned in most boxing competitions because of the concern that their effect could mask a more serious injury.

They are also used as a form of stimulant in athletic competitions (such as powerlifting, strong man, rugby and ice hockey) to &quot;wake up&quot; competitors to perform better. In 2005, Michael Strahan estimated that 70–80% of National Football League players were using smelling salts as stimulants.

== History ==
Smelling salts have been used since Roman times and are mentioned in the writings of Pliny as &quot;Hammoniacus sal&quot;. Evidence exists of use in the 13th century by alchemists as sal ammoniac. In the 14th-century &quot;The Canon&#x27;s Yeoman&#x27;s Tale&quot;, one of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, an alchemist purports to use &quot;sal armonyak&quot;. In the 17th century, the distillation of an ammonia solution from shavings of harts&#x27; (deer) horns and hooves led to the alternative name for smelling salts as spirit or salt of hartshorn.

They were widely used in Victorian Britain to revive fainting women, and in some areas, constables would carry a container of them for that purpose. At that time, smelling salts were commonly dissolved with perfume in vinegar or alcohol and soaked onto a sponge, which was then carried on the person in a decorative container called a vinaigrette. The &quot;sal volatile&quot; appears several times in Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;.

The use of smelling salts was widely recommended during the Second World War, with all workplaces advised by the British Red Cross and St. John Ambulance to keep smelling salts in their first aid boxes.

== Physiological action ==
Solid ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate salts partly dissociate to form , and vapour as follows:


The smelling salts release ammonia () gas, which triggers an inhalation reflex. It causes the muscles that control breathing to work faster by irritating the mucous membranes of the nose and lungs.

Fainting can be caused by excessive parasympathetic and vagal activity that slows the heart and decreases perfusion of the brain. The sympathetic irritant effect is exploited to counteract these vagal parasympathetic effects and thereby reverse the faint.

== Risks ==
Exposure to ammonia gas in large concentrations for prolonged periods is toxic and can be fatal. If a high concentration of ammonia is inhaled too close to the nostril, it might burn the nasal or oral mucosa. The suggested distance is .

The use of ammonia smelling salts to revive people injured during sport is not recommended because it may inhibit or delay a proper and thorough neurological assessment by a healthcare professional, such as after concussions when hospitalization may be advisable, and some governing bodies recommend specifically against it. The irritant nature of smelling salts means that they can exacerbate any pre-existing cervical spine injury by causing reflex withdrawal away from them, although this has been found to be a result of holding the smelling salts closer to the nose than recommended.

<text>The Rye and Camber Tramway was an English railway in East Sussex. It was of narrow gauge, relatively unusual amongst British narrow gauge railways. It operated from 1895 until 1939, connecting Rye to the coast. It was about in length, and had three stations – Rye, Golf Links and Camber Sands. It operated mainly to transport golfers to the golf links and holidaymakers to the coastal dunes.

==History==

The railway was constructed between January and July 1895 and ran entirely on private land. It was the first designed by consulting engineer Holman F. Stephens, who went on to build and run small railways all over the Country.

The line was built to convey golfers to the Rye Golf Club and ran from Rye (R&amp;CT) station to the golf club. In 1908 the first extension to Camber Sands station was opened and the intermediate station renamed &quot;Golf Links&quot;. Camber Sands terminal was moved to a more accessible site and a tea hut was opened at the end of summer 1938, but this only used for a few months as the war intervened the next year.

Although initially quite successful, increasing competition from automobile and bus transport eventually caused the tramway to enter a gradual economic decline, as was the case with many small railways. Passenger service was ended at the outbreak of World War II but it was extensively used by the Government to convey parts for the P.L.U.T.O. (Pipe Line Under The Ocean) project for which a special siding leading to a new pier near Golf Links Station was constructed by Canadian troops.

The line was in such a run-down a condition by the end of the war that it was deemed irrecoverable and was sold for scrap in 1947. The Rye &amp; Camber Tramways Co. Ltd was liquidated in February 1949.

==Remains==

A number of relics, including the frame and bogies of one of the carriages, can be seen at the Colonel Stephens Museum at Tenterden.

Golf Links station building survives virtually intact. Some track is embedded in concrete near the station as the trackbed was used as a roadway during wartime. Most of the route is a footpath, although a short section has been destroyed by gravel workings.

The line plays a prominent part in several novels by Rye resident E. F. Benson.

==Rolling stock==

===Locomotives===

There were two small Bagnall steam locomotives, &quot;Camber&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;, but in later years a small petrol locomotive was used exclusively.

=== Carriages ===

The tramway had two enclosed carriages, one built by Bagnall and the other by The Rother Iron Works, Rye. Two four-wheel wagons were also fitted with seats for passengers and several locally-built four-wheel wagons were used to convey sand from the beach for local builders. Several temporary sidings were constructed at the Camber end for this purpose, where the dug-out dunes can still be seen.

<text>Varicode is a self-synchronizing code for use in PSK31. It supports all ASCII characters, but the characters used most frequently in English have shorter codes. The space between characters is indicated by a 00 sequence, an implementation of Fibonacci coding. Originally created for speeding up real-time keyboard-to-keyboard exchanges over low bandwidth links, Varicode is freely available.

==Limitations==
* Varicode provides somewhat weaker compression in languages other than English that use same characters as in English.

==Varicode table==

===Control characters===
===Printable characters===

===Character lengths===
Beginning with the single-bit code &quot;1&quot;, valid varicode values may be formed by prefixing a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;10&quot; to a shorter code. Thus, the number of codes of length &quot;n&quot; is equal to the Fibonacci number &quot;Fn&quot;. Varicode uses the 88 values of lengths up to 9 bits, and 40 of the 55 codes of length 10.

As transmitted, the codes are two bits longer due to the trailing delimiter 00.

<text>Tumen, or tümen (&quot;unit of ten thousand&quot;;
Old Turkic: on bıñ; , &quot;tümen&quot;; ; ), was a decimal unit of measurement used by the Turkic and Mongol peoples to quantify and organize their societies in groups of 10,000. A &quot;tumen&quot; denotes a tribal unit of 10,000 households, or a military unit of 10,000 soldiers.

English Orientalist Sir Gerard Clauson (1891-1974) defined &quot;tümän&quot; as immediately borrowed from Tokharian &quot;tmān&quot;, which according to Edwin G. Pulleyblank might have been etymologically inherited from Old Chinese &quot;tman&quot; or .

==Magyar military organization of the conquest era==
It was thought that the same kind of military organization was used by the Magyars during the conquest of Hungary. According to Ahmad ibn Rustah (c. 930), a Persian explorer and geographer relying on second-hand information, the &quot;Magyars are a race of Turks and their king rides out with horsemen to the number of 10,000 and this king is called Kanda&quot;.

==Genghis Khan&#x27;s organization==
In Genghis Khan&#x27;s military system, a tumen was recursively built from units of 10 (aravt), 100 (zuut) and 1,000 (mingghan), each with a leader reporting to the next higher level. Tumens were considered a practical size, neither too small for an effective campaign nor too big for efficient transport and supply. The military strategy was based on the use of tumens as a useful building block causing reasonable shock and attack. A Mongol army usually consisted out of three tumen, but armies consisting of only one tumen were also deployed. Regardless, tumen would often be understrength and the number of tumen deployed doesn&#x27;t provide an accurate number of combatants.

The commander of a tumen was a &quot;tümen-ü noyan&quot;, a term sometimes translated &quot;myriarch&quot; (cf. myriad), meaning commander of 10,000.

== In modern armies ==
Tümen is a military unit which is still used in the Turkish Army, consisting of 6,000 to 10,000 soldiers. Its commander is a tümgeneral in the Army and Air Forces and a tümamiral in the Naval Forces. It is the equivalent of a modern division.

<text>Kristine Sutherland (born Kristine Young; April 17, 1955) is an American actress best known for her starring role as Buffy Summers&#x27; mother Joyce Summers on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, where she appeared in every season (1997–2003), and her role as Mae Thompson in &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989).

==Early life==
She was born Kristine Young in Boise, Idaho, and changed her name because she was often confused with another similarly named actress. The last name &quot;Sutherland&quot; was after her cat, whom she named &quot;Donald&quot; after Donald Sutherland, who, coincidentally, had a role in the original &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; film, Joss Whedon&#x27;s first attempt to bring Buffy to audiences. She is not related to Donald Sutherland, his sons Kiefer, Rossif and Angus, or his granddaughter Sarah Sutherland.

She attended high school in Lexington, Kentucky, where she participated in the Tates Creek Drama program. After graduating, she enrolled in the University of Kentucky.

==Career==
Sutherland&#x27;s first film role was as a secretary in &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1986). She appeared as Mae Thompson in the 1989 film &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;. Her career received a big boost when she played Buffy&#x27;s mother in the action-horror television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, from 1997 to 2002. Creator Joss Whedon later stated that one of the reasons he chose Sutherland for the role was that she exuded a warm demeanor, as well as what he believed to be a close resemblance to actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who was to portray her daughter in the series. She appeared regularly on the show for the first five seasons before leaving, but returned for three more appearances, one in season 6 and two in season 7.

After leaving &quot;Buffy&quot;, Sutherland attended a photography course at the Santa Monica College and subsequently set up a studio specializing in portraits. In 2008, she appeared in the television miniseries &quot;Comanche Moon&quot; and had a guest role in an episode of &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;.

She voiced Haru&#x27;s Mother in the English dub of &quot;The Cat Returns&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sutherland is married to actor John Pankow. They have one daughter.

<text>Long Man is a civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England, which includes the villages of Wilmington, Milton Street and Folkington. The parish is named after the Long Man of Wilmington, a chalk figure in the parish.

The parish extends far from the left bank of the modest River Cuckmere where it starts to cut through the South Downs; the Cuckmere Valley lies immediately south. The A27 trunk road crosses the parish from west to east. The Wealdway long distance footpath also passes through the parish. The parish was formed on 1 April 1999 from &quot;Folkington&quot; and &quot;Wilmington&quot; parishes.

==Settlements==
===Wilmington===
Wilmington is about 6 miles north-west of Eastbourne in East Sussex. In the village there is the 12th-century Parish Church of St Mary and St Peter; adjoining it are the ruins of the 12th-century Wilmington Priory. The local public house is &quot;The Giant&#x27;s Rest&quot;.
The Wishing Well Tea Gardens are some of the oldest in Sussex, established 1900. The hotel &quot;Crossways&quot; is an archetypal Georgian brick and stone house, once home to the parents of international culinary guru, Elizabeth David.

The place-name &#x27;Wilmington&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Wineltone&quot; and &quot;Wilminte&quot;. It appears as &quot;Wilmetun&quot; in 1212 in the &quot;Book of Fees&quot;. The name means &#x27;the town or settlement of Wighelm&#x27;s or Wilhelm&#x27;s people&#x27;.
===Folkington===
Folkington village lies beyond a green buffer, east of Wilmington. The church is dedicated to St Peter ad Vincula and was formerly under the patronage of Earl De La Warr. Folkington Manor was the seat of the Thomas family: the current manor house dates from the 1830s.

Current and former residents include broadcaster David Dimbleby, Bridget Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland and Harry Brünjes.

===Milton Street===
This hamlet is home to the Sussex Ox pub.
Milton Street was the setting of an episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; in which determined efforts are made to extinguish the sun.

==Landmarks==

Milton Gate Marsh, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies within the parish. It is a wetland area of biological importance for invertebrates and breeding birds. Amongst the fauna found here is the nationally rare hoverfly &quot;Cheilosia chrysocoma&quot;. Another SSSI is Wilmington Downs, which is of biological interest as an area of rare chalk grassland. The area is also of archaeological interest as it contains the Long Man chalk figure.

==Governance==
The lowest level of government is the Long Man parish council which meets once a month; is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. They also provide a voice into the district council meetings. For elections, the parish is divided into three wards, Wilmington (four seats), Milton Street (two seats) and Folkington (one seat).

Wealden District Council is the second tier of local government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Long Man is in the East Dean ward, along with the Friston and Cuckmere Valley parishes. The single seat was won in the May 2007 election by the Conservative candidate.

East Sussex County Council is the top tier of local government, providing education, libraries, social services and highways. Long Man falls within the Polegate, Willingdon and East Dean division which elects two councillors.

At Westminster (General Elections) the relevant seat is Lewes.

<text>Someone Like You is a musical with a book by Robin Midgley and Fay Weldon, lyrics by Dee Shipman, and music by Petula Clark.

Based on a concept developed by Clark and Ferdie Pacheco over a period of several years, it is set in West Virginia immediately after the end of the Civil War. Originally entitled &quot;Amen&quot;, it was conceived as a dark view of the difficulties Southerners faced dealing with carpetbaggers during the Reconstruction period, and also dealt with the problems of morphine-addicted Confederate soldiers returning home. It lost many of its serious overtones as the project evolved; Clark and Shipman&#x27;s original book was revised substantially by Weldon (who also contributed the new title), and the plot became convoluted, often bordering on the ridiculous. Shipman later stated, &quot;For all the faults there were in the original book . . . it was better than the hybrid we ended up with because it had passion.&quot;

The story centers on Abigail Kane, who journeys to America from her native England with her son Andy in search of her preacher husband, who allegedly had gone to the States to participate in the skirmish between North and South. She comes to the aid of the Major, a doctor struggling to care for a multitude of injured soldiers without the benefit of medical supplies, and soon discovers her missing husband is involved in shady dealings not usually associated with a man of the cloth. Drawn together out of both necessity and desire, Abigail and the Major forsake their marital vows and become involved in a passionate romance.

Directed by Midgley, the musical premiered on 25 October 1989 at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in Cambridge, and in his review in the &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot;, Alan Kersey wrote, &quot;Petula Clark proved last night at the world premiere of &quot;Someone Like You&quot; that she can still work wonders both on stage and in the tough real world of show business.&quot; The production toured the UK through 9 December.

On 22 March 1990, &quot;Someone Like You&quot; opened at the Strand Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. In addition to Clark, it starred Dave Willetts (&quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;) as the Major, Clive Carter as Kane (roles in which Clark had hoped Andy Williams and Sting would be cast) and Lewis Rae as Andy. Reviews were mixed, although most critics praised Clark&#x27;s performance and her contribution to the score.

Due to financial difficulties faced by producer Harold Fielding, all his assets were seized, and the show closed without warning after the 25 April performance. Although an original cast album was never released at the time, Clark&#x27;s recordings of several of the tunes were issued on various CDs throughout the ensuing years.

A studio recording of the score was released by Sepia Records in May 2007. With arrangements by the show&#x27;s original musical director and arranger, Kenny Clayton, it features vocals by Debi Doss, Andrew Derbyshire, and Lewis Rae, who appeared in the original production as young Andy. Clayton is featured on piano and keyboards, with David Martin on guitar and Eric Young on percussion.

<text>16 Cook Street, Liverpool is the world&#x27;s second glass curtain walled building. Designed by Peter Ellis in 1866, it is a Grade II* Listed Building.

Built two years after Oriel Chambers on Water Street, the architect&#x27;s best-known work, it shows the development of Ellis&#x27; style. Its floor to ceiling glass allows light to penetrate deep into the building, contrasting strongly with the adjacent structures. It has been suggested that American architect John Root was influenced by the construction of both buildings, having studied in Liverpool at the time of their construction.

Both 16 Cook Street and Oriel Chambers were featured in the ITV (Granada / Tyne Tees) television programme &quot;Grundy&#x27;s Northern Pride&quot;, looking at John Grundy&#x27;s favourite buildings in the north of England, aired on 9 January 2007.

<doc id="1156109" wikidata="Q3259792" url="?curid=1156109" title="Los Muñequitos de Matanzas">
<text>Los Muñequitos de Matanzas is a Cuban rumba ensemble from the city of Matanzas. The group was established in 1952 as Conjunto Guaguancó Matancero and released their first LP in 1956 through Puchito. Since then, Los Muñequitos have continued to perform and record, becoming one of the most successful and critically acclaimed rumba groups of all time.

==History==

On October 9, 1952 in the barrio of La Marina, city of Matanzas, Cuba, a group of young rumberos stopped off at their local tavern El Gallo after work. While unwinding over drinks, a song by Arsenio Rodríguez came on the bar’s record player. The drummers began accompanying the song by playing on the counter, on glasses and bottles, using whatever items were at hand. Their performance so impressed the other customers, as well as passers-by, that the men received applause when the song and their accompaniment concluded. It was at that moment when one of the men suggested they form a rumba group to perform at local venues. It was agreed and the rumberos walked over to the house of singer and composer Florencio Calle &quot;Catalino&quot; to enlist his help. After hearing the men’s proposition Catalino told them to return the next day to discuss the matter.

At the meeting the following day, Grupo Guaguancó Matancero was formed. The men agreed that the group would perform rumba and each member would be responsible for bringing his own respective instrument. The original members of Guaguancó Matancero were Florencio Calle &quot;Catalino&quot; (director, guagua), Esteban Lantri &quot;Saldiguera&quot; (vocalist), Juan Bosco (vocalist, claves), Hortensio Alfonso &quot;Virulilla&quot; (vocalist, maraca), Gregorio Díaz &quot;Goyo&quot; (tumba or salidor), Pablo Mesa &quot;Papi&quot; (segundo or tres dos) and Angel Pellado &quot;Pelladito&quot; (quinto). Later that year the great batalero (‘batá drummer’) and &quot;quintero&quot; (‘quinto drummer’) Esteban Vega &quot;Chachá&quot; joined the group.

Although the members were all genuine &quot;street&quot; rumberos, they began performing on stage from the group’s inception. Saldiguera and Virulilla who had sung in son septetos (‘septets’), brought that genre’s style of harmony singing to the group. The percussion was of a very high quality, with the drums carrying on &quot;conversations&quot; of unprecedented inventiveness and virtuosity. The drums were tuned much lower back then, sounding like funky bass lines, with the rhythmically elusive singing &quot;floating&quot; on top. Initially, the group only performed guaguancó, but in ensuing years they interpreted yambú, columbia and abakuá as well.

Guaguancó Matancero began playing in the barrios of Simpson and La Marina, but soon they performed throughout the province of Matanzas. In 1953 they were invited to play at various venues in the capital city, Havana. The group also performed live on radio and television and recorded their first 78 rpm phonorecord for Puchito Records (n. 298). The two songs were &quot;Los beodos&quot; (‘The Drunks’) on Side A, and &quot;Los muñequitos&quot; (‘The Newspaper Comic Strip Characters’) on the B side. &quot;Los muñequitos&quot; became such a big hit that wherever the group played, the people would call out &quot;¡Los muñequitos! ¡Los muñequitos!&quot; The popularity of the song eventually led them to change the name of the group to Los Muñequitos de Matanzas.

In 1958 Panart Records released two phonorecords &quot;Guaguancó&quot; v. 1 and v. 2, compiling several 78 sides made earlier by the group as well as songs recorded by the Havana rumba group Papín y sus Rumberos. In 1964 Chachá left and vocalist Frank Osamendi joined. Los Muñequitos disbanded in the early 1960s, but re-formed by the end of the decade. They cemented their position as one of Cuba&#x27;s leading rumba ensembles with songs like &quot;Óyelos de nuevo&quot; and &quot;La chismosa del solar&quot;, released in the early 1970s by EGREM. By the 1980s Los Muñequitos were widely known by rumba aficionados in and outside of Cuba. Los Muñequitos quintero Jesús Alfonso&#x27;s guaguancó &quot;Congo yambumba&quot; (1984) was recorded by Eddie Palmieri (1987), and Grupo Vocal Sampling (1992).

In 1992 the American record company Qbadisc began releasing albums by Los Muñequitos on CD in the United States, followed by a tour of the country for the first time. It was during this time that the group branched out and performed folkloric music and dance besides rumba, such as Lucumí, Palo, abakuá and conga. The music of Los Muñequitos directly reflects the syncretism that exists in Cuba as sacred songs to the orishas often coexist with more secular themes and adaptations of Spanish songs in a single record or performance. In the late summer of 1994 Los Muñequitos joined the Cuban jazz ensemble Irakere on stage at the Banff Centre for the Arts to perform &quot;Xiomara.&quot; In 1997, they released their critically acclaimed &quot;Live in New York&quot; album. Los Muñequitos earned a Grammy Award nomination in 2001. Their latest album, &quot;Maferefún la rumba&quot;, was released in November 2018.

Other past and present members of the group include (in alphabetical order): Iván Alfonso, Freddy Jesús Alfonso Borges, Israel Berriel González, Israel Berriel Jiménez &quot;Toto,&quot; Luis Cancino, Baldomero Ricardo Cané Gómez, Pedrito Currubia, Agustín Díaz Cano, Eddy Espinosa, Victoriano Espinosa &quot;Titi,&quot; Ronald González, Reyniel López González, José Andro Mella, Rafael Navarro Pujada &quot;Niño,&quot; Luis Deyvis Oduardo Ramos, Jaime Oña Ramos, Facundo Pelladito, Ana Pérez Herrera, Yuniscleyvis Ramos, Bárbaro Ramos Aldazábal, Diosdado Enier Ramos Aldazábal &quot;Figurín,&quot; Esther Yamile Ramos Aldazábal, Vivian Ramos Aldazábal, Diosdado Ramos Cruz, Alberto Romero Díaz, Ernesto Torriente &quot;Chambelona,&quot; Leonel Torriente, and Ricardo Yorca &quot;Chacho.&quot;

==Guaguancó innovators==
===Salidor and segundo===
From their very first recordings in 1956, to present, Los Muñequitos have maintained a reputation as innovators of rumba, and of guaguancó in particular. The melodic conversations of the two, lower-pitched congas (salidor and segundo), eventually evolved into an extremely fluid style, that was more an approach than a composite of specific parts. The inventions of Los Muñequitos predates guarapachangeo and similar rumba creations emerging from in and around Havana in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s Los Muñequitos began incorporating break-downs, where the bottom end of the drum melody momentarily dropped out. See: break-down at 3: 28, &quot; La polemica&quot; live in Puerto Cárdenas, Matanzas, 25 April 1987. These breakdowns are similar to the breakdowns heard in the timba music that was emerging at the end of the 1980s, and which continue to this day.

===Quinto===
Los Muñequitos&#x27; style of playing quinto is also renown. They pioneered the style of an alternating tone-slap melody, that inverts with each cycle of clave (written as a single measure here). The following example shows the sparsest form of the alternating melody. The first measure is tone-slap-tone, and the second measure is slap-tone-slap.

The following nine-measure excerpt is from the quinto performance on &quot;La polémica,&quot; composed by Israel Berriel González. The quinto moves between three different modes (A, B, C). The previous quinto example, and the last measure of the following example are both in the basic mode (A), commonly called the &quot;quinto lock&quot;, or &quot;ride&quot; in North America.

<text>Raymond Constantine Fernandez Jr. (May 7, 1956 – March 6, 2004) was an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name Hercules Hernandez, or simply Hercules. Fernandez began his career in 1979, primarily wrestling in Florida and Texas before earning his greatest success by joining the World Wrestling Federation in 1985, where he was a member of The Heenan Family. He later split from the stable and feuded with Heenan and Ted DiBiase, afterwards turning heel in 1990, forming Power and Glory with Paul Roma, where they had a feud with The Rockers. Fernandez was also a featured bodybuilder, appearing in several muscle magazines. He is also known for his appearances in World Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, and New-Japan Pro Wrestling.

== Early life ==
Fernandez was born in New York City on May 7, 1956. After his mother died from cancer when he was aged six, his father relocated the family to Tampa, Florida. Fernandez attended A. P. Leto High School, where he competed in amateur wrestling. He graduated from high school in 1974 and enlisted in the United States Air Force for three years. 

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1979–1983)===

Fernandez was trained to wrestle by Hiro Matsuda. He started wrestling in 1979, mainly performing in Florida and Texas territories as &quot;Hercules&quot; Hernandez. In 1982, he joined the NWA Central States territory (which ran out of Kansas City and promoted shows in Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa). While in the Central States, Hercules teamed up with Dewey Robertson, and the two won the Central States tag team championship on two occasions; they beat Mike George and Mark Romero both times. He also held the Central States Television title for a little over six months, winning it from, and losing it back to, his main rival, Romero. His two other notable feuds in the Central States territory were with Manny Fernandez and Harley Race. His feud with Race garnered Hernandez significant attention in the national wrestling scene, due to Race&#x27;s stature as a former NWA World Champion.

This feud began because Race had an issue with Oliver Humperdink&#x27;s House of Humperdink stable, which Hernandez had become a part of soon after joining the promotion. One match between the two had the stipulation that if Race won, he would get five minutes inside a steel cage with Humperdink. Hercules was caught using brass knuckles and disqualified, which meant that the cage match was on. When the match was about to start, Hernandez ran to ringside, knocked Race out and threw him into the ring with Humperdink. In the end, Race recovered and delivered a piledriver to Humperdink onto a steel chair injuring (kayfabe) Humperdink and causing him to leave the territory. After losing his manager, Hernandez did not stay in the Central States territory for long but instead signed up with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP).

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1983) ===
In January 1983, Fernandez toured Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1983–1984) ===

In JCP, Fernandez was paired up with Jody Hamilton, who had been wrestling as the Masked Assassin; Fernandez became the Masked Assassin 2, a gimmick that had been played by several other wrestlers over the years. The two competed at the first ever Starrcade beating the team of Rufus R. Jones and Bugsy McGraw. Fernandez&#x27;s run as one of the Assassins ended less than a year later, after he was unmasked by Jimmy Valiant.

=== Mid-South Wrestling (1984–1985) ===
After being unmasked, Fernandez moved on to Bill Watts&#x27; Mid-South promotion, where he once again donned a mask. Mr. Wrestling II had recently turned on his tag team partner Magnum T. A. and become a heel. Mr. Wrestling II renamed himself simply &quot;Mr. Wrestling&quot; and got a new protégé, &quot;Mr. Wrestling II&quot;, who was Fernandez under a mask (referred to as &quot;Mr. Wrestling III&quot; in magazines to avoid confusing their readers). Mr. Wrestling II seconded Mr. Wrestling in his feud with Magnum T. A. Later on, Fernandez unmasked and competed once again as &quot;Hercules Hernandez&quot;, and feuded with &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan under the tutelage of Jim Cornette. Hercules soon joined Skandor Akbar&#x27;s stable, Devastation Inc., alongside future WWF co-worker Ted DiBiase. As part of Devastation Inc., Hercules feuded with the Junkyard Dog and Terry Taylor, before leaving for Florida.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1985) ===
In &quot;Championship Wrestling from Florida&quot;, Hercules quickly won the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship from Brian Blair, and then won the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship from Hector Guerrero the following month; this made him a double champion. Some time during July 1985, Fernandez was fired from CWF after a dressing room fight with Wahoo McDaniel and stripped of both titles. After leaving Florida, Fernandez went to World Wrestling Council (WWC), in Puerto Rico before signing with the World Wrestling Federation. Hernandez had a brief stint in Dallas with NWA World Class Championship Wrestling where was managed by Sunshine and had several high profile feuds, most notably again Gino Hernandez.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985–1992) ===

==== Early appearances (1985–1986) ====
Fernandez debuted in the WWF in November 1985, managed by &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie. His first major national exposure came when he competed at WrestleMania 2 in a losing effort against Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat at the Sports Arena in the Los Angeles part of the show. Blassie soon retired, as, in storyline, he sold his stable to Slick and Fernandez soon found himself floundering in the WWF midcard.

==== Heenan Family (1986–1988) ====
In late 1986, however, his contract was &quot;sold&quot; by Slick to fellow heel manager Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan. Soon after, he dropped &quot;Hernandez&quot; from his ringname (though some commentators such as Gorilla Monsoon still occasionally referred to him as Hernandez), as well as the Roman gladiator-style vest and wrist bands he wore during his ring entrance. He began carrying a long steel chain to the ring and re-emerged with a more muscular physique. On November 29, 1986 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VIII&quot;, Hercules received a shot at the WWF Heavyweight Championship, facing champion Hulk Hogan. Although he was able to put Hogan in the &quot;Hercules backbreaker&quot; torture rack, he lost by pinfall in what was arguably the biggest match of his wrestling career.

Also in the fall of 1986, Hercules rekindled a feud with Billy Jack Haynes that went back through every promotion the two were ever in together, including the WWF earlier in 1986. As part of the feud, Hercules started using Haynes&#x27; finishing move, the full nelson submission hold, as his finisher. On an episode of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;, Heenan called out Haynes saying he would like to see him get out of Hercules&#x27; version of the hold. Haynes promptly answered the challenge and was waiting for Hercules to apply the hold when Heenan appeared to have second thoughts. Haynes grew tired of the charade and shoved Heenan. This gave Hercules the opening he needed to clothesline Haynes. Haynes was unable to defend himself and Hercules applied the full nelson. When Haynes began powering out of the hold, Heenan kicked him in the abdomen and Hercules released the hold. This incident set the stage for their match at WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome in front of a reported 93,173 fans. The momentum swung back and forth throughout the contest until Haynes attempted to apply the full nelson; both men tumbled to the floor after Hercules reached the ropes. Haynes applied the full nelson on the floor as both men were counted out. Heenan broke the hold by driving a knee into the back of Haynes, who then turned his attention to Heenan and chased him into the ring, allowing Hercules to blindside him with a shot to the head with his steel chain wrapped around his fist, causing Haynes to bleed profusely (a closeup shot of Haynes on the mat clearly showed him &quot;blading&quot; himself in order to draw blood). The feud culminated some weeks later in a chain match that saw Hercules as the victor.

In the early part of 1988, during an episode of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, Hercules was swinging his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler: the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules&#x27; full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting his shoulder at the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules.

==== Rivalry with Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan (1988–1990) ====
During the fall of 1988, Bobby Heenan sold Hercules&#x27; contract to Ted DiBiase; DiBiase claimed that in Hercules, he had now purchased his own slave. The would-be transaction failed because Hercules resisted the proceedings which angered him. He stated that he was owned by &quot;no man&quot; and instantly turned face to feud with DiBiase. Marking the end of ties for Heenan and Hercules, Bobby Heenan would from now as commentator and in promotions refer to Fernandez as &quot;Herc the Jerk&quot;. Hercules defeated DiBiase&#x27;s bodyguard Virgil in a battle for his &quot;freedom&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XVIII&quot; on November 16 after DiBiase contended that he should not have to dirty his hands to beat his own slave. Hercules and DiBiase were later on opposite teams at the Survivor Series 1988 where DiBiase eliminated Hercules from the contest, but Hercules then distracted DiBiase long enough to be eliminated by WWF World Champion Randy Savage who rolled him up for a pin while he was still gloating about eliminating Hercules.

After the feud with DiBiase ended, Hercules had a series of matches with Haku (who was managed by Heenan). Despite pinning Haku at WrestleMania V, he did not become the &quot;King&quot; of the WWF. Hercules&#x27; career stalled following his feud with Haku. He was mainly used to help push the latest heels such as The Earthquake, who squashed him at WrestleMania VI, and Curt Hennig.

==== Power and Glory (1990–1991) ====

In the summer of 1990, Hercules turned heel alongside Paul Roma and the two formed Power and Glory, managed by Slick. They had a high-profile feud with The Rockers, defeating them at SummerSlam in Philadelphia and challenged WWF World Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation. At WrestleMania VII, they lost to The Legion of Doom in less than a minute.

==== Final appearances (1991–1992) ====
After SummerSlam 1991, Roma left the WWF. Hercules spent the rest of his time in the WWF jobbing again, losing to wrestlers such as the Bushwackers, Jim Neidhart, the Big Boss Man and Sid Justice, and Intercontinental champion Bret Hart. Hercules lasted nearly forty minutes in the 1991 Royal Rumble; in 1992, he lasted less than a minute. His last televised WWF match was against Sid Justice at Madison Square Garden where he was squashed in under a minute. A clearly frustrated and fed up Hercules took a Powerbomb from Justice followed by a three count before no-selling the move by simply getting up unhurt and heading for the locker room.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992) ===
After being with the WWF for seven years, Fernandez signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He once again adopted a masked persona, this time as Super Invader, a supposed oriental assassin under the management of former rival Harley Race. As Super Invader, he beat Todd Champion at WrestleWar 1992 and beat Marcus Bagwell in a dark match before the Great American Bash 1992. The highlight of his run as Super Invader was his appearance at Clash of the Champions XX teaming with Rick Rude, Jake Roberts, and Big Van Vader in an elimination tag team match against Sting, Nikita Koloff, and The Steiner Brothers. Although Sting eliminated him early, Super Invader&#x27;s team won the match. By the end of 1992, Fernandez had left WCW.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1993–1994) ===

In March 1993, Fernandez debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling where he appeared as &quot;Hercules Hernandez&quot; once more, mainly teaming with fellow powerhouse wrestler Scott Norton to form the Jurassic Powers. They won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior) in August 1993 and held it for about four months before losing it back to the Hell Raisers at NJPW&#x27;s January 4 Dome Show. While holding the title, the Jurassic Powers successfully defended against teams such as The Japanese Jollyjacks (Takayuki Iizuka and Akira Nogami), Masa Saito and Manabu Nakanishi, and the Barbarian and Haku. The team also had a series of matches with the Steiner Brothers and made it to the finals of the 1993 Super Grade Tag League where they lost to Keiji Mutoh and Hiroshi Hase.

=== Late career (1993–1999) ===
In 1993, Hercules wrestled for International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW) and in 1994, he wrestled in the American Wrestling Federation (AWF) promotion taking part in the tournament to crown the first AWF champion. In 1999, Ray Fernandez retired from wrestling after working for various independent promotions across the world.

== Personal life ==
Fernandez met his high school sweetheart Debbie in 1974. They married in 1976 and had seven children, Nichole, Jeremy, Jaclyn, Amanda, Taylor, Katelyn, and Keith.

== Death ==
Fernandez died in his sleep in his home on March 6, 2004. The cause of death was attributed to heart disease according to his wife. He was buried with military honors at Florida National Cemetery in Bushnell, Florida.

<doc id="1156120" wikidata="Q732642" url="?curid=1156120" title="Rick Rude">
<text>Richard Erwin Rood (December 7, 1958 – April 20, 1999), better known by his ring name &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude, was an American professional wrestler who performed for many promotions, including World Wrestling Federation (WWF), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).

Rude wrestled from 1982 until his 1994 retirement due to injury, with a final match following in 1997. Among other accolades, he was a four-time world champion, a three-time WCW International World Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WCWA World Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, and a one-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion. Rude also challenged for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on pay-per-view cards, competing for the former in the main event of SummerSlam in 1990. Following his retirement, Rude managed multiple wrestlers.

In late 1997, Rude founded the D-Generation X stable alongside Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Chyna. On November 17 of that year, in the midst of the Monday Night War, he became the only person to appear on the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; and WCW&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; programs on the same night, as the former was pre-recorded and Rude had left for WCW in the interim. He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017.

== Early life ==
Rude was born in St. Peter, Minnesota to Richard Clyde Rood and Sally Jean Thompson. He attended Robbinsdale High School in Robbinsdale, Minnesota with Tom Zenk, Brady Boone, Nikita Koloff, Curt Hennig, John Nord, and Barry Darsow, all of whom later became professional wrestlers. He was especially close with his childhood friend Curt Hennig.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1982–1984) ===

After graduating from Anoka-Ramsey Community College with a degree in physical education, Rude worked as a bouncer for a short period and later did a small stint as an arm wrestler. He would first become known to the world of professional wrestling at that time. Rude trained as a wrestler under Eddie Sharkey, the same trainer responsible for training other wrestling stars like Bob Backlund, The Road Warriors, Sean Waltman, Austin Aries, and Erick Rowan. He began wrestling in 1982 as Ricky Rood, a babyface jobber. Rude lost his TV debut against Jos LeDuc on the November 6, 1982 episode of Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling. He started with Vancouver&#x27;s before moving on to compete for Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and later the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). Rude debuted on the May 28, 1983 episode of &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot;, defeating Pat Rose with a dropkick. Gordon Solie interviewed Rude the following week, with Rude discussing transitioning from arm wrestling to pro wrestling and dropping weight to increase speed. He returned to Memphis in 1984, this time as &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude, an overconfident, arrogant heel managed by Jimmy Hart. Rude feuded with Jerry Lawler and later his former partner, King Kong Bundy. He later debuted in WCCW in a match against Kamala that he lost, and then went on to (NWA) affiliate Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) where he and a variety of tag team partners feuded with The Road Warriors.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1984–1985) ===

Rude was hired by Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) in December 1984, where he was managed by Percy Pringle. He defeated Pez Whatley for the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship on January 16, 1985, and lost it to Brian Blair on April 10, 1985. He captured the championship again on July 20, 1985, when he defeated Mike Graham in the finals of a Southern title tournament. He held the belt until October 2 of that year when he dropped it to Wahoo McDaniel, who was booking Florida during this time. While teaming with Jesse Barr, he won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship on April 16, 1985, and feuded with Billy Jack Haynes and Wahoo McDaniel over the belts, losing the straps to McDaniel and Haynes on July 9, 1985.

=== World Class Championship Wrestling (1985–1986) ===

Debuting on October 18, 1985, Rude jumped to World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) along with Pringle, where he feuded with Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams. During his time in WCCW, Rude captured the NWA American Heavyweight Championship on November 4, 1985. However, WCCW withdrew from the NWA on February 20, 1986, and changed its name to the World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA). The NWA American Championship was renamed the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship while Rude was still holding the title. As a result, Rude became the promotion&#x27;s first world champion. After losing the title to Chris Adams in July 1986, he fired Pringle and briefly replaced him with his sister, Raven. He formed a short-lived tag team with The Dingo Warrior, but the Warrior turned on him and became a face.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1986–1987) ===
In September 1986, Rude returned to JCP and joined Manny Fernandez and his manager Paul Jones in their rivalry with Wahoo McDaniel. Rude and Fernandez, known collectively as the &quot;Awesome Twosome&quot;, won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on December 6, 1986, from The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express, and they began a feud that ended only when Rude left the promotion for the World Wrestling Federation in April 1987. To explain the sudden departure, Jim Crockett, Jr. aired a pre-taped non-title match where the Express defeated Rude and Fernandez and claimed that Rude had been injured as a result.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1987−1990)===

==== Debut and feuds with Paul Orndorff and Jake Roberts (1987–1988) ====
Rude made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut on &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot; on July 15, 1987, as the newest addition to the Bobby Heenan Family. His first major feud in the WWF was with Heenan&#x27;s former muscle bound charge &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff (whom Heenan had dropped after Rude joined the Family), their feud culminated in Rude defeating Orndorff on November 24, at Madison Square Garden. He would kickstart 1988 by challenging Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on January 9, at the Boston Garden but failed to win the title before starting one of his most famous feuds with Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts. Rude had a routine where, before the match, he would make a show of removing his robe (likely inspired by Austin Idol&#x27;s disrobing routine) while insulting the males in the crowd (usually calling them &quot;fat, out-of-shape sweathogs&quot;) from their hometowns and, after his victories, he would kiss a woman whom Heenan selected from the audience. One of Rude&#x27;s trademarks was his specially airbrushed tights that he wore during matches. In the Roberts angle, Rude tried to get Roberts&#x27; real-life wife, Cheryl, to participate (though not knowing when Heenan chose her that she was in fact Roberts&#x27; wife). After Mrs. Roberts rejected him and revealed who she was there to see, Rude became angry (after she slapped him and according to Jake, busting his eardrum), grabbed her wrist, and berated her on the microphone when Roberts ran from the dressing room to make the save. To retaliate a few days later, Rude came to the ring with a likeness of Cheryl stenciled on the front of his tights. A furious Roberts charged the ring and stripped Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave him naked (as indicated by black-spot censoring Rude&#x27;s genital area), although the live audience saw him actually stripped to a g-string.

Through mid-1988 Rude continued to wear a second pair of tights under the one he wore to the ring, including during his match against the Junkyard Dog at the inaugural SummerSlam. During the match Rude had the JYD on his back and had climbed to the top turnbuckle. While up there he pulled down his tights to reveal a second with Cheryl Roberts printed on them. After hitting the Dog with a flying fist, he was attacked by Roberts who had seen the action from the dressing room. Roberts attack on Rude caused the JYD to be disqualified, giving Rude the win. Rude lost to Roberts in a Rude Awakening vs. DDT match on October 24, at Madison Square Garden. Rude&#x27;s feud with Roberts came to its conclusion when Roberts pinned Rude following a DDT during the 1988 Survivor Series.

==== Intercontinental Champion and departure (1989–1990) ====
Rude&#x27;s next big feud was with The Ultimate Warrior and began in January at the 1989 Royal Rumble pay-per-view in a &quot;Super Posedown&quot; that ended with Rude attacking Warrior with a metal pose bar. With help from Heenan, Rude won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship from The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania V, before dropping it back to Warrior at SummerSlam that same year, due in large part to interference from &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper. Rude then feuded with Piper which led to a conflict between their respective teams at the 1989 Survivor Series in which both men brawled to a double count-out. Rude would go on to have many matches with Piper including inside a steel cage on December 28, at Madison Square Garden losing the majority of them, before having a brief program against Jimmy Snuka getting a win over him at WrestleMania VI. Rude resumed his conflict with The Ultimate Warrior in the summer of 1990 after Warrior had won the WWF Championship. Rude began rigorous training in preparation for the Warrior, and took a more serious approach by neglecting women and cutting his hair short (a style he would maintain for the rest of his career). The feud culminated in a steel cage at SummerSlam 1990, wherein Rude was defeated by the Warrior. Next, he was scheduled to feud with Big Boss Man, which had its start when Rude&#x27;s manager Bobby Heenan started to make degrading comments about Boss Man&#x27;s mother. Rude would later backup the statements and call out the Boss Man. Rude was scheduled to be a part of a team called the Natural Disasters at the Survivor Series, consisting of Earthquake, Dino Bravo, and The Barbarian against Hulk Hogan and Boss Man&#x27;s team, but was replaced by Haku after being suspended indefinitely by Jack Tunney. Tunney explained that Rude&#x27;s comments towards the Boss Man were the reason for his suspension and that his manager Bobby Heenan was obligated to wrestle the Boss Man in his place. In reality, Rude had a dispute with WWF owner Vince McMahon that led to him leaving the company.

=== Freelance (1991) ===
After leaving the WWF, Rude attempted to join Herb Abrams&#x27; UWF. Still under contract with the WWF, his former company sent a cease and desist order that prevented Rude from appearing on UWF television. He would not wrestle again until May 18, 1991, when he appeared at the TWA Spring Spectacular II event held by the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance in Philadelphia, PA. He faced Paul Orndorff and lost by disqualification. Two months later he joined All Japan Pro Wrestling for their Summer Action Series 1991, making his initial appearance on July 6, 1991, at a show in Yokosuka, Japan. In his first match on the tour, he teamed with Johnny Ace to defeat Billy Black and Joel Deaton. In singles matches Rude was undefeated, beating Isamu Teranishi and Akira Taue. His final appearance came on July 19, where he teamed with Johnny Ace in a losing effort to Dan Spivey and Stan Hansen. Rude also appeared in International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW), where he had confrontations with The Honky Tonk Man.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1991−1994)===

==== The Dangerous Alliance and United States Heavyweight Champion (1991–1993) ====

After spending a year wrestling on select shows on the independent circuit, as well as a July 1991 tour for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), Rude returned to WCW, which had originally been JCP prior to being sold to Ted Turner in late 1988; he returned under a mask as The WCW Phantom at Halloween Havoc on October 27, 1991, unmasking himself later that night. He led The Dangerous Alliance, consisting of himself, Paul E. Dangerously, Madusa, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton, Larry Zbyszko, and &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin. On November 19, 1991, Rude defeated Sting for the United States Heavyweight Championship and engaged in a number of high-profile feuds, including one with Ricky Steamboat. At one point during their feud, Steamboat suffered a kayfabe broken nose in a gang attack.

In 1992, Rude and Madusa left The Dangerous Alliance and feuded with Nikita Koloff. Rude challenged reigning World Heavyweight Champion Ron Simmons on several occasions but failed to win the title. In December 1992, Rude suffered a legitimate neck injury and was forced to forfeit the United States Championship, thus ending his reign of nearly 14 months, a reign that still stands today as the second longest reign in the almost 40-year history of the title. Rude returned alone in April 1993 and tried to reclaim the title from Dustin Rhodes, who had won it while he was injured. The title was eventually held up after several controversial finishes to matches between the two. After a 30-minute Iron Man Match ended in a 1–1 draw at Beach Blast on July 18, a best-of-three series was set between the two on &quot;Saturday Night&quot;; Rude won the first match on August 28, but lost to Rhodes twice on September 4 and 11, losing his chance at regaining the United States Heavyweight Championship.

==== International World Heavyweight Champion and retirement (1993–1994) ====
Rude switched his sights to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, making his intentions clear on August 28, 1993, when he was the guest on then-champion Ric Flair&#x27;s &quot;A Flair For the Gold&quot; talk segment. Rude defeated Flair for the title in September 1993 at Fall Brawl. As WCW had recently withdrawn from the NWA, WCW lost the rights to continue using the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. WCW created their own championship, dubbing it the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, which Rude lost to Hiroshi Hase on March 16, 1994, in Tokyo, Japan. Rude regained the title just eight days later in Kyoto, Japan. After dropping the title to Sting on April 17 at Spring Stampede, Rude pinned Sting on May 1 at Wrestling Dontaku in Fukuoka to become a three-time champion. Rude, however, injured his back during the match when, upon receiving a suicide dive at ringside, he landed on the corner of the raised platform surrounding the ring; unable to wrestle, he was stripped of the title (with the storyline excuse that he was found to have used the title belt as a weapon in the course of the match). Rude retired shortly thereafter.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997) ===

Rude collected on a Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance policy and did not appear in wrestling again until January 1997, when he joined Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as a masked man. Rude debuted at House Party, declaring that his New Year&#x27;s resolution was to &quot;fuck with the Franchise&quot; (Shane Douglas). Rude went on to repeatedly harass Douglas, at one point spanking Douglas&#x27; valet Francine during Crossing the Line Again. He eventually unmasked and became a color commentator before later aligning himself, for a short time, with Douglas and his Triple Threat stable. In the main event of ECW Heat Wave 1997, Rude made a one-off return to the ring in a six-man tag team match, where he partnered with ECW mainstays Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman to face Jerry Lawler and ECW stars Rob Van Dam and Sabu, only to betray Dreamer and The Sandman. During the ECW versus USWA/WWF inter-company competition, Rude helped Lawler win matches against Dreamer and The Sandman.

=== Return to the WWF (1997) ===

On August 11, 1997, Rude returned to the WWF as the &quot;insurance policy&quot; of the group that would become known as D-Generation X (DX) (Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Chyna). The D-Generation X name was first used on October 13, 1997. As a member of DX, Rude never wrestled, but stayed ringside during the group&#x27;s matches. A few days after the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series, Rude once again left the WWF. According to Bret Hart, Rude stayed in the locker room during Bret&#x27;s confrontation with Vince McMahon after the match in Montreal, and later called Eric Bischoff, informing Bischoff that what had happened was in fact real. Rude was not signed to a full-time contract with the WWF, and was instead performing on a &quot;pay-per-appearance&quot; basis. Rude was able to negotiate a deal with Bischoff and WCW, in large part due to his anger over the Montreal Screwjob.

=== Return to WCW (1997–1999) ===

Rude appeared on both the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Raw Is War&quot; and WCW&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; in the same night on November 17, 1997. A mustached Rude appeared on &quot;Nitro&quot;, which was live, and proceeded to criticize Vince McMahon, Shawn Michaels, DX, and the WWF, calling the company the &quot;Titanic&quot; (a reference to Titan Sports, as WWF&#x27;s parent company was then known, as the &quot;sinking ship&quot;). An hour later on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; (which had been taped six days earlier), Rude then appeared with the full beard he had been sporting during his last few weeks in the WWF. Rude also appeared on ECW&#x27;s &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; during that weekend (November 14–16 as the show was syndicated differently depending on the market). Rude was still making ECW appearances while he was in D-Generation X, as the WWF and ECW often co-operated in terms of talent.

In WCW, Rude became a member of the New World Order (nWo), managing his friend Curt Hennig. Thus, Rude became the first wrestler to be part of both DX and nWo. When the nWo split, Hennig and Rude initially sided with the nWo Wolfpac during May 1998. But their time with the &quot;Red &amp; Black&quot; was very brief. At The Great American Bash, they turned on fellow Wolfpac member Konnan by attacking him after he lost to the then-undefeated Goldberg, resulting in Hennig and Rude both joining nWo Hollywood instead. By late 1998, both Rude and Hennig were off WCW television due to injuries. Hennig had an ongoing leg injury that year, and Rude was thought to have had testicular cancer which later turned out to be a spermatocele. Hennig returned to the nWo from his injury at Starrcade without Rude, who was still unable to appear and was not included in the nWo reunion that happened during January 1999. Rude officially left WCW in April 1999, with his last appearance coming on the April 5, 1999 edition of WCW Monday Nitro Backstage Blast.

== Personal life==
In 1976, Rood married his love interest, Cheryl Holler. The couple later divorced in 1982. Rood married his second wife Michelle in 1988, and the couple remained together until his death in 1999. They had three children together, Richard Jr., Merissa, and Colton. His younger son, Colton, died on September 3, 2016, in a motorcycle accident in Rome, Georgia, at the age of 19.

Bret Hart has stated that in spite of his womanizing, &quot;Ravishing One&quot; persona, Rude was a devoted family man who never took his wedding ring off even during matches, but instead covered it up with tape.

== Death ==
Rude was found unconscious by his wife and died on the morning of April 20, 1999, at the age of 40 when he suffered from heart failure. An autopsy report showed he died from an overdose of &quot;mixed medications&quot;. At the time of his death, Rude was in training for a return to the ring. The effects of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, a narcolepsy prevention drug, may have contributed to his death.

== Legacy ==
On March 6, 2017, it was announced that Rick Rude would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat inducted Rude. Michelle, Merissa, and Richard Jr. accepted on his behalf.

<text>Stanley Toshi Matsunaka (born November 12, 1953) is a former Democratic member of the Colorado State Senate, serving from 1995 to 2003. He served as President of the Senate for two years. In both the 2002 and 2004 congressional elections, Matsunaka lost to Republican Marilyn Musgrave for Colorado&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

==Early life and education==
Matsunaka was born in Akron, Colorado, on November 12, 1953, to Mary and Harry Matsunaka. He graduated from Fort Morgan High School in 1971 then received a Bachelors of Science in biological sciences from Colorado State University in 1975 and a Juris Doctor from the University of San Diego in 1979.

==Political career==
In 2002, Matsunaka ran against fellow state senator Musgrave for the open seat in the 4th District, which includes the cities of Greeley, Loveland, Longmont, and Fort Collins, as well much of the Colorado Eastern Plains; he lost to Musgrave 42%-55%.

In 2004, he again challenged Musgrave, now the incumbent, who had attracted controversy in the district for her sponsorship of the Federal Marriage Amendment. In addition to his accusation that Musgrave is a &quot;one trick pony,&quot; Matsunaka also claimed that Musgrave had poor constituent services and did not give enough attention to the district&#x27;s needs. This time, the election was far closer and was not decided until the last returns came in. Musgrave won by six points (51-45%) — the closest margin in the district since 1974. Matsunaka won two of the three biggest counties in the district — Larimer County (including Loveland and Fort Collins) and the district&#x27;s share of Boulder County (including Longmont). However, Musgrave soundly defeated him in Weld County (including Greeley); he would have unseated Musgrave had he won there.

Despite the surprisingly close 2004 results, Matsunaka ruled out another run.

Now an attorney in private practice in Loveland, Matsunaka was an advisor to Ed Perlmutter&#x27;s successful 2006 campaign for Colorado&#x27;s 7th congressional district. He is married with three grown children, Melissa, Brian, and Kristi.

<text>Cambodian New Year (or Khmer New Year; ), also known as Choul Chnam Thmey (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ; ), Moha Sangkran (, UNGEGN: , ALA-LC: ; ) or Sangkran, is the traditional celebration of the solar new year in Cambodia. A three-day public holiday in the country, the observance begins on New Year&#x27;s Day, which usually falls on 13 April or 14 April, which is the end of the harvesting season, when farmers enjoy the fruits of their labor before the rainy season begins. Khmers living abroad may choose to celebrate during a weekend rather than just specifically 13 April through 16 April. The Khmer New Year coincides with the traditional solar new year in several parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos and Thailand.

==The three days of the new year==

===&quot;Moha Sangkrant&quot;===
&quot;Moha Sangkrant&quot; (, ) or &quot;Sangkrant&quot;, derived from Sanskrit , is the name of the first day of the new year celebration. It is the end of the year and the beginning of a new one. People dress up and light candles and burn incense sticks at shrines, where the members of each family pay homage to offer thanks for the Buddha&#x27;s teachings by bowing, kneeling and prostrating themselves three times in front of his image. For good luck people wash their face with holy water in the morning, their chests at noon, and their feet in the evening before they go to bed.

===&quot;Veareak Vanabat&quot;===
&quot;Veareak Vanabat&quot; (, ) is the name of the second day of the new year celebration. People contribute charity to the less fortunate by helping the poor, servants, homeless, and low-income families. Families attend a dedication ceremony to their ancestors at monasteries.
===&quot;Veareak Laeung Sak&quot;===
&quot;Veareak Laeung Sak&quot; (, ) in Khmer is the name of the third day of the new year celebration. Buddhists wash the Buddha statues and their elders with perfumed water. Bathing images of Buddha is a symbolic practice to wash bad actions away, like cleaning dirt from household items with water. It is also thought to be a kind deed that will bring longevity, good luck, happiness and prosperity in life. By washing their grandparents and parents, the children can obtain from them best wishes and good pieces of advice to live the life for the rest of the year.

== New Year&#x27;s customs ==

In temples, people erect a sand hillock on temple grounds. They mound up a big pointed hill of sand or dome in the center which represents Valuka Chaitya, the stupa at Tavatimsa where the Buddha&#x27;s hair and diadem are buried. The big stupa is surrounded by four small ones, which represent the stupas of the Buddha&#x27;s favorite disciples: Sariputta, Moggallana, Ananda, and Maha Kassapa. There is another tradition called (, ) : pouring water or liquid plaster (a mixture of water with some chalk powder) on elder relative, or people (mostly the younger generation is responsible for pouring the water).

The Khmer New Year is also a time to prepare special dishes. One of these is a &quot;kralan&quot; (, ): a cake made from steamed rice mixed with beans or peas, grated coconut and coconut milk. The mixture is stuffed inside a bamboo stick and slowly roasted.

== Traditional games ==

Cambodia is home to a variety of traditional games (, ) played to transform the dull days into memorable occasions. These games are similar to those played in Manipur, a north-eastern state in India. Throughout the Khmer New Year, street corners often are crowded with friends and families enjoying a break from routine, filling their free time with dancing and games. Typically, Khmer games help maintain one&#x27;s mental and physical dexterity.
 (, ) is a game played especially on the first nightfall of the Khmer New Year by two groups of boys and girls. Ten or 20 people comprise each group, standing in two rows opposite each other. One group throws the to the other group. When it is caught, it will be rapidly thrown back to the first group. If someone is hit by the , the whole group must dance to get the back while the other group sings to the dance.
 (, ) is a game played by imitating a hen as she protects her chicks from a crow. Adults typically play this game on the night of the first New Year&#x27;s Day. Participants usually appoint a strong player to play the hen who protects &quot;her&quot; chicks, while another person is picked to be the &quot;crow&quot;. While both sides sing a song of bargaining, the crow tries to catch as many chicks as possible as they hide behind the hen.

 (, ) is the simple style consists of just throwing the Angkunhs to hit the target Angkunhs. The extended style adds five more stages in addition to the throwing stage. Both styles end with a penalty called Jours-activity that the winning team members get to perform on the losing team members. The Jours-activity is performed by using the Angkunghs the hit the knees of the losing team.
 (, )⁣ is a game played by a group of children sitting in a circle. Someone holding a &quot;kanseng&quot; (Cambodian towel) that is twisted into a round shape walks around the circle while singing a song. The person walking secretly tries to place the &quot;kanseng&quot; behind one of the children. If that chosen child realizes what is happening, he or she must pick up the &quot;kanseng&quot; and beat the person sitting next to him or her.
 (, ) is a game played by two children in rural or urban areas during their leisure time. Ten holes are dug in the shape of an oval into a board in the ground. The game is played with 42 small beads, stones or fruit seeds. Before starting the game, five beads are put into each of the two holes located at the tip of the board. Four beads are placed in each of the remaining eight holes. The first player takes all the beads from any hole and drops them one by one in the other holes. He or she must repeat this process until they have dropped the last bead into a hole that lies besides any empty one. Then they must take all the beads in the hole that follows the empty one. At this point, the second player may have his turn. The game ends when all the holes are empty. The player with the greatest number of beads wins the game. It is possibly similar to congkak.

Klah Klok is a popular dice game from Cambodia. Players place bets on which pictures they think will appear on three dice with pictures on each side. The dice are then rolled into a bowl, and players win if one or more of their chosen pictures appear. There are six pictures to choose from and these are the stag (sometimes replaced with a tiger), gourd water bottle, rooster, fish, crab, and prawn. If more than one of their chosen pictures appears on the dice, their winnings are multiplied.

== Angkor Sangkrant ==

 (, ) is a Khmer New Year event organized by the Union of Youth Federations of Cambodia (UYFC) in Siem Reap from 14–16 April. The cultural event is an opportunity for all Cambodians to unite, and for foreign friends to receive unforgettable and exquisite experiences during Khmer New Year in Cambodia.

<doc id="1156138" wikidata="Q4124355" url="?curid=1156138" title="Wolf's Head Society">
<text>Wolf&#x27;s Head Society is a senior secret society at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The society is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; societies at Yale, along with Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key. Active undergraduate membership is elected annually with sixteen Yale University students, typically rising seniors. Honorary members are elected.

The current delegation spends its year together answerable to an alumni association. Some past members have gained prominence in athletics, business, the fine and literary arts, higher education, journalism, and politics.

==History==
Fifteen rising seniors from the Yale Class of 1884, with help from members of the Yale Class of 1883 who were considered publicly possible taps for the older societies, abetted the creation of The Third Society. The society changed its name to Wolf&#x27;s Head five years later.

The effort was aided by more than 300 Yale College alumni and a few Yale Law School faculty, in part to counter the dominance of the Skull and Bones Society in undergraduate and university affairs.

The founding defeated the last attempt by the administration or the student body to abolish secret or senior societies at Yale. The tradition continued of creating and sustaining a society if enough potential rising seniors thought they had been overlooked: Bones was established in 1832 after a dispute over selections for Phi Beta Kappa awards; Scroll and Key Society, the second society at Yale, was established in 1841 after a dispute over elections to Bones.

The Third Society&#x27;s founding was motivated in part by sentiment among some young men that they deserved insider status. &quot;[A] certain limited number were firmly convinced that there had been an appalling miscarriage of justice in their individual omission from the category of the elect,&quot; some founders agreed.

==Antecedents==
Before the founding in 1780 at Yale of the &quot;Connecticut Alpha chapter&quot; of Phi Beta Kappa, the second chapter established after that society&#x27;s founding in 1776 (which still practices a secret handshake among members), Yale College students established and joined literary societies. By the 1830s, the campus literary societies Linonia, Brothers in Unity, and Calliopean had lost stature. Calliopean folded in 1853, and the others shut down after the American Civil War. Calliopean, Linonia, and Brothers in Unity existed respectively: 1819–1853, 1768–1878, and 1735–1868.

From the mid-1840s until 1883, several societies were started, but each failed to sustain the interest of liberal arts students at Yale College, broadly known as the Academical Department. Star and Dart, Sword and Crown, Tea-Kettle, Spade and Grave, and E.T.L. disbanded.

Phi Beta Kappa was inactive at Yale from 1871 to 1884, coinciding in part with a national reorganization of the society. In the 1820s, Anti-Masonic agitation sweeping across the United States prompted PBK to examine the role of secrecy in its proceedings. Associated with PBK&#x27;s national reorganization in 1881, secrecy disappeared as a signature among all chapters, quelling rivalry with collegiate fraternities, clubs and societies. Hence, secrecy was soon shelved at the Yale chapter. PBK exists today, without any secrecy, as an academic honor society.

Beginning in the 1850s, the Yale undergraduate student body grew more diverse. The college was becoming an institution of national rather than regional importance. Students who hailed from environs beyond New England or who were not Congregationalist or Presbyterian entered the college in large numbers.

The faculty and administration were dominated by alumni of Bones, numbering four out of five faculty members between 1865 and 1916. Bones alumni were university secretaries from 1869 to 1921. Bones alumni were university treasurers for forty-three of the forty-eight years between 1862 - 1910. Five of the first six Yale Corporation elected Alumni Fellows were members of Bones.

Dissatisfaction grew: In 1873, &quot;The Iconoclast&quot;, a student paper published once, , advocated for the abolition of the society system. It opined: &quot;Out of every class Skull and Bones takes its men...They have obtained control of Yale. Its business is performed by them. Money paid to the college must pass into their hands, and be subject to their will...It is Yale College against Skull and Bones!! We ask all men, as a question of right, which should be allowed to live?&quot; The Yale Daily News first appeared on . A memoir of the first college daily&#x27;s birth records its first year strategy to &quot;rag&quot; the societies.

The Class of 1884 unanimously agreed to support a new revolt against the society system by issuing a vote of no confidence to coincide with their graduation. There was a widespread understanding that the existing society system was irredeemable and likely to be abolished.

A spirited defense of the society system appeared in the issue of &quot;The New Englander&quot;, written and published by members of Scroll and Key. Several periodicals reported regularly on the situation.

==Establishment==
The initial delegation, including ten Class Day officers from the Class of 1884 and led by Edwin Albert Merritt, met in secret during their senior year with the aid of members of the Class of 1883 who were &quot;eager to start a society provided the evil features of the old societies would be eliminated. [The graduating and rising seniors] were unanimous on this point.&quot; Included among the supporters from the Class of 1883 were members touted as sure selections to Bones or Keys by the publishers of the &quot;Horoscope&quot;, an undergraduate publication that provided feature material on the most likely taps. The pro-society seniors won the Class Day vote, 67 - 50.

The new society was conceived on or about June 5, 1883. Among undergraduates the fledgling group was known as the &quot;Fox and Grapes&quot; for the Aesopian fable of jealousy.

The two older societies suffered by comparison with Wolf&#x27;s Head. &quot;The New Haven Register&quot; reported in 1886: &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Head is not as far out of the world, in respect to its public doings, as are [Bones and Keys]. There is a sufficient veil of secrecy drawn around its mechanism, however, to class it with the secret societies, and this gives it a stability and respectability in Yale College circles that it might not have otherwise...&quot; The society was managed similarly to finals clubs associated with the Sheffield Scientific School; however, it soon took on almost all aspects of the older societies.

==Early stature==
The Third Society sat at the apex of a social pyramid bricked by junior societies (sophomore societies were abolished in 1875, freshman societies in 1880), campus organizations, athletic teams, clubs, and fraternities.

In 1888, the society changed its name to Wolf&#x27;s Head Society, consonant with the approval among undergraduates of the society&#x27;s pin, a stylized wolf&#x27;s head on an inverted ankh, an Egyptian hieroglyphic known as the Egyptian Cross or &quot;the key of life&quot;. The earliest undergraduate members allowed fellow schoolmates to handle the pin, a specific refutation of the pin displayed by the older societies. Eternal life is symbolized rather than death or erudition. A Roman fasces had been considered as a design element for the pin.

==Point of view==
Many pioneering and subsequent members mocked as &quot;poppycock&quot; (from the Dutch for &quot;soft excrement&quot;) the seemingly Masonic-inspired rituals and atmosphere associated with Skull and Bones. The sentiment was widespread in the Yale community, particularly among undergraduates. In their &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; prank, Wolf&#x27;s Head members persuaded the thespian pirate king to display the numbers 322 (part of the emblem of Skull and Bones) below a skull and crossbones at a local theatre. In another example, Yale President A. Whitney Griswold&#x27;s deprecated the rituals as &quot;bonesy bullshit&quot; and &quot;Dink Stover crap&quot; coloring undergraduate life.

Wolf&#x27;s Head did maintain many traditional practices, such as the Thursday and Sunday meetings, which were common among its peers. Paul Moore, Jr., long-time Senior Fellow and successor trustee (1964 - 1990) for the Yale Corporation and long-tenured bishop in the Episcopal Church (United States), recalled the night before he first encountered combat in World War II: &quot;I spent the evening on board ship being quizzed by [a friend from Harvard] about what went on in Wolf&#x27;s Head. He could not believe I would hold back such irrelevant secrets the night before I faced possible death.&quot;

== Symbols ==
The society&#x27;s badge consists of a wolf&#x27;s head on top of a ankh, in gold.

== Tomb ==

===Old Hall===

The original tomb, or Old Hall, was erected within months of the founding. The older academic department societies met originally for decades in rented quarters near campus. Skull and Bones opened its tomb in 1856, more than two decades after its founding. Scroll and Key did likewise; it opened its tomb in 1869 more than two decades after the society&#x27;s founding.

The former domicile is located at 77 Prospect Street, across the street from the Grove Street Cemetery, was a Richardsonian Romanesque building commissioned for the Phelps Trust Association and designed by the architectural firm McKim, Mead and White. It was completed in 1884. It was purchased by the university in 1924, rented to Chi Psi fraternity (1924–29), Book and Bond (defunct society) (1934–35), and Vernon Hall (now Myth and Sword) (1944–54). It currently houses the Yale Institution for Social and Policy Studies.

A building with narrow windows, the domicile was noted as &quot;the most modern and handsomest&quot; of same purpose structures by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1903. The building was erected in 1884 soon after the founding members secured financing.

===New Hall===
Bertram Goodhue, architect, designed the New Hall, c. 1924; it was built posthumously. Goodhue was a protege of James Renwick Jr., architect of the first St. Anthony Hall chapter house in New York City.

The tomb has stone walls and wrought iron fencing and is central to the largest secret society compound on campus. The compound commands the most prominent location on campus beyond Harkness Tower, the very icon of Yale, and the Memorial Quadrangle.

The domicile opened in the mid-1920s and sits fronted by York Street surrounded by the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; Briton Hadden Memorial building, and the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University. The original School of Drama and Theatre as well as the Briton Hadden Memorial Building, were gifts to Yale from Edward Harkness.

==Membership==
The society has been reputed to tap the gregarious &quot;prep school type&quot;. Past members were associated intimately with the: coeducation of Yale College, establishment of the Yale residential college system and the Harvard house system, founding of the Elizabethan Club, and founding of the Yale Political Union.

This was Yale&#x27;s last all-male society. Women have been tapped since the spring of 1992.

Edward John Phelps, Envoy to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, accepted the offer in 1885 to be namesake to the Wolf&#x27;s Head alumni association. The Phelps Association, as of January 2016, holds in trust nearly seven million dollars, second among Yale societies or clubs.

Yale societies contrast sharply with Harvard finals clubs on membership criteria. Contributions to undergraduate life has been historically among the criteria for membership in Yale societies. Finals clubs overlook that quality among prospective members.

<text>An erygmascope is a late 19th-century electric lighting apparatus designed for the examination of the strata of earth traversed by boring apparatus.

It consisted of a very powerful incandescent lamp enclosed in a metallic cylinder. One of the two semi-cylindrical sides constitutes the reflector, and the other, which is of thick glass, allows the passage of light, which illuminates the strata of earth traversed by the instrument. The base, which is inclined at an angle of 45°, is an elliptical mirror, and the top, of straight section, is open in order to permit the observer standing at the mouth of the well, and provided with a powerful spyglass, to see in the mirror the image of the geological layers or of the structure of crystalline rocks. It somewhat resembles to a kind of inverted semi-periscope aimed to look at earth downwards. The lamp is so mounted that its upwardly emitted rays are intercepted.

The whole apparatus was suspended from a long cable, formed of two conducting wires, which winds around a windlass with metallic journals which are electrically insulated. These journals communicate, through the intermedium of two friction springs, with the conductors on the one hand and, on the other, with the poles of a portable battery. This permits of lowering and raising the apparatus at will, without derangement, and without its being necessary to interrupt the light and the observation.

The erygmascope was described in an 1891 edition of the Scientific American Supplement; To what extent it was put to practical use is unknown.
==Etymology==
The etymology of the term remains enigmatic, but could originate from a Greek word &quot;ήρυγμα&quot; meaning &quot;trench&quot;. However, a shaft should be translated in Greek as &quot;πηγάδι&quot; (pegadi), and a water well as &quot;φρέαρ&quot; (phrear). The origin of the suffix &quot;scope&quot; is classical for an optical instrument: from &quot;σκοπεῖν&quot; (skopein), meaning to look at.

==In art and popular culture==
Sonic and visual artistic collaboration between Tracy Hill, artist, Ralph Hoyte, poet and writer, and Phill Phelps, musician, working in partnership with Lancashire Wildlife Trust and City of Trees. It symbolizes the curiosity of the three artists for looking beyond the surface whilst working on their opus &quot;Stratum&quot;.

<doc id="1156146" wikidata="Q7880715" url="?curid=1156146" title="Ultraviolet light therapy">
<text>[[Ultraviolet]] light therapy or ultraviolet phototherapy is a treatment for psoriasis, atopic skin disorder, vitiligo and other skin diseases. 

There are two main treatments: UVB that is the most common, and PUVA.

There are four UVB types of lamps: Fluorescnt Broad-Band UVB that emit 280-330 nanometer, Fluorescent Narrow-Band that emit 312 nanometer, Excimer that emit 308 nanometer and LED that emit 290-300 nanometer.

PUVA means UVA + psoralen. It consists of irradiation of the skin with the UVA ultraviolet light, from a fluorescent bulb or LED lamps.

Tanning beds are used both in dermatology practices for the treatment of cosmetic skin conditions (such as psoriasis, acne, eczema and vitiligo) and in indoor tanning salons for cosmetic tanning.

Typical treatment regimens involve short exposure to UVB rays 3 to 5 times a week at a hospital or clinic, and repeated sessions may be required before results are noticeable. Almost all of the conditions that respond to UVB light are chronic problems, so continuous treatment is required to keep those problems in check. Home UVB systems are common solutions for those whose conditions respond to treatment. Home systems permit patients to treat themselves every other day (the ideal treatment regimen for most) without the frequent, costly trips to the office/clinic and back, mainly when the area is small, and the price of the lamp is low.
==Side effects==
Side-effects may include itching and redness of the skin due to UVB exposure, and possibly sunburn, if patients do not minimize exposure to natural UV rays during treatment days. Cataracts can frequently develop if the eyes are not protected from UV light exposure. To date, there is no link between an increase in a patient&#x27;s risk of skin cancer and the proper use of narrow-band UVB phototherapy. &quot;Proper use&quot; is generally defined as reaching the &quot;Sub-Erythemic Dose&quot; (S.E.D.), the maximum amount of UVB your skin can receive &quot;without&quot; burning.
Certain fungal growths under the toenail can be treated using a specific wavelength of UV delivered from a high-power LED (light-emitting diode) and can be safer than traditional systemic drugs.

<doc id="1156149" wikidata="Q34028" url="?curid=1156149" title="Diamantina, Minas Gerais">
<text>Diamantina () is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Minas Gerais. Its estimated population in 2020 was 47,825 in a total area of 3,870 km2.

&quot;Arraial do Tijuco&quot; (as Diamantina was first called) was built during the colonial era in the early 18th century. As its name suggests, Diamantina was a center of diamond mining in the 18th and 19th centuries. A well-preserved example of Brazilian Baroque architecture, Diamantina is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Other historical cities in Minas Gerais are Ouro Preto, São João del-Rei, Mariana, Tiradentes, Congonhas and Sabará.

==Statistical micro-region==
Diamantina is a statistical micro-region that includes the following municipalities: Diamantina, Datas, Felício dos Santos, Gouveia, Presidente Kubitschek, São Gonçalo do Rio Preto, Senador Modestino Gonçalves, and Couto de Magalhães de Minas. The area of this region is 7,348 km2 and in 2006 the population was 80,063 inhabitants. The population density (2000) was 11.2 inhabitants/km2.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
Before the arrival of Portuguese settlers, in the 16th century (the first reports give account of expeditions that went up the Jequitinhonha and São Francisco Rivers), Diamantina, like the entire region of the current state of Minas Gerais, was occupied by indigenous peoples of the Macro-Jê languages.

=== Foundation and exploration of diamonds ===
Diamantina was founded as Arraial do Tejuco in 1713, with the construction of a chapel that honored the patron Saint Anthony of Padua. The locality had strong growth when the Diamonds were discovered in 1729. At the end of the 18th century, it was the third largest population in the Captaincy General of Minas, behind the capital Vila Rica, today Ouro Preto, and with a population similar to that of the prosperous São João del-Rei.

In the 18th century it grew due to the large local production of diamonds, which were exploited by the Portuguese crown. It was initially known as Arraial do Tejuco (or Tijuco) (from the Tupi tyîuka, &quot;rotten water&quot;), Tejuco and Ybyty&#x27;ro&#x27;y (Tupi word meaning &quot;cold mountain&quot;, by the junction of ybytyra (&quot;mountain&quot;).) and ro&#x27;y (&quot;cold&quot;). During the 18th century, the city was famous for having sheltered Chica da Silva, a freed slave who was the wife of the richest man in Colonial Brazil, João Fernandes de Oliveira.

Diamantina represented the largest mining of diamonds in the western world in the 18th century, and for nine years, the Portuguese Crown was not aware of the discovery of diamonds in the region, which was done by the governor of the Captaincy, in 1729, the then D. Lourenço de Almeida.

Portugal&#x27;s response was to impose full control over the diamond regions of Minas Gerais. In 1734, the Intendency of Diamonds was created, whose regime was totally controlling and authoritarian.

The Portuguese Crown&#x27;s monopoly over diamond deposits lasted until 1845.

=== Incorporation, transformation into historical heritage and recent history ===
Diamantina emancipated itself from the municipality of Serro only in 1831, changing its name to Diamantina because of the large volume of diamonds found in the region. The delay was due to the need for greater local control by the colonial authorities, since in the mid-18th century the population was larger than that of Vila do Príncipe do Serro Frio, head of the region. Life in Diamantina at the end of the 19th century was portrayed by Alice Brant in her book &quot;Minha Vida de Menina&quot;, which became a landmark in Brazilian literature after being rediscovered by Elizabeth Bishop.In 1938, Diamantina celebrated its 100th anniversary as a city, receiving the title of &quot;National Historic Heritage&quot; from the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage.

With the arrival of Juscelino Kubitschek to the state government and later to the Presidency of the Republic, many improvements were made in Diamantina, such as the foundation of the Federal School of Dentistry of Diamantina, the Hotel Tijuco, the Júlia Kubitschek State School and the Diamantina Sports Square.

In 1999, it was elevated to the category of &quot;heritage of humanity&quot; by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

== Geography ==
Diamantina is located 292 kilometers almost directly north of the state capital, Belo Horizonte, in a mountainous area. The elevation of the municipal seat is 1,114 meters. The Jequitinhonha River, one of Brazil&#x27;s most important rivers, flows to the east of the municipal seat. Diamantina is linked to the state capital by federal highway BR-259, by way of Curvelo. Diamantina Airport has regular flights to Belo Horizonte.

The municipality contains the Biribiri State Park, created in 1998, which contains the historic village of Biribiri.

Neighboring municipalities are: Olhos d&#x27;Água and Bocaiúva (N); Carbonita, Senador Modestino Gonçalves, São Gonçalo do Rio Preto, and Couto de Magalhaes de Minas (E); Santo Antônio do Itambé, Datas, Serro and Monjolos (S); Augusto de Lima, Buenópolis, and Engenheiro Navarro (W).

<doc id="1156154" wikidata="Q6184220" url="?curid=1156154" title="Jerry Ouellette">
<text>Jerry J. Ouellette (born January 30, 1959) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014, representing the riding of Oshawa. He served in the cabinet in the government of Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Ouellette was born in Oshawa, Ontario. He graduated from Durham College in business administration. He managed a lumber operation and a national consulting firm. Ouellette is a former member of the governing board of Durham College, and a member of the Oshawa Naval Veterans Association. He is currently CEO of Chaga Health and Wellness. 

==Politics==
Ouellette was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent New Democrat Allan Pilkey in Oshawa by about 8,000 votes. He was re-elected by about 7,000 votes over Liberal Chris Topple in the 1999 provincial election, with the NDP falling to third place. He was re-elected in 2003, 2007, and 2011.

Ouellette supported Ernie Eves in the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s 2002 leadership convention, and on April 15, 2002, was appointed Ontario Minister of Natural Resources. In this capacity, he was generally regarded as an ally of the province&#x27;s fishing and hunting community.

In the 2003 provincial election, Ouellette faced a strong challenge from provincial union representative and NDP candidate Sid Ryan. This was Ryan&#x27;s third unsuccessful bid for a provincial seat (1999, Scarborough-Centre; 2003 and 2007, Oshawa) and his fifth electoral loss having been twice defeated by Colin Carrie, Oshawa&#x27;s Conservative candidate and MP, in 2004 and 2006. Ouellette struggled to retain his seat, winning the 2003 race by 1,019 votes. But the Progressive Conservatives lost the election and Ouellette moved to the opposition benches. Four years later, during the 2007 provincial election, Ouellette defeated Ryan a second time. He was re-elected in the 2011 provincial election.

In the 2014 provincial election he was defeated by New Democratic candidate Jennifer French by 7,692 votes.

<doc id="1156159" wikidata="Q6394277" url="?curid=1156159" title="Kerosene Hat">
<text>Kerosene Hat is the second studio album by American rock band Cracker, released on August 24, 1993. It reached number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers chart, and number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The singles from the album, &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Get Off This&quot;, helped Cracker gain widespread notice.

According to frontman David Lowery, the album title comes from the band&#x27;s early days in Richmond, Virginia. Lowery lived with Cracker guitarist Johnny Hickman in an old dilapidated house whose only source of heat came from two kerosene heaters. To buy more kerosene meant a cold walk to a nearby gas station, so before leaving the house, Lowery would bundle up and put on an old wool hunting cap – his &quot;kerosene hat.&quot; &quot;To this day,&quot; says Lowery, &quot;the smell of kerosene reminds me of the poverty and the wistful hope we had for our music.&quot;

== Background and recording notes ==

Following the release of their debut album, Cracker entered the studio in 1992 intending to record their next album completely live to tape. This idea was eventually scrapped, but four live-in-the-studio tracks were released later that same year as the &quot;Tucson&quot; EP.

Seeking a new recording location away from the distractions of Los Angeles and their record company, the band scouted out a few sites, including a Palm Springs house that once belonged to Frank Sinatra. Eventually, they happened upon a derelict soundstage in Pioneertown, California, which was part of an old movie set once used to shoot Western films and TV shows.

As Johnny Hickman recalls: &quot;It really wasn&#x27;t that much of a sound stage. It was more of a barn. There were holes in the wall you could see through and it was just a huge, huge barn basically. But it was just big enough to open the doors and drive a mobile recording truck into. So we got all of our equipment and the truck into the barn and shut the door and for the next six weeks proceeded to make &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot;.&quot;

Recording took place from Feb 25 to March 25, 1993. The weather was cold, and the band salvaged old mattresses and other material from the junkyard to insulate the makeshift studio.

== Song notes ==

The leadoff track from the album, &quot;Low,&quot; had a major impact on the album&#x27;s success. After Hickman started playing the song&#x27;s signature riff during a soundcheck in Portland, Oregon, the song came together very quickly. Upon release it became – as noted by &quot;Spin&quot; – &quot;a ubiquitous signpost of the alternative-as-the-new-mainstream era&quot;. Author David Maine calls &quot;Low&quot; &quot;the&quot; signature song of the summer of 1993, as rock radio added it to heavy rotation and the band&#x27;s visibility increased. It peaked at #3 on the Modern Rock Radio charts. The track &quot;Whole Lotta Trouble,&quot; recorded during the &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot; sessions and released as the b-side of the &quot;Low&quot; CD single, was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1995 Gen-X film &quot;Empire Records&quot;.

Contributing to the song&#x27;s success was a noir-ish, black-and-white video shot by director Carlos Grasso, which was added to MTV&#x27;s Buzz Bin. In the video, Lowery spars with comedian Sandra Bernhard in a boxing ring and gets knocked out. Grasso claims that during the video shoot, Lowery insisted that Bernhard&#x27;s punches be real – which meant his face was &quot;all puffy&quot; from the hits by the end of the shoot.

Lowery described &quot;Low&quot; as &quot;part Wizard of Oz, part Flowers of Evil&quot;, while NME called it &quot;grunge noir.&quot; Due to perceived drug references in the song&#x27;s lyrics, Lowery was asked by Virgin Records to write a letter to radio stations swearing that there was nothing drug-related about the song at all. According to the letter, the lyric &quot;being stoned&quot; was actually &quot;being &quot;stone&quot;&quot;.

The second single from the album, &quot;Get Off This,&quot; was written in response to naysayers who accused Cracker of selling out and making music that was more mainstream than Lowery&#x27;s previous band, Camper Van Beethoven. Thematically speaking, the song declares the band&#x27;s independence and desire to write songs that come from an honest place. The song peaked at #6 on the Modern Rock Radio charts.

Written in a New Jersey hotel room, &quot;Eurotrash Girl&quot; tells the story of a lonely young man in Europe who suffers through a series of humiliating episodes. Lowery created the song&#x27;s central character and the other band members suggested additional ideas to the story. Having spent time in Europe, Hickman noted mischievously: &quot;Some of these things [in the song] happened to us, some not.&quot; Even before &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot; was released, the song had become a live fan favorite. So despite protests from Virgin Records of putting too much material on the album, the band surreptitiously included the song, along with &quot;I Ride My Bike,&quot; as hidden tracks during mastering. It was producer Don Smith&#x27;s idea to make &quot;Eurotrash Girl&quot; track 69.

&quot;Sick of Goodbyes&quot; was co-written with Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, and was later re-recorded and released as a single from that band&#x27;s album, &quot;Good Morning Spider&quot;.

The final song on the album proper, &quot;Loser,&quot; is a Grateful Dead cover. Jerry Garcia once told Lowery and Hickman that he approved of their version of the song.

== Legacy ==

In the post-Nirvana climate of early &#x27;90s alternative music, &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot; went gold and would be Cracker&#x27;s most popular album to date. Twenty years after the album&#x27;s release, webzine Spectrum Culture noted, &quot;In the cases when both music and lyrics are on the mark – and there are many – the record achieves something close to greatness.&quot;

Says Lowery: &quot;We&#x27;ve always been a country roots-rock band. We&#x27;ve always leaned on American roots stuff, whether it&#x27;s soul, blues or country... Fortunately, our sound somehow fit into modern rock radio back when grunge had taken over the entire world.&quot;

Hickman adds, &quot;We kind of snuck in the back door by being a band that had something to say and were lucky enough to write a catchy three-minute song.&quot;

Pioneertown, where &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot; was recorded, still holds a special place for the band members, as Cracker hosts a music festival there each year. In 2011, the band paid tribute to its landmark album by performing it live in its entirety.

<text>Lisa Moore (born 28 March 1964) is a Canadian writer and editor established in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Biography==
Born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Moore studied art first at College of the North Atlantic in her home province and then at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Although she had intended to follow a career in the visual arts, she now writes full-time.

Moore&#x27;s work primarily takes place in Newfoundland. She has worked to promote different writers and places of the province by compiling local artists&#x27; text and writing articles about Newfoundland communities. In her new book &quot;The Democracy Cookbook&quot; Moore writes a non-partisan approach to &quot;stir up conversations around cabinet tables&quot;.

Moore&#x27;s daughter Eva Crocker is also a writer, whose debut short story collection &quot;Barrelling Forward&quot; was published in 2017.

== Awards and recognition ==
Moore&#x27;s first two books, &quot;Degrees of Nakedness&quot; (1995) and &quot;Open&quot; (2002), are short story collections. &quot;Open&quot; was a commercial and critical breakthrough, earning a nomination for the Giller Prize. &quot;Open&quot; was subsequently published as an unabridged audiobook. Her first novel, &quot;Alligator&quot; (2005), was also nominated for the Giller Prize. It won the 2006 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize Best Book Award, Caribbean and Canada Region, and was longlisted for the 2007 International Dublin Literary Award.

Moore was one of 13 novelists on the long list for the 2010 Man Booker Prize for &quot;February&quot;, a prize worth approximately $80,000. In an interview with CBC Radio, Moore said she was &quot;completely overwhelmed with happiness&quot; when she heard the news while staying in a remote cabin with her husband.

On February 15, 2013, &quot;February&quot; won &quot;Canada Reads 2013: Turf Wars&quot;.

She released her newest short story collection, &quot;Something for Everyone&quot;, in 2018. The book was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2018 Scotiabank Giller Prize.

Her book &quot;Invisible Prisons: Jack Whalen’s Tireless Fight for Justice&quot;, cowritten with Whalen, was a finalist for the Hilary Weston Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction.

<text>David Grace (born 1949 in Rugby, Warwickshire, England) is a British racing driver and businessman. He was the CEO at Rockingham Motor Speedway between 2000 and 2002, and oversaw the opening of the track and the return, after many years, of CART racing to Britain.

As a driver his greatest successes came in hillclimbing, where he was five times British Hillclimb Champion (1993-94-98-99-2000), an achievement placing him level with Martyn Griffiths and behind only six-times champion Tony Marsh. After joining Rockingham he ceased to climb regularly, but made occasional appearances in circuit racing. Grace made a brief return to hillclimbing in 2003 after leaving Rockingham.

Outside motorsport Grace has a successful and varied career in business management.

<doc id="1156179" wikidata="Q17564577" url="?curid=1156179" title="Soluna">
<text>Soluna was a music group consisting of four members, all of Hispanic descent – Aurora Rodriguez, America Olivo, Jessica Castellanos, and Christina &quot;T&quot; López. The group&#x27;s name is the combination the Spanish words for sun (&quot;sol&quot;) and moon (&quot;luna&quot;). Both Lopez and Castellanos are pursuing primarily solo music careers, and Olivo is developing an acting resume, including a recent role on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Music career==
===1998: Group formation===
Soluna began in 1998 when Jessica Castellanos met Aurora Rodriguez and America through a mutual producer they were working with individually. The three began singing together, and after discovering the harmony and chemistry with their voices, they then sought a fourth member to complete the group.

Another producer named Nick Martinez recommended to them a young girl he&#x27;d met while driving in Ontario, California. He had stopped at a local auto-body shop due to car trouble and saw the owner&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s picture on the wall. The girl&#x27;s father assured him his daughter was talented and could sing. Her name was Christina &quot;T&quot; Lopez, and after singing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; over the phone, she became the final member of Soluna. Shortly after their line-up was complete, Soluna signed with DreamWorks Records.

===2001: Musical debut - &quot;For All Time&quot;===
Soluna&#x27;s debut album was finished by summer of 2001. It featured tracks with pop, rock, dance and Latin sounds due to the influence of producers Steve Morales, Tim &amp; Bob, Josh &amp; Brian, Thunderpuss 2000, Ozomatli and Tim Miner. The members of Soluna produced one track (the a cappella &quot;Te Vengo A Decir&quot;) and co-wrote five others (&quot;Bring It To Me,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting,&quot; &quot;So In Love,&quot; &quot;Spanish Lullaby,&quot; and &quot;Luna Mia&quot;). The uptempo song &quot;Bring It To Me&quot; was picked as the first single and rose to the Top 20 of Billboard&#x27;s Dance Chart

However, following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Soluna decided to go in a different musical direction by focusing on promoting a power ballad, &quot;For All Time,&quot; as their new single. The single was released commercially along with an a cappella arrangement of several patriotic songs (&quot;A Patriotic Medley&quot;). In 2002, Soluna performed at the NAACP Image Awards, as well as Elton John&#x27;s 10th annual Oscar Gala. &quot;For All Time&quot; was formally released to radio on February 12, 2002. The debut album of the same name was released on May 14, 2002.

&quot;For All Time&quot; became Soluna&#x27;s best-known song. The corresponding video, directed by Bille Woodruff, was shot in both English and Spanish in June 2002 and premiered on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on July 24, 2002. This track made the Top 20 of Billboard&#x27;s Top 40 Mainstream Chart as well as the Top 30 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. During this time, Soluna toured as the opening act for artists such as Enrique Iglesias and Marc Anthony. The quartet also traveled to Puerto Rico and Mexico to promote their music.

The third single from the &quot;For All Time&quot; album was a Latin-influenced dance track, &quot;Monday Mi Amor.&quot; It was released to radio on November 11, 2002. During its first week on the charts, it was among the top ten most-added tracks in the CHR/POP Category for Radio. The dance remix to &quot;Monday Mi Amor&quot; by DJ Wildlife peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Breakout Chart, which was Soluna&#x27;s highest charting.

===2002–2004: Additional recordings===
During this time, Soluna had been writing and recording tracks for a second album, which was to be a Spanish language disc.

In May 2004, Soluna announced they had recorded a duet with recording artist J. Roman (a former member of the group Vi3). This track, entitled &quot;Where Are You?&quot; premiered on Chicago&#x27;s B96 radio on May 17, 2004. Jessica was featured on the verses while all group members sang the chorus. A Spanish version (&quot;Donde Esta?&quot;) was also recorded, as well as a pseudo cover of Eddie Money&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, with Castellanos singing the chorus and J.Roman performing original verses in a rap style. While &quot;Where Are You?&quot; achieved moderate success and radio play, J. Roman re-recorded it with a new female singer, Natalie, and this new version was released to radio. The song was released on Natalie&#x27;s debut album as a bonus track, but the song received little attention.

===2004: Hiatus===
The members of Soluna decided to part ways in late 2004. However, the group disbanded on amiable terms and left the option open of an eventual reunion.

Jessica Castellanos, America Olivo, and T López later pursued solo music projects.

===2016: Reunion===
The group, minus Jessica, reunited for a Christmas EP in 2016.

==Further projects==

Shortly after &quot;Monday Mi Amor&quot; was released, the members of Soluna announced that they were beginning to work out a sitcom deal with UPN based on their adventures in the music business. The pilot was shot in April 2004 but was not picked up. They appeared in an episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s first Latino-influenced show &quot;The Brothers Garcia&quot; in December 2002.

Olivo has appeared on &quot;House&quot; (twice as recurring role &quot;Ingrid, the Masseuse&quot;), &quot;Jake in Progress&quot;, &quot;Cuts&quot; and &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. Olivo has also wrapped a small role in the vampire gore flick &quot;The Thirst.&quot; She has since wrapped roles in the independent film &quot;Love Shack&quot; as well as a cameo role in the upcoming Iron Man. In 2006, Olivo launched her own solo website, as well as a MySpace page. Between both sites, she released several demo songs, and announced several film roles as well as a lead role in the Hollywood, CA base theatre production of &quot;Hotel C&#x27;Est L&#x27;Amour&quot; as &quot;Maria&quot;, which ran at The Blank&#x27;s Second Stage from September 26, 2006 to November 5, 2006. Since 2006, four demo songs have premiered: &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;Porcelain Eyes&quot;, &quot;Deja Vu&quot; and &quot;Water From the Moon.&quot; Olivo recently announced she will appear in two new independent films: &quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;The Resort.&quot; On January 14, 2008, it was officially announced that Olivo was cast as Marietta on ABC soap opera General Hospital, and would begin appearing on January 22, 2008. She is set to appear in the films Friday the 13th and Bitch Slap.

Lopez has appeared on TV shows &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;South of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and &quot;&quot;. She also serves as a host on the &quot;SiTV&quot; show &quot;The Drop.&quot; She has wrapped small roles in &quot;Hollywood Kills&quot; and &quot;The Boys and Girls Guide to Getting Down&quot; satirical documentary. Also in 2006, Lopez launched her own solo music MySpace page. No music had premiered, however Lopez stated she was working on both English and Spanish solo albums. In August 2007, Lopez confirmed she signed to Cash Money Records. She appeared on the cover of Nuestro Mundo Magazine&#x27;s January 2007 issue.

==Awards==

In February 2003, Soluna won an award for Best New Pop Artist at the Los Heraldos Awards in Mexico. They were also nominated for two International Dance Awards in 2002: Best New Dance Artist Group, and Best Latin Dance Track for &quot;Monday Mi Amor.

<text>This article covers the history of women in the United States Senate and various milestones achieved by female senators. It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. As of January 2025, 64 women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress, of which 26 (16 Democrats and 10 Republicans) are currently serving (out of 100 possible seats).

Nancy Kassebaum (born July 29, 1932) is the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age of .

==History==

For its first 130 years in existence, the Senate&#x27;s membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This was due to many factors, including the lack of women&#x27;s suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women&#x27;s limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women&#x27;s advancement such as sex discrimination.

The first time a woman was nominated for the Senate was in 1893 in Wyoming, where women had had the vote since 1869. The nomination happened via a party caucus, since this was before 1913 when the Seventeenth Amendment established popular elections for Senators. Mary Jane Bartlett was nominated by the Wyoming Populists, receiving their unanimous nomination. However, the Wyoming legislature was deadlocked for weeks of voting on their senators: Republicans, Democrats, and Populists mostly backed their own candidates. Bartlett received all six populist votes on a number of ballots in the legislature, but time ran out to choose the senator, and Wyoming ended up serving with only one senator, rather than two, that term.

The first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day as a symbolic gesture in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. She first filled the vacancy caused by her husband&#x27;s death, and then was elected to two full terms. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation&#x27;s first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana&#x27;s First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s unexpected death in office. Humphrey Brown was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota to fill her late husband&#x27;s Senate seat; she served for less than one year and did not seek to be elected to her husband&#x27;s seat.

In 1978, Nancy Kassebaum became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate, representing Kansas, without her husband having previously served in Congress. Since the beginning of Kassebaum&#x27;s service in December 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Florida Republican Paula Hawkins, elected in 1980. She was also the first and, to date, only female member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the &quot;Year of the Woman.&quot; Barbara Mikulski was reelected and four new Democratic women were elected to the Senate. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Barbara Boxer of California. Carol Moseley Braun was the first woman of color to serve in the Senate and the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator after she won the 1992 Democratic primary election over Alan J. Dixon. Later in 1992, Feinstein was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated John Seymour in a special election. Feinstein entered the Senate the same year as the first female Jewish senator.

Bathroom facilities for women in the Senate on the Senate chamber level were first provided in 1992. Women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993. In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.

The first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993. Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was then joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive &quot;boys&#x27; club&quot;. Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002).

Olympia Snowe of Maine arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the US House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and later Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, Stabenow and Maria Cantwell became the first women to defeat incumbent &quot;elected&quot; senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively. Hillary Clinton is the first and only First Lady to run for or win a Senate seat. Clinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

In 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.

In November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history, surpassing Barbara Mikulski, having served for 30 years. Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025, but died in office on September 29, 2023, before her term ended. Subsequently, Patty Murray surpassed Feinstein as the longest serving woman senator, and continues to serve.

In 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.

In 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate. In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California&#x27;s recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.

Starting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate. Additionally, in 2024, former U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte was elected Governor of New Hampshire, becoming the third woman and first Republican woman to hold this distinction.

In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona&#x27;s first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona&#x27;s other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year&#x27;s special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.

Also in 2018, Jacky Rosen made political history as the first female one-term outgoing U.S. representative ever elected to the Senate.

In 2023, Patty Murray became the first woman to serve as president pro tempore, a role traditionally given to the most senior member of the majority party in the United States Senate. Dianne Feinstein was the most senior Democratic senator but declined to serve. This made Murray the third person in line to become president, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House.

Sixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789. Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.

Some female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president—see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate.

==Election, selection, and family==
Women are much less likely than men to decide to run for election, despite generally having the same chances of winning elections as male counterparts. Research by Jennifer Lawless and Richard Fox shine light on a few possible reasons. Women report much less enthusiasm for the motions of campaigning (such as fundraising or attending rallies) than men. They are more likely than men to decide not to campaign based on lack of resources. They are also much more likely than men to view themselves as lacking credentials, and time (even women with full-time jobs report spending more time on household chores than men). Finally, they are more likely than men to view races as competitive.

Before 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.

Recent examples of selection include Jean Carnahan and Lisa Murkowski. In 2000, Jean Carnahan (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, Mel Carnahan. Carnahan—even though dead—defeated the incumbent senator, John Ashcroft. Carnahan&#x27;s widow was named to fill his seat by Governor of Missouri Roger Wilson until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent 2002 special election to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father Governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski, who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her election bid in 2004.

Two recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), was married to former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole (R-KS) and served as United States Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), wife of former president Bill Clinton, was First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an unsuccessful campaign for her party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the secretary of state for the eventual victor of that election, Barack Obama. In 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party&#x27;s presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Another famous name is Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).

Among the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at , whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at .

==List of female U.S. senators==

==Currently serving female U.S. senators==

There are 26 women currently serving in the United States Senate. This is the highest number of women to have served concurrently in U.S. Senate history. Sixteen are Democrats and ten are Republicans.

The record was first achieved in January 2020 when Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate from 25 to 26. The number fell back to 25 on December 2 of the same year when Martha McSally&#x27;s appointment ended after she lost an election to finish John McCain&#x27;s unexpired term. The record of 26 was reached again on January 3, 2021, when Cynthia Lummis, the first female senator from Wyoming, began her term. The record was sustained for only 15 days, as the number of concurrently serving women dropped again to 25 when Kamala Harris resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as vice president (and thus president of the Senate) on January 20.

The record of 26 concurrently serving women was reached a third time on January 21, 2025 when Ashley Moody was appointed to the Senate from Florida (see the histograph of the number of female Senators).

As of January 2025, four states: (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators (see appropriate section).

11 of the women currently serving in the Senate have previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives: Senators Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Rosen, Blackburn, Lummis, Blunt Rochester, and Slotkin.

==List of states represented by women==
34 states have been represented by female senators. As of January 3, 2025, 21 states are represented by female senators.

===Timeline===
==Concurrently serving women from the same state==
On January 3, 2019, Arizona&#x27;s Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally became the first women from the same state to start serving in the Senate on the same date.

==Elections with two female major-party nominees==
Incumbent senators (at the time of the election in question) are in bold.

==Pregnancies==
On April 9, 2018, Tammy Duckworth, at age 50, gave birth to her daughter Maile Pearl, becoming the first sitting senator to give birth. Shortly thereafter, the Senate&#x27;s rules were changed to allow senators to bring with them to the Senate floor children under one year of age during votes, as well as explicitly allow breastfeeding. The day after those rules were changed, Maile became the first baby on the Senate floor when Duckworth brought her.

<text>Immingham is a town and civil parish in North East Lincolnshire, England, on the south-west bank of the Humber Estuary, northwest of Grimsby.

It was relatively unpopulated until the early 1900s, when the Great Central Railway began developing Immingham Dock; as a consequence of the docks, and post-Second World War large scale industrial developments, Immingham became a significant town during the 20th century. The Port of Immingham &amp; Grimsby was the largest port in the United Kingdom by tonnage with 54 million tonnes of cargo passing through in 2019.

==Geography==

===Council ward===
The Immingham Ward of North East Lincolnshire Council includes Stallingborough, Healing and Habrough. As of 2018, its elected councillors are Stewart Swinburn (Conservative), David Bolton (Labour), and David Watson (Labour).

Population of the ward in 2001 was 11,804 persons (2001 census), and 11,507 persons in 2011 (2011 census).

European route E22 passes through Immingham on the A180 and A160 via Immingham Dock.

===Civil parish===

The civil parish of Immingham is located on the south bank of the Humber Estuary west-northwest of Grimsby. The civil parish is bounded by South Killingholme to the north-west, with the drain watercourse outfalling at South Killingholme Haven forming the boundary – also the county boundary between North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. The south-eastern boundary is with the civil parish of Stallingborough, with the North Beck Drain forming most of the boundary. The parish extends to the south-west as far as Roxton, with boundaries to the south-west and south with the civil parishes of Habrough and Keelby.

The civil parish is low lying, extending from below above sea level near the Humber foreshore, to a peak of in Roxton wood in the south-west corner. The main features within the parish are the Humber shoreline, running roughly north-west to south-east, the Immingham Dock and estate, and adjacent south of the dock the town of Immingham. The A180 and Stallingborough-Habrough section of the mainline railway west out of Grimsby (Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway) pass roughly east–west through the southern part of the parish. The A1173 connects the town and dock to the A180. Excluding farms there are no other places of habitation outside the town in the civil parish.

There are two abandoned sites of medieval villages in the parish: that of the village of Immingham, north-west of the modern town, near St Andrew&#x27;s Church; and Roxton in the southern extremity of the parish.

Population of the civil parish was 9,861 in 2001, and 9,642 in 2011.

===Town===
The mayor of Immingham is Kevin Houghton who was elected to follow Stefan Allan, who was elected on 15 May 2019, and then re-elected the following year. Allan currently serves as Houghton&#x27;s deputy. Before his election as mayor, Allan served as the deputy to preceding mayor and mayoress George Fox, and his wife Veronica Fox.

The town of Immingham is a compact urban area of approximately , situated south-west of the dock in the middle of the parish. It is bisected by the B1210.

The town has a retail centre, &quot;Kennedy Way&quot;, with stores such as Tesco and Aldi, a leisure centre with swimming pool and gym, and several schools.

On the north-eastern outskirts of the town there is a Knauf UK GmbH plant that makes plasterboard.

===Transport===
Immingham was formerly served by two railways, the Barton and Immingham Light Railway mainly carrying freight traffic to and from the dock, and the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway carrying passengers between the town and the dock. Both were withdrawn by the early 1960s. In the present day, the nearest railway stations are at and on the former Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway, now part of the Barton line.

A half-hourly bus service currently operated by Stagecoach East Midlands links Immingham with Grimsby.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Humberside, Hits Radio East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Hits Radio Lincolnshire broadcasting on DAB and Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire.

The &quot;Grimsby Telegraph&quot; is the local newspaper that serves the town.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Immingham&quot; is thought to mean the &quot;Homestead of the people of Imma&quot;; (de)constructed from the elements &quot;Imma&quot; + &quot;inga&quot; + &quot;ham&quot;.

The place was referred to as &quot;Imungeham&quot; in the Domesday Book, and recorded as &quot;Immingeham&quot; in around 1115.

The termination &quot;-ham&quot; is Anglo-Saxon in origin. The patronymic, (interpreted as &quot;Imming&quot; or &quot;Emming&quot;) has been noted as occurring elsewhere, such as in &quot;Imminghausen&quot; (Immenhausen), or &quot;Emmingen&quot; (Emmingen-Liptingen) (Germany).

===Early history===
Immingham is mentioned (as &quot;Imungeham&quot;) as a manor in the 11th-century Domesday Book.
Saint Andrew&#x27;s church dates to the early medieval period, with much of the structure dating to the 13th century, with parts of the nave as early as the 11th or 12th century. The tower was constructed in the 16th/17th century, to a similar design to that found in nearby Aylesby, Wootton and Healing. The structure was restored in the 1880s and 1920. A decorated octagonal font in the church dates to the 15th C. The remains of a stone cross outside the church also dates to the medieval period.

There is archaeological evidence of the medieval settlement. Earthwork remains indicating a settlement and agricultural use exist near south of the church; earthwork remnants of a former shrunken village exist to the north of the church. Archaeological evidence of saltmaking has been found north of the village (formerly in the parish of Harbrough, now within the dock estate), references to a saltmaking site here exist from the Domesday book, and in a late 12th-century document describing the gift of land including the saltpan to Newhouse Abbey.
In 1608 the village briefly became a location in the story of the Pilgrim Fathers of America; their vessel was forced to put ashore due to bad weather, sailing up Killingholme Creek; the women of the party were allowed to sleep in the village church for the night, but news of this reached the authorities, with the consequence that the womenfolk were arrested, whilst the others escaped to the Netherlands. A popular protest secured the release of the women, who were then able to rejoin their families, and continue the journey.

In the later medieval period Immingham declined from 66 households in 1523 to 46 in 1723, in common with other Lincolnshire places on or near the Humber banks. The silting of the haven leading from the Humber has been supposed as one possible cause.
Churchfield Manor, in the north-west of the town dates to the late 1600s/early 1700s. Belmont cottage south of the church dates to the early 1800s. Both are now listed structures.

The Ings at Immingham were enclosed in 1840. A coastguard station erected in 1850. The Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway (opened 1845) passed through the parish south of Immingham.

In the 1870s the parish of Immingham had a population of 237, whilst Roxton was still known as a small hamlet. The parish had an area of which was mostly good grazing land – much of which was owned by the Earl of Yarborough. In addition to the church the village also had Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels.

===1900–1950===

Building of the Immingham Dock began in 1906, and it was opened by King George V on 22 July 1912. In part funded by the Great Central Railway, the dock property was ; covering , with of water. A railway line to the north-west, the Barton and Immingham Light Railway was opened in 1912. The docks were connected to their primary supply of labour in Grimsby by the Grimsby &amp; Immingham Electric Railway, opened 1912. As part of the development of the new port some wood framed, corrugated iron clad housing was constructed; several of these survived to the 21st century, and one of these dated 1907 is now a listed structure.

During the First World War, Immingham served as a base for British D class submarines. There was also an anti-aircraft battery in the town, manned with 1 pounder and later a 12-pounder gun.

By the 1920s the village of Immingham had been eclipsed in importance by the port; a publication of the Cambridge University Press opined:

By the early 1930s housing development was scattered across several locations: most was along Pelham Road, of which the majority was east of the original village (St Andrew&#x27;s church), centred around the &quot;County Hotel&quot;, and close to the dock estate; further development had taken place south and south-east of the church, also on Pelham Road, in two locations each centred on one of the two nonconformist chapels. Almost all the housing was terraced, with the more generous ground plans found moving south-west along Pelham Road. By the mid-1930s the village had grown as much to require a comprehensive school which opened in 1936.

During the Second World War, John Dowland and Leonard Harrison received the George Cross for defusing a bomb that had fallen onto the grain ship SS &quot;Kildare&quot; in February 1940 in Immingham Dock. Anti-aircraft batteries were located around the dock during the war, as well as at Homestead Park, and near Immingham Grange.

The Humber Force, part of the Home Fleet which had two cruisers and a destroyer flotilla, including HMS Afridi (F07) was based at Immingham during the war, as well as submarines including HMS Seal (N37).

===1950–present===

At the beginning of the 1950s the village of Immingham had little expanded. Development of new industries on the South Humber bank after the Second World War caused further growth of the town. By 1981 the population had risen to 11,506; making it North Lincolnshire&#x27;s fourth town, after Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Scunthorpe.

The expansion of the village included: &quot;Eastfield County Junior School&quot; built in 1970; expansion of the comprehensive school, 1973; a shopping centre &quot;Kennedy Way&quot; constructed in 1965–7; and north of the centre 18 blocks of five storey flats constructed by George Wimpey from 1965; a Civic Centre also opened in 1965.

Standard housing also expanded: By 1968 there were many new side streets, in particular a new estate encompassed by Pilgrim Avenue; development along Pelham Road had become almost continuous, and the new village now expanding north-west towards the old Immingham. Further growth took place in the late 1960 and 1970s: north-west of Pelham Road, with the village continuous towards Church Lane; a new estate south-east of Pilgrim Road; as well as further infilling to the south-west.

Immingham Dock Station, originally part of the Barton and Immingham Light Railway closed in 1969, whilst Immingham Museum was established in 1970. In 1979 the Kennedy Way centre was extended to house a further supermarket and other shop units. The local council added a Sports centre in 1980. The expansion of the new town had peaked by the mid-1980s, with only minor extra expansion in the next two decades to 2006.

In 2007 Immingham School was renamed Oasis Academy Immingham.

Supermarket retailers Somerfield took over a former Kwik Save shop at Kennedy Way c.2006; the branch became part of the Co-op after the takeover of the chain in 2010; in 2014 the Co-op announced it was to close the shop (closed September 2014). Supermarket chain Aldi acquired the site in 2014 with the aim of opening a new store in 2015; the store was opened in May 2015 by the Mayor of Immingham.

The town&#x27;s Yorkshire Bank closed in August 2009 after 40 years of operation. the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society closed their Immingham office in March 2010; Barclays Bank closed their branch in the centre in late 2010.

In 2012 planning permission was granted for a new large Tesco store to the north of Immingham Civic Centre, (originally consented 2009.), and refurbishment and alterations to the Kennedy Way shopping centre. Preparatory work on a £10 million Tesco supermarket began 2014, with the Immingham Sports Centre to be demolished; a new sports facility was to be provided at Oasis Academy. A Poundstretcher opened in November 2014 at the development, and B &amp; M store in December 2014. The new &quot;Multi User Games Area&quot; (MUGA) opened March 2015.

In January 2015 Tesco announced cost-cutting plans following falling sales, and halted development of 49 stores, The built but unopened store in Immingham was mothballed, having had its opening previously delayed. As of late 2015 the unopened Tesco supermarket was being retained by Tesco. On 20 September 2018 Tesco opened one of their first Jack&#x27;s stores in the unused building.
In early 2016 work began on the reconstruction of Immingham Civic Centre – an aim was to concentrate public services at one location including Immingham Town Council, North East Lincolnshire Council offices, Humberside Police offices, Shoreline (housing agent) offices, a Library and the Immingham museum, which portrays the role of the Great Central Railway in the building of the docks and construction of the local rail network. The museum, which is home to the Great Central Railway Society archive, is open from 1pm to 4pm, Wednesday to Saturday from March through to November.

==Governance==
At the lowest level of governance is Immingham Town Council. Immingham has 3 electoral wards, electing a total of 15 councillors. These councillors are responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and some street lighting. Elections to the town council are held every four years and the most recent elections were held in May 2019. The Mayor of Immingham is elected annually by the members of the town council.

At county level the town is part of North East Lincolnshire Council unitary authority area, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. The town is represented by three Unitary councillors on North East Lincolnshire Council. The county council provides a full range of local government services including Council Tax billing, libraries, social services, processing planning applications, waste collection and disposal, and it is a local education authority.

In the United Kingdom Parliament, Immingham is part of the Brigg and Immingham constituency, represented by Conservative MP, Martin Vickers. The Brigg and Immingham constituency also includes other towns in the area including Barton-upon-Humber.

==Roxton==
There was once a village at Roxton. The medieval village is evidenced by earthworks, as well a nearby cropmarking to the east. Additionally there may once have been a moated enclosure between Immingham and Roxton, now lost and not visible on modern maps.

<text>Liangshan County () is a county situated in the southwest of Shandong province, China. It is administered by the prefecture-level city of Jining.

==Geography==
Liangshan County is situated north west of Jining in the south west of Shandong province. To the east it borders the prefecture-level cities of Tai&#x27;an, Heze to the west. To the north, the Yellow River separates Liangshan from Puyang, in Henan province.

==Climate==

==History==
The area was from prehistoric times surrounded by the largest marshland in north China, called the Daye Marsh and later the Liangshan Marsh. Because the area was largely a wasteland on the frontiers of several administrative units, government control was minimal, and bandit chiefs were active in the area. During the Song dynasty Liang Shan (Mount Liang) became known as the &quot;eight hundred li moorage of Mount Liang&quot; and located at the extreme north of the Yellow River which passed through the area. When the Yellow River shifted course in 1289, the marshes of Liangshan shrunk considerably. During the Ming dynasty it had been reduced to five smaller marshlands. Banditry continued on Mount Liang until the mid-seventeenth century, when the Qing dynasty government established a military garrison. The city of Liangshan evolved from the garrison. After the Yellow River shifted back to its northern course in 1853, the marshes were gradually filled in by sediments carried downstream by the river and human land reclamation. Today the relatively small Dongping Lake() is what remains of the great marshes.

==Administrative divisions==
As 2012, this county is divided to 9 towns and 4 townships.

;Townships
==Tourism==
The famous mountain Mount Liang (Liáng Shān) rises to 197.9 m above sea level is located within Liangshan County administrative territory. It is well known as the stronghold of the 108 legendary Song dynasty heroes of the classic Chinese novel the &quot;Water Margin&quot;.

<text>The University of Montevallo is a public university in Montevallo, Alabama. Founded on October 12, 1896, the university is Alabama&#x27;s only public liberal arts college and a member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges. The University of Montevallo Historic District was established on campus in 1979. The school is located in a rural location in central Alabama.

==History==

The main part of the campus was designed by the Olmsted Brothers, and the central part is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The university opened in October 1896 as the Alabama Girls&#x27; Industrial School (AGIS), a women-only technical school that also offered high school-level courses.
Annie Kennedy was the first member of the faculty elected at the AGIS. AGIS became the Alabama Girls&#x27; Technical Institute in 1911, further adding &quot;and College for Women&quot; in 1919. The school gradually developed as a traditional degree-granting institution, becoming Alabama College, State College for Women in 1923.

The school effectively became coeducational after lobbying by the school&#x27;s supporters resulted in the Alabama Legislature passing a bill on January 15, 1956 to remove the designation &quot;State College for Women&quot;. The first men entered the school that same month. Its student body still maintains a 7:5 ratio of women to men.

In 1965, the board of trustees authorized President D.P. Culp to sign the Certificates of Assurance of Compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the fall of 1968, three African American women, Carolyn Burpo, Ruby Kennbrew and Dorothy (Lilly) Turner, enrolled in the university. On September 1, 1969, Alabama College was renamed the University of Montevallo.

The Alabama Girls&#x27; Industrial School was listed on the National Register in 1978. In 1990, the University of Montevallo Historic District was listed on the National Register, as an expansion.

Montevallo is in the geographic center of Alabama in an area rich with Civil War history. Many of the buildings on campus predate the founding of the college, including King House (reserved for special guests of the campus) and Reynolds Hall (used by the Theater Department and alumni relations). King House was reportedly the first home in Alabama to receive pane glass windows. With nearly 3,000 students, the university has a significant economic impact on the surrounding communities in Shelby County.

==Traditions==

=== College Night ===
The University of Montevallo&#x27;s homecoming tradition, called College Night, is a coeducational competition in which students may participate for either the Purple Side or the Gold Side, named after the school&#x27;s colors. The tradition of College Night began as a celebration of the upcoming renaming of Alabama Girls&#x27; Technical Institute to Alabama College. First taking place on March 3, 1919, as a competition between the four classes, the Class of 1919 said that &quot;now that our school is becoming a college, we have begun to take up college stunts.&quot;

The main event of College Night is the performance of musical theater productions by each side. The shows are composed, directed, produced, and performed by student participants. The competition also currently involves four athletic events: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, and men&#x27;s ultimate Frisbee.

In honor of A.G.T.I.&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1921, College Night became a competition between two sides, Purple and Gold, instead of a competition between the classes.

In 2000, College Night was declared a &quot;Local Legacy&quot; by the Library of Congress, with an exhibit containing audio recordings of Purple and Gold side songs, photographs, College Night programs, and other artifacts.

===Crook Week/Senior March===

Traditionally, Crook Week was a week in late October when the senior class women would hide the &quot;crook&quot;—a staff shaped roughly like a shepherd&#x27;s crook—and give obscure clues for the underclass women who were to find it.

At the end of Crook Week was Senior March. When the chimes struck thirteen, if the underclass women did not find the crook, the seniors march on them, getting them out of their rooms and onto Main Quad where they would have a shaving cream and water balloon battle. If the underclass women found the crook, they were safe that year. This tradition ended in the 1990s because the administration considered it hazing.

=== Life Raft Debate ===
The Life Raft Debate is an annual event sponsored by the Philosophy Club. The debate has occurred each fall semester since 1998, on the second Thursday in October during the university&#x27;s Founders&#x27; Day commemoration.

In the Life Raft Debate, the audience is asked to imagine that there has been a nuclear war and that they, as the survivors, are setting sail to rebuild society from the ground up. There are a group of professors vying to win the coveted Oar and get on the raft, and only one seat is left. Each professor has to argue that his or her discipline is the one indispensable area of study that the new civilization will need to flourish.
Each professor gets to give an introductory account of his or her discipline then a brief rebuttal to the others. At the end of the debate, the audience votes and the lucky winner claims the Oar and climbs aboard, waving goodbye to the others. Often, a seventh participant, the Devil&#x27;s Advocate, appears and tries to convince the audience that the entire panel is unworthy and that all should be left behind to drown. In the following year, the defending champion faces five new challengers in a new debate. To date, no one has successfully defended the Oar.

The first event was held in 1998 before an audience of roughly 200 people. Michael Sterner of the Mathematics Department carried the day with an impassioned defense of his discipline, touting both its usefulness and beauty and promising that, if he were to be saved, there would be &quot;no more word problems ever.&quot; In the subsequent years the debate&#x27;s popularity grew to attract more than 800 audience members per year. Following years saw victories by professors from a variety of academic disciplines.

On March 12, 2010, the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot; ran a story on the Life Raft Debate entitled &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Spank the Academy.&quot; The story followed the events of the 2007 Life Raft Debate in which the Devil&#x27;s Advocate, Jon Smith, a professor in the Department of English, successfully argued that all the panelists should be drowned because they were merely trying to be funny, not to educate or to defend the importance of their respective disciplines. Following the broadcast, several colleges and universities in the United States and abroad began hosting Life Raft Debates of their own.

==Campus resources==
===James Wylie Shepherd Observatory===
The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory at the University of Montevallo was opened in the Fall of 2009. The observatory was built on the site of a former construction landfill, now remade into Gentry Springs field. The observatory is a U of M sustainability landmark.

The observatory is located roughly three miles from the main campus on the 150-acre Gentry Springs site owned by the university. The JWSO is capable of astronomical telescopic observation and astrophotography, has a dedicated telescope for solar viewing, and is one of very few observatories in the country that is designed specifically to be completely accessible to people of all disabilities.

Besides its observing capabilities, the JWSO will be a green facility, employing self-composting toilets, filtered rainwater and solar-generated electricity. The facility is currently used by UM classes, the Montevallo Astronomical Society, AMSTI partners and a variety of area K-12 classes and other local groups. There are also regularly-scheduled public viewing nights that are free of charge.

Upon completion, the observing complex will house an outdoor planetarium/amphitheater, a docent&#x27;s cabin, walking trails, a digital indoor planetarium, a visiting scholar&#x27;s dormitory, educational exhibits and a visitors&#x27; center in which groups can see images generated by the main telescope. Additional smaller scopes for solar and planetary observing can be set up at various locations outside the main dome, which is surrounded by solar-powered outdoor low-level lighting.

===Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve===
The University of Montevallo&#x27;s Ebenezer Swamp consists of approximately of wooded wetlands and is located on near the headwaters of Spring Creek, approximately northeast of the University in central Alabama.

Spring Creek and Ebenezer Swamp form a portion of the headwaters for the ecologically diverse and environmentally sensitive Cahaba River Watershed. The Cahaba is the longest remaining free-flowing river, has more species of fish per mile than any river in North America and is one of eight river biodiversity hotspots in the U.S.

UM is creating the Ebenezer Swamp Wetlands Interpretive and Research Center (ESWIRC) to focus greater research on wetland ecology and to increase educational opportunities for high school and middle school students from across the state of Alabama. Research goals center on: establishing and maintaining an inventory of plant, animal and fungal species; monitoring water quality, rainfall and stream flow rates; and future studies of wetland ecological processes and the effects of encroachment along the swamp margin. Education goals center on raising the profile of the ecologic importance of wetlands to high school and middle school students, while simultaneously providing them with a sound introduction to the underlying principles of biology.

===ValloCycle: Montevallo Bike-Share Program===
Formed through a collaborative partnership between the City of Montevallo and the University of Montevallo, the ValloCycle Bike-Share Program exists as a citywide initiative to enhance overall community walkability and individual citizen engagement with a lifestyle of sustainable, alternative transportation. The ValloCycle Bike-Share Program&#x27;s primary means of achieving these goals is through its day-to-day operation of the ValloCycle Bike-Share Program, the first county-wide bicycle sharing program in the state of Alabama to offer low-cost bicycle rentals to all the members of its community.

Unlike other nearby campus bike-share programs, ValloCycle bicycle rentals are not limited solely to university students and are also not confined to one location. Rather, bicycle rentals are offered to all residents of Montevallo and the surrounding Shelby County area in three separate check-out locations. Annual membership fees amount to roughly $2 a month for adults and $1 a month per child.

The all-volunteer ValloCycle Board oversees the implementation of a number of other campus and community programs, events, resources and public bicyclist/pedestrian infrastructure enhancements, including the Montevallo &quot;Share the Lane&quot; Initiative, the ValloCycle Town Map Project, and the Montevallo &quot;Tour By Bike&quot;. Membership forms are available at ValloCycle&#x27;s public website, vallocycle.com.

===Anagama Kiln===
Montevallo&#x27;s kiln was hand-built by the ceramics professor Scott Meyer and students beginning in 1999.
Fired once or twice a year, the kiln fires for 100 hours and consumes up to 14 cords of split wood.

===Carmichael Library===
Named for Alabama College President Oliver Cromwell Carmichael, the current library opened in 1968 at the corner of Highland and Bloch Streets. The facility features three floors of stacks, meeting spaces, and campus amenities such as the Anna Crawford Milner Archives and Special Collections, the Pat Scales Special Collection Room, the Digital Media Lab, Learning Enrichment Center and the Information Services and Technology Helpdesk. As of 2022, Carmichael Hall houses over 185,000 print titles.

===Greek life===
There are several fraternities and sororities on campus.

===Disc golf course===
In 2007, The University of Montevallo, in cooperation with the Professional Disc Golf Association, built a full size, 18 hole, disc golf course on the grounds of the campus. At the time of its construction it was one of the few courses located on the campus of a public university in the region. Despite the fact that it is on university grounds and maintained by school staff. it is open to the public and has provided a source of cooperation and connection between the community and the school. In recent years several University of Montevallo Greek organizations have sponsored various holes in order to help with maintenance and upkeep.

==Athletics==

The University of Montevallo fields 20 NCAA Division II athletic teams that currently compete in the Gulf South Conference.

Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, soccer, golf, lacrosse, tennis, track, cross-country and Wrestling. Women&#x27;s sports include lacrosse, basketball, soccer, golf, cross-country, tennis, volleyball and track and field. The Falcons were members of the Gulf South Conference from 1995 until 2009. They then competed in the Peach Belt Conference until re-joining the GSC before the 2017–18 academic year.

<text>The Indian-head test pattern is a test card that gained widespread adoption during the black-and-white television broadcasting era as an aid in the calibration of television equipment. It features a drawing of a Native American wearing a headdress surrounded by numerous graphic elements designed to test different aspects of broadcast display. The card was created by RCA to be the standard image for their TK-1 monoscope, a simple video camera capable of producing only the image embedded within it. The pattern was introduced in 1939 and over the following two decades became a fixture of television broadcast across North America in 525-line resolution and (often in modified form) abroad in 525- and 625-line resolution until it was made obsolete by the rise of color television in the 1960s.

== Features and use ==

The Indian-head test pattern was created by RCA at their factory in Harrison, New Jersey. Each element of the card was designed to measure a specific technical aspect of television broadcast so that an experienced engineer could, at a glance, identify problems. The card contains elements used to measure aspect ratio, perspective, framing, linearity, frequency response, differential gain, contrast, and brightness. The grid and circles were used for perspective, framing and linearity. The tapered lines (marked with 20, 25, 30, and 35) were used for resolution and frequency response. The thin lines marked from 575 to 325 on one side and 300 to 50 on the other side referred to lines of resolution. The gray bands emerging from the center off to the lower right and upper left were for differential gain, contrast, and white level.

The pattern began with the Indian-head portrait created in August 1938 by an artist named Brooks using pencil, charcoal, ink and zinc oxide. For about a year, the portrait (which contains several identifiable shades of gray from Zone VIII texture in the white feathers to Zone II texture in the black hair) was the entire test pattern, but in 1939 the portrait was incorporated into the current pattern of calibrated lines and shapes.

Television stations would produce the image of the Indian-head test pattern in two ways. First, they would use a monoscope in which the pattern was permanently embedded, which was capable of producing the image with a high degree of consistency due to the device&#x27;s simplicity. The monoscope tube is constructed similarly to a small cathode-ray tube (CRT), but instead of displaying an image, it scans a built-in image, producing a video signal. The tube has a perfectly proportioned copy of the test pattern master art (or a modified variant with the station ID replacing the Indian-head portrait, such as those used by KRLD-TV, WBAP-TV and WKY-TV) inside, permanently deposited as a carbon image on an aluminum target plate or slide. The target plate is sequentially scanned with a focused beam of electrons, which were originally called &quot;cathode rays&quot;. When the electron beam strikes the carbon image areas, the carbon resists current flow, and the resulting lower electron current flow is adjusted to appear as video black. When the electron beam strikes the metallic-aluminum image areas, there is less resistance with higher current flow, and the resulting higher electron current flow is adjusted to appear as video white. This image was used to calibrate monitors in the station. Second, stations would use a cardboard-mounted lithograph of the test pattern (typically attached to a rolling easel in each TV studio); videographing the lithograph would create a second image that could be compared against the monoscope-created control image.

The test pattern was useful for the calibration of home television sets as well as television studio equipment, so the image was routinely broadcast outside hours of programming. (It was often accompanied by an audio test tone for the purposes of calibrating aural system frequency response measurements.)

== As a cultural icon ==
From the late 1950s the test pattern gradually began to be seen less frequently, after fewer sign-offs, on fewer stations, and for shorter periods in the morning, since new and improved TV broadcast equipment required less adjusting. In later years the test pattern was transmitted for as little as a minute after sign-off while the transmitter engineer logged required Federal Communications Commission-US/Board of Broadcast Governors transmitter readings before cutting power.

The Indian-head test pattern became obsolete in the 1960s with the debut of color television; from that point onward, an alternate test card of SMPTE color bars (and its immediate predecessors), or colorized versions of the NBC/CBS-derived &quot;bullseye&quot; patterns became the test card of choice. Since the 1990s, most television stations in the United States have broadcast continuously without regular sign-offs, instead running infomercials, networked overnight news shows, syndicated reruns, cartoons, or old movies; thus, the broadcast of test patterns has become mostly obsolete (though they are still used in post-production and broadcast facilities to check color and signal paths).

Nevertheless, the Indian-head test pattern persists as a symbol of early television. Many U.S. television stations chose the image of the Indian-head card to be their final image broadcast when their analog signals signed off for the final time between February 17 and June 12, 2009, as part of the digital television transition in the United States.

A variant of the card appeared on the Canadian sketch comedy show Second City Television in the late-1970s, and another variant appeared on theatrical release posters for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;UHF&quot;. Some Pioneer GGV1069 LaserDisc reference discs released for the NTSC market included a variant of the card, but modified with a gray-colored grid and a drawing of a Japanese lion-dog replacing the Indian-head portrait. It was sold as a night-light from 1997 to 2005 by the Archie McPhee company, reminiscent of the times when a fairly common late-night experience was to fall asleep while watching the late movie, only to awaken to the characteristic sine wave tone accompanying the Indian-head test pattern on a black-and-white TV screen. The test card also featured in the opening sequence of the early 1960s science fiction anthology &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;.

===Artifacts===
Nearly all of the hard-to-open, steel-shielded monoscope tubes were junked with their Indian-head test pattern target plates still inside, but many of the board-mounted lithographs survive.

The master art for both the portrait and the pattern design was discovered in a dumpster by a wrecking crew worker as the old RCA factory in Harrison, New Jersey was being demolished in 1970. The worker kept the art for over 30 years before selling it to a collector.

== International variants ==

The Indian head was also used by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Canada in conjunction with its own monochrome test pattern, following the Canadian national anthem sign-off in the evening, and during its final years in the late-1970s and early-1980s it was shown before sign-on in the morning, after the showing of the SMPTE color bars.

In Thailand it was used by Thai TV Channel 4 when Thailand used the 525-line system.

It was also used by Rhodesia Television (RTV) during British colonial times (varying between Northern and Southern Rhodesia) following the playing of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; at closedown.

This test pattern was later used by the Venezuelan TV channel Venevisión, in conjunction with the RMA Resolution Chart 1946, until the late-1970s before signing on with the Venezuelan national anthem. Telesistema Mexicano (now Televisa) stations also used this test pattern until the late-1960s immediately after playing the Mexican national anthem at sign-off.

In the Dominican Republic, the Indian-head pattern was used by its public broadcaster Corporación Estatal de Radio y Televisión (CERTV) in the late-1960s and 1970s (in conjunction with the EIA 1956 resolution chart test card) after playing the National Anthem of the Dominican Republic at sign-off.
In Sweden, the Indian-head test pattern was used in test transmissions from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm alongside the RMA Resolution Chart 1946, Telefunken T05 test card, as well as other experimental test cards from Televerket and Chalmers University of Technology from 1948 until November 1958 when it was replaced by the Sveriges Radio TV (now Sveriges Television) test card.

In Australia, the Indian-head test pattern was used by TNT-9 in Northern Tasmania in conjunction with the Marconi Resolution Chart No. 1 from its launch in 1962 until it adopted colour television in the mid-1970s. This version eschewed the Indian head drawing with the TNT-9 station ID on top, similar to the aforementioned KRLD-TV, WBAP-TV and WKY-TV variants.

Saudi Broadcasting Authority in Saudi Arabia also formerly used a modified version of the Indian-head test pattern, with the Emblem of Saudi Arabia replacing the Indian head drawing, from 1954 until 1982 when it was replaced with a heavily modified Philips PM5544 test card.

The Indian head was also used in Brazil by Rede Tupi, both as a test pattern and as part of a television ident, from its launch in 1950 until it became the first Brazilian television network to adopt colour television in 1971–72.

The Indian head pattern was also used by Kuwait Television in Kuwait from its launch of television services in 1961 until it adopted colour television in the mid-1970s.

In Italy, the pattern was adapted and modified by RAI for its monochrome test cards, used from 1961 to 1977. There were two versions during most of its existence, one with a large N for Programma Nazionale and another with a large 2 for Secondo Programma. By 1976, the N was replaced by a 1 and was made smaller (the same happened to the second network&#x27;s 2).

<doc id="1156191" wikidata="Q612362" url="?curid=1156191" title="Captain Jack (group)">
<text>Captain Jack is an American-German Eurodance and dance-rock project formed in Darmstadt in 1995. The project is best known for its single &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, which reached the top 10 in many countries in Europe.

== History and career ==

===1995: Career beginnings===
The original group consisted of Sharky Durban and Liza da Costa. They recorded the songs &quot;Dam, Dam, Dam&quot; and &quot;Captain Jack&quot;. The latter is the only song featured on the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Mission&quot;.

===1995–1998: Second lineup, &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;Operation Dance&quot;===
Sharky left the group and was replaced by Francisco Gutierrez alias Franky Gee. 

Gutierrez and Liza da Costa released the albums &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;Operation Dance&quot; and the singles &quot;Drill Instructor&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot; before Liza da Costa left in December 1998, forming a jazz band called Hotel Bossa Nova in 2005.

===1999–2000: Third lineup and &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Revenge&quot;===
Liza da Costa was replaced by the singer Maria Lucia Lozanes who went by the stage name Maloy. In this formation they released one album, called &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, and the three singles: &quot;Dream a Dream&quot;, &quot;Get Up&quot; with the Gipsy Kings, and &quot;Only You&quot; before Maloy left in November 2000.

===2001–2005: Fourth and fifth lineups, Franky Gee&#x27;s death and hiatus===
Maloy was replaced by Ilka Anna Antonia Traue, alias Illi Love, who stayed until 2005. In this formation they released the five albums &quot;Top Secret&quot;, &quot;Party Warriors&quot;, &quot;Cafe Cubar&quot;, &quot;Music Instructor&quot; and their first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; totaling eleven single up to the release of &quot;Capitano&quot;, which by this point Illi Love was replaced by Sabine Repas. Soon after, Franky suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while walking with his son in Spain on 17 October 2005. Doctors predicted that the damage was fatal, and Franky Gee died at the age of 43 on Saturday 22 October 2005, after spending five days in a coma. The producers paused the project.

===2008–2009: Reunion, new lineup, and &quot;Captain Jack is Back&quot;===
The Captain Jack name was revived in summer of 2008 with Bruce Lacy and singer Jamie Lee. The new lineup&#x27;s first single, &quot;Turkish Bazar&quot;, released on 18 September 2008, was of the dance-pop and hip hop genres, dropping the original lineup&#x27;s eurodance roots. It was followed by the album &quot;Captain Jack is Back&quot;, released on 17 October 2008, and two more singles &quot;Push It Up&quot; and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; before Captain Jack and Jamie Lee parted ways.

===2010–present: Seventh lineup, &quot;Back to the Dancefloor&quot;, and Illi Love&#x27;s return===
In 2010 Laura Martin, participant of the fourth installment of &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the German version of Pop Idol, and the first season of &quot;The Voice of Germany&quot;, joined Bruce Lacy and replaced Jamie Lee. They released the album &quot;Back to the Dancefloor&quot; in April 2011, which featured Captain Jack classics in new DJ remixes with new songs. The album was followed by three singles &quot;Crank It Up/Deutschland schieß ein Tor&quot;, &quot;People Like to Party&quot; and &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;. In the end of 2012 Laura left the band to focus in her solo career. Michelle Stanley replaced her, and toured with Bruce Lacy until 2020.

Throughout 2020 and 2021, Bruce Lacy continued to appear as a featured artist on a number of tracks, credited as Captain Jack. In 2021, he released &quot;Summersun&quot;, a collaboration with former Mr. President member LayZee and Illi Love, one of the vocalists from Franky Gee&#x27;s era.

==Musical style==
Captain Jack&#x27;s music was stylized as a form of military training mixed with Europop, dance-rock and dance pop music. They were musically influenced by the eurodance genre that was popular in Europe, Oceania, and South America in the 1990s. The style of eurodance was dance music with a female singer and a male rapper to follow a traditional verse-chorus structure. Captain Jack are best known for dance tracks like &quot;Captain Jack&quot;, &quot;Drill Instructor&quot; or &quot;Little Boy&quot;, although they also made slower tracks such as &quot;Back Home&quot;, &quot;7 Days&quot; and &quot;I Feel&quot; that strayed from the europop genre. There are also some Ace of Base influenced reggae pop songs like &quot;Soldier, Soldier&quot; on their early albums. Captain Jack covered numerous songs such as A-ha&#x27;s &quot;Take On Me&quot;, Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; or Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Holiday&quot;. They also sampled classical elements like Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; in their dance song &quot;Dream a Dream&quot; or Johann Pachabel&#x27;s &quot;Canon in D major&quot; in their ballad &quot;Children&quot;. During the early 2000s Captain Jack changed their musical style from eurodance pop to summer vibe tunes, following the styles of the previous single releases &quot;Soldier, Soldier&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot;. They covered numerous well-known famous summer songs, such as Chico Buarque&#x27;s &quot;A Banda&quot; (in their version, &quot;Get Up&quot;), Captain Sensible&#x27;s &quot;Say Captain, Say Wot&quot;, Huey Smith &amp; His Clowns&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Just Know It (Don&#x27;t Ha Ha)&quot; or KC and the Sunshine Band&#x27;s &quot;Give It Up&quot;. They continued that style til the band&#x27;s hiatus in 2005. In 2008 Captain Jack returned with the song &quot;Turkish Bazar&quot;.

==Other endeavours==
Fans of the Konami arcade game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; know them from the numerous songs that, through the Dancemania series of albums, have been used in the game series. The group&#x27;s music was also featured in other Konami music games such as &quot;beatmania&quot; and &quot;Dance Maniax&quot;.

Their songs &quot;Children&quot; and &quot;Children Need a Helping Hand&quot;, collaborations with Hand in Children e.V., a supergroup charity collective, were released in 1996 and 1997.

<doc id="1156215" wikidata="Q860615" url="?curid=1156215" title="Helmholtz equation">
<text>In mathematics, the Helmholtz equation is the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator. It corresponds to the elliptic partial differential equation:
formula_1
where is the Laplace operator, is the eigenvalue, and is the (eigen)function. When the equation is applied to waves, is known as the wave number. The Helmholtz equation has a variety of applications in physics and other sciences, including the wave equation, the diffusion equation, and the Schrödinger equation for a free particle.

In optics, the Helmholtz equation is the wave equation for the electric field.

The equation is named after Hermann von Helmholtz, who studied it in 1860.

==Motivation and uses==

The Helmholtz equation often arises in the study of physical problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) in both space and time. The Helmholtz equation, which represents a time-independent form of the wave equation, results from applying the technique of separation of variables to reduce the complexity of the analysis.

For example, consider the wave equation
formula_2

Separation of variables begins by assuming that the wave function is in fact separable:
formula_3

Substituting this form into the wave equation and then simplifying, we obtain the following equation:
formula_4

Notice that the expression on the left side depends only on , whereas the right expression depends only on . As a result, this equation is valid in the general case if and only if both sides of the equation are equal to the same constant value. This argument is key in the technique of solving linear partial differential equations by separation of variables. From this observation, we obtain two equations, one for , the other for 
formula_5
formula_6

where we have chosen, without loss of generality, the expression for the value of the constant. (It is equally valid to use any constant as the separation constant; is chosen only for convenience in the resulting solutions.)

Rearranging the first equation, we obtain the (homogeneous) Helmholtz equation:
formula_7

Likewise, after making the substitution , where is the wave number, and is the angular frequency (assuming a monochromatic field), the second equation becomes

formula_8

We now have Helmholtz&#x27;s equation for the spatial variable and a second-order ordinary differential equation in time. The solution in time will be a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, whose exact form is determined by initial conditions, while the form of the solution in space will depend on the boundary conditions. Alternatively, integral transforms, such as the Laplace or Fourier transform, are often used to transform a hyperbolic PDE into a form of the Helmholtz equation.

Because of its relationship to the wave equation, the Helmholtz equation arises in problems in such areas of physics as the study of electromagnetic radiation, seismology, and acoustics.

==Solving the Helmholtz equation using separation of variables==

The solution to the spatial Helmholtz equation:
formula_9
can be obtained for simple geometries using separation of variables.

===Vibrating membrane===

The two-dimensional analogue of the vibrating string is the vibrating membrane, with the edges clamped to be motionless. The Helmholtz equation was solved for many basic shapes in the 19th century: the rectangular membrane by Siméon Denis Poisson in 1829, the equilateral triangle by Gabriel Lamé in 1852, and the circular membrane by Alfred Clebsch in 1862. The elliptical drumhead was studied by Émile Mathieu, leading to Mathieu&#x27;s differential equation.

If the edges of a shape are straight line segments, then a solution is integrable or knowable in closed-form only if it is expressible as a finite linear combination of plane waves that satisfy the boundary conditions (zero at the boundary, i.e., membrane clamped).

If the domain is a circle of radius , then it is appropriate to introduce polar coordinates and . The Helmholtz equation takes the form
formula_10

We may impose the boundary condition that vanishes if ; thus
formula_11

the method of separation of variables leads to trial solutions of the form
formula_12
where must be periodic of This leads to

formula_13
formula_14

It follows from the periodicity condition that
formula_15
and that must be an integer. The radial component has the form
formula_16
where the Bessel function satisfies Bessel&#x27;s equation
formula_17
and The radial function has infinitely many roots for each value of denoted by The boundary condition that vanishes where will be satisfied if the corresponding wavenumbers are given by
formula_18

The general solution then takes the form of a generalized Fourier series of terms involving products of and the sine (or cosine) of These solutions are the modes of vibration of a circular drumhead.

===Three-dimensional solutions===

In spherical coordinates, the solution is:

formula_19

This solution arises from the spatial solution of the wave equation and diffusion equation. Here and are the spherical Bessel functions, and are the spherical harmonics (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). Note that these forms are general solutions, and require boundary conditions to be specified to be used in any specific case. For infinite exterior domains, a radiation condition may also be required (Sommerfeld, 1949).

Writing function has asymptotics
formula_20

where function is called scattering amplitude and is the value of at each boundary point 

====Three-dimensional solutions given the function on a 2-dimensional plane====
Given a 2-dimensional plane where A is known, the solution to the Helmholtz equation is given by:
formula_21

where

* formula_22 is the solution at the 2-dimensional plane,
* formula_23

As approaches zero, all contributions from the integral vanish except for Thus formula_24 up to a numerical factor, which can be verified to be by transforming the integral to polar coordinates formula_25

This solution is important in diffraction theory, e.g. in deriving Fresnel diffraction.

==Paraxial approximation==
In the paraxial approximation of the Helmholtz equation, the complex amplitude is expressed as
formula_26
where represents the complex-valued amplitude which modulates the sinusoidal plane wave represented by the exponential factor. Then under a suitable assumption, approximately solves
formula_27
where formula_28 is the transverse part of the Laplacian.

This equation has important applications in the science of optics, where it provides solutions that describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves (light) in the form of either paraboloidal waves or Gaussian beams. Most lasers emit beams that take this form.

The assumption under which the paraxial approximation is valid is that the derivative of the amplitude function is a slowly varying function of :

formula_29

This condition is equivalent to saying that the angle between the wave vector and the optical axis is small: .

The paraxial form of the Helmholtz equation is found by substituting the above-stated expression for the complex amplitude into the general form of the Helmholtz equation as follows:

formula_30

Expansion and cancellation yields the following:

formula_31

Because of the paraxial inequality stated above, the term is neglected in comparison with the term. This yields the paraxial Helmholtz equation. Substituting then gives the paraxial equation for the original complex amplitude :

formula_32

The Fresnel diffraction integral is an exact solution to the paraxial Helmholtz equation.

==Inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation==

The inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is the equation
formula_33
where is a function with compact support, and This equation is very similar to the screened Poisson equation, and would be identical if the plus sign (in front of the term) were switched to a minus sign.

===Solution===
In order to solve this equation uniquely, one needs to specify a boundary condition at infinity, which is typically the Sommerfeld radiation condition
formula_34
in formula_35 spatial dimensions, for all angles (i.e. any value of formula_36). Here
formula_37 where formula_38 are the coordinates of the vector formula_39.

With this condition, the solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is

formula_40

(notice this integral is actually over a finite region, since has compact support). Here, is the Green&#x27;s function of this equation, that is, the solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation with equaling the Dirac delta function, so satisfies

formula_41

The expression for the Green&#x27;s function depends on the dimension of the space. One has
formula_42
for ,

formula_43
for , where is a Hankel function, and
formula_44
for . Note that we have chosen the boundary condition that the Green&#x27;s function is an outgoing wave for .

Finally, for general n,

formula_45

where formula_46 and formula_47.

<text>Rydal is an unincorporated community in Bartow County, Georgia, United States, located thirteen miles north of Cartersville.
This still predominantly rural area includes the historic town of Pine Log. The Pine Log post office is open today and the town and the surrounding area is now frequently referred to as Rydal. In 2000 the population of the greater Rydal area was 2,960. Several historic churches, homes and the Pine Log Elementary School still remain in the community. The community has experienced population growth from the continuing expansion of the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. The total number of inhabitants has risen in the past years and, since the 1990s, several subdivisions and factories have been built in the area.

<doc id="1156240" wikidata="Q969735" url="?curid=1156240" title="Juan Yagüe">
<text>Juan Yagüe y Blanco, 1st Marquis of San Leonardo de Yagüe (9 November 1891 – 21 October 1952) was a Spanish military officer during the Spanish Civil War, one of the most important in the Nationalist side. He became known as the &quot;Butcher of Badajoz&quot; (&quot;Carnicero de Badajoz&quot;) because he ordered thousands killed, including wounded Republican soldiers in the hospital.

==Early life==

The son of a doctor, he enrolled at a young age in the Toledo Infantry Academy, where Francisco Franco was a fellow cadet. The two men received their commissions concurrently and served together in Africa, where Yagüe was wounded on several occasions and received several decorations.

Yagüe was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1932. He, along with Franco and General Eduardo López Ochoa, helped suppress a workers uprising in Asturias using Moroccan Regulars and Legionnaires in 1934. He was a strong early supporter of the Falange Española and a close personal friend of José Antonio Primo de Rivera.

==Spanish Civil War==

When Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was replaced as President of the Republic by the left-wing Manuel Azaña on 10 May 1936, a group of Spanish Army officers, including Yagüe, Emilio Mola, Franco, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano and José Sanjurjo, started plotting to overthrow the democratically elected Popular Front government. This led to a military uprising which precipitated the Spanish Civil War on 17 July 1936.

Yagüe&#x27;s forces revolted in Ceuta before crossing the Straits of Gibraltar to link up with Nationalist forces in Seville, led by Queipo de Llano. Yagüe advanced northward, first seizing Mérida before attacking Badajoz with 3,000 troops on 14 August 1936. Bitter street fighting took place when the Nationalists advanced into the city. Yagüe&#x27;s forces eventually gained control of Badajoz, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

Under Yagüe&#x27;s direction, hundreds of prisoners, military and civilians, were killed or executed in Badajoz during the Badajoz massacre. 

Before leaving the city, Yagüe was asked by the American journalist John T. Whitaker about his reason for killing 10% of the city&#x27;s population and he answered: 

Yagüe was then promoted to colonel and afterwards advanced on Madrid, capturing Trujillo, Navalmoral de la Mata and Talavera de la Reina, but was unable to take the capital. He took part in the Aragon Offensive and seized control of Belchite, Caspe and Lérida. He also played a leading role in the Nationalist victory at the Ebro. In May 1938, Yagüe was removed from his command and imprisoned for injudicious remarks he made in a speech at Burgos, critical of Franco. He was back at the front within weeks. It was reportedly said that he was the only commander of Spanish forces that the Condor Legion respected. Yagüe never showed panic even when the enemy was close by, and was able to adjust battle plans quickly to suit changing circumstances.
==Post-war==
After the collapse of the Second Spanish Republic in 1939, Yagüe was promoted to major-general and appointed as Minister of the Air Force by General Franco. He was made a lieutenant general in 1942 and was posthumously promoted to commander-in-chief. He died of lung cancer in 1952.

<text>David Michael Orazietti (born 12 November 1968) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2016 who represented the northern Ontario riding of Sault Ste. Marie. He served in the cabinet of Kathleen Wynne, most recently as Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, until he resigned on 31 December 2016. His resignation became effective 1 January 2017. In January 2017, Orazietti was appointed Dean of Aviation, Trades and Technology, Natural Environment and Business at Sault College.

==Background==
Orazietti is a third-generation resident of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. He worked as a teacher for the Algoma District School Board for ten years. He and his wife Jane live in Sault Ste. Marie with their two children.

==Politics==
In 1997, Orazietti was elected to Sault Ste. Marie City Council in Ward One. He was re-elected to a second term in 2000.

He ran in the provincial election of 2003 as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Sault Ste. Marie. He defeated New Democratic incumbent Tony Martin by 8,671 votes. He was re-elected in the 2007, 2011, and 2014 elections, becoming the first MPP in the riding&#x27;s history to be re-elected three times.

During his time in government Orazietti held several Parliamentary Assistant roles supporting ministers of cabinet including Minister of Natural Resources (2005-2007, 2009-2011) and Minister of Northern Development and Mines (2007-2009). He also served as Government Caucus Chair and parliamentary assistant to premier Dalton McGuinty from 2011 to 2013.

During his tenure, he brought forward several Private member bills to improve such things as the Northern Health Travel Grant and expansion of Highway 17.

On 11 February 2013, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed him to cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources. On 24 June 2014, Wynne appointed him to a second ministry, this time as Minister of Government and Consumer Services.

On 27 May 2015 Orazietti introduced a new bill called Protecting Condominium Owners Act, 2015. The bill called for the creation of a new Condominium Authority that would facilitate dispute resolution between owners and boards. There would also be training and licensing of condominium management companies. Critics of the bill said that the bill would result in increased fees and more special assessments. It was passed into law on 3 December 2015.

On 13 June 2016, Wynne appointed Orazietti as Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services. He resigned from cabinet on 16 December 2016 and announced his resignation as an MPP effective 1 January 2017.

==After politics==
Orazietti was appointed Dean of Aviation, Trades and Technology, Natural Environment and Business at Sault College in January 2017.

<text>Heinrich Heesch (June 25, 1906 – July 26, 1995) was a German mathematician. He was born in Kiel and died in Hanover.

In Göttingen, he worked on Group theory. In 1933, Heesch witnessed the National Socialist purges of university staff. Not willing to become a member of the National Socialist organization of university teachers as required, he resigned from his university position in 1935 and worked privately at his parents&#x27; home in Kiel until 1948.

During this time, he did research on tilings. In 1955, Heesch began teaching at Leibniz University Hannover and worked on graph theory. In this period, Heesch did pioneering work in developing methods for a computer-aided proof of the then unproved four color theorem. In particular, he was the first to investigate the notion of &quot;discharging&quot;, which turned out to be a fundamental ingredient of the eventual computer-aided proof by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken.

Between 1967 and 1971, Heesch made several visits to the United States, where bigger and faster computers were available, working with Haken at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  and with Karl Durre and Yoshio Shimamoto at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
During the crucial phase of his project, the German national research fund DFG cancelled financial support. After the 1977 success of Appel and Haken, Heesch worked on refining and shortening their proof, even after his retirement.
