<text>Design–bid–build (or design/bid/build, and abbreviated D–B–B or D/B/B accordingly), also known as Design–tender (or &quot;design/tender&quot;), traditional method, or hardbid, is a project delivery method in which the agency or owner contracts with separate entities for the design and construction of a project.

Design–bid–build is the traditional method for project delivery and differs in several substantial aspects from design–build.

There are three main sequential phases to the design–bid–build delivery method:

*The design phase
*The bidding (or tender) phase
*The construction phase

== Design phase ==
In this phase, the owner retains an architect (or consulting engineer for infrastructure works) to design and produce bid documents, including construction drawings and technical specifications, on which various general contractors will in turn bid to construct the project. For building projects, the architect will work with the owner to identify the owner&#x27;s needs, develop a written program documenting those needs and then produce a conceptual and/or schematic design. This early design is then developed, and the architect will usually bring in other design professionals including a structural engineer, sometimes a civil engineer, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineers (&quot;MEP engineers&quot;), a fire protection engineer and often a landscape architect to help complete the construction drawings and technical specifications. The finished bid documents are coordinated by the architect and owner for issuance to general contractors during the bid phase.

Design fees are typically between 5-10% of the total project cost.

== Bid (or tender) phase ==

Bidding can be &quot;open&quot;, in which any qualified bidder may participate, or &quot;select&quot;, in which a limited number of pre-selected contractors are invited to bid.

The various general contractors bidding on the project obtain copies of the bid (or tender) documents, and then put them out to multiple subcontractors for bids on sub-components of the project. Sub-components include items such as the concrete work, structural steel frame, electrical systems, HVAC, and landscaping. Questions may arise during the bid (or tender) period, and the architect will typically issue clarifications or corrections to the bid documents in the form of addenda. From these elements, the contractor compiles a complete bid (or &quot;tender price&quot;) for submission by the established closing date and time (i.e., bid date). Bids can be based on the quantities of materials in the completed construction (e.g., as in the UK with bills of quantities), the operations needed to build it (e.g., as in operational bills), or simply as a lump sum cost; however, these bid requirements are elucidated within the bid documents.
Once bids are received, the architect typically reviews the bids, seeks any clarifications required of the bidders, investigates contractor qualifications, ensures all documentation is in order (including bonding if required), and advises the owner as to the ranking of the bids. If the bids fall in a range acceptable to the owner, the owner and architect discuss the suitability of various bidders and their proposals. The owner is not obligated to accept the lowest bid, and it is customary for other factors including past performance and quality of other work to influence the selection process. However, the project is typically awarded to the general contractor with the lowest bid.

In the event that all of the bids do not satisfy the needs of the owner, whether for financial reasons or otherwise, the owner may choose to reject all bids. The following options become available to the owner:
*Re-bid (or re-tender) the construction of the project on a future date when the owner&#x27;s needs are met, such as when money becomes available and/or construction costs go down.
*Abandon the project entirely.
*Issue a work order to have the architect revise the design (sometimes at no cost to the Owner, if previously negotiated), so as to make the project smaller or more efficient, or reduce features or elements of the project to bring the cost down. The revised bid documents can then be issued again for bid (or re-tendered).
*Select a general contractor, such as the lowest bidder, or an experienced cost estimator to assist the architect with design changes aimed at cost reduction. This process is often referred to as value engineering. The revised bid documents can then be issued again for bid (or re-tendered).

== Construction phase ==
Once the construction of the project has been awarded to the contractor, the bid documents (e.g., approved construction drawings and technical specifications) may not be altered. The necessary permits (for example, a building permit) must be achieved from all jurisdictional authorities in order for the construction process to begin. Should design changes be necessary during construction, whether initiated by the contractor, owner, or as discovered by the architect, the architect may issue sketches or written clarifications. The contractor may be required to document &quot;as built&quot; conditions to the owner.

In most instances, nearly every component of a project is supplied and installed by sub-contractors. The general contractor may provide work with its own forces, but it is common for a general contractor to limit its role primarily to managing the construction process and daily activity on a construction site (see also construction management).

During the construction phase the architect also acts as the owner&#x27;s agent to review the progress of the work as it relates to pay requests from the Contractor, and to issue site instructions, change orders (or field orders), or other documentation necessary to facilitate the construction process and certify that the project is built to the approved construction drawings.

== Potential problems of design–bid–build ==
*Failure of the design team to retain current familiarity with construction costs, and any potential cost increases during the design phase could cause project delays if the construction documents must be redone to reduce costs.
*Redesign expense can be disputed should the architect&#x27;s contract not specifically address the issue of revisions required to reduce costs.
*Development of a &quot;cheaper is better&quot; mentality amongst the general contractors bidding the project so there is the tendency to seek out the lowest cost sub-contractors in a given market. In strong markets, general contractors will be able to be selective about which projects to bid, but in lean times, the desire for work usually forces the low bidder of each trade to be selected. This usually results in increased risk (for the general contractor) and can also compromise the quality of construction. In the extreme, it can lead to serious disputes involving quality of the final product, or bankruptcy of a sub-contractor who was on the brink of insolvency desperate for work.
*As the general contractor is brought to the team post-design, there is little opportunity for input on effective alternates being presented. 
*Pressures may be exerted on the design and construction teams due to competing interests (e.g., economy versus acceptable quality), which may lead to disputes between the architect and the general contractor, and associated delays in construction.

==Benefits of design–bid–build ==
*The design team looks out for the interests of the owner. 
*The design team prepares documents on which all general contractors place bids. With this in mind, the &quot;cheaper is better&quot; argument is rendered invalid since the bids are based on complete documents. Incomplete, incorrect or missed items are usually discovered and addressed during the bid process in the form of addenda.
*Ensures fairness to potential bidders and improves decision making by the owner by providing a range of potential options. It also identifies new potential contractors.
*Assists the owner in establishing reasonable prices for the project. 
*Uses competition both in the selection of the architect and the contractor to improve the efficiency and quality for owners.

<doc id="1182284" wikidata="Q17049133" url="?curid=1182284" title="Rail transport in Victoria">
<text>Rail transport in the Australian state of Victoria is provided by a number of railway operators who operate over the government-owned railway lines. The network consists of 2,357 km of Victorian broad gauge () lines, and 1,912 km of standard gauge () freight and interstate lines; the latter increasing with gauge conversion of the former. Historically, a few experimental gauge lines were built, along with various private logging, mining and industrial railways. The rail network radiates from the state capital, Melbourne, with main interstate links to Sydney and to Adelaide, as well as major lines running to regional centres, upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project and the Regional Rail Revival project. 

The government-owned VicTrack owns all railway and tram lines, associated rail lands and other rail-related infrastructure in Victoria, which it leases to Public Transport Victoria which then sublets assets and infrastructure as appropriate to rail and tram operators. The state has four railway networks: 

* Metro Trains Melbourne operates Melbourne&#x27;s electrified metropolitan network providing passenger services with electric multiple units,

* V/Line operates the country passenger network with diesel trains, 

* Australian Rail Track Corporation leases from VicTrack the standard gauge tracks from Melbourne to Albury and to Serviceton to operate the interstate Melbourne-Adelaide and Melbourne-Sydney services, and 

* the grain network in the north west of the state, connected to the ports at Geelong and Portland. Freight services are operated by Southern Shorthaul Railroad, Pacific National and SCT Logistics (interstate and intrastate), and Qube Logistics (intrastate). 

Victoria does not have a dominant mining base as with other states, and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for rail freight traffic. By the 1990s road transport had captured most general freight traffic, with an average of only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried each year between 1996 and 1998; containers being the major cargo, followed by cement, logs, quarry products and steel.

== History ==
The first railway lines in Victoria were built in the 1850s, and were privately owned and operated. These started having financial problems and were taken over by the Government Railway Department (Victorian Railways), which was established by the Colonial Government and became a vertically integrated government service. This structure remained until corporatisation began in the 1970s, followed by privatisation in the 1990s. 

The rail network reached a peak in 1942 but steadily declined, as branch and cross country lines were closed until the 1980s.

===First lines===

Australia&#x27;s first steam-operated railway was a broad gauge line between the Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station) and Sandridge (now Port Melbourne). It was constructed by the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854. The first country line in Victoria was from Melbourne to Geelong, which was opened in 1857 by the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company. In the early years, the lines were constructed by private companies.

The suburban network expanded to the east from Princes Bridge to Richmond in 1859, then later to Brighton and Hawthorn by the early 1860s. The initial suburban lines were all built by different private companies centred on Flinders Street, which amalgamated into the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay United Railway Company by 1865; public ownership did not occur until 1878. In 1862, Victorian Railways lines had reached the great gold rush towns of Bendigo and Ballarat, and in 1864, railways were extended to the Murray River port of Echuca. In the 1870s, the Government Railway Department (Victorian Railways) started to build its own lines.

In 1883, the first connection to another colony&#x27;s rail system was made, when the Albury-Wodonga line was completed to join the New South Wales Government Railways network at Albury, requiring a break-of-gauge to New South Wales&#x27; (standard gauge). It was then followed in 1887 by a connection with the broad gauge South Australian Railways at Serviceton, with the &quot;Intercolonial Express&quot; (now &quot;The Overland&quot;) to Adelaide running between the capitals. Additional trunk lines were also built though the 1870s, with rails extended to Sale, Portland and Colac; and the first branch lines built. It was a time of improved train safety, with the first interlocking of railway signalling to protect trains provided in 1874, and tests of continuous train brakes carried out in 1884.

In 1884, Colonial Parliament passed &quot;The Railway Construction Act&quot;, which authorised fifty-nine new lines to almost every corner of the colony, and thus became known as the &quot;Octopus Act&quot;. The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural towns and support suburban land speculation. It was also this decade that the first narrow gauge line was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield, with three other lines following by 1910. The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891. However, by the late 1890s, the majority of the colony was now covered in railways, with the exception of the Mallee country in the north west of the colony which saw further line openings, such as the Mildura line in 1903.

===A new century===
In 1907, the A2 class steam locomotive was introduced. There were 185 locomotives in this class, and they were Victorian Railway&#x27;s main passenger locomotive until the arrival of the diesel-electric B class in 1952. On 20 April 1908, the Sunshine train disaster occurred, killing 44 passengers in the worst Victorian railway accident.

Electrification of the Melbourne suburban network was also carried out, with the first train running in 1919. By 1924, 210,000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne&#x27;s busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.

Despite World War I, significant extensions of rail lines were carried out, particularly in the wheat-growing areas in the north-west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines were considered to be cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley. By 1930, the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with several lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. In November 1937, the first run of the &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; was made, a streamlined all air-conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.

From 1924 to 1935, the Better Farming Train made 38 tours promoting improved agricultural practices.

The Victorian Railways biggest steam locomotive H 220 &quot;Heavy Harry&quot; entered service in 1941, at a time when the railways were struggling with the needs of the war effort. In 1943, the Victorian Railways employed 25,450, had 577 steam locos and 12 electric locos on register along with 19,823 goods wagons and 1,499 passenger cars, running along of lines. The network reached its largest extent in 1942, covering 7668 route kilometres.

===Post war rebuilding===

After World War II, the railways were run down, with Operation Phoenix unveiled in 1950, involving the expenditure of £80 million over 10 years. Works included electrification to Traralgon, new Harris suburban trains, the Walker railmotors, and approximately 3,000 new goods wagons.

On 14 July 1952, the VR entered the diesel era, with the delivery of the first B class mainline locomotive, with the commissioning of the first mainline electrification scheme in Australia in July 1954 to Warragul. March 1954 saw Queen Elizabeth II tour Victoria by Royal Train, the first time a reigning monarch had travelled on the VR, 1954 also saw the last steam locomotive to enter service, J class 559, as well as the last four wheeled open wagons being built. The fifties also saw the loss of a number of short branch lines, particularly country where the only traffic had been timber or livestock.

In the 1960s, the break of gauge at Albury was eliminated, with the opening of the North East standard gauge line in 1962. The new line aided freight traffic between the state capitals, and enabled through passenger trains, such as the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; and the &quot;Intercapital Daylight&quot;. At the same time, the sixties was also the end of steam, with the demolition of the massive North Melbourne Locomotive Depot on 20 January 1961.

1965 saw the Victorian Railways produce a £193,727 surplus, but by 1973, increasing costs and declining revenue resulted in a $86,086,361 deficit. On 20 July 1976, the Laverton derailment occurred, killing one passenger, in what was the last railway passenger fatality not involving a road vehicle. By the late seventies, roadside goods and country railmotor services had been replaced by road transport, and branch lines outside the grain producing areas were now virtually non-existent. The Lonie Report delivered in 1980 recommended the closure of all country passenger service except that to Geelong, elimination of a number of suburban railways, and moving small-volume freight from rail to road.

===New deal===
The 1980s saw corporatisation of the Victorian Railways carried out, with the railway commissioners replaced by VicRail and later government authorities. New liveries on trains were unveiled, as elderly &quot;red rattlers&quot; were replaced by new trains.

1981 saw the Melbourne underground loop open in January, followed by the new air conditioned Comeng suburban trains and &quot;N&quot; type country passenger carriages in September the same year. Country services were also sped up under the &quot;New Deal&quot; by the closure of 35 of small wayside stations. Country passenger services saw the last of the non-air-conditioned wooden bodied passenger cars withdrawn from service in 1986, replaced by new &quot;H&quot; set carriages. Trials were also carried out for further upgrades, with locomotive A85 re-geared for 160 km/h operation in a series of test runs between Glenorchy and Lubeck in the state&#x27;s west in July 1986. 

It was also the end of an era, with freight trains having their guards vans and guards abolished from 1985, and the carriage of livestock ended in 1986. The last run of the &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; and &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; passenger trains were also made in 1986, on 3 August. Working practices were also altered, with through working of C class locomotives introduced between Melbourne and Adelaide in 1982. Previously Victorian locomotives were detached at the state borders, and replaced by locomotives from the next state. New locomotive were also introduced, with the G and N classes enabling the retirement of many of the 1st generation diesels. 
Cuts continued to the rail network, with larger centralised silos in the north western area of the state, and replacement of traditional safeworking systems by systems that required no local staff caused further stations to be subsequently de-staffed.

===Privatisation===
The 1990s saw costs further reduced on the rail network. Guards were removed from passenger trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last suburban train crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994, the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995, removing the break of gauge.
Moves towards privatisation began in 1997, with V/Line split into V/Line Passenger and V/Line Freight and in 1998 Melbourne services operated by the Public Transport Corporation split into Bayside Trains and Hillside Trains. V/Line Freight was sold to Freight Victoria in 1999, followed by National Express taking over Bayside Trains and V/Line Passenger in 2000, with Connex Melbourne taking over Hillside Trains.

===End of private lease===
Victorian Premier Steve Bracks negotiated a premature end to the &quot;under-rail&quot; Victorian country Broad Gauge network lease just minutes before the caretaker mode began before the state election of November 2006. This cost around $125 million. In May 2008, Premier John Brumby arranged a 45-year lease to the Australian Rail Track Corporation of the single track Seymour-Albury section. Part of the negotiation involved Victoria contributing money for the track to be upgraded and standardised and for Wodonga to be bypassed.

Today, the state consists of four networks: the electrified metropolitan system operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, the country passenger network operated by V/Line and upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, the standard gauge interstate lines to Adelaide and Sydney, and the grain network in the north west of the state, connected to the ports at Geelong and Portland.

== Future expansion and upgrades ==

=== Regional Rail Revival ===

In 2017, the State Government under Premier Daniel Andrews initiated work on the Regional Rail Revival program, which allocated $1.75 billion to upgrade Victoria&#x27;s regional railways and provide more reliable and frequent passenger services. The program was largely funded by the Federal Government, through the Commonwealth&#x27;s asset-recycling fund.

The project allocated $518 million for upgrades to the Ballarat line, including 18 km of duplicated track between Deer Park West and Melton stations, new passing loops, new train stabling, upgraded stations and more car parking along the corridor. The Geelong line will see a new platform and track added to Waurn Ponds station and the investigation of a rail line to Armstrong Creek. The Gippsland line will have its signalling upgraded, some track duplicated, a new stabling facility built and platforms added to some stations. The North East, Shepparton and Warrnambool lines will see upgrades to allow VLocity trains to run on those corridors. The project will also include track speed and signalling upgrades to the Bendigo-Echuca line, with all projects aimed to be completed by 2022.

=== Faster rail ===

There have been numerous proposals for higher-speed passenger rail to regional Victoria. In 2018, the State Government allocated $50 million to plan for a high speed rail line to Geelong, and appointed a Fast Rail Reference Group of technical advisors. The Government suggested trains could run to Geelong and Ballarat at speeds up to 250 km/h, an increase on the 160 km/h limit of current VLocity trains. In 2019, the Federal Government pledged $2 billion for a fast rail line to Geelong, promising a travel time of 32 minutes. Business cases for faster rail to Albury-Wodonga and Greater Shepparton are currently being prepared for the National Faster Rail Agency, a federal body established in 2019.

==Infrastructure==
The trunk railway lines of Victoria are double track, some built as such, and others duplicated later on. Early sections of the suburban network were double track, with later additions being single track that were later duplicated.

The Bendigo and Geelong–Ballarat mainlines were both built as double track in the 1860s, but were singled in the 1930s and first decade of the 21st century respectively. The north-east line to Seymour was duplicated in the mid-1880s and remains so today, the Gippsland line to Moe was duplicated in the 1950s in conjunction with increased briquette traffic, and the busiest country line in the state to Geelong was progressively duplicated from 1959 to 1981.

Few railway tunnels exist in Victoria, with the exception of the Melbourne City Loop. The longest tunnel before the opening of the loop was on the Fyansford Cement Works Railway (near Geelong), where a 1300-metre-long tunnel existed on a narrow gauge quarry railway. Of those open today the longest is the single track 422-metre long Geelong Tunnel, followed by the double track 385-metre Elphinstone and the 390-metre-long Big Hill Tunnels on the Bendigo line. A 154-metre-long tunnel also exists on the Healesville line, as well as three tunnels on the suburban Hurstbridge line, and another on the freight lines under Footscray station.

On the interstate railway corridors, there are independent sections of track due to the use of both broad and standard gauges in the state, these sections being from Melbourne to Seymour and on to Albury (constructed in the 1960s), and Melbourne to Geelong (completed in 1995). The gauge issue also sees dual gauge track used, in areas including Maryborough, North Geelong, and various freight terminals in Melbourne.

The maximum speed of suburban electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115 km/h, with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130 km/h on the same track, and up to 160 km/h on specified lines. The maximum axle loading of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne axle loading operating. Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.

===Track gauge===
The majority of the railways of Victoria are of broad gauge, presenting break-of-gauge difficulties when connections were made with New South Wales which uses standard gauge. In addition, the Victorian Railways experimented with four short narrow gauge lines of in the early 20th century. Efforts to eliminate the gauge issue were proposed many times in the intervening years, with a Royal Commission in 1921 deciding &quot;that the gauge of 4-ft. 8.5-in. be adopted as the standard for Australia; that no mechanical, third rail, or other device would meet the situation, and that uniformity could be secured by one means only, viz., by conversion of the gauges other than 4-ft. 8.5-in.&quot;

By the 1950s, interstate traffic was suffering from the break-of-gauge at the New South Wales state border, and a parallel standard gauge line was opened from the Melbourne to join the New South Wales system in 1962, along with a bogie exchange depot to allow wagons to operate across the broad and standard gauge networks. The second interstate link from Victoria to Adelaide (the oldest single-gauge inter-capital line dating from 1887) was converted from broad to standard gauge in 1995 enabling rail traffic from Victoria to access the rest of the nation without disruption.

Today, the standard gauge network consists of the two main interstate lines, and a number of branch lines in the far west of the state. Gauge conversion 
of 2000 kilometres of track was announced in May 2001 by the Victorian Government under the Linking Victoria program, but did not proceed due to the difficulty of achieving any agreement with then track manager, Freight Australia. The works would have covered 13 lines, including the Mildura line via Geelong, Ballarat, and Maryborough; the north western Victorian grain network; and the lines centred upon Seymour and Benalla in the north east. Conversion of the regional and suburban passenger networks is not envisioned. In 2008, the conversion of the North East line was announced, with the conversion of of broad gauge track to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury providing double track along the section.

The Murray Basin Rail Project, commenced in 2014, aimed to convert the Mildura, Manangatang, and Sea Lake lines to standard gauge, in order to allow the grain traffic in the state&#x27;s north-west to access the ports of Portland, Geelong, and Melbourne, and to enable other freight on the lines to access the national standard gauge network. The converted Mildura line reopened in 2018, but standardisation of the Sea Lake and Manangatang lines was deferred until 2020 due to the collapse of the major works contract.

===Loading gauge===
The Victorian loading gauge for vehicles is sized between that of British and American practices. Wagons may be up to long, wide, and carry loads up to 4.27 metres above the rail height. Double stacking of container wagons is not possible under these limits, with high containers the largest permitted, with the exception of high containers on some routes. Trials were made with the 4D double deck passenger train on some suburban lines, requiring alterations to overhead bridges and structures, but no double deck trains are used today.

===Signalling===


Victoria uses a mix of railway signalling practices: British route signalling with home and distant signals (&quot;2 position signalling&quot;) and American speed signalling (&quot;3 position signalling&quot;).

Semaphore signals were used on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were provided as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the &quot;disc&quot; type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant &quot;somersault&quot; type main line signals adopted in 1887, both of which are still in use today. Green was not adopted as the &quot;All Right&quot; colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.

The safeworking of trains between stations on the early lines was time interval working, where a train would be allowed to leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with &quot;Winters Block&quot; working between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the &quot;Double line Block&quot; system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the &quot;Staff and Ticket&quot; system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.

Heavier suburban traffic on the Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required a large number of staffed signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.

A variant of the &quot;Automatic Block System&quot;, &quot;Automatic and Track Control&quot; (ATC) has since been introduced, which provides the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury, and then on the main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.

Today, little mechanical signalling remains, with local signal boxes controlling signals abolished from many areas as part of the Regional Fast Rail project. The suburban network and busier regional lines use variants of Automatic Block Signalling, while quieter lines use the Train Staff and Ticket or Train Order systems of safeworking. Train protection has also progressed, with the Train Protection &amp; Warning System also introduced on major passenger lines as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

==Rolling stock==
Rollingstock in Victoria has used air braking since tests of continuous train brakes were carried out in 1884. Initially, screw couplings were used to connect wagons, but from 1924, automatic knuckle couplers were introduced, with buffers removed from freight wagons by 1960.

===Locomotives===
In Victoria, groups of locomotives of the same design are classed together by letter, in a system introduced in 1886. Initially, low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916, this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which is unique to the class. In some cases, locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, and in some cases there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a &quot;0&quot;, while others start with a &quot;1&quot;.

The first locomotives used in the state were small steam locomotives, and by the end of the 19th century 0-6-0 tender engines were used on goods, and 4-4-0 configurations for passenger workings. The majority of locomotives were imported from Britain, from companies such as Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, Robert Stephenson &amp; Company, R &amp; W Hawthorn and George England and Co. The Williamstown Workshops also built locomotives locally, as did the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat.

As the size of trains increased, so did the locomotives. The 4-6-0 wheel arrangement became popular for passenger and mixed traffic work with the D3 and A2 classes, and the 2-8-0 arrangement on goods with the K, J and C classes lasting into the 1960s. These were then followed by the 4-6-2 S class &quot;Pacifics&quot; for the &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; express, and the single 4-8-4 H class locomotive H220, the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive. The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4-6-4 R class and 2-8-0 J classes. Although they were of more modern design, their advantages were overshadowed by the simultaneous arrival of the first diesels.

Electric locomotives were first acquired with the electrification of the suburban railways, the E class suburban engines acquired in 1923 and 1928–29, followed by the L class from 1953 when the mainline to Traralgon was electrified for briquette traffic.

Dieselisation occurred from 1951 with the F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then followed by the T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching the end of their lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.

Today, the former Victorian Railways locomotive fleet has been split into two, with the N class utilised by V/Line on passenger services, with the remainder with Pacific National or other private operators in freight use. No new passenger locomotives have been built since the 1980s, with Diesel Multiple Units being acquired instead. Freight operations have seen the re-powering of the G and X classes, as well as the restoration to service of stored locomotives, now up to 50 years old.

===Passenger===

Early passenger services were operated with 4 and 6 wheeled &quot;dogbox&quot; passenger carriage with small compartments and no side corridors. Later years saw the provision of side corridors to provide access down the train, and onboard toilets. Sleeping carriages was first introduced in 1887, and dining cars from 1908.

Larger bogie rollingstock started to appear from the turn of the 20th century, with the E type carriage stock introduced on &quot;The Overland&quot;, and smaller W type carriage stock on intrastate trains. The first air conditioned carriage was introduced in 1935, when one of the E type carriages was fitted. All steel carriages came to the Victorian Railways in 1927, with the construction of the &quot;Avoca&quot; and &quot;Hopkins&quot; dining cars, followed by the S type carriage stock for the new &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; in 1937.

On the Melbourne suburban network, Electric Multiple Units were introduced speeding up services. Experiments were also made with various diesel and petrol railcars for use smaller branch lines, with the DERM being the most successful, remaining in service from 1928 to 1991. A fleet of Walker railcars was also introduced in the 1950s, along with Z type saloon carriage stock for both intra and interstate trains.

By the 1980s, country passenger services were run down, and older wooden rolling stock was now approaching their use by date. As a result, the N type carriages were introduced from 1981, followed by the converted H type stock from 1984. Since then, diesel multiple units have become the norm for new purchases, with the Sprinter introduced in 1992, and the VLocity from 2005.

===Freight===

Early wagons were of all-wood construction, followed by wooden bodies on steel underframes, then all-steel wagons. They were built on four-wheeled underframes, but in 1871 bogie vehicles began to appear. Groups of wagons of the same design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979, the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system, the first letter represents the owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the fourth letter indicates the maximum running speed.

The last four-wheeled open wagons were built in 1958, but were not scrapped in large numbers until the 1980s, when new bogie wagons replaced them. In 1987, the bogie wagon fleet numbered about 5000: approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today, the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers about 2600, with large numbers of louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.

==Operations==
===Commodities===
Victoria does not have a dominant mining base as in other states, and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for rail freight traffic. In the early 20th century, rail was a &quot;common carrier&quot; and was required to carry almost any freight offered. After World War I, road competition increased, until in 1933, legislation was passed to regulate road vehicles competing with rail on specific routes. From 1974 to the 1980s, intrastate road freight was deregulated, and the Victorian Railways&#x27; &quot;common carrier&quot; obligations were removed, resulting in the loss to road of much non-bulk freight. In 1987, 10.51 million tonnes of freight was carried by rail, with bulk grain being the main commodity, consisting of 31.4% of traffic.

By 2016, the only remaining general containerised freight services on the intrastate network were operated to Warrnambool, to Dooen, to Merbein and Donald, and to Tocumwal, all originating from the Port of Melbourne and running between three and five times per week. Other intrastate rail traffic was primarily specialised bulk freight, including mineral sands between Hopetoun, Hamilton and Portland in the state&#x27;s west; export rice between Deniliqiun and the Port of Melbourne; paper between Australian Paper Mills in Maryvale and Melbourne; and steel to BlueScope steel plants at Hastings and Somerton.

===Companies===

The first railways in Victoria were operated by private companies, but when the companies failed or defaulted, the state government took over. The government agency was known as the &quot;Department of Railways&quot; from 1856 to 1883, when the &quot;Victorian Railways Commissioners Act&quot; established the Victorian Railways. In 1973 the &quot;Railways (Amendment) Act 1972&quot; passed management of the Railways from the Victorian Railways Commissioners to a Victorian Railways Board. In 1976 the railways were rebranded as VicRail.

In 1983, VicRail was split into the State Transport Authority for country rail and road, passenger and freight services under the V/Line brand; and the Metropolitan Transit Authority, taking over suburban passenger operations. In 1989, these authorities were merged into the Public Transport Corporation and suburban services were rebranded as &quot;The Met&quot;.

In 1993, long-distance country rail services previously run by the government-owned operator V/Line were offered to private operators. Several rail services were replaced by road coach services. The first private operator in Victoria was the West Coast Railway, which successfully tendered to operate the railway to Warrnambool. In 1993 Professor Fred Hilmer presented the findings of the National Competition Policy Review Committee, known as the Hilmer Report, leading to the introduction of a National Competition Policy in 1995. One effect was to allow new rail freight operators to establish operations in Victoria. Specialised Container Transport began operating trains to Perth in 1995 and Great Northern Rail Services started intrastate operations.

Privatisation of the Public Transport Corporation commenced under the Kennett Government of the 1990s. V/Line was split into separate freight and passenger divisions, and &quot;The Met&quot; was divided into Hillside Trains and Bayside Trains. These separate bodies were all sold separately in 1999: V/Line Freight and the rural intrastate network to Freight Victoria, a consortium led by American operator RailAmerica; Hillside Trains and track lease to Connex Melbourne; and V/Line Passenger and Bayside Trains, renamed M&gt;Train and with its track lease, to British operator National Express.

On 16 December 2002, National Express announced their intention to withdraw financial support from their rail operations in Victoria, including V/Line Passenger and M&gt;Train. The government temporarily resumed control of its systems through receivers and decided to retender the metropolitan rail network to a single operator; Connex won the contract and took control of the entire metropolitan system in February 2004. Meanwhile, in July 2003, the government announced its intention to retain V/Line Passenger in public ownership, and set up the state-owned V/Line Corporation, which bought the operator out of receivership on 1 October 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;V/Line annual report 2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

16 August 2004 saw the Freight Victoria business and rural track lease was purchased by Pacific National, but by November 2006 they entered into an agreement to sell the track lease back to the Victorian Government for $133.8 million, with the sale completed on 7 May 2007 and V/Line becoming track manager.

In December 2007, Pacific National announced plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 for the purposes of asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool – Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne – Horsham container service.

==Lines==
Victoria&#x27;s first railway was a 4 km Victorian broad gauge line between the Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station) and Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), constructed by the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854. Today, Melbourne&#x27;s suburban railway network consists of 16 electrified lines, the central City Loop subway, and 218 stations, with a total length of 372 km of the electrified lines, operated by Metro Trains Melbourne under franchise to the Government of Victoria.

In Gippsland, the Orbost line was constructed as an extension of suburban lines between 1877 and 1888 to Bairnsdale, and extended eastwards to Orbost in 1916. The line between Dandenong and Traralgon was electrified in 1954, but electrification was cut back progressively to Pakenham between 1987 and 2001. V/Line passenger trains now run as far as Bairnsdale.

The South Gippsland line was opened from Dandenong to Cranbourne, Leongatha and Port Albert between 1888 and 1892. A number of branch lines were also built, with almost all closed in stages between the early 1970s and 1994, except for part has since been electrified and re-opened as part of the suburban network, and between Nyora and Leongatha where the South Gippsland Tourist Railway operated heritage services, until they folded in 2016. The entirety of the line is now closed beyond Cranbourne, with the section beyond Nyora fully dismantled

The North East line originated from a suburban line to Essendon in 1860, being extended to Wodonga by 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883. A standard gauge track was completed parallel with the broad gauge track from Albury to Melbourne in 1962. The broad gauge track has been converted to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury.

The Shepparton line was built from Mangalore to Shepparton in 1880 and extended to the New South Wales Government Railways at Tocumwal at a break-of-gauge in 1908. V/Line passenger services run as far as Shepparton.

The Bendigo line was completed in 1862, with extensions were opened to Echuca in 1864, and Swan Hill in 1890, followed by a number of lines throughout the north-west corner of the state. Only these lines continue to see V/Line services, with other lines in the region only seeing freight traffic.

The Main Western line had its beginnings in the first railway line from Melbourne to Ballarat, the Geelong-Ballarat line that opened in 1862. The line extended from Ballarat to Ararat between 1874 and 1875, but it was not until 1889 that the direct line between Melbourne and Ballarat was opened, built from both ends in stages until they met at Ballan. Further branch lines followed to Portland and other western towns. The line formed the first intercolonial railway line in Australia, when it was extended to the South Australian Railways at Serviceton in 1887. Up until the 1990s, the Ballarat line was on the main route between Melbourne and Adelaide, as well as &quot;The Overland&quot; services to Adelaide, until the One Nation Program rerouted the main interstate line via Geelong and Maroona as standard gauge.

The Warrnambool line was started when the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company opened the Geelong line to Newport in 1857, being extended to Spencer Street station in 1859. The line was taken over by Victorian Railways in 1860 and a line was opened from Geelong to Ballarat in 1862, and later extended south-east from 1876, reaching Warrnambool and Port Fairy in 1890. Branch lines also existed to Queenscliff, Beech Forest, and a number of other towns.

==Private railways==

A small number of private railways have also existed at various times. Some, such as the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company, and the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company and St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company were acquired by the Victorian Railways and made part of the core state network in 1860 and 1878 respectively. Other country branch lines were also built by private companies: namely the Kerang-Koondrook Tramway and the Deniliquin and Moama Railway, both not being acquired until the 20th century.

In addition to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes. These included the Yallourn 900mm Railway in the Latrobe Valley open cut coal mines, the Fyansford Cement Works Railway near Geelong, the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw, and the Powelltown Tramway from Yarra Junction.

Most logging tramways operated in the Otway Ranges, Gippsland, and the inner east of the Great Dividing Range; primarily between the 1850s and the 1950s, with only one surviving into the 1960s. They were primarily of or gauge, with , , , and variants also used.

==Railway preservation==
Organised railway preservation commenced in Victoria with the formation of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society in 1955, and operating under the Emerald Tourist Railway Board from 1977. Formed to operate the narrow gauge gauge railway in the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne, the group continues to operate the railway today.

The demise of the last of the steam locomotives in Victoria commenced in the 1960s, with the Australian Railway Historical Society and Association of Railway Enthusiasts working with the Victorian Railways to have a number of locomotives preserved for the future. In 1962 the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum was established at Williamstown North to house static exhibits, and Steamrail Victoria was formed in 1965 to assist in the restoration of locomotives and carriages for use on special trains.

By the 1980s, a number of heritage railways had been established in Victoria on closed branch lines. These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past. The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages, electric multiple units, rail motors, and diesel locomotives. In 2006, heritage railways carried 542,000 patrons over 161 km of track; with 28 operational steam locomotives, 47 diesels, 14 railmotors, and 192 carriages.

Heritage Railways and Operators include:
* 707 Operations, Newport
* Puffing Billy Railway, Belgrave
* Bellarine Railway, Queenscliff
* Daylesford Spa Country Railway, Daylesford

* Steamrail Victoria, Newport
* Walhalla Goldfields Railway, Walhalla
* Yarra Valley Railway, Healesville
* South Gippsland Railway, Leongatha
* Tramway Museum Society of Victoria, Bylands

==Rail trails==
A number of former rail lines in Melbourne and regional Victoria have been converted into &quot;rail trails&quot;, for walking, cycling and horse riding. These make excellent tracks for beginners as the lines were originally designed to avoid steep gradients. Most lines are still in public ownership. Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.

Trails around Melbourne include:
* Inner Circle (Rushall to Royal Park)
* Outer Circle (Fairfield to Hughesdale)
* Rosstown (Hughesdale to Elsternwick)
* Hawthorn to Kew
* Red Hill (Merricks to Red Hill)
* Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail

Trails around Victoria include:
* East Gippsland (Bairnsdale to Newmeralla)
* The Beechy (Colac to Beech Forest)
* Crater to Coast (Camperdown to Timboon)
* Ballarat–Skipton
* Murray to the Mountains (Wangaratta to Beechworth and Bright)
* Great Victorian Rail Trail (Tallarook to Alexandra and Mansfield)
* Great Southern Rail Trail (Leongatha–Foster, future extension to Yarram)
* Bass Coast Rail Trail (Anderson–Wonthaggi, future extension to Nyora)
* Port Fairy to Warrnambool Rail Trail

==Legislation, governance and access==
===Key statutes===
The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act. The Act establishes the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure as the integration agency for Victoria&#x27;s transport system. The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the Director of Public Transport and V/Line. In addition, the Act creates VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State&#x27;s rail network. As a result of recent changes to the Transport Integration Act, the responsibilities of the Director of Public Transport are being progressively assumed by the new Public Transport Development Authority, a major initiative of the Bailieu Government.

===Safety===
====Regulation====
The safety of rail operations in Victoria is regulated by the Rail Safety Act 2006 which applies to all commercial passenger and freight operations as well as tourist and heritage railways. The Act creates a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires rail operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations. Accredited rail operators are also required to have a safety management system to guide their operations.

Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the Rail Safety Act are contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The safety regulator for the rail system in Victoria is the Director, Transport Safety (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the Transport Integration Act 2010.

====Investigation====

Rail operators in Victoria can also be the subject of no blame investigations conducted by the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety or the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). The Chief Investigator is charged by the Transport Integration Act with conducting investigations into rail safety matters including incidents and trends. ATSB, on the other hand, claims jurisdiction over the same matters where they occur on the Designated Interstate Rail Network.

===Ticketing and conduct===
Ticketing requirements for public transport in Victoria are mainly contained in the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006 and the Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual. Rules about safe and fair conduct on trains and trams in Melbourne are generally contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 and the Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005.

===Tourist and heritage railways===

Tourist and Heritage Railways in Victoria are governed by provisions in the Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010 which commenced on 1 October 2011.

<text>The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) was a specialist corps in the British Army which provided medical services to all Army personnel and their families, in war and in peace.

On 15 November 2024, the corps was amalgamated with the Royal Army Dental Corps and Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps to form the Royal Army Medical Service.

==History==

===Origins===
Medical services in the British armed services date from the formation of the Standing Regular Army after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. Prior to this, from as early as the 13th century there are records of surgeons and physicians being appointed by the English army to attend in times of war; but this was the first time a career was provided for a Medical Officer (MO), both in peacetime and in war. For much of the next two hundred years, army medical provision was mostly arranged on a regimental basis, with each battalion arranging its own hospital facilities and medical supplies. An element of oversight was provided by the appointment of three officials: a Surgeon-general, a Physician-general and an Apothecary-general.

====Army Medical Board====
In 1793 an Army Medical Board was formed (consisting of the Surgeon-general, Physician-general and Inspector of Regimental Infirmaries), which promoted a more centralised approach drawing on concurrent civilian healthcare practices. The Board set up five General (as opposed to regimental) Military Hospitals: four in the naval ports of Chatham, Deal, Plymouth and Gosport (Portsmouth), and one (known as York Hospital) in Chelsea. These hospitals received large numbers of sick and injured soldiers from the French Revolutionary Wars (so much so that by 1799 additional General Military Hospitals were set up in Yarmouth, Harwich and Colchester Barracks); the Board, however, was criticised, for both high expenditure and poor management. By the end of the century the Board had been disestablished, and most of the General Hospitals were closed or repurposed not long afterwards. By 1807 the only General Hospitals in operation were York Hospital (which was close to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, where invalided soldiers were routinely sent for pension assessment) and the hospital at Parkhurst (which was attached to the army&#x27;s Invalid Depôt on the Isle of Wight, where soldiers invalided home from service overseas were initially sent).

====Army Medical Department====
In 1810 the offices of Surgeon-general and Physician-general were abolished and a new Army Medical Department was established, overseen by a board chaired by a Director-General of the Medical Department. James McGrigor served in this role from 1815 to 1851: McGrigor, who has been called the Father of Army Medicine, had served as principal medical officer under the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War. During that time he had introduced significant changes in the organisation of the army&#x27;s medical services, placing them on a far more formal footing: together with George Guthrie, he instituted the use of dedicated ambulance wagons to transport the wounded, and set up a series of temporary hospitals (formed of prefabricated huts brought over from Britain) to aid the evacuation of wounded soldiers from the front line.

After the end of the Peninsular War Fort Pitt in Chatham became the &quot;de facto&quot; headquarters of the Army Medical Department (the Invalid Depôt having relocated to Chatham from the Isle of Wight). A General Military Hospital was established on the site, which took on many of the functions (and most of the patients) of the old York Hospital. The influence of the Director-General grew, and from 1833 he was given sole charge of the department. That same year the (hitherto separate) Irish Medical Board was merged into the department, as was the Ordnance Medical Department twenty years later.

The Crimean War, however, would lay bare the inadequacies of the Army Medical Department (and many others). In 1854 there were only 163 surgeons on the Department&#x27;s books; the Army had just two ambulance wagons, both of which were left behind in Bulgaria, and it relied for stretcher bearers on the Hospital Conveyance Corps (which was made up of pensioners and others deemed too infirm to fight). Two base hospitals were set up in Scutari, more than 300 miles from the front. Within weeks of arriving, more than half the British force had been incapacitated by disease (mainly typhus, dysentery and cholera); and in the space of seven months some 10,000 British servicemen out of a total of 28,000 had died.

===The Department after Crimea===
In June 1855 a Medical Staff Corps was established (in place of the Hospital Conveyance Corps, which had by then been merged into the Land Transport Corps). It was formed of nine companies, overseen by a single officer, and had its headquarters at Fort Pitt. The Medical Staff Corps was set up to provide orderlies and stretcher bearers (later it was renamed the Army Hospital Corps, but reverted to its original title in 1884). The officers known as purveyors, who were responsible for medical provisioning, were formed into a separate Purveyors&#x27; Department by a Royal Warrant of 1861; nine years later it was merged into the Control Department, and later became part of the Army Service Corps. In 1857, in response to the Crimean debacle, a Royal Commission had been appointed for the improvement of sanitary conditions in Army barracks and hospitals; it recommended (among other things) the establishment of an Army Medical School, which was set up in 1860 at Fort Pitt Hospital before moving in 1863 to the new Royal Victoria Military Hospital at Netley outside Southampton.

Netley functioned as a general hospital, but much of the army&#x27;s medical work continued to be carried out at a regimental level. At the time a regiment of 1,044 men would have a medical staff of one surgeon and two assistants (with an additional assistant being appointed if the regiment was stationed abroad, so as to allow the senior assistant to remain at home with the companies appointed to the depot).

The regimental basis of appointment for MOs continued until 1873, when a coordinated army medical service was set up. To join, a doctor needed to be qualified, single, and aged at least 21, and then undergo a further examination in physiology, surgery, medicine, zoology, botany and physical geography including meteorology, and also to satisfy various other requirements (including having dissected the whole body at least once and having attended 12 midwifery cases); the results were published in three classes by the Army Medical School. In 1884 the medical officers of the Army Medical Department were brought together with the quartermasters who provided their supplies to form the Army Medical Staff, which was given command of the Medical Staff Corps (which consisted entirely of other ranks).

Nevertheless, there was much unhappiness in the Army Medical Service in the following years as medical officers did not have military rank but &quot;advantages corresponding to relative military rank&quot; (such as choice of quarters, rates of lodging money, servants, fuel and light, allowances on account of injuries received in action, and pensions and allowances to widows and families). They had inferior pay in India, excessive amounts of Indian and colonial service (being required to serve in India six years at a stretch), and less recognition in honours and awards. They did not have their own identity as did the Army Service Corps, whose officers did have military rank. A number of complaints were published, and the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; campaigned loudly. For over two years from 27 July 1887 there were no recruits to the Army Medical Department. A parliamentary committee reported in 1890, highlighting the doctors&#x27; injustices. There was no response from the Secretary of State for War. The British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians and others redoubled their protests. Eventually, by authority of a royal warrant dated 25 June 1898, officers and soldiers providing medical services were incorporated into a new body known as the Royal Army Medical Corps; its first Colonel-in-Chief was Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught.

===The Corps in the 20th century===
The RAMC began to develop during the Boer War of 1899–1902. The Corps itself lost 743 officers and 6130 soldiers in the war. However, far more of them, and thousands more of the sick and wounded whom they treated, would have died if it had not been for the civilian doctors working in South Africa as volunteers—such as Sir Frederick Treves, Sir George Makins, Sir Howard Henry Tooth and Professor Alexander Ogston—who, having seen how unprepared to deal with epidemics the RAMC and the Army itself were, decided that a radical reform was needed. Chief among them was Alfred Fripp, who had been chosen by the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital Committee to order all the necessary materials and medical personnel, and oversee the setting-up of a private hospital at Deelfontein to cater, initially, for 520 &#x27;sick and wounded.&#x27; The contrast between the smooth working of the IYH at Deelfontein with the chaos of the RAMC hospitals, where an enteric epidemic had overwhelmed the staff, led to questions in Parliament, mainly by William Burdett-Coutts. In July 1901 the first meeting of the Committee of Reform took place, with all the aforementioned civilian experts, plus Sir Edwin Cooper Perry, making up half the number; the rest were Army men, and included Alfred Keogh, whom the new Secretary of State for War, St John Brodrick, later Earl of Midleton, appointed Chairman of this committee and the subsequent Advisory Committee. Neither would have met so soon—if at all—but for Fripp&#x27;s concern to limit unnecessary suffering, and for his ten years&#x27; friendship with the new King, Edward VII. Fripp showed him his plans for reform and the King made sure that they were not shelved by his government. Part of his plan was to move the Netley Hospital and Medical School to a Thames-side site at Millbank, London. Cooper Perry, Fripp&#x27;s colleague from Guy&#x27;s Hospital, was instrumental in making this happen, as well as using his formidable talents as an organizer in other services for the Reform Committee. Fripp and Cooper Perry were knighted for their services to the RAMC Committee of Reform in 1903.

During the First World War, the corps reached its apogee both in size and experience. The two people in charge of the RAMC in the Great War were Arthur Sloggett, the senior RAMC officer seconded to the IYH in Deelfontein who acquiesced in all Fripp&#x27;s surprising innovations, and Alfred Keogh, whom Fripp recommended to Brodrick as an RAMC man well-regarded when Registrar of No.3 General Hospital in Cape Town. Its main base was for long the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital at Millbank, London (now closed). It set up a network of military general hospitals around the United Kingdom and established clinics and hospitals in countries where there were British troops. Major-General Sir William Macpherson of the RAMC wrote the official &quot;Medical History of the War&quot; (HMSO 1922). 

Before the Second World War, RAMC recruits were required to be at least tall, and could enlist up to 30 years of age. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours, and a further five years with the reserve, or three years and nine years. They trained for six months at the RAMC Depot, Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Church Crookham, before proceeding to specialist trade training. The RAMC Depot moved from Church Crookham to Keogh Barracks in Mytchett in 1964.

=== Amalgamation ===
The Secretary of State for Defence John Healey announced on 15 October 2024, that it would amalgamate with the Royal Army Dental Corps and Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps to form one unified corps, the Royal Army Medical Service, on 15 November 2024.

==RAMC General Hospitals in the First World War==

The corps established a network of home-country military hospitals for military casualties during the First World War. The hospitals were managed by Territorial Force personnel and were headquartered as follows:

London Command
* 1st London General Hospital: St Gabriel&#x27;s College, Lambeth
* 2nd London General Hospital: St Mark&#x27;s College, Chelsea
* 3rd London General Hospital: Royal Victoria Patriotic Building

==Facilities==

The military medical services are now a tri-service body, with the hospital facilities of Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy combined. The main hospital facility is now the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, a joint military-National Health Service centre. The majority of injured service personnel were treated in Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham prior to the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital&#x27;s opening. There was press coverage critical of the standard of care during the surge of UK military commitments in the years following the second invasion of Iraq, but it was later reported that the care provided to injured troops had significantly improved.

Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough and Frimley Park Hospital (near Aldershot Garrison) also have military hospital units attached to them but they do not treat operational casualties.

==Insignia==
The RAMC had its own distinctive insignia:
* Dark blue beret, the default Army colour worn by units without distinctive coloured berets. The exceptions were members of 16 Medical Regiment, who wore the maroon beret, 225 Scottish General Support Medical Regiment (previously Field Ambulance) and members of 205 (Scottish) Field Hospital, who wore the traditional Scottish Tam o&#x27; Shanter headdress with Corps badge on tartan backing, and medical personnel attached to field units with distinctive coloured berets, who usually wore the beret of that unit (e.g. maroon for The Parachute Regiment and sky blue for the Army Air Corps). There was also a small attachment to Special Forces, the Medical Support Unit (MSU), who wore the sandy beret of the SAS.
* Cap badge depicting the Rod of Asclepius, surmounted by a crown, enclosed within a laurel wreath, with the regimental motto &quot;In Arduis Fidelis&quot; (&quot;Faithful in Adversity&quot;) in a scroll beneath. The cap badge was worn 1 inch above the left eye on the beret. The cap badge of soldiers beneath the rank of Warrant Officer 1 must have also been backed by an oval patch of dull cherry-red coloured cloth measuring 3.81 cm (1.5 inches) wide and 6.35 cm (2.5 inches) high sewn directly to the beret.

==Colonels-in-Chief==

* (1942–1953) HM Queen Mary 
* (1953–2002) HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother

==Order of precedence==


==Officer ranks==
==Gallantry awards==
Since the Victoria Cross was instituted in 1856 there have been 27 Victoria Crosses and two bars awarded to army medical personnel. A bar, indicating a subsequent award of a second Victoria Cross, has only ever been awarded three times, two of them to medical officers. Twenty-three of these Victoria Crosses are on display in the Army Medical Services Museum. The corps also has one recipient of both the Victoria Cross and the Iron Cross. One officer was awarded the George Cross in the Second World War. A young member of the corps, Private Michelle Norris, became the first woman to be awarded the Military Cross following her actions in Iraq on 11 June 2006.

One VC is in existence that is not counted in any official records. In 1856, Queen Victoria laid a Victoria Cross beneath the foundation stone of the Royal Victoria Military Hospital, Netley. When the hospital was demolished in 1966, the VC, known as &quot;The Netley VC&quot;, was retrieved and is now on display in the Army Medical Services Museum.

=== Military abbreviations applicable to the Medical Corps ===
Within the military, Medical officers could occupy a number of roles that were dependent on experience, rank and location. Within military documentation, numerous abbreviations were used to identify these roles, of which the following are among the most common.

==Journal==
Since 1903, the corps had published an academic journal titled the &quot;Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps&quot; (&quot;JRAMC&quot;). Its stated aim was to &quot;publish high quality research, reviews and case reports, as well as other invited articles, which pertain to the practice of military medicine in its broadest sense&quot;. Submissions were accepted from serving members of all ranks, as well as academics from outside the military. Initially a monthly publication, in 2015 it was being published quarterly by BMJ on behalf of the RAMC Association.

==Museum==
The Museum of Military Medicine is based at Keogh Barracks in Mytchett in Surrey.

==Band==
From 1898 to 1984, the RAMC maintained a staff band in its ranks. The earliest record of music in the RAMC was in the 1880s when a Corporal of the Medical Staff Corps was sent to Kneller Hall to be trained as a bugler. It was founded officially in 1898, with official permission for the band being given by the Duke of Connaught, first Colonel-in Chief of the RAMC. In 1902, the band had reached a stature to where it could take part in the Coronation Procession of King Edward VII. On 1 January 1939, the RAMC Band was taken over by the Army Council and was officially recognised as a state sponsored band. In 1962, Derek Waterhouse became the first official drum major to be appointed to the band. It was disbanded in 1984, being one of the first to go in the as a result of the restructuring of the Army. It is today retained in the Army Medical Services Band.

<doc id="1182291" wikidata="Q1779650" url="?curid=1182291" title="Design engineer">
<text>A design engineer is an engineer focused on the engineering design process in any of the various engineering disciplines (including civil, mechanical, electrical, chemical, textiles, aerospace, nuclear, manufacturing, systems, and structural /building/architectural) and design disciplines like Human-Computer Interaction.
Design engineers tend to work on products and systems that involve adapting and using complex scientific and mathematical techniques. The emphasis tends to be on utilizing engineering physics and other applied sciences to develop solutions for society.

A design engineer usually works with a team of other engineers and other types of designers (e.g. industrial designers), to develop conceptual and detailed designs that ensure a product functions, performs, and is fit for its purpose. They may also work with marketers to develop the product concept and specifications to meet customer needs, and may direct the design effort. In many engineering areas, a distinction is made between the &quot;design engineer&quot; and other engineering roles (e.g. planning engineer, project engineer, test engineer). Analysis tends to play a larger role for the latter areas, while synthesis is more paramount for the former; nevertheless, all such roles are technically part of the &quot;overall&quot; engineering design process.

When an engineering project involves public safety, design engineers involved are often required to be licensed - for example, as a Professional Engineer (in the U.S. and Canada). There is often an &quot;industrial exemption&quot; for engineers working on project only internally to their organization, although the scope and conditions of such exemptions vary widely across jurisdictions.

==Design engineer tasks==
Design engineers may work in a team along with other designers to create the drawings necessary for prototyping and production, or in the case of buildings, for construction. However, with the advent of CAD and solid modeling software, the design engineers may create the drawings themselves, or perhaps with the help of many corporate service providers.

The next responsibility of many design engineers is prototyping. A model of the product is created and reviewed. Prototypes are either functional or non-functional. Functional &quot;alpha&quot; prototypes are used for testing; non-functional prototypes are used for form and fit checking. Virtual prototyping and hence for any such software solutions may also be used. This stage is where design flaws are found and corrected, and tooling, manufacturing fixtures, and packaging are developed.

Once the &quot;alpha&quot; prototype is finalized after many iterations, the next step is the &quot;beta&quot; pre-production prototype. The design engineer, working with an industrial engineer, manufacturing engineer, and quality engineer, reviews an initial run of components and assemblies for design compliance and fabrication/manufacturing methods analysis. This is often determined through statistical process control. Variations in the product are correlated to aspects of the process and eliminated. The most common metric used is the process capability index Cpk. A Cpk of 1.0 is considered the baseline acceptance for full production go-ahead.

The design engineer may follow the product and make requested changes and corrections throughout the whole life of the product. This is referred to as &quot;cradle to grave&quot; engineering. The design engineer works closely with the manufacturing engineer throughout the product life cycle, and is often required to investigate and validate design changes which could lead to possible production cost reductions in order to consistently reduce the price as the product becomes mature and thus subject to discounting to defend market volumes against newer competing products. Moreover, design changes may be also made mandatory by updates in laws and regulations.

The design process is an information intensive one, and design engineers have been found to spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information. In addition to design engineers&#x27; core technical competence, research has demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to succeed in the role.

Amongst other more detailed findings, a recent work sampling study found that design engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. There was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.

==Design Engineers in the Software Engineering Industry==
In the Software Engineering industry, a Design Engineer is a person with the skills to tackle both design and software development tasks. As Maggie Appleton puts it, &quot;a person who sits squarely at the intersection of design and engineering, and works to bridge the gap between them&quot;. Some of their main tasks include prototyping and designing in code.

<doc id="1182293" wikidata="Q1349850" url="?curid=1182293" title="Jerry Juhl">
<text>Jerome Ravn Juhl (June 28, 1938 – September 25, 2005) was an American television and film writer, best known for his work with The Muppets.

==Biography==
Juhl was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota; his family moved to Menlo Park, California, when he was 14. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater arts from San Jose State University in 1961 and worked on children&#x27;s shows for local television stations while in college. He met Frank Oz when they both worked for the Oakland Recreation Department&#x27;s Vagabond Puppet Theater as teenagers. The two later met Henson at a puppeteer gathering in California.

Juhl was recruited by Jim Henson as a puppeteer and writer on &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;. He focused increasingly on writing as other puppeteers, such as Frank Oz, joined the Henson stable.

Juhl was the head writer on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; from seasons 2 to 5 (season 1 had Jack Burns as head writer). He also wrote for the television shows &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; and &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;. He was involved in some capacity with all of the &quot;Muppet&quot; films from &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; in 1979 to &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; in 1999. According to Lisa Henson, &quot;So much of the humour, irreverence, caring and heart began with Jerry. He was, in many ways, the real voice of the Muppets.&quot;

He appeared as himself in the 1981 documentary &quot;Of Muppets and Men: The Making of The Muppet Show&quot;, the 1984 documentary &quot;Henson&#x27;s Place&quot;, and the 1994 documentary &quot;The World of Jim Henson&quot;. In addition to being interviewed in all three, he also appeared in archival footage in the last two.

He was married to Susan Doerr Juhl and lived in Caspar, California. In his last few years he semi-retired from writing, but taught at local colleges, coached at local Mendocino Coast theatres such as Gloriana Opera Company, and spoke at puppeteer conventions. He died on September 25, 2005, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 67.

==Awards==

Juhl co-wrote &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; with Jack Burns, for which the two shared a Saturn Award nomination for Best Writing. He was nominated for a shared Emmy four times, for his writing on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, finally winning the award in 1981 for Outstanding Writing in a Variety, Music or Comedy Program. He was also awarded for his work on &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; (Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program, 1989, 1990) and &quot;The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson&quot; (Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program, 1991). His work on &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot; won him the WGA Award for Variety – Musical, Award, Tribute, Special Event.

<doc id="1182305" wikidata="Q3137201" url="?curid=1182305" title="Savio Vega">
<text>Savio Vega (born August 10, 1964) is a Puerto Rican professional wrestler. He is known for his work in World Wrestling Federation, World Wrestling Council and International Wrestling Association.

After leaving the WWF in 1999, Rivera returned to Puerto Rico and joined Víctor Quiñones&#x27; promotion, the International Wrestling Association, where he was a long-time general manager and won five titles, including the IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. In 2011, he was featured in the first interpromotional angle between IWA and WWC.

== Professional wrestling career ==
===Early years===
Rivera was born and raised in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. He was connected to the wrestling business while working as a security guard at World Wrestling Council live shows. After graduating from high school, he began his professional wrestling career working on independent wrestling shows in 1985.

===Mid-South Wrestling (1985)===
He made his Mid-South Wrestling debut on August 14, 1985, as Skandor Akbar&#x27;s newest client, the masked villainous wrestler &quot;El Corsario&quot; by defeating Mark Ragin. His debut match aired on the August 17 episode of &quot;Mid-South TV&quot;. As a member of Akbar&#x27;s Army, he frequently teamed with Akbar&#x27;s other clients. He also received a few title shots in Mid-South. The first title shot occurred against Butch Reed for the promotion&#x27;s Television Championship on the October 19 episode of &quot;Mid-South TV&quot;, but failed to win. On the October 26 episode of &quot;Power Pro Wrestling&quot;, Corsario and Dutch Mantell unsuccessfully challenged Al Perez and Wendell Cooley for the Tag Team Championship. Corsario finished his run with Mid-South on November 11 at a live event by teaming with Steve Williams in a loss to The Bruise Brothers. During that year he also wrestled for Houston Wrestling.

===Universal Wrestling Association (1986)===
In 1986, Rivera wrestled a few matches for the Mexican promotion Universal Wrestling Association as Corsario I and teamed with Corsario II. On August 8, Los Corsarios lost a masks versus masks two out of three falls match to Los Brazos (Brazo de Plata and El Brazo). Corsario would then wrestle for UWA two more times in two out of three falls matches, losing both matches.

===Capitol Sports Promotions (1987–1991)===
====Early championship reigns (1987–1989)====
After a few exploits in various promotions, Rivera went to Miami, Florida, where he tried out for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He was accepted and sent back to Puerto Rico to wrestle for the Capitol Sports Promotions (CSP) as &quot;TNT&quot;, adopting a Heel character based on his martial arts background and featuring several elements from stereotypical Hispanic gimmicks. He was managed by &quot;El Profe&quot; Ángel Pantoja Rivera. TNT made his CSP debut on May 2, 1987, by defeating Miguel Pérez to win the North American Heavyweight Championship, his first professional wrestling championship. On July 11, he became a dual champion, winning the World Tag Team Championship with Mr. Pogo by defeating The Youngbloods (Chris and Mark) and holding it for nineteen days, before losing it back to Youngbloods. TNT would then begin feuding with Pogo, defeating him in a match at Aniversario on September 20.

On January 30, 1988, TNT lost the North American Heavyweight Championship to Abdullah the Butcher. After the title loss, TNT participated in the La Copa Gillette tournament, in which he defeated Mr. Pogo in the first round, but fought Invader I to a time limit draw in the quarter-final. On June 18, he won the Caribbean Heavyweight Championship from Hercules Ayala. Two months later, he dropped it to Buddy Landel. After failing to regain the title from Landel in a rematch at Aniversario, TNT defeated Landel to win his second Caribbean Heavyweight Championship on September 17. TNT held the title for another two months before dropping it to Jason the Terrible. 

On February 4, 1989, he defeated Sika to win the vacant Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship, holding it for 21 days before losing it to Abbuda Dein. He defeated Jason the Terrible to win his third Caribbean Heavyweight Championship on March 4, and dropped it to Rip Rogers on May 14. On June 17, TNT defeated Carlos Colón to win the Television Championship. TNT would then begin feuding with Chicky Starr, whom he defeated in a gimmick versus hair match at Aniversario.

====Universal Heavyweight Champion, rights to TNT name and W*ING tours (1989–1991)====
During the last half of 1989, TNT had a midcard feud with Leo Burke, which was interrupted midway through when Burke defeated Carlos Colón for the Universal Heavyweight Championship. TNT was originally expected to win the belt, given his status as a fan favorite and solid wrestling skills. On February 9, 1990, he defeated Burke for the Universal Heavyweight Championship, marking the first world championship win of his professional wrestling career. As a result, TNT vacated the Television Championship. He held the Universal Heavyweight Championship for a month, before dropping it to Abdullah the Butcher. 

On April 25, 1990, TNT defeated rival Leo Burke to win his second Television Championship. A few months later, TNT turned heel and began feuding with Carlos Colón, who had won the Universal Heavyweight Championship from Abdullah the Butcher. This led to a match between the two for the title at Aniversario, where they wrestled to a sixty-minute draw. Later that year, TNT lost the Television Championship to Steve Strong on December 4.

In early 1991, he feuded with a wrestler who had originally used the name &quot;TNT&quot;, and began proclaiming himself &quot;Original TNT&quot;. On January 26, TNT lost to Original TNT in a match for the vacant Television Championship. However, TNT defeated Original TNT in a non-title match on March 2, winning the rights to the TNT name, forcing his opponent to compete as &quot;Action Jackson&quot;. The feud concluded later that month, when Rivera defeated Jackson to win his third Television Championship on March 30. On April 20, TNT lost the title to King Kong. On June 1, TNT defeated Kong to win his fourth Television Championship. At Aniversario, TNT teamed with The Giant Warrior to defeat Demolition (Crush and Smash). 

TNT would then embark on a tour of Japan for the upstart promotion Wrestling International New Generations (W*ING) in August, as part of a talent exchange partnership between CSP and W*ING. On August 7, TNT competed in the main event of W*ING&#x27;s first show, by teaming with Mr. Pogo and Steve Collins in a loss to Akitoshi Saito, Koichiro Kimura and Mitsuteru Tokuda. W*ING specialized in deathmatch wrestling style and TNT competed in various matches under the stipulation. On August 17, TNT lost a lumberjack deathmatch to Akitoshi Saito. TNT would then return to CSP to successfully defend the Television Championship against Samu on August 31. 

TNT would then make a second tour to W*ING in September. On September 19, TNT teamed with Pogo to defeat Saito and The Iceman in a Caribbean Hurricane Cage Deathmatch. TNT&#x27;s final match in W*ING took place on September 20, in which he defeated Yukihiro Kanemura. This would be TNT&#x27;s final appearance for W*ING, as he exclusively returned to compete for CSP. TNT would then lose the title to Fidel Sierra on October 19. TNT regained the title by defeating Sierra in a rematch on October 26, winning his fifth and final WWC Television Championship. TNT lost the title, a month later to Dick Murdoch on November 23. Shortly after, TNT left CSP.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1987–1988)===
On November 22, 1987, TNT debuted in the Japanese promotion All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) by teaming with Abdullah the Butcher to participate in the 1987 Real World Tag League, losing to Jumbo Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu in their AJPW debut. Abdullah and TNT scored twelve points in the Real World Tag League, and their participation in the tournament ended with a loss to Hiroshi Wajima and Giant Baba on December 11. Abdullah and TNT competed in several matches in AJPW in January 1988, including a title challenge against Ashura Hara and Genichiro Tenryu for the PWF World Tag Team Championship on January 9, 1988, in which the challengers came up short. They left AJPW after losing a match to Tsuruta and Yatsu on January 29.

===New Japan Pro Wrestling (1990–1993)===
On September 30, 1990, TNT made his debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling, by losing to Masahiro Chono at Antonio Inoki&#x27;s 30th Wrestling Anniversary event. TNT would make frequent tours to Japan to compete for NJPW between 1990 and 1993, competing as a gaijin. He wrestled major star Tatsumi Fujinami and rising stars Shinya Hashimoto and Keiji Mutoh in various singles matches. While he lost most of his singles matches, TNT would receive a few wins over Kengo Kimura and Black Cat. TNT&#x27;s final match in NJPW took place on July 23, 1993, where he teamed with Masa Saito against Brad Armstrong and Hercules Hernandez in a losing effort.

===Americas Wrestling Federation (1991–1993)===
After some disputes over booking with Carlos Colón, he quit the World Wrestling Council and joined the newly formed Americas Wrestling Federation a promotion that started opposition against World Wrestling Council. AWF Americas Heavyweight Championship on two times. Feuded with Bill DeMott and Huracan Castillo Jr..

===World Wrestling Federation (1993–1999)===
==== Kwang (1993–1995)====
Having gained much wrestling experience, Rivera was recalled to the United States. After losing two dark matches to Reno Riggins in the World Wrestling Federation as TNT in July 1993, Rivera debuted as Kwang on January 10, 1994. This gimmick incorporated clichéd elements previously used to portray mysterious &quot;Asian&quot; wrestlers and being billed from Japan, including a mask, a stereotypical martial arts moveset, and Asian mist. The WWF aired promotional vignettes in the weeks before his televised debut, which happened on January 22, 1994, when he, managed by Harvey Wippleman, was the fourth man to enter the 1994 Royal Rumble, marking Rivera&#x27;s pay-per-view debut. During the match, he teamed with the fifth entrant, Owen Hart, battling the face wrestlers to a stalemate until Diesel entered seventh and eliminated all the previous entrants.

Kwang&#x27;s televised singles debut was on the January 30 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, where he defeated Ray Hudson. On the April 18 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Kwang suffered his first loss in the WWF, against the WWF Champion Bret Hart. On the May 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he lost a King of the Ring qualifying match to Razor Ramon. On September 12, he lost to The Undertaker. On January 9, 1995, he was at ringside when Howard Finkel won a Tuxedo match against Wippleman, who then abandoned his role as Kwang&#x27;s manager. After an appearance in the 1995 Royal Rumble, where he would eliminate Doink the Clown, Kwang gradually faded from WWF programming, losing his final match to Hakushi on the April 29, 1995, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;.

====Alliance with Razor Ramon (1995–1996)====

On May 14, 1995, Rivera appeared in street clothes and grew a goatee during the WWF&#x27;s first In Your House pay-per-view. When Razor Ramon was attacked by Jeff Jarrett and The Roadie, Rivera, portraying a fan in the audience, jumped the guardrail to rescue him. Later that night, Razor introduced him as his childhood friend, &quot;Savio Vega&quot;.

Vega made his wrestling debut on the May 28 episode of &quot;Action Zone&quot;, defeating Eli Blu. He then qualified for the 1995 King of the Ring tournament as a replacement for the injured Razor Ramon. He qualified for the tournament by defeating Irwin R. Schyster on the June 25 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Slam&quot;. Vega then defeated Yokozuna by countout in the first round, after interference from Yokozuna&#x27;s tag partner, Owen Hart, backfired. He then defeated The Roadie with a rollup pinfall. He faced Mabel in the finals, losing after Mabel hit a splash off the ropes to win the tournament.

The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega defeated the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett by disqualification. Vega and Ramon would then feud with Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo), losing to them at In Your House 2. On the July 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega and Ramon wrestled Owen Hart and Yokozuna for the WWF Tag Team Championship to a time limit draw, then lost a rematch for the titles the next week. For the rest of the year, he wrestled in tag matches with Razor and Bob Holly, as well as in singles matches against wrestlers including Waylon Mercy, Sid and Goldust. On January 1, 1996, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega teamed with Razor, unsuccessfully challenging The Smoking Gunns for the Tag Team Championship in a Raw Bowl match. In March 1996, Vega and Razor teamed one last time losing to Tatanka and Razor&#x27;s former protege The 123 Kid and then afterwards Vega&#x27;s alliance with Razor quietly ended.

====Various feuds (1996–1997)====
Vega was the twelfth entrant in the 1996 Royal Rumble, eliminating Dory Funk, Jr. before being eliminated by Vader. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, he lost to Vader. On the March 11 &quot;Raw&quot;, he wrestled Stone Cold Steve Austin for the first time, resulting in a double countout. This led to a feud, and a series of matches. The first of these happened at WrestleMania XII, both men&#x27;s WrestleMania debut, which Austin won.

On the April 13 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, Rivera, wearing a mask featuring the flag of Puerto Rico and billed as &quot;The Caribbean Kid&quot;, defeated Austin by pinfall, then unmasked himself. This was Austin&#x27;s first singles defeat in the WWF, and The Caribbean Kid&#x27;s sole appearance. On the April 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega challenged Goldust for the Intercontinental Championship. Vega won the match, but WWF President Gorilla Moonson reverted the decision and vacated the title. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega and Goldust fought for the title, which was won by Goldust. Austin won a rematch at In Your House 7: Good Friends, Better Enemies on April 28. One month later, at In Your House 8: Beware of Dog, Vega defeated Austin in a Caribbean Strap Match. According to the stipulations, Austin&#x27;s manager, Ted DiBiase, had to leave the WWF. This was DiBiase&#x27;s last appearance on WWF television until 2005.

Vega then feuded with Justin Bradshaw, winning their first match on July 8. On July 21, he lost a rematch at In Your House 9: International Incident. On August 12, 1996, Vega lost his first match by submission to Crush. At SummerSlam, he lost a match to Owen Hart, and was then assaulted by Bradshaw. At In Your House 10: Mind Games, he defeated Bradshaw in a Caribbean Strap Match, ending their feud. During the match ECW originals The Sandman, Paul Heyman and Tommy Dreamer were in attendance because the event was held in Philadelphia where ECW originated in and Sandman spat beer in Vega&#x27;s face and the three were kicked out of the building.

On the September 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley. This was followed with a victory over the fake Razor Ramon, who had appeared following the original Razor&#x27;s departure to World Championship Wrestling. On the December 22 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, he teamed with Jesse James to unsuccessfully challenge Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith for the Tag Team Championship.

Vega entered the 1997 Royal Rumble, but was eliminated by eventual winner Stone Cold Steve Austin.

====The Nation of Domination (1997)====
On January 25, 1997, Vega turned heel and joined The Nation of Domination, a stable led by Faarooq, after turning on his partner, Ahmed Johnson. Johnson became the Nation&#x27;s main rival in the following months. In his first match as a member, he defeated Flash Funk. At In Your House 13: Final Four, he teamed with Faarooq and Crush to win a six-man tag match. In February, he lost consecutive matches by disqualification to Marc Mero and Goldust.

On March 17, 1997, Vega and Crush lost to The Legion of Doom by disqualification. At WrestleMania 13, they teamed with Faarooq to lose a six-man street fight tag match against the Legion of Doom and Johnson. On the next &quot;Raw&quot;, Vega lost to Johnson by disqualification when The Nation interfered.

Vega then feuded with Intercontinental Champion Rocky Maivia. Like Austin a year earlier, Maivia entered the feud as an undefeated prospect with a major push. On the April 14 &quot;RAW&quot;, Vega defeated Maivia by pinfall, while holding his tights. At In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker, he once again defeated Maivia, this time by countout. After the match, he attacked Maivia&#x27;s knee.

On May 11, at In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell, Vega wrestled as part of a gauntlet match against Johnson and was eliminated, before Faarooq won it for The Nation. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, he challenged The Undertaker for the WWF Championship, but was disqualified. On June 9, The Nation lost a rematch from WrestleMania 13 against Johnson and The Legion of Doom. After this, The Nation began having internal problems and soon disbanded, when Faarooq expelled several members, including Vega and Crush.

====Los Boricuas (1997–1999)====
Following his departure from The Nation of Domination, Vega formed his own stable, Los Boricuas, composed of Puerto Rican wrestlers, brought in from Puerto Rican promotions, all members of notable wrestling families. Miguel Pérez, Jr., a former Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling wrestler, is the son of Miguel Pérez, Sr., Jesús Castillo, Jr. is the son of Pedro &quot;Huracán&quot; Castillo, and Jose Estrada, Jr. is the son of José Estrada, Sr. Meanwhile, Faarooq had organized The Nation into a black-only group, while Crush had formed The Disciples of Apocalypse, a white biker stable, launching an angle which became known as &quot;The Gang Wars&quot;, based on ethnic stereotypes and loosely mirroring some actual gang wars. The three four-member teams wrestled against one another, with none gaining a clear advantage early on. At SummerSlam, Los Boricuas defeated The Disciples of Apocalypse. In the first singles match between former Nation members, Vega fought Crush to a no contest. At Ground Zero: In Your House on September 7, he defeated Faarooq and Crush in triple threat match. At the UK-exclusive pay-per-view, One Night Only, Vega and Pérez unsuccessfully challenged The Headbangers for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. At Badd Blood: In Your House, The Disciples defeated Los Boricuas. Between October and November, Vega also had singles matches, losing to Goldust, Mero and Ken Shamrock.
On the October 27 &quot;RAW&quot;, Vega and Pérez unsuccessfully challenged The Legion of Doom for the Tag Team Championship. In their next match, they lost to The New Age Outlaws. In December 1997, Los Boricuas and The Disciples exchanged victories.

His first singles contest of 1998 was a loss to Owen Hart. The next week, Vega and Pérez defeated Taka Michinoku and Scott Taylor. He was the 26th entrant in the 1998 Royal Rumble, and, like the year before, was eliminated by Steve Austin. In the Royal Rumble&#x27;s main event, Vega and Los Boricuas attacked the Undertaker alongside the New Age Outlaws to aid Shawn Michaels in defeating him in a casket match. Vega headlined No Way Out of Texas: In Your House on February, when he replaced the injured Shawn Michaels in the eight-man tag main event, teaming with Triple H and the New Age Outlaws in a losing effort. On the March 9 &quot;Raw&quot;, he wrestled Triple H to a no contest.

At WrestleMania 14, Vega wrestled in a battle royal, won by Legion of Doom 2000. A week later, Los Boricuas lost to LOD 2000. The Gang Wars continued with matches against The Disciples in April. On May 4, Rivera lost to the NWA World Champion, Dan Severn.

The Gang Wars came to an end when the leaders of the three stables faced off in a triple threat match, which Vega won. After the angle, Los Boricuas splintered into two tag teams. On July 6, Vega defeated Brakkus in a Brawl for All tournament boxing match. On August 10, he lost a quarterfinal match to Darren Drozdov. As a result of a severe arm injury sustained from the Brawl for All tournament, he was released in August 1998. 

Vega returned to WWF television in July 1999. He would make a number of appearances on &quot;WWF Super Astros&quot;, and would participate in WWF Shotgun and WWF Jakked/Metal dark matches (sometimes with other Boricua members). During this time, he provided commentary at the Spanish announce table at the Fully Loaded PPV and several episodes of Monday Night Raw. He was released again from his WWF contract in September 1999.

On December 15, 1999, Rivera defeated Prince Albert at an International Wrestling Association house show in Puerto Rico. The IWA was a new promotion founded by Víctor Quiñones, which was one of WWF&#x27;s developmental territories.

=== International Wrestling Association (1999–2011)===
Rivera joined the now independent IWA, upon returning to Puerto Rico. He wrestled as Savio Vega, though often ended feuds by wearing war paint in the final matches and changing his wrestling persona to &quot;El Hombre Dinamita&quot; (a reference to his &quot;TNT&quot; gimmick, which the WWC had trademarked and did not allow him to use).

On July 16, 2001, Vega defeated Jesus Castillo, his former Los Boricuas stablemate and now a member of a stable called &quot;Los Intocables&quot; with Miguel Pérez, for the IWA Hardcore Championship. He was forced to vacate the title after being unable to wrestle. Eventually, he turned on his former allies and became general manager, forming a heel stable called &quot;La Compañia&quot; (The Company), which included Apolo and Ricky Banderas, whom he called his &quot;Dream Team&quot;.

Vega was depicted as co-owner of the IWA, though he had no real share in the company. As general manager, he was more often a manager than a wrestler. Under this authoritarian gimmick, he introduced his catchphrase, &quot;A mi manera o pa&#x27; la calle&quot;, (roughly, &quot;My way or the highway&quot;), with which he threatened to fire wrestlers, and occasionally did so. He would &quot;discipline&quot; wrestlers by mugging them in a mob, while singing a traditional Puerto Rican bomba, &quot;Santa María&quot;. Later in 2001, he allied with the main heel stable in the promotion, The Starr Corporation, composed of Chicky Starr, Víctor Rodríguez and Ricky Banderas. At Christmas in PR 2001, Vega and The Starr Corporation turned on Banderas and Shane, who teamed as Los Hermanos en Dolor, and feuded with Banderas. The Starr Corporation remained on his side until a conflict arose between them, leading Vega to expel Laureano from the IWA.

On March 2, 2002, Vega used his authority to award himself the IWA World Heavyweight Championship, eventually dropping it to Figueroa. Los Boricuas reunited later that year, when Pérez joined Vega to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship. In November 2002, Vega was injured by Banderas, and was absent for two weeks. When he returned, he pursued the support of Banderas, granting him a title match against Figueroa on January 6, 2003, in which he turned heel and joined La Compañia, who feuded with Figueroa, Vega bringing in foreign wrestlers to incapacitate him.

Banderas led La Compañia for several months, until Rey Fénix joined, triggering a power struggle in which Vega supported Fénix. Vega and Fénix defeated Banderas and Rodríguez in tag matches. After winning the initial feud in a match at Golpe de Estado 2003, Fénix revealed his true identity, Ray González, and abandoned La Compañia. Now joined by a heel Figueroa and Slash Venom, Vega feuded with González and his stable, La Familia del Milenio. This new faction had several matches against Figueroa &amp; Kindred and Pérez &amp; Castillo. At Golpe de Estado 2003, Rivera wrestled Huertas González to a no contest, due to a large amount of bleeding from both. On November 15, 2003, Kindred and Vega attacked Banderas following a match, and he was rescued by Vampiro, starting a new feud for La Compañia.

At Hardcore Weekend 2003, Rivera returned to his &quot;El Hombre que ellos llaman TNT&quot; persona, wrestling against Huertas González. To close the year, Rivera was fired by José Chaparro, who went on to take over the general manager office acting on behalf of the IWA&#x27;s CEO, Thomas Wreckler. Víctor &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; Rodríguez emerged as the self-proclaimed leader of La Compañia during his absence. In June 2004, a storyline to bring Rivera back was run, in which the CEO, Thomas Wreckler, brought him in to stop La Familia and La Compañia. However, this storyline was interrupted by the death of Rodríguez due to a heart attack, and he unsuccessfully attempted to regain control of the general manager by challenging González at Summer Attitude. On July 25, 2004, Rivera reformed La Compañia. In August 2004, González was involved in an angle in which he won 49% of IWA&#x27;s stocks. He then entered a feud with the owner of the remaining 51%, Víctor Quiñones. On August 28, 2004, at Bad Blood, González announced that from that moment onwards, IWA would be known as &quot;Capitol Sports Promotions&quot;, claiming that Quiñones had already received documentation confirming this. González then began recruiting Huertas González to join him, claiming that their origin in &quot;Capitol joins them&quot;. In September 2004, somebody assaulted Huertas González backstage, leaving behind Rivera&#x27;s trademark bat. It was subsequently revealed that the culprit was &quot;Lighting&quot; acting on González behalf, just when Huertas González was about to join the &quot;Capitol&quot; faction.

On October 9, 2004, González announced that &quot;Capitol&quot; had formed an alliance with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling-NWA for Golpe de Estado and that this move would bring in NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett, Robert Roode, Konnan and Shawn Hernandez. Immediately after completing this announcement, Rivera proposed that they bet the stocks at Golpe de Estado with the winner taking full control of both halves of the promotion, which was accepted. On October 14, 2004, with the score tied between &quot;Capitol&quot; and IWA, he defeated González ending the name change angle. At Christmas in PR 2004, González dropped the title to Sewell in a match ordered by him. On the other hand, Rivera himself teamed with Huertas González to challenge for the World Tag Team Championship. However, he turned on Huertas González and joined Sewell, turning La Compañia heel. Following this, Rivera took a random Canadian heel character, replacing his traditional outfit featuring the Flag of Puerto Rico to one sporting the Flag of Canada. He feuded with González throughout 2005. Both formed different tag teams with members of their stable, exchanging victories. On June 18, 2005, Rivera won a singles match over González. He subsequently brought Miguel &quot;Mr. Big&quot; Maldonado to La Compañia to serve as his personal bodyguard. On November 11, 2005, Rivera defeated Carlos Cotto to win his second World Heavyweight Championship. Later that month he retained in a leather strap match. A third match between them that featured José Huertas González as referee was declared a no contest. However, on January 6, 2006, he lost to González in a &quot;loser leaves the company&quot; match, losing a final contest against Huertas González before leaving. This was the second time that Rivera&#x27;s role as general manager was overthrown and it was followed by a storyline which was run where Pérez had fired him and vignettes were aired where he was seen as a homeless man. Orlando Toledo, a nephew of the now-defunct Quiñones was introduced as the new general manager. A fictional election was held between Pérez and him, which Rivera won but was nullified due to him lacking a contract, making way to a new villainous president in Toledo. Upon being &quot;reinstated&quot;, Rivera went on to feud with González and Sewell, forming a loose cooperation with Toledo. He went on to form a tag team along Huertas González known as &quot;Los Inhumanos&quot;, when the former turned heel. Their union eventually dissolved and evolved into a feud, which saw Huertas González defeating Rivera in a &quot;death match&quot;, his retirement contest for the IWA.

====Los Autenticos and feud with Chris Angel (2006–2011)====

Rivera eventually make amends with Pérez and joined him along Babderas and Sewell in order to feud with González and Toledo&#x27;s Estrellas. Following a tag team match that went no contest in February 2007, his team won six consecutive matches against the heel factions. Rivera himself defeated Estrellas&#x27; members Kafu, Mikael Judas and the &quot;Colossus&quot; Michael Jarvis. He and Cotto formed a regular tag team to feud with Jarvis and Judas, earning a 2-1 advantage. Rivera went on to defeat Jarvis twice and get disqualified against Kafu leading to Summer Attitude 2007. Subsequently, Rivera joined Sewell to form a tag team, winning two matches against the Estrellas. He then entered a feud against Figueroa, with both of their matches going inconclusive. He remained in a feud with Toledo&#x27;s Estrellas stable until early 2007, when the former left the company following an event where Rivera sided with Pérez when a conflict between him and Mario Savoldi. Upon retaking his role as general manager, he became the leader of a new heel stable known as &quot;Los Auntenticos&quot; along Pérez and Ricky Vega. This faction was quickly involved in an angle dealing with a power struggle against several other stables within the company. In his first match following a forced hiatus, Los Autenticos got disqualified in a match against González and Figueroa. They went on to defeat &quot;Los Rabiosos&quot;, composed by Freddie &quot;Blitz&quot; Lozada and Maldonado. Rivera entered a feud against Lozada, after the former teamed with Ricky Vega to defeat Los Autenticos. On June 14, 2008, he defeated Vega. Rivera went then entered a feud with Bison Smith, losing twice. On October 4, 2008, he wrestled The Sheik to a no contest. The stable eventually grew to include Rivera&#x27;s younger brother Dennis Rivera and his tag team partner Noel Rodríguez. Los Auntenticos would then create a &quot;terror list&quot; where the names of former WWC employees were written. This list was used in a new angle were the stable would ambush and attack wrestlers that were randomly selected from the list. At Golpe de Estado, Los Autenticos lost in a Boricua Rumble match, before winning their following appearance. As a sidetrack, Rivera ran a mock campaign to become Governor of Puerto Rico for the fictional Partido Luchador Puertorriqueño (PLP) prior to the 2008 general elections. The closure to the Loteria del Terror came when the other members turned on Rivera and Pérez, citing that &quot;they themselves were part of Capitol once&quot;, igniting a sibling rivalry against Dennis Rivera who was supported by Noel Rodríguez and Richard Rondón. The feud continued with matches between both, Los Autenticos lost two tag team matches against this team, known as &quot;La Malicia&quot;. In matches between brothers, the result was a no contest and a win by Dennis Rivera. Concurrently, he entered a second feud against Joe Bravo and his own stable, &quot;La Compañia Elite&quot;. Rivera and Pérez won a match against two lowcard members of La Compañia. At the IWA&#x27;s 10th Anniversary show, he wrestled Bravo to a no contest, with the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship being held up. Rivera lost the rematch.

In August 2009, he won a handicap match over Rondón and Rodríguez and teamed to defeat La Compañia. He went on to defeat Bravo and Edwin Vázquez Ortega in consecutive matches. Following this, Rivera once again turned heel, teaming with Gilbert, facing a stable known as &quot;La Cruz del Diablo&quot;. Dennis Rivera eventually returned to his side citing that &quot;blood is heavier than water&quot;. He won consecutive matches over Bravo at the Copa José Miguel Pérez and Summer Attitude. Rivera joined his brother in defeating The Bad Boys from Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, also winning singles contests over Keith Walker and Sonny Roselli. In June 2010, Rivera was contacted by Hugo Savinovich in order to become involved in an angle with IWA&#x27;s main rival, WWC. Savinovich serves as the producer of Aniversario, the WWC&#x27;s main annual event. While still in negotiation, Rivera appeared in a talk show along Carlos Colón. Promotion of the angle began here by staging a spot where he criticized Carly Colón&#x27;s supposed addiction to painkillers, prompting Colón to leave the stage. This marked the first time that both performed together in over a decade, following the lawsuit filled by WWC over the TNT character. During the following weeks, Rivera continued this line by issuing two challenges in IWA events, as well as changing the name of his finisher to &quot;La Painkiller&quot;. At Summer Attitude 2010, Rivera defeated World Wrestling Entertainment employee Bryan Danielson, then IWA Puerto Rico Heavyweight Champion and first contender to the WWE United States Championship, by pinfall following his finishing move. Later that night, he sanctioned a contest for the belt between his brother and Danielson, which was won by the younger Rivera. Rivera then entered a feud with Álvarez, who had served as special referee at Summer Attitude 2010 and made his in-ring debut in the IWA, winning the contest between them. Rivera went on to win two more matches over midcard talent before entering a lengthy hiatus. Returning in winter, he confronted &quot;The Academy&quot;, a group that had entered the IWA two months earlier that was harassing Pérez. At Christmas in PR 2010, Rivera wrestled and lost to one of The Academy&#x27;s members, the debuting Chris Angel for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. A rematch was scheduled for Histeria Boricua 2011, which was promoted with a throwback angle in which he emphasized how having defeated other undefeated wrestlers such as Austin and Johnson, claiming that his loss at Christmas in PR was nothing but a fluke. Regardless of this, Angel won the rematch and eventually went on to become an undefeated world champion. Upon exiting the ring following the loss, Pérez confronted Rivera and told him not to return until he had &quot;returned to his roots&quot;.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2008–2009)===
In July 2008, Rivera began working as a road agent for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. In January 2009, he became head agent for the promotion&#x27;s women&#x27;s division, known as the TNA Knockouts. He also served as the unofficial trainer for the division during this tenure. On July 31, 2009, Rivera was released from his contract.

===Return to TNA (2011–2012)===

====Ring Ka King (2011–2012)====
In late 2011, Rivera was rehired by TNA, this time to work with Ring Ka King, a TNA affiliate promotion in India. Along with Jeff Jarrett and Dutch Mantell, he was responsible for training the Indian wrestlers at Ohio Valley Wrestling, TNA&#x27;s developmental territory in Louisville, Kentucky.

===International promotions (2007–2013)===
While wrestling in the IWA, he competed in Revolution X-treme Wrestling based in Panama, performing in a battle royal to determine the winner of the vacant RXW World Heavyweight Championship, where he won the event. In January 2008, he began an international tour. This tour began with a presentation in Boston for Power House Wrestling Of New England. And continued with a visit to Ecuador where he would defend the Wrestling Alliance Revolution Tag Team Championship. The tour concluded in Panama where he defended the company&#x27;s title against Ricky Banderas. In PHW he participated in a tag team match, where he teamed with a wrestler using the name Don Vega. They defeated a team that included the company&#x27;s heavyweight champion. He would then compete in &quot;WAR Conquest 2008&quot;, a special event organized by Wrestling Alliance Revolution. In this event he defended the company&#x27;s tag team championship along Condor Ortíz, in a match that they lose after Ortíz accidentally kicked Vega. Following the match he turned on Ortíz, and subsequently challenged Kuervo, the company&#x27;s heavyweight champion to a title match on the event. The encounter happened later in card, and Kuervo retained by disqualification after Vega spat green mist on his face. During the following summer Vega alternated his work between the IWA, Division One Pro Wrestling (D1PW) in Florida and Nu-Wrestling Evolution in Spain. Vega retained the RXW championship twice in June, against Ricky Vega and PJD. On March 21, 2009, Vega defended and lost the RXW World Heavyweight Title in a rematch against Panama Jack Daniels. Vega was released from his TNA contract on July 31, 2009. On October 2, 2009, Vega participated in a Wrestling Alliance Revolution card, defeating AP Dynamite for the WAR World Heavyweight Championship. On November 1, 2009, Vega and Pérez participated in a Dominican Wrestling Entertainment card, being booked to win the DWE World Tag Team Championship. They dropped the title on DWE&#x27;s final event of the year, Cierre de Temporada, held on December 20, 2009.

On a Ring Ka King episode aired on February 11, 2012, Rivera returned to his T.N.T. character as part of his work as trainer for TNA. His opponent was an Indian wrestler called Jwala. None of the wrestlers were given a definitive heel or face role, but the local crowd supported his compatriot Jwala, who earned the pinfall by avoiding a maneuver by Rivera and applying his own finisher. He returned under the same guise on the March 24, 2012, RKK episode joining Nick Dinsmore in an eight-man tag team contest joining the Sheiks against the teams of Barood &amp; Romeo Rapta and the Bollywood Boys. His team performed as the unambiguous heels, gaining the victory by employing illegal tactics.
Vega became BSP World Heavyweight Champion by defeating Emperador Maximus on January 26, 2013, in La Barra in Caguas, PR. On April 28, 2013, Vega retained the BSP World Title by defeating Lloyd Samoa in Cayey, PR despite the outside interference from the challenger&#x27;s manager Octavio 5to (Victor Manuel Sierra Garcia) and the BSP director of operations Alexis Baez. On July 7, 2013, Vega retained the BSP World Heavyweight Championship by defeating number one contender &quot;Dimes&quot; at its Summer Splash event held in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico. On July 20, 2013, Vega lost the BSP World Heavyweight Championship to Dimes at Summer Splash &quot;La Revancha&quot;, held in Gurabo, Puerto Rico, after the challenger threw white powder in his face and then hit Vega with a pair of brass knuckles. After the match, Vega issued his rematch clause. On August 31, 2013, Vega lost to BSP World Heavyweight Champion Menace and Dimes in a three-way dance match celebrated in el sector La Jurado in Caguas, PR.

===Interpromotional angles (2011–2014)===

Rivera remained completely absent from any wrestling-related activity for several months as a consequence. He reappeared on the final edition of WWC&#x27;s Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre show before Aniversario 2011, interrupting the programming by stepping into the camera while wearing an IWA shirt. At the actual event, he led a large group of IWA wrestlers, including incumbent Undisputed World Champion Hiram Tua, who promptly invaded the WWC ring, beating down the WWC Tag Team Champions, Wilfredo &quot;Lynx&quot; Rivera and Alejandro &quot;Niche&quot; Marrero. This event became known as &quot;El Bombazo&quot;, referencing his original gimmick and the explosive nature of actual TNT. Rivera himself addressed the crowd and issued another challenge to Colón who responded in a subsequent interview issuing a challenge of his own. The WWC responded by entering the IWA&#x27;s next event, Summer Attitude and vandalizing Quiñones&#x27; Hall of Fame induction. Despite this, the negotiations between the promotions were stalled and no further actions were taken for the remainder of 2011. At Halloween Mayhem 2011, Rivera returned to IWA for the first time since Histeria Boricua 2011, turning on a heel Pérez and seizing control by regaining the office of general manager and joining the still-undefeated Angel and Phillip Davian to form a stable known as &quot;La Academia Gerencial&quot;. The group stayed away from action for the remainder of the year due to him working the RKK project for TNA in OVW and India and he named an interim general manager who performed the role at Histeria Boricua 2012. Prior to the WWC&#x27;s Euphoria 2012 event, Rivera reappeared in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, supporting Ricky Banderas in his contest against Colón. He eventually costed Colón the match, playing a video stating that the &quot;hunting had begun&quot; that lasted for the remainder of the scheduled time.

Concurrently, Pérez had launched a second interpromotional angle, this time involving the third largest company in Puerto Rico, the Extreme Wrestling Organization. Rivera himself remained uninvolved with this, holding a reunion with La Academia Gerencial. However, Angel and Davian left the promotion in February while he was working outside of Puerto Rico, disbanding the stable. Consequently, Rivera sided with the IWA upon returning, assaulting EWO employees at Clash of the Titans 2012. During this visit, he also participated in an event of a smaller independent company, New Revolution Wrestling, winning its heavyweight championship. On May 26, 2012, Rivera reappeared in the IWA and issued a challenge to EWO CEO Richard Rondón to a winner-takes-all match at Juicio Final. However, the event was postponed due to unspecified circumstances and the IWA&#x27;s partnership with EWO was subsequently dissolved. In July 2012, Rivera began an independent tour, making appearances in International Gladiators Wrestling Alliance and the Puerto Rico Wrestling Association. He had previously wrestled in some shows of IGWA&#x27;s predecessor, Lucha Libre Extrema Internacional. On October 7, 2012, Rivera reappeared in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, issuing yet another challenge. However, this time Colón backfired with a challenge of his own, inviting him to a special edition of Carlito&#x27;s Cabana. The edition of the talk show that featured Rivera took place on October 14, 2012. In the segment, both traded insults and it finished with the security removing him when he tried to assault Colón after the former spat an apple in his face. At Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza, Rivera reappeared and once again addressed the crowd before being removed from the facilities by Victor Jovica. At Honor vs Traición Rivera was summoned to a face to face by Jovica. At Lockout 2012 Vega served as special referee in the hair vs hair match between Ray Gonzalez and Carlito. On the November 9, 2013, episode of Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, the return of Rivera as T.N.T. was announced. At Crossfire, on November 16, 2013, Vega defeated Chris Angel to win the WWC Universal Championship. However, he lost the title to Mighty Ursus at Lockout. TNT won the title back on January 19, 2014. On March 30, 2014, at Hora de la Verdad, TNT defeated Apolo to win the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. On July 19, 2014, TNT lost the title against Carlito Caribbean Cool. In October 2014, Vega left WWC.

===World Wrestling League (2014–2015)===
On October 10, 2014, after being previously advertised for the Aniversario event of WWC on October 25, 2014, and booked to win the WWC Puerto Rico Championship, Vega suddenly announced via his Facebook fan page that he was no longer under a WWC contract, thus being officially pulled from the event. The following day on October 11, 2014, he announced on his page he was now part of the Puerto Rican-based promotion World Wrestling League. Vega took on the role of WWL&#x27;s tyrannus director of operations. After being fired by president Richard Negrín, he came back with Shane Sewell to attack Negrín and his heel stable and claim that his contract was for 5 years and that if he got fired, he would own 75% of the company. However, on March 23, 2015, WWL founder Negrín retired from pro wrestling and closed WWL. WWL reopened later, but Savio had already left.

=== Late career (2015–present) ===
After leaving the WWL, Savio Vega returned to local promotions where he has been regularly active in BSP, CWA, &amp; NRW also makes international appearances in countries like Kuwait, and appeared in September and October on Amaro Production and Game Changer Wrestling.

On November 22, 2020, he made an appearance at Survivor Series during The Undertaker&#x27;s retirement ceremony.

On July 10, 2021, he wrestled at Major League Wrestling&#x27;s Battle Riot III entering twice in the match (as Savio Vega and Kwang).

Vega and Carlito appeared at Backlash on May 6, 2023, to assist the Latino World Order&#x27;s Bad Bunny in his San Juan street fight match against The Judgment Day&#x27;s Damian Priest.

<doc id="1182314" wikidata="Q1193808" url="?curid=1182314" title="Norwegian Americans">
<text>Norwegian Americans () are Americans with ancestral roots in Norway. Norwegian immigrants went to the United States primarily in the latter half of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th century. There are more than 4.5 million Norwegian Americans, according to the 2021 U.S. census; most live in the Upper Midwest and on the West Coast of the United States.

==Immigration==

===Viking-era exploration===

Norsemen from Greenland and Iceland were the first Europeans to reach North America. Leif Erikson reached North America via Norse settlements in Greenland around the year 1000. Norse settlers from Greenland founded the settlement of L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Vinland, in what is now Newfoundland, Canada. These settlers failed to establish a permanent settlement because of conflicts with indigenous people and within the Norse community.

=== Colonial settlement ===

The Netherlands, and especially the cities of Amsterdam and Hoorn, had strong commercial ties with the coastal lumber trade of Norway during the 17th century and many Norwegians immigrated to Amsterdam. Some of them settled in Dutch colonies, although never in large numbers. There were also Norwegian settlers in Pennsylvania in the first half of the 18th century, upstate New York in the latter half of the same century, and in New England during both halves.

During the colonial period, Norwegian immigrants often joined the Dutch seeking opportunities for trade and a new life in America. The Dutch often took Norwegians with them to the New World for their sailing expertise. There was a Norwegian presence in New Amsterdam in the early part of the 17th century. Hans Hansen Bergen, a native of Bergen, Norway, was one of the earliest settlers of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, having immigrated in 1633. Another early Norwegian settler, Albert Andriessen Bradt, arrived in New Amsterdam in 1637.

Approximately 60 people had settled in the Manhattan area before the region was taken over by the British Empire in 1664. The total number of Norwegians that settled in New Netherland is not known. In the period that followed, many of the original Norwegian settlers in the area remained, including the family of Pieter Van Brugh, a colonial mayor of Albany, who was the grandson of early Norwegian immigrants.

=== 19th century ===
Many immigrants during the early 1800s sought religious freedom. From the mid-1800s however, the driving forces behind Norwegian immigration to the United States were agricultural disasters which led to poverty, from the European Potato Failure of the 1840s to the Famine of 1866–68. The agricultural revolution also put farmers out of work and pushed them to seek employment in a more industrialized America.

====Religious migration====
The earliest immigrants from Norway to America emigrated mostly for religious motives, especially as members of the Religious Society of Friends or as Haugeans. To a great extent, this early emigration from Norway was born out of religious persecution, especially for Quakers and a local religious group, the Haugeans.

Organized Norwegian immigration to North America began in 1825, when several dozen Norwegians left Stavanger bound for North America on the sloop &quot;Restauration&quot; (often called the &quot;Norse &quot;Mayflower&quot;&quot;). Under the leadership of Cleng Peerson, the &quot;Restauration&quot; left Stavanger in July 1825 and ferried six families on a 14-week journey. The ship landed in New York City, where it was at first impounded for exceeding its passenger limit. After intervention from President John Quincy Adams, the passengers moved on to settle in Kendall, New York with the help of Andreas Stangeland, witnessing the opening of the Erie Canal en route. After making the journey to Kendall, Cleng Peerson became a traveling emissary for Norwegian immigrants and died in a Norwegian Settlement near Cranfills Gap, Texas in 1865. The descendants of these immigrants are referred to as &quot;Sloopers&quot;, in reference to the sloop ship that brought them from Norway. Many of the 1825 immigrants moved on from the Kendall Settlement in the mid-1830s, settling in Illinois and Wisconsin. These &quot;Sloopers&quot; gave impetus to the westward movement of Norwegians by founding a settlement in the Fox River area of Illinois. A small urban colony of Norwegians had its genesis in Chicago at about the same time.

====Organized immigration====
While about 65 Norwegians emigrated via Sweden and elsewhere in the intervening years, no emigrant ships left Norway for the New World until the 1836 departures of the &quot;Den Norske Klippe&quot; and &quot;Norden&quot;. In 1837, a group of immigrants from Tinn emigrated via Gothenburg to the Fox River Settlement, near present-day Sheridan, Illinois. It was the writings of Ole Rynning, who traveled to the U.S. on the &quot;Ægir&quot; in 1837 that energized Norwegian immigration, however.

Throughout much of the latter part of the 19th century and into the 20th century, a vast majority of Norwegian emigration to both the United States and Canada followed a route commonly shared by most Swedish, Danish and Finnish emigrants of the period, being via England by means of the monopoly established by the leading shipping lines of Great Britain, primarily the White Star Line and the Cunard Line, both of which operated chiefly out of Liverpool, England. These lines negotiated with smaller &#x27;feeder lines&#x27;, primarily the Wilson Line, which was based out of the port city of Hull on England&#x27;s east coast, to provide emigrants with passage from port cities such as Christiania (present-day Oslo), Bergen and Trondheim to England via Hull. Steamship companies such as Cunard and White Star included fares for passage on these feeder ship in their overall ticket prices, along with railroad fares for passage between Hull and Liverpool and temporary accommodations in numerous hotels owned by the shipping lines in port cities such as Liverpool.

Most Norwegian emigrants bound for the United States entered the country through New York City, with smaller numbers coming through other eastern ports such as Boston and Philadelphia. Other shipping lines such as the Canadian Pacific Line, which operated chiefly out of Liverpool, and the Glasgow-based Anchor Line operated routes to ports in eastern Canada, primarily Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax. Because Canadian-bound routes were slightly shorter, lines which disembarked at Canadian ports often provided quicker passages and cheaper fares. The Canadian route offered many advantages to the emigrant over traveling to the U.S. directly. &quot;They moved on from Quebec both by rail and by steamer for another thousand or more miles (1,600 km) for a steerage fare of slightly less than $9.00.&quot; Steamers from Quebec, Canada brought them to Toronto, Canada then the immigrants often traveled by rail for 93 miles to Collingwood, Ontario, Canada on Lake Huron, from where steamers transported them across Lake Michigan to Chicago, Milwaukee and Green Bay. Not until the start of the 20th century did Norwegians accept Canada as a land of the second chance. This was also true of the many American-Norwegians who moved to Canada seeking homesteads and new economic opportunities. By 1921, one-third of all Norwegians in Canada had been born in the U.S.

Between 1825 and 1925, more than 800,000 Norwegians immigrated to North America—about one-third of Norway&#x27;s population with the majority immigrating to the U.S., and lesser numbers immigrating to the Dominion of Canada. With the exception of Ireland, no single country contributed a larger percentage of its population to the United States than Norway. Data from the U.S. Office of Immigration statistics of the number of Norwegians obtaining lawful permanent resident status in the U.S. from 1870 to 2016 highlights two peaks in the migration flow, the first one in the 1880s, and the second one in the first decade of the 20th century. It also shows an abrupt decrease after 1929, during the economic crisis of the 1930s.

==== Settlement ====
 Beginning in 1836, Norwegian immigrants arrived in significant numbers annually. From the early &quot;slooper&quot; settlement in Illinois, Norwegian pioneers followed the general spread of population northwestward into Wisconsin. Wisconsin remained the center of Norwegian American activity up until the American Civil War, a war in which a number of Norwegian Americans fought for the Union, such as in the 15th Wisconsin Volunteer Regiment. In the 1850s Norwegian land seekers began moving into both Iowa and Minnesota, and serious migration to the Dakotas was underway by the 1870s.

Norwegian immigration through the years was predominantly motivated by economic concerns. Compounded by crop failures, Norwegian agricultural resources were unable to keep up with population growth, and the Homestead Act of 1862 promised fertile, flat land. As a result, settlement trended westward with each passing year. The majority of Norwegian agrarian settlements developed in the northern region of the so-called Homestead Act Triangle between the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers. Early Norwegian settlements were in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Illinois, but moved westward into Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. Later waves of Norwegian immigration went to the Western states such as Montana, Washington, Oregon, and Utah through missionary efforts which gained Norwegian and Swedish converts to Mormonism. Additionally, craftsmen also immigrated to a larger, more diverse market. Until recently, there was a Norwegian area in Sunset Park, Brooklyn originally populated by Norwegian craftsmen.

The upper Midwest became home to most immigrants. In 1910 almost 80 percent of the one million or more Norwegian Americans lived in that part of the United States. In 1990, 51.7 percent of the Norwegian American population lived in the Midwest. At that time, Minnesota had the largest Norwegian American population and Minneapolis functioned as a hub for Norwegian American secular and religious activities.

In the Pacific Northwest, the Puget Sound region, and especially the city of Seattle, became another center of immigrant life. Enclaves of Norwegian immigrants emerged as well in greater Brooklyn, New York, in Alaska, and Texas. After Minnesota, Wisconsin had the most Norwegians in 1990, followed by California, Washington, and North Dakota.

== Cultural identity ==

=== 19th century ===

In a letter from Chicago dated November 9, 1855, Elling Haaland from Stavanger, Norway, assured his relatives back home that &quot;of all nations Norwegians are those who are most favored by Americans.&quot; Svein Nilsson, a Norwegian-American journalist recorded that &quot;A newcomer from Norway who arrives here will be surprised indeed to find in the heart of the country, more than a thousand miles from his landing place, a town where language and way of life so unmistakably remind him of his native land.&quot;

This sentiment was expressed frequently as the immigrants attempted to seek acceptance and negotiate entrance into the new society. In their segregated farming communities, Norwegians were spared direct prejudice and might indeed have been viewed as a welcome ingredient in a region&#x27;s development. Still, a sense of inferiority was inherent in their position. The immigrants were occasionally referred to as &quot;guests&quot; in the United States and they were not immune to condescending and disparaging attitudes by old-stock Americans. Economic adaptation required a certain amount of interaction with a larger commercial environment, from working for an American farmer to doing business with the seed dealer, the banker, and the elevator operator. Products had to be grown and sold—all of which pulled Norwegian farmers into social contact with their American neighbors. In Pennsylvania a group of Norwegians flew a flag described as: &quot;The Cross of Norway in the centre, surrounded by the Stars and Stripes of the United States.&quot;

Norwegian-American debating societies provided opportunities for immigrants to discuss and debate issues of the day in an atmosphere conducive to learning while also developing skills useful in American life. Beginning in 1889, both the &quot;Wig Debate Society&quot; and &quot;Forward Debate Society&quot;, located in Minnesota, hosted weekly debates. Many topics were discussed including voting rights, women&#x27;s rights, and racism. These societies helped to develop friendship and understanding.

In places like Brooklyn, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle, Norwegian-Americans interacted with the multi-cultural environment of the city while constructing a complex ethnic community that met the needs of its members. It might be said that a Scandinavian melting pot existed in the urban setting among Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes, evidenced in residential and occupational patterns, in political mobilization, and in public commemoration. Inter-marriage promoted inter-ethnic assimilation. There are no longer any Norwegian immigrant enclaves or neighborhoods in America&#x27;s great cities. Beginning in the 1920s, Norwegian-Americans increasingly became suburban.

=== 20th century ===
Norwegian Americans cultivated bonds with Norway, sending gifts home often and offering aid during natural disasters and other hardships in Norway. Relief in the form of collected funds was forthcoming without delay. Only during conflicts within the Union between Sweden and Norway, however, did Norwegian Americans become involved directly in the political life of Norway. In the 1880s they formed societies to assist Norwegian liberals, collecting money to assist rifle clubs in Norway should the political conflict between liberals and conservatives call for arms. The ongoing tensions between Sweden and Norway and Norway&#x27;s humiliating retreat in 1895 fueled nationalism and created anguish. Norwegian Americans raised money to strengthen Norway&#x27;s military defenses. The unilateral declaration by Norway on June 7, 1905, to dissolve its union with Sweden yielded a new holiday of patriotic celebration.

In American popular culture, Norwegian Americans were the central characters in the popular CBS network television series, &quot;Mama&quot; (1949–1956). Set in San Francisco around 1900, the weekly program focused on working-class family life. They also form the background to Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Lake Wobegon&quot; series of novels as well as &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, a radio variety show that contains much humorous material from the &quot;Norwegian American Midwest&quot;.

According to a 2018 paper, Norwegian immigrants who lived in large ethnic enclaves in the United States in the 1910 and 1920 &quot;had lower occupational earnings, were more likely to be in farming occupations, and were less likely to be in white-collar occupations.&quot;

== Traditions ==
Today, the traditions practiced by Norwegian Americans are distinct from those practiced in modern-day Norway. Norwegian Americans are primarily descendants of 19th or early 20th century working class and rural Norwegians, and the traditions which these immigrants brought with them represented a specific segment of the Norwegian population and cultural period. As these traditions continued to evolve in an American context, they are today divergent from that of modern-day Norway.

Norwegian Americans actively celebrate and maintain their heritage in many ways. Much of these traditions center upon Lutheran-Evangelical church communities. Other organizations, such as the Sons and Daughters of Norway and the Chicago Norske Klub also serve to preserve their ethnic heritage. Culinary customs (e.g., &quot;lutefisk&quot; and &quot;lefse&quot;), national dress (&quot;bunad&quot;), and Norwegian holidays (&quot;Syttende Mai&quot;) are also popular. Some regional festivals celebrate Norwegian heritage, predominantly in areas with a high density of Norwegian Americans, such as Norsk Høstfest (English&quot;:&quot; &quot;Norwegian Autumn Festival&quot;), an annual festival held in Minot, North Dakota. In 1925, the Norse-American Centennial celebration was held at the Minnesota State Fair.

A number of towns in the United States, particularly in the Upper Midwest, are known for their display of Norwegian heritage, including: Stoughton, Wisconsin; Sunburg, Minnesota; Ulen, Minnesota; and Westby, Wisconsin. Starbuck, Minnesota is known to produce the largest lefse in the world. Other regions known for their Norwegian heritage or origins include: Norge, Virginia; Petersburg, Alaska; Poulsbo, Washington; and Lapskaus Boulevard, the nickname of 8th Avenue in Brooklyn.

There are a number of museums commemorating the Norwegian-American immigrant experience. Norskedalen is a natural and cultural heritage site near Coon Valley, Wisconsin, spread over 440 acres which exhibits the Norwegian immigrant experience of the late 1800s. Little Norway, Wisconsin is a living museum of a Norwegian village located in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. The National Nordic Museum in the Ballard, a district Seattle heavily settled by Scandinavian immigrants, serves as a community gathering place. The Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum in Decorah, Iowa is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to the experiences of a single immigrant population and has an extensive collection of Norwegian-American artifacts. Chapel in the Hills is an exact replica of the Borgund stave church in Norway, located in Rapid City, South Dakota. The church&#x27;s site also maintains other period typical historical buildings.

==Religion==
Although today Norway is relatively secular, Norwegian-Americans are among the most religious ethnic groups in the United States, with 90% acknowledging a religious affiliation in 1998. Because membership to the State Church was mandatory until the 19th century in Norway, all ethnic Norwegians have traditionally been Lutheran. Today, many Norwegian Americans remain Lutheran, though significant numbers converted to other Christian denominations. Some Norwegians immigrated to the United States in hope of practicing other religions freely. A significant number of Norwegian immigrants and their descendants were Methodists concentrated especially in Chicago, with its own theological seminary, while others converted to become Baptists. There were also groups of Quakers, relating back to &quot;the Sloopers,&quot; and Mormons who joined the trek to the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; in Salt Lake City, Utah.

=== Norwegian Lutheranism ===
Most Norwegian immigrants to the United States, particularly in the migration wave between the 1860s and early 20th century, were members of the Church of Norway, an evangelical Lutheran church established by the Constitution of Norway. As they settled in their new homeland and forged their own communities, however, Norwegian-American Lutherans diverged from the state church in many ways, forming synods and conferences that ultimately contributed to the present Lutheran establishment in the United States. The Norwegian Lutheran church was a focal point in rural settlements in the Upper Midwest. The congregation became an all-encompassing institution for its members, creating a tight social network that touched all aspects of immigrant life. The force of tradition in religious practice made the church a central institution in the urban environment as well. The severe reality of urban life increased the social role of the church. 

The official State Church in Norway did not extend pastoral care to emigrants and provided no guidance in the formation of new congregations in the United States. The Church of Norway was seen as an integrated part of the Norwegian state administration with no particular responsibility for people outside of Norway, with the exception of sailors and those who remained citizens. As a consequence, no fewer than 14 Lutheran synods were founded by Norwegian immigrants between 1846 and 1900. In 1917 most of the factions reconciled doctrinal differences and organized the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America. It was one of the church bodies that in 1960 formed the American Lutheran Church, which in 1988 became a constituent part of the newly created Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

=== Norwegian Lutheran colleges ===
Several Lutheran colleges and higher education institutions were founded by Norwegian Americans, which retain a Norwegian lutheran identity today. Luther College, located in Decorah, Iowa was founded by Norwegian immigrants in 1861 and is today associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota is also associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and was founded by Norwegian settlers in 1891. Other Norwegian Lutheran colleges include: Augsburg University, Augustana College, Bethany Lutheran College, Pacific Lutheran University, St. Olaf College, and Waldorf College.

==Language usage==

Use of the Norwegian language in the United States was at its peak between 1900 and World War I, then declined in the 1920s and 1930s. Over one million Americans spoke Norwegian as their primary language from 1900 to World War I, and more than 3,000 Lutheran churches in the Upper Midwest used Norwegian as their sole language. There were hundreds of Norwegian-language newspapers across the Upper Midwest.
*&quot;Decorah Posten&quot; and &quot;Skandinaven&quot; were major Norwegian language newspapers.
*&quot;The Northfield Independent&quot; was another notable newspaper. The editor was Andrew Rowberg, who collected massive numbers of Norwegian births and deaths in U.S. The file he created is now known as The Rowberg File Maintained at St. Olaf College, and is commonly used in family research across the U.S. and Norway.
*Over 600,000 homes received at least one Norwegian newspaper in 1910.

However, use of the language declined in part due to the rise of nationalism among the American population during and after World War I. During this period, readership of Norwegian-language publications fell. Norwegian Lutheran churches began to hold their services in English, and the younger generation of Norwegian Americans were encouraged to speak English rather than Norwegian. When Norway itself was liberated from Nazi Germany in 1945, relatively few Norwegian Americans under the age of 40 still spoke Norwegian as their primary language (although many still understood the language). As such, they were not passing the language on to their children, the next generation of Norwegian Americans.

Some sources stated that today there are 81,000 Americans who speak Norwegian as their primary language. According to the U.S. Census however, only 55,475 Americans spoke Norwegian at home as of 2000, and the American Community Survey in 2005 showed that only 39,524 people use the language at home. Still, most Norwegian Americans can speak a common Norwegian with easy words like hello, yes and no. Today, there are still 1,209 people who only understand Norwegian or who do not speak English well in the United States. In 2000 this figure was 215 for those under 17 years old, whereas it increased to 216 in 2005. For other age groups, the numbers went down. For those who are from 18 to 64 years old, went down from 915 in 2000 to 491 in 2005. For those who are older than 65 years it went drastically down from 890 to 502 in the same period. The Norwegian language is likely to never die out in the U.S. because there is still immigration, of course on a much smaller scale, but they often emigrate to other areas, like Texas, where the number of Norwegian speakers increase.

Many Lutheran colleges that were established by immigrants and people of Norwegian background, such as Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, and St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, continue to offer Norwegian majors in their undergraduate programs. Many major American universities, such as the University of Washington, University of Oregon, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the Indiana University offer Norwegian as a language within their Germanic language studies programs.

Two Norwegian Lutheran churches in the United States continue to use Norwegian as a primary liturgical language, Mindekirken in Minneapolis and Minnekirken in Chicago. There are also several Norwegian Seaman&#x27;s Churches in the U.S. that have services in Norwegian. They are located in Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, New Orleans, and New York.

Literary writing in Norwegian in North America includes the works of Ole Edvart Rølvaag, whose best-known work &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; (&quot;I de dage&quot;, literally &quot;In Those Days&quot;) was published in both English and Norwegian versions. Rølvaag was a professor from 1906 to 1931 at St. Olaf College, where he was also head of the Norwegian studies department beginning in 1916.

<doc id="1182319" wikidata="Q1144525" url="?curid=1182319" title="Goat Island (New York)">
<text>Goat Island (previously called Iris Island) is a small island in the Niagara River, in the middle of Niagara Falls between the Bridal Veil Falls and the Horseshoe Falls. The island is at the southwest corner of the City of Niagara Falls (and of Niagara County), New York, in the United States and is part of Niagara Falls State Park.

Goat Island has no residents but is a destination for tourists visiting the falls on the U.S. side. It has several viewing points, including Terrapin Point. Goat Island is connected to the U.S. mainland by two bridges that carry foot, car, and trackless train traffic, and to the smaller Luna Island (adjacent to the American Falls) by a pedestrian bridge. Goat Island is largely wooded and is interlaced with foot trails. The Cave of the Winds tour elevator provides access down to the foot of the falls.

==Geology==

The island was formed during the recent retreat of the falls as it cut inward (upstream) through the Niagara Escarpment. The Niagara River&#x27;s channel splits in two above the falls, creating two sets of falls, one on either side of the island. In 1959–60, the island&#x27;s eastern side was extended about for additional parking and a helicopter pad. Fill was provided from excavation for the construction of the Robert Moses State Parkway. In 1954–1955 the area between the Terrapin Rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point.

In the early 1980s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether of the Horseshoe Falls was eliminated, including on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada. Other sources say &quot;most of&quot; Horseshoe Falls is in Canada.

The island&#x27;s western end is slowly being eroded by the falls, and the entire island will eventually disappear as the falls erode further upstream. The waters around Goat Island are relatively shallow and studded with islets and rocks, many of them scenes of dramatic rescues and rescue attempts.

==History==
John Stedman—an early pioneer and miller—kept a herd of goats on the island. Upon returning to the island after the terrible winter of 1780, he found all but one of them had died, thus giving the island its name.

The island&#x27;s preservation as parkland is due to the early efforts of Augustus Porter, who in the middle 19th century recognized the long-term value of the falls as a tourist attraction. Porter purchased the island and allowed a group of Tuscarora Native Americans to live on it and sell their crafts to the tourists who came to the falls by stagecoach and early railroads. In spite of pressure, Porter refused to tame the environment on the island. In 1817, he built a toll bridge to the island for tourists. It was swept away by ice, so another was built the following year downstream. Basil Hall called it &quot;one of the most singular pieces of engineering in the world&quot;. Almost seven hundred feet long, it soon became the region&#x27;s best-travelled walkway.

In 1885, the island was included in the Niagara Reservation State Park which is the oldest state park in the U.S.

=== Tesla Monument ===
The island is home to the Tesla Monument which honors the Serbian-American inventor, Nikola Tesla. The statue was given to the United States by the government of Yugoslavia in 1976. The statue&#x27;s sculptor is Frano Kršinić (1897–1982), a renowned Yugoslav sculptor. In mid-2016, the statue was moved to Stedman&#x27;s Bluff, the section of the island that overlooks the Bridal Veil Falls and the American Falls, to increase popularity.

==Botany==
In 1879, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, wrote that he had travelled four thousand miles throughout the continent &quot;without finding elsewhere the same quality of forest beauty which was once abundant about the falls, and which is still to be observed in those parts of Goat Island where the original growth of trees and shrubs had not been disturbed...&quot; Olmsted concluded that the spray from the Falls created a natural nursery for indigenous plant life. Since that time, regular mowing of the Goat Island meadow, heavy foot traffic, and the incursion of invasive species have significantly changed the island&#x27;s floral landscape.

==In fiction==
Part of H. G. Wells&#x27;s 1908 novel &quot;The War in the Air&quot; is set on Goat Island. During the fictional invasion of the U.S. by the forces of Imperial Germany, depicted in the book, the protagonist is stranded on the island, with bridges to the mainland having been destroyed in the fighting, and is involved in a grim battle for survival with two equally stranded German soldiers.

<text>Mass operations of the People&#x27;s Comissariate of Internal Affairs (NKVD) were carried out during the Great Purge and targeted specific categories of people. As a rule, they were carried out according to the corresponding order of the People&#x27;s Commissar of Internal Affairs Nikolai Yezhov.

==National operations of the NKVD==
The operations of this type in this period targeted &quot;foreign&quot; ethnicities (ethnicities with cross-border ties to foreign nation-states), unlike nationally targeted repressions during World War II. According to historian Oleg Khlevniuk, Stalin became concerned about rearguard uprisings that were seen in the Spanish Civil War and believed that &quot;nationalities of foreign governments&quot; posed a threat in border regions, even if they were Soviet citizens whose ancestors had sometimes lived decades or centuries in the areas controlled by the Soviet Union.

Minutes of the January 31, 1938 Politburo meeting list the following ethnicities against which NKND operations were to be continued: Poles, Latvians, Germans, Estonians, Finns, Greeks, Iranians, Harbinites, Chinese, and Romanians. It was also suggested to carry out similar NKVD operations against Bulgarians and Macedonians.

From August 1937 to October 1938, 353,513 people were arrested and 247,157 were shot in the national operations of NKVD. It is estimated that this would make up 34% of the total victims of the Great Purge.

* Polish Operation of the NKVD ~111,091 killed 
** NKVD Order No. 00485
* German Operation of the NKVD ~41,898 killed
* Greek Operation of the NKVD 20,000—50,000 killed or disappeared
* Latvian Operation of the NKVD 16,573 killed
* Korean Operation of the NKVD ~40,000 killed
* Chinese Operation of the NKVD 3,932 killed
* Estonian Operation of the NKVD 4,672 killed
* Finnish Operation of the NKVD 8,000–25,000 killed or disappeared
* Harbin Operation of the NKVD ~30,992 Harbin Russians were killed

==Other==
* NKVD Order No. 00447, an operation to repress ex-kulaks, criminals, and other anti-Soviet &quot;elements&quot; 
* Family members of traitors to the Motherland

==Rollback==
On November 17, 1938 a joint decree No. 81 of Sovnarkom USSR and Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation and the subsequent order of the NKVD undersigned by Lavrentiy Beria canceled most of NKVD orders of mass type (but not all, see, e.g., NKVD Order No. 00689) and suspended implementation of death sentences, signifying the end of the Great Purge (&quot;Yezhovshchina&quot;).

<text>The EMD GP30 is a four-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division of La Grange, Illinois between July 1961 and November 1963. A total of 948 units were built for railroads in the United States and Canada (2 only), including 40 cabless B units for the Union Pacific Railroad.

It was the first so-called &quot;second generation&quot; EMD diesel locomotive, and was produced in response to increased competition by a new entrant, General Electric&#x27;s U25B, which was released roughly at the same time as the GP30. The GP30 is easily recognizable due to its high profile and stepped cab roof, unique among American locomotives. A number are still in service today in original or rebuilt form.

==History==

===Development===
The GP30 was conceived out of the necessity of matching new competitor GE&#x27;s U25B. The U25B offered while EMD&#x27;s GP20 and its 567D2 prime mover was only rated at . The U25B also featured a sealed, airtight long hood with a single inertial air intake for electrical cooling, with a pressurized cooling system which kept dust out of the engine and equipment area. Finally, the entire GE design was optimized for ease of access and maintenance. The U25B demonstrators were receiving much praise—and orders—from the railroads that tested them. Meanwhile, ALCO had been producing the 2,400 hp (1,800 kW) RS-27 since 1959, though it had not sold well.

EMD&#x27;s engineering department pushed their DC traction system for an extra . The wasn&#x27;t quite equivalent to the GE and ALCO offerings, but EMD hoped the railroads&#x27; familiarity with EMD equipment would improve their chances. The locomotive in which the 16 cylinder, 567D3 would be fitted, was improved along the lines of the U25B; sealed long hood, central air intake, and engineered for easier maintenance access. The frame and trucks of the GP20 were carried across; the extra equipment for the centralized air system required more space behind the cab, and since the locomotive was not going to be lengthened, extra space was achieved vertically by raising the height of the locomotive, giving room for the central air system, turbocharger and electrical cabinet all behind the cab. This extra height behind the cab meant that the body style used for previous GP units was not suitable.

Since EMD wanted the new locomotive to be visibly modern and updated, they turned to the GM Automotive Styling Center at Troy, Michigan for help. The automobile stylists created the GP30&#x27;s trademark &quot;hump&quot; and cab roof profile. The hump-like bulge started at the front of the cab and enveloped the air intakes for the central air system and the dynamic brake blister. Units ordered without dynamic brakes were the same shape, but lacked the intakes to cool the dynamic brake resistor grids.

A high short hood could be ordered, but only holdouts Norfolk and Western Railway and Southern Railway received such units. EMD originally planned to name the locomotive the GP22, but EMD&#x27;s marketing department decided to leapfrog GE&#x27;s numbering to make the new locomotive seem more advanced. Marketing literature claimed 30 distinct improvements from the GP20 and that this was the reason for the number.

===Sales and in service===
The GP30 successfully countered the GE threat and kept EMD in the dominant position in the North American diesel market. While losing a little power to the GE and ALCO competition, the solidity and reliability of the GP30—and the familiarity of railroad mechanical departments with EMD products—ultimately won many more orders for EMD. 948 were sold, in comparison to 476 U25Bs. In addition, the GP30 was only sold until the end of 1963, while the U25B was available until 1966.

Most major railroads ordered GP30s, and many smaller ones did too. The largest orders were from the SOU (120), UP (111), ATSF (85), and the B&amp;O (77).

The sole purchaser of B units (by the mid-1960s generally an outdated concept) was the UP, who kept the practice of running its locomotives in matched sets much longer than others. Thirteen of those GP30B units were fitted with steam generators for heating passenger trains, the only GP30s to receive them. Prior to Amtrak, UP would use a GP30 and two boiler equipped GP30Bs on passenger trains when no E8s or E9s were available.

Some units for the GM&amp;O, MILW and SOO were built using trucks from ALCO trade-ins and therefore ride on AAR type B trucks instead of the EMD standard Blomberg Bs. An indisputable tribute to the quality of the GP30 design is the fact that a good number are still in service as of 2015, which is a service lifespan of over 50 years and well in excess of the design life of 25–30 years for the average diesel locomotive. Furthermore, when life-expired, some railroads chose to give them major rebuilds instead of scrapping them.

== Original buyers ==

===Cab-equipped &#x27;A&#x27; units===
===Cabless booster &#x27;B&#x27; units===
==Rebuilds==

The Burlington Northern Railroad was the most extensive user of rebuilt GP30s. Finding a need for modernized units of lower power, it sent GP30s—-both its own and units purchased from other railroads-—to be rebuilt to the specifications of the later GP39. Seventy units were sent to EMD, 65 to Morrison Knudsen (now Washington Group International) and 25 to VMV for rebuilding, and the rebuilds are known as GP39E, GP39M, and GP39V respectively. The changes included new generators, Dash-2 modular electronic control systems and 567D3 engines upgraded with EMD 645-series power assemblies, rated at 2,300 hp (1,720 kW) and designated 12-645D3. Some of these units received new EMD spartan cabs. These units are still in service on locals and smaller lines throughout the BNSF Railway system.

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) had previously performed a similar upgrade in its own Cleburne, Texas shops, stripping the locomotives down to bare metal and rebuilding with new equipment. The 567D3 engines were upgraded to a 2500-horsepower rating by the use of 645-series power assemblies. The generators and traction motors were upgraded and control and electrical equipment was replaced. The trucks received Hyatt roller bearings and single-shoe brake systems. Rooftop air conditioners and new horns were added. The locomotives were repainted in the blue and yellow &quot;Yellowbonnet&quot; scheme, and designated GP30u (for &quot;upgraded&quot;). 78 of these survived until the BNSF merger, and were eventually all sold off. In 2016, BNSF traded Larry&#x27;s Truck and Electric (LTEX) 26 GP38s for 24 of the Ex-ATSF GP30u&#x27;s for their GP39-3 rebuild program. The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad acquired a total of 6 of the former BNSF/ATSF GP30u&#x27;s from LTEX and designates them as GP39RN locomotives.

The Soo Line Railroad rebuilt three GP30s with CAT 3516 engines rated at . These were designated GP30C.

The Illinois Central Gulf Railroad rebuilt two GP30s in the early 1980s. These units were designated GP26. , the units remain in service on the Cimarron Valley Railroad.

The Chessie System rebuilt its GP30 units into GP30Ms, adding newer components, new traction motors and reducing their power to 2000 hp. They lasted with CSX into the mid-to-late 1990s, long after Seaboard System GP30s had been sold, retired and scrapped, or turned into road slugs.

==Preservation==
Many GP30s have been preserved by a variety of museums, societies and tourist railways. All preserved examples are cab units, as the cabless booster units have been scrapped. A number of these preserved locomotives are in operational condition. The following is a list of preserved GP30s in North America.

<text>Joseph Philip Robert Murray (born March 6, 1943) is a Canadian retired police officer who served as the 19th commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) from 1994 to 2000.

== Early years ==
Murray was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and joined the RCMP in 1962. He spent his early career in Saskatchewan.

He attended the University of Regina, where he was awarded the General Proficiency Scholarship in both 1975 and 1976, a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1977 and a Certificate in Business Administration in 1978. 

== Rising in the ranks ==
Murray became an Inspector in 1979, then joined the A Division in Ottawa. He was made Superintendent in charge of VIP Security and Airport Security in 1986.

He then became Chief Superintendent and Assistant Commissioner in 1988 and finally Deputy Commissioner in the early 1990s before becoming Commissioner in 1994.

== Commissioner of RCMP (1994–2000) ==
During his service as commissioner, Murray established town hall meetings to improve communication within the Force and initiated corporate sponsorship. In 1997 he ended the RCMP&#x27;s responsibility for airport security, leaving it to local police establishments and private security agencies. He adopted Alternative Dispute Resolution and developed the Mission, Vision, and Values/Shared Leadership Statement which guides the force today.

Murray officially retired from the RCMP in 2000.

<text>In finance, a surety , surety bond, or guaranty involves a promise by one party to assume responsibility for the debt obligation of a borrower if that borrower defaults. Usually, a surety bond or surety is a promise by a person or company (a &quot;surety&quot; or &quot;guarantor&quot;) to pay one party (the &quot;obligee&quot;) a certain amount if a second party (the &quot;principal&quot;) fails to meet some obligation, such as fulfilling the terms of a contract. The surety bond protects the obligee against losses resulting from the principal&#x27;s failure to meet the obligation.

== Overview ==
A surety bond is defined as a contract among at least three parties:

* the &quot;obligee&quot;: the party who is the recipient of an obligation
* the &quot;principal&quot;: the primary party who will perform the contractual obligation
* the &quot;surety&quot;: who assures the obligee that the principal can perform the task

European surety bonds can be issued by banks and surety companies. If issued by banks they are called &quot;Bank Guaranties&quot; in English and &quot;Cautions&quot; in French, if issued by a surety company they are called surety / bonds. They pay out cash to the limit of guaranty in the event of the default of the Principal to uphold his obligations to the Obligee, without reference by the Obligee to the Principal and against the Obligee&#x27;s sole verified statement of claim to the bank.

Through a surety bond, the surety agrees to uphold—for the benefit of the obligee—the contractual promises (obligations) made by the principal if the principal fails to uphold its promises to the obligee. The contract is formed so as to induce the obligee to contract with the principal, i.e., to demonstrate the credibility of the principal and guarantee performance and completion per the terms of the agreement.

The principal will pay a premium (usually annually) in exchange for the bonding company&#x27;s financial strength to extend surety credit. In the event of a claim, the surety will investigate it. If it turns out to be a valid claim, the surety will pay and then turn to the principal for reimbursement of the amount paid on the claim and any legal fees incurred. In some cases, the principal has a cause of action against another party for the principal&#x27;s loss, and the surety will have a right of subrogation to &quot;step into the shoes of&quot; the principal and recover damages to make up for the payment to the principal.

If the principal defaults and the surety turns out to be insolvent, the purpose of the bond is rendered nugatory. Thus, the surety on a bond is usually an insurance company whose solvency is verified by private audit, governmental regulation, or both.

A key term in nearly every surety bond is the &quot;penal sum&quot;. This is a specified amount of money which is the maximum amount that the surety will be required to pay in the event of the principal&#x27;s default. This allows the surety to assess the risk involved in giving the bond; the premium charged is determined accordingly.

Surety bonds also occur in other situations, for example, to secure the proper performance of fiduciary duties by persons in positions of private or public trust.

== History ==
Individual surety bonds represent the original form of suretyship. The earliest known record of a contract of suretyship is a Mesopotamian tablet written around 2750 BC. Evidence of individual surety bonds exists in the Code of Hammurabi and in Babylon, Persia, Assyria, Rome, Carthage, among the ancient Hebrews, and (later) in England. The Code of Hammurabi, written around 1790 BC, provides the earliest surviving known mention of suretyship in a written legal code.

Suretyship was not always accomplished through the execution of a bond. Frankpledge, for example, was a system of joint suretyship prevalent in medieval England which did not rely upon the execution of bonds.

The first corporate surety, the Guarantee Society of London (whose insurance business ultimately merged into Aviva), dates from 1840.

In 1865, the Fidelity Insurance Company became the first US corporate surety company, but the venture soon failed.

In 1894 the US Congress passed the Heard Act, which required surety bonds on all federally funded projects. The US Supreme Court held in 1896, in &quot;Prairie State Bank v United States&quot;, that an equitable claim by a surety to percentages of payment retained by the US government had priority over the claim of an assignee/lender.

In 1908 the Surety Association of America, now the Surety &amp; Fidelity Association of America (SFAA), was formed to regulate the industry, promote public understanding of and confidence in the surety industry, and to provide a forum for the discussion of problems of common interest to its members. SFAA is a licensed rating or advisory organization in all states and is designated by state insurance departments as a statistical agent for the reporting of fidelity and surety experience. The SFAA is a trade association consisting of companies that collectively write the majority of surety and fidelity bonds in the United States. Then in 1935 the Miller Act was passed, replacing the Heard Act. The Miller Act is the current federal law mandating the use of surety bonds on federally funded projects.

==Reason for having a guarantor==
A surety most typically requires a guarantor when the ability of the primary obligor, or &quot;principal&quot;, to perform its obligations to the obligee (counterparty) under a contract is in question or when there is some public or private interest that requires protection from the consequences of the principal&#x27;s default or delinquency. In most common law jurisdictions, a contract of suretyship is subject to the Statute of Frauds (or its equivalent local laws) and is unenforceable unless it is recorded in writing and signed by the surety and by the principal.

== United States industry ==
The SFAA published preliminary US and Canadian H1 surety results for the 2022 calendar year. Direct written premium totaled $8.6 billion and a direct loss ratio of 14.5%, highlighting strong profitability in the surety industry. The industry remains highly fragmented with over 100 companies directly writing surety bonds with new market entrants entering or reentering on a fairly common basis.

 annual US surety bond premiums amounted to approximately $3.5 billion. State insurance commissioners are responsible for regulating corporate surety activities within their jurisdictions. The commissioners also license and regulate brokers or agents who sell the bonds. These are known as producers; the National Association of Surety Bond Producers (NASBP) is a trade association which represents this group.

In 2008, the New York Times wrote &quot;posting bail for people accused of crimes in exchange for a fee, is all but unknown in the rest of the world&quot;.

===Miller Act===
The Miller Act may require a surety bond for contractors on certain federal construction projects; in addition, many states have adopted their own &quot;Little Miller Acts&quot;. 
The surety transaction will typically involve a producer; the National Association of Surety Bond Producers (NASBP) is a trade association that represents such producers.

==Right of subrogation==
If the surety is required to pay or perform due to the principal&#x27;s failure to do so, the law will usually give the surety a right of subrogation, allowing the surety to &quot;step into the shoes of&quot; the principal and use the surety&#x27;s contractual rights to recover the cost of making payment or performing on the principal&#x27;s behalf, even in the absence of an express agreement to that effect between the surety and the principal.

==Distinction between a suretyship arrangement and a guaranty==
Traditionally, a distinction was made between a suretyship arrangement and that of a guaranty. In both cases, the lender gained the ability to collect from another person in the event of a default by the principal. However, the surety&#x27;s liability was joint and primary with the principal: the creditor could attempt to collect the debt from either party independently of the other. The guarantor&#x27;s liability was ancillary and derivative: the creditor first had to attempt to collect the debt from the debtor before looking to the guarantor for payment. Many jurisdictions have abolished that distinction, in effect putting all guarantors in the position of the surety.

== Contract surety bonds ==
Contract bonds, used heavily in the construction industry by general contractors as a part of construction law, are a guaranty from a surety to a project&#x27;s owner (obligee) that a general contractor (principal) will adhere to the provisions of a contract. The Associated General Contractors of America, a United States trade association, provides some information for their members on these bonds. Contract bonds are not the same thing as contractor&#x27;s license bonds, which may be required as part of a license.

Included in this category are bid bonds (guaranty that a contractor will enter into a contract if awarded the bid); performance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will perform the work as specified by the contract); payment bonds (guaranty that a contractor will pay for services, particularly subcontractors and materials and particularly for federal projects where a mechanic&#x27;s lien is not available); and maintenance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will provide facility repair and upkeep for a specified period of time). There are also miscellaneous contract bonds that do not fall within the categories above, the most common of which are subdivision and supply bonds. Bonds are typically required for federal government projects by the Miller Act and state projects under &quot;little Miller Acts&quot;. In federal government, the contract language is determined by the government. In private contracts the parties may freely contract the language and requirements. Standard form contracts provided by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) make bonding optional. If the parties agree to require bonding, additional forms such as the performance bond contract AIA Document 311 provide common terms.

Losses arise when contractors do not complete their contracts, which often arises when the contractor goes out of business. Contractors often go out of business; for example, a study by BizMiner found that of 853,372 contracts in the United States in 2002, 28.5% had exited business by 2004. The average failure rate of contractors in the United States from 1989 to 2002 was 14% versus 12% for other industries.

Prices are as a percentage of the penal sum (the maximum that the surety is liable for) ranging from around 1% to 5%, with the most credit-worthy contracts paying the least. The bond typically includes an indemnity agreement whereby the principal contractor or others agree to indemnify the surety if there is a loss. In the United States, the Small Business Administration may guaranty surety bonds; in 2013 the eligible contract tripled to $6.5 million.

== Commercial surety bonds ==

Commercial bonds represent the broad range of bond types that do not fit the classification of contract. They are generally divided into four sub-types: license and permit, court, public official, and miscellaneous.

=== License and permit bonds ===

License and permit bonds are required by certain federal, state, or municipal governments as prerequisites to receiving a license or permit to engage in certain business activities. These bonds function as a guaranty from a Surety to a government and its constituents (obligee) that a company (principal) will comply with an underlying statute, state law, municipal ordinance, or regulation.

Specific examples include:
* Contractor&#x27;s license bonds, which assure that a contractor (such as a plumber, electrician, or general contractor) complies with laws relating to his field. In the United States, bonding requirements may be at federal, state, or local level.
* Customs bonds, including importer entry bonds, which assure compliance with all relevant laws, as well as payment of import duties and taxes. 
* Tax bonds, which assure that a business owner will comply with laws relating to the remittance of sales or other taxes. 
* Reclamation and environmental protection bonds
* Broker&#x27;s bonds, including insurance, mortgage, and title agency bonds
* ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) bonds
* Motor vehicle dealer bonds
* Freight broker bonds
* Money transmitter bonds
* Health spa bonds, which assure that a health spa will comply with local laws relating to their field, as well as refund dues for any prepaid services in the event the spa closes.

=== Court bonds ===
Court bonds are those bonds prescribed by statute and relate to the courts. They are further broken down into judicial bonds and fiduciary bonds. Judicial bonds arise out of litigation and are posted by parties seeking court remedies or defending against legal actions seeking court remedies. Fiduciary, or probate, bonds are filed in probate courts and courts that exercise equitable jurisdiction; they guaranty that persons whom such courts have entrusted with the care of others&#x27; property will perform their specified duties faithfully.

Examples of judicial bonds include appeal bonds, supersedeas bonds, attachment bonds, replevin bonds, injunction bonds, mechanic&#x27;s lien bonds, and bail bonds. Examples of fiduciary bonds include administrator, guardian, and trustee bonds.

=== Public official bonds ===
Public official bonds guarantee the honesty and faithful performance of those people who are elected or appointed to positions of public trust. Examples of officials sometimes requiring bonds include: notaries public, treasurers, commissioners, judges, town clerks, law enforcement officers, and credit union volunteers.

=== Miscellaneous bonds ===
Miscellaneous bonds are those that do not fit well under the other commercial surety bond classifications. They often support private relationships and unique business needs. Examples of significant miscellaneous bonds include: lost securities bonds, hazardous waste removal bonds, credit enhancement financial guaranty bonds, self–insured workers compensation guaranty bonds, and wage and welfare/fringe benefit (trade union) bonds.

== Business service bonds ==
Business service bonds are surety bonds which seek to safeguard a bonded entity&#x27;s clients from theft. These bonds are common for home health care, janitorial service, and other companies who routinely enter their homes or businesses. While these bonds are often confused with fidelity bonds, they are much different. A business service bond allows the bonded entity&#x27;s client to claim on the surety bond when the client&#x27;s property has been stolen by the bonded entity. However, the claim is only valid if the bonded entity&#x27;s employee is convicted of the crime in a court of law. Additionally, if the surety company pays a claim on the bond, they would seek to be reimbursed by the bonded entity for all costs and expenses incurred as a result of the claim. This differs from a traditional fidelity bond where the insured (bonded entity) would be responsible for paying the deductible only in the case of covered claim up to the policy limit.

== Penal bonds ==

The penal bond is another type of the bond that was historically used to assure the performance of a contract. They are to be distinguished from surety bonds in that they did not require any party to act as surety—having an obligee and obligor sufficed. One historically significant type of penal bond, the penal bond with conditional defeasance, printed the bond (the obligation to pay) on the front of the document and the condition which would nullify that promise to pay (referred to as the indenture of defeasance—essentially, the contractual obligation) on the back of the document. The penal bond, although an artifact of historical interest, fell out of use by the early part of the nineteenth century in the United States.

== Electronic surety bonds ==
In certain situations, an electronic surety bond (ESB) can be used in lieu of a traditional paper surety bond. In 2016, the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and Registry (NMLS) initiated a system for the issuance, tracking, and maintenance of ESBs in support of some licenses being managed through the NMLS. This new online system speeds bond issuance and decreases paperwork, among other potential benefits.

=== Timeline ===
The NMLS ESB initiative began on January 25, 2016, when surety bond companies and providers were able to begin the account creation process. The second phase began on September 12, 2016, when an initial group of nine state regulatory agencies began accepting ESBs for certain license types. This initial rollout included agencies in Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

On January 23, 2017, another group of twelve state agencies were added to allow ESB capability for certain license types. This group included agencies in Alaska, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and South Dakota. Minor upgrades were also completed early in 2017. The types of licenses transitioning to ESBs and the implementation timelines vary by licensing agency. The NMLS plans to roll out additional state agencies and update the system with added functionality over time.

<doc id="1182345" wikidata="Q2093198" url="?curid=1182345" title="Undercover Brother">
<text>Undercover Brother is a 2002 American satirical spy action comedy blaxploitation film directed by Malcolm D. Lee and starring Eddie Griffin. The screenplay by John Ridley and Michael McCullers is based on the Internet animated series created by Ridley. It spoofs blaxploitation films of the 1970s as well as a number of other films, most notably the James Bond franchise. The film also stars former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Chris Kattan and comedian Dave Chappelle as well as Aunjanue Ellis, Neil Patrick Harris, Denise Richards, and Billy Dee Williams, and features a cameo by James Brown.

== Plot ==
The film begins with a backstory of how African-American culture&#x27;s popularity with the American public began to decline in the 1980s, when style and originality began to lose appeal in the public eye due to the persistent efforts of &quot;The Man&quot;, a powerful Caucasian man in control of a secret organization that seeks to undermine the African-American community as well as the cultures of other minorities. The Man is infuriated that Gen. Warren Boutwell, a United States Army general (based on Colin Powell), is considering running for president, and his lackey Mr. Feather informs him of a mind-control drug which The Man uses to make Boutwell abort his plans and instead open a fried chicken franchise. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a secret organization that battles The Man&#x27;s influence, determines The Man is behind Boutwell&#x27;s change of heart, and recruits a freelance spy named Undercover Brother to aid them.

Undercover Brother joins B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D.&#x27;s leadership, made up of the Chief, Conspiracy Brother, Smart Brother and Sistah Girl. Also tagging along is Lance, an intern who is the only white man in the organization hired due to affirmative action. Undercover Brother goes undercover as a new employee at a cigarette company owned by The Man, where Mr. Feather discovers his identity. He deploys a secret weapon that he calls &quot;Black Man&#x27;s Kryptonite&quot;, an attractive assassin named White She-Devil. Posing as another new employee, she and Undercover Brother start dating, and she begins to make him do stereotypical &quot;white&quot; things, such as buying corduroy and khaki clothes, singing karaoke, and adopting a silly set of euphemisms. Meanwhile, The Man distributes his mind-control drug through Boutwell&#x27;s fried chicken, infecting other black celebrities and making them act white, as well as marketing the chicken nationwide to land a crushing blow to African-American culture.

Concerned with Undercover Brother&#x27;s unusual behavior, Sistah Girl attacks White She-Devil and convinces Undercover Brother to return to the fight. White She-Devil turns on her own henchmen to save the two, revealing she has fallen in love with Undercover Brother. They return to the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., where Smart Brother questions White She-Devil about The Man and Lance is officially made part of the group when he declares his desire to abolish bigotry after watching &quot;Roots&quot;. The group heads to an awards gala after they find out that James Brown is The Man&#x27;s next target. Mr. Feather kidnaps Brown and takes him to The Man&#x27;s base. B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. secures an antidote for the mind control drug and follows via a transmitter placed on Brown, infiltrating the base posing as a cleaning crew, to rescue Brown and Boutwell.

Mr. Feather prepares to administer the drug to Brown and present him as a trophy to The Man, and Brown reveals himself as Undercover Brother in disguise. Mr. Feather sends his henchmen after B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., who rescue Boutwell, and is ordered by Mr. Feather to kill Undercover Brother. In the fighting, Conspiracy Brother accidentally begins the building&#x27;s self-destruct sequence. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. cures Boutwell and evacuate him from the building while Undercover Brother chases Mr. Feather to the roof. The Man&#x27;s helicopter circles overhead and leaves, The Man abandoning Mr. Feather for failing him. Mr. Feather jumps onto the helicopter&#x27;s landing gear as it flies away, and Undercover Brother uses his afro picks to impale Mr. Feather in the buttocks, causing him to fall into the ocean, where he is eaten by a shark. However, The Man escapes. Undercover Brother survives the building&#x27;s self-destruction by leaping off the building and using his modified parachute pants to escape. He and Sistah Girl kiss and leave the island, the world at peace.

<doc id="1182346" wikidata="Q418892" url="?curid=1182346" title="Glycosphingolipid">
<text>Glycosphingolipids are a subtype of glycolipids containing the amino alcohol sphingosine. They may be considered as sphingolipids with an attached carbohydrate. Glycosphingolipids are a group of lipids (more specifically, sphingolipids) and are a part of the cell membrane. They consist of a hydrophobic ceramide part and a glycosidically bound carbohydrate part. This oligosaccharide content remains on the outside of the cell membrane where it is important for biological processes such as cell adhesion or cell–cell interactions. Glycosphingolipids also play an important role in oncogenesis and ontogenesis.

==Classification==
In general, glycosphingolipids can be categorized into two groups: neutral glycosphingolipids (also called glycosphingolipids) and negatively charged glycosphingolipids. The latter can be distinguished again by means of the charge carrier. While in gangliosides sialic acids are found, sulfatides have a sulfate group. The structural similarity of most glycolipids is the so-called lactosylceramide, that is, a lactose disaccharide that is glycosidically bound to a ceramide. Larger structures are subdivided into different groups by the sequence and configuration of the sugars, the four most common being globo-, lacto-, neoLacto- and gangliose.

Glycosphingolipids include:

* Cerebrosides
* Gangliosides
* Globosides
* Isoglobotriosylceramide

== Occurrence and function ==
Gangliosides are mainly found in the cell membranes of the central nervous system, where their carbohydrate group is responsible for the interaction between individual cells and for signaling. However, gangliosides are also found in other cells. Sialic acids are, for example, part of the so-called sialyl-Lewis-x structure, a tetrasaccharide, which is important for various signal transduction processes. Neutral glycosphingolipids are also important, for example as blood type antigens.

Inheritable enzyme defects can lead to disruption in degradation and therefore to accumulation of glycolipids in various organs. In the case of cerebrirosis, this affects the cerebrosides (examples are Gaucher&#x27;s disease and Krabbe&#x27;s disease); in the case of gangliosides, it affects the gangliosidoses (e.g. Tay–Sachs disease).

<text>Provable security refers to any type or level of computer security that can be proved. It is used in different ways by different fields.

Usually, this refers to mathematical proofs, which are common in cryptography. In such a proof, the capabilities of the attacker are defined by an adversarial model (also referred to as attacker model): the aim of the proof is to show that the attacker must solve the underlying hard problem in order to break the security of the modelled system. Such a proof generally does not consider side-channel attacks or other implementation-specific attacks, because they are usually impossible to model without implementing the system (and thus, the proof only applies to this implementation).

Outside of cryptography, the term is often used in conjunction with secure coding and security by design, both of which can rely on proofs to show the security of a particular approach. As with the cryptographic setting, this involves an attacker model and a model of the system. For example, code can be verified to match the intended functionality, described by a model: this can be done through static checking. These techniques are sometimes used for evaluating products (see &quot;Common Criteria&quot;): the security here depends not only on the correctness of the attacker model, but also on the model of the code.

Finally, the term provable security is sometimes used by sellers of security software that are attempting to sell security products like firewalls, antivirus software and intrusion detection systems. As these products are typically not subject to scrutiny, many security researchers consider this type of claim to be selling snake oil.

== In cryptography ==
In cryptography, a system has provable security if its security requirements can be stated formally in an adversarial model, as opposed to heuristically, with clear assumptions that the adversary has access to the system as well as enough computational resources. The proof of security (called a &quot;reduction&quot;) is that these security requirements are met provided the assumptions about the adversary&#x27;s access to the system are satisfied and some clearly stated assumptions about the hardness of certain computational tasks hold. An early example of such requirements and proof was given by Goldwasser and Micali for semantic security and the construction based on the quadratic residuosity problem. Some proofs of security are in given theoretical models such as the random oracle model, where real cryptographic hash functions are represented by an idealization.

There are several lines of research in provable security. One is to establish the &quot;correct&quot; definition of security for a given, intuitively understood task. Another is to suggest constructions and proofs based on general assumptions as much as possible, for instance the existence of a one-way function. A major open problem is to establish such proofs based on P ≠ NP, since the existence of one-way functions is not known to follow from the conjecture.

=== Controversies ===

Several researchers have found mathematical fallacies in proofs that had been used to make claims about the security of important protocols. In the following partial list of such researchers, their names are followed by first a reference to the original paper with the purported proof and then a reference to the paper in which the researchers reported on flaws:
V. Shoup;
A. J. Menezes;
A. Jha and M. Nandi;
D. Galindo;
T. Iwata, K. Ohashi, and K. Minematsu;
M. Nandi;
J.-S. Coron and D. Naccache;
D. Chakraborty, V. Hernández-Jiménez, and P. Sarkar;
P. Gaži and U. Maurer;
S. A. Kakvi and E. Kiltz;
and T. Holenstein, R. Künzler, and S. Tessaro.

Koblitz and Menezes have written that provable security results for important cryptographic protocols frequently have fallacies in the proofs; are often interpreted in a misleading manner, giving false assurances; typically rely upon strong assumptions that may turn out to be false; are based on unrealistic models of security; and serve to distract researchers&#x27; attention from the need for &quot;old-fashioned&quot; (non-mathematical) testing and analysis. Their series of papers supporting these claims have been controversial in the community. Among the researchers who have rejected the viewpoint of Koblitz–Menezes is Oded Goldreich, a leading theoretician and author of &quot;Foundations of Cryptography&quot;. He wrote a refutation of their first paper &quot;Another look at &#x27;provable security&#x27;&quot; that he titled &quot;On post-modern cryptography&quot;. Goldreich wrote: &quot;... we point out some of the fundamental philosophical flaws that underlie the said article and some of its misconceptions regarding theoretical research in cryptography in the last quarter of a century.&quot; In his essay Goldreich argued that the rigorous analysis methodology of provable security is the only one compatible with science, and that Koblitz and Menezes are &quot;reactionary (i.e., they play to the hands of the opponents of progress)&quot;.

In 2007, Koblitz published &quot;The Uneasy Relationship Between Mathematics and Cryptography&quot;, which contained some controversial statements about provable security and other topics. Researchers Oded Goldreich, Boaz Barak, Jonathan Katz, Hugo Krawczyk, and Avi Wigderson wrote letters responding to Koblitz&#x27;s article, which were published in the November 2007 and January 2008 issues of the journal. Katz, who is coauthor of a highly regarded cryptography textbook, called Koblitz&#x27;s article &quot;snobbery at its purest&quot;; and Wigderson, who is a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, accused Koblitz of &quot;slander&quot;.

Ivan Damgård later wrote a position paper at ICALP 2007 on the technical issues, and it was recommended by Scott Aaronson as a good in-depth analysis.
Brian Snow, former Technical Director of the Information Assurance Directorate of the U.S. National Security Agency, recommended the Koblitz-Menezes paper &quot;The brave new world of bodacious assumptions in cryptography&quot; to the audience at the RSA Conference 2010 Cryptographers Panel.

=== Practice-oriented provable security ===

Classical provable security primarily aimed at studying the relationship between asymptotically defined objects. Instead, practice-oriented provable security is concerned with concrete objects of cryptographic practice, such as hash functions, block ciphers, and protocols as they are deployed and used. Practice oriented provable security uses concrete security to analyse practical constructions with fixed key sizes. &quot;Exact security&quot; or &quot;concrete security&quot; is the name given to provable security reductions where one quantifies security by computing precise bounds on computational effort, rather than an asymptotic bound which is guaranteed to hold for &quot;sufficiently large&quot; values of the security parameter.

<text>Veronica Geng (January 10, 1941 – December 24, 1997) was an American humorist, critic, and magazine editor.

==Life==
Geng was born in Atlanta, Georgia, raised in Philadelphia and attended the University of Pennsylvania. She died in New York City of brain cancer, aged 56.

==Literary career==
Geng was an influential and acclaimed humorist who typically wrote short stories and essays. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her &quot;a brilliant contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the quirky dark lady of Manhattan&#x27;s literary scene, celebrated for her deadpan essays and revolving-door sex life.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Geng &quot;carried on in the tradition of S.J. Perelman.&quot;

Starting in the early 1970s, Geng reviewed books for &quot;The New York Times&quot; for many years; during this time, she also wrote for the &quot;Village Voice.&quot; Her parody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s film critic Pauline Kael, published in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 1975, caught the eye of Roger Angell, a &quot;New Yorker&quot; fiction editor. (He later called Geng &quot;the hardest person he ever had to edit.&quot;) Geng began writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1976 and became an assistant fiction editor.

Geng&#x27;s work typically included elements of satire and parody, with allusions to both high culture and popular culture. Critics praised her humor pieces for their unusual coupling of subjects and control of style, e.g., the Watergate Tapes reviewed by a hip &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic, or a sitcom about the young Henry James. &quot;Her thing was high, intellectual comedy,&quot; noted Charles McGrath, another &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor. The writer Kurt Andersen said Geng&#x27;s pieces &quot;felt as if they were created in a laboratory or an institute for advanced studies.” The author Ben Yagoda, in &quot;About Town: The New Yorker and the World it Made,&quot; described her later writings as &quot;subtle to the point of unintelligibility.&quot;

As a &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor, Geng worked closely with such writers as Philip Roth, Frederick Barthelme, Milan Kundera, William Trevor, James McCourt, and Ian Frazier. She developed a particularly close relationship with Roth, and was considered the unofficial editor of his novels. &quot;I always gave Veronica my books,&quot; Roth said. He credited Geng with persuading William Shawn, the editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, to publish his 1979 novella, &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;, in two issues of the magazine. She remained at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; until 1992, leaving because of disagreements with the magazine&#x27;s editor at the time, Tina Brown.

Geng was also a film reviewer in the 1970s and 1980s for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as well as &quot;Film Comment&quot;, &quot;American Film&quot;, &quot;Soho News&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. She wrote approving essays about Monty Python in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

Geng touched upon feminist issues in pieces such as &quot;Women in Science Fiction,&quot; for &quot;Bookletter&quot;, &quot;Requiem for the Women&#x27;s Movement,&quot; for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Comment&quot; on the Equal Rights Amendment&quot; for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Family==
In 2007, her brother, Steve Geng, published a memoir titled &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot;, which chronicled his relationship with his sister as well as his experiences of growing up as an army brat, drug addiction, time in jail, military experience, HIV and osteonecrosis.

<doc id="1182356" wikidata="Q7304624" url="?curid=1182356" title="Red Mountain (Birmingham)">
<text>Red Mountain is a long ridge running southwest-northeast and dividing Jones Valley from Shades Valley south of Birmingham, Alabama. It is part of the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains. The Red Mountain Formation of hard Silurian rock strata lies exposed in several long crests, and was named &quot;Red Mountain&quot; because of the rust-stained rock faces and prominent seams of red hematite iron ore. The mountain was the site of several mines that supplied iron ore to Birmingham&#x27;s iron furnaces. Most of Birmingham&#x27;s television and radio stations have transmission towers located on Red Mountain.

Red Mountain is also home to Red Mountain Park, one of the largest urban parks in the United States at .

==History==
The proximity of Red Mountain&#x27;s ore to nearby sources of coal and limestone was the impetus to develop and promote the Birmingham District as an industrial site. The mining of iron ore along Red Mountain began in the early 1860s as the Civil War created a demand for iron necessary to sustain the Confederate war efforts. The Union army destroyed the Oxmoor, Irondale and Tannehill furnaces in 1865 and at this point mining stopped along Red Mountain. After the Civil War the production of iron was again being renewed but this time on a commercial level. Under the leadership of such men as Debardeleben, Sloss, and Woodward the mining of iron ore along Red Mountain began again. The mountain developed a symbolic place as the source of wealth in the region and was even portrayed as a character in pageants sponsored by the steel companies in their company towns. In the Altamont and Redmont areas the abandoned mine sites served as the locations for large estates and upper-class developments which offered cool breezes and a panoramic view of the growing industrial city from above the constant layer of thick black smoke. Alex Harvey &quot;Rick&quot; Woodward&#x27;s home is in this area along Altamont Road. His home is now owned and maintained by the University of Alabama at Birmingham and used as the residence of the University president.

As the steel furnaces modernized, labor cost rose, and geological faults in the local ore mines made the ore harder to reach, it became more economical to purchase pelletized ore from distant sources than to continue mining ore from Red Mountain. The last ore mine on Red Mountain closed in 1962 and was operated by US Steel. The last ore mine in the Birmingham district closed in 1972. It was the Pyne Mine off Highway 150 near Bessemer and was operated by the Woodward Iron Company.

In 1938, the giant cast-iron statue of the Roman god of the forge, Vulcan, which represented Birmingham in the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair was put on display atop a sandstone tower built by the Works Progress Administration. This is the world&#x27;s largest cast-iron statue.

Red Mountain serves as a natural promontory for Birmingham&#x27;s radio and television broadcast stations, and a setting for noteworthy private restaurant &quot;The Club.&quot;

===Red Mountain Expressway Cut===
In 1970, the &quot;Red Mountain Expressway&quot; was completed after many years of work cutting through Red Mountain. This highway linked Birmingham with its southern suburbs and spurred suburban growth towards the south of Birmingham. The resultant cut exposed geological strata spanning millions of years, including the red ore seam that spurred Birmingham&#x27;s development. A new species of Lower Silurian (middle Llandovery) phacopsid trilobite, &quot;Acaste birminghamensis&quot;, was first collected from exposures on Red Mountain

==Neighborhood==
There are many neighborhoods that are located along the 33 miles of Red Mountain, that stretches from Sparks Gap on the southwest to Trussville in the northeast. Some of these are Raimund, Muscoda, Lipscomb, Wenonah, Ishkooda, Greensprings, Irondale, Ruffner, and Trussville. Located just southeast of downtown Birmingham, on Red Mountain, is Redmont Park, which was developed in the 1920s by Robert Jemison. It was the home to Birmingham&#x27;s early bankers and iron and steel industrialists. It became one of Birmingham&#x27;s most prominent neighborhoods, home to the majority of the multimillion-dollar residences and estates that are located within the city proper. The prestigious Altamont School, a private school well known for its arts and science programs, is located in the neighborhood, as well as Saint Rose Academy, a Catholic parochial school run by Dominican sisters.

==Red Mountain Museum==
A science museum, the Red Mountain Museum, was opened on the slope adjacent to the cut in 1971. Interpretive signage was installed along one of the terraces of the cut and guardrails and fencing installed to allow museum visitors to inspect the exposed rock close-up. From the late 1970s until 1994, the Red Mountain Museum was quite active in paleontological research, collecting fossil vertebrates and invertebrates from hundreds of localities throughout the state. The staff collected and cataloged tens of thousands of fossils, including many Cretaceous mosasaurs, Pleistocene ground sloths, and primitive Eocene archaeocete whales. Paleontologists, zoologists, geologists and archeologists once employed at the Red Mountain Museum, either as paid staff or as volunteers, include its first curator Whitman Cross, Gorden L. Bell, Jr., James P. Lamb, Winston C. Lancaster, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Susan Henson, and Amy Sheldon.

The Red Mountain Museum later formed a partnership with a nearby children&#x27;s science museum, The Discovery Place, to form &quot;Discovery 2000&quot;, which then moved away from Red Mountain to downtown Birmingham and became the McWane Science Center which opened on July 11, 1998. In 1987 the Red Mountain Expressway Cut was granted National Natural Landmark status by the National Park Service. Deemed unsafe because of the potential for rock slides, the interpretive trail has since been closed to the public. The extensive Red Mountain Museum collection is now stored at the McWane Science Center and once again available to scientists. As of October 2007, the former Red Mountain Museum building had been demolished, but plans for the site are unknown.

==Literary allusions==
The fantasy writer and paleontologist Caitlín R. Kiernan has used Red Mountain, particularly the area west of U.S. Route 31 and the Red Mountain cut, as the setting for four of her novels – &quot;Silk&quot; (1998), &quot;Threshold&quot; (2001), &quot;Low Red Moon&quot; (2003), and, to a much lesser extent, &quot;Murder of Angels&quot; (2004). The geography and geology of the mountain was integral to the plot of &quot;Threshold&quot;, and in a chapbook on the novel (&quot;Trilobite: The Writing of Threshold&quot;; Subterranean Press, 2003), Kiernan includes an afterword describing the geological history and paleontology of the Paleozoic strata of Red Mountain.

Fannie Flagg&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;I Still Dream About You&quot; features Red Mountain prominently.

<doc id="1182359" wikidata="Q1513059" url="?curid=1182359" title="Clock synchronization">
<text>Clock synchronization is a topic in computer science and engineering that aims to coordinate otherwise independent clocks. Even when initially set accurately, real clocks will differ after some amount of time due to clock drift, caused by clocks counting time at slightly different rates. There are several problems that occur as a result of clock rate differences and several solutions, some being more acceptable than others in certain contexts.

==Terminology==
In serial communication, clock synchronization can refer to clock recovery which achieves frequency synchronization, as opposed to full phase synchronization. Such clock synchronization is used in synchronization in telecommunications and automatic baud rate detection.

Plesiochronous or isochronous operation refers to a system with frequency synchronization and loose constraints on phase synchronization. Synchronous operation implies a tighter synchronization based on time perhaps in addition to frequency.

==Problems==
As a result of the difficulties managing time at smaller scales, there are problems associated with clock skew that take on more complexity in distributed computing in which several computers will need to realize the same global time. For instance, in Unix systems the &quot;make&quot; command is used to compile new or modified code and seeks to avoid recompiling unchanged code. The &quot;make&quot; command uses the clock of the machine it runs on to determine which source files need to be recompiled. If the sources reside on a separate file server and the two machines have unsynchronized clocks, the &quot;make&quot; program might not produce the correct results.

Synchronization is required for accurate reproduction of streaming media. Clock synchronization is a significant component of audio over Ethernet systems.

==Solutions==
In a system with a central server, the synchronization solution is trivial; the server will dictate the system time. Cristian&#x27;s algorithm and the Berkeley algorithm are potential solutions to the clock synchronization problem in this environment.

In distributed computing, the problem takes on more complexity because a global time is not easily known. The most used clock synchronization solution on the Internet is the Network Time Protocol (NTP) which is a layered client-server architecture based on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) message passing. Lamport timestamps and vector clocks are concepts of the logical clock in distributed computing.

In a wireless network, the problem becomes even more challenging due to the possibility of collision of the synchronization packets on the wireless medium and the higher drift rate of clocks on low-cost wireless devices.

===Berkeley algorithm===

The Berkeley algorithm is suitable for systems where a radio clock is not present. This system has no way of making sure of the actual time other than by maintaining a global average time as the global time. A time server will periodically fetch the time from all the time clients, average the results, and then report back to the clients the adjustment that needs be made to their local clocks to achieve the average. This algorithm highlights the fact that internal clocks may vary not only in the time they contain but also in the clock rate.

===Clock-sampling mutual network synchronization===
Clock-sampling mutual network synchronization (CS-MNS) is suitable for distributed and mobile applications. It has been shown to be scalable over mesh networks that include indirectly-linked non-adjacent nodes, and is compatible with IEEE 802.11 and similar standards. It can be accurate to the order of few microseconds, but requires direct physical wireless connectivity with negligible link delay (less than 1 microsecond) on links between adjacent nodes, limiting the distance between neighboring nodes to a few hundred meters.

===Cristian&#x27;s algorithm===

Cristian&#x27;s algorithm relies on the existence of a time server. The time server maintains its clock by using a radio clock or other accurate time source, then all other computers in the system stay synchronized with it. A time client will maintain its clock by making a procedure call to the time server. Variations of this algorithm make more precise time calculations by factoring in network radio propagation time.

===Satellite navigation systems===
In addition to its use in navigation, the Global Positioning System (GPS) can also be used for clock synchronization. The accuracy of GPS time signals is ±10 nanoseconds. Using GPS (or other satellite navigation systems) for synchronization requires a receiver connected to an antenna with unobstructed view of the sky.

===Inter-range Instrumentation Group time codes===
IRIG timecodes are standard formats for transferring timing information. Atomic frequency standards and GPS receivers designed for precision timing are often equipped with an IRIG output. The standards were created by the Telecommunications Working Group of the United States military&#x27;s Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG), the standards body of the Range Commanders Council. Work on these standards started in October 1956, and the original standards were accepted in 1960.

===Network Time Protocol===
Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a highly robust protocol, widely deployed throughout the Internet. Well tested over the years, it is generally regarded as the state of the art in distributed time synchronization protocols for unreliable networks. It can reduce synchronization offsets to times of the order of a few milliseconds over the public Internet, and to sub-millisecond levels over local area networks.

A simplified version of the NTP protocol, Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP), can also be used as a pure single-shot stateless primary/secondary synchronization protocol, but lacks the sophisticated features of NTP, and thus has much lower performance and reliability levels.

===Precision Time Protocol===
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a master/slave protocol for delivery of highly accurate time over local area networks.

===Reference broadcast synchronization===
The Reference Broadcast Time Synchronization (RBS) algorithm is often used in wireless networks and sensor networks. In this scheme, an initiator broadcasts a reference message to urge the receivers to adjust their clocks.

===Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization===
The Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization (RBIS) protocol is a master/slave synchronization protocol, like RBS, based on a receiver/receiver synchronization paradigm. It is specifically tailored to be used in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks configured in infrastructure mode (i.e., coordinated by an access point). The protocol does not require any modification to the access point.

===Synchronous Ethernet===
Synchronous Ethernet uses Ethernet in a synchronous manner such that when combined with synchronization protocols such as PTP in the case of the White Rabbit Project, sub-nanosecond synchronization accuracy is achieved.

===Wireless ad hoc networks===
Synchronization is achieved in wireless ad hoc networks through sending synchronization messages in a multi-hop manner and each node progressively synchronizing with the node that is the immediate sender of a synchronization message. Examples include Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), and Harmonia, both able to achieve synchronization with accuracy on the order of microseconds.

===Huygens===
Researchers from Stanford and Google introduced Huygens, a probe-based, end-to-end clock synchronization algorithm. Huygens is implemented in software and thus can be deployed in data centers or in public cloud environments. By leveraging some key aspects of modern data centers, and applying novel estimation algorithms and signal processing techniques, the Huygens algorithm achieved an accuracy of tens of nanoseconds even at high network load. The findings of this research are being tested in financial market applications.

<doc id="1182360" wikidata="Q520424" url="?curid=1182360" title="Nick Collison">
<text>Nicholas John Collison (born October 26, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player who is a special assistant for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He spent his entire career with the organization originally known as the Seattle SuperSonics, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008. Collison was drafted by the SuperSonics in the first round of the 2003 NBA draft and retired as a member of the Thunder in 2018. As a college player, he went to two Final Fours as a member of the Kansas Jayhawks.

==Early life==
Collison was born in Orange City, Iowa and grew up in Fort Dodge and Iowa Falls. He attended Iowa Falls High School and was a McDonald&#x27;s All-American in 1999.

==College career==
Teaming with fellow Iowan Kirk Hinrich to form one of the best duos in college basketball, Collison helped the University of Kansas reach two consecutive Final Fours (2002 and 2003). Collison finished his college career as the leading scorer in the history of the Big 12 Conference (a mark since surpassed). In 2003, the Jayhawks lost to Carmelo Anthony and the Syracuse Orange in the National Championship game, 81–78. Collison also played for the United States national team at the 2002 FIBA World Championship.

Collison&#x27;s No. 4 jersey was retired by the Jayhawks on November 25, 2003, during halftime of the Kansas-Michigan State game in recognition of his achievements over his four-year career (2002–03 Player of the Year, consensus first-team All-America, Big 12 Player of the Year).

==Professional career==

===Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2003–2018)===

==== Draft year injury and relocation (2003–2008) ====

Collison was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 12th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft but missed the 2003–04 season with injuries to both shoulders. He made his NBA debut on November 3, 2004, recording two points, five rebounds and two assists in a 114–84 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Collison appeared in all 82 games in the 2004–05 season, averaging 5.6 points and 4.6 rebounds in 17.0 minutes per game. He played in all 82 games for a second time during the 2006–07 season. On January 9, 2007, Collison had a career-best game with 29 points and 21 rebounds in a 113–102 loss to the Phoenix Suns. In 2008, the franchise relocated to Oklahoma City and rebranded as the Thunder.

==== Finals appearance and later years (2008–2018) ====
On December 19, 2010, Collison scored a season-high 19 points and added eight rebounds in a 113–120 loss to the Phoenix Suns. In the game, he also drew his 15th charge of the season, a majority of the 22 charges the Thunder had drawn as a team to that point in the season. That postseason, on May 15, 2011, Collison helped the Thunder to a Western Conference Semifinals Game 7 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, with eight points and a playoff career-high 12 rebounds. The next round, Collison and the Thunder lost to the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Finals.

In 2012, Collison helped the Thunder make the leap to the next level, and reach the NBA Finals, where they lost in five games to the Miami Heat, who were led by Collison&#x27;s fellow 2003 draftees LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh.

On February 3, 2015, Collison signed a two-year, $7.5 million contract extension with the Thunder.

On July 21, 2017, Collison re-signed with the Thunder to a one-year, minimum salary deal.

Collison&#x27;s final NBA game was played on April 11, 2018, a 137–123 win over the Memphis Grizzlies where he recorded one point and one rebound.

===Retirement===
On May 10, 2018, Collison announced his retirement from professional basketball. On January 12, 2019, the Thunder announced that they would be retiring Collison&#x27;s No. 4 jersey, becoming the first number retired by the Thunder.

==Post-playing career==
Following his retirement as a player, Collison joined the Thunder in the position of basketball operations representative. On August 10, 2021, he was promoted to the position of special assistant to executive Vice President and general manager.

==Personal life==
After the Sonics relocated to Oklahoma City, Collison continued to make his home in Seattle.

Collison appeared on the cover of the 989 Sports video game NCAA Final Four 2004. The game was released on November 11, 2003, for the PlayStation 2.

Collison has a daughter named Emma. His younger brother, Michael, played college basketball for their father&#x27;s alma mater, Briar Cliff University, in Sioux City, Iowa.

<doc id="1182368" wikidata="Q4664202" url="?curid=1182368" title="Abbot Ice Shelf">
<text>The Abbot Ice Shelf () is an ice shelf long and wide, bordering Eights Coast from Cape Waite to Pfrogner Point in Antarctica. 
Thurston Island lies along the northern edge of the western half of this ice shelf; other sizable islands (Sherman Island, Carpenter Island, Dustin Island, Johnson Island, McNamara Island, Farwell Island and Dendtler Island) lie partly or wholly within this shelf.
==Location==
The Abbott Ice Shelf extends to the south of Thurston Island, Dustin Island, McNamara Island, and Farwell Island all of which lie between the ice shelf and the Bellingshausen Sea.
It occupies the whole of Peacock Sound in its western part.
The Demas Ice Tongue extends into the Amundsen Sea from the west end of the ice shelf.
Islands embedded in the bbott Ice Shelf include the Trice Islands, Sherman Island, Carpenter Island, Johnson Island, Lepley Nunatak and Dendtler Island.
It is to the north of King Peninsula and Jones Mountains on the Eights Coast,
Cape Waite on King Peninsula lies at its western end, and Pfrogner Point on Fletcher Peninsula is at its eastern end.
Fletcher Peninsula separates it from the Venable Ice Shelf to the east.

==Discovery and name==
The Abbot Ice Shelf shelf was sighted by members of the United States Antarctic Service in flights from the ship &quot;Bear&quot;, in February 1940.
Its western portion was delineated from air photos taken by the United States Navy (USN) Operation Highjump, 1946–47. 
The full extent was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from USN air photos of 1966.
It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Rear Admiral James Lloyd Abbot Jr., Commanding Officer, U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica, February 1967 to June 1969.

==Features==
===Peacock Sound===
An ice-filled sound, long and wide, separating Thurston Island from the Eights Coast. 
The sound is not navigable by ships, it being occupied by the western part of Abbot Ice Shelf. 
The feature was discovered by members of the USAS in flights from the ship &quot;Bear&quot; in February 1940, and was further delineated from air photos taken by United States Navy Operation Highjump in December 1946. 
The sound was first noted to parallel the entire south coast of Thurston Island, thereby establishing insularity, by the United States Navy Bellingshausen Sea Expedition in February 1960. 
Named after the sloop of war &quot;Peacock&quot; in which Captain William L. Hudson, in company with the tender &quot;Flying Fish&quot; under Lieutenant William M. Walker, both of the USEE, 1838-42, sailed along the edge of the pack ice to the north of Thurston Island for several days in March 1839.

===Farwell Island===
An ice-covered island, about long and wide, lying between McNamara and Dendtler Islands in the east part of Abbot Ice Shelf. 
The feature was positioned by parties from the USS Glacier and Stolen Island in February 1961, and was mapped by USGS from United States Navy air photos of 1966. 
Named by US-ACAN for Captain A.F. Farwell, Chief of Staff to the Commander, United States Naval Support Force, Antarctica, during Deep Freeze 1968 and 1969.

===Sherman Island===
An ice-covered island about long and wide, lying south of Thurston Island in the middle of Peacock Sound. 
The feature rises above Abbot Ice Shelf which occupies the sound. 
Delineated from aerial photographs taken by United States Navy OpHjp in December 1946.
Named by US-ACAN for Admiral Forrest Sherman, United States Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, 1949-51, when preparations were being made for United States Naval support during the forthcoming IGY operations.

===Trice Islands===
A group of small ice-covered islands lying just west of Evans Point. 
The group rises above the general level of Abbot Ice Shelf which occupies the sound. 
First mapped from air photos taken by United States Navy OpHjp, .1946-47. 
Named by US-ACAN for Jack L. Trice, meteorologist at Byrd Station, 1964-65.

===Carpenter Island===
An oval-shaped island, long, within the Abbot Ice Shelf of Peacock Sound. 
It lies due east of Sherman Island. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-66. 
Named by US-ACAN for Donald L. Carpenter, radio scientist at Byrd Station, 1966-67.

===Johnson Island===
An ice-covered island, about long and wide, lying within Abbot Ice Shelf, about southeast of Dustin Island. 
The feature was observed and roughly positioned as an &quot;ice rise&quot; by parties from the USS Glacier in February 1961. 
Remapped by USGS from United States Navy air photos, 1966. 
Named by US-ACAN for Theodore L. Johnson, electrical engineer at Byrd Station, 1964-65.

===Lepley Nunatak===
A small conspicuous rocky nunatak southwest of Dentler Island, lying near the inner part and east end of Abbot Ice Shelf. 
First sighted on February 9, 1961 from helicopters of the USS &quot;Glacier&quot; and &quot;Staten Island&quot;. 
Named by US-ACAN for Larry K. Lepley, oceanographer of the United States Navy Hydrographic Office, who with three others was marooned at this nunatak, February 12-15, 1961, by a severe wind and snowstorm.

===Dendtler Island===
An ice-covered island, long, lying in the east part of Abbot Ice Shelf between Farwell Island and Fletcher Peninsula. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-66. 
Named by US-ACAN for Major Robert Dendtler, United States Army, coordinating officer on the staff of the Commander, United States Navy Support Force, Antarctica, during Deep Freeze 1967 and 1968.

<text>Arthur Kallet (December 15, 1902February 24, 1972) was an American consumer advocate.

== Career ==
An engineer, Kallet co-authored a 1933 book entitled &quot;100,000,000 Guinea Pigs: Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics&quot; with fellow engineer Frederick Schlink.

In 1936 he left as director of Consumers&#x27; Research after its head, F.J. Schlink, fired three striking employees who had tried to form a union, and joined with Amherst College professor Colston Warne to found Consumers Union and Consumer Reports.

The House Un-American Activities Committee cited Arthur Kallet as the communist head of Consumers Union, which it cited as a communist front.

In 1957, Kallet broke with Warne and left Consumers Union to form The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, and in 1961, Buyers Laboratory Inc.

<text>Anat Blumenfeld is an Israeli research biochemist at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.

Blumenfeld discovered a chromosome responsible for the serious disease Familial dysautonomia which affects the nerves of fetuses. About 100 families in Israel of Ashkenazi Jewish origin have one or more children with the disease, and they suffer from nausea, high blood pressure, and some food entering their lungs. Dr. Blumenfeld says the disease was discovered about 40 years ago, but researchers did not know what caused it and whether it was genetic. She collected blood specimens for three years from the affected families and checked all their chromosomes and identified No. 9 as causing the disease. Apart from the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where Blumenfeld works, the test is now used only in New York.

<text>NKVD Order № 00439, signed by Nikolai Yezhov on July 25, 1937, was the basis for the German operation of the NKVD in 1937–1938. The operation was the first in the series of national operations of the NKVD.

The order commanded to arrest citizens of Germany, as well as former German citizens who assumed the Soviet citizenship. German citizens who worked at railways and defense enterprises were qualified as &quot;penetrated agents of the German General Staff and Gestapo&quot;, ready for diversion activity &quot;during the war period&quot; (N.B.: the war was considered imminent).

During the first month of the operation, 472 persons were arrested; the total number was around 800 persons, or about 20% of the whole number of registered German citizens at the time.

The order also instructed to be prepared for the second wave of repressions against Soviet citizens of German ethnicity. Indeed, the national operation against Soviet citizens of German descent resulted in the sentencing of at least 55,005 persons, including 41,898 sentenced to death.

<text>Felix Solomon Cohen (July 3, 1907 – October 19, 1953) was an American lawyer and scholar who made a lasting mark on legal philosophy and fundamentally shaped federal Indian law and policy.

== Biography ==
Felix S. Cohen was born in Manhattan, New York in 1907 and grew up in Yonkers. Cohen attended the City College of New York, and received an M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 1927 and 1929, respectively. Cohen entered Columbia Law School in 1928 and graduated in 1931. He was the legislation and book review editor of the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;, serving under Editor-in-Chief Herbert Wechsler.

Cohen became a leading figure in Legal Realism, a legal movement that challenged the Formalist idea that legal principles could be discerned in the abstract, separate from their enforcement, judicial interpretation, or impact on society. Cohen&#x27;s most famous contribution to this debate was &quot;Transcendental Nonsense and the Functional Approach&quot;, which ran in the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; in 1935 and remains among the most-cited law review articles ever written.

Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal administration brought Cohen from academic study to public service. Cohen worked in the Solicitor&#x27;s Office of the Department of the Interior from 1933 to 1947. In this position, Cohen was the primary legal architect of the Indian New Deal, a federal policy that sought to strengthen tribal governments and reduce federal domination of Indian tribes. Cohen was the drafter of the centerpiece legislation of this era, the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. In his research on Indian law, he was assisted by his wife Lucy Kramer Cohen (1907-2007). She had studied mathematics and anthropology at Barnard College in the 1920s and earned her master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Columbia University. With background in anthropology, economics, and statistics, she had worked for anthropology professor Franz Boas.

In 1939 Felix Cohen became Chief of the Indian Law Survey, an effort to compile the federal laws and treaties regarding American Indians. The resulting book, published in 1941 as &quot;The Handbook of Federal Indian Law&quot;, became much more than a simple survey. The Handbook was the first to show how hundreds of years of diverse treaties, statutes, and decisions formed a comprehensive whole. Today, Cohen is credited with creating the modern field of Federal Indian Law. Although the treatise began as a joint project between the Department of Interior and the Department of Justice, Justice fired Cohen from the project and terminated the survey. The motivations of Justice are not entirely clear. Cohen seemed to believe that antisemitism was at play, but there were also substantial ideological differences between Cohen and his supervisors at Justice. Justice may have been concerned that the book would be too powerful a tool for Indian tribes. Ultimately, the book was published, but under the auspices of Interior alone. For this work, Cohen received the department&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award in 1948. The University of New Mexico reissued the initial Handbook in 1971, and updated versions of the Handbook were published in 1982 and 2005.

Cohen left government service in 1947 after federal policy shifted from one of support for tribal governments to that of terminating tribal sovereign status. He then entered private legal practice and taught legal philosophy at Yale Law School, The City College of New York, and Rutgers Law School. In 1951 Cohen published &quot;Readings in Jurisprudence and Legal Philosophy&quot; with his father, Professor Morris R. Cohen. While in private practice, Cohen litigated Indian land claims, won the right to vote for American Indians in New Mexico and Arizona, and successfully challenged Arizona&#x27;s practice of denying social security benefits to Indians. He also continued to write and advocate regarding Federal Indian Law, publishing The Erosion of Indian Rights 1950-1953: A Case Study in Bureaucracy, 62 Yale L. J. 348 (1952–53), shortly before his untimely death in 1953. Cohen had also become increasingly committed to fighting other forms of oppression, in particular to securing the rights of immigrants and ethnic minorities. His major articles are anthologized in &quot;The Legal Conscience: Selected Papers of Felix S. Cohen&quot;, which was edited and assembled by his widow Lucy Kramer Cohen in 1960.

<text>College of DuPage is a public community college with its main campus in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. The college also owns and operates satellite campuses in Addison, Carol Stream, Naperville and Westmont. With more than 20,000 students, the College of DuPage, the college serves students residing in Illinois&#x27; Community College District 502.

==History==
College of DuPage was established after the Illinois General Assembly adopted the Public Community College Act of 1965 and the approval of DuPage high school district voters in a referendum. The college opened on September 25, 1967, under the leadership of the college&#x27;s president, Rodney K. Berg, and Board of Trustees Chairman George L. Seaton. At the time, classes were held in office trailers and leased suburban sites throughout the newly established Community College District 502. Due to the college&#x27;s students, faculty and staff having to drive from building to building for classes, the chaparral was adopted as the school&#x27;s mascot. That year, &quot;The Courier&quot;, the school&#x27;s student newspaper, published its first issue.

In 1968, the Glen Ellyn campus location was acquired. A year later, three interim buildings were constructed west of Lambert Road in Glen Ellyn. The Berg Instructional Center, the college&#x27;s first permanent building, opened in 1973. WDCB, a public radio station owned by the college, was founded in 1977. Harold D. McAninch was appointed as the college&#x27;s second president in 1979. In 1982, the college began publishing the &quot;Prairie Light Review&quot;, a literary magazine. The Student Resource Center (SRC) and Physical Education and Recreation Center opened in 1983.

The McAninch Arts Center was built in 1986. In 1990, the Seaton Computing Center was built and housed computer-specific classrooms for the Computer Information Systems, Computer and Internet working Technologies, and Office Technology Information programs. A year later, the college opened new campus locations in Naperville and Westmont, Illinois.

Michael T. Murphy became the college&#x27;s third president in 1994. In 2002, voters approved a $183-million bond referendum that provided funds for renovating and rebuilding the Glen Ellyn campus and off-campus locations. Funds from the referendum were used to build the Homeland Security Education Center, the Student Services Center, and the Culinary &amp; Hospitality Center. In 2003, Sunil Chand replaced Murphy as the college&#x27;s president. That year the College expanded with the opening of the Bloomingdale Center for Independent Learning. The Carol Stream Community Education Center opened in 2004 and the West Chicago Community Education Center in 2005. In fall 2005, College of DuPage converted from a quarter system to a semester system.

In 2006, College of DuPage and the Indian Prairie District 204 created the Frontier Campus, a magnet school for District 204 seniors and an additional college regional center. The college&#x27;s Early Childhood Center and new campus roadways and parking lots were completed in 2007. The following year, the college received a maximum seven-year re-accreditation through the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.

In May 2008, the board of trustees abruptly removed the college president, Sunil Chand. Faculty members and students protested a November 2008 board meeting to implement conservative activist David Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Academic Bill of Rights&quot;, which takes control over curriculum away from teachers and gives it to the school board. The faculty association sent a letter to the board noting that the changes were never discussed and no complaints over curriculum have been filed by students.

In January 2009, Robert L. Breuder became the college&#x27;s president. The Health and Science Center and Technical Education Center opened that summer on the Glen Ellyn campus. The Technical Education Center is 178,000 square feet (16,500 m2) and houses the Automotive Technology, HVAC/ELMEC, Architecture, Horticulture, and Interior Design programs, and in a new steel, glass and precast concrete panel building on the west side of campus. The building was awarded LEED Silver certification and was designed to support horticulture, construction trades, architecture, interior design, construction management, and automotive technology.

In May 2016, Dr Ann Rondeau was elected to become the sixth president of the College of DuPage.

The BIC Renovation (phase one completed in 2011; phase two completed in 2012) and the new Student Services Center (SSC) (completed in 2011) included the reorganization of faculty and administrative departments, expanded student commons, updated classrooms and labs. The addition of the new Student Services Center which now connects the SRC and BIC with a large naturally lit commons, a new coffee shop and &#x27;one-stop-shop&#x27; student services offices and operations. The renovation and Student Services Center replaced the deteriorating BIC exterior with a new, modern panel and glass exterior and bright interior spaces. The transfer of the classes to the BIC enabled the construction of the next phase of the Homeland Security Education Center expansion on the west side of campus. The project was designed by the Architecture firm Loebl Schlossman Hackl, with Brandon Lipman AIA as Principal Designer.

The Culinary and Hospitality Center (CHC) was completed in 2011. It houses culinary kitchens and bakeries, a six-room boutique hotel run by students of the hospitality program, two gourmet restaurants open to the public, a culinary amphitheater and the college&#x27;s Multimedia Services department. Waterleaf, one of the college&#x27;s two restaurants, seats 150 people. The project was also designed by the Architecture firm Loebl Schlossman Hackl, with Brandon Lipman AIA as Principal Designer.

Phase one of the Homeland Security Education Center was completed in 2011. The center houses the college&#x27;s Criminal Justice and Fire Science Technology programs, as well as the Suburban Law Enforcement Academy and the COD police department.

The College of DuPage had a special fund for administrators called an &quot;imprest fund.&quot; Any purchase made from the fund that is under the $15,000 is not subject to disclosure to the public or review by the board of trustees. The Board of Trustees reportedly failed to review the itemized receipts for $26 million of expenditures that college administrators have spent over 16 months. In October 2014, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; awarded COD its weekly Golden Hammer Award, given for waste, fraud, and abuse, in response to its management of this fund.

In 2014, COD President Robert Breuder sent an email to the college&#x27;s trustees asking them to come up with a justification that would allow the State of Illinois&#x27; to disburse a $20 million grant that the legislature previously had approved. In the email, Breuder proposed associating the released funds with a planned $50 million teaching and learning center. The appropriation incident and Breuder&#x27;s email led to an editorial in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that called the episode, &quot;a seedy little money grab by officials at the College of DuPage.&quot;

On January 22, 2015, the board of trustees voted to give COD President Robert Breuder $763,000 as a retirement package. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;some trustees now acknowledge that the buyout was negotiated to terminate Breuder&#x27;s contract, which had been secretly extended to 2019.&quot; A spokesman from the office of Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner said the administration had been watching the entire vote process carefully and had notified the Illinois Community College Board, the state authority over community colleges. This retirement package was voted again during the January 28, 2015 meeting after the Edgar County Watchdogs and others won a Temporary Restraining Order directing the board to hold its meetings in a room large enough to accommodate those wishing to attend. This second January meeting saw more than 500 attendees, and at least 60 people spoke during public comment lasting several hours.

In December 2015, the Higher Learning Commission placed COD on accreditation probation, due to concerns about &quot;operating with integrity and governance of the College.&quot; That probation was lifted two years later.

==Academics==
College of DuPage offers transfer degree and technical education programs in various fields and disciplines. The college offers 9 different associate degrees with 79 different associate degree options and 161 Certifications. Academic Opportunities can be found in nine different areas including Adult Fast Track, Dual Credit programs for high school students, Field Studies &amp; Outdoor Adventures, Global Education, Honors programs, Learning Communities, STEM, Study Abroad, and Workforce Development.

The college offers &quot;3+1 degree&quot; programs to earn a bachelor of science or bachelor of arts degree. The program requires students to take three years of classes at College of DuPage and a fourth year taught by a partner university on College of DuPage&#x27;s campus.

<doc id="1182380" wikidata="Q724783" url="?curid=1182380" title="The Tiger Lillies">
<text>The Tiger Lillies are a British musical trio formed in 1989 by singer-songwriter Martyn Jacques. Described as the forefathers of Brechtian Punk Cabaret, the Tiger Lillies are known for their unique sound and style which merges &quot;the macabre magic of pre-war Berlin with the savage edge of punk&quot;.

==History==
The band&#x27;s name is rumoured to have been inspired by a murdered Soho sex worker called Lillie who used to dress up in animal print. Jacques, however, has stated that he named the band after a painting he had on his wall. The band formed in 1989 when Martyn Jacques placed an ad on &quot;Loot&quot; looking for a drummer and a bass player for a new band. Adrian Huge and Phil Butcher (the band&#x27;s first bassist who was succeeded by Adrian Stout in 1995) were the only musicians that got in touch with him and therefore became the original Tiger Lillies&#x27; drummer and bassist respectively.

In Spring 2012 Adrian Huge decided to take a leave of absence and was replaced by drummer Mike Pickering who toured with the Tiger Lillies from 2012. In early 2015 Pickering was replaced by Jonas Golland. By late 2021 the band had recruited their current drummer, Budi Butenop. 

==Musical style==
&quot;The Independent&quot; has described The Tiger Lillies as &quot;a provocative and avant-garde three-piece band that combines cabaret, vaudeville, music-hall and street theatre&quot;, while Tim Arthur of Time Out described them as: &quot;Kurt Weill conjuring up images of prewar Berlin while a falsetto vocalist screams, squeaks and squawks his way through every number like some rambling madman&quot;. The Tiger Lillies&#x27; songs often involve bestiality, prostitution, blasphemy and other vices. Their musical style is mainly influenced by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill&#x27;s masterpiece The Threepenny Opera and pre-war Berlin cabaret but other influences such as gypsy and circus music, French chanson and British music hall tunes are also evident.

==Awards and nominations==
* In 2002 their cult hit musical Shockheaded Peter was nominated for five Olivier Awards. The show won the Olivier for Best Entertainment and Martyn Jacques won the Olivier for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical or Entertainment.
* In 2003 their album &quot;The Gorey End&quot; (in collaboration with the Kronos Quartet and writer, illustrator Edward Gorey) was nominated for Dominique de Rivaz&#x27;s &quot;Luftbusiness&quot; (2008) a Grammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album.
* In 2012 their show &quot;The Tiger Lillies Perform Hamlet&quot;, produced by Copenhagen&#x27;s Republique Theatre and directed by acclaimed Danish director Martin Tulinius, was nominated for a Reumert Award in the category Music Theatre/Show of the Year 2012.

<text>Richard Lamar Dent (born December 13, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL), primarily for the Chicago Bears. He was the MVP of the Super Bowl XX. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bears===
After playing four years at Tennessee State University and graduating in 1983, Dent was selected in the eighth round by the Bears, with the 203rd overall pick in the 1983 NFL draft. At 6 ft 5 in, , Dent was a great pass rusher who beat offensive tackles with his speed and thrived in defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan&#x27;s aggressive 46 defense. He was part of the core of great players who made the Bears&#x27; defenses of the 1980s legendary. Between 1984 and 1985, Dent recorded 34.5 sacks while recording a then team-record 17.5 sacks in the former season.

====1985 season====

When the Bears went on to defeat the New England Patriots in a 46–10 landslide in Super Bowl XX, Dent was selected as the game&#x27;s MVP. During the game, he had 1.5 sacks, forced two fumbles, and blocked a pass. Dent made a mere $90,000 in base salary for his efforts in 1985 ($ in dollars). He was a featured soloist of the &quot;Shuffling Crew&quot; in the video, the &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; in 1985.

===After Chicago===
Dent would remain with the team until the end of the 1993 season, after the Bears had won just one playoff game since their loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the 1988 NFC Championship Game, and head coach Mike Ditka had been replaced by Dave Wannstedt.

Dent won another Super Bowl ring after spending the 1994 season under contract with the 49ers, though he spent almost the whole year injured. Injuries would continue to hamper Dent after his return to Chicago in 1995. He would spend 1996 and 1997 with the Indianapolis Colts and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively, playing the so-called designated pass rusher for them.

Dent retired after the 1997 season. His lifetime statistics included 137.5 sacks and eight interceptions; he returned these picks for 89 yards and one touchdown. He also recovered 13 fumbles, returning them for 56 yards and one touchdown. He had 124.5 sacks during his first stint with the Bears, from 1983 to 1993. At the time of his retirement, his 137.5 sacks ranked him third in NFL history behind Reggie White and Bruce Smith.

===Post-retirement===

During Super Bowl XLIV, Dent joined other members of the 1985 Chicago Bears in resurrecting the &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; in a Boost Mobile commercial.

Dent was nominated numerous times for the Pro Football Hall of Fame and in 2005–2009 he was among the top 15 finalists in the selection process. After several years of unsuccessful nominations, he was finally selected for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio on February 5, 2011. His induction speech was notable for omitting any mention of both Ditka and Ryan. Since his retirement Dent has had a difficult relationship with Ditka because he publicly blamed Ditka for the Bears&#x27; inability to repeat as Super Bowl champions. In a 2012 interview on WSCR, Dent argued that the Bears would have won at least three Super Bowls if they had been able to find any consistency at quarterback.

In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Dent was also inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Personal life==
According to a DNA analysis, he descended mainly from Mende people of Sierra Leone and Balanta people of Guinea Bissau. He is the godfather of football player Ahmaad Smith.

Richard lives in Chicago and has four children: Mary, Sarah, R.J., and Shiloh. His son R.J. is a football player who played WR at Stevenson High School, and now plays at Miami University Ohio.

<text>The Airline History Museum is an aviation museum located at the Kansas City Downtown Airport in Kansas City, Missouri focused on the history of airlines in the United States.

== History ==

Founded in 1986 by aviation enthusiasts Larry A. Brown and Dick McMahon, the Airline History Museum was originally known as Save-A-Connie. Brown and McMahon were joined by a number of other enthusiasts, including (then) current and former TWA employees.

The museum initially considered building a hangar to house the Constellation, but eventually reached an agreement to lease Hangar 9 at Kansas City Downtown Airport from Executive Beechcraft in 2000.

The museum&#x27;s director was convicted of embezzlement in 2010.

In January 2011, as part of its 25th anniversary, the museum announced a goal of meeting the &quot;Characteristics of Excellence&quot; standards established by the American Alliance of Museums. To that end, it began a reorganization plan, which included a complete rebranding effort to include a new membership structure, website, corporate logo, and exhibit structure within the museum building.

In March 2011 the museum announced that in the continuation of its reorganization and restructure, it was being renamed the National Airline History Museum. This name change allowed it to be better positioned to receive Federal grants and other national funding. The museum announced in March, 2011 that it had teamed up with Kansas City&#x27;s Roasterie Coffee Shop, with the Roasterie brand being known as &quot;The Official Coffee of the National Airline History Museum&quot; and carrying an image of the museum&#x27;s DC-3 on its coffee products.

In 2013, the museum announced plans to restore its Lockheed Constellation to flight.

In 2014, the museum acquired a Douglas DC-8 and attempted to have it ferried to the museum. However, the plan to store it on the ramp outside the hangar was rejected by the owner of the property.

In 2016, the museum acquired a Boeing 727 in storage at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington. However, it was scrapped in 2021 after the museum was unable to move it.

The same year, the museum announced plans to partner with the owner of a Northrop Delta to have it restored. By that time its name had reverted to the Airline History Museum.

In 2020, the museum acquired a Ryan PT-22 Recruit that belonged to actor Harrison Ford.

The museum was threatened with eviction in 2019, when the airport required the owner of the hangar, Signature Flight Support, to start paying rent. The museum was served an eviction notice in 2022. The following year the museum was locked out of their hangar. In 2024, it filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration over the issue. The museum sold its Constellation later that year.

== Exhibits ==

The museum maintains five aircraft at the site; two are in flying condition and one is undergoing restoration. An additional corporate mock-up is also on display.

===Martin 4-0-4===

There were only 103 Martin 4-0-4s built. TWA operated 40 in their fleet along the U. S. east coast, while strong competitor Eastern Airlines operated the largest 4-0-4 fleet, flying 60 aircraft along that airline&#x27;s eastern seaboard route, including in and around Florida. The museum&#x27;s Martin 4-0-4 has not flown in years. As part of the National Airline History Museum’s reorganization plan, which began in 2011, a maintenance inspection of the Martin 4-0-4 was completed in August 2011 to determine the feasibility of returning the aircraft to flying status. Rumors of extensive corrosion and insurmountable mechanical problems were found to be untrue, and a maintenance program is being developed to return the aircraft to flying condition.

===Douglas DC-3===

The museum&#x27;s DC-3 is currently being made airworthy. One of its two engines has been overhauled, while its second is still undergoing a rebuild; the exterior and interior restoration of the aircraft is nearing completion, while the installation of new carpeting and restored seats has been completed. This Douglas DC-3-G202A, registration number NC1945, serial number 3294, was built in Santa Monica, California in February 1941. It was delivered to Transcontinental and Western Airlines at Kansas City, Missouri, on March 4, 1941, and now resides in its original home city again.

===Lockheed Super &quot;G&quot; Constellation===

The Lockheed Super &quot;G&quot; Constellation (&quot;Super-Connie&quot;), which holds the distinction of being the first Constellation ever to be fully restored to flying condition, has not been flown to air shows in recent years. Originally donated to Save-A-Connie by Paul Pristo in 1986, maintenance is still ongoing, with the goal being to get the Connie back in the air. The aircraft has completed several successful four engine test runs and is well on the way to becoming airworthy once again. Nicknamed &quot;Star of America&quot;, this Constellation appeared in television and movie releases, as well as in several television commercials. It was featured in the Arts and Entertainment cable channel documentary &quot;First Flights&quot;, narrated by Astronaut Neil Armstrong, and the motion picture, &quot;Voyager&quot; released in the U. S. in 1992. The Connie&#x27;s interior was also used in scenes for the 1995 movie &quot;Ace Ventura When Nature Calls&quot;, starring actor Jim Carrey. It also appeared in the 2004 movie &quot;The Aviator&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese, which depicts the early years (late 1920s to the mid-1940s) of legendary film director and aviator Howard Hughes; the film starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Beckinsale, and Cate Blanchett.

===TWA&#x27;s corporate &quot;Moonliner II&quot; replica===
In 1956, after TWA became the corporate sponsor of Disneyland&#x27;s TWA Moonliner attraction in Anaheim, CA, Howard Hughes added a reproduction of Disney&#x27;s one-third scale Moonliner, known as the TWA Moonliner II, atop the southwest corner of Kansas City&#x27;s TWA Corporate Headquarters&#x27; Building, located at 18th Street and Baltimore, near downtown Kansas City. Disneyland&#x27;s TWA Moonliner was a promotional concept of what a TWA atomic-powered spaceliner would look like in the faraway year of 1986. When Hughes and Disney ended their business partnership in 1962 after Hughes sold TWA, the airline&#x27;s new management removed the Moonliner II reproduction from its roof and sold it to a local travel-trailer company called SpaceCraft.

When SpaceCraft moved to Concordia, Missouri, in 1970, the now all-white Moonliner II landed on the south side of Interstate 70 (between Kansas City and St. Louis) where SpaceCraft operated a campground near its trailer manufacturing plant. It slowly rusted on that spot for more than 25 years. In 1997 a Columbia lawyer who collected Disney memorabilia bought the deteriorating Moonliner II. He then began a long, careful restoration process, eventually bringing it back to its 1956 condition and sporting its original red and white TWA paint scheme. It is currently on loan to the museum for display to both airliner and TWA enthusiasts. The Moonliner II is located about five miles from its original TWA rooftop location.

===Lockheed L-1011 Tristar===
The museum announced in April 2009 that it was acquiring one of the last six remaining operational Lockheed L-1011 Tristar aircraft in the U.S., its donation to the museum made possible by Paul Pristo.

FAA approval was granted to ferry the aircraft from Roswell, New Mexico, (ROW) to Kansas City, Missouri, (MKC). The aircraft arrived safely on January 30, 2010, shortly after 3:00 pm. This aircraft first flew in 1972 under the red-and-white colors of hometown airline TWA. Due to its large size, it is parked south of the museum&#x27;s hangar at Wheeler Airport, the large tail hanging beyond the fence line surrounding the downtown airport&#x27;s apron. The aircraft is currently, slowly being restored to operational service.

As the engines were already sold prior to the purchase of the Tristar, it currently sits without engines on the apron outside the museum. Attempts to source mid-life engines are underway, so it is hoped will at least be a complete, operational example. It is possible to see it fly again, but maintenance needed to keep it in a certifiable flying condition is very time-consuming and expensive.

Although it can be easily viewed by the public, it is open for public access for special events only.

===Simulators===

====Lockheed L-1011 Tristar Simulator====
A full-motion, working Lockheed L-1011 Tristar simulator was donated to the museum by Orbital Sciences Corporation; it was never installed and later removed from the museum&#x27;s possession and transferred to a site in California.

====Lockheed L-1011 Tristar Cockpit Procedures Trainer====
The museum also has a cockpit procedures trainer for the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, originally belonging to Trans World Airlines.

====General Purpose====
A general purpose, custom-built flight simulator occupies part of the main foyer of the museum.

<doc id="1182424" wikidata="Q1691845" url="?curid=1182424" title="Observation car">
<text>An observation car/carriage/coach (in US English, often abbreviated to simply observation or obs) is a type of railroad passenger car, generally operated in a passenger train as the rearmost carriage, with windows or a platform on the rear of the car for passengers&#x27; viewing pleasure. The cars were nearly universally removed from service on American railroads beginning in the 1950s as a cost-cutting measure in order to eliminate the need to &quot;turn&quot; the trains when operating out of stub-end terminals.

The push-pull mode of operation removes this limitation. In Europe, various trains are now fitted with observation cars at either or both ends.
==Configuration==

The main spotting feature of observation cars is at the &quot;B&quot; end (tail) of the car; the walls of lightweight and streamlined cars usually round together to form a tapered U shape, smoothly or with a door, and larger panoramic windows were installed all around the end of the car. On older heavyweight cars, the rear end of the car consisted of an enlarged, canopied porch-like open vestibule platform area, with the door and enlarged windows set back into the car, giving wind-wing shelter from the draft. Whether old or new there was frequently a large open lounge in the B end where passengers could enjoy the view as they watched the track recede into the distance, and usually (but not always) equipped as a club car with a bar or buffet where soft drinks, cocktails and snacks could be purchased.
This differs from non-revenue business cars or private varnish, which may have featured (starting with the A end;) the normally locked center communicating door to a corridor along one side, leading to the salon with doors to a pantry and small galley which was often convertible to a dormitory for the chef and porter/steward at night with cutting board covering a sink, a combination oven/stove/hot-water-tank/steam-heating-boiler and diminished side door for loading supplies, then a private restroom/bathing-room, one or two deluxe private rooms for a personal secretary perhaps and the line&#x27;s vice president, a locked china/silver/liquor cabinet along the final dividing wall facing a large open multipurpose salon. The salon was often fitted with fold down overhead bunks above a retractable dining/conference table over sub-deck storage, a conductor&#x27;s desk with secured storage for train log, wine log, and merchant&#x27;s account books along with relevant gauges such as air pressure and speedometer at the track inspection viewing window recessed behind the expanded observation platform, which was fenced with opulent railing supporting an (optional) illuminated drumhead at the B end. Fresh drinking water, grey water, kerosene/fuel and other tanks crowded beneath the floor sill competed for space with heating/cooling, axle powered mechanical equipment, shore-power batteries and equipment/tool storage bins to support a self-sustaining/self-reliant car whether on the road or on a siding while making track orders. This variety of features is easy to spot with a variety of window placement and sizes, while observation car windows tend to be more uniform in size and placement.

Among North American railroads, their observation cars often featured any of a variety of upcharge revenue seating, reserved sitting/drawing rooms or sleeper roomettes in the forward section, in the form of reclining coach seats, plush parlor car chairs near side tables or bedrooms and the occasional crew dormitory, such configurations varying greatly between railroads. A lighted drumhead adornment, usually indicating the name of the train or the name/logo of the railroad would invariably (except on the Milwaukee Road, see below) be hung from the tail end of the observation car. Some early trains offered two observation cars: a traditional enclosed type for its compartment or &quot;first class&quot; passengers and an open type resembling a flat car for its tourist class riders.

==History==
When passenger trains were still the preferred mode of intercity transportation in America, observations often were used by those campaigning for public office, especially for the Presidency of the United States such as United States Railcar No. 1, the &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot;. On a whistle stop train tour the candidate&#x27;s train would pull into town and stop with the observation end at the station, then the candidate would appear on the observation platform to deliver his &quot;stump speech&quot;. The observation platform made a perfect temporary stage for just such an event. Like political candidates, famous personalities such as members of a royal family or film stars would use the open observation car end as a stage from which they would greet well-wishers and fans during public tours.

In more recent years, presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama have used a heavyweight observation car built by the Pullman Standard Company in 1930. This car is the Georgia 300.

==Industrial design==

While the cars manufactured by companies such as Pullman-Standard conformed to somewhat standard designs, some railroads created their own distinctive designs for observation ends. For example, the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s passenger trains were often rounded out with either a &quot;Skytop Lounge&quot; or a finned &quot;Beavertail observation&quot; the latter due to noted industrial designer Otto Kuhler. The Milwaukee&#x27;s observations were easily recognizable as the observation end of the cars were not only rounded, but also slanted toward the front of the car, often with windows extending up from the normal window height to the roofline. The Milwaukee&#x27;s observations, including the Skytops, lacked a drumhead, whose place was taken by a large oscillating rear light; instead, each tapered side carried the generic Milwaukee script name &quot;Hiawatha&quot; embossed on stainless steel trim flanking this light. The Milwaukee&#x27;s Skytops—four parlor cars built in the railroad&#x27;s own shops and six sleepers built by Pullman-Standard—were designed by noted industrial designer Brooks Stevens.
Six railroads bought dome-observation cars from Budd — the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and the Western Pacific Railroad for use on their joint &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, and the Canadian Pacific Railway for &quot;The Canadian&quot; and &quot;The Dominion&quot;. The WP touted this combination car type as &quot;the best of both worlds&quot; in passenger amenities. Budd also built observation cars for the Wabash Railroad for their &quot;Blue Bird&quot; trains between Chicago and St. Louis, and for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway for the &quot;Chessie&quot; which never went into service. The C&amp;O cars were sold to the Denver &amp; Rio Grande and ran on the &quot;Royal Gorge&quot;.

==Modern use==

As described above, the observation car on scheduled passenger trains has largely fallen victim to increased operational costs. An outstanding exception is Via Rail&#x27;s &quot;Canadian&quot;, which still operates on every triweekly trip between Toronto and Vancouver with the same dome observation-lounge cars in use on the train since 1955.

On several long distance Amtrak routes outside the Northeast Corridor where most trains are equipped with Superliner cars, there are Sightseer Lounge cars. These combine extra window exposure on an upper observation level with a lounge area and dormitory facilities on lower levels of the trains, though are generally placed mid-way through the train&#x27;s consist.

Some modern European trains, typically operating in the push-pull mode, are fitted with observation cars on one or both ends. The driver is located in a cabin on the side of the passengers, or above them like in the Swiss GoldenPass. The German ICE control cars feature a see-through driver cabin, with passenger seats behind the driver. In Italy the Settebello, in service between 1952 and 1992, and the Arlecchino also had the operator&#x27;s cabs located above the lounge compartments at both ends of the train.

<doc id="1182425" wikidata="Q19805006" url="?curid=1182425" title="Construction Specifications Institute">
<text>The Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) is a United States national association of more than 6,000 construction industry professionals who are experts in building construction and the materials used therein. The institute is dedicated to improving the communication of construction information through a diversified membership base of allied professionals involved in the creation and management of the built environment, continuous development and transformation of standards and formats, education and certification of professionals to improve project delivery processes, and creation of practice tools to assist users throughout the facility life-cycle. The work of CSI is currently focused in three areas being standards and publications, construction industry professional certifications, and continuing education for construction professionals.

==History==
CSI was founded in March 1948 by the specification writers of government agencies who came together to improve the quality of construction specifications. The institute&#x27;s efforts were essential in improving construction specification quality so that it could meet the demands of the post-war construction boom. Development of specifications best practices, promulgating standards and formats to improve the organization of specification information, professional education, and certification were cornerstones of the institute.

The Institute grew quickly to include specification writers in the private sector.

In November 2010, CSI acquired Building Systems Design (BSD) to help advance software tools for specifications development and communication of building information across the building team. BSD is a software firm that is a leading developer of commercial master specifications and construction cost estimating software. BSD is involved in the development and maintenance of several of CSI format documents including MasterFormat, UniFormat, and OmniClass, all of which relate to specifications and cost estimating. In 2017, BSD was the subject of a management buy-out backed by Caltius, leaving CSI with a minority stake in the business. In June 2019, BSD was acquired by Germany-based RIB Software, but will maintain its relationships with CSI and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC).

==CSI Standards==

=== MasterFormat ===
CSI publishes MasterFormat, which is a standardized classification for construction information, such as detailed construction project cost estimates or construction specifications. Since its debut under another title in 1963, MasterFormat consisted of 16 Divisions representing broad categories of construction, such as &quot;Masonry&quot;, &quot;Concrete&quot;, &quot;Electrical&quot;, &quot;Finishes&quot;, or &quot;Mechanical&quot;. In November 2004, a revised edition of MasterFormat was published that expanded the categories to 50 Divisions, reflecting the growing complexity of the construction industry, incorporation of a broader array of construction project types, and addition of facility life cycle and maintenance information into the classification. With this expansion, MasterFormat was positioned to help facilitate Building Information Modeling (BIM) to contain project specifications.

The MasterFormat standard serves as the organizational structure for construction industry publications such as the Sweets catalog with a wide range of building products, and master guide specification products such as MasterSpec and BSD SpecLink. MasterFormat helps architects, engineers, owners, contractors, and manufacturers classify the construction of work results using a variety of construction resources. The MasterFormat sections within the Divisions can also be used to reference performance and safety requirements generated by agencies such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), among others.

=== UniFormat ===
UniFormat is a construction classification system organized by functional elements in a construction project. Functional elements are defined as &quot;constituent parts of a construction entity with a characteristic function, form, or position.&quot; Unlike the content of MasterFormat, most content in UniFormat is described without reference to specific means of achieving the function the element serves.

The first edition of UniFormat was published by CSI in 1992. New and revised editions of UniFormat were published by CSI in 1998 and 2010.

Titles in UniFormat Levels 1 through 3 can be applied to most project descriptions and preliminary cost estimates. Levels 4 and below provide a more detailed breakdown of the functional elements.

=== SectionFormat/PageFormat ===
SectionFormat provides a standard arrangement of construction specification sections into three parts:

* Part 1 General, which includes administrative and procedural requirements unique to the section, expanding on subjects covered in Division 01 and adding information unique to the section. 
* Part 2 Products, which describes the systems, assemblies, equipment, products, materials, fabrications, and mixes that are to be incorporated into the project. 
* Part 3, Execution, which includes requirements for field/site installation or application, including preparatory actions and post-installation cleaning and protection.

This arrangement of specification section information is otherwise known as “three-part format” and is expected and commonplace throughout the North American construction industry. CSI first published SectionFormat in 1969, the most current edition was published in 2008.

PageFormat provides a recommended style guide for presenting the titles and content of construction specifications sections as described by SectionFormat. CSI first published PageFormat in 1975.

SectionFormat and PageFormat were published as separate publications until the 2008 edition, when they were combined into a single publication

=== GreenFormat ===
CSI&#x27;s GreenFormat is a standardized structure for organizing sustainable information elements associated with materials, products, systems, and technologies used in construction projects. By using this standardized format, manufacturers are assisted in identifying key product characteristics and providing designers, constructors, and building operators with information needed to help meet sustainable design and operation goals. The identification of the criteria, standards, and applicable certifications using GreenFormat provides designers, constructors, and building operators an effective way to evaluate the sustainable characteristics of materials, products, and processes for selection purposes.

GreenFormat arranges sustainable product information into five categories:

# Product General Information
# Product Properties
# Product Life Cycle
# Manufacturer Sustainability Policies
# Manufacturer Support Documentation

CSI first published GreenFormat in 2009, the most current edition was published in 2015.

===Uniform Drawing System===
CSI&#x27;s Uniform Drawing System is part of the National CAD Standard (NCS), together with the American Institute of Architects (AIA)&#x27;s CAD Layer Guidelines. Administered by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), the NCS coordinates these CAD-related publications to allow consistent and streamlined communication among owners and design/construction teams.

== CSI Practice Guides ==
The CSI Practice Guide series debuted in 2011. This series replaced the CSI Project Resource Manual (PRM), first published in 2004, and the CSI Manual of Practice (MOP), published from 1967 until 2004. The Practice Guides are best practice references for construction industry professionals.

=== Project Delivery Practice Guide ===
The CSI Project Delivery Practice Guide (PDPG) is the introductory volume in the Practice Guide Series. The PDPG presents an overview of the process needed to conceive, design, construct, and maintain a construction project. This Guide describes the many parts of that process and the inter-related roles of the various participants in the process. The second edition was published by CSI in 2017, and the most current edition, the third edition, was published by CSI in 2020.

=== Construction Specifications Practice Guide ===
The CSI Construction Specifications Practice Guide (CSPG) describes the process needed to effectively communicate a project design from the designer to the contractor and other members of the project team for the process of project conception, design, construction, and operation. The successful communication of a project design depends on the creation of a complete and coordinated set of construction documents both graphical and written.

The CSPG serves as a guidebook to the preparation, organization, and coordination of construction documents and focuses on the written description of a project and how that description relates to the other construction documents, the best practices for product selection and the roles and responsibilities of the parties to the process of design and construction.

The first edition of the CSPG, first published by CSI in 2011, is the most current edition.

=== Construction Contract Administration Practice Guide ===
The CSI Construction Contract Administration Practice Guide (CCAPG) provides a detailed discussion of the process of successfully delivering a construction project, focused on the roles of the various participants in the process and their relationship to one as described by contractual requirements in standard construction contracts. The responsibilities of team members are set forth in the contract documents and can differ depending on the method of project delivery selected for a project, the CCAPG describes these different responsibilities and recommendations for successful execution of a project.

The first edition of the CCAPG was published by CSI in 2011, and the current edition, the second edition, was published by CSI in 2020.

=== Construction Product Representation Practice Guide ===
The CSI Construction Product Representation Practice Guide (PRPG) provides a detailed discussion of the sales and marketing of products used in the construction process, and the contributions that knowledgeable product representatives are expected to make to the design, construction, and maintenance of facilities. The PRPG provides best practice recommendations for effective construction product representation.

The first edition of the PRPG, first published by CSI in 2011, is the most current edition.

== CSI Certifications ==
CSI is renowned in the construction industry for the longevity and discipline of its professional certification programs. These certifications all signify attainment of a level of knowledge and experience in specific practice areas in construction. All CSI certifications require meeting a minimum level of education or experience to qualify to sit for the certification exams, and completion of continuing education to qualify for renewal of the credential.

=== Construction Documents Technology (CDT) ===
First awarded in 1986, the CDT is a comprehensive overview for anyone who writes, interprets, enforces, or manages construction documents. The CDT credential was initially offered as a certificate, and was transitioned to a professional certification in April 2018.

Over 20,000 professionals currently hold the CDT credential.

=== Certified Construction Specifier (CCS) ===
Awarded since 1978, the Certified Construction Specifier (CCS) certification demonstrates excellence and experience in specifications and contract document preparation.

Over 800 professionals currently hold the CCS credential.

=== Certified Construction Contract Administrator (CCCA) ===
First awarded in 1991, The CCCA demonstrates deep knowledge about all facets of the construction project delivery process, the terms of and relationships established by standard construction contracts, and best practices for administration of those contracts to ensure construction results match owner needs.

Over 725 professionals currently hold the CCCA credential.

=== Certified Construction Product Representative (CCPR) ===
First awarded in 1989, The CCPR demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the construction process, the information needs of designers and contractors, and a superior ability in meeting those needs through effective communication of construction product properties and functions.

Over 150 professionals currently hold the CCPR credential.

<doc id="1182426" wikidata="Q7307118" url="?curid=1182426" title="Reference collection">
<text>A reference collection is a collection of objects maintained for the purposes of study, comparison, research, and authentication. While most commonly associated with libraries, reference collections can also be found in museums, archives, research institutions, and private holdings. 

These collections are generally non-circulating, meaning that items cannot be checked out or removed from the premises, to ensure their availability and preservation for future users; and thus are not typically meant for general reading or entertainment, but rather for specific, detailed study and consultation. They may be very expensive items, such as a current encyclopedia, which the institution does not want to risk losing.

==Overview==
The primary aim of reference collections is to provide a comprehensive and authoritative resource for researchers, students, professionals, and the general public. Reference collections are generally large undertakings maintained by institutions; instead of having a single representative of each object, they will typically have multiples, so as to illustrate variations and, sometimes, provide samples for comparisons.

Items within a reference collection may include books, journals, manuscripts, samples, artifacts, and other primary and secondary sources of information. A reference collection may also include an assortment of damaged or manipulated items, fakes and forgeries, or items to be used for education and public outreach. The items are curated with inclusion is based on their relevance, accuracy, authenticity, and potential for future research needs.

These collections are often permanently housed in public institutions and used on site, such as those managed by universities or GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives and museums). The earliest libraries were almost all reference libraries, but lending libraries became more common in the 18th century with circulating libraries subscription libraries, followed by free public libraries. Occasionally, reference collections (notably, highly specific and specialized collections or art collections) can be found in private ownership.

As new knowledge emerges and older materials become less relevant or outdated, the reference collection may undergo periodic reviews and updates to ensure its continued usefulness and reliability.

==Typical formats==
Within academic, open source, and research libraries, there are various sources that cater to specific types of information. The table below provides an inexhaustive overview of these typical information repositories.

==Significance in academic research==
In biology, reference collections, such as herbaria are a source of information about variations of populations within a species. They are also the repository of nomenclatural type specimens used to fix the circumscription of the taxonomic name.

In philately, reference collections are critical to expertization, since the characteristics differentiating authentic stamps from reprints, fakes, and forgeries are often too subtle to be described verbally.

<text>Scansion ( , rhymes with &quot;mansion&quot;; verb: &quot;to scan&quot;), or a system of scansion, is the method or practice of determining and (usually) graphically representing the metrical pattern of a line of verse. In classical poetry, these patterns are quantitative based on the different lengths of each syllable, while in English poetry, they are based on the different levels of stress placed on each syllable. In both cases, the meter often has a regular foot. Over the years, many systems have been established to mark the scansion of a poem.

==Overview==

Systems of scansion, and the assumptions (often tacit or even subconscious) that underlie them, are so numerous and contradictory that it is often difficult to tell whether differences in scansion indicate opposed metrical theories, conflicting understandings of a line&#x27;s linguistic character, divergent practical goals, or whether they merely constitute a trivial argument over who has the &quot;better ear&quot; for verse. There is even a debate among scholars as to what systems were inherited from Greek and Roman poetry.

To understand any form of scansion, it is necessary to appreciate the difference between meter and rhythm.

The rhythm of language is infinitely varied. All aspects of language contribute to it: loudness, pitch, duration, pause, syntax, repeated elements, length of phrases, and frequency of polysyllabic words. As C. S. Lewis observes, &quot;If the scansion of a line meant all the phonetic facts, no two lines would scan the same way.&quot;

Meter is another matter. It is an ordering of language by means of an extremely limited subset of its characteristics. In English (and in many modern languages) the language is ordered by syllabic stress. All other aspects of language are present, indeed they are vital to the rhythm of the verse; but they are not ordered by the meter.

However, marking stress is not the same as marking meter. A perfectly regular line of iambic pentameter may have anywhere from 2 to 9 stresses, but it is still felt to exhibit 5 pulses or beats. It can most easily be understood through the principle of relative stress. An unstressed syllable between 2 even slightly weaker syllables may be perceived as a beat; and the reverse is true of a stressed syllable between 2 even slightly stronger syllables. These phenomena are called &quot;promotion&quot; and &quot;demotion&quot;. Thus a syllable, regardless of its level of stress, that realizes a beat is &quot;ictic&quot;; and a syllable, regardless of its level of stress, that does not is &quot;nonictic&quot;. Ictus refers to the position within a line that is experienced as a beat, or to the syllable that fills it.

T. V. F. Brogan issues a stern warning about the temptations of overly detailed scansion:
Since meter is a system of binary oppositions in which syllables are either marked or unmarked (long or short; stressed or unstressed), a binary code is all that is necessary to transcribe it. ... It is natural to want to enrich scansion with other kinds of analyses which capture more of the phonological and syntactic structure of the line ... But all such efforts exceed the boundary of strict metrical analysis, moving into descriptions of linguistic rhythm, and thus serve to blur or dissolve the distinction between meter and rhythm. Strictly speaking, scansion marks which syllables are metrically prominent – i.e. ictus and nonictus – not how much. Scansions which take account of more levels of metrical degree than two, or intonation, or the timing of syllables are all guilty of overspecification.
Prosodists seldom explicitly state what they are marking in their scansions. For clarity, scansions that mark only ictus and nonictus will be called &quot;metrical scansions&quot;, and those which mark stress or other linguistic characteristics will be called &quot;rhythmic scansions&quot;.

==Elements==

Minimally, graphic scansion requires only two symbols, designating ictic and non-ictic syllables. These symbols are typically placed over the first vowel in every syllable. Some prosodists indicate only ictic (or, in rhythmic scansion, only stressed) syllables, but it is not ideal since the number, position, and character of non-ictic syllables is also metrically significant.

Additionally, many prosodists divide a line into feet—the minimal repeated units—using a vertical bar (|). When feet are thus designated, words that span feet are divided without hyphens, and any punctuation that occurs at a foot break is typically omitted.
 When I | consid | er how | my light | is spent

Not all prosodists agree that foot scansion is helpful.
For example, in trisyllabic measures (anapestic, amphibrachic, dactylic) it is often quite arbitrary where one divides the feet, and the salient fact seems to be the number of non-ictic syllables —in this case two— between each ictus, rather than whether the repeated pattern is imagined as ××/, ×/×, or /××. Foot analysis tends to imply that there is a special relationship among syllables within feet which does not apply across feet, but it is doubtful. Furthermore, iambic pentameter (despite its name) may be better described as a series of 10 positions than of 5 feet, especially since the sequence ××// may be interpreted as the swapping of ictic and non-ictic positions &quot;across feet&quot;, suggesting that if feet constitute any kind of boundary at all, it is a porous one indeed.

Finally, a caesura may be indicated. In the great majority of verse in English caesurae are not part of the metrical pattern, and generally it is better not to include them in English scansion. If they &quot;are&quot; to be marked: (1) if feet are being marked with a bar (|) then caesurae will be marked with a double bar (||) and will replace the foot marker when they occur in the same place; (2) if feet are not marked then caesurae may be marked with a single bar. The fourteener typically &quot;does&quot; have a metrical caesura; examples of style (1) and (2) are shown below:
 (1) The prince | ly pal | ace of | the sun || stood gor | geous to | behold
 (2) On stately pillars builded high | of yellow burnished gold

==Common 2- 3- and 4-level notations==

===2-level notations===

Metrical scansion explicitly requires a 2-level notation. Because of the variety of stress levels in language, 2-level notation is not adequate for a rhythmic scansion of any sensitivity. Yet, because of the confusion between rhythm and meter, the number of levels used is no sure indication of a prosodist&#x27;s intent.

Classical: This notation simply retains the classical symbols for &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; syllables – the macron (or longum) and breve (or brevis) – and repurposes them for &quot;ictic&quot; and &quot;nonictic&quot; (or &quot;stressed&quot; and &quot;unstressed&quot;). Because it quite literally doesn&#x27;t mean what it says, it is generally out of favor with metrists. This notation has been used by George Saintsbury and Edgar Allan Poe.

Slash &amp; breve: This notation replaces the macron with a slash (or the graphically similar acute accent), the more common symbol for either ictus or stress. Though the classical breve is still present, its pairing with slash indicates that it has been relieved of its original &quot;short&quot; meaning. This notation has the advantage that its symbols can be incorporated into words as diacritics (&quot;áccĕntĕd sýllăblĕ&quot;). But strictly speaking it can be seen as sending the mixed message that syllables are being marked as &quot;stressed&quot; or &quot;short&quot; which would be a nonsensical scansion. This notation has been used by Paul Fussell and Miller Williams.

Slash &amp; x: This notation is unambiguous (apart from the question of whether &quot;/&quot; indicates stress or ictus), easy to type, and frequently used. It is the notation preferred by the for Wikipedia articles displaying scansion. It could be utilized as diacritics only using the relatively obscure x above (&quot;aͯ&quot;) or times above (&quot;a̽&quot;) and therefore typically set in 2 lines (1 for the verse, and 1 for the scansion). This notation has been used by James McAuley, Timothy Steele, Robert B. Shaw, and the &quot;Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics&quot;; and as a secondary method by Derek Attridge.
 When Ajax strives, some rock&#x27;s vast weight to throw,
 The line too labours, and the words move slow;

This metrical scansion does not attempt to show the various rhythmic features that would occur in a competent reading. Nor does it imply that the line should be read monotonously in only 2 registers (&quot;when Ajax STRIVES some ROCK&#x27;S vast WEIGHT to THROW&quot;). Its simple function is to show how these lines relate to other lines of verse by marking whether syllables fill ictic or nonictic positions in the line.

===3-level notations===

Although both lines of Pope quoted above are metrically identical regular pentameters, they create that same basic metrical pattern in very different ways. To show it, one must note the rhythm, not just the meter, of the lines, and recourse must be had to additional levels of notation. In the instance below, the third symbol (\) designates stressed but demoted syllables:
 When Ajax strives, some rock&#x27;s vast weight to throw,
 The line too labours, and the words move slow;

If the meanings of all 3 symbols are defined and used strictly enough, a 3-level scansion &quot;can&quot; be both metrical and rhythmic; however, typically it will gravitate toward the rhythmic, as this scansion does. In the second line, &quot;and&quot; is both unstressed and ictic, but the scansion marks it only as unstressed. Although now a better representation of the &quot;rhythm&quot; of the line, Brogan&#x27;s chickens have come home to roost: the first line&#x27;s 3-level scansion may tend to obscure the basic metrical pattern, but the second line&#x27;s scansion actually falsifies it. (Does the second line comprise 4 or 6 metrical prominences? The answer is, still, 5, but that could not be deduced from this rhythmic scansion.)

Enid Hamer&#x27;s notation has also been used by Harvey Gross and Susanne Woods, and it is the graphical basis for Derek Attridge&#x27;s more complex notation (below).

===4-level notations===

4-level scansion is generally a sign of a more linguistically oriented prosodist at work. Otto Jespersen introduced his numeric notation in 1900 (in Danish; English translation in 1933). He occasionally added a 5th level, indicating a fully stressed syllable further emphasized by phrasal stress. In 1951 Trager &amp; Smith posited 4 phonemic levels of stress in English. It was in a broad linguistic context, not specifically pertaining to verse; nevertheless, in the 1950s and 1960s linguistically oriented prosodists (such as John Thompson, Harold Whitehall, and Seymour Chatman) attempted to use these 4 levels of stress to formulate a fuller explanation of meter. Chomsky &amp; Halle did not specifically address verse, but their notation of stress (effectively, Jespersen&#x27;s turned upside-down) was also influential; Chomsky &amp; Halle posited more than 4 levels of stress, but typically only 4 are used in scansion.

In addition to 4 levels of stress, Trager &amp; Smith posited 4 levels of pitch, and 4 levels of juncture (basically the smoothness of transition between syllables). All 3 suprasegmentals have been used by prosodists to map out lines of verse; it comes about as close to C.S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;all the phonetic facts&quot; as possible, and constitutes (as Chatman makes explicit), neither the meter nor even the &quot;phonetic facts&quot; of the text, but a &quot;transcription of one reading&quot; of the text. Here superscript numerals indicate pitch, and &quot;|&quot; and &quot;#&quot; indicate juncture.
 ²There was ³never a sound²|²beside the wood²|²but ³one# 

Jespersen was not the first to use numerals to mark stress, Alexander John Ellis used them (starting with 0 for least stress) as early as 1873. Nor were W.K. Wimsatt &amp; Monroe Beardsley the first to use multiple slashes: none other than Thomas Jefferson used a 5-level notational system of accents (&quot;////&quot; for strongest stress, down to &quot;/&quot; for little stress, and no mark for &quot;no&quot; stress).

Steele and McAuley have used Jespersen&#x27;s 4-level notation as a secondary method. Wimsatt, Woods, and &quot;The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics&quot; have used Chomsky&#x27;s &amp; Halle&#x27;s notation as a secondary method.

One of the primary virtues of 4-level scansion is that it helps clarify a surprisingly specific—and surprisingly controversial—debate. Take the rhythmically complex line:

 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought

Some prosodists hear &quot;-ions of sweet si-&quot; as a very light iamb, followed by a very heavy iamb, yielding a 2-level metrical scansion of:
 When to the sess | ions of sweet si | lent thought

(&quot;Foot&quot; markers are used here merely to emphasize the syllables in question. Recall that this metrical scansion does not imply that &quot;of&quot; is necessarily spoken with more emphasis than &quot;sweet&quot;, only that they fill ictic and nonictic positions, respectively.)

However, other prosodists hold that, just as the usual 2nd position ictus has been switched to 1st position, so the usual 6th position ictus has been switched to 7th, yielding:
 When to the sess | ions of sweet si | lent thought

In this case, &quot;-ions of sweet si-&quot; is sometimes taken as a pyrrhic foot followed by a spondee, and sometimes as a single 4-syllable unit (a minor or rising ionic) that replaces 2 iambic feet. It is a case in which 2-level scansion is felt to miss something essential even by some rather strict prosodists. In fact, Groves has shown that in such cases, where the ictus moves forward (as opposed to backward as in &quot;When to&quot;), &quot;each&quot; of the 4 positions in question has slightly different constraints that must be fulfilled for the line to be perceived as metrical. In layman&#x27;s terms, these constraints are most often realized as 4 rising positions; in Jespersen&#x27;s notation:

 3 2 1 4 1 2 3 4 1 4
 When to the sess | ions of sweet si | lent thought

In this case, everyone is somewhat right: the 4 positions &quot;are&quot; like a light then a heavy iamb, &quot;and&quot; like a pyrrhic followed by a spondee, &quot;and&quot; like a 4-syllable &quot;ascending foot&quot; that functions as a unit.

==Rhythmi-metrical scansion==

The two main approaches to scansion result in a conundrum: metrical scansion necessarily ignores significant differences in stress, the very signal that meter orders; yet rhythmic scansion obscures meter and tends to be overly subjective. Jespersen provided the components of a solution to this problem by both (1) marking multiple levels of syllable stress, and (2) defining the meter of iambic pentameter as a series of 10 syllabic positions, differentiated by rising or falling levels of stress. Numeric stress levels are as described above, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;B&quot; represent &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; positions in the line; alternatively (3) &quot;a/b\a/b...&quot; represents &quot;relatively&quot; stressed or unstressed positions, where the slash and backslash simply indicate stress levels increasing or decreasing.

 (1) 2 4 1 4 3 4 3 4 1 4
 When Ajax strives, some rock&#x27;s vast weight to throw,
 (2) a B a B a B a B a B

 (1) 1 4 3 4 1 2 1 4 3 4
 The line too labours, and the words move slow;
 (3) a /b \ a / b\a / b \ a /b \ a / b

However, Jespersen did not fully integrate his notation (even to the level implied by the scansions above). It remained for the Russian linguistic-statistical school to systematize it; in their 1968 study of Russian verse, A. N. Kolmogorov and A. V. Prokhorov used a system which made both stress and ictus explicit simultaneously. This basic approach has subsequently been used to scan English verse by Marina Tarlinskaja, Derek Attridge, and Peter L. Groves, though their systems differ in detail and purpose.

In addition to making rhythm and meter distinct, all three prosodists provide explicit rules for assigning stress levels so that, as far as possible, it becomes an objective process driven by lexicon and syntax, rather than depending upon the &quot;ear&quot; of the scanner. Their works must be consulted for details, but a simplified version of Groves&#x27;s rules can provide a first approximation:
* Primary stress: the primarily stressed syllable in content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs).
* Secondary stress: the secondarily stressed syllables of polysyllabic content words; the most strongly stressed syllable in polysyllabic function words (auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions); subsidiary stress in compound words.
* Unstressed: unstressed syllables of polysyllabic words; monosyllabic function words.

&quot;For comparative purposes, the following table is a somewhat simplified rendition of these scansion systems. Attridge (1982) and Groves scan ictus/nonictus on a separate line.&quot;

Tarlinskaja, Attridge, and Groves each exhibit distinct conceptions regarding the dispositions of ictus and nonictus.

===Marina Tarlinskaja===

Tarlinskaja uses scansion as a basis for statistical analysis of verse. She has used several versions of the scansion levels shown above, some more and some less fine-grained, and some reduced to numerical values; but all relate to this basic 3 × 2 structure. In the metrical component of her scansion, she (like Jespersen) marks the ictic and nonictic positions of the &quot;meter&quot;, not of the &quot;line&quot;. It allows her to compare patterns across hundreds or thousands of verse lines statistically, using a consistent matrix of positions. Thus in the line
 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought

where both Attridge and Groves (and most prosodists, for that matter) would say that the first syllable is ictic, Tarlinskaja rigidly keeps the ictus in the second position, which is its &quot;average&quot; position across iambic pentameter.

===Derek Attridge===

Attridge&#x27;s scansion is intended to be broadly applicable, using a few symbols and rules to describe a wide range of English lines consistently, without &quot;a priori&quot; reducing them to one metrical system. Like Tarlinskaja, he considers that ictus and nonictus (in his notation B for &quot;beat&quot; and o for &quot;offbeat&quot;) &quot;always&quot; alternate, but matches beats to prominent syllables by allowing offbeat positions to be filled by 0, 1, or 2 syllables (represented by ô, o, and ǒ respectively). The top line represents his &quot;single-line&quot; scansion from 1995, and the lower lines uses his original two-line system of 1982; they are &quot;theoretically&quot; identical, only &quot;graphically&quot; different.

 / x x / x x / [x]/ x /
 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
 +s -s -s +s -s -s +s +s -s +s
 B ǒ B ǒ B ô B o B

===Peter L. Groves===

To date, Groves has put forward his system only as an explanation of iambic pentameter (or &quot;the English heroic line&quot; as he prefers to call it), though elements may be applicable to other accentual-syllabic meters.

He begins his rhythmic scansion with a three-level label for all syllables, but goes much further by elaborating rules describing how contiguous syllables impinge upon each other. The result is a map of the lexical and syntactic character of a line&#x27;s syllables, which &quot;results&quot; in stress; rather than a representation of stress levels themselves.

Ictus (S for &quot;strong&quot;) and nonictus (w for &quot;weak&quot;) have constraints on which syllable statuses can fill them. These rules for matching syllable status and metrical position are called &quot;mapping rules&quot;, and strict (e.g. Alexander Pope) versus loose (e.g. William Shakespeare) styles of iambic pentameter can be defined by applying different mapping rules.

Further, while his metrical scansion begins as a familiar wSwSwSwSwS, he allows &quot;w&quot; and &quot;S&quot; to trade places under certain conditions, and when they do their mapping rules are altered, requiring additional symbols. In the first (rhythmic) line of scansion, syllables that impinge on their neighbors are connected by hyphens; in the second (metrical) line, positions that have switched places and therefore altered their mapping rules are connected by hyphens.

==Other methods of scansion==

===Musical scansion===

In 1880, Sidney Lanier published &quot;The Science of English Verse&quot;, in which he developed a novel theory exploring the connections between musical notation and meter in poetry. Although some figures such as T.S. Osmond and Harriet Monroe praised it, others did not view it kindly. For example, Vladimir Nabokov in his &quot;Notes on Prosody&quot; says: &quot;In my casual perusals, I have of course slammed shut without further ado any such works on English prosody in which I glimpsed a crop of musical notes.&quot; (pages 3–4) Harvey Gross&#x27; criticism also described the theory as lacking in good sense, saying &quot;it scatters sand in the eyes and pours wax in the ears.&quot;

One account cited that musical scansion was an experimental technique during the nineteenth century but was obscured by the then-existing conventional scansion. An interpretation of the notion of musical scansion states three theories: 1) beats occur at regular intervals of time; 2) syllables of a verse can be grouped in measures or &quot;bars&quot;; and 3) beats form a hierarchy of strength.

===Robert Bridges===

===George R. Stewart===

Stewart&#x27;s notation influenced John Crowe Ransom and John Thompson, though they did not use his full roster of symbols.

===Generative metrics===
==Other symbols==
*The metrical &quot;triseme&quot; (⏗), &quot;tetraseme&quot; (⏘) and &quot;pentaseme&quot; (⏙) occur in the &quot;Miscellaneous Technical&quot; section of the Unicode standard and appear to be used in scansion.

<text>Steven Hanson Blake (born February 26, 1980) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. After winning the 2002 NCAA Championship with Maryland, Blake was selected by the Washington Wizards with the 38th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Over his 13-year NBA career, Blake had stints with the Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Detroit Pistons, and three stints with the Portland Trail Blazers.

==High school career==
Blake spent his freshman and sophomore year at Miami Killian High School and then transferred to Miami High School, where he played with another future NBA player, Udonis Haslem. Miami won consecutive state championships, but after the Miami New Times exposed the fact that Blake and other players, under head coach Frank Martin (himself later an NCAA Final Four coach), were using fake addresses to enroll in the school, the Stingarees were forced to forfeit their entire 1998 schedule. After the FHSAA banned him from playing for any public high school in Florida again, Blake attended Oak Hill Academy before enrolling at the University of Maryland.

==College career==
After high school, Blake attended the University of Maryland. Blake was the team&#x27;s starter from the first game of his freshman year and was the first ACC player to compile 1,000 points, 800 assists, 400 rebounds and 200 steals. He finished his career 5th in NCAA all-time career assists with 972. Widely known for his superb passing ability, Blake helped lead the Terrapins to a Final Four appearance (2001) and the 2002 NCAA championship; less well known for his scoring, Blake did average 11.6 points per game in his senior year. He averaged over six assists per game in each of his four years, including averages of 7.9 and 7.1 in 2002 and 2003, respectively. For his efforts, he was named to a variety of all-ACC teams during his career, including the rookie and defensive squads, capped by a first-team All-ACC spot his senior year. At the start of the 2003–04 basketball season, Blake&#x27;s uniform number (25) became only the 15th to be retired to the rafters of Maryland&#x27;s Comcast Center.

==Professional career==

===Washington Wizards (2003–2005)===
Blake was selected by the Washington Wizards with the 38th pick in the 2003 NBA draft. He averaged 5.9 points, 2.8 assists, and 18.6 minutes per game while playing in 75 games his rookie season with the Wizards. In his second season Blake&#x27;s playing time decreased to 14.7 minutes and only 44 games played.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2005–2006)===

In September 2005, Blake (then a restricted free agent with the Wizards) was offered a contract by the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Wizards declined to match. This became the second reunion with former Maryland Terrapin and Washington Wizards backcourt teammate Juan Dixon, who also signed with the Trail Blazers in the 2005 off-season.

In Blake&#x27;s first season with the Blazers, he became a starter and played a significant role when Sebastian Telfair was injured. Blake&#x27;s playing time increased from 14.7 minutes and 44 games with only one start in 2004–05 to 26.2 minutes and 68 games with 57 starts in 05–06. Blake reestablished himself as a terrific passer and fundamental point guard claiming third in the NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio. He also increased his field goal percentage by 11%.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2006–2007)===
In July 2006, Blake was traded (along with Brian Skinner and Ha Seung-Jin) to the Milwaukee Bucks for Jamaal Magloire.

===Denver Nuggets (2007)===
On January 11, 2007, Blake was traded to the Denver Nuggets in return for Earl Boykins and Julius Hodge. Blake started in 40 of the 50 remaining games of the Nuggets&#x27; 2006–07 season, and in five playoff games in a 4–1 first-round loss to the San Antonio Spurs.

===Second Portland Trail Blazers stint (2007–2010)===
Blake became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2007, and agreed to a three-year deal with the Portland Trail Blazers on July 13, 2007.

The 2008–09 season saw a rise in Blake&#x27;s numbers. Through his first 38 games, he averaged a career-high 11.7 points per game, while also achieving career highs in free throw percentage and three-point percentage.

On February 22, 2009, Blake tied an NBA record with 14 assists in the first quarter of a game against the Los Angeles Clippers.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2010)===
On February 17, 2010, Blake was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers with Travis Outlaw and $1.5 million in cash for Marcus Camby.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2010–2014)===

On July 8, 2010, Blake officially signed a four-year $16 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. In his first season for the Lakers, Blake averaged 4 points in 20 minutes per game. He missed games due to chicken pox. In his second season, he averaged 5.2 points in 23.2 minutes per game. He also played 5 of 53 games as a starter. He dealt with a costochondral fracture (fractured cartilage connecting the rib to the sternum). Statistically, he was a disappointment in those first two seasons under coach Phil Jackson&#x27;s triangle offense and then coach Mike Brown&#x27;s post-up offense, neither of which catered to his natural read-and-react skills.

In the 2012–13 season, his training camp was spoiled when he punctured his foot stepping on a spike strip in a beach parking lot. In November 2012, Blake was fined $25,000 by the NBA for inappropriate language towards a fan. He started five straight games after a knee injury to starter Steve Nash. However, Blake was sidelined starting in November after suffering an abdominal strain that required surgery. He experienced groin problems during his recovery before returning in late January after missing 37 games. He was more comfortable playing under coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni, who had replaced Brown early in the season. In the playoffs that season, Blake left Game 2 in the first round against San Antonio after injuring his right hamstring and was declared out indefinitely.

===Golden State Warriors (2014)===
On February 19, 2014, Blake was traded to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for MarShon Brooks and Kent Bazemore.

===Third Portland Trail Blazers stint (2014–2015)===
On July 10, 2014, Blake signed with the Portland Trail Blazers to a reported two-year, $4.2 million deal. On February 20, 2015, Blake changed his jersey number from #25 to #5 in a tribute to Jerome Kersey who died two days prior.

On June 19, 2015, Blake exercised his player option with the Trail Blazers for the 2015–16 season.

===Detroit Pistons (2015–2016)===
On June 25, 2015, Blake was traded, along with the draft rights to Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Mason Plumlee and the draft rights to Pat Connaughton. On July 13, 2015, he was traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Quincy Miller.

Blake&#x27;s final NBA game was played in Game 4 of the 2016 Eastern Conference First Round on April 26, 2016. The Pistons would lose the game 98–100 to the Cleveland Cavaliers with Blake recording 3 points, 2 assists and 1 rebound.

===Sydney Kings (2016)===
On October 22, 2016, Blake signed with the Sydney Kings for the rest of the 2016–17 NBL season. He made his debut for the Kings on October 30, recording 12 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals in an 87–78 win over the Brisbane Bullets. On November 28, he was granted leave by the Kings and returned to the United States indefinitely to address a private family matter. On December 6, Blake announced that he would not be returning to Sydney, effectively ending his stint with the Kings. In nine games for the Kings, he averaged 5.9 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.

==Coaching career==
===Portland Trail Blazers (2017–2019)===
On September 27, 2017, Blake was reported to have joined the Portland Trail Blazers as a coaching intern. For the 2018–19 season, Blake was promoted to an on-court assistant for the Trail Blazers.

===Phoenix Suns (2019–2020)===
On June 26, 2019, Blake was hired as an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns. On July 18, 2020, Suns head coach Monty Williams announced that Blake was no longer with the team.

<doc id="1182454" wikidata="Q1018564" url="?curid=1182454" title="Byrd Amendment">
<text>The Byrd Amendment is also known as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (CDSOA). It passed as title X of .

==Substance==
The act is American legislation closely associated with its chief sponsor, Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. The act changed the disposition of funds raised from duties on imports that the US government has determined to be subsidized or otherwise unfairly priced. Prior to the act, those funds were incorporated into the US budget. The Act specifies that the funds be distributed to the US companies that file pricing complaints. In short, this meant that non-US firms which sell below cost price in the US can be fined, and the money given to the US companies who made the complaint in the first place.

==Duration==
Congress enacted the Byrd Amendment on October 28, 2000, and repealed it on December 21, 2005.

==History==
On July 21, 2001, the European Commission and eight other countries – Australia, Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand — filed a formal protest with the World Trade Organization (WTO). The European Commission claimed that since 2000, US companies had received $1 billion in anti-dumping fees redistributed to them under the Byrd Amendment. In 2002, the WTO ruled the Byrd Amendment wholly illegal. It said that the European Union (EU) and the other countries could introduce measures which penalize the US for up to 72% of the monies raised and distributed through the Byrd Amendment.

On April 4, 2005, now with the permission of the WTO, the EU announced plans to implement limited sanctions on a selection of US goods, charging a 15% levy on U.S. paper, farm goods, textiles and machinery from May 1, 2005. This was in light of the continuing failure of the United States to bring its legislation in conformity with its international obligations. Also, on May 1, Canada imposed a 15% surtax sanction on US imports of cigarettes, oysters and live swine. On September 1, 2005, the Japanese government introduced 15% retaliatory duties on U.S. steel imports.

For years, President George W. Bush called for the Act&#x27;s repeal; however, this was met with little progress. Eventually, after growing pressure on multiple fronts, the 109th United States Congress in December 2005 and January 2006 repealed the amendment. The act&#x27;s provisions stayed in place until October 1, 2007, and money continued to be redirected to companies during this time. For example, American Italian Pasta Company, in a Form 10-Q dated August 6, 2008, recognized &quot;dumping and subsidy offset payments&quot; attributed to the Act of $2.959 million for its fiscal year 2007 and $4.64 million for fiscal year 2008.

<doc id="1182458" wikidata="Q7283921" url="?curid=1182458" title="Rail accidents at Morpeth">
<text>The town of Morpeth in Northumberland, England, has what is reputed to be the tightest curve ( radius) of any main railway line in Britain. The track turns approximately 98° from a northwesterly to an easterly direction immediately west of Morpeth Station on an otherwise fast section of the East Coast Main Line railway. This was a major factor in three serious derailments between 1969 and 1994. The curve has a permanent speed restriction of .

==1877 derailment==

On 25 March 1877, the 10:30 p.m. train from Edinburgh to London Kings Cross was derailed on the curve. It was travelling at only . The officer from the Railway Inspectorate who held the inquiry, Captain Henry Tyler, found that faulty track was to blame. He also commented perspicaciously &quot;It would obviously be better if a deviation line could be constructed, to avoid the use of such a sharp a curve on a main line&quot;. This &quot;deviation line&quot; has still not yet been built .
==1969 derailment==

On 7 May 1969 a northbound &quot;Aberdonian&quot; sleeping car express train from London to Aberdeen derailed on the curve. The train in question consisted of Deltic locomotive &quot;The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers&quot; hauling 11 carriages. Six people were killed, 21 were injured and the roof of the station&#x27;s northbound platform was damaged. The train had been travelling at . The driver had apparently allowed his attention to wander because he was thinking about an official letter that he had been handed when booking on duty, asking for an explanation of time lost on a previous journey. 

The investigation into this accident led to the implementation of alerts for major speed restrictions via the Automatic Warning System. However, despite the recommendation for this system stemming from the accident at Morpeth and the common reference to the &#x27;Morpeth warnings&#x27;, the gradually stepped speed restriction for the Morpeth curve did not meet the guidelines for this system and it was not installed until at least after the 1984 derailment.
==1984 derailment==

The southbound sleeper service from Aberdeen to London was derailed at the same location on 24 June 1984. There were no fatalities but 29 passengers and 6 train crew were injured. Two houses narrowly escaped being demolished by the derailed carriages. The train was estimated to have been travelling at .

The train involved was led by Class 47 locomotive number 47452, hauling seven British Rail Mark 3 sleeping cars between two British Railways Mark 1 brake vans.

The driver involved in this accident, Peter Allan, was prosecuted for being under the influence of alcohol, but acquitted after what was described by the Expert Witness Institute as an ambush defence. Mr Allan had consumed alcohol both before and after booking on duty, but the defence countered that he suffered from bronchitis and had in the past experienced severe coughing fits that had caused him to fall unconscious.
==1992 accident==

A further accident, unrelated to the Morpeth curve, occurred on 13 November 1992, when a collision between two freight trains at Morpeth led to one fatality. A Class 56 locomotive ran into the back of a pipe train. The cab of the locomotive was crushed and the driver was killed. The accident occurred during engineering work and was the result of the locomotive driver and the signaller at Morpeth failing to come to a clear understanding concerning required movements.
==1994 derailment==

On 27 June 1994 an express parcels train crashed at the curve. The locomotive and the majority of carriages overturned, without fatalities, but causing injury to the driver. As with the 1969 and 1984 accidents, the train had been travelling at . The Health and Safety Executive estimate that trains will overturn at above , and noted that &quot;Morpeth 1994 was a very serious event, which could easily have been fatal&quot;.

He is considered one of the fathers of the Canadian system of Medicare, along with his fellow Saskatchewanian, Tommy Douglas.

==Early life==
Hall was born in Saint-Colomban, Quebec, the fourth of eleven children of James Hall and Alice Shea. His parents were descendants of generations of impoverished farmers of Irish descent in the Saint-Colomban area. Seeking a better life, his family moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1910, when Hall was age 12, to take over a dairy farm. The Halls were Roman Catholics, and Emmett served as an altar boy at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Saskatoon.

Hall was in the audience on July 29, 1910, when Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier laid the cornerstone for the University of Saskatchewan. Hall studied law at the College of Law at the University of Saskatchewan, putting himself through by teaching French in local schools. One of his classmates was John Diefenbaker, future Prime Minister of Canada. He received his law degree from the University of Saskatchewan in 1919.

Hall attempted to enlist in 1917, but was rejected as medically unfit, because he had been born blind in one eye.

In 1922, Hall married Isabel Parker, a legal stenographer from Humboldt, Saskatchewan. They had two children, John Hall, who became a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Marian Wedge, who like her father, entered the legal profession and was appointed to the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench.

==Legal career==
Hall was called to the bar in 1922 and spent the next thirty-five years in private practice. He became a leading litigator in the Saskatchewan bar, with a reputation for being hard-nosed.

In 1928, at 29 years of age, Hall appeared in the Supreme Court of Canada as counsel for the appellants in &quot;Glenn and Babb v. Schofield&quot;. His clients were farmers who were being sued by the owner of some free-range horses. The horses had eaten a large amount of grain which had spilled from the farmers&#x27; grain bins. One of the horses died from over-eating, and others were sickened. The Supreme Court ruled that Hall&#x27;s clients had taken reasonable steps to store their grain from spillage and dismissed the action against them. The case was the first of Hall&#x27;s six appearances in the Supreme Court. Hall was successful in five of those cases, losing only one case. In one of his successful cases, the Supreme Court paid him the ultimate accolade for an appellate lawyer: the Court did not find it necessary to call on him in oral argument and ruled in his favour based solely on Hall&#x27;s written arguments.

Hall acted as the defence counsel in the 1928 &quot;Maloney v. Dealtry&quot; libel trial. The plaintiff John James Maloney was a prominent member of the Ku Klux Klan who came to Saskatchewan to promote the Klan in preparation for the upcoming 1929 Saskatchewan general election which had shown signs of religious tension being a decisive factor, with the Klan raising anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic fervour. The plaintiff accused the defendant of seditious libel for comments made in a publication he printed and which, Hall argued as counsel, were seditious because they had caused a public fracas. Hall lost the case and the defendant was fined $200 and prohibited from publishing such material in the future. The Ku Klux Klan burnt an effigy of Hall in response to his participation in the case.

In 1935, Hall, along with a fellow Saskatoon lawyer, Peter G. Makaroff, defended the cases of many of the On-to-Ottawa trekkers against charges brought against them for their part in the Regina riot of July of that year. One police officer, Charles Miller was killed in the line of duty, and a trekker later died of injuries from the riot. Many believed that the trekkers were bolsheviks, but Hall and Makaroff believed that the riot had been provoked by the police. They were successful in having many of the charges quashed. Hall lost friends for his role in defending the trekkers.

In 1935, Hall was appointed King’s Counsel. Later, he was elected a bencher of the Law Society of Saskatchewan, becoming President of the Law Society in 1952. He also taught law at the College of Law.

==Community involvement==
Hall was active in the Saskatoon community, serving on both the Saskatoon Catholic Separate School Board and the Catholic Hospital Board. In the 1948 provincial general election, Hall stood for election for the Progressive Conservative Party, in the riding of Hanley. He was defeated, coming in third place, behind the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and Liberal candidates.

==Judicial career==
In 1957, Hall was appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench for Saskatchewan by his old law school classmate, John Diefenbaker, who had just won a minority government. He was elevated to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in 1961, when he was appointed Chief Justice of Saskatchewan. The next year, Diefenbaker appointed him to the Supreme Court of Canada. Hall served on the high court until his retirement in 1973.

One of Hall&#x27;s most influential judgments was &quot;Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General)&quot;, dealing with aboriginal title. Hall wrote compelling reasons arguing that aboriginal title existed in British Columbia under the common law. The Supreme Court divided on the issue, 3-3, so his opinion was not implemented. However, his judgment is credited with persuading Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to open land-claim negotiations with First Nations. Hall&#x27;s judgment also contributed to the entrenchment of aboriginal rights in the Constitution in 1982.

In 1967, Hall was the sole dissent in the Supreme Court&#x27;s reference decision upholding the 1959 conviction of Steven Truscott for capital murder. In his dissent, Hall argued that the trial had not been conducted according to law and that grave errors had been committed. He would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

==Public policy advocate==

===Royal Commission on Health Services===
In 1961, while Chief Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench, Hall was appointed by the Diefenbaker government to chair a royal commission on the national health system. The question of health care was a major issue at the time. In the 1960 Saskatchewan general election, the CCF government of Tommy Douglas had run on a platform of implementing a universal health care plan. The issue was extremely controversial. When the Saskatchewan government enacted the Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Bill in the fall of 1961, it triggered a strike by the doctors in Saskatchewan, which led to some changes to the provincial plan. The federal government&#x27;s choice of Hall to lead the commission reassured the medical community, which had pressed for an inquiry to look at alternatives to the universal medicare system proposed by the Saskatchewan government.

The Hall Commission heard from hundreds of witnesses. Hall closely questioned them, and was struck by the inequities in the Canadian health system and the lack of access to health care. He continued to conduct the inquiry after his appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Hall Commission issued its report in 1964. To the surprise of many, Hall recommended the nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan&#x27;s model of public health insurance. In fact, his recommendations went further than the Saskatchewan plan, proposing additional publicly funded benefits, such as free dental coverage for schoolchildren and welfare recipients and free prescription glasses and drugs for the needy and elderly. &quot;The only thing more expensive than good health care,&quot; he argued, &quot;is no health care.&quot;

By the time of his report, the Diefenbaker government had been replaced by the Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson. The Pearson government was deeply divided on the issue of health care, and took some time to reach a decision. Eventually, the federal government implemented the medicare system which was at the core of Hall&#x27;s recommendations, on a cost-share basis with the provinces. The new system came into force in July, 1968.

===Additional public inquiries===
Hall chaired numerous other royal commissions and public inquiries.

While he was still on the Supreme Court, he conducted a public inquiry into education, at the request of the government of Ontario. Reporting in 1968, the Hall-Dennis Report recommended child-centred education and a flexible curriculum. The report also argued against the separation of handicapped children and slow learners from other students. The report was blamed by opponents as contributing to a decline in educational standards.

After he retired from the Supreme Court, Hall conducted an inquiry into the rail system in western Canada, with a particular focus on grain transportation. He also served as an arbitrator and mediator in strikes by national railway workers, grain handlers, and air traffic controllers. Hall also made recommendations on reforms to court structures.

In 1979, the federal government appointed Hall to conduct a follow-up inquiry into the current state of the Canadian health care system. His report, issued a year later, raised concerns about the growth of extra-billing and user fees. His report eventually led to the introduction of the Canada Health Act, which prohibited those practices.

==University chancellor==

Hall served as the chancellor of two different universities: the University of Guelph, from 1971 to 1977, and the University of Saskatchewan, from 1979 to 1986. By a quirk of fate, he followed two former leaders of the federal Progressive Conservative party in the two positions. His predecessor as chancellor of Guelph was George Drew, who led the party from 1948 to 1956. At Saskatchewan, he succeeded his old law school chum, John Diefenbaker, who died in 1979.

==Legacy==

Historian J. L. Granatstein has described Hall as the most important Canadian judge of the 20th century.

Hall had been indelibly marked by his experience going through the Great Depression in Saskatchewan. One of his friends and fellow Saskatchewanian, Ramon Hnatyshyn, former Governor General of Canada, commented: &quot;They were tough times. You had a chance to see real deprivation and the importance of helping your fellow citizen.&quot;

One of Hall&#x27;s biographers, Dennis Gruending, characterised him as an &quot;Establishment radical.&quot; Gruending wrote that Hall was a study in contradictions. A member of the Establishment, he was more interested in justice than in privilege. Despite reaching the elite heights of his profession, he never forgot his own humble origins or the needs of the ordinary people that he encountered during his long life. That was also reflected in his work on the Supreme Court, where he defended civil liberties and protected minority rights. Hall believed that Canadian society ought to embrace ethnic diversity, alleviate poverty, and redress the shameful treatment of Aboriginal peoples.

On his retirement from the Supreme Court in 1974, Hall was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, &quot;for a lifetime of service to the law and for his contributions to the improvement of health services and education.&quot;

At the age of 81, as he was wrapping up his second inquiry into health care, he was asked by a reporter when he would stop his activities. &quot;When they bury me,&quot; Hall replied. He remained active well into his 90s. During the federal election of 1993, he strongly criticised Preston Manning, the leader of the Reform Party of Canada, for proposing user fees for health care and the complete withdrawal of the federal government from the medicare system.

Hall suffered a stroke in late 1993, shortly after celebrating his 95th birthday at a public dinner in his honour. The stroke confined him to a wheelchair.

Hall died on November 12, 1995, just short of his 97th birthday.

<doc id="1182469" wikidata="Q19666" url="?curid=1182469" title="Current TV">
<text>Current TV was an American television channel which broadcast from August 1, 2005, to August 20, 2013. Prior INdTV founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt, with Ronald Burkle, each held a sizable stake in Current TV. Comcast and DirecTV each held a smaller stake.

The channel started out as a user-generated content channel with content made by viewers in 15-minute blocks. The channel later switched formats to become an independent news network aimed at progressive politics. Neither format brought the success that Gore and Hyatt had wanted.

On January 2, 2013, it was announced that Current TV had been sold by Gore and Hyatt to Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera Media Network. AJMN stated it planned to shut down the Current TV channel, retain its off-air staff, and to launch a new New York City-based channel named Al Jazeera America (using Current&#x27;s distribution network). Current had operated in the same way with Newsworld International, a predecessor to Current. They also said they planned to scrap the channel&#x27;s programming lineup and brand. Al Jazeera America replaced Current TV on August 20, 2013, at 3:00 pm Eastern, 2:00 pm Central time. The former headquarters would become the home of Al Jazeera&#x27;s all-online digital channel AJ+.

==History==
===2002–2006: Launch===
After the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Gore and Hyatt wanted to start a conventional cable news network. The plan evolved into making a viewer-generated channel aimed at an audience demographic age 18–34.

On May 4, 2004, INdTV Holdings, a company co-founded by Gore and Hyatt in 2002, purchased Canada-based cable news channel NewsWorld International (NWI) from NBCUniversal for the express purpose of launching their new network with the space on some digital cable lineups (and DirecTV) that NWI had. The new network would not have political leanings, Gore said, but would serve as an &quot;independent voice&quot; for a target audience of people between 18 and 34 &quot;who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own.&quot; Other reports said that Gore hoped that the channel would help change the tide of &quot;consolidation and conglomeratization&quot; of the media by leading the change to &quot;democratization.&quot; The news network was said to be a combination between CNN, MTV, and blipverts. In the summer of 2004, Gore and Hyatt announced their new network, named INdTV, with a series of public recruitment events. The first of these events was held at the Bambuddha Lounge in San Francisco&#x27;s Tenderloin, on August 25, 2004.

On April 4, 2005, the former vice president with business partner Hyatt announced that they had changed the name of the network from &quot;INdTV&quot; to &quot;Current TV&quot;. The new television network launched in the United States at midnight EDT on the morning of August 1, 2005. The first person heard on the channel was Conor Knighton, a staple during the early years of the channel introducing the channel with the show Google Current.

===2006–2008: Expansion and Yahoo! partnership===
On September 20, 2006, Current TV started a short-lived partnership with Yahoo! to supply topic-specific &quot;channels&quot; to the Yahoo Video website. Called the Yahoo! Current Network, the first four channels, &quot;Current Buzz&quot;, &quot;Current Traveler&quot;, &quot;Current Action&quot; (about action sports), and &quot;Current Driver&quot; quickly became the most popular videos on the Yahoo Video web site. There were Yahoo branded segments on Current TV, similar to the Google Current segments. Additional web channels were planned. However, on December 6, 2006, Yahoo and Current TV announced the end of their relationship. Madeline Smithberg co-creator of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, was the Executive Producer for this project.

On October 6, 2006, a deal was announced with BSkyB to create a localized UK and Ireland version of Current TV for its Sky satellite service. This version went live on March 12, 2007, on Sky channel 229 (later moving to 183) and Virgin Media channel 155. The first documentary aired on the launch was &#x27;Tracking William, a Night With a Paparazzo&#x27; from director Daniel Florencio, a prolific contributor of the channel. In 2007, Current TV started video-on-demand service on Virgin Media. Current TV was also added to the Freewire IPTV network on channel 178. The channel closed on March 11, 2012, following BSkyB&#x27;s withdrawal of support and a failed rescue attempt from Current TV.

On January 31, 2007, Current TV launched on Dish Network.

On September 16, 2007, Current TV won an Emmy award for Best Interactive Television Service at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. This was the first year in which this Emmy was presented during the primetime broadcast. The award was presented by Masi Oka of &quot;Heroes&quot; fame and MySpace founder Tom Anderson (through their own computers), and Al Gore and Joel Hyatt accepted the award on their behalf.

On February 8, 2008, it was announced that the network would also be available on the Italian Sky Italia satellite digital platform on channel 130. According to the official website, broadcasts started on May 8, 2008. On June 6, 2008, it was announced that the network would also be available on the Italian 3 DVB-H mobile operator, free of charge. The channel closed on July 31, 2011, following failed distribution renegotiations with Sky Italia.

Current TV partnered with Twitter for the 2008 Presidential and Vice-Presidential debates, allowing viewers who watched the Current TV version of the debates to post live on Twitter and have their opinions shown on screen, live.

===2009–2010: Financial troubles and IPO plans===
On January 28, 2009, Current Media Inc. announced that it intended to launch an initial public offering on the NASDAQ to raise US$100 million. However, it announced in early April that it was scrapping the plan due to &quot;current market conditions&quot; and that no securities had been sold, and all activity regarding the proposed IPO had been discontinued.
In June 2009, Current TV received approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to establish a Canadian version of the channel, which would be a joint venture of Current TV and the CBC, with the CBC taking 80 percent ownership. The channel would be required to feature at least 35% Canadian content. The new service was planned to begin in Fall 2009, pending approval by the Treasury Board, but those plans were put on hold later that year.

In July 2009, Current TV made a series of changes due to financial reasons and the failed IPO. CEO Joel Hyatt resigned to a new vice president position and was replaced by Mark Rosenthal, the former COO and president of MTV Networks, with a plan to reform Current TV to more traditional programing. Lisa Derrick of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; predicted that Current TV would undergo a transformation similar to MTV&#x27;s transformation during Mark Rosenthal&#x27;s 1990s tenure at MTV, from MTV&#x27;s multi-minute music video format to longer 30 minute/1 hour reality television programing. Ultimately its assorted pod format was discontinued in lieu of traditional 30-minute block programing. Some elements of the pod format survived inside the themed 30-minute programing. In July 2009, 80 in-house staff were laid off, about 25% of Current&#x27;s staff, and plans were announced to air licensed TV series and films and other content that was not produced by Current in-house or by the VC2 system. Andrew Wallenstein of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; predicted Current would make its targeted demographic a decade older from early 20s to early 30s, and add more less-serious entertainment programing to its then mostly news and reality/documentary format.

In late 2009, after the announcement of the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, Comcast Corporation submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that revealed it owned a ten percent stake of Current Media LLC. Current received three Emmy nominations in the news and documentary category in 2009.

In mid-2010, Current&#x27;s Vanguard journalism program&#x27;s piece, &quot;Oxycontin Express&quot;, received a Peabody Award, a first for both Mariana van Zeller, the journalist behind the story, and Current TV. Current also received a Headliner award. Around this time, a report by Reuters on the network&#x27;s ongoing problems suggested that it could have blossomed into something akin to YouTube&#x27;s video-sharing platform, MSNBC&#x27;s role as a left-leaning news outlet, or even the Oprah Winfrey Network. &quot;In retrospect&quot;, the report concluded, &quot;what&#x27;s distinctive about Current&#x27;s troubles was that Gore&#x27;s vision had so much potential. It&#x27;s uncanny how close he was to capitalizing on several key trends that transformed the media world, only to watch others do so.&quot;

===2009: North Korea incident===
On March 17, 2009, the North Korean military detained two American journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, working for Current TV, after they allegedly crossed into North Korea from China. On March 30, 2009, North Korean state media reported that preparations were under way for indictments and a trial, saying, &quot;The illegal entry of US reporters into the DPRK [Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea] and their suspected hostile acts have been confirmed by evidence and their statements.&quot; The two faced trial on June 4. On June 8, Reuters reported that the two reporters were found guilty of illegal entry and committing &quot;hostile acts against the DPRK&quot; and subsequently sentenced to twelve years of hard labor. On August 4, BBC News reported that Lee and Ling were pardoned amidst a visit by former U.S. president Bill Clinton to North Korea.

===2011 major format changes===

Beginning early in 2011, Current TV started implementing major changes in programming and personnel, beginning with the hiring of Keith Olbermann. To signify these changes, Current unveiled new imaging and a new logo in May 2011, designed by branding firm Wolff Olins.

On February 8, 2011, Keith Olbermann announced that he had been hired to host a new primetime show on Current TV and was named Chief News Officer with an equity stake in the network. In April 2011, Olbermann announced that his nightly program would retain the same title from his time at MSNBC. On June 20, 2011, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; relaunched on Current TV. The program aired Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m. Eastern Time and was based out of New York City. Olbermann stated on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; that Current TV was planning to make a nightly news segment consisting of his show and others that would launch later on Current TV.

In August 2011, Current announced that it had hired former CNN Bureau Chief and SVP of Programming David Bohrman as the network&#x27;s new president. Bohrman later announced that after filling out its prime-time lineup, Current would also gradually begin shifting towards &quot;a full daytime, morning schedule of news, information, analysis, conversation, context – all based on the events of the day&quot; from an independent, progressive perspective.

On September 15, 2011, Current also announced that it had hired Shelley Lewis, former CNN and PBS executive producer, as executive vice president of programming.

On September 20, 2011, the network announced that Cenk Uygur of the internet-based TYT Network would be launching a TV edition of the internet news program &quot;The Young Turks&quot; in the fourth quarter of 2011. The program was broadcast from Los Angeles and aired weekdays at 7 p.m. Eastern Time. The program premiered on December 5, 2011.

On September 21, 2011, network president David Bohrman named Jason Odell as executive vice president of technology. Odell had an extensive career at both CNN and NBC, and was most recently known for creating (along with David Bohrman) and implementing CNN&#x27;s &quot;holographic&quot; technology during election coverage.

On October 12, 2011, the network announced that it had hired former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm to host her own weekday prime-time program &quot;The War Room with Jennifer Granholm&quot;. The program launched on January 30, 2012, at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

===2012 major format changes===
On March 5, 2012, Current announced an upcoming weekday morning block of programming with TV-friendly simulcasts of &quot;The Stephanie Miller Show&quot; (under the name &quot;Talking Liberally: The Stephanie Miller Show&quot;) and &quot;The Bill Press Show&quot; (under the name &quot;Full Court Press: The Bill Press Show&quot;). This was interpreted by Mediaite&#x27;s Political Editor and White House Correspondent Tommy Christopher as an attempt to compete against MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; (which aired from 6am to 9am). This morning block moved to Free Speech TV after Current TV folded and became Al Jazeera America.

On March 30, 2012, Current announced that Keith Olbermann had been fired and would no longer host a show on their network. A statement released by network founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt explained how the network&#x27;s &quot;values are no longer reflected&quot; in Current&#x27;s relationship with Olbermann, and that former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer would begin hosting &quot;Viewpoint&quot; effective immediately in the time slot previously occupied by Olbermann.

On April 18, 2012, Current announced that California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom would host a show titled &quot;The Gavin Newsom Show&quot;, while concurrently serving as lieutenant governor.

In June 2012, it was formally announced that Joy Behar would be getting another talk show, &quot;Joy Behar: Say Anything!&quot;, premiering September 4, 2012 on the Current TV network. Its content was expected to be in line with her previous HLN series &quot;The Joy Behar Show&quot;. Before the new show&#x27;s launch, Behar began acting as fill-in host for Eliot Spitzer&#x27;s Current TV talk show, &quot;Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer&quot;, starting on July 18, 2012.

===2013: Acquisition by Al Jazeera===

On January 2, 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network announced that it had purchased Current Media, LLC and would be closing down the Current TV channel while launching and integrating the remains of Current into a new American news channel titled Al Jazeera America using its distribution network. Prior to the sale, it was believed that Al Gore and Joel Hyatt each owned approximately twenty percent of Current Media, business magnate Ronald Burkle owned about twenty-five percent, and Comcast and DirecTV each owned more than five percent. The terms of the deal were undisclosed. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the purchase was about US$500 million. The purchase by Al Jazeera occurred after an attempt by TheBlaze to purchase the media company was rejected in 2012.

Immediately after the announcement, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, which both broadcast Current TV to nine million American homes, announced they would be dropping the channel, but said they would consider airing Al Jazeera America. It was previously reported in April 2012 that TWC and Bright House were considering to drop the channel due to low ratings. Al Jazeera America still replaced Current TV on Comcast, Dish Network, Verizon and DirecTV. AT&amp;T dropped Current TV the morning before it changed to Al Jazeera America prompting a lawsuit for breach of contract from Al Jazeera Media Network. Time Warner and Bright House later added Al Jazeera America on December 6, 2013, after a new deal was signed 2 months earlier. AT&amp;T would add the channel on June 27, 2014.

Defending his decision, Current TV chairman Al Gore wrote: &quot;I am incredibly proud of what Current has been able to accomplish. But broadcast media is a business, and being an independent content producer in a time of increasing consolidation is a challenge.&quot; In a news release, Al Jazeera Director General Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani said,
: &quot;By acquiring Current TV, Al Jazeera will significantly expand our existing distribution footprint in the U.S., as well as increase our newsgathering and reporting efforts in America [...] We look forward to working together with our new cable and satellite partners to serve our new audiences across the U.S.&quot;
The Al Jazeera network also expected to increase its U.S.-based staff to a total of more than 300 employees and retain most of Current&#x27;s staff.

In addition to ending the Current TV channel, Al Jazeera announced it was scrapping the channel&#x27;s programming lineup, as well as its brand. On January 2, Cenk Uygur, host of the weekday &quot;Young Turks with Cenk Uygur&quot;, stated at the time that the Current TV show would continue for at least three months and that he was open to staying with the new network. Later, after the end of Current, in a Los Angeles Times interview, Uygur remarked about the loss of the television show that he felt &quot;relieved&quot; that he could move on and focus on his web show and site and that he &quot;was exhausted from doing the two shows at once;&quot; also that &quot;The future is overwhelmingly online&quot; and he was excited to turn his energies there. It was also mentioned that after the acquisition of Current, he had brief talks with Al Jazeera America about whether there would be a place for him and the show, but both sides agreed that Uygur, known for political rants, would not fit well with the company&#x27;s plans to build a news source with a more neutral tone.

That same day, Jennifer Granholm, host of &quot;The War Room with Jennifer Granholm&quot;, announced that she would leave the channel as a result of the acquisition, as did Gavin Newsom, host of &quot;The Gavin Newsom Show&quot;, who was reported to have planned on leaving the network earlier. On Sunday, January 6, Eliot Spitzer announced that he had left the network and his weekday show &quot;Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer&quot;.

It was announced in an article in Politico at the time of the purchase that Bill Press didn&#x27;t expect to continue his show with Al Jazeera once the change officially took place. Press also didn&#x27;t expect Stephanie Miller to continue her show on Al Jazeera. Press said he would look for TV coverage to replace Current but expected having trouble finding a replacement. On August 1, 2013, Press announced that his show&#x27;s simulcast would move to Free Speech TV on September 3, 2013. Stephanie Miller announced later after a hiatus from television syndaication that her show would also move to Free Speech TV in January 2014.

In a January 22, 2014 article in Politico Al Jazeera spokesman Stan Collender said the network&#x27;s launch would be pushed back to within six months, and would create &quot;multiple hundreds of new jobs&quot; and new bureaus around the country. They announced the hiring of 105 total jobs for the new network, with 98 in New York and seven in Washington, D.C. On July 3, 2013 Ali Velshi announced on his Twitter account that the network would replace Current on August 20, 2013.

The last live show on Current was &quot;Viewpoint&quot; with John Fugelsang, ending on August 15, 2013. Al Jazeera America launched and replaced Current on August 20, 2013, at 3:00pm EDT.

On August 16, 2014, Al Gore launched a lawsuit against Al Jazeera Media Network claiming a residual payment of $65 million of the sale proceeds held in an escrow account, due in 2014, remained unpaid. In September Al Jazeera Media Network launched a lawsuit against Al Gore.

Al Jazeera America shut down on April 12, 2016, citing the &quot;economic landscape and the highly competitive nature of the American media market&quot; as reasons to shut down the channel. After use by three networks since 1994, the channel space folded after Al Jazeera failed to sell it to another network.

==Remains==
Al Jazeera maintained Current TV&#x27;s former San Francisco headquarters as the headquarters for its all online digital channel AJ+ until late 2018 which included use of the former &quot;The War Room&quot; studio and its podcast network Jetty. The building was also home to Al Jazeera&#x27;s digital team and other departments as well as the base for the show &quot;Fault Lines&quot;.

Elsewhere, &quot;The Young Turks&quot; still use their main news desks, background graphics and lighting from Current TV in their new studio; Bill Press uses the same cameras and equipment from his Current TV simulcast to show his simulcast on Free Speech TV. Press also has the same background on camera featuring the &quot;Full Court Press&quot; name from the former Current TV simulcast.

During Al Jazeera America&#x27;s existence, Current&#x27;s New York City studios were home to the Al Jazeera America shows &quot;On Point with Ali Velshi&quot; and &quot;Third Rail&quot;. Many of the people formerly employed by Current stayed on with the new network, most notably Christof Putzel, formerly of the Current TV series &quot;Vanguard&quot;, who became an investigative reporter for Al Jazeera America&#x27;s show &quot;America Tonight&quot;. Michael Shure formerly of &quot;The War Room&quot; left but came back to the channel as a political contributor. David Shuster, another former Current TV face, remained with the network becoming a reporter and fill-in host.

All of the videos on Current TV&#x27;s YouTube channel were removed. However, as of March 2021, the channel remains online, albeit with no content.

<text>Viridian is a blue-green pigment, a hydrated chromium(III) oxide, of medium saturation and relatively dark in value. It is composed of a majority of green, followed by blue. The first recorded use of &quot;viridian&quot; as a color name in English was in the 1860s. Viridian takes its name from the Latin &quot;viridis&quot;, meaning &quot;green&quot;. The pigment was first prepared in mid-19th-century Paris and remains available from several US manufacturers as prepared artists&#x27; colors in all media.

== History ==
Viridian pigment was first prepared in 1838 in Paris by Parisian color chemist and painter Pannetier alongside his assistant Binet as a hydrated form of chromium oxide. The preparation process was demanding, expensive, and shrouded in secrecy. The French chemist C. E. Guignet developed and patented a cheaper manufacturing method in 1859 that enabled larger distribution and use of the pigment. This method involved calcining a combination of boric acid and potassium bichromate, then washing the material.

Winsor and Newton&#x27;s catalogue listed the pigment as early as 1849. It was used as early as 1840 in a work by J. M. W. Turner. Viridian was in prominent use by the mid-nineteenth century, but was less popular than three to four times more affordable alternatives including emerald and chrome greens.

== Visual characteristics ==
Viridian is a bright shade of spring green, which places the color between green and teal on the color wheel, or, in paint, a tertiary blue–green color. Viridian is dark in value, has medium saturation, and is transparent .

==Variations of viridian==
===Paolo Veronese green===
Paolo Veronese green is the color that is called &quot;Verde Verones&quot; in the &quot;Guía de coloraciones&quot; (&quot;Guide to colorations&quot;) by Rosa Gallego and Juan Carlos Sanz, a color dictionary published in 2005 that is widely popular in the Hispanophone realm.

&quot;Paolo Veronese green&quot; was a color formulated and used by the noted 16th-century Venetian artist Paolo Veronese.

&quot;Paolo Veronese green&quot; began to be used as a color name in English sometime in the 1800s (exact year uncertain).

== Permanence ==
Viridian is considered durable and permanent as an artist&#x27;s pigment. Viridian is unaffected by temperatures up to 260 °C (500 °F), but it is unsuitable for use in ceramic glazes. Viridian is compatible with all pigments in all media, and has high oil absorption. Pure pigment formulations of viridian are hard and may separate in tubes, but adding barium sulfate in small quantities enables easy grinding and dispersion.

==Notable occurrences==
Although viridian is not a frequent color name in English, it is used in a number of cultural references, probably because it is derived from &quot;viridis&quot;, the Latin word for green, so using the word &quot;viridian&quot; sounds more elegant than simply referring to the Old English word &quot;green&quot;.

<doc id="1182477" wikidata="Q767608" url="?curid=1182477" title="Sepia (color)">
<text>Sepia is a reddish-brown color, named after the rich brown pigment derived from the ink sac of the common cuttlefish &quot;Sepia&quot;. The word &quot;sepia&quot; is the Latinized form of the Greek σηπία, &quot;sēpía&quot;, cuttlefish.

== In the visual arts ==
Sepia ink was commonly used for writing in Greco-Roman civilization. It remained in common use as an artist&#x27;s drawing material until the 19th century. Grisaille is a painting technique developed in the 14th century in which a painting is rendered solely in tones of gray, sepia, or dark green. In the last quarter of the 18th century, Professor Jakob Seydelmann of Dresden developed a process to extract and produce a concentrated form of sepia for use in watercolors and oil paints.

Sepia toning is a chemical process used in photography which changes the appearance of black-and-white prints to brown. The color is now often associated with antique photographs. Most photo graphics software programs and many digital cameras include a sepia tone filter to mimic the appearance of sepia-toned prints.

== Other uses ==
In the 1940s in the United States, music intended for African American audiences was generally called race music or sepia music until the development of the expression rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). There was a magazine for African-Americans called &quot;Sepia&quot;, which existed from 1947 to 1983 (although the name &quot;Sepia&quot; was only applied after a change of ownership in 1953).

Acclaimed Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky used a sepia tone in his 1979 science-fiction film &quot;Stalker&quot; to visually distinguish scenes set in the ordinary world from the world of the forbidden Zone, which is portrayed in color.

<doc id="1182482" wikidata="Q15516042" url="?curid=1182482" title="Herbert Wechsler">
<text>Herbert Wechsler (December 4, 1909 – April 26, 2000) was an American legal scholar and former director of the American Law Institute (ALI). He is most widely known for his constitutional law scholarship and for the creation of the Model Penal Code. &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; has identified Wechsler as one of the most cited legal scholars of the 20th century.

== Early life and education ==
Wechsler entered City College of New York at 16 and graduated in 1928, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in French. He enrolled at Columbia Law School, where he served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; and graduated in 1931. After graduation, he joined the faculty and took a one-year leave to clerk for Justice Harlan F. Stone of the US Supreme Court.

== Lawyer ==
In 1940, Wechsler went to Washington, D.C., to work for the Department of Justice. He argued five cases in front of the US Supreme Court during that period.

During World War II, Wechsler served as assistant attorney general in charge of the War Division. This included leading the litigation for Korematsu v. U.S., the case challenging the Japanese Internment during World War II.

In 1945 and 1946, he was a principal assistant to US Judge Francis Biddle and US Alternate Judge John J. Parker at the Nuremberg trial, the trial of the principal Nazi war criminals. He then returned to Columbia Law School, where he remained an active professor until 1978, when he took emeritus status.

In 1959, Wechsler delivered his Holmes lecture at Harvard Law School, &quot;Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law.&quot; It was also around this time that Wechsler authored a number of casebooks that changed ideas about criminal law and the federal courts. In 1963, Wechsler&#x27;s proposed official draft of the Model Penal Code was approved, bringing to a close a decade-long project at the American Law Institute. His wife, Doris Wechsler, noted that he considered the Model Code to be his greatest achievement. Shortly after the approval of the Model Code, Wechsler was named director of the Institute, a position which he held until 1984.

In 1964, Wechsler argued the seminal case &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot; before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in that case unanimously held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments barred awards of damages to a public official for defamation relating to his or her official conduct unless the public official proves &quot;actual malice.&quot;

Wechsler served as the first chair of the New York Commission on Judicial Nomination from 1977 until 1982.

== Accomplishments ==
During Wechsler&#x27;s tenure as director, the American Law Institute completed the second restatement of the Conflict of Laws, Contracts, Judgments, and Torts as well as the original restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States and large parts of the Second Restatement of Property. The Institute also conducted various studies in federal taxation and completed the Federal Securities Code, the Model Land Development Code, the Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, the Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, and made major revisions to the Uniform Commercial Code. The ALI&#x27;s Principles of Corporate Governance and the current Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States were also conceived, initiated, and developed under his direction.

Following his retirement as director of the ALI in 1984, Wechsler remained active in the Institute&#x27;s activities as a member of the council until his death in 2000.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1993, Wechsler became the third recipient of the American Law Institute&#x27;s Henry J. Friendly Medal for &quot;outstanding achievement in promoting reform and clarification of the law&quot; and for the way that his &quot;outstanding intelligence, integrity, and devotion to the law... enriched the subjects of Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, and Federal Jurisdiction, as well as legal thinking generally.&quot;

Wechsler also received the Association Medal of the New York City Bar Association for exceptional contributions to the honor and standing of the bar in the community.

Wechsler was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

<text>A block design test is a subtest on many IQ test batteries used as part of assessment of human intelligence. It is thought to tap spatial visualization ability and motor skill. The test-taker uses hand movements to rearrange blocks that have various color patterns on different sides to match a pattern. The items in a block design test can be scored both by accuracy in matching the pattern and by speed in completing each item.

==Historical background==
David Wechsler adapted a block design subtest for his Wechsler-Bellevue test, the predecessor of his WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), from the Kohs block design test developed in 1920 at Stanford University by Samuel Calmin Kohs. A later revision of the Kohs test by Hutt incorporated the time taken to complete each item into the scoring of the test. Wechsler followed that practice in making both accuracy and speed factors in scoring the test.

==Neuropsychological assessment==

Good performance on the block design test is indicative of appropriate functioning of the parietal and frontal lobes. Head injury, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and stroke can severely reduce the performance of an individual on the block design test. Additional evidence suggests impairment in block design performance among schizophrenic and bipolar disorder patient populations, though this represents only preliminary findings.

== Spatial ability ==

The block design test is also a relatively accurate measure of spatial ability and spatial visualization ability used in daily life. The block design test is considered one of the best measures of spatial ability, although it is subject to certain problems of administration, such as anxiety or over-cautious responding. Linda Kreger Silverman has proposed the block design subtest as the best putative measure of spatial ability among the Wechsler subtests. One well-known example of high spatial ability from history is Albert Einstein.

== Autism spectrum disorders==
Uta Frith, in her book &quot;Autism: Explaining the Enigma&quot;, addresses the superior performance of autistic individuals on the block design test. This was also addressed in an earlier paper. One article demonstrates the differences in construction time in the performance of the block design task by individuals with and without Asperger syndrome. An essential point is that in an unsegmented version of the task, people with Asperger syndrome performed significantly faster than individuals without Aspergers.

== Science and engineering aptitude ==

Recent research has demonstrated a connection between spatial ability and math and science proficiency at the highest levels. A 2002 study in the Lancet demonstrated that high spatial ability was related to the performance of surgery.

== Spatial ability in pilots ==

In 1993, Dror et al. found that pilots&#x27; performance was superior to non-pilots on a test of the speed of mental rotation. Although the block design test is characterized as a test of spatial visualization, not mental rotation, spatial visualization ability as measured by the block design test is highly correlated to mental rotation ability.

==Research in an educational context==

As performance on the block design test has been suggested as a predictive measure for performance in fields such as engineering and physics. Felder, at North Carolina State University, has developed a learning style questionnaire that attempts to assess spatial ability in an educational context.

<text>Learning sciences (LS) is the critical theoretical understanding of learning, engagement in the design and implementation of learning innovations, and the improvement of instructional methodologies. LS research traditionally focuses on cognitive-psychological, social-psychological, cultural-psychological and critical theoretical foundations of human learning, as well as practical design of learning environments. Major contributing fields include cognitive science, computer science, educational psychology, anthropology, and applied linguistics. Over the past decade, LS researchers have expanded their focus to include informal learning environments, instructional methods, policy innovations, and the design of curricula.

== Domain definition ==
As an emerging discipline, LS is still in the process of defining itself. Accordingly, the field&#x27;s identity is multifaceted and varies between institutions. However, the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) summarizes the field as follows: &quot;Researchers in the interdisciplinary field of learning sciences, born during the 1990s, study learning as it happens in real-world situations and how to better facilitate learning in designed environments – in school, online, in the workplace, at home, and in informal environments. Learning sciences research may be guided by constructivist, social-constructivist, socio-cognitive, and socio-cultural theories of learning.&quot; ISLS has a large worldwide membership, is affiliated with two international journals: &quot;Journal of the Learning Sciences&quot; and &quot;International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning&quot;, and has previously sponsored the biennial Computer Supported Collaborative Learning conference and International Conference of the Learning Sciences on alternate years. Since 2020, these two conferences have been combined as a unified ISLS Annual Meeting with one track for each conference.

Although controlled experimental studies and rigorous qualitative research have long been employed in learning sciences, LS researchers often use design-based research methods. Interventions are conceptualized and implemented in natural settings to test the ecological validity of dominant theory, as well as to develop new theories and frameworks for conceptualizing learning, instruction, design processes, and educational reform. LS research strives to generate principles of practice beyond the particular features of an educational innovation to solve real educational problems, giving LS its interventionist character.

== History ==

Several significant events contributed to the international development of learning sciences. Perhaps the earliest history can be traced back to the cognitive revolution.

In 1983 in the United States, Jan Hawkins and Roy Pea proposed a collaboration between Bank Street College and The New School for Social Research to create a graduate program in learning sciences. The program, known as &quot;Psychology, Education, and Technology&quot; (PET), was supported through a planning grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. However, the program was never established due to the requirement of hiring new faculty.

In 1988, Roger Schank&#x27;s arrival at Northwestern University contributed to the development of the Institute for Learning Sciences. In 1991, Northwestern initiated the first LS doctoral program, designed and launched by Pea as its first director. The program accepted their first student cohort in 1992. Following Pea&#x27;s new position as dean, Brian Reiser assumed the role of program directorship. Since then, many LS graduate programs have appeared globally, and the field continues to gain recognition as an innovative and influential field for education research and design.

&quot;The Journal of the Learning Sciences&quot; was first published in 1991, with Janet Kolodner as founding editor. Yasmin Kafai and Cindy Hmelo-Silver took over as editors in 2009, followed by Iris Tabak and Joshua Radinsky in 2013. &quot;The International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning&quot; was established as a separate journal in 2006, edited by Gerry Stahl and Friederich Hesse. Although these journals were relatively new within education research, they rapidly escalated into the upper ranks of the Educational Research section of the Social Sciences Citation Index impact factor rankings.

In August 1991, the Institute for the Learning Sciences hosted its first International Conference for the Learning Sciences (ICLS) at Northwestern University (edited by Lawrence Birnbaum and published by the AACE, but no longer available). In 1994, ICLS hosted the first biennial meeting, which also took place at Northwestern. The International Society of the Learning Sciences was later established in 2002 by Janet Kolodner, Tim Koschmann, and Chris Hoadley.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

By integrating multiple fields, learning sciences extends beyond other closely related fields. For example, learning sciences extends beyond psychology, in that it accounts for and contributes to computational, sociological and anthropological approaches to the study of learning. Similarly, LS draws inspiration from cognitive science, and is regarded as a branch of cognitive science; however, it gives particular attention to improving education through the study, modification, and creation of new technologies and learning environments, and various interacting and emergent factors that potentially influence human learning.

Many LS researchers employ design-based research methodology. The growing acceptance of design-based research methodology as a means for study is often viewed as a significant distinction of LS from the many fields that contribute to it. By including design-based research within its methodological toolkit, learning sciences qualifies as a &quot;design science&quot;, sharing common characteristics with other design sciences that employ design science methodology such as engineering and computer science. Learning sciences is also considered by some as having some degree of overlap with instructional design, although the two communities developed in different ways, at times emphasizing different programs of research. These differences are described in greater detail in a 2004 special issue of &quot;Educational Technology&quot;.

Design-based research is by no means the only research methodology used in the field. Additional methodologies include computational modeling, experimental and quasi-experimental research, and non-interventionist ethnographic-style qualitative research methodologies.

<text>A berlinetta (from ; ) is a sports coupé, typically with two seats but also including 2+2 cars. The original meaning for &quot;berlinetta&quot; in Italian is “little saloon”, derived from the Berlin carriage. Introduced in the 1930s, the term was made popular by Ferrari in the 1950s. Maserati, Opel, Alfa Romeo, and other European car manufacturers, as well as Chevrolet in the United States, have used &quot;berlinetta&quot; as model label.

==Berlinette==
Berlinette is the French name for a Berlinetta, which is defined as a sporty, low-profile two-door type of automobile body style closely related to the coupé. 

After World War II, the term came to refer to a small vehicle with enclosed coachwork similar to a two-door berline, or sedan in France. It supplanted use of the term &quot;coach&quot; for a similar but older body style, which had replaced the even older term &quot;demi-berline&quot;.

The most common recent usage was in reference to the Alpine A110 sports car, which was often simply called &quot;la Berlinette&quot;.

<text>The Impossibles (1994–1998, 2000–2002, and 2012) are a rock music band from Austin, Texas, originally on the Fueled by Ramen label. They played ska punk prior to their first break-up in 1998, but transitioned to a more indie rock/alternative sound upon reuniting.

In their time together, The Impossibles played shows with Less Than Jake, Sugarcult, The Toadies, Recover and others.

Lead singers Rory Phillips and Gabe Hascall were also in the Fueled by Ramen group Slowreader following the band&#x27;s second break-up, in 2002.

On February 13, 2012, the Impossibles announced a reunion show and launched a new website.

==History==
===Early years: 1994–1998===
They started as a band called the Fat Girls, with Craig&#x27;s brother Brian singing lead vocals. Brian was replaced by Gabe, who had been playing bass in a hardcore band called Loophole. He started as just a singer, but began also playing guitar pretty quickly as it made him more comfortable while on stage. They rebranded themselves The Impossibles, after the Hanna-Barbera cartoon of the same name. They also took to wearing matching baseball jerseys as &quot;their version of Kiss&#x27; make-up.&quot;

Their music was described as a cross between Operation Ivy and Weezer, with notable influences also including Avail and Nirvana. They recorded a demo tape and a split seven inch with Austin pop punk band Dynamite Boy, and they gained the attention of Less Than Jake drummer Vinnie Fiorello who signed them to his start-up label Fueled by Ramen. Their first release on the label was actually a re-release of their self-titled debut CD, which had previously been self-released under the Red Five Records label.
During this time, their music found its way onto compilations from labels large and small, including Moon Ska, Asian Man, Drive Thru, and many, many others.

In 1997, the band found themselves at a crossroads. Their popularity was growing and a tour with Mu330 had gone well, but college and relationships were pulling them in different directions. They announced their intention to disband in late 1997, but did not play their &quot;final&quot; show until Super Bowl Sunday, 1998 along with Less Than Jake and Riverfenix (later Fenix*TX) at Liberty Lunch in Austin, Texas. The &quot;Back for the Attack&quot; EP which came out about that time was then considered to be their swan song.

===After the original break-up: 1998–2000===
Rory by far was the most active member of the band after the breakup, playing bass on the Missile Command album &quot;Sexy, Sexy Confidence&quot;, and briefly forming the band Go Kappa! with Jerm Pollet. After that dissolved, he formed, played shows with, and recorded an EP with Imbroco, a band which featured the half of the band Mineral that was not in the Gloria Record. After Imbroco imploded, he shared some solo demos of some rock songs with John Janick, Jr who was running Fueled by Ramen Records, and he suggested starting a band with Jamie Woolford, formerly of Fueled by Ramen ska/punk band Animal Chin. The resulting pair called themselves The Stereo and began work on their debut full length, &quot;Three Hundred&quot;.

During this time, Fueled by Ramen released posthumous albums compiling previous releases as well as unreleased tracks for both the Impossibles and Animal Chin. The Impossibles release was titled &quot;Anthology&quot;. It contained the full length and EP, as well as songs recorded before, in between, and after both. Due to royalty-related issues, later pressings removed the cover of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Ben&quot; and Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;. The version without the covers is titled &quot;Anthology &#x27;94 – &#x27;98&quot;.

The Stereo toured the country twice, and response was increasingly favorable, but tensions arose and Rory was released from the band at the end of their fall 1999 tour.

Rory found himself sharing a small one bedroom apartment in Austin with Gabe Hascall, and they reconnected as songwriters. They recorded acoustic demos (some of which would later evolve into Slowreader songs) and decided they&#x27;d try to reunite the Impossibles. Both Craig and Pat jumped at the idea, even though Craig was playing bass and writing songs in the band Cruiserweight at the time.

===Reunion: 2000–2002===
They began practicing and writing songs together and recorded the album &quot;Return&quot;. Their new material retained the quiet/loud dynamic, heavy choruses, and vocal interplay that marked their previous releases, while ditching the ska guitar parts they felt they had grown out of. They played a sold-out reunion show at Emo&#x27;s in March 2000 and toured the country in support of the new release.

In 2001, while recording songs for an EP, tensions with drummer Pat Elliott began to mount, and eventually he was asked to leave the band. While they continued to tour and support the new EP, they were increasingly unhappy with the fans&#x27; reaction to their new material and the complaints over their growing aversion to ska. Ultimately, they decided to break up again, playing two final shows in one day at Emo&#x27;s in June 2002.

===After the second break-up: 2002–present===
Rory Phillips and Gabe Hascall subsequently put their focus back towards the acoustic songwriting that had helped them reconnect, and they recorded and toured as Slowreader.

During this time Rory more seriously put his focus on producing and recording other bands. He recorded, produced, and co-wrote demo songs with Dan Keyes of Recover under the name American Express, which would later come to be known as Young Love.

His latest project is The Artificial Heart, which evolved from earlier projects the20goto10 and Nineteen Ninety Now and features songs written for both.

Gabe had started a band called the Record Heat in 2003 and moved to California to pursue it, but moved back to Austin and began playing and recording as a solo performer. He currently lives in Austin and has released two records via Austin Town Hall Records. 

Craig Tweedy currently plays with Rory in The Artificial Heart.

Beginning in early 2010, an internet presence was revived consisting of a Twitter account and an official Facebook fanpage. This, combined with speculation of album reissues through Paper + Plastick, had fueled rumors of some kind of reunion, which was ultimately announced on 2/13/12.

Original drummer Pat Elliott died at age 34 on May 8, 2015, due to complications of kidney failure.

===Second reunion: 2012===
On June 9, 2012, ten years and one week after their last show, The Impossibles played a reunion at the Mohawk in Austin, TX. Due to selling out the reunion show in hours, the Impossibles added a second show on June 10, 2012. The band was joined onstage by former fill-in drummer, Santiago &quot;Jimmy&quot; Vela III for the concerts. On February 2, 2013, the band released a live video recording of one of the reunion performances, titled &quot;Long Way From/Long Time Since (Live)&quot; online via Priorities Intact Records. In July 2013 Fun Fun Fun Fest announced that The Impossibles would be a performing at the festival. On August 1, 2013, the band hinted at the possibility of new recordings and in October 2013 they released a 7&quot; titled &quot;Come Back B/W the Position&quot; on Priorities Intact Records. Both songs feature drummer Mark Toohey.

<doc id="1182518" wikidata="Q53114" url="?curid=1182518" title="Hodierna of Jerusalem">
<text>Hodierna of Jerusalem ( 1116 – 1162) was the countess of Tripoli through her marriage to Raymond II of Tripoli. She ruled the County of Tripoli as regent during the minority of their son Raymond III from 1152 until 1155.

Hodierna was the daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and sister of Queen Melisende. She may have been betrothed to Count Raymond II of Tripoli already as a child, but did not marry him until the 1130s. Hodierna was a politically active countess and is alleged to have played a part in the disposing of her husband&#x27;s cousin and rival Bertrand. Her marriage was unhappy because of her husband&#x27;s jealousy. Hodierna had just left Raymond when he was assassinated in 1152, and she returned to Tripoli to take charge of government in their son&#x27;s name. After her son assumed power, Hodierna assisted her sister Queen Melisende until the latter&#x27;s death in 1161. Hodierna died shortly after.

Countess Hodierna remains little known compared to her sisters Queen Melisende and Princess Alice. She has, however, been identified as the &quot;princesse lointaine&quot; in several troubadour poems and tales and of the works of art inspired them.

==Early life==
Hodierna was born 1115-17. She was the third daughter of Baldwin of Bourcq, a Frankish nobleman, and Morphia of Melitene, an Armenian noblewoman. Hodierna and her older sisters, Melisende and Alice, were born while their father was the count of Edessa. The County of Edessa was, along with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch, and the County of Tripoli, one of the states established by the Franks, who defeated the Muslims of the Levant in the First Crusade.

In 1118 Baldwin was elected king of Jerusalem. The following year he installed his cousin Joscelin of Courtenay as the new count of Edessa and brought his family to Jerusalem. Hodierna gained another sister, Ioveta, after her parents were crowned king and queen in 1119. 

In 1122 Count Pons of Tripoli rebelled against King Baldwin. Historian Kevin Lewis considers it &quot;very possible&quot; that Hodierna&#x27;s betrothal to Raymond was first brought in the aftermath of this dispute up as a way to reconcile the two ruling families. Queen Morphia died probably in 1126 or 1127. King Baldwin no longer expected to have a son and started providing for his daughters and settling his succession. Melisende, the eldest daughter, was to be his heir; in 1129 she was married to Count Fulk V of Anjou. Alice, the second eldest, was married to Prince Bohemond II of Antioch in 1126. Lewis and Hans E. Mayer believe that Hodierna may have been betrothed to Raymond, son of Count Pons of Tripoli, already at this time. Ioveta, the youngest, was sent to the Convent of Saint Anne. Hodierna&#x27;s father died in 1131, and was succeeded by Melisende and Fulk.

==Consort==
===Marriage===

Count Pons was defeated by Muslims and killed in 1137. He was succeeded by his son, Raymond II. Lewis presumes that Hodierna&#x27;s marriage to Raymond was delayed until 1132 because she was far too young in 1127. Historian Malcolm Barber believes that the union was the result of Queen Melisende&#x27;s effort to provide for Hodierna and to link the ruling houses of all the crusader states. Hodierna, already called the countess of Tripoli but not accompanied by her husband, attended the court of King Fulk and Queen Melisende in Acre in December 1138. Hodierna and Raymond II had their first child, Raymond III, in 1140.

===Rival claims===
In 1144 the County of Edessa was conquered by Muslim leader Imad al-Din Zengi, which in 1148 led to the Second Crusade. Raymond&#x27;s granduncle Count Alfonso Jordan of Toulouse arrived in the Levant with the crusade. Historian Jean Richard proposes that Alfonso intended to claim Tripoli. He died suddenly soon after his arrival; poisoning was widely suspected. An anonymous monk from France wrote that Alfonso was poisoned on the orders of Queen Melisende, who allegedly wished to safeguard Raymond and Hodierna&#x27;s position in Tripoli. Lewis believes that Alfonso died of natural causes.

Alfonso&#x27;s illegitimate son Bertrand stayed in the Levant after the crusade. He entered the County of Tripoli and seized the fortress of Urayma; contemporary Arabs thought this to be the first step to seizing the county. Raymond could not dislodge his cousin, and enlisted the help of Nur al-Din Zengi and Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, who captured Urayma and Bertrand within it. Raymond&#x27;s alliance with Muslims outraged other Franks. The anonymous monk accused Melisende of complicity. Historians have traditionally read the monk&#x27;s account as saying that Bertrand was captured with his sister, but Lewis interprets it as saying that Melisende had an accomplice, her sister Hodierna, whose motive was to preserve her husband&#x27;s domain, and accepts it as true.

===Marital discord===
According to legend the Provençal troubadour Jaufre Rudel fell in love with Hodierna, whom he had never seen; he fell ill while sailing to Tripoli and died in her arms soon after his arrival. Lewis believes that Rudel might have arrived with the Second Crusade. According to a &quot;fanciful Occitan tale&quot;, as Lewis describes it, Hodierna had Rudel buried in the house of the Knights Templar in Tripoli. Lewis observes that this detail might hint that Hodierna was the one who brought the Templars into Tripoli. 

By 1152 Hodierna and Raymond&#x27;s marriage was in a crisis. Lewis speculates that Raymond may have envied her higher social status. According to the legend involving Rudel, pilgrims returning from the Levant spread stories of Hodierna&#x27;s beauty in Europe, and there were rumours that her daughter Melisende of Tripoli was born from an extramarital love affair, which Lewis believes may have led to Raymond&#x27;s jealousy. Lewis speculates that, in the light of Hodierna&#x27;s sister Melisende struggle for power with her husband, Fulk, and Hodierna&#x27;s own alleged initiative in disposing of Bertrand of Toulouse, Raymond may have feared that Hodierna might threaten his authority; or that, at the time of growing tensions between Latin Christians and native Christians, Hodierna&#x27;s mixed Latin-Armenian heritage posed a concern to Raymond.

In 1152 Hodierna&#x27;s nephew King Baldwin III of Jerusalem, son of Queen Melisende, summoned a meeting of the crusader states&#x27; nobility in Tripoli. His main objective was to force his cousin Princess Constance of Antioch to choose a husband. Hodierna and Melisende, Constance&#x27;s aunts, also attended, but all attempts failed. Melisende had arrived not just to see Constance, however, but also to mediate between Hodierna and Raymond. She was not successful, and decided to take Hodierna back to Jerusalem. Barber writes that Raymond accompanied the queen and the countess on a part of their journey south from Tripoli, while Lewis writes that he instead accompanied the princess on her way back to Antioch. Either way, Raymond was ambushed and killed by Assassins upon his return to Tripoli. King Baldwin immediately recalled his mother and aunt to Tripoli to attend the count&#x27;s funeral, after which all the nobles of the county paid homage to the countess, her son, and her daughter on the king&#x27;s orders.

==Widowhood==
Raymond III was underage when the assassination of his father made him count. Richard sees no proof of Hodierna assuming rule as regent in William&#x27;s account, whereas Lewis believes that Hodierna was given charge because the nobility took an oath to her and her minor children. Lewis believes that she was a good fit because she had demonstrated initiative and political skill, and because she was loyal to her Jerusalemite family. The appointment of Hodierna contravened Raymond II&#x27;s instruction that the county should be ruled by the &quot;master of the county&quot;, an otherwise unknown functionary, if it should pass to a minor. Soon after Raymond II&#x27;s death, Raymond III was sent to live at the court of his cousin Baldwin III. Hodierna administered the county probably until 1155, when her son reached the age of majority upon his fifteenth birthday. Historian Bernard Hamilton suggests that it was Hodierna who initiated the establishment of Belmont, the first Cistercian monastery in the crusader states. In 1157 Queen Melisende, her stepdaughter Countess Sibylla of Flanders, and Countess Hodierna intervened, against the Gregorian laws, to secure the election of the queen&#x27;s chaplain Amalric of Nesle as the new Latin patriarch of Jerusalem.

In 1160 the widowed Emperor Manuel I Komnenos asked King Baldwin to select a new wife for the emperor among the noblewomen of the crusader states. The emperor expressed particular interest in Baldwin&#x27;s cousins Melisende of Tripoli and Maria of Antioch. Baldwin chose Melisende, and Manuel accepted. Hodierna and her sister Queen Melisende spent a year preparing the girl&#x27;s dowry at a great expense to the royal treasury. In July 1161 Countess Hodierna and her children arrived in Nazareth. Lewis and Richard agree that they came to discuss with Baldwin the plans for the imminent marriage of Hodierna&#x27;s daughter, to whom they referred to in a charter as &quot;the future empress of the throne of Constantinople&quot;. Throughout 1161 Emperor Manuel prevaricated, however, and when pressed by Baldwin in mid-1162 finally revealed that he was not going to marry Melisende. The family were shocked and humiliated, and soon learned that the emperor had secretly negotiated a marriage with Maria of Antioch instead.

Queen Melisende had a stroke in 1161. Countess Hodierna and her surviving sister, Abbess Ioveta, cared for the queen until her death on 11 September. Hodierna herself died on 21 December. The year and cause of her death are not recorded. She last appears in the written record in 1161.

==Legacy==

Lewis believes that Archbishop William of Tyre refrained from inviting any criticism of Hodierna because of his support for her son in the politics of Jerusalem. Hence, he argues, he had motive to supress information about her involvement, if any, in the capture of Bertrand of Toulouse by the Muslims. The career of Raymond III, in Lewis&#x27;s opinion, followed the &quot;somewhat
disappointing example set by his father rather than the more promising precedent of his mother&quot;, though she had a greater influence on Raymond III.

Lewis concludes that Hodierna has been overlooked by historians in favor of her &quot;more famous and better documented&quot; older sisters, Melisende and Alice, despite being just as willing to engage in politics. Whereas most countesses of Tripoli are comparatively undistinguished figures, Lewis finds that Hodierna &quot;eclipsed her husband&quot;, but was in the posterity reduced to being the &quot;princesse lointaine&quot;, a &quot;beautiful yet voiceless target of a distant stranger&#x27;s affections&quot;. Rudel&#x27;s obsession with Hodierna remained a topic of popular interest into the modern age: in the 19th-century Edmond Rostand made it the subject of his operetta &quot;La Princesse lointaine&quot;, and in the 20th century P. G. Wodehouse mentioned it in a novella. Thus, Lewis notes, the legacy of Tripoli under Raymond II and Hodierna were not political or military achievements but &quot;lustful, exotic and even farcical fantasies&quot;.

<doc id="1182519" wikidata="Q234226" url="?curid=1182519" title="Dominique Swain">
<text>Dominique Swain (born August 12, 1980) is an American actress. She first came to attention as the title character in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s 1997 adaptation of &quot;Lolita&quot;, alongside a supporting role in John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Face/Off&quot; that same year. She worked predominantly in independent cinema throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, with credits including &quot;Girl&quot; (1998), &quot;Intern&quot; (2000), &quot;Tart&quot; (2001), and &quot;Pumpkin&quot; (2002). Subsequent credits include &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; (2010), and a succession of films in the action, thriller, and horror genres.

== Early life ==
Swain attended Malibu High School in Malibu, California. Her parents separated when she was 15. She has three siblings, including actress Chelse Swain.

== Career ==
=== 1997–1999: Film debut and critical acclaim ===
In 1995, at the age of 15, Swain was chosen out of 2,500 girls to play the title role of Dolores &quot;Lolita&quot; Haze in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s controversial screen adaptation of the 1955 novel, &quot;Lolita&quot;. Released in 1997, the film earned positive reviews from critics, with &quot;New York Magazine&quot; calling it &quot;superior&quot; to the Stanley Kubrick version from 1962, and Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that Swain&#x27;s performance was &quot;extraordinary,&quot; adding:

That same year, Swain appeared as John Travolta&#x27;s rebellious teenage daughter, Jamie, in John Woo&#x27;s commercially successful action thriller &quot;Face/Off&quot;, with a positive review from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; highlighting her chemistry with Travolta. Next, she headlined the 1998 drama &quot;Girl&quot;, in which she portrayed a high-schooler determined to lose her virginity. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, critic David Stratton called it a &quot;well-cast, modestly effective pic&quot; with &quot;a bright, intelligent performance&quot; by Swain.

Speaking of finding it hard to secure roles in the wake of &quot;Lolita&quot;, a matter she attributed to typecasting, Swain later commented, &quot;I turned down stuff specifically because of nudity, because it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of class to yank your clothes off ... I had a body double in &quot;Lolita&quot; [so] I think the goal was &#x27;Let&#x27;s see what she &quot;really&quot; looks like.&#x27; They were sending me scripts with no substance to them.&quot;

=== 2000–2006: Independent films ===

Swain had prominent roles in various independent films throughout the early 2000s—&quot;The Smokers&quot;, &quot;Intern&quot;, &quot;Pumpkin&quot;, &quot;New Best Friend&quot;—and worked on three occasions with Brad Renfro—&quot;Happy Campers&quot;, &quot;Tart&quot;, &quot;The Job&quot;—prior to his death. In 2006, she starred as aspiring dancer Lori Gunderson in &quot;Totally Awesome&quot;, a parody of 1980s teen movies. Next, she played the supporting role of Susan Hartunian in &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;, the closing night film at that year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival. A crime drama based on the murder of Nicholas Markowitz, Swain&#x27;s character was inspired by Natasha Adams-Young, a key figure in the real case who was granted legal immunity in exchange for her testimony in court.

=== 2007–present: Genre films and television work ===

In 2007, Swain headlined the supernatural horror film &quot;Dead Mary&quot;, which &quot;Fangoria&quot; felt was successful in setting itself apart from other entries in the genre. She received praise for her performance in the 2010 thriller &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;, which Kevin Thomas described as a &quot;stylish, shimmering neo-noir&quot; in his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. 

Following lead roles in the straight-to-video action films &quot;The Girl from the Naked Eye&quot;, &quot;Nazis at the Center of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Skin Traffik&quot;, and &quot;Sharkansas Women&#x27;s Prison Massacre&quot;, Swain starred in the 2016 thriller &quot;The Wrong Roommate&quot;; her first of several appearances in the &quot;Wrong...&quot; series, an anthological group of Lifetime television films.

== Campaigning ==
In 2001, at the age of 21, Swain posed nude for PETA&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Naked than Wear Fur&quot; campaign.

<text>Andrea A. diSessa (born June 3, 1947) is an education researcher and author of the book &quot;Turtle Geometry&quot; about Logo. He has also written highly cited research papers on the epistemology of physics, educational experimentation, and constructivist analysis of knowledge. He also created, with Hal Abelson, the Boxer Programming Environment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Personal history==
DiSessa received an A.B. in physics from Princeton University in 1969 and a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975. He was an invited fellow in residence at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences twice, once from 1997-1998 and again from 2007-2008. He is currently Evelyn Lois Corey Professor of Education at the University of California, Berkeley and has been a member of the National Academy for Education since 1995.

Some of his notable work in Education research focuses on the concept of material intelligence and computational literacy, and ontological innovations and the role of theory in design based research.

==Material intelligence==
Material Intelligence can be thought of as a subset of distributed cognition, where it refers to the new knowledge that furthers human intelligence and skills by interaction with the computer, and existing computer literacy, in a social environment. It can also be the ability of tools in general, and computers in specific, to increase the intelligence and skills of human mind. It was coined by Andrea DiSessa in his book &quot;Changing Minds: Computers,&quot; &quot;Learning and Literacy&quot;. He uses the terms computational literacy, material literacy, and material intelligence interchangeably. Conceptually, material intelligence is influenced by constructionism and distributed cognition theory. This concept is similar to constructionism because user makes sense of the world around them using a tool, and the interaction with this tool is helpful in shaping the understanding of the world. It is similar to distributed cognition because it focuses on &quot;social and material setting of cognitive activity, so that culture, context and history can be linked with the core concepts of cognition.&quot;

Material intelligence has to be dependent on the material (the tool, or the computer), but it also has to be social. He says that &quot;Material intelligence does not reside in either the mind or the materials alone. Indeed, the coupling of external and internal activity is intricate and critical&quot;. Hatch &amp; Gardner elaborated on the social aspect of human intelligence in their chapter on Distributed Cognitions. They stated that learning is social and happens whenever humans interact with one another, even though the manner in which learning happens may differ based on 1) cultural forces, 2) local forces, and 3) personal forces, with cultural forces being the least motivating force, and personal forces being the most motivating force. This is relevant because instances of material intelligence happen at an individual level, which are shaped by personal experiences, and then they spread outwards to influence the culture.

=== Examples of material intelligence ===
A typical example of material intelligence is calculus. When Newton discovered Calculus, it was a form of material intelligence because he used the tool (literacy and scientific abilities) to further his knowledge. However, this did not create any significant effects on general human intelligence at that time, because it was a hard notion to understand. Leibniz introduced the simpler notations of Calculus, thereby making it accessible to general people, and hence, making it a permanent member of Math curricula around the world. Material intelligence can become as pervasive as traditional literacy only when all the complex social forces of innovation, adoption and interdependence support it, even if it originated with an individual or a small group of people.

In today&#x27;s world, the Google search engine can be thought of as an example of material intelligence. When it was invented in 1998, it was knowledge accessible only to the &quot;technological elite&quot;, but it is now a common tool that ordinary people use to build on their intelligence or knowledge at the most basic level. This is to emphasize the point that Google had the advantages that other search engines didn&#x27;t and the complex social forces of innovation, adoption and interdependence supported it. This computer based technology is a tool that is enhancing the intelligence of general people enabling them to do more interesting things with their new knowledge.

Although tempting to think that artificial and material intelligence are similar because of their relation to computers and computational thinking, they are two very different concepts. It is distinct from Artificial Intelligence (AI) as AI places either existing human knowledge, or some enhanced version of it, into a machine; whereas material intelligence is new knowledge that furthers human intelligence and skills by interaction with the computer, and existing computer literacies, in a social environment.

<doc id="1182550" wikidata="Q12360" url="?curid=1182550" title="Bottle opener">
<text>A bottle opener is a device that enables the removal of metal bottle caps from glass bottles. More generally, it might be thought to include corkscrews used to remove cork or plastic stoppers from wine bottles.

A metal bottle cap is affixed to the rim of the neck of a bottle by being pleated or ruffled around the rim. A bottle opener is a specialized lever inserted beneath the pleated metalwork, which uses a point on the bottle cap as a on which to .

==Varieties==
There are several distinct designs of such bottle openers. Wall mounted openers are typically found behind bars in pubs, whilst hand-tool bottle openers tend to be found and used in domestic environments. The functional elements of bottle openers (a tooth or lip to catch the underside of the cap, a fulcrum across which to exert the force that will remove the cap, and usually a lever for mechanical advantage) tend to be consistent, although they can vary in design and aesthetics.


===Crown cork opener===

Invented at the same time as the crown cork, it is the original bottle opener. But as well as being portable it also comes as a fixed device to be attached to vertical surfaces, often with a tray to catch the bottle tops. It does not open wine bottles.

A simple opener is a piece of metal with a rectangular or rounded opening in one end and a solid handle large enough to be gripped between the thumb and forefingers on the other. The opening contains a lip that is placed under the edge of the bottle top, pulling it off when upward force is applied to the handle end of the opener.

===Speed opener (&#x27;bar blade&#x27;)===

The speed opener is a flat blade of steel approximately 4 cm wide and 16 cm long with a thumb hole at one end and a letterbox cut at the other to remove the crown seals from a bottle. They go under the names &#x27;speed opener&#x27;, &#x27;popper&#x27;, &#x27;mamba&#x27;, &#x27;bar key&#x27;, and most popularly &#x27;bar blade&#x27;. The thumb hole may be used to pull bottles out of ice, by placing the hole over the neck of the bottle, then lifting it. The speed opener is widely used by professional bartenders in Canada, the United States, and the UK. Carried in the pocket or against the body or on a zip string, it is both convenient and fast for the modern bartender. It is advantageous in that it is easy to open several bottles in rapid succession, and with more flair than other types of bottle opener. Consequently, &#x27;bar blading&#x27; is often part of bar flair routines.

===Wall-mounted===

Works the same as the lever variation, except that it is attached to the wall, to allow for simpler bottle-opening, which can be done with one hand. The bottle cap can fall into a bottle cap catcher mounted below the opener, or it can be retrieved after removal from the bottle. 
A variant to this are similar types of openers mounted on older vending machines.

===Multi-opener===
Also known as a beverage opener, these usually includes a bottle opener of the simple bottle opener style but includes various other openers such as for plastic bottles or metal beverage cans.
== Technique ==
Under most use, a bottle opener functions as a second-class lever: the fulcrum is the far end of the bottle opener, placed on the top of the crown, with the output at the near end of the bottle opener, on the crown edge, &quot;between&quot; the fulcrum and the hand: in these cases, one pushes &quot;up&quot; on the lever.

However, one may instead use it as a first-class lever, by placing the near end on the top of the crown, and the far end under the crown edge, then pushing &quot;down&quot; on the lever (thus the output is on the &quot;opposite side&quot; of the fulcrum from the hand). This is particularly used with bar blades, which form an obtuse angle. Mechanically, this is a marginally less effective lever, as the effort arm is shorter, but the action of pushing down is marginally anatomically easier.

While most lever-type bottle openers can be used in either configuration, the designed use can be determined if one of the edges is curved, in which case this edge is designed to sit in the middle of the crown, as the curve concentrates pressure, deforming the crown, and a curved edge does not connect with as much of the crown edge, hence being suboptimal and slipping more frequently if used to connect with the crown edge. This difference can be seen in comparing the traditional opener and contemporary bar blade at right.

== Injuries ==
New Zealand has had in average 40 injuries recorded by the Accident Compensation Corporation per year due to injuries while opening a beer bottle that required to remove a metal lid. Two ophthalmologists Cam Loveridge-Easther and Sacha Moore wrote a letter recommending for warnings to be put on bottles.

<text>Class C is a class of airspace in the United States which follows International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) air space designation. Class C airspace areas are designed to improve aviation safety by reducing the risk of mid-air collisions in the terminal area and enhance the management of air traffic operations therein. Aircraft operating in these airspace areas are subject to certain operating rules and equipment requirements.

Class C airspace protects the approach and departure paths from aircraft not under air traffic control. All aircraft inside Class C airspace are subject to air traffic control. Traffic operating under VFR must be in communication with a controller before entering the airspace. The airspace is similar to Class B&#x27;s &quot;upside-down wedding cake&quot;, but much smaller and simpler. The innermost ring with a radius of typically extends from the surface area around the airport to AGL (above ground level; charted in MSL), and an outer ring, with a radius of that typically surrounds the inner ring and extends from a floor at AGL, (also charted in MSL), to the ceiling at AGL, (again charted in MSL). These dimensions are sometimes highly customized when deemed necessary to accommodate IFR traffic patterns and other surrounding airspace design issues such as the overlapping or close proximities to other classes of airspace.

As of January 2023, there are 122 Class C airports in the United States (counting NAS Whiting Field as 2 different airports).

The following list of Class C airports is sorted by state/territory and IATA Airport Code/ICAO Airport Code.

<text>The Rolls-Royce RB.41 Nene is a 1940s British centrifugal compressor turbojet engine. The Nene was a complete redesign, rather than a scaled-up Rolls-Royce Derwent, with a design target of , making it the most powerful engine of its era. First run in 1944, it was Rolls-Royce&#x27;s third jet engine to enter production, and first ran less than 6 months from the start of design. It was named after the River Nene in keeping with the company&#x27;s tradition of naming its jet engines after rivers.

The design saw relatively little use in British aircraft designs, being passed over in favour of the axial-flow Avon that followed it. Its only widespread use in the UK was in the Hawker Sea Hawk and the Supermarine Attacker. In the US it was built under licence as the Pratt &amp; Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther. Its most widespread use was in the form of the Klimov VK-1, a reverse-engineered, modified and enlarged version which produced around of thrust, and powered the Russian built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, a highly successful fighter aircraft which was produced in vast numbers.

An uprated version of the Nene was produced as the Rolls-Royce Tay.

==Design and development==
The Nene was designed as a result of a June 1944 visit to the US by Stanley Hooker. He discovered that General Electric already had two engine types running, an axial and a centrifugal, of thrust. He was determined to produce a higher thrust engine and subsequently obtained a Ministry of Aircraft Production contract for an engine of 4,200 lbf (19 kN) thrust with the understanding that would be the design target. Hooker, Adrian Lombard, Pearson and Morley designed a new engine, the B.41 later called the Nene, rather than scaling up the Derwent. 

The double-sided impeller was in diameter, compared to for the Derwent I, to produce an airflow of , while the overall diameter of the engine was . A scaled up Derwent of the same thrust would have had a diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle&#x27;s Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, an attempt was made to start the engine. To the frustration of everyone with a vested interest in it starting the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time. On a subsequent attempt, Denis Drew, who had come from Lucas, the combustion specialists, and took a wide interest in engine development problems, removed one of the igniters and instead used the flame from an oxy-acetylene torch to ignite the fuel in the combustion chamber.

The igniter had to be close enough to the fuel spray to ignite it when starting, but not overheat when subjected to the continuous flame temperature when the engine was running. The larger diameter of the Nene combustion chambers found this to be a problem, and the first-run needed to ignite with a flame rather than the spark energy that was considered sufficient at that time. The Nene was subsequently fitted with two torch, or flame, igniters which had a fuel spray next to an igniter. The flame would project into the main combustor fuel spray. Torch igniters were superseded by surface discharge igniter plugs with a considerably greater energy release rate than a flame.

The engine was run up to just over , and a cheer went up around the assembled personnel. However the engine was running hotter than expected and would not reach 5,000 lb, as it was built, without overheating the turbine. Pearson, the performance engineer, insisted that no more running be done without fitting the guide vanes that were available for the impeller intake. Upon Hooker&#x27;s arrival next morning, and informed that the inlet vanes had been fitted during the night, Hooker was overjoyed to see the thrust gauge needle registering at the same temperature that had only given 4,000 lb the previous night, making the B.41 the highest thrust jet engine in the world. Weight was around .

Inlet guide vanes had been in use in Whittle engines for some time. They improve the overall performance of the engine significantly by &quot;helping the air round the corner&quot;. However they were made from thin sheet metal and often broke damaging the engine. For Hooker they were a worrying mechanical problem which he did not want so they were not fitted when the Derwent entered service, although the turbine had to run 90 degC hotter to give the take-off thrust of 2,000 lb. He was still concerned with the durability of the vanes so the first Nene was initially built without them.

The Nene was based on the &quot;straight-through&quot; version of the basic Whittle-style layout, with the flow going directly through the engine from front to rear, as opposed to a &quot;reverse-flow&quot; type, which reverses the direction of air flow through the combustor section so that the turbine stage can be mounted within the combustor section; this allows for a more compact engine, but increases the combustor pressure losses which has an adverse effect on engine performance. Less thrust is generated with the same fuel flow. It was during the design of the Nene that Rolls decided to give their engines numbers as well as names, with the Welland and Derwent keeping their original Rover models, B/23 and B/26. It was later decided that these model designations looked too much like RAF bomber designations (i.e. &quot;&quot;English Electric Canberra B.Mk 2&quot; would often be shortened to &quot;Canberra B.2&quot;&quot;), and &quot;R&quot; was added to the front, the &quot;R&quot; signifying &quot;Rolls&quot; and the original Rover &quot;B&quot; signifying Barnoldswick. This RB designation scheme continued into the late 20th Century, with turbofan designs such as the RB.199, RB.203 and RB.211; the most recent family of Rolls-Royce turbofans (a development of the RB.211) goes under the simple designation &quot;Rolls-Royce Trent&quot;, with variants given their own designator number or letter series (i.e. Trent 500, Trent 900, Trent 1000, Trent XWB, etc.).
Early airborne tests of the Nene were undertaken in an Avro Lancastrian operated by Rolls-Royce from their Hucknall airfield. The two outboard Rolls-Royce Merlins were replaced by the jet engine. The Nene&#x27;s first flight however was in a modified Lockheed XP-80 Shooting Star.

After seeing the Nene running, at an after work drink at the Swan &amp; Royal Hotel, Clitheroe, and hearing the complaints about a lack of any official application for the engine, someone - thought to be Whittle - suggested that the Nene be scaled-down to fit a Meteor nacelle. J.P. Herriot or Lombard did the calculation on a tablecloth and announced a thrust of . At this time they were attempting to increase the Derwent&#x27;s thrust from , and the idea seemed &quot;too good to be true&quot;. On hearing this, Hooker did a quick calculation and announced, &quot;We&#x27;ve got a 600-mph [] Meteor&quot;.

Drawings for the 0.855 scale Nene, now known as the Derwent V, were started on 1 January 1945 and on 7 June the engine began a 100-hour test at , soon reaching . Weight was . By 1946 thrust had been increased to using Nimonic 90 turbine blades.

The development of the Nene was continued with this scaled-down version, the Derwent V having no direct relationship to the earlier Derwent series. On 7 November 1945, the first official air speed record by a jet aircraft was set by a Meteor F.3 of 606 miles per hour (975 km/h) powered by the scaled-down Nene.

==Service use==
The Nene doubled the thrust of the earlier generation engines, with early versions providing about 5,000 lbf (22.2 kN), but remained generally similar in most ways. This should have suggested that it would be widely used in various designs, but the Gloster Meteor proved so successful with its Derwents that the Air Ministry felt there was no pressing need to improve upon it. Instead a series of much more capable designs using the Rolls-Royce Avon were studied, and the Nene generally languished.

A total of twenty-five Nenes were sold to the Soviet Union as a gesture of goodwill - with reservation to not use for military purposes - with the agreement of Stafford Cripps. Rolls-Royce were given permission in September 1946 to sell 10 Nene engines to the USSR, and in March 1947 to sell a further 15. The price was fixed under a commercial contract. A total of 55 jet engines were sold to the Soviets in 1947. Seventeen Soviet engineers trained at the Rolls-Royce factory in Derby in 1947 to maintain and repair the engine. The Soviets reneged on the promise to not use it for military purposes, and reverse engineered the Nene to develop the Klimov RD-45, and a larger version, the Klimov VK-1, which soon appeared in various Soviet fighters including Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15.

Pratt &amp; Whitney acquired a licence to produce the Nene as the Pratt &amp; Whitney J42, and it powered the Grumman F9F Panther which first flew in November 1947.

The Nene was used to power the first civil jet aircraft, the Nene Viking, a modified Vickers Viking, the single example of which first flew on 6 April 1948 from Wisley Airfield.

It was briefly made under licence in Australia for use in the RAAF de Havilland Vampire fighters. It was also built by Orenda in Canada for use in 656 Canadair CT-133 Silver Star aircraft from 1952.

Hispano-Suiza in France built the Nene under licence as the Hispano-Suiza Nene, with limited production before concentrating on the larger Rolls-Royce Tay/Hispano-Suiza Verdon.

<text>Human habitation in the Sierra Nevada region of California reaches back 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. Historically attested Native American populations, such as the Sierra Miwok, Mono and Paiute, belong to the Uto-Aztecan and Utian phyla. In the mid-19th century, a band of Native Americans called the Ahwahnechee lived in Yosemite Valley. The California Gold Rush greatly increased the number of non-indigenous people in the region. Tensions between Native Americans and white settlers escalated into the Mariposa War. As part of this conflict, settler James Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. The California state military forces burned the tribe&#x27;s villages, destroyed their food stores, killed the chief&#x27;s sons, and forced the tribe out of Yosemite. Accounts from the Mariposa Battalion, especially from Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, popularized Yosemite Valley as a scenic wonder.

In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees were transferred from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park&#x27;s first white guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable to non-indigenous people, and access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Indigenous people continued to be forced out periodically, while white settlers were paid a total of $60,000 to move out of the valley. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906.

The United States Army had jurisdiction over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by a brief period of civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park&#x27;s administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir when the Raker Act was approved on December 2, 1913. This event was considered a major conservation battle lost, after which John Muir gave up on fighting and died on December 24, 1914. Construction on the O&#x27;Shaughnessey Dam began in 1919 and was completed in 1923. The loss of Hetch Hetchy led to the formation of the National Park Service through the approval of the Organic Act of 1916. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous &quot;Yosemite Firefall&quot;, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park (bear feeding had already been discontinued in 1940).

==Early history==

===Native Americans===
Humans may have lived in the Yosemite area as long as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. 
Habitation of the Yosemite Valley proper can be traced to about 3,000 years ago, when vegetation and game in the region was similar to that present today; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns, deer, and salmon, while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian. Native American groups traveled between these two regions to trade and raid.
Archaeologists divide the pre-European American contact period of the region into three cultural phases. The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000 BCE to 500 CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl and the use of grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans.

Trade between tribes became more widespread during the Mariposa phase, and the diet continued to improve. Paiutes, Miwok, and Monos visited the area to trade; one major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern California.

Paiutes were the primary inhabitants of the Yosemite area and the foothills to the east during the Mariposa and historic phases. The Central Sierra Miwoks lived along the drainage area of the Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers, while the Paiutes inhabited the upper drainage of the Merced and Chowchilla Rivers.

The Paiutes of Yosemite Valley called themselves the Ah-wah-ne-chee, meaning &quot;dwellers in Ahwahnee.&quot; The Ahwahneechees were decimated by a disease in about 1800, and left the valley, although about 200 returned under the leadership of Tenaya, son of an Ahwahneechee chief.

Displaced Native Americans from the Californian coast moved to the Sierra Nevada during the early-to-mid-19th century, bringing with them their knowledge of Spanish food, technology, and clothing. Joining forces with the other tribes in the area, they raided land grant ranchos on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra, where horse meat became a major new food source.

===Exploration by European Americans===
Although there were Spanish missions, &quot;pueblos&quot; (towns), &quot;presidios&quot; (forts), and &quot;ranchos&quot; along the coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada. The first European Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper Jedediah Smith, crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at Ebbetts Pass.
A group of trappers led by mountain man Joseph Reddeford Walker may have seen Yosemite Valley in the autumn of 1833. Walker approached a valley rim as he led his party across the Sierra Nevada, but he did not enter it. A member of the group, Zenas Leonard, wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped &quot;from one lofty precipice to another, until they are exhausted in rain below. Some of these precipices appeared to us to be more than a mile high.&quot; The Walker party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of giant sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.

The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.

The first confirmed sighting of Yosemite Valley by a non-indigenous person occurred on October 18, 1849, by William P. Abrams and a companion. Abrams accurately described some landmarks, but it is uncertain whether he or his companion actually entered the valley. In 1850, one of three brothers, Joseph, William, or Nathan Screech, became the first confirmed non-indigenous person to enter Hetch Hetchy Valley. Joseph Screech returned two years later and spoke with the Native Americans living there, asking them what the name of a grass-covered seed meal was and was told, &quot;hatch hatchy.&quot;

The surveying crew of Allexey W. Von Schmidt conducted the first systematic traverse of any part of the Yosemite area backcountry in 1855, when it extended an approximation of the Mount Diablo Baseline eastward from a point west of the present park boundary, to a point south of Mono Lake. The actual route taken was 5 to 6 miles south of the actual baseline, due to topographic difficulties, including the Tuolumne River canyon at low elevations, and steep mountain slopes higher up. This was the first straight line survey made across the Sierra Nevada From 1879 to 1883 large parts of the western half of the park were surveyed as part of the General Land Office survey. The individual contracted for the largest area, one S. A. Hanson, was later listed among those associated with the Benson Syndicate, and he combined actual with probably fabricated surveys. Topographic surveys performed by Lieutenant Montgomery M. Macomb, under George M Wheeler&#x27;s Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, were completed in the late 1870s and early 1880s.

===Mariposa Wars===

James Savage&#x27;s trading camp on the Merced River, west of Yosemite Valley, was raided by Native Americans in December 1850, after which the raiders retreated into the mountains. 
The camp had been founded because the California Gold Rush had begun in 1849 bringing more than 40,000 gold seekers down the California Trail into northern and central California. This rapid influx of non-native settlers precipitated the California genocide of the indigenous peoples in the State. Before 1849, much of Northern and Central California had been populated by Native Americans and Californios (the descendants of early Spanish settlers). However by 1873, almost 80 percent of California&#x27;s Native American population had been wiped out by conflict and disease, and their historic land seized by settlers from Mexico, South America, Europe, Australia, and China.

In response to miners forcing Native Americans off their historic lands in search for gold, Native Americans launched punitive raids against camps and settlements. Some tribes were pressed into service in mines; others had their villages raided by the army and volunteer militias. Some white settlers also thought it was time to get rid of Native Americans because they commanded too much labor in the mines. In retaliation for the attack on his camp, a month later in January 1851, Jim Savage led a militia in a punitive action against a native village, but after opening fire they were beaten back by indigenous firepower. Savage appealed to John McDougal, governor of California to raise a formation to sort the &quot;Indian problem&quot; out once and for all. The subsequent campaigns led by the Mariposa Battalion in 1851 became known as the Mariposa War. 

Savage led the battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of around 200 Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya. On March 27, 1851, the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point, from where Yosemite Valley&#x27;s main features are visible. Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned, fulfilling the prophecy an old and dying medicine man had given Tenaya many years before. The Ahwahnechee were marched from their tribal lands under armed guards led by Captain John Bowling, to the Fresno River Reservation. With the fighting ended, the battalion was disbanded on July 1, 1851. 

Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed to return to the Yosemite area. Reservation officials consented and allowed Tenaya and some of his band to return to their lands. However, in May 1852 a group of eight armed miners entered Yosemite Valley and were allegedly attacked by Tenaya&#x27;s warriors; two of the miners were killed. In retaliation regular army troops under the direction of Lt. Tredwell Moore shot dead six Ahwahneechee who were in possession of European clothing.

Tenaya&#x27;s band fled the valley and sought refuge with the Mono people, his mother&#x27;s tribe. A year later, in mid-1853, the Ahwahneechee returned to the valley but they betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing horses that the Mono had taken from non-indigenous ranchers. In return, the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee, including Tenaya (Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief). Inter-tribal hostilities eventually subsided and by the mid-1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native Americans still living in the Yosemite area.

===Naming the area===

During the military campaigns of the Mariposa War, members of the Mariposa Battalion had proposed names for the valley while they were camped at Bridalveil Meadow. The company physician who had been attached to Savage&#x27;s unit, Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, suggested &quot;Yo-sem-i-ty&quot;. It was the name that the surrounding Sierra Miwok peoples used, as they feared the tribes in the Yosemite Valley. Savage, who spoke some native dialects, translated this as &quot;full-grown grizzly bear.&quot; The term, which was possibly derived from or confused with the similar &quot;uzumati&quot; or &quot;uhumati&quot;, meaning &quot;grizzly bear,&quot; is the Southern Sierra Miwok word &quot;Yohhe&#x27;meti&quot;, meaning &quot;they are killers.&quot; Bunnell named many other local topographic features on the same trip.

Bunnell drafted an article about the trip, but destroyed it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his 1,500- foot (460 m) height estimate for the valley&#x27;s walls in half; the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised. The first published account of Yosemite Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854, issue of the &quot;Mariposa Chronicle&quot;, establishing the modern spelling of &quot;Yosemite&quot;. Bunnell described his awestruck impressions of the valley in his book, &quot;The Discovery of the Yosemite&quot;, published in 1892.
===Artists, photographers, and the first tourists===
Forty-eight Non-Indian people visited Yosemite Valley in 1855, including San Francisco writer James Mason Hutchings and artist Thomas Ayres. Hutchings wrote an article about his experience that was published in the July 12, 1855, issue of the &quot;Mariposa Gazette&quot; and Ayres&#x27; sketch of Yosemite Falls was published in late 1855; four of his drawings were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of &quot;Hutchings&#x27; Illustrated California Magazine&quot;. The article and illustrations created tourist interest in Yosemite and eventually led to its protection.

Ayres returned in 1856 and visited Tuolumne Meadows in the area&#x27;s high country. His highly detailed angularly exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were distributed nationally and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City.

Hutchings took photographer Charles Leander Weed to Yosemite Valley in 1859; Weed took the first photographs of the valley&#x27;s features, which were presented to the public in a September exhibition held in San Francisco. Hutchings published four installments of &quot;The Great Yo-semite Valley&quot; from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine and re-published a collection of these articles in his &quot;Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California&quot;, which remained in print into the 1870s.
Carleton Watkins exhibited his Yosemite views at the 1867 Paris International Exposition.

Photographer Ansel Adams made his first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his photographs of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.

Milton and Houston Mann opened a toll road to Yosemite Valley in 1856, up the South Fork of the Merced River. They charged the then considerable sum of two dollars per person until the road was bought by Mariposa County, after which it became free.

In 1856, settler Galen Clark discovered the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia at Wawona, an indigenous encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park. Clark completed a bridge over the South Fork of the Merced River in 1857 at Wawona for traffic headed toward Yosemite Valley and provided a way station for travelers on the road the Mann brothers built to the valley.

Simple lodgings, later called the Lower Hotel, were completed soon afterward; the Upper Hotel, later renamed Hutchings House and eventually known as Cedar Cottage, was opened in 1859. In 1876, the more substantial Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby grove of big trees and those on their way to Yosemite Valley. Aaron Harris opened the first campground business in Yosemite in 1876.

==State grant==

===Forming the state grant===
Visitation and interest in Yosemite continued to grow through the American Civil War. Unitarian minister Thomas Starr King visited the valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that settlement and commercial activity were having on the area. Six travel letters by Starr King were published in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; in 1860 and 1861; Starr King became the first person with a nationally recognized voice to call for a public park at Yosemite. Oliver Wendell Holmes and John Greenleaf Whittier read and commented on Starr King&#x27;s letters and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted was prompted by the warnings to visit the Yosemite area in 1863.

Pressure from Starr King and Olmsted, photographs by Carleton Watkins, and geological data from the 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take action. Senator John Conness of California introduced a park bill in 1864 to the United States Senate to cede Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees to California.

The bill easily passed both houses of the United States Congress, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864. The Yosemite Grant, as it was called, was given to California as a state park for &quot;public use, resort and recreation&quot;. A board of commissioners, with Frederick Law Olmsted as chairman, was formed in September 1864 to govern the grant, but it did not meet until 1866.

===Managing the state grant===
The commission appointed Galen Clark as the grant&#x27;s first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict homesteaders. Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley would meet the same fate as Niagara Falls, which at that time was a tourist trap with tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint.
Hutchings and a small group of settlers sought legal homesteading rights on of the valley floor. The issue was not settled until 1874 when the land holdings of Hutchings and three others were invalidated and the state legislature appropriated $60,000 ($ as of 2025) to compensate the settlers, of which Hutchings received $20,000.

Conditions in Yosemite Valley and access to the park steadily improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain a swamp behind it. Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.

The long horseback ride from Merced remained a deterrent to tourists. Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Wawona Road (July 1875). A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883, which roughly followed the Mono Trail to Tuolumne Meadows.

Clark and the sitting commissioners were removed from office by the California Legislature in 1880, and Hutchings became the new guardian. Hutchings in turn was replaced as guardian, in 1884, by W. E. Dennison. Clark was reappointed as guardian in 1889 and retired in 1896.

In 1900, Oliver Lippincott became the first to drive an automobile into Yosemite Valley. Yosemite Valley Railroad, nicknamed &quot;the short line to paradise,&quot; arrived at nearby El Portal, California in 1907. Numerous hiking and horse trails were cleared, including a walking path through Mariposa Grove.

===Concessionaires===
Yosemite&#x27;s first concession was established in 1884 when Mr. and Mrs. John Degnan established a bakery and store. The Desmond Park Service Company was granted a twenty-year concession in 1916; the company bought out or built hotels, stores, camps, a dairy, a garage, and other park services. Desmond changed its name to the Yosemite National Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920.

The Curry Company was started by David and Jenny Curry in 1899; the couple also founded Camp Curry, now known as Curry Village. The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to allow expansion of concessionaire operations and development in the area.

Administrators in the National Park Service felt that limiting the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound. The Curry Company and its rival, the Yosemite National Park Company, were forced to merge in 1925 to form the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Company (YP&amp;CC).

==National park==

===John Muir&#x27;s influence===
Immediately following his arrival in California in March 1868, naturalist John Muir set out for the Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir&#x27;s employment provided him with the opportunity to study the area&#x27;s plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it. Muir was one of the first to suggest that Yosemite Valley&#x27;s major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.
Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging of giant sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed from being a promoter and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp with him in the area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir&#x27;s cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of &quot;Century Magazine&quot;. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.

Muir&#x27;s wish was partially granted on October 1, 1890, when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a national park under the unopposed Yosemite Act. The Act provided &quot;for the preservation from injury of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said reservation, and their retention in their natural condition&quot; and prohibited &quot;wanton destruction of the fish and game and their capture or destruction for the purposes of merchandise or profit.&quot;

Yosemite National Park included the entire upper drainages of two river watersheds. Preservation of watersheds was very important to Muir, who said &quot;you cannot save Yosemite Valley without saving its Sierran fountains.&quot; The State of California retained control of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. Muir and 181 others founded the Sierra Club in 1892, in part to lobby for the transfer of the valley and the grove into the national park.

===Army administration===

Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was at first administered by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite&#x27;s high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days&#x27; hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing was no longer a problem, but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.

The Army also tried to control poaching. In 1896, acting Superintendent Colonel S. B. M. Young stopped issuing firearm permits after discovering that large numbers of game and fish were being killed. Poaching continues to be an issue in the 21st century. The Army&#x27;s administration of the park ended in 1914.

Galen Clark retired as the state grant&#x27;s guardian in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.

===Unified national park===

U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt camped with John Muir near Glacier Point for three days in May 1903. During that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the valley and the grove away from California and give it to the federal government. On June 11, 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that, and the superintendent&#x27;s headquarters was moved from Wawona to Yosemite Valley.

To secure congressional and State of California approval for the plan, the size of the park was reduced by more than , which excluded natural wonders such as the Devils Postpile and prime wildlife habitat. The park was again reduced in size in 1906, when logging began in an area around Wawona. Acting superintendent Major H. C. Benson said in 1908 that &quot;game is on the decrease. Each reduction of the park has cut another portion of the winter resort of game.&quot; The various changes meant that the park was reduced to two-thirds of its original size.

About between the Tuolumne and the Merced big tree groves were added to the park in 1930 through land purchases by the federal government and matching funds provided by industrialist John D. Rockefeller. Another near Wawona were added in 1932. The Carl Inn Tract, close to the Rockefeller purchase, was secured in 1937 and 1939.

===Fight over Hetch Hetchy Valley===
San Francisco Mayor James D. Phelan hired USGS engineer Joseph P. Lippincott in 1900 to perform a discreet survey of Hetch Hetchy Valley, located north of Yosemite Valley in the national park. His report stated that a dam of the Tuolumne River in the Hetch Hetchy Valley was the best choice to create a drinking water reservoir for the city. Lippincott sought water rights to the Tuolumne River and rights to build reservoirs at Hetch Hetchy and Lake Eleanor on behalf of Phelan in 1901. These requests were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock, who felt the application was &quot;not in keeping with the public interest.&quot;
The 1906 San Francisco earthquake tipped the balance in favor of granting the city the right to build the dam. Rights to Hetch Hetchy were granted to the City of San Francisco in 1908 by Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield, who wrote: &quot;Domestic use is the highest use to which water and available storage basins ... can be put.&quot;

A nationally publicized fight over the dam project ensued; preservationists like Muir wanted to leave wild areas wild, and conservationists like Gifford Pinchot wanted to manage wild areas for the betterment of mankind. Robert Underwood Johnson and the Sierra Club joined the fight to save the valley from flooding. Muir wrote, &quot;Dam Hetch Hetchy! As well dam for watertanks the people&#x27;s cathedrals and churches, for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.&quot; Pinchot, who was director of the U.S. Forest Service, wrote to his close friend Roosevelt that &quot;the highest possible use which could be made of it would be to supply pure water to a great center of population.&quot;

Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, Woodrow Wilson, signed the Raker Act into law on December 13, 1913, which authorized construction of the dam. Hetch Hetchy Reservoir grew as the valley was flooded behind the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam in 1923. The Raker Act also gave the city the right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake, both located northwest of Hetch Hetchy in the park.

Shortly before Muir died he expressed the hope that &quot;some compensating good must follow&quot; from the Raker Act. The fight over the dam strengthened the conservation movement by popularizing it nationally. 

===National Park Service===
The administration of Yosemite National Park was transferred to the newly formed National Park Service in 1916, when W. B. Lewis was appointed as the park&#x27;s superintendent. Parsons Memorial Lodge and Tioga Pass Road, along with campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes, were completed the same year; six hundred automobiles entered the east side of the park using Tioga Road that summer. The &quot;All-Weather Highway&quot; (now State Route 140) opened in 1926, ensuring year-long visitation and delivery of supplies under normal conditions.

Completion of the -long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 significantly reduced travel time to Yosemite Valley from Wawona. The famous Tunnel View is on the valley side of the tunnel and Old Inspiration Point is above it. A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, and greatly increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway out of business in 1945. The present day Tioga Road, now part of California State Route 120, was dedicated in 1961.
Interpretive programs and services for national parks were pioneered in Yosemite by Harold C. Bryant and Loye Holmes Miller in 1920. Ansel F. Hall became the first park naturalist in 1921 and served in that role for two years. Hall&#x27;s idea to have park museums act as public contact centers for interpretive programs became a model followed by other national parks in the United States and internationally. Yosemite Museum, the first permanent museum in the National Park System, was completed in 1926.

The Ahwahnee Hotel, in Yosemite Valley, is a National Historic Landmark. Built in 1927, it is a luxury hotel designed by the architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, decorated in Native American motifs. For many years it hosted an annual pageant produced by Ansel Adams. During World War II it was used as a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers.

===Restoration and preservation===
Large floods covered Yosemite Valley in 1937, 1950, 1955, and 1997. These floods had a flow rate of 22,000 to 25,000 cubic feet (620 to 700 m3) per second, as measured at the Pohono Bridge gauging station in Yosemite Valley.

All the structures in Old Yosemite Village, except for the chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, even though they had not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority was thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.

Congress set aside about 89 percent of the park in a highly protected wilderness area through passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.

The &quot;Yosemite Firefall&quot;, in which the embers from a bonfire were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point to create a spectacular effect, was ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be inconsistent with park values. The firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.

===Since the late 1960s===
Broader tensions in American society surfaced in Yosemite when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, triggering a riot on July 4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to restore order.

The Yosemite Park and Curry Company was bought by Music Corporation of America (MCA) in 1973. In 1988, concessionaires brought in $500 million ($ as of 2025), and paid the federal government $12.5 million ($ as of 2025) for the franchise. Delaware North Companies became the primary concessionaire for Yosemite in 1992. The 15-year agreement with the National Park Service increased yearly park revenue from concessionaires to $20 million ($ as of 2025). The current concessionaire is Aramark.

In 1999, four women were killed by Cary Stayner just outside the park. That same year a large rockslide originating at the east side of Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. Tourism dropped a little after those incidents, but soon returned to its previous level.

== Transportation ==

=== The Stagecoach Era ===
For the initial twenty-three years following Savage&#x27;s arrival in Yosemite, rugged horse trails served as the solitary access points to Yosemite Valley. These challenging routes, carved into the mountainous terrain, were traversed by an estimated twelve thousand adventurous visitors.

In 1859, the Yosemite Turnpike Company pioneered wheeled vehicle access to Yosemite. They initially constructed a stage road up to Crane Flat, a distance of sixteen miles from the valley. After negotiating with Yosemite commissioners, they secured the rights to build and operate a toll road into the valley, enjoying a ten-year exclusivity period along the route. This agreement led to the commencement of the Coulterville Road construction in 1870, which they completed on June 17, 1874. Two other competing routes, the Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874) and the Wawona Road (1875), quickly followed.

The completion of the first transcontinental railroad, along with the extension of Central Pacific Railroad services to towns in the San Joaquin Valley, boosted tourism from across the country. From the railway terminals in Stockton, Modesto, Copperopolis, Berenda, Merced, and Madera, seven routes competed to ferry tourists via stagecoach to Yosemite Valley.
The Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company ran a fleet of 40 stagecoaches and buggies, drawn by a stable of 700 horses. During the summer, as many as eleven stages left daily from Raymond train station, traveling to various Yosemite destinations. Their primary vehicle was the Concord coach, though a &quot;mud wagon&quot; was used in poor weather.

Horses were switched at nine stations between Raymond and Kennyville, where the Ahwahnee Hotel now stands. Freight wagons, capable of carrying five tons and drawn by ten-mule teams, delivered large amounts of hay and supplies to these stations.

The trip from Raymond to Wawona was a , ten-hour journey with a lunch stop at Ahwahnee. After spending the night at Wawona, passengers had a further six-hour, journey to Yosemite Valley. Telegraph lines and Wells Fargo offices along the stage route further tied Yosemite to the outside world.

The excitement of traveling by stagecoach was often heightened due to the risk of robberies. Between 1883 and 1906, the &quot;Mariposa Gazette&quot; recorded six instances of stagecoach holdups.

During the forty-year stagecoach era, Yosemite underwent significant changes, evolving into a national park and seeing the introduction of new hotels, public campgrounds, road improvements, and electricity.

The decline of the stagecoach era began in the early 20th century with the introduction of the Yosemite Valley Railroad in 1907, which reduced the stage companies&#x27; traffic significantly. The rise of personal automobiles and auto stage coaches also contributed to this decline. By May 1916, the stagecoach era effectively ended with the final commercial stagecoach trip departing from Yosemite.

=== Yosemite Valley Railroad ===

The Yosemite Valley Railroad, operating in California from 1907 to 1945, transformed regional travel and tourism. It stretched from Merced to El Portal, the edge of Yosemite National Park, offering a safer, more comfortable option compared to the grueling two-day stagecoach trips common since the mid-1870s. However, as the automobile became more widespread in the 1920s, the railroad&#x27;s popularity began to wane. This decline continued into the 1940s with the opening of the nearby Yosemite All-Year Highway.

=== The First Automobile in Yosemite ===

On June 23, 1900, Oliver Lippincott and Edward E. Russell made history by driving a motor vehicle, a Locomobile, into Yosemite Valley for the first time. Their journey was an attempt by Lippincott, a photography entrepreneur, to garner attention for a new store he intended to open in the valley, as well as to promote the Locomobile company. The Locomobile was a two-cylinder, ten-horsepower steam engine with a top speed of up to . Russell, a machine shop owner, acted as the driver-mechanic for the trip.

The Locomobile was transported from Los Angeles to Fresno via freight, and then driven to Raymond. The journey to Wawona was completed in slightly over five hours, significantly faster than the typical full-day travel time by stagecoach. The final stretch to Yosemite Valley was covered in exactly three hours.

While in Yosemite Valley, they attracted a lot of attention. Notably, Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company superintendent Henry Washburn was quite intrigued. After a five-hour drive to Glacier Point, the Locomobile was photographed atop a rock that was an impressive feet above the valley floor.

Despite the historic trip, it took another twelve years for motor vehicles to gradually replace horse-drawn stages on Yosemite routes.

=== The Automobile Era ===

During the advent of automobiles in Yosemite, locals initially opposed their introduction, leading to a ban by the park superintendent in 1906 due to safety concerns. However, by 1912, the quality and prevalence of automobiles had increased significantly. After a road rally demonstration at the National Parks Conference in the same year, John Muir predicted that regulated car access would soon be a norm in all parks. Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane lifted the ban in 1913, albeit with stringent regulations, including a speed limit.

Despite regulations, the number of car visitors to Yosemite surged after road improvements in 1914, further encouraged by the Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company replacing horse-drawn carriages with automobiles between 1913 and 1916. However, costs remained high due to tolls and government fees.

Motorists&#x27; demand for the modernization of Yosemite&#x27;s miles of roads, including miles of toll or private roads, prompted the government to construct a new low-elevation, year-round access route from 1918 to 1926. This development significantly boosted the park&#x27;s automobile traffic, nearly tripling from 49,229 cars in 1925 to 137,296 in 1927.
In 1933, construction began on a 35-mile stretch of Highway 41 between the Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Big Trees in preparation for the opening of the Wawona Tunnel, which cut through nearly a of solid granite.

By 1980, Yosemite Valley&#x27;s landscape was significantly altered by approximately miles of roadways accommodating around a million vehicles annually. Recognizing the detrimental impact of this vehicular traffic, the National Park Service identified private automobiles as a major threat to the park in its 1980 General Management Plan. The agency set an ambitious goal to eliminate all private vehicles from Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to preserve the wilderness and natural beauty. However, the ten-year deadline for this implementation was largely ignored due to the goals&#x27; perceived impracticality according to Park Superintendent Jack Morehead.

In the 2010s, the influx of private vehicles into the park led to significant congestion, as up to 8,200 daily visitors vied for just 5,400 designated parking spaces.

==Human impact==
Plans for reducing human impact on the park were released by the Park Service in 1980. The General Management Plan specified a reduction of 17 percent in overnight accommodations, a 68 percent reduction in staff housing and removal of golf courses and tennis courts by 1990, yet there were still 1,300 buildings in Yosemite Valley and of the valley floor were covered by parking lots in the late 1990s. The goals were not met, but flooding in January 1997 destroyed park infrastructure in Yosemite Valley. The Yosemite Valley Plan was later established to implement the General Management Plan and over 250 other actions.

===Forests and meadows===
The Awahnechee and other aboriginal groups changed the environment of the Yosemite area. Parts of valley floors were intentionally burned each year to encourage the growth of acorn-bearing black oaks. Fire kept forests open, reducing the risk of ambush, and the open areas helped to expand and maintain meadows.

Early park guardians drained swamps, which reduced the number and extent of meadows. In the 1860s there were over of meadows in the valley compared to by the end of the 20th century. The remaining meadows are maintained by manually clearing trees and shrubs. The Park Service has prohibited driving and camping in meadows, a common practice in the 1910s to 1930s and cattle and horses are no longer allowed to roam freely in the park.

Fire suppression encouraged the growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit the growth of young black oak trees. By the 20th century, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led to the establishment of dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression policies have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.

Logging used to be carried out in the area. Over one-half-billion board feet of timber were felled between World War I and 1930, when John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the federal government bought out the Yosemite Lumber Company.

===Increases in visitation===

Muir and the Sierra Club initially encouraged efforts to increase visitation to the park. Muir wrote that even the &quot;frivolous and inappreciative&quot; visitors were on the whole &quot;a most hopeful sign of the times, indicating at least the beginning of our return to nature – for going to the mountains is going home.&quot;

The first automobile entered Yosemite Valley in 1900, but growth in car traffic did not increase significantly until 1913, when they were first officially allowed to enter; the next year, 127 cars entered the park.

Park visitation increased from 15,154 in 1914, to 35,527 in 1918, and to 461,000 in 1929. Two-thirds of a million visited in 1946, 1 million in 1954, 2 million by 1966, 3 million in the 1980s, and 4 million in the 1990s.

===Recreational activities===
Half Dome is a prominent and iconic granite dome that rises above the floor of Yosemite Valley. It was first climbed on October 12, 1875, by the Scottish blacksmith of Yosemite Valley, George C. Anderson. A rope that Anderson laid was used by six men, including 61-year-old Galen Clark, and one woman, to scale the last of Half Dome. Anderson&#x27;s rope was repaired several times and was replaced in 1919 by a stairway built by the Sierra Club.

Sunnyside walk-in campground, better known as Camp 4, was built in 1929. Rock climbers, who started to scale the cliffs of Yosemite in the 1950s, camped there. In 1997, a flood in Yosemite Valley destroyed employee housing in the valley. The Park Service wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4, but Tom Frost, the American Alpine Club and others succeeded in killing the plan. Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 2003, because of its role in the development of rock climbing as a sport.

Badger Pass Ski Area was established in 1935. The 9-hole Wawona Golf Course opened in June 1918 in a meadow adjacent to the Wawona Hotel. A golf course was later built near the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Valley, but was removed and converted into a meadow in 1981.

===Introduced and invasive species===

Introduced animals and diseases had impacted the park area by the late 19th century. Galen Clark noted in the mid-1890s that native grasses and flowering plants in Yosemite Valley had been reduced in number by three-quarters.

White pine blister rust, a fungal disease that infects conifer trees, was accidentally introduced in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s. It has since infected many sugar pine trees in the Yosemite area. The rust is managed by removing plants belonging to the ribes genus, which act as carriers of the fungus.

Trout were introduced in Yosemite streams and lakes to promote fishing. Tadpole predation by the introduced fish reduced frog populations. Lakes and streams are no longer stocked in the park.

Current park managers focus on controlling nine high-priority invasive plant species of noxious weeds: yellow star-thistle (&quot;Centaurea solstitialis&quot;); spotted knapweed (&quot;Centaurea maculosa&quot;); Himalayan blackberry (&quot;Rubus armeniacus&quot;); bull thistle (&quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;); velvet grass (&quot;Holcus lanatus&quot;); cheat grass (&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;); French broom (&quot;Genista monspessulana&quot;); Italian thistle (&quot;Carduus pycnocephalus&quot;); and perennial pepperweed (&quot;Lepidium latifolium&quot;). In 2008, the park began to use the herbicides glyphosate and aminopyralid to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants.

===Wildlife===

Brown bears, also called grizzlies, featured prominently in Miwok mythology and were the top predators in the region until the 1920s, when they became locally extinct. A sketch of a Yosemite grizzly by Charles Nahl adorns the flag of California.

American black bears were a common attraction by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81 people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated to other parts of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.

To supplement their incomes, the rangers trapped predators such as coyote, fox, lynx, mountain lion, and wolverine for their furs, a practice that survived until 1925. Predator control continued however; 43 mountain lions were killed in Yosemite by the state lion hunter in 1927. Cooper&#x27;s hawk and sharp-shinned hawk were hunted to local extinction.

Bighorn sheep, which were driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced in the east of the park. The Park Service and the Yosemite Fund have also helped peregrine falcons and great gray owls to re-establish themselves. Tule elk, which had been hunted almost to extinction, were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California.
