<text>Howards&#x27; Way is a television drama series produced by BBC Birmingham and transmitted on BBC1 between 1 September 1985 and 25 November 1990. The series deals with the personal and professional lives of the wealthy yachting and business communities in the fictional town of Tarrant on the south coast of England, and was filmed on the River Hamble and the Solent.

The series was notable for its pioneering camerawork onboard yachts, often filming multiple yachts racing in choppy waters and high winds, and its extensive location shooting mainly on the south coast of Britain. Most of the location filming for the series was carried out in Bursledon, Hamble, Swanwick, Warsash, Hill Head, Lee-on-the-Solent, Lymington, Hythe, Southampton and Fareham—all in Hampshire. The Jolly Sailor pub in Bursledon featured in several episodes.

All interiors were filmed in Studio A at the now-demolished BBC Pebble Mill studios in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Extensive two-storey sets were constructed inside the studio (the Howards and the Urquhart homes were both functioning two-floor sets). The smaller Studio B (used for regional news) was also occasionally used as an on-screen fashion photography studio. Other areas of the large 1970s TV and radio complex (opened in 1971) were used for the many board room scenes in the series, with long corridors and lifts sometimes doubling as a busy hospital and meeting rooms became lavish corporate hospitality suites.

==History==
&quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; was created and produced by Gerard Glaister and Allan Prior, with lead writer Raymond Thompson as story and script consultant—at a point in the BBC&#x27;s history when the organisation was making a concerted populist strike against ITV in its approach to programming. The series debuted on BBC1 in 1985, the same year that the BBC launched its first ongoing soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; as a challenge to the ratings supremacy of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Although &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; is commonly cited as an attempt to provide a British alternative to glossy American sagas such as &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot;, it also acts as a continuation of plot themes explored in a previous Glaister series, &quot;The Brothers&quot;, which involved a family&#x27;s personal and professional crises running a road haulage firm, and embraced several soap opera touches in its characterisations and storylines.

The original working title for the series was &quot;The Boatbuilders&quot;, which was ultimately rejected when it was felt that it sounded like a documentary series and wouldn&#x27;t grab viewers&#x27; attention.

The theme music was composed by Simon May and performed by his orchestra. Executive Leslie Osborne secured a co-writer credit, but in reality did not contribute to the composition. After series one, Don Black was commissioned to write lyrics for the theme; May had suggested the title &quot;Almost There&quot;, which Black changed to &quot;Always There&quot;. The song was recorded by Marti Webb, and reached number 13 in the UK singles chart. The upbeat variation of the theme, &quot;Barracuda&quot;, was used over the show&#x27;s end credits from series 3 until the show ended, and was a &quot;re-visitation&quot; of a section of May&#x27;s song &quot;Believe&quot; for his musical &quot;Smike&quot;.

Inspired by a storyline in &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, Gerard Glaister went on to create &quot;Trainer&quot; (1991–1992), set in the world of horse-racing, and also featuring several of the same cast members.

==Plot==

The protagonists in the early episodes are the titular Howard family—Tom (Maurice Colbourne), wife Jan (Jan Harvey) and grown-up children Leo (Edward Highmore) and Lynne (Tracey Childs). Tom is made redundant from his job as an aircraft designer after twenty years and is unwilling to re-enter the rat race. A sailing enthusiast, he decides to pursue his dream of designing and building boats, putting his redundancy pay-out into the ailing Mermaid boatyard, run by Jack Rolfe (Glyn Owen), a gruff traditionalist, and his daughter Avril (Susan Gilmore). Tom immediately finds himself in conflict with Jack, whose reliance on alcohol and whose resentment of Tom&#x27;s new design ideas threaten the business, but has an ally in Avril, who turns out to be the real driving force behind the yard with her cool, businesslike brain. Jan, who has spent the last twenty years raising the children and building the family home, is less than impressed by her husband&#x27;s risky new venture, and finds herself pursuing her own life outside the family through establishing a new marina boutique whilst working for Ken Masters (Stephen Yardley).

Other major characters introduced during the first series are Kate Harvey (Dulcie Gray), Jan&#x27;s sensible and supportive mother, the millionaire businessman Charles Frere (Tony Anholt) and the wealthy but unhappy Urquhart family. Gerald (Ivor Danvers) is the right-hand man of Charles Frere. Polly (Patricia Shakesby), a friend of Jan, is a bored corporate wife preoccupied with preserving her social status, and their daughter Abby (Cindy Shelley) is a socially awkward young woman who has returned to Tarrant after completing her education at a Swiss finishing school and who establishes a friendship with Leo Howard. Unlike the comparatively close and secure Howard family, the Urquharts have secrets to hide. Gerald and Polly&#x27;s marriage is a sham—an arrangement to cover the fact that Gerald is bisexual, to give him respectability in the business world and give a name to Abby, Polly&#x27;s illegitimate daughter after an affair at university. Abby herself is pregnant, after a brief relationship in Switzerland.

The series combined standard melodramatic storylines involving family drama, romance and extramarital affairs (Tom and Avril, Jan and Ken) with business-related plots of corporate intrigue and scheming for power, climaxing with an end-of-series cliffhanger.

==Reception==
&quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; proved to be a hugely popular programme for the BBC, both domestically and in overseas sales. While the series was unable to compete with the likes of &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot; in terms of opulence, its stylistic aspects did develop as it went on, with the staging of powerboat races and fashion shows, and extensive location filming in Guernsey, Malta and Gibraltar as the storylines dictated.

A number of new characters were also introduced later in the series, such as Sarah Foster (Sarah-Jane Varley), a glamorous business partner for Ken Masters, Sir Edward Frere (Nigel Davenport), the rich tycoon father of Charles Frere, Orrin Hudson (Jeff Harding), the American father of Abby Urquhart&#x27;s baby, Emma Neesome (Sian Webber), a beautiful engineer who came to work with Tom Howard and Jack Rolfe at the Mermaid yard, and Vanessa Andenberg (Lana Morris), an elegant widow and old flame of Jack Rolfe. Midway through the show&#x27;s run, Charles is revealed to be Abby&#x27;s biological father. In a parallel with &quot;Dynasty&quot;, actress Kate O&#x27;Mara, who had previously starred in &quot;The Brothers&quot; and had also appeared in the American supersoap as Caress Morrell, was also brought in, to play ruthless businesswoman Laura Wilde.

During the production of the fifth series, lead actor Maurice Colbourne, who played central character Tom Howard, suddenly died from a heart attack during a break in filming. Episode nine featured his last appearance with the remaining episodes hurriedly rewritten to explain the character&#x27;s absence. He was finally killed off at the beginning of the sixth and final series, commissioned to end the programme and to tie up all the storylines. The final episode of &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; was transmitted on 25 November 1990.

==Boats==
Central to the plot were three yachts - &quot;The Flying Fish&quot;, a Laser 28; &quot;Barracuda of Tarrant&quot;, the prototype of the Sadler Barracuda 45, and &quot;Spring of Tarrant&quot;, the prototype of the MG Spring 25. Both the Barracuda and Spring were designed by Tony Castro.

==Main cast list==

<text>EMKA Limited is a company that is owned by the Universal Television division of NBCUniversal with the sole function of overseeing the 1929–1949 Paramount Pictures sound feature film library, with some exceptions. It was founded in 1958.

== History ==
In February 1958, nine years after the ruling of the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; case in 1948, Music Corporation of America (MCA) approached Paramount to acquire the television distribution rights to 750 sound feature films released prior to December 1, 1949 for $10 million, with payment to be spread over a period of several years. Paramount saw this as a bargain since the studio saw very little value in its library of old films at the time. To address any antitrust concerns, MCA set up EMKA, Ltd. as a dummy corporation to sell these films to television. EMKA&#x27;s Paramount library includes the first five Marx Brothers films (although it took until 1974 for rights issues to be cleared for &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; before it could legally be shown again), the first four Bob Hope–Bing Crosby &quot;Road to...&quot; pictures, and other classics such as &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;, &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot;, &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot;, &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; and &quot;The Heiress&quot;.

Over the years, MCA took in more than a billion dollars in rentals of these supposedly &quot;worthless&quot; films. In 1962, MCA purchased the US branch of Decca Records, then the parent company of Universal Studios, and subsequently divested MCA of the talent agency business. MCA was eventually acquired by Japan-based Matsushita Electric in 1990 and then by Seagram in 1995, renamed as Universal Studios in 1996 which was sold to Vivendi in 2000. In 1997, Universal Television was sold to USA Networks, 5 years later on May 28, 2002, its entertainment assets were sold to Vivendi Universal. In 2004, Vivendi, merged its entertainment division with General Electric&#x27;s NBC to form NBC Universal. In 2011, Comcast bought 51% of NBC Universal from Vivendi and renamed it NBCUniversal, and in 2013, Comcast bought remaining 49% of NBCUniversal from GE.

== Current status ==
EMKA continues to exist as a division of Universal Television with Universal holding theatrical and home video distribution rights, while NBCUniversal Syndication Studios holding television distribution rights. Some of EMKA&#x27;s films were remade by Universal in later years such as &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, a remake of &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;, and a few other films became adapted by Revue Studios as television series.

<text>Ernest Alvia &quot;Smokey&quot; Smith (3 May 1914 – 3 August 2005) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the last living Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Early life and career==
Born in New Westminster, British Columbia, Smith came of age during the Great Depression and, along with many others, struggled to find steady employment.

He was 25 when he joined the Canadian Army on 5 March 1940, becoming part of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. In 1943, he first entered into combat. On 10 July 1943, he was part of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division landing in Sicily, remaining active throughout the Sicily and Italian campaign between July 1943 and February 1945. He participated in the fierce Battle of Ortona in December 1943.

On the night of 21/22 October 1944 at the River Savio, in northern Italy, Private Smith was in the spearhead of the attack which established a bridgehead over the river. With a hand-held PIAT anti-tank launcher he disabled a Mark V Panther tank at a range of just , and while protecting a wounded comrade, killed four panzergrenadiers and routed others. When another tank was sent to take out his position, he used another PIAT to damage it enough to cause it to retreat and wander in a strange direction. He then carried his wounded comrade and applied medical relief. He later personally counterattacked to disperse the Germans still attacking his previous position. He destroyed in total three Panther tanks, two self-propelled artillery pieces, a half-track, a scout car, and a large number of German soldiers. 

Smith had been promoted to corporal nine times, but demoted back to private each time prior to his actions at the River Savio. He later achieved the rank of sergeant.

===Citation===
==Later military career==
King George VI bestowed the VC on Smith personally at Buckingham Palace. Allegedly, Smith was placed in a jail cell in Rome the night before he was to be commended for his actions at Savio, in order to &quot;keep him out of trouble&quot;; for years, Smith would neither confirm nor deny that such a measure was enacted. However, in a 2003 interview with MacLeans Magazine&#x27;s Ken MacQueen, Smith described the event: “I got locked up in Naples. They just wanted Smoky to be in the right spot. When I was first locked up, I was thinking, what the hell? But then they gave me a couple of beers and I was very happy.”

Smith was asked what was it like to meet the King? “It was kind of astounding. I go to Buckingham Palace and I say to the guard, “What am I supposed to do?” He says, “You do exactly as I do: take a bow from the hips.” I said, “Oh Christ, you think I’m going to do that, you’re crazy.” I just saluted and that was it.

I was given the VC and told to put it in my pocket. I wasn&#x27;t allowed to wear it for at least three days so the Canadian newspapers would have it the same time as the British ones. So for three days, I&#x27;m sitting in a bar in London drinking to beat hell. Someone came and said, “Okay, Smoky, you can put on that medal now.” So I took it out and put it on my chest, and I never bought another drink that day.”

After receiving the VC, Smokey Smith was made a &quot;poster boy&quot; for the Canadian War Bonds drive.

Smith left the service after World War II, but returned in 1950 when he re-enlisted during the Korean War. Because of his iconic status, he was not put into combat. He retired from service again in 1964, having served for some time in Vancouver as a recruiting sergeant. As a result of his extended service, he received the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration for 12 years of service.

He was an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, student # S132.

==Civilian life==
In 1947, Smith wed Esther Weston, with whom he had two children, David and Norma-Jean. After his retirement from the military, Smith opened a travel agency with his wife, &quot;Smith Travel&quot;, which was in operation from 1969 to 1992. During these years, Smith regularly visited sites related to World War II with clients. The couple retired in 1992, and Smith&#x27;s wife died four years later, in 1996.

In his later years, as the number of living veterans began to grow thin, Smokey found himself the last living Canadian VC recipient in 2000. By this time Smith was retired and devoted much of his time to helping his fellow veterans, making frequent public appearances all over the world to assist in Remembrance Day ceremonies and greeting the Queen after her arrival during an official visit. He appeared in May 2000 in representation of the veterans of Canada at the consecration ceremony of Canada&#x27;s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, having aided in negotiations for the return of those remains. Smith was also on hand to unveil a Canadian postage stamp featuring both the British and Canadian versions of the Victoria Cross in 2004. The Canadian Pacific Railway dedicated a railcar in his honour on November 29, 2003.

Smith was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada on November 15, 1995, and received the honour in a ceremony on February 15, 1996. He became a Member of the Order of British Columbia in 2002. Gary Pawson nominated him for the Order of British Columbia starting in 1997, and each year following until he was finally so honoured. He was originally passed over for this honour until Clifford Chadderton, the British Columbia Ministry of Veterans Affairs, and several other organizations, wrote letters to the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia in his support.

==Death and funeral==

Smokey Smith died at his home in Vancouver on August 3, 2005, at the age of 91. His body was placed in the foyer of the House of Commons to lie in state on August 9, 2005, making him only the ninth person to be accorded this honour; government flags flew at half-mast on that day. He lay in repose at Vancouver&#x27;s Seaforth Armoury on August 12, with a full military funeral in Vancouver on August 13. His ashes were scattered at sea in the Gulf of Georgia
== Memorials ==
Smith donated his VC and medals to the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada in his will. The regiment has his Victoria Cross decoration and his full sized medals are [in 2011] in a safe deposit box. The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Museum and Archives had a replica VC and set of medals and a generic World War II uniform on display. Three original uniforms from his Black Watch period were donated to three museums by his daughter in 2011, one each to the Black Watch Museum in Montreal, the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Museum and Archives in Vancouver and the New Westminster Museum and Archives. His 1947 dated battledress blouse and one of his Glengarries are in a private collection.

The Ernest Smith Park was erected as a memorial by Ottawa, Ontario assisted by the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 638 (Kanata), and is dedicated to Private Ernest Alvia Smith, VC, CM, OBC, C.D.

There is Smokey Smith Place, a street in Saanich BC.

In the Robert Heinlein novel Starship Troopers, Camp Sergeant Smokey Smith (located in the Canadian Rockies, B.C.) may be a referral to Ernest Smith, although this is never explicitly stated.

<text>Umrao Singh Yadav (21 November 1920 – 21 November 2005) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was a non-commissioned officer in the Royal Artillery or the Royal Indian Artillery to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the Second World War, and the last survivor of only 40 Indian soldiers to be awarded the VC between 1912, when Indians first became eligible to be awarded the VC, to Indian independence in 1947.

==Early life==
Umrao Singh Yadav, son of Mohar Singh, was born into a Hindu Ahir family in Palra, a small village in Jhajjar district in Haryana (then the Rohtak district of undivided Punjab), 50 km north of Delhi.

He attended a local school and joined the Indian Army during World War II in November 1939. He was promoted to Havildar (Sergeant) in the Royal Indian Artillery, Indian Army in 1942.

==Award==
On the night of 15 to 16 December 1944 in the Kaladan valley, Burma, Umrao Singh was a field gun detachment commander in an advanced section of the 33 Mountain Battery, 30th Mountain Regiment, Indian Artillery, serving on detachment as part of the 81st West African Division in Viscount Slim&#x27;s British 14th Army, supporting the advance of the XV Corps on the Arakan. Singh&#x27;s gun was in an advanced position, supporting the 8th Gold Coast Regiment. After a 90-minute sustained bombardment from 75 mm guns and mortars from the Japanese 28th Army, Singh&#x27;s gun position was attacked by at least two companies of Japanese infantry. He used a Bren light machine gun and directed the rifle fire of the gunners, holding off the assault. He was wounded by two grenades.

A second wave of attackers killed all but Singh and two other gunners, but was also beaten off. The three soldiers had only a few bullets remaining, and these were rapidly exhausted in the initial stages of the assault by a third wave of attackers. Undaunted, Singh picked up a &quot;gun bearer&quot; (a heavy iron rod, similar to a crow bar) and used that as a weapon in hand-to-hand fighting. He was seen to strike down three infantrymen, fatally wounded, before succumbing to a rain of blows.

Six hours later, after a counter-attack, he was found alive but unconscious near to his artillery piece, almost unrecognisable from a head injury, still clutching his gun bearer. Ten Japanese soldiers lay dead nearby and seven critically wounded. His field gun was back in action later that day.

==Later life==
Singh was presented with his VC by King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 15 October 1945. The citation reads &quot;Havildar Umrao Singh set a supreme example of gallantry and devotion to duty.&quot;

He was promoted after recovering from his wounds. He retired from the British Indian army in 1946, but rejoined the army in 1947 following independence. On 1 February 1950, Singh was promoted to the junior commissioned officer rank of &quot;jemadar&quot; (equivalent to the present-day rank of &quot;naib subedar&quot;). He was promoted to subedar major on 2 May 1968, and to the honorary rank of captain on 15 August 1970. After leaving the army a second time, he returned to farm his family&#x27;s 2 acre (8,000 m2) smallholding.

At the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of VE Day in London in 1995, he was almost turned away from the VIP tent because his name was not on the correct list, but Brigadier Tom Longland, who had organised the event, recognised his medal and gave orders for him to be admitted. After the event, Singh complained to British Prime Minister John Major about the meagre pension of £168 per year paid to the then ten surviving Indian VC holders. The amount had remained fixed since 1960, but Major subsequently arranged for the pension to be raised to £1,300 per year. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1983.

He attended the service of dedication of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Memorial in Westminster Abbey on 14 May 2003. In his book &#x27;Toward Resurgent India&#x27;, Lt. Gen. (Retd.) M. M. Lakhera, PVSM, AVSM, VSM writes:


After being diagnosed with prostate cancer in July 2005, he died, at the Army Research and Referral hospital in New Delhi on his 85th birthday, 21 November 2005. He was cremated in his native village with full military honours, attended by Bhupinder Singh Hooda (Chief Minister of Haryana), General Joginder Jaswant Singh (Army Chief), and Lt Gen Charanjit Singh (Director General of Artillery). His wife, Vimla pre-deceased him, but he was survived by two sons and a daughter.

In spite of personal hardship and receiving substantial offers, Singh refused to sell his medal during his lifetime, saying that selling the medal would &quot;stain the honour of those who fell in battle&quot;.

His name was the last one to be added to the memorial of Victoria Cross winners of the Royal Artillery in the apse of St George&#x27;s Garrison Church in Woolwich, London, near the Royal Artillery Barracks.

<text>A foghorn or fog signal is a device that uses sound to warn vehicles of navigational hazards such as rocky coastlines, or boats of the presence of other vessels, in foggy conditions. The term is most often used in relation to marine transport. When visual navigation aids such as lighthouses are obscured, foghorns provide an audible warning of rock outcrops, shoals, headlands, or other dangers to shipping.

==Description==
All foghorns use a vibrating column of air to create an audible tone, but the method of setting up this vibration differs. Some horns, such as the Daboll trumpet, used vibrating plates or metal reeds, a similar principle to a modern electric car horn. Others used air forced through holes in a rotating cylinder or disk, in the same manner as a siren. Semi-automatic operation of foghorns was achieved by using a clockwork mechanism (or &quot;coder&quot;) to sequentially open the valves admitting air to the horns; each horn was given its own timing characteristics to help mariners identify them.

==History==
===Early fog signals===
Audible fog signals have been used in one form or another for hundreds of years, initially simply seashell horns, fog bells or gongs struck manually.

At some lighthouses, a small cannon was let off periodically to warn away ships, but this was labor-intensive and dangerous. In the United States, whistles were also used where a source of steam power was available, though Trinity House, the British lighthouse authority, did not employ them, preferring an explosive signal.

Throughout the 19th century, efforts were made to automate the signalling process. Trinity House eventually developed a system (the &quot;Signal, Fog, Mk I&quot;) for firing a gun-cotton charge electrically. However, the charge had to be manually replaced after each signal. At Portland Bill, for example, which had a five-minute interval between fog-signals, this meant the horns had to be lowered, the two new charges inserted, and the horns raised again every five minutes during foggy periods.

Clockwork systems were also developed for striking bells. Struck bells were developed throughout the 1800s with the use of a governor, including the use of a large triangle with 4-foot sides in Maine in 1837. Ships were required to carry bells, with an exemption for Turkish ships because Islam forbade the use of bells.

===Mechanization===


The first automated steam-powered foghorn was invented by Robert Foulis, a Scotsman who emigrated to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Foulis is said to have heard his daughter playing the piano in the distance on a foggy night, and noticed the low notes were more audible than the higher notes: he then designed a device to produce a low-frequency sound, as well as a code system for use with it. Foulis repeatedly presented his concept to the Commissioners of Light Houses for the Bay of Fundy for installation on Partridge Island. While the Commissioners initially rejected Foulis&#x27;s plan, one commissioner eventually encouraged Foulis to submit detailed plans to the Commission. For reasons unknown, the plans were given to another Canadian engineer, T. T. Vernon Smith, who officially submitted them to the Commissioners as his own. The foghorn was constructed at Partridge Island in 1859 as the Vernon-Smith horn. After protest by Foulis and a legislative inquiry, Foulis was credited as the true inventor, but he never patented or profited from his invention.

Captain James William Newton in England claimed to have been the inventor of the fog signalling technique using loud and low notes.

The development of fog signal technology continued apace at the end of the 19th century. During the same period an inventor, Celadon Leeds Daboll, developed a coal-powered foghorn called the Daboll trumpet for the American lighthouse service, though it was not universally adopted. A few Daboll trumpets remained in use until the mid-20th century.

In the United Kingdom, experiments to develop more-effective foghorns were carried out by John Tyndall and Lord Rayleigh, amongst others. The latter&#x27;s ongoing research for Trinity House culminated in a design for a siren with a large trumpet designed to achieve maximum sound propagation (see reference for details of the Trials of Fog Signals), installed in Trevose Head Lighthouse, Cornwall in 1913. One reporter, after hearing a steam-powered siren for the first time, described it as having &quot;a screech like an army of panthers, weird and prolonged, gradually lowering in note until after half a minute it becomes the roar of a thousand mad bulls, with intermediate voices suggestive of the wail of a lost soul, the moan of a bottomless pit and the groan of a disabled elevator.&quot;

One of the first automated fog bells was the Stevens Automatic Bell Striker.

Some later fog bells were placed underwater, particularly in especially dangerous areas, so that their sound (which would be a predictable code, such as the number &quot;23&quot;) would be carried further and reverberate through the ship&#x27;s hull. For example, this technique was used at White Shoal Light (Michigan). This was an earlier precursor to RACON.

===Diaphone===

From the early 20th century an improved device called the diaphone, originally invented as an organ stop by Robert Hope-Jones and developed as a fog signal by John Northey of Toronto, became the standard foghorn apparatus for new installations worldwide. Diaphones were powered by compressed air and could emit extremely powerful low-frequency notes.

The foghorn&#x27;s musical connection extended beyond its use of pipe-organ technology. In 1982, for example, the Dutch broadcaster VPRO aired a live &quot;foghorn concert&quot; on national radio, relaying the sound of foghorns from Emden, Calais, Nieuwpoort, Scheveningen, Den Helder, Lelystad, Urk, Marken and Kornwerderzand, mixed with studio music by sound artist Alvin Curran.

===Obsolescence===

Since automation of lighthouses became common in the 1960s and 1970s, most older foghorn installations have been removed to avoid the need to run their complex machinery, and have been replaced with electrically powered diaphragm or compressed air horns. Activation is completely automated: a laser or photo beam is shot out to sea, and if the beam reflects back to the source (i.e., the laser beam is visible due to fog or precipitation), the sensor sends a signal to activate the foghorn. In many cases, modern navigational aids, including GPS, have rendered large, long-range foghorns completely unnecessary, according to the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities.

<text>Rolla Eugene Dyer (November 4, 1886 – June 3, 1971) was an American physician born in Delaware County, Ohio. Dyer received his B.A. in 1907 from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and his M.D. in 1914 from the University of Texas. He joined the U.S. Public Health Service in 1916.

His first assignment involved fieldwork on bubonic plague in New Orleans. Five years later he joined the staff of the U.S. Hygienic Laboratory, became chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases in 1936, and director of National Institutes of Health from 1942 until his retirement in 1950. An expert in infectious diseases, he demonstrated how endemic typhus is spread and is noted for developing a vaccine to protect against the disease. In 1950 he was awarded the Walter Reed Medal from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

As director of NIH, Dr. Dyer organized the Division of Research Grants, assisted in planning the Clinical Center, and helped establish three new institutes: the National Heart Institute, the National Institute of Dental Research, and National Institute of Mental Health. He also served as a member of the scientific board of directors of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation and as director of research at Emory University until 1957.

He died in Atlanta on June 3, 1971.

His papers are held at the National Library of Medicine.

<text>Edward St. John Daniel VC (17 January 1837 – 20 May 1868) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 17 years old, and a midshipman in the Royal Navy, (Naval Brigade) during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 October 1854 at Sevastopol, Crimea, Midshipman Daniel was one of the volunteers from HMS &quot;Diamond&quot;, who, under the command of the captain (William Peel) brought in powder to the battery from a wagon under very heavy fire, a shot having disabled the horses. On 5 November at the Battle of Inkerman he, as Aide-de-camp (ADC) to the captain, remained by his side throughout a long and dangerous day. On 18 June 1855 he was again with his captain in the first scaling party at the assault on the Redan, binding up his superior officer&#x27;s severely wounded arm and taking him back to a place of safety.

==Later life==
Daniel also served in the Second Anglo-Burmese War and the Indian Mutiny. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant.

Daniel was the first of eight men whose VCs were forfeited. He was stripped of the medal on 4 September 1861 after being convicted of desertion and evading court-martial. His family sought the &quot;restoration&quot; of his award in a mid-twentieth century petition. However this was rejected with this statement: &quot;...the restoration of forfeited awards may only be made on a petition to the Sovereign from the former recipient himself. In Daniel’s case this is not possible. Furthermore, as your proposal relates to events so long ago it is considered inappropriate to reverse the decision made in 1861 by Queen Victoria&quot;. However, he and the seven other whose awards were forfeited are officially listed as VC holders.

Daniel died at Hokitika in the South Island of New Zealand on 20 May 1868. He is buried in the Hokitika Cemetery.

<text>Captain Cecil William Buckley VC (7 October 1828 – 7 December 1872) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Buckley was born at Patricroft, near Eccles in Lancashire, and entered the Royal Navy in 1845. On the outbreak of the war with Russia in 1854, he was serving as a lieutenant on the frigate HMS , sent first to the White Sea then, in early 1855, to the Black Sea, and the Sea of Azov.

===VC action===
He was a 26 year old lieutenant when the following deeds took place during the Sea of Azov naval campaign of 1855, for which he was awarded the VC, as cited in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;:
&quot;Whilst serving as junior Lieutenant of the Miranda, [Cecil William Buckley] landed in presence of a superior force, and set fire to the Russian stores [on two occasions].&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The first service ... occurred after the shelling of the town of Genitchi, on the 29th May, 1855. After mentioning that the stores were in a very favourable position for supplying the Russian Army, and that, therefore, their destruction was of the utmost importance, &quot;Lieutenant Cecil W. Buckley, Lieutenant Hugh T. Burgoyne, and Mr John Robarts, gunner, volunteered to land alone, and fire the stores, which offer I accepted, knowing the imminent risk there would be in landing a party in presence of such a superior force, and out of gun-shot of the ships. This very dangerous service they most gallantly performed, narrowly escaping the Cossacks, who all but cut them off from their boat.&quot; &quot;Despatch from Admiral Lord Lyons, 2nd June 1855, No. 419.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The second volunteer service was performed while the town of Taganrog was being bombarded by the boats of the Fleet: &quot;Lieutenant Cecil Buckley, in a four-oared gig, accompanied by Mr Henry Cooper, Boatswain, and manned by volunteers, repeatedly landed and fired the different stores and Government buildings. This dangerous, not to say desperate service (carried out in a town containing upwards of 3,000 troops, constantly endeavouring to prevent it, and only checked by the fire of the boats&#x27; guns), was most effectually performed.&quot; &quot;Despatch from Admiral Lord Lyons, 6th June 1855, No, 429.&quot;

He was among the first winners of the VC to be gazetted on 24 February 1857, together with Burgoyne, Robarts and Cooper.

===Later career===
In February 1856, in acknowledgement of his services, Buckley was promoted to commander. After serving on the Cape station, he was promoted to captain in April 1862. From 1868 to 1870 he commanded the , a wooden screw corvette, on the Pacific station and from December 1871 the , a guard ship in the Shannon Estuary. Buckley retired from the Navy in October 1872 due to poor health. He died on the island of Madeira, Portugal on 7 December 1872, and was buried in the British Cemetery of Funchal.

He had married Catharine Senhouse, by whom he had son and a daughter.

<doc id="1188285" wikidata="Q708729" url="?curid=1188285" title="George Burdi">
<text>George Burdi, also known as George Eric Hawthorne (born 1970), is a Canadian musician, publisher, traditionalist, mysticist, and a white power musician who became known for his role in white nationalist organizations. He led the Canadian branch of the World Church of the Creator, which formed an alliance with the now-defunct white nationalist organization Heritage Front. In addition, Burdi performed with the white power band RaHoWa.

Burdi was convicted of assault causing bodily harm in 1995, and was sentenced to one year in prison. Upon his release from prison, Burdi claimed to have renounced racism. By 2017, he had resumed promoting extremist views and producing white nationalist music.

== Early life ==
In 1970, Burdi was born to a Ukrainian mother and an Italian father, both of whom were immigrants.

==Activism==
Burdi came into contact with the white nationalist movement through the father of his then German girlfriend. He became an active White nationalist at the age of 18, and by the age of 21, was the leader of the Canadian branch of the World Church of the Creator, which at its peak had fewer than 20 members. During this period, he wrote a number of articles for the Church of the Creator newspaper, &quot;Racial Loyalty&quot;, using the name &quot;Rev. Eric Hawthorne&quot; (including the January 1992 cover story, &quot;Enter the Racial Holy War&quot;). He has been credited with helping to secure the survival of Creativity after the death, in 1993, of its founder Ben Klassen.

=== RaHoWa ===
Using the pseudonym &quot;Reverend George Eric Hawthorne&quot;, Burdi formed the racist band RaHoWa in 1989. The band&#x27;s name was derived from the phrase Racial Holy War. RaHoWa was one of the biggest hate-rock bands throughout the 1990s. Burdi was also the founding president of Resistance Records, which was the distributor for his band, and other white nationalist bands. The company also operated a web site, and published a magazine, &quot;Resistance&quot;, which covered the white nationalist music scene.

=== Reckzin incident ===
In Ottawa, on May 29, 1993, after a RaHoWa concert which was picketed by Anti-Racist Action protesters, Burdi and the leader of the White nationalist Heritage Front, Wolfgang Droege, led their supporters on a march to Parliament Hill, chanting &quot;sieg heil&quot;, making racist remarks, and giving the Hitler salute. At Parliament Hill, the two addressed their followers.

Burdi then led the group to the Chateau Laurier, where he led a charge across the street to confront protesters. During the charge, Alicia Reckzin was struck on the head while running from Burdi&#x27;s supporters. When she fell, she was kicked several times on her right side; Reckzin later reported having seen Burdi kick her in the face.

In 1995, as a result of the violent confrontation, Burdi was convicted of assault causing bodily harm, and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Burdi appealed both his conviction and the sentence, but on February 14, 1997, the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the lower court&#x27;s 1995 decision (), and Burdi began his sentence. The court &quot;ruled him out as the kicker,&quot; but he was found guilty of vicarious liability by having led the charge across the street. Burdi continues to deny having assaulted Reckzin.

=== Renunciation of racism ===
In 1997, much of Resistance Record&#x27;s inventory and business paraphernalia were seized in an April raid by the Oakland County, Michigan Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the Michigan Department of the Treasury, and the Ontario Provincial Police. The same day this raid was carried out in Michigan, Burdi was arrested in Windsor, Ontario, for contravening the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot; provisions against promoting hatred.

Convicted in Windsor, Burdi was able to avoid a jail sentence with the condition that he not be involved with RaHoWa or Resistance Records. He sold the company to Willis Carto who soon sold it to National Alliance head William Luther Pierce. Burdi then renounced white nationalism.

===Novacosm===
In 1998 Burdi founded the multi-racial band Novacosm. The band, with Burdi on vocals and guitar, B. Valentine on bass and Sy Sylver on guitar, began performing publicly in 2001, and released some recordings as mp3s. Novacosm released one compact disc, &quot;Everything Forever&quot;, in 2003.

===Überfolk===
In 2018 he founded the neo-folk music duo Überfolk with YouTuber PhilosophiCat (Cat Weiss) and in late 2018 they released their first song titled Hyperborean Sun. In 2019 they released their first album titled Music For Nations.

The duo also has an official YouTube channel.

<text>Ross Lowis Mangles VC (14 April 1833 – 28 February 1905) was a British administrator in India and the recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Mangles is one of only five civilians to be awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Biography==

<doc id="1188297" wikidata="Q336767" url="?curid=1188297" title="Squeezebox">
<text>The term squeezebox (also squeeze box, squeeze-box) is a colloquial expression referring to any musical instrument of the general class of hand-held bellows-driven free reed aerophones such as the accordion and the concertina. The term is so applied because such instruments are generally in the shape of a rectangular prism or box, and the bellows is operated by squeezing in and drawing out.

Accordions (including piano accordions and button accordions) typically have right-hand buttons or keys that play single notes (melody) and left hand buttons that play chords and bass notes.

The bandoneon is a type of concertina particularly popular in South America and Lithuania, frequently featuring in tango ensembles.

Concertinas (including the English concertina, Anglo concertina and bandoneon) play single notes (melody) on both left and right hands.

The Indian harmonium remains an important instrument in many genres of Indian music, stemming from French-made hand-pumped harmoniums being brought to India by missionaries in the mid-19th century.

The flutina is an early precursor to the diatonic button accordion.

<doc id="1188303" wikidata="Q503512" url="?curid=1188303" title="Bat detector">
<text>A bat detector is a device used to detect the presence of bats by converting their echolocation ultrasound signals, as they are emitted by the bats, to audible frequencies, usually about 120 Hz to 15 kHz. There are other types of detectors which record bat calls so that they can be analysed afterward, but these are more commonly referred to by their particular function.

Bats emit calls from about 12 kHz to 160 kHz, but the upper frequencies in this range are rapidly absorbed in air. Many bat detectors are limited to around 15 kHz to 125 kHz at best. Bat detectors are available commercially and also can be self-built.

==Using bat detectors==
Bat detectors are used to detect the presence of bats and also help form conclusions about their species. Some bat calls are distinct and easy to recognise such as the horseshoe bats; other calls are less distinct between similar species. While bats can vary their calls as they fly and hunt, the ear can be trained to recognise species according to the frequency ranges and repetition rates of the echolocation calls. Bats also emit social calls (non-echolocation calls) at ultrasound frequencies.

A major limitation of acoustic bat detectors is their range, which is limited by the absorption of ultrasound in air. At mid range frequencies around 50 kHz, the maximum range is only about 25 to 30 metres in average atmospheric conditions when bats fly. This decreases with increasing frequency. Some bat calls have components around 20 kHz or even lower and sometimes these can be detected at 2 or 3 times the usual range. However, only the lower frequency components will be detected at a distance. The usable range of bat detectors decreases with humidity and in misty conditions the maximum range can be very low.

It is important to recognise three types of bat echolocation call: frequency modulation (FM), constant frequency (CF) (sometimes called amplitude modulation), and composite calls with both FM and CF components. The following illustrates a bat making an FM type call followed by a bat which uses a CF type call:

The FM call is heard as rapid dry clicks and the CF call as peeps. These vary in frequency due to the Doppler effect as the bat flies past. A heterodyne bat detector exaggerates the Doppler effect. As the bat making the CF calls flies toward the detector, the pitch falls.

Several species of bat use a composite FM and CF call starting with a rapid falling FM call which slows to become a CF call at the end, giving a &quot;hockey stick&quot; shape to the graph. This makes the call sound different on a bat detector:

This gives a much wetter sound that the pure FM call. Pipistrelles generally use the hockey stick call for general echolocation, but use only the FM part at times. The end frequencies for the Common Pipistrelle and the Soprano Pipistrelle are around 45 kHz and 55 kHz respectively, but these frequencies can vary widely.

There are three types of &quot;real time&quot; audio bat detector in common use: the heterodyne, frequency division, and time expansion. Some bat detectors combine two or all three types.

==Bat detector types==

===Heterodyne===
Heterodyne detectors are the most commonly used, and most self-build detectors are of this type. A heterodyne function is often also built into the other types of detector. A heterodyne bat detector simply shifts all the ultrasound frequencies downward by a fixed amount so we can hear them.

A &quot;heterodyne&quot; is a beat frequency such as can be heard when two close musical notes are played together. A heterodyne bat detector combines the bat call with a constant internal frequency so that sum and difference frequencies are generated. For instance, a bat call at 45 kHz and an internal frequency of 43 kHz produces output frequencies of 2 kHz and 88 kHz. The 88 kHz frequency is inaudible and is filtered out and the 2 kHz frequency is fed to a loudspeaker or headphones. The internal frequency is displayed on a dial or on a display.

A better quality version of a heterodyne, or direct conversion, bat detector is the super-heterodyne detector. In this case the bat signal is mixed with a high frequency oscillator, typically around 450–600 kHz. The difference frequency is then amplified and filtered in an &#x27;intermediate frequency&#x27; or i.f. amplifier before being converted back to audible frequencies again. This design, which is based on standard radio design, gives improved frequency discrimination and avoids problems with interference from the local oscillator.

In more recent DSP-based detectors, the heterodyne conversion can be done entirely digitally.

It is also possible to use a &#x27;comb spectrum&#x27; generator as the local oscillator so that the detector is effectively tuned to many frequencies, 10 kHz apart, simultaneously.

Some early bat detectors used ex-Navy low frequency radio sets, simply replacing the aerial with a microphone and pre-amplifier. It is also possible to modify a portable Long Wave radio to be a bat detector by adjusting the tuning frequencies and replacing the ferrite rod aerial with a microphone and pre-amplifier.

====How it is used====
The operator guesses the likely species to be present and tunes the frequency accordingly. Many users will start listening around 45 kHz. If a bat is seen or a bat-like call is heard, the frequency is tuned up and down until the clearest sound is heard.

Species like Pipistrelles which end their call with a &quot;hockey stick&quot; CF component can be recognised according to the lowest frequency which gives the clearest &quot;plop&quot; sound. Horseshoe bats give a peeping sound at a frequency depending on their species. FM calls all tend to sound like clicks, but the start and end frequencies and the call repetition pattern can give clues as to the species.

====Pros and cons====
The advantages of a heterodyne bat detector is that it works in real time, exaggerates the frequency changes of a bat call, is easy to use, and is the least expensive. It is easy to recognise a doppler shift in CF calls of flying bats due to their speed of flight. Stereo listening and recording is possible with models such as the CSE stereo heterodyne detector, and this can help to track bats when visibility is poor.

The disadvantages of a heterodyne bat detector are that it can only convert a narrow band of frequencies, typically 5 kHz, and has to be continually retuned, and can easily miss species out of its current tuned range.

===Frequency division===

Frequency division (FD) bat detectors synthesise a sound which is a fraction of the bat call frequencies, typically 1/10. This is done by converting the call into a square wave, otherwise called a zero crossing signal. This square wave is then divided using an electronic counter by 10 to provide another square wave. Square waves sound harsh and contain harmonics which can cause problems in analysis so these are filtered out where possible. Some recent all-digital detectors can synthesise a sine wave instead of a square wave. One example of a detector which synthesises a sine-wave FD output is the Griffin.

Some FD detectors output this constant level signal which renders background noise and bat calls at the same high level. This causes problems with both listening and analysis. More sophisticated FD detectors such as the Batbox Duet measure the incoming volume level, limiting the noise threshold, and use this to restore the output level variations. This and other sophisticated FD detectors also include a heterodyne detector and provide a jack output so that independent outputs can be recorded for later analysis.

====How it is used====
With dual output FD detectors, headphones can be used to monitor both outputs simultaneously, or the loudspeaker used with the heterodyne function and the FD output recorded and analysed later. Alternatively, listening to the FD output gives an audible rendering of the bat call at 1/10 frequency. An example of a dual detector is the Ciel CDB301.

Dual FD/heterodyne detectors are useful for cross country transects especially when there is a function provided for recording voice notes such as times, locations and recognised bat calls. The output or outputs are recorded on cassette tape, Minidisc or solid state recorders, downloaded to a computer, and analysed using custom software. Calls missed by the heterodyne function, if present, can be seen and measured on the analysis.

====Pros and cons====
Advantages, As with a heterodyne detector, an FD detector works in real time with or without a heterodyne function. Bat calls can be heard in their entirety over their whole range rather than over a limited frequency range. Retuning with an FD detector is not required although this is done with a dual type with heterodyne. By analysing the recording later, the entire call frequency range and the call pattern can be measured.

A serious disadvantage with real time listening is that the speed of a bat call remains fast, often too fast for the species to be recognised. The frequency changes of CF calls are not exaggerated as with a heterodyne detector and so are less noticeable. Also with some species such as the Lesser Horseshoe bat with a call around 110 kHz, the resulting frequency is still quite high although it can be recorded. The synthesising of the call means that only one bat call can be reproduced at a time and a muddle is caused by simultaneous calls. Surprisingly, this is not a great disadvantage when analysing a recording later

===Time expansion===

Time expansion (TE) detectors work by digitising the bat calls at a high sampling rate using an analog-to-digital converter and storing the digitised signal in an on-board memory.

TE detectors are &quot;real time&quot; devices in that they can be monitored at the time of recording, but there is an inevitable delay while the high speed sampled extract is slowed down and replayed.

====How it is used====
In real time mode, with or without an associated heterodyne or FD detector, the slowed down calls can be heard as a drawn-out bat call at audible frequencies. Therefore, fast FM calls can be heard as a descending note instead of a click. Thus it is possible to hear the difference between FM calls which just sound like clicks on the other types of detector.

After downloading an audio recording to a computer, the original calls are analysed as if they were still at the original non-expanded rate.

====Pros and cons====
The output can be recorded with an audio recorder as with FD detectors, or with more recent units, the signal can be recorded directly to an internal digital memory such as a compact flash card. The whole waveform is recorded with the full call range being preserved, rather than 1/10 of the waveform as in a FD detector. Since both frequency and amplitude information are preserved in the recorded call, more data is available for species analysis.

Early units were equipped with small memories which limited the length of time that could be digitised. Once the memory was filled (usually only a few seconds maximum), the unit would then replay the recording at slower rate, typically between 1/10 to 1/32 of the rate of the original recording. While the recorded sample is being played back slowly, nothing is being recorded, so the bat calls are being sampled intermittently. For instance, when a 1-second call is being played back at 1/32 rate, 32 seconds of bat calls are not being recorded.

More recent time-expansion recorders use large flash-based memories (such as removable compact-flash cards) and high-bandwidth direct-to-card recording to provide continuous, full-bandwidth real-time recording. Such units can record continuously for many hours while maintaining the maximum information within the signal.

Some units are also equipped with an auto-record function and these can be left in-the-field for many days.

Some units also include a pre-buffer feature to capture events that happened shortly before the &#x27;record&#x27; button was pressed which can be useful for manual surveys.

TE detectors are typically used for professional and research work, as they allow a complete analysis of the bats&#x27; calls at a later time.

==Sampling frequency for digital/TE detectors==
Research in 2010 observed that frequencies used by bats can be has high as 250 kHz.). The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem observes that the minimum sampling frequency required to record a signal successfully must be greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal. To record a bandwidth of 250 kHz therefore requires a sampling frequency in excess of 500 kHz. Modern Time-Expansion capable units typically sample at between 300 kHz and 700 kHz. In general, faster is better, though a higher sampling frequency does use more storage space.

==Other bat detector types==

===Zero crossing analysis===

ZCA is most commonly associated with the Anabat bat detector from Titley Scientific. The original bat calls are digitised and the zero crossing points used to produce a data stream which is recorded on a memory card. There are sophisticated timing and trigger controls and the device can be set to respond to bat calls, so that many hours of recording are available in unmanned situations. The purpose of ZCA is to reduce the amount of data which must be recorded to the memory and may be considered as a simple form of lossy data compression. Historically, to achieve long recording times, such information reduction has been necessary due to memory capacity limitations and memory cost.

The solid state ZCA recording is analysed by custom software to produce a time/frequency plot of each call which can be examined for species recognition in a similar way to FD or TE recordings.

====How it is used====

The ZCA detector is usually placed in a bat roost or bat flight path and left for a number of days to collect data. Thus it is less labour-intensive than using a manned bat detector in real time.

====Pros and cons====

While the ZCA detector can also be used in real time, its value is for remote recording over long periods. The analysis is similar to that for FD recordings, but there is no amplitude data included. However it does accurately record each zero crossing point, rather than only one in ten. As with all recording devices triggered by an input, a ZCA detector recording automatically is prone to ultrasonic interference from insects such as crickets. Filters can be written to select a characteristic frequency of certain species and ignore others; some (CF species) are more easily filtered, others are nigh on impossible.

===High frequency recording===

This can be done by using a high speed digitiser peripheral on a computer such as a laptop. This is not a bat detector as such, but recordings of bat calls can be analysed similarly to TE recordings. This method produces large data files and produces no means of detecting bat calls without the simultaneous use of a bat detector. There are however also more sophisticated systems such as the Avisoft-UltraSoundGate that can replace a conventional bat detector. These advanced systems additionally provide a real-time spectrographic display, automated call parameter measurement and classification tools, integrated GPS functionality and a versatile metadata input tool for documenting the recordings.

===DSP detectors===

DSP bat detectors aim to provide an acoustically accurate portrayal of bat calls by using a digital signal processor to map bats&#x27; ultrasounds signals to audible sounds; different algorithms are being used to accomplish this, and there is active development and tuning of algorithms going on.

One strategy called &quot;frequency shifting&quot; uses a FFT signal analysis in order to find the main frequency and signal power, then using digital simulation a new audible wave is synthesized from the original one divided by a defined value.

The processes of Frequency Division and Heterodyne conversion can also be performed digitally.

===Time domain signal coding===

This type of bat detector is believed to be in pre-production or experimental and is not available commercially. Research is in progress for analysing many types of ultrasound calls and sounds besides those of bats.

A TDSC detector digitises the original calls and derives a two dimensional data string by analysing the parameters of each call with respect to time. This is analysed by a neural network to provide pattern recognition for each species.

==Non-acoustic detection==

Visual observation is the obvious means of detecting bats, but of course this can only be done in daylight or crepuscular conditions (i.e., dusk and dawn). Emergence counts are done visually at dusk, using a bat detector for confirmation of species. In lower light conditions a night vision device can be used but the more affordable generation 1 type has a lag time which fails to provide a suitable image of a flying bat.

Infrared (IR) cameras and camcorders are used with an IR illuminator to observe bat emergences and bat behaviour inside and outside roosts. The problem with this method is that deriving a count from a recording is tedious and time consuming, but camcorders can be useful as a backup in roost emergence counts to observe bats re-entering the roost. Many Sony camcorders are sensitive to infrared.

Infrared beam devices usually consist of a dual array of invisible IR beams. The size of the roost entrance determines the number of beams necessary and thus the power required and potential for off-mains use. Single beam DIY systems are available for bat boxes but these do not log the direction of transit. Almost all the systems in use today are non-commercial or DIY. A system in use in some mines in Wisconsin uses two arrays of beams however they are spaced quite far apart and consequently only log approximately 50% of the bats although extrapolated figures are achieved through correlation of time stamped video and beam break data. The Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) uses two similar systems with beams spaced close enough together that every bat transiting the entrance is logged along with the temperature. These systems require either mains power or 12 V deep cycle batteries. They can be used in conjunction with an Anabat Zcaim installed in a 6&quot; soil pipe and pointed across the roost entrance to discriminate between species by correlating the time stamp data from the IR array and filtered Anabat Zcaim data for horseshoe bats (relatively easy due to their easily identifiable CF echolocation which can be filtered automatically using Anabat software).

Data from beam break systems must be carefully analysed to eliminate &quot;light sampling behaviour&quot; (environment sampling) where the bats repeatedly leave the roost and return immediately if the conditions are not suitable. Some systems discriminate for bat-sized animals; they determine if the beams are broken by a bat sized animal and ignore all other transits. It is important that data is analysed using a methodology which takes light sampling behaviour into account. The method which seems to give the most accurate results is as follows: &quot;out&quot; transit assigned 1, &quot;in&quot; transit assigned -1. Start count is set to zero at 4 p.m. daily. Using a spreadsheet, the counts are added cumulatively from 4 p.m. each day until 9 a.m. the next day. The maximum &quot;positive&quot; count can easily be found for each day. Since every transit is time stamped, the exact time of the maximum daily count is also known. Light sampling counts are eliminated from the data since an &quot;out&quot; 1 is cancelled by an &quot;in&quot; -1, resulting in a cumulative count of zero for light sampling bats.

Thermal imagers which are of a high enough definition to register bats at over 30 metres range are expensive, but have been used to assess the dangers of wind turbines to birds and bats. &quot;Affordable&quot; thermal imagers have a bat detecting range about the same order of acoustic bat detectors due to the small size and the low heat emissions of bats.

Passive infrared sensors are slow with a response speed of the order of a tenth of a second and will normally not detect a small fast mammal like a bat.

Radar has been used to detect bats beyond the acoustic limit, but is very costly in equipment and man hours. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) installations are capable of detecting bats, but are usually situated where few bats fly. There are very few suitable mobile terrestrial radars available anywhere. Hand-held doppler radar modules have been used in the field to allow researchers to compensate for the doppler shift imposed on recordings of bat signals due to their flight speed. This allows the researchers to tell whether the bats are changing the pitch of their calls in flight.

<text>General Sir Charles John Stanley Gough, ( ; 28 January 1832 – 6 September 1912) was a senior British Indian Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Gough was born into a family of Anglo-Irish gentry in Chittagong, Bengal, British India on 28 January 1832.

==Career==

At age 16, Gough moved back to India, joined the 8th Bengal Cavalry, and served through the Second Anglo-Sikh War. By the age of 25, he was a major in the 5th Bengal European Cavalry.

During the Indian Mutiny, Gough and his brother Hugh were members of the Guides Corps, where they took part in the Siege of Lucknow and Gough was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for deeds which included saving his brother. The award was announced on 21 October 1859, and the citation read:

After the Mutiny, Gough continued to serve as a cavalry officer with the Indian Army, and took part in the Bhutan War of 1864–5.

On the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Afghan War in November 1878, Gough was appointed a brigade commander in the Peshawar Valley Field Force, which invaded Afghanistan via the Khyber Pass. In December 1879 he led a column to relieve the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment, his advance precipitating an Afghan assault on the Sherpur garrison, which failed before his arrival. To mark his service during the war, Gough was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1881.

Gough then held a number of senior posts, including command of the Hyderabad contingent from 1881 to 1885, and the Allahabad division from 1886 to 1890.

In April 1894 Gough achieved the rank of general, and in 1895 was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), retiring to Ireland the same year.

He died on 6 September 1912 aged 80 in Clonmel, County Tipperary in Ireland.

==Family==
He was the son of Judge George Gough and Charlotte Margaret Becher; brother of General Sir Hugh Gough and great-nephew of Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Gough.

On 16 June 1870 he married Harriette Anastasia de la Poer. They had six children, of whom only two, the future General Sir Hubert de la Poer Gough and Brigadier General Sir John Edmond Gough, survived to adulthood.

==Medals==
His medals, including the VC, are on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Mark Rosewater (born May 25, 1967) is the head designer for &quot;&quot;, a position he has held since 2003.

==Biography==
Rosewater grew up in Pepper Pike, Ohio. In his youth, he worked as a professional magician. Rosewater has described his young self as a &quot;social outcast&quot; whose intelligence and small size led to bullying. He also suffered from Hypodontia and had to have his baby teeth surgically removed. Despite these difficulties, he became a successful high school student at Orange High School with numerous scholarship offers. He attended Boston University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Communication.

==Career==

=== Television===

After graduating, Rosewater started his career in television as a runner. He then found work as a writer. Before 1994 he was on the writing staff of &quot;Roseanne&quot;. He is credited for two Roseanne episodes: &quot;Vegas, Vegas&quot; and &quot;Take My Bike, Please&quot;, both aired in 1991. He considered his time in Hollywood a &quot;roller coaster ride.&quot; While working as a freelance writer he took a job at a game store in order to have some social contacts. Working there he first found out about &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; from a customer.

===&quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;===
Since 1995, Rosewater has worked for Wizards of the Coast, the company which makes &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. He wrote puzzles based on &quot;Magic&quot; cards and other articles for &quot;The Duelist&quot;, the Wizards of the Coast magazine promoting and covering &quot;Magic&quot;. In 1996 &quot;Magic: The Puzzling&quot; was published, a collection of 25 puzzles written for &quot;The Duelist&quot;. Since 1996 Rosewater has worked for Wizards of the Coast as a designer of &quot;Magic&quot; cards. Rosewater has designed at least one card for every Magic expansion since &quot;Alliances&quot;. While working for Wizards of the Coast, he wrote columns called “Insider Trading” for the magazines &quot;The Duelist&quot;, &quot;Topdeck&quot;, and &quot;The Sideboard&quot; which gave an inside look at &quot;Magic&quot; design.

Rosewater has been the lead designer for &quot;Tempest&quot;, &quot;Urza’s Destiny&quot;, &quot;Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Mirrodin&quot;, &quot;Fifth Dawn&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Future Sight&quot;, &quot;Shadowmoor&quot;, &quot;Eventide&quot;, &quot;Zendikar&quot;, &quot;Scars of Mirrodin&quot;, &quot;Innistrad&quot;, &quot;Dark Ascension&quot;, &quot;Gatecrash&quot;, &quot;Theros&quot;, &quot;Khans of Tarkir&quot;, &quot;Battle for Zendikar&quot;, &quot;Kaladesh&quot;, &quot;Amonkhet&quot;, &quot;Ixalan&quot;, &quot;Unstable&quot;, &quot;Dominaria,&quot; &quot;Guilds of Ravnica&quot;, &quot;Ravnica Allegiance&quot;, &quot;War of the Spark&quot;, &quot;Throne of Eldraine&quot;, &quot;Unsanctioned&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Zendikar Rising,&quot; &quot;&quot;, &quot;Innistrad: Crimson Vow&quot;, &quot;Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Unfinity&quot;, &quot;Phyrexia: All Will Be One&quot;, &quot;March of the Machine&quot;, &quot;The Lost Caverns of Ixalan&quot;, and &quot;Murders at Karlov Manor.&quot; He was also the sole designer of &quot;Unglued&quot;; in it he combined his career as a magic card designer with his previous career as a comedy writer. Picking up on the comic note of the &quot;un&quot;-sets, he judged the &quot;Unglued&quot; pre-release wearing a chicken suit and the &quot;Unhinged&quot; pre-release wearing a donkey suit. He also wrote flavor text in various sets including Mirage and Tempest.

Rosewater advocated for Pro Tournament (organized, competitive Magic play with significant cash prizes) for years, including the important idea of having feature matches at professional events. Feature matches are chosen at Pro Tournaments to be highlighted for spectators and web coverage because the players or the decks involved are well known or thought to be of greater interest. He is notable for his quick ascent to the head of Magic the Gathering as well as his personable demeanor.

Since 2002, Rosewater has a weekly column called &quot;Making Magic&quot; on magicthegathering.com, the official site of Wizards of the Coast. In these columns, much like in his previous &quot;Insider Trader&quot;-columns he gives an inside look on how Magic cards are created. He has written on many controversial subjects, such as why Wizards of the Coast makes &quot;bad rares&quot;.
Other key subjects of his columns include Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;psychographic&quot; profiles of players called &quot;Timmy/Tammy&quot;, &quot;Johnny/Jenny&quot;, &quot;Vorthos&quot;, and &quot;Spike&quot; and the color wheel. He often writes his articles in off-the-wall or unusual styles. For instance in one column he took the perspective of the Magic card &quot;&quot;, in another he wrote from the perspective of the mechanic &quot;splice&quot;. One article, which even had the subject &quot;Mark Rosewater Admits He’s %#@$ Insane!&quot; was written like a bulletin board on one of his columns. Many articles also touch upon his personal life. Rosewater claims he reads every email sent to him and has written several mailbag columns in which he responds to praise and criticism alike.

In December 2003, he became Magic&#x27;s lead designer, later called head designer. Before that he was senior head designer. As head designer Rosewater has written a &quot;State of Design&quot; column every year. In it he reviews the &quot;Magic&quot; design of the previous year and given plans for future &quot;Magic&quot; designs. His most important contribution as a head designer is the institution of block design.

Rosewater&#x27;s nickname is Maro. This came about because the old email system of Wizards of the Coast had a feature that could complete names based on the letters typed, and Bill Rose realized that maro was the shortest unique combination of letters needed to compose a message. In the &quot;Mirage&quot; expansion of the card game, a creature card named &quot;&quot; named after him was included; Rosewater claims that it is his favorite Magic card. is his second favorite card. He made the art of this card himself, for which he was paid a $1.00 check, which he never cashed. He is also known for his podcast, Drive to Work, where he talks in depth about various disjointed subjects, usually by himself. Rosewater considers his personality to align with that ascribed to blue-red in the game itself, and the player profile of &quot;Johnny&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rosewater is married to Lora Rosewater. They have three children: a daughter, Rachel (born 2000), and twins Adam and Sarah (born 2004). As a hobby Rosewater likes &quot;stereotypically geeky things&quot;, such as comics, television, games and writing. For instance, he owns a collection of action figures of comic book characters.
He was once trapped inside Fred Astaire&#x27;s estate.

<doc id="1188313" wikidata="Q1680609" url="?curid=1188313" title="Thomas Henry Kavanagh">
<text>Thomas Henry Kavanagh VC (15 July 1821 – 13 November 1882) was a member of the Bengal Civil Service and Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry which can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He is one of only five civilians to have ever been awarded the VC.

==Indian Mutiny==

Kavanagh was a 36-year-old civilian in the Bengal Civil Service, an assistant commissioner in Oudh during the Indian Mutiny, when the following deed took place on 9 November 1857 at the Siege of Lucknow, India for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:

An erratum appeared in a later edition of the &quot;London Gazette&quot; stating that the deed was actually performed on 9 November as follows:
He was nicknamed by the British press as Lucknow Kavanagh.

==Later life==
In addition to the Victoria Cross, Kavanagh was promoted to be an assistant commissioner in Oudh, and helped in the suppression of scattered mutineers.

Kavanagh died in Gibraltar on 13 November 1882, and is buried at North Front Cemetery, Gibraltar. He was one of only five civilians ever to be awarded the VC. 

His medal (and a first edition of his book, &quot;How I Won The Victoria Cross&quot;) was held for more than 50 years by HistoricalMilitaria.com in Toronto, Canada. 

The VC was sold at auction at Noonans Mayfair on 14 September 2022 for a record hammer price of £750,000.

==In fiction==
Kavanagh appears in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot; in which he is portrayed as a bungling glory-seeker who has to be led through the enemy lines by a reluctant and terrified Flashman.

<text>The enrolled bill rule is a principle of judicial interpretation of rules of procedure in legislative bodies and rule of recognition. Under the doctrine, once a bill passes a legislative body and is signed into law, the courts assume that all rules of procedure in the enactment process were properly followed. That is, &quot;[i]f a legislative document is authenticated in regular form by the appropriate officials, the court treats that document as properly adopted.&quot;

==United Kingdom==
The doctrine was adopted in &quot;The King v. Arundel&quot;. It was based on the proposition that when an Act was passed and assented to, it was affixed with the Great Seal, the &quot;effective legal act of enactment&quot;. It was &quot;a regal act, and no official might dispute the king&#x27;s word&quot;.

The enrolled bill rule was restated by Lord Campbell in &quot;Edinburgh &amp; Dalkeith Railway Co v Wauchope&quot;. In that case it was complained that the passage of a private bill was defective because proper notice had not been given. The House of Lords rejected the notion that the validity of an Act could be questioned.

==United States==
In the United States, the rule was adopted by the Supreme Court in . In effect, the court ruled that the enrolled bill signed by the presiding officers of the two houses of Congress was the best evidence of what had been passed, being on balance better evidence than the journals of the respective houses, so it should not be called into question.

===State law===
At the time of the decision in &quot;Field&quot;, nine states had adopted the doctrine, and thirteen had rejected it. At least two states have weakened it:

*The Supreme Court of Kentucky has held that &quot;there is a prima facie presumption that an enrolled bill is valid but such presumption may be overcome by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence establishing that constitutional requirements have not been met&quot;.
*The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has limited the application of the doctrine. It held, &quot;When a law has been passed and approved and certified in due form, it is no part of the duty of the judiciary to go behind the law as duly certified to inquire into the observance of form in its passage&quot;, but the court also noted that &quot;it would be a serious dereliction ... to deliberately ignore a clear constitutional violation&quot;.

<text>Jos is a city in the North-Central region of Nigeria. The city has a population of about 900,000 residents based on the 2006 census. Popularly called &quot;J-Town&quot;, it is the administrative capital and largest city of Plateau State. The city is situated on the Jos plateau which is lies within the Guinea Savannah of North-Central Nigeria. It connects most of the North-Eastern capitals to the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, by road. Driving in and out of Jos, traffic encounters very steep and windy bends and mountainous sceneries typical of the plateau, from which the state derives its name.

During the period of British colonial rule, Jos became an important centre for tin mining after large deposits of cassiterite, the main ore for the metal, were discovered. It is also the trading hub of Plateau State as commercial activities are steadily increasing.

==History==
The earliest known settlers of the land that would come to be known as Nigeria were the Nok people ( BC), skilled artisans from around the Jos area who mysteriously vanished in the late first millennium.
According to the historian Sen Luka Gwom Zangabadt, the area known as Jos today was inhabited by indigenous ethnic groups who were mostly farmers. During the British colonial period, direct rule was introduced for the indigenous ethnic groups on the Jos Plateau since they were not under the Fulani emirates where indirect rule was used. According to the historian Samuel N Nwabara, the Fulani empire controlled most of northern Nigeria, except the Plateau province and the Berom, Ngas, Tiv, Jukun and Idoma ethnic groups. It was the discovery of tin by the British that led to the influx of other ethnic groups such as the Hausa from the north, southeastern Igbo, and Yoruba from the country&#x27;s southwest. As such, Jos is often recognised as a cosmopolitan Nigerian city.

According to the white paper of the commission of inquiry into the 1894 crisis, Ames, a British colonial administrator, said that the original name for Jos was &quot;Gwosh&quot; in the Izere language (spoken by the Afusari, the first settlers in the area), which was a village situated at the current site of the city; according to Ames, the Hausa, who arrived there after, wrongly pronounced Gwosh as &quot;Jos&quot; and it stuck. Another version was that &quot;Jos&quot; came from the word &quot;Jasad&quot; meaning body in Arabic. To distinguish it from the hilltops, it was called &quot;Jas&quot;, which was mispronounced by the British as &quot;Jos&quot;. It grew rapidly after the British discovered vast tin deposits in the vicinity. Both tin and columbite were extensively mined in the area up until the 1960s. They were transported by railway to both Port Harcourt and Lagos on the coast, and then exported from those ports. Jos is still often referred to as &quot;Tin City&quot;. It was made capital of Benue-Plateau State in 1967 and became the capital of the new Plateau State in 1975. Jos has become an important national administrative, commercial, and tourist centre. Tin mining led to the influx of migrants (mostly Igbos, Yorubas and Europeans) who constitute more than half of the population of Jos. This &quot;melting pot&quot; of race, ethnicity and religion makes Jos one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Nigeria. For this reason, Plateau State is known in Nigeria as the &quot;home of peace and tourism&quot;.

Excellent footage of Jos in 1936 including the tin mines, local people and the colonial population is held by the Cinema Museum in London [ref HM0172].

==Political divisions==

The city is divided into 2 local government areas of Jos North and Jos South. The city proper lies between Jos North and parts of Jos South headquartered in Bukuru.

;Jos-North

The Local Government Council administration is headquartered here. Jos North is the commercial nerve centre of the state as it houses the state&#x27;s branch of Nigeria&#x27;s Central Bank and the headquarters of the commercial banks are mostly located here as well as the currency exchanges along Ahmadu Bello Way. Moreover all basic and essential services can be found in Jos North from the Jos Main market (terminus) to the Kabong or Rukuba Road satellite market. Due to recent communal clashes, however, a lot of commercial activities are shifting to Jos South. 

The palace and office of the Gbong Gwom Jos (traditional ruler of Jos) are located in an area in Jos North called &quot;Jishe&quot; in the Berom language. In 1956, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II together with her consort Prince Philip had a weekend stopover to rest at &quot;Jishe&quot; during her Nigeria tour. &quot;Jishe&quot; was known at that time as Tudun Wada cottage. Jos North has a significant slum. Jos North is the location of the University of Jos and its teaching hospital at Laminga &amp; the National Commission for Museums and Monuments. The Nigerian Film Institute is also located in Jos-North at the British America junction along Murtala Mohammed way. Both the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) and the Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) are headquartered in this part of the metropolis.

;Jos-South

Jos South is the second most populous Local Government Area in Plateau State and has its Council located along Bukuru expressway. Jos South is the seat of the Governor i.e. the old Government House in Rayfield and the New Government House in Little Rayfield and the industrial centre of Plateau State due to the presence of industries like the NASCO group of companies, Standard Biscuits, Grand Cereals and Oil Mills, Zuma steel west Africa, aluminium roofing industries, Jos International Breweries among others. Jos South also houses prestigious institutions like the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), the highest academic awarding institution in Nigeria, the Police Staff College, the NTA television college, Nigerian Film Corporation and Karl Kumm University. Jos South also houses the prestigious National Centre For Remote Sensing. The city has formed an agglomeration with the town of Bukuru to form the Jos-Bukuru metropolis (JBM). Jos also is the seat of the famous National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), situated in Vom. and the Industrial Training Fund (ITF).

==Geography and climate==
Situated almost at the geographical centre of Nigeria and about from Abuja, the nation&#x27;s capital, Jos is linked by road, rail and air to the rest of the country. The city is served by Yakubu Gowon Airport, but its rail connections no longer operate as the only currently operational section of Nigeria&#x27;s rail network is the western line from Lagos to Kano.

At an altitude of above sea level, Jos&#x27; climate is closer to temperate than that of the vast majority of Nigeria. Average monthly temperatures range from , and from mid-November to late January, night-time temperatures drop as low as . Hail sometimes falls during the rainy season because of the cooler temperatures at high altitudes. These cooler temperatures have, from colonial times until the present day, made Jos a favourite holiday location for both tourists and expatriates based in Nigeria.

Jos receives about of rainfall annually, the precipitation arising from both convectional and orographic sources, owing to the location of the city on the Jos Plateau.

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Jos has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated &quot;Aw&quot;.

<text>Thomas Flynn VC (August 1842 – 10 August 1892) was born in Athlone and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==
Flynn is acknowledged to be one of the two youngest recipients of the Victoria Cross; both he and Andrew Fitzgibbon were 15 years and three months old.
His exact date of birth is unknown, but he was 15 years old, and a drummer in the 64th Regiment of Foot (later The North Staffordshire Regiment – The Prince of Wales&#x27;s), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 28 November 1857 at Cawnpore, India, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:
Drummer Thomas Flynn
Date of Act of Bravery, 28th November 1857
For conspicuous gallantry, in the charge on the Enemy&#x27;s guns on the 28th of November 1857, when, being himself wounded, he engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter two of the Rebel Artillerymen.

==Post-army life==
After he left the army, he fell on hard times and was sent to Athlone Workhouse. His local Member of Parliament, Donal Sullivan, raised the matter in the House of Commons in April 1892. After reference to Flynn&#x27;s previous gallantry, Sullivan asked the Financial Secretary to the War Office St John Brodrick:

Brodrick replied that:

Flynn died in the workhouse on 10 August 1892.

A memorial plaque was erected in the Garrison Church, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire.

<doc id="1188327" wikidata="Q2425254" url="?curid=1188327" title="Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau">
<text>Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau (), often simply called Morozov Design Bureau or abbreviated KMDB, is a state-owned Ukrainian company in Kharkiv which designs armoured vehicles, including the T-80UD and T-84 main battle tanks, as well as military prime movers. It was responsible for designing and creating many important Soviet-era armoured fighting vehicles, including the BT tank series, with its most famous designs being the T-34, T-54, and T-64 tanks. It is closely associated with the Malyshev Factory.

==History==

KMDB started as the Tank Design Team of the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory &quot;Komintern&quot; (KhPZ, now Malyshev Factory) in 1927, in Kharkiv, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and was responsible for the T-12 and T-24 light tanks. In the 1930s, the design team was designated as the independent T2K Tank Design Bureau, and began work on the BT tank series. In 1936 the plant was re-designated &quot;Plant No. 183&quot;, and the design bureau &quot;KB-190&quot;. The plant also produced small quantities of multi-turreted T-35 tanks, and had a separate design bureau (KB-35) to assist in their development.


In 1937, a separate design bureau was established to build a replacement for the BT tank series, under the supervision of Mikhail Koshkin. Koshkin pushed the boundaries of the specification given to him, and further development led to the T-34, the most-produced and one of the best known tanks of World War II. Series production began in June 1940 in Kharkiv, and followed by production at the Stalingrad Tractor Plant and the Sormovo Shipbuilding Plant in Gorky . In the same year, Koshkin died and Alexander Morozov was appointed Chief Designer of the T-34 Main Design Bureau (GKB T-34), a post he would hold for the remaining thirty-six years of his life.

In 1939, the tank design bureaux of Kharkiv were merged into a single agency called Department 520. In 1941, due to German advances, the factory and design shops were evacuated to the Ural Mountains. The plant was combined with the Uralvagonzavod Plant in Nizhny Tagil into one enterprise called Urals Tank Plant No. 183.

Although design improvements and production continued to concentrate on the T-34 and improved T-34-85, new design work was also continued during the war. The T-44 began production in the recaptured Kharkiv factory in 1945, and the first prototypes of the T-54 were built.

After the war was over, the factory gradually transferred operations back to Ukraine (now named &quot;Kharkiv Diesel Factory No. 75&quot;). T-54 production was started in the Urals and Kharkiv in 1947–48, and the move ended with the 1951 establishment of the KB-60M Design Bureau in Kharkiv.

During the post-war period, Morozov turned over further development of the T-54/55 to the Leonid N. Kartsev Design Bureau at Uralvagonzavod, and began work on a next-generation main battle tank, which would become the T-64, for which Morozov would receive the Order of Lenin.

Factory No. 75, renamed Malyshev Plant in 1957, built tank engines, and later took up production of T-54, T-55 (1958, the most-produced tank ever), and T-64 (from 1967) tanks. The T-64 was also built in the Leningrad Kirov Plant and Uralvagonzavod Plant. In the 1960s the bureau also designed OT-54 and TO-55 flame-thrower tanks, for production at the Omsk Transport Machine Construction Plant.

In 1966, the tank design bureau (Department 60) and experimental tank production shop (Shop 190) were combined into the Kharkiv Machine Building Design Bureau (KMDB). In 1979, after the death of Morozov, it was renamed in his honor.

KMDB designed the T-80UD, a diesel-engined variant of the gas turbine-powered T-80, in 1985.

==Production==
===Military products===

After the break-up of the Soviet Union, KMDB and the Malyshev factory became the main tank design and manufacture enterprise in Ukraine. However, they were highly dependent on manufacture of components in Russian facilities, especially the Uralvagonzavod factory in Nizhny Tagil. In 1996, Ukraine and Pakistan signed a $650 million contract for delivery of 320 T-80UD tanks. Deliveries were hampered by politically motivated problems with supply of Russian components. Ukraine was forced to develop new manufacturing capabilities and the contract was concluded in 1999. KMDB then began supplying Pakistan with the 6TD-2 diesel engine for installation on the Al-Khalid main battle tank, and has assisted with Pakistan&#x27;s Al-Zarrar tank project.

The T-84 entered service with the Military of Ukraine in 1999, and the more advanced &quot;Oplot&quot; version in 2001. The tank is actively marketed for export, and can incorporate Russian countermeasure systems and a French fire-control system. The T-84-120 and &quot;Yatagan&quot; has been developed employing an auto-loaded 120mm tank gun which fires NATO ammunition as well as anti-tank guided missiles. Versions have seen trials in Greece, Turkey, and Malaysia.

KMDB also produces military tractors, trainers and simulators, and upgrade packages for Soviet tanks and armoured personnel carriers. KMDB&#x27;s BTR-4 armoured personnel carrier has been supplied to Iraq.

<text>The Peak Forest Canal is a narrow ( gauge) locked artificial waterway in northern England. It is long and forms part of the connected English/Welsh inland waterway network.

==Route and features==

===General description===
The canal consists of two level pounds, separated by a flight of 16 locks that raise the canal by over the course of .

The two pounds of the canal are generally known as the Upper Peak Forest Canal and Lower Peak Forest Canal. Whilst there is no evidence that these names were used historically, the designation Lower Peak Forest Canal was used in the British Waterways Act 1983, which redesignated the lower part of the canal as a cruising waterway.

===Route===
The Lower Peak Forest Canal heads south from Dukinfield Junction at Dukinfield in Greater Manchester, where it makes a junction with the Ashton Canal at the southern end of the Tame Aqueduct () through Newton, Hyde, Woodley, Bredbury and Romiley, before crossing the River Goyt on Marple Aqueduct, alongside the railway&#x27;s Marple Viaduct, to the foot of Marple Locks, a distance of . The environs are largely rural, passing woods and fields, with some industrial premises encroaching towards the Dukinfield end of the pound.

Whilst the section through Marple Locks is legally a part of the Lower Peak Forest Canal it is often considered as a separate section, raising the canal through in a partly woodland, partly municipal park and partly urban setting through the centre of Marple, to connect with the Macclesfield Canal at Marple junction.

The Upper Peak Forest Canal is on the same level as that of the upper Macclesfield Canal, allowing boats to cruise from Whaley Bridge or Bugsworth all the way to the top lock at Bosley without having to use a lock. The canal is perched halfway up the valley-side with extensive views of Furness Vale, and the Peak District beyond from Marple through Strines, Disley, New Mills, Furness Vale and Bridgemont. It terminates at Bugsworth Basin, Derbyshire (), a distance of . The village was renamed Buxworth in Victorian times. Recently, the extensive basin has been reopened, and is now a popular venue for visiting boats. There is also a short branch from Bridgemont to the centre of Whaley Bridge, once the site of a connection to the Cromford and High Peak Railway, which ran across the Peak District and joined up with the Cromford Canal.

===Cruising rings===
The section from Dukinfield Junction to Marple Junction is part of the Cheshire Ring route.

==History==

===Authorisation===

The canal was authorised by the (34 Geo. 3. c. 26) and its purpose was to provide an outlet for the vast limestone deposits around Dove Holes. As Dove Holes is over above sea level, the canal was terminated in a basin at Bugsworth in Derbyshire and the line was continued up to the quarries by means of a gravity-operated feeder tramway, known as the Peak Forest Tramway, which was long.

===Construction===

The construction of the canal and tramway was promoted by Samuel Oldknow (the largest shareholder) with much of the finance being provided by Richard Arkwright Junior of Cromford, Derbyshire. The line was surveyed by Thomas Brown and the consulting engineer and resident engineer were Benjamin Outram and Thomas Brown, respectively.

Work was begun first on the section between Ashton and Hyde Hall, where new coal-pits were being opened, so as to derive some income as soon as possible. Outram was somewhat delayed by a request from the committee to report on ideas by Robert Fulton who had been awarded the contract for the cuttings at Werneth. These would have replaced the stone construction of Marple Aqueduct by a somewhat flimsy cast iron trough. Outram, who was experiencing problems with the Holmes Aqueduct on the Derby Canal, was well aware of potential weaknesses. Fulton had also suggested the use of small tub boats rather than conventional narrow boats, and an inclined plane at Marple instead of locks. Outram having privately voiced his disquiet, Fulton&#x27;s plans were quietly dropped.

At the same time as Outram was working on the lower end, he came under pressure to make progress on the section Bugsworth to Marple, and Samuel Oldknow&#x27;s coal-pits and lime kilns. Splitting the work in this way possibly contributed to the £1,100 overspend recorded in 1795, though there were problems getting the shareholders to meet their commitments. By 1796 this had risen to £4,000, but in August the tramway and the canal opened to Marple.

Nevertheless, at the end of 1796, funds from investors were still insufficient to finish the locks and the aqueduct at Marple and Outram was asked to suggest a temporary alternative. He produced two solutions, one to cross the arches of the aqueduct, the other assuming that the arches were unfinished. It was decided not to interfere with the ongoing construction of the aqueduct, so the railway ran from its Marple end to the proposed top lock. The arches of the aqueduct were completed in November 1798—and the workers were given a &quot;handsome treat&quot; in celebration—being finally completed towards the end of 1799.

However, there was still a great of work to be done at the lower end—the driving of Hyde Bank Tunnel proving a particular problem—and the railway and aqueduct saw little use until the canal finally opened along its full length in 1800.

===Operation===

The upper level of the canal and tramway opened for trade on 31 August 1796 and Bugsworth Basin soon became a bustling interchange between the tramway and canal.

Brown and Outram&#x27;s efforts were much assisted by the appointment of Gernan Wheatcroft to manage the canal at Bugsworth and Whaley Bridge. He proved so efficient that he was able to use the threat of resignation to gain the addition of £30 to his £75 a year salary to keep and maintain a horse to assist him in his duties. In a move that would not disgrace a modern marketing organisation, the quarry owners retained Outram&#x27;s future father-in-law, Dr. James Anderson, the Scottish agricultural expert, to write a treatise on the benefits of lime in farming, which they published.

Trade increased rapidly and it was becoming necessary to double the railways. Attracting suitable labour was also a problem. Cottages were rented to convert into dormitories, and Wheatcroft opened a shop where goods could be purchased cheaply. At one point, the employers offered &quot;a good flannel waistcoat and trousers&quot; for each worker, plus a jug of ale each day.

The Marple railway was still a serious bottleneck. The canal company still lacked funds to complete the Marple locks and the Combs Reservoir that would be necessary. A petition to Parliament was considered but, finally, £24,000 was borrowed from Samuel Oldknow and Arkwright and the work was completed in 1805.

At Bugsworth, limestone brought down the tramway was either put into boats to be taken to Manchester and beyond or it was put into lime kilns to be burnt to produce quick lime. The trade in limestone and quick lime (also known as burnt lime), as well as the transport of coal into the basin for firing the kilns, accounted for the greatest proportion of the Canal Company&#x27;s income.

===Decline===
With the coming of the railways, the canal began to lose its business and in the 1920s the Peak Forest Tramway and Bugsworth Basin closed. Later, the lower level of the canal and Marple locks fell into disuse, to the extent that by the early 1960s the lower part of the canal was impassable.

===Restoration===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Peak Forest Canal Society and the Inland Waterways Association campaigned for the restoration of the Peak Forest and Ashton Canals, and they reopened on 1 April 1974. The Lower Peak Forest Canal, from Dukinfield Junction to Marple, was one of seven stretches of canal formally designated as remainder waterways that were re-classified by the British Waterways Act 1983 of 8 February 1983. Under the act, a total of 82 route miles (132 km) were upgraded to Cruising Waterway Standard.

Bugsworth Basin remained derelict for much longer, but was the subject of long-term restoration attempts by the Inland Waterways Protection Society. It was finally re-opened to navigation in 2003 after professional restoration work was undertaken by British Waterways.

In October 2021, lock numbers 5, 7, 9 and 16 were among 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million grant from the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

<doc id="1188334" wikidata="Q56474" url="?curid=1188334" title="Viennese German">
<text>Viennese German (, ) is the city dialect spoken in Vienna, the capital of Austria, and is counted among the Bavarian dialects. It is distinct from written Standard German in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Even in Lower Austria, the state surrounding the city, many of its expressions are not used, while farther to the west they are often not even understood.

== Features ==

Viennese differs from the Austrian form of Standard German, as well as from other dialects spoken in Austria.

At the beginning of the 20th century, one could differentiate between four Viennese dialects (named after the districts in which they were spoken): &quot;Favoritnerisch&quot; (Favoriten, 10th District), &quot;Meidlingerisch&quot;, (Meidling, 12th District), &quot;Ottakringerisch&quot; (Ottakring, 16th District), and &quot;Floridsdorferisch&quot; (Floridsdorf, 21st District). Today these labels are no longer applicable, and one speaks of a single Viennese dialect, with its usage varying as one moves further away from the city.

Besides the regional dialects of Old Vienna, there were also class-based dialects, or sociolects. For example, (Schönbrunn German), or German as spoken by the courtiers and attendants of the Habsburg Imperial Court at Schönbrunn Imperial Palace, was a manner of speech with an affected bored inflection combined with overenunciation. Though based on Standard German, this sociolect is influenced by Viennese. The nasal tonality was akin to Standard German spoken with a French accent. While far less used today, educated Viennese are still familiar with this court sociolect.

All in all, speaking Viennese masterly by intonating sentences with distinctive ups and downs creates a very warm, melodic sound. This is particularly true for the &quot;Schönbrunn&quot; variety of Standard German, which is influenced by Viennese.

=== Phonology ===

Features typical of Viennese German include:

* Monophthongization: Compared to Standard German and to other Bavarian dialects, diphthongs are often monophthongized, (somewhat similar to the way some Southern US accents turn &quot;oil&quot; into &quot;o-ol&quot;).For example:
** Standard German &quot;heiß&quot; – Bavarian &quot;hoaß&quot; – Viennese &quot;haaß&quot; 
** Standard German &quot;weiß&quot; – Viennese &quot;wääß&quot; 
** Standard German &quot;Haus&quot; – Viennese &quot;Håås&quot; 
* It is typical to lengthen vowels somewhat, often at the end of a sentence. For example: &quot;Heeaasd, i bin do ned bleeed, wooos waaasn ii, wea des woooa&quot; (Standard German &quot;Hörst du, ich bin doch nicht blöd, was weiß denn ich, wer das war&quot;): &quot;Listen, I&#x27;m not stupid; what do I know, who it was?&quot;
* The &quot;Meidlinger L&quot;, i.e. pronounced with velarization found in the working class dialect, which reflects the Czech pronunciation.
* Inserting vowels into consonant clusters (epenthesis): Likewise depending on the social class, a speaker, every now and then, may insert a vowel between two following consonants. That usually results in an additional syllable, which &quot;intensifies&quot; the word and usually has a negative feeling to it. Examples:
** Standard German &quot;Verschwinde!&quot; – Viennese &quot;Vaschwind!&quot; – intensified &quot;Vaschawind!&quot;
** Standard German &quot;Verbrecher!&quot; – Viennese &quot;Vabrecha!&quot; – intensified &quot;Vabarecha!&quot;
** Standard German &quot;abgebrannt&quot; – Viennese &quot;oobrennt&quot; – intensified &quot;oobarennt&quot;
** Standard German &quot;Geradeaus!&quot; – Viennese &quot;Groodaus!&quot; – intensified &quot;Garoodaus!&quot;

The following Viennese German characteristics are also found in other Bavarian dialects:

* Consonant tenseness: Voiceless fortis consonants become lenis . The , however, usually remains fortis when it follows a vowel.
* Vocalization of within a word after a vowel,&lt;br&gt;e.g. &quot;also&quot; → &quot;oeso&quot; , &quot;Soldat&quot; → &quot;Soedot&quot; , &quot;fehlen&quot; → &quot;föhn&quot; , &quot;Kälte&quot; → &quot;Köödn&quot; 
* Vocalization of at the end of a word, after a vowel,&lt;br&gt;e.g. &quot;schnell&quot; → &quot;schnöö&quot; , &quot;viel&quot; → &quot;vüü&quot; 
* Unrounding front vowels after coronal consonants,&lt;br&gt;e.g. &quot;Glück&quot; → &quot;Glick&quot; , &quot;schön&quot; → &quot;schee&quot; 
* Rounding unrounded vowels before (which may have been elided by now),&lt;br&gt;e.g. &quot;schneller&quot; → &quot;schnöller&quot; , &quot;vielleicht&quot; → &quot;vülleicht&quot; , &quot;wild&quot; → &quot;wüüd&quot; 

=== Grammar ===

There are not many grammatical differences from other Bavarian dialects, but the following are typical:
* The avoidance of the genitive case
* The use of the preposition &quot;ohne&quot; (without) with the dative case instead of the accusative case
* The replacement of &quot;ihn&quot; or &quot;ihm&quot; with &quot;eam&quot;, for instance: &quot;Hast du ihn gesehen?&quot; (&quot;Have you seen him?&quot;) would be &quot;Host eam gsehn?&quot; in Viennese
* The replacement of &quot;wir&quot; with &quot;mia&quot;

=== Vocabulary ===

The dialect is distinct mostly in its vocabulary.

==== Influences ====

Vocabulary displays particular characteristics. Viennese retains many Middle High German and sometimes even Old High German roots. Furthermore, it integrated many expressions from other languages, particularly from other parts of the former Habsburg monarchy, as Vienna served as a melting pot for its constituent populations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Because transcription of Viennese has not been standardised, the rendering of pronunciation here is incomplete:

==== Examples ====

* from Old High German:
** &quot;Zähnd&quot; (Standard German &quot;Zähne&quot;, English &quot;teeth&quot;, from &quot;zand&quot;)
** &quot;Hemad&quot; (&quot;Hemd&quot;, = English &quot;shirt&quot;, from &quot;hemidi&quot;)
* from Middle High German:
** &quot;Greißler&quot; (=&quot;small grocer&quot;, from &quot;griuzel&quot; – diminutive of &quot;Gruz&quot; =&quot;grain&quot;)
** &quot;Baaz&quot; (=&quot;slimy mass&quot;, from &quot;batzen&quot;=&quot;being sticky&quot;)
** &quot;si ohgfrettn&quot; (=&quot;to struggle&quot;, from &quot;vretten&quot;)
* from Hebrew and Yiddish:
** &quot;Masl&quot; (=&quot;luck&quot;, from Yiddish מזל &quot;mazl&quot;)
** &quot;Hawara&quot; (=&quot;friend, companion&quot;, from Yiddish חבֿר &quot;khaver&quot; or Ashkenazi Hebrew חבר &quot;chavér&quot;)
** &quot;Gannef&quot; (=&quot;crook&quot;, from Yiddish גנבֿ &quot;ganef&quot;)
** &quot;Beisl&quot; (=&quot;bar, pub&quot;, from Hebrew &quot;bajis&quot; house + Yiddish diminutive suffix -ל &quot;-l&quot; = &quot;bajsl&quot; small house)
* from Czech:
** &quot;Motschga&quot; (=&quot;unappetizing mush&quot;, from &quot;močka&quot;=&quot;residue in a pipe&quot; or &quot;a piss&quot; or from &quot;omáčka&quot;=&quot;Sauce, Soup&quot;)
** &quot;Pfrnak&quot; (=&quot;(big) nose&quot;, from &quot;frňák&quot;)
** &quot;Lepschi&quot; (&quot;Auf Lepschi gehen&quot; = &quot;to go out&quot; or &quot;to amuse oneself&quot;, from &quot;lepší&quot;=&quot;better&quot;)
* from Hungarian:
** &quot;Maschekseitn&quot; (=&quot;the other side&quot;, from &quot;a másik&quot;)
** &quot;Gattihosn&quot; (=&quot;long underpants&quot;, from &quot;gatya&quot; = &quot;trousers&quot;)
* from Italian:
** &quot;Gspusi&quot; (=&quot;girlfriend&quot;, from &quot;sposa&quot;)
** &quot;Gstanzl&quot; (=&quot;Stanza of a humorous song&quot;, from &quot;stanza&quot;)
** &quot;Gusta&quot; (=&quot;appetite for something&quot;, from &quot;gusto&quot;)
* from French:
** &quot;Trottoa&quot; (=&quot;sidewalk&quot;, from &quot;trottoir&quot;)
** &quot;Lawua&quot; (=&quot;washbowl&quot;, from &quot;lavoir&quot;)
** &quot;Loschie&quot; (from &quot;logis&quot;)
* from Arabic:
** &quot;Hadscha&quot; (=&quot;a long path&quot;, from &quot;Hajj&quot;)

=== Pragmatics ===

In Viennese, the following pragmatics peculiarities are found quite often:
* Frequent ironic speech that is marked neither through intonation nor through gestures. In most cases, sarcasm must be identified through its context. Especially for foreigners, it is a source of misunderstandings. Such ironic speech is common in the Viennese sense of humour, which is better known as &quot;Wiener Schmäh&quot;.
* Understatement uses recognisable diminutive suffixes, such as &quot;-l&quot; or &quot;-erl&quot;, as in &quot;Kaffeetscherl&quot; or &quot;Plauscherl&quot;.

== Trends ==
In more recent times Viennese has moved closer to Standard German; it has developed into a kind of Standard German spoken with a typical Viennese accent (for example, the original Viennese &quot;Wos host’n fir a Notn gschriebn?&quot; becomes modern &quot;Was hast’n für eine Note gschriebn?&quot;). The typical Viennese monophthongization, through which the dialect differentiates itself from the neighboring dialects, remains, but mostly in the form of a developing &quot;Pseudo-Standard German&quot; that many visitors, particularly from other German-speaking areas, feel is ugly.

For example: &quot;Waaaßt, wos mir heut in der Schule für än gråååsliches Fläääsch kriegt ham?&quot; (Standard German &quot;Weißt du, was für ein widerliches Fleisch wir heute in der Schule vorgesetzt bekamen?&quot;) (&quot;Do you know what disgusting meat we were served at school today?&quot;) The monophthongized diphthongs, like &quot;ei&quot; ~ &quot;äää&quot; or &quot;au&quot; ~ &quot;ååå&quot;, are particularly stressed and lengthened.

The reason for the convergence of the typical Viennese dialects is the attitude, strengthened by the media, that &quot;Urwienerisch&quot; (old Viennese) is associated with the lower classes. With the rising standard of living, the original Viennese can further converge, as it is considered a sign of low-class origins, while the unique Viennese words (such as &quot;Zwutschgerl&quot;) (cf Zwetschge/Zwetsche/Pflaume depending on dialect (&quot;plum&quot;)) however generally remain in use.

Viennese dialects have always been influenced by foreign languages, particularly due to immigration. In the past 40 years immigrants mostly came from the former Yugoslavia, Turkey and most recently (East) Germany; but modern-day immigration has changed, which in turn has affected and created new varieties of modern-day Viennese. As an ongoing process, particularly in areas with a high percentage of first- and second-generation immigrants, new loanwords find their way into Viennese, and so do changes in pronunciation.

<text>A foil is a very thin sheet of metal, typically made by hammering or rolling. Foils are most easily made with malleable metal, such as aluminium, copper, tin, and gold. Foils usually bend under their own weight and can be torn easily. For example, aluminium foil is usually about , whereas gold (more malleable than aluminium) can be made into foil only a few atoms thick, called gold leaf. Extremely thin foil is called metal leaf. Leaf tears very easily and must be picked up with special brushes.

<doc id="1188343" wikidata="Q2165958" url="?curid=1188343" title="Sly Dunbar">
<text>Lowell Fillmore &quot;Sly&quot; Dunbar (born 10 May 1952, Kingston, Jamaica) is a Jamaican drummer, best known as one half of the prolific Jamaican rhythm section and reggae production duo Sly and Robbie.

==Biography==
Dunbar began playing at 15 in a band called The Yardbrooms. His first appearance on a recording was on the Dave and Ansell Collins album &quot;Double Barrel&quot;. Dunbar joined a band Ansell Collins called Skin, Flesh and Bones.

Speaking on his influences, Sly explains “My mentor was the drummer for the Skatalites, Lloyd Knibb. And I used to listen a lot to the drummer for Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Al Jackson Jr., and a lot of Philadelphia. And there are other drummers in Jamaica, like Santa and Carly from the Wailers Band, Winston Bennett, Paul Douglas, Mikey Boo. I respect all these drummers and have learnt a lot from them. From them, I listened and created my own style. They played some things I copied, other things I recreated.&quot;

In 1972, Dunbar met and became friends with Robbie Shakespeare, who was then bass guitarist for the Hippy Boys. Shakespeare recommended Dunbar to Bunny Lee as a possible session drummer for the Aggrovators. Dunbar and Shakespeare decided to continue performing together. They worked with Peter Tosh and his band until 1981, recording five albums.

Dunbar noted about the Mighty Diamonds&#x27; song &quot;Right Time&quot;: &quot;When that tune first come out, because of that double tap on the rim nobody believe it was me on the drums, they thought it was some sort of sound effect we was using. Then when it go to number 1 and stay there, everybody started trying for that style and it soon become established.&quot; According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the entire album &quot;Right Time&quot; was &quot;revolutionary&quot;, the breakthrough album of &quot;masters of groove and propulsion&quot; Dunbar and Shakespeare, with &quot;Sly&#x27;s radical drumming matching the singers&#x27; insurrectionary lyrics blow-for-blow.&quot;

Dunbar and Shakespeare formed their Taxi Records label in 1980. It has seen releases from many international successful artists, including Black Uhuru, Chaka Demus and Pliers, Ini Kamoze, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.

Dunbar played for the Aggrovators for Bunny Lee, the Upsetters for Lee Perry, the Revolutionaries for Joseph Hoo Kim, and recorded for Barry O&#x27;Hare in the 1990s.

Dunbar plays drums on several noteworthy tracks produced by Lee Perry including &quot;Night Doctor&quot;, Junior Murvin&#x27;s &quot;Police and Thieves&quot;, and Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot; 12&quot; track (although the track was produced by Perry, Dunbar&#x27;s drum track was actually recorded at Joe Gibbs Duhaney Park studio).

Sly and Robbie also played on Bob Dylan&#x27;s albums &quot;Infidels&quot; and &quot;Empire Burlesque&quot; (using recordings from the &quot;Infidels&quot; sessions). Other sessions include their appearance on three Grace Jones albums, and work with Herbie Hancock, Joe Cocker, Serge Gainsbourg and the Rolling Stones.

In 2008, Sly Dunbar collaborated with the Jamaican percussionist Larry McDonald, on his debut album &quot;Drumquestra&quot;.

Dunbar appeared in the 2011 documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot; which was featured on the BBC and described as “The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica”.

In 1979, Brian Eno remarked of Sly Dunbar: &quot; (...) So when you buy a reggae record, there&#x27;s a 90 percent chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar. You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.&quot;

==Awards==
Sly Dunbar is a 13-time Grammy nominee. He received two Grammy awards: the 1985 Grammy for Best Reggae Recording for the Black Uhuru album &quot;Anthem&quot; for which Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare were producers, and one for the 1999 Best Reggae Album Grammy award for the Sly &amp; Robbie album entitled &quot;Friends&quot;.

<doc id="1188345" wikidata="Q5592870" url="?curid=1188345" title="Graham Gund">
<text>Graham de Conde Gund (born 1940) is an American architect and the president of the Gund Partnership, an American architecture firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and founded by Gund in 1971. An heir to George Gund II, he is also a collector of contemporary art, whose collection has been widely exhibited and published.

A native of Cleveland, Ohio where he was born in 1940, Gund was educated at Westminster School (Connecticut), Kenyon College, and the Rhode Island School of Design. Gund graduated from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, with a Master of Architecture degree in 1968 and a Master of Urban Design degree in 1969. Graham Gund is one of six children of George Gund II, former chairman of the Cleveland Trust Company, philanthropist and namesake for the Graduate School of Design&#x27;s George Gund Hall, completed in 1971. His siblings are George III b. 1937; Agnes b. 1938; Gordon b. 1939; Geoffrey b.1942; Louise b. 1944.

After graduation, Gund worked at The Architects&#x27; Collaborative in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Gund himself undertook property development for a number of his firm&#x27;s projects. He is also a noted collector of art. Gund funded the Gund Gallery at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Gund was also the driving force behind the founding of the Gund Gallery at Kenyon College. He designed the museum&#x27;s building, a LEED Silver-certified project that garnered multiple architectural awards. With his wife Ann, he gave a substantial gift of over 80 modern and contemporary artworks to start the museum&#x27;s permanent collection.

==Architecture==
After working with modern architect Walter Gropius at the Architects&#x27; Collaborative, Gund began his career with significant projects that drew from a modernist vocabulary. The Hyatt Regency Cambridge, with its stepped massing, recalled legendary projects by architects Adolf Loos and Henri Sauvage, while utilizing red brick characteristic of Cambridge&#x27;s collegiate river-side architecture. For Boston&#x27;s Institute for Contemporary Art, Gund created an unexpected, open, angular interior that played against the rigid geometry of a historic Richardsonian Romanesque building.

The firm became well known during the 1980s for extending this creative take on architecture through significant national projects, some of which were prominent adaptive uses while others were new buildings. Additional museums and education buildings represented the continued expansion of Gund&#x27;s practice in these years. Among the adaptive uses was the Norwalk Maritime Center in Connecticut, a museum and aquarium project housed in a salvaged iron works complex, with a new IMAX theater. New institutional buildings included major structures for Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth, MA, and for the Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta.

At this time, Gund played a role as both architect and developer to reclaim threatened or damaged historic buildings, as in the Church Court Condominiums in Boston and Bulfinch Square in Cambridge. Such activity even led to his being described by Vincent Scully as a &quot;convinced preservationist,&quot; comparing Gund to Charles Bulfinch.

Among Gund&#x27;s early work was the Rockefeller residence in Cambridge (1973), the Hyatt Regency Cambridge (1976) and the former Institute for Contemporary Art, now the Boston Architectural College (1976). Much of Gund&#x27;s work in this period involved renovations or residential adaptive reuse projects in the Boston area. Other projects included the Johnston Guardhouse at Harvard Yard (1983), adaptive reuse of an ironworks building for the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk (1988), and the Art Deco Revival 31-story 75 State Street (also known as the Fleet Bank Center), Boston (1989), in association with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. In the 1990s Gund&#x27;s work expanded to include considerable work with Disney Company in Florida and Paris. Gund was featured on &quot;This Old House&quot; in 1992 as the architect for the television show&#x27;s Igoe Residence project. By the 2000s Gund&#x27;s work was primarily focused on school and university projects.

==Recent work==

Recent notable buildings designed by the firm include the headquarters for the National Association of Realtors in Washington, D.C., occupying a prominent location on New Jersey Avenue, the conservatory for the Cleveland Botanical Garden, the Lansburgh Theater for the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, The Fannie Cox Math and Science Center for Friends&#x27; Central School in Wynnewood, PA, the synagogue building for Young Israel of Brookline, Massachusetts, the Kenyon Athletic Center, and buildings on many American college campuses, including those of Harvard University, Denison University, and Kenyon College. Gund also designed the Boston Ballet Headquarters on Clarendon Street in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Work for Disney==
Gund has designed a number of projects in the Disney Company&#x27;s planned community of Celebration, Florida, noted for a high concentration of work by major architectural firms invited by Disney.
* Coronado Springs Resort, Walt Disney World, Florida (design architect)
* Celebration Hotel and Celebration High School

Other work by Gund for Disney includes the International Retail and Manufacturers&#x27; Showcase at Euro Disney.

==Publications==
Gund&#x27;s work has been widely published throughout his career, with articles by major critics in national publications. The firm&#x27;s architecture has been the subject of two books: &quot;Gund Partnership 1994-2007&quot;, with an extensive foreword by &quot;New York Times&quot; architecture critic Paul Goldberger, and &quot;Graham Gund Architects&quot;, published in 1993, with an introduction by Vincent Scully.

He is married to Ann Gund née Landreth, with whom he has one son, Graydon. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

==Additional Gund projects==
* Church Court Condominiums, Boston (1983) - re-modelled Mt. Vernon Church, corner Beacon St. + Massachusetts Ave., developed by Gund
* Bostix Kiosk, Copley Square, Boston (1992)
* Kenyon Athletic Center, Ohio (built 2006)
* Newton North High School, Massachusetts (built 2010)
*Armour Academic Center, Westminster School
*Armstrong Dining Hall, Westminster School

The firm is also known for historic redevelopment projects including Bulfinch Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Major museum projects include the Plimoth Plantation Visitor Center in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and the Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta, Georgia.

<text>Rodez (, , ; , ) is a small city and commune in the South of France, about 150 km northeast of Toulouse. It is the prefecture of the department of Aveyron, region of Occitania (formerly Midi-Pyrénées). Rodez is the seat of the communauté d&#x27;agglomération Rodez Agglomération, of the First Constituency of Aveyron as well as of the general Council of Aveyron.

Former capital of the Rouergue, the city is seat of the Diocese of Rodez and Vabres.
==Geography==

===Location===
Located in the south of France, in the heart of the triangle formed by Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand and Montpellier, in the western foothills of the Massif Central, the Rodez landscape is situated between the valleys and high plateaus of and the moist hills of Ségala. It extends into , with the communes of Onet-le-Château, Sainte-Radegonde, Le Monastère, Olemps and Luc-la-Primaube, which forms an agglomeration of 83,000 habitants adjoining the city of Rodez.

===Geology and landforms===
The territory of Rodez is packed with geological diversity. It straddles the ancient base of Ségala composed of acidic siliceous soil of Les Rougiers consisting of red argillite, and causses composed of limestones and marls. The city was built on a conical isolated terrain, locally called &quot;Le Piton&quot;, and gradually spread to the surrounding slopes. It is located in a seismicity level 2 zone which is a low level.

===Hydrography===
The Aveyron crosses the commune and is important for fishing. Green spaces are proposed for the Quarter, and the stream.

===Climate===
Rodez&#x27;s climate, a supra-Mediterranean level, is a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), and is colder compared to other cities in the south of France. Winters are sharp and summers often very hot and sunny. During winter, Rodez has occasional snowfall due to its low altitude of in contrast to other towns in the north of the department closer to the higher Aubrac plateau.

In 2011, with nearly 2,400 hours or 304 days of sunshine per year, Rodez was ranked 2,407th of French cities in terms of sunshine, significantly above the national average.

On average, Rodez experiences 66.3 days per year with a minimum temperature below , 1.9 days per year with a minimum temperature below , 5 days per year with a maximum temperature below , and 16.4 days per year with a maximum temperature above . The record high temperature was on August 16, 1987 and June 27, 2019, while the record low temperature was on January 16, 1985.

Events based on the data of Météo-France at Millau Soulobres station, from 1965:
On 28 January 2006, Rodez experienced an important snow episode. A metre of powdery snow accumulated, crippling the Let Piton economy for several days.

===Transportation===
Rodez is a growing city and an important economic engine in the Midi-Pyrénées since the early 2000s. Its location on , the Toulouse-Lyon axis, is essential to its economic and tourist development and plays a vital role for Rodez, as it is a connection to regional cities such as Toulouse, Albi and Castres, with which it is developing collaborations.

As of 2005, the Aveyron department continues to improve its regional connectivity. The Rodez ring road, which surrounds the agglomeration of is gradually being converted to a dual carriageway urban boulevard and improving Rodez as a strategic location. Future plans (2018) call for the entire ring road to be a dual carriageway as part of the 2014-2018 plan. Three grade separated roundabouts are planned as part of the dualing urban boulevard project: Moutiers, La Gineste and Saint-Marc. A major bypass is also proposed but without a specific deadline.

In 2009, the Rodez-Aveyron Airport expanded its terminal and introduction of new international scheduled destinations.

Local transportation options include car rentals and the local bus system (Agglobus). The city centre (centre ville), with its cobblestone streets lined with ancient buildings hundreds of years old, is pedestrian friendly.

====Routes====

=====Railway lines=====
Rodez station is at the crossing point of rail lines from (to Paris), Albi along the (destined for Toulouse) and (destined for Millau). The rail network has undergone numerous restructurings, including the &quot;plan rail&quot; Midi-Pyrénées. Between 2009 and 2013, replacement of rails, the rehabilitation of structures, replacement of information systems traffic operations on the Rodez-Toulouse and Rodez-Paris lines have resulted in network improvement. Additionally, the region was equipped with new TER trains in 2013 that are faster and more comfortable.

=====Main roads=====
Rodez is situated along (route linking Toulouse to Lyon), transformed in the Rodez area into an urban boulevard [dual carriageways, many on and off sliproads, speed limited to between ] to allow the flow of traffic totalling 35,000 vehicles per day. are buried to assess traffic for transcription by real-time traffic maps. The portion of this highway, declared a national priority in 1993 between Rodez and Albi, is currently in the process of restructuring with the doubling of the carriageways, after decades of studies and that since 18 October 2010, date of the official launch of this vast site.

A portion of the RN88 road between Rodez and Carmaux should be completely converted into a dual carriageway expressway and put into service in 2018, thus allowing a virtually seamless dual carriageway journey between Rodez and Toulouse (with the exception of the portion between Albi and Carmaux the route upgrading to motorway is envisaged but not programmed to date). Indeed, the A68 has been in service between Albi and Toulouse for several years. As of 2018, the RN88 which is an extension of the A68 will then almost all be dual carriageway, thus reducing the time between Rodez and Toulouse. Note that this axis is one of the largest in the Midi-Pyrénées in terms of traffic. As for the portion of the RN88 between Rodez and Sévérac-le-Château, this last link is missing dual carriageway, studies are underway but work will not begin before 2020 due to lack of credits granted. At the end of this work, the entire journey will be converted into dual carriageway between Rodez and the principal cities around the Mediterranean.

Furthermore, the segment of the city between Espalion and Rodez underwent a restructuring with the diversion of Curlande commissioned in 2011. A bypass project of the town of Espalion is ongoing since the beginning of this year towards the west of the Lot Valley and Aurillac. With the RN88 which is the most important artery of the agglomeration, Rodez is the focal point of several routes from its own department or bordering departments:

*The which provides access to Albi, Castres, Montpellier, Toulouse to the south and Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon, Orléans, Paris and also Millau, Sète, Béziers, Narbonne and Perpignan to the north. Rodez is located from the A75
*The reaches the International Airport of Rodez-Aveyron, Decazeville (then Aurillac by the and the ), Figeac, Brive then the A20 to Limoges, Tours, Orléans and Paris
*The joins to Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Cahors, Villeneuve-sur-Lot, then the autoroute to Bordeaux.

====Transport network====

=====Rail=====
The railway station of Rodez, located on &quot;Avenue du Maréchal Joffre&quot;, is the main station of Aveyron. There are daily trains to Paris and Toulouse, as well as other trains and buses connecting Rodez to smaller towns. It serves Paris-Austerlitz (Intercités), Toulouse-Matabiau (TER), Brive-la-Gaillarde (TER), Millau (TER and regional bus), Montpellier (bus with mandatory charging at Millau station) and other stations of the department and bordering departments. In addition, it is noted that many other large French cities can be reached by the connections in Toulouse and Brive. The lines and railway infrastructure have undergone important renovations with the complete change of the rails, the modernisation of technical systems and structures as well as the implementation of new systems of traffic management. In the next few years, the aim is for a time of 1 hour 45 minutes from Rodez to Toulouse and 4 hours 50 minutes from Rodez to Paris through the LGV Poitiers-Limoges.

In the past, the Rodez and Aveyron rail network was part of the company of the Chemins de fer du Midi. Formerly, there was a second station, that of &quot;Paraire&quot; below the current Lycée Foch, close to the city centre but closed in the 1970s. Today, there is no service there.

=====Road=====
Rodez is the central point of numerous bus routes coming from the department or bordering departments. Indeed, there are currently nearly 60 routes.

=====Air=====


Rodez is served by the nearby Rodez Marcillac Airport, located within the commune of Salles-la-Source. The international airport of Rodez-Aveyron is the third airport of the Occitanie region after Toulouse and Tarbes, and the main platform of the south of the Massif Central, with direct scheduled flights to:

* Paris-Orly 
* Southampton Airport
* Dublin
* Bruxelles-Charleroi

=====Public transport=====
The city has had a longstanding public transport system, the having circulated from 1902 to 1920. Nowadays, these journeys are made by buses. Agglobus is the transit network serving the communes of the , nearly 60,000 people, where a multiple purchase ticket shall not exceed €0.20. It allows service to the centre of Rodez from outside communes (and vice versa) before 8am with a time range for operation of the service between 7am (5am for some lines) and 8pm. These lines have scheduled timing. This network is complemented by an evening service that operates Monday to Saturday, from 8pm to 11:30pm, by a transport service scheduled running Monday to Saturday with two round trips per day, and for persons with reduced mobility which works at the same times as the bus network. The Rodez topography makes it difficult to create special lanes for buses. As such, the Agglobus network is equipped with a system of prioritisation at traffic lights and also a geolocation for buses.

=====Postal transport=====
Rodez has had an operational sorting centre since July 2009. It receives about 400,000 letters every day and processes 14 per second. All of the letters posted from Rodez to a destination within the agglomeration and its own region are delivered the next morning. Courier services, international and domestic carriers are also present in Rodez. The city has three post offices with its central office located in the city centre, at Place Foch, near the cathedral. Other branches are located in the suburbs as well as in the Bourran Quarter. In addition, other communes forming the urban agglomeration of the Grand Rodez also have their post offices, including the Aveyron sorting centre located in the commune of Onet-le-Château.

==Urban planning==

===Urban morphology===
Rodez is an ancient city, the road becomes gradually narrower as it approaches [Old Rodez] and the remains of the ancient city fortress are still strongly present in the form of ramparts. Its hyper-centre is extended over many streets and pedestrian alleys between the squares of &quot;Place du Bourg&quot;, &quot;Place de l&#x27;Olmet&quot;, &quot;Place de la Cité&quot; and the &quot;Place de la Madeleine&quot;, one discovers typical houses in a mostly preserved historical setting. In these squares markets or fairs are held while the &quot;Passage du Mazel&quot; hosts a daily trade of fresh and seasonal produce. Pedestrian streets, very concentrated in the old centre, today are a place of life with many commercial signs. Beyond, is a long straight avenue lined with trees, leading to a central hub, the , to access the boulevards on the periphery of the city centre. Road traffic is carried around the walls located on the boulevards of Estourmel, Belle Isle, Denys Puech and Flaugergues encircling the centre and served by streets parallel to this historic heart.

Beyond Vieux-Rodez, the city expanded during the 20th century. To meet the demands of the era, new neighbourhoods and economic zones were developed. Rodez was, during the post-war period, an average city that had the most buildings beyond its circular boulevards. Finally, the creation of the Bourran Viaduct allowed the extension of the city beyond the Auterne Valley.

The town of Rodez is part of the Grands Sites de Midi-Pyrénées. It continues to work to obtain the label &quot;Ville d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire&quot; and wishes to file its candidacy for UNESCO world heritage. Thus, the historic centre, and joined developments, are designed to meet the criteria of these institutions.

The municipality is divided into five major quarters:

===Housing===
Rodez has many rental housing units. In addition, the average of new housing has four rooms. Its housing stock remains fairly young, 59% of dwellings are from subsequent to World War II. Despite this, planning is progressing day by day and the homes and other premises have increased by 23% each year. As regards social housing, and particularly the which introduced a minimum quota of 20% social housing for cities, Rodez had 10% in 2007 and stagnated at around 12% in 2011.

===Arrangements of the &quot;Forail-Cathedral&quot; axis===

====Quadrilatère Combarel====
The now demolished old Combarel hospital will be replaced by housing and green spaces. Since the 19th century, the Combarel hospital enjoyed a privileged location in the heart of the city and at the centre of the agglomeration. The purchase of the former hospital by the agglomeration of Grand Rodez aims to impose the site as a centre of activity of the city, as it once was. A conversion will redraw all of the area and allow it to become a real neighbourhood to live, in order to revitalise the heart of the metropolitan area of Grand Rodez. The district wants a place with trees and green space, in which can be found housing as well tertiary activities, shops. The whole of the area will be mid-residential and mid-institutional, probably with the construction of a new hotel. This area will be part of a construction complying with environmental standards. The project is based on maintaining, on the upper plateau, the entire quadrilatère and chapel, as well as the development of the former Capuchin convent.

====Forail public garden====
The Foirail public garden, and the &quot;Esplanade du Foirail&quot;, is located in the heart of the city. Consisting of a large courtyard with various mood lighting, it can accommodate some entertainments and events (concerts, outdoor performances etc.). This place has coherence with the various cultural and economic facilities which are adjacent (, festival hall, cinema multiplex and the centre of &quot;L&#x27;Amphithéâtre&quot;). Finally, the public garden located nearby, having gained 20% more land after the redevelopment of the area, offers different walks around the different peripheral facilities.

====Multiplex cinema====
The multiplex consists of 10 cinema rooms with between 68 and 404 seats, spread over two levels with a total of 1580 seats opened in November 2013. Double access (next to the &quot;Giratoire de l&#x27;Europe&quot; and &quot;Avenue Victor-Hugo&quot;). A fast food area as well as a night beerhouse are integrated within the confines of the cinema centre having also two other shops.

====Underground parking====
To allow the population to take advantage of the cultural and economic facilities and hold a means of parking for people working in the centre of Rodez, entirely underground parking totalling 400 spaces was built at a depth of , and on two levels, under the &quot;Esplanade des Ruthènes&quot;. It opened at the same time as the multiplex.

====Exhibition park====
This project, scheduled for the commune of Olemps will open its doors in the second half of 2016, after work which will begin in 2015. This will be designed to host cultural performances, economic events or conferences, with a set of 3,000 seats.

==Toponymy==
In antiquity, during the Roman occupation, the city was named &quot;Segodunum&quot;. The roots being &quot;sego&quot; &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;dunum&quot; &quot;hill&quot;, where &quot;Segodunum&quot; &quot;high hill, stronghold&quot; is at the origin of the Gaulish name of Rodez.

During the middle to the end of the Roman Empire, the city was called &quot;Civitas Rutenorum&quot;, the city of the Rutènes. Then, it became &quot;Ruteni&quot; and finally Rodez.

Rodez is locally pronounced &quot;&quot;Rodess&quot; [ʀodɛs] in French. That is explained by the spelling of the city in Occitan: &quot;Rodés&quot;, pronounced &quot;Rroodess&quot; [rruˈðes]. Rodez was spelled with a final &quot;z&quot;, instead of &quot;s&quot;, to maintain the closed &quot;e&quot; of Occitan and to prevent it from becoming silent.

==History==
Existing from at least the 5th century BC, Rodez was founded by the Celts. After the Roman occupation, the &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified place) was renamed &quot;Segodunum&quot;, while in late Imperial times it was known as &quot;Civitas Rutenorum&quot;, whence the modern name. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was captured by the Visigoths and then by the Franks, being also ravaged by the Arabs in 725. Later it was occupied by the armies of the Dukes of Aquitaine and of the Counts of Toulouse. English troops occupied Rodez during the Hundred Years War.

However, in medieval times the city&#x27;s history was marked by strong rivalry between the Counts and the Bishops of Rodez, who exerted their authorities in different sectors of the city, divided by a wall. The counts were able to defy the royal French authority until the submission of count John IV by the future King Louis XI in the 15th century. In the following century bishop François d&#x27;Estaing built the Rodez Cathedral.

The last count of Rodez, Henry VI of Rodez, who became Henry IV of France, sold his title to the Royal Crown in 1589. The city remained a flourishing merchant centre up to the 18th century, when the nearby town Villefranche-de-Rouergue was made the seat of the experimental Provincial Estates of the Haute-Guyenne. However, with the French Revolution Rodez became the chef-lieu of the newly created department of the Aveyron and has remained so since.

===Prehistory===
===Antiquity===
Rodez is a city of more than two millennia: its existence dates back to the 5th century BC, when a Celtic tribe of Central Europe, the Ruteni, stopped in the south of Auvergne to found one of these characteristic oppida of the Gallic civilization, that of . Many elements of heritage bear witness to the Romanisation of Segodunum.

While Christianity spread in the wake of the evangelising activity of , the city witnessed and at times suffered during, the less stable times that following the fall of the Roman Empire.

===Middle Ages===
Rodez was successively occupied by the Visigoths, the Franks, the armies of the Dukes of Aquitaine and the Counts of Toulouse, as well as by the Moors, who seized Rodez in 725, and damaged the ancient church. Years later, it was the English who captured Rodez, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

The history of the city remained marked for a long time by an intense rivalry between the Counts of Rodez, who dominated the town extra-muros, and the , who dominated intra-muros. A wall separated the two sectors. Each community had a town hall, its consuls, and its own administration; each competing for power. To the town, the famous dynasty of the Counts of Armagnac and Rodez, eventually acquired sovereign privileges: Coining money at the Martelenque Tower, wearing the crown and persisting to recognise the antipope Benedict XIII and his heirs Bernard Garnier and Jean Carrier, for a time. This led inevitably to confrontation with the King of France in 1443. The dauphin, the future Louis XI, came to occupy Rodez and submit Count Jean IV. Later his son would have a seditious idea, trying to betray Louis XI. This caused him to be killed in Lectoure, with his family, during his escape.

===Early Modern era===
At the beginning of the 16th century, Rodez was marked by Bishop (from one of the most famous families of Rouergue). He finished the work of construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Rodez. He added the architectural masterpiece that is the bell tower, at , topped by a Virgin, yet today the highest bell tower, without a spire, in France. The works were completed in the fifteen years between 1510 and 1526 and this despite the plague ravaging the city.

The rivalry between the two powers somewhat served the development of Rodez. Despite the testimonies that are its many made Gothic masterpieces from the 13th to the 16th century, the city has not really experienced long periods of prosperity. In 1589, Henri IV, Count of Rodez, attached the destiny of the County of Rodez to the Crown. The story of Rodez then copied that of France. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Rodez became a thriving market city.

Rodez was divided into 6 parishes:

*Notre-Dame (cathedral, suburb)
*Saint-Amans, including the hamlet of Pont-Viel, a large part of the territory of the current commune of Olemps (Olemps, La Mouline, Toizac, Linars, Benechou) and a part of the municipality of La Monastère (Foulhoubous)
*Sainte-Catherine
*La Madeleine (church demolished)
*Saint-Martin-des-Prés (Layoule area)
*Saint-Félix: The area of Saint-Felix, Calcomier, La Peyrinie, and the entire valley of the Fontanges stream located in the current municipality of Onet-le-Château (Canaguet, Fontanges, Floyrac, Labro, , Puech Baurez Flars)

===Modern era===
The old rival of Rodez was Villefranche-de-Rouergue. The French Revolution took away Villefranche&#x27;s role of administrative capital, for the benefit of Rodez, which became prefecture and of the new department of Aveyron due to its central position. The religious heritage of the city was only partially degraded.

In June 1792, the scientists of the time cared about to know the exact measurement of the metre. Rodez would be a &quot;central&quot; element to accomplish this measure. Indeed, Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre was responsible for measuring the distance from Dunkirk to Rodez, while Pierre Méchain was the one measuring between Barcelona and Rodez. They were to meet in Rodez to combine their results and determine the value of the metre. In 1793, at Montjouy in Barcelona, Méchain detected an inconsistency between the recorded lengths and an astronomical survey of the position of the stars. The Franco-Spanish war prevented him from repeating measurements. This difference (which was in fact not due to a handling error but the uncertainty of the instruments used) plunged him into deep trouble and he made every effort to avoid having to report on his work in Paris. In 1799, he resigned himself to attend an international conference which welcomed his scientific work. In 1798, the was created.
Under the Bourbon Restoration, the (regarding the murder of Antoine Bernardin Fualdès) included a highly controversial trial and executions. Rodez received many journalists, on this occasion, who described the behaviour of Rodez people from a very subjective standpoint.

The 19th century also experienced a cultural revival. In 1836, the was founded on the initiative of . The main leaders of the department were involved in the cultural life of the province. Modernisation of Rodez occurred very slowly during the 19th century. Little by little, Rodez evolved by affirming and developing its role as capital of the department of Aveyron from the 21st century, creating its own economy and independence, whilst remaining linked to Toulouse. Thus, from this period, many facilities have appeared such as the , the development of the Rodez-Marcillac Airport platform, high-speed connections to Rodez, the &quot;Esplanade du Foirail&quot; with its multiplex cinemas, the Pierre Soulages Museum and its festival hall.

==Economy==
Rodez asserts itself from an economic and tourist perspective at the centre of a triangle formed by Toulouse at the southwest, the regional prefecture located from the Piton Ruthenois, at the southeast by Montpellier and to the north by Clermont-Ferrand, the farthest, located away.

Over the main city of the province, with 20,000 inhabitants, Rodez is, according to INSEE the 13th most prosperous urban unit of France just behind most of the cities in Île-de-France such as Saint-Cloud, Courbevoie, Paris and Suresnes. It is the 28th city where there are the most &quot;jobs on the spot&quot;, Rodez is also the 91st commune of France in terms of viable start-ups by inhabitants (1 per 116 inhabitants) and the 157th in terms of share of taxed households representing 58 per cent (well above the national average). This result can be explained by two mechanisms. First, the diversity of the economic base is that companies of Rodez touch on numerous and varied areas. Moreover, Rodez was for many years separated from the major national economies without relevant communications. To do this, it endeavoured by its own skills to produce and build its own corporate panel in order to sustain its territory.

<text>William Alfred Savage, VC (30 October 1912 – 28 March 1942) was a Royal Navy sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Savage was 29 years old, and an able seaman in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 28 March 1942, in the St. Nazaire Raid, France, Savage, who was a gun-layer of a pom-pom in MGB 314, engaged enemy positions ashore, shooting with great accuracy. Although he had no gun-shield and was in a most exposed position, he continued firing with great coolness until he was finally killed at his gun.

The official citation noted &quot;This Victoria Cross is awarded in recognition not only of the gallantry and devotion to duty of Able Seaman Savage, but also of the valour shown by many others, unnamed, in Motor Launches, Motor Gun Boats and Motor Torpedo Boats, who gallantly carried out their duty in entirely exposed positions against Enemy fire at very close range&quot;

==Legacy==
Savage&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England.

Savage Road located near Devonport Naval Base, Plymouth, Devonshire was named in his honour

<doc id="1188352" wikidata="Q7789787" url="?curid=1188352" title="Thomas Frank Durrant">
<text>Sergeant Thomas Frank Durrant VC (17 October 1918 – 28 March 1942) was a soldier in the British Army during the Second World War and a posthumous English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His award of the Victoria Cross was unique in that it is the only award given to a soldier in a naval action. It was also unusual, though not unique, in having been suggested by a German officer. (For similar cases see Lt Cdr Gerard Broadmead Roope VC RN, recommended by letter from &quot;Kapitan zur See&quot; Hellmuth Heye, commanding the German cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, and Flying Officer Lloyd Trigg VC RNZAF, recommended by &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Klemens Schamong, captain &quot;U-468&quot;.)

==Early life==
Thomas Frank Durrant was born on 17 October 1918 and lived in Green Street Green, Farnborough, Kent. He attended Green Street Green Primary School, formally known as Vine Road Primary School. After leaving school, he worked as a butcher&#x27;s boy, then as a builder&#x27;s labourer.

==Military service==
Durrant enlisted in the Corps of Royal Engineers prior to the Second World War on 1 February 1937. His service number was 1874047. In 1940 the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the formation of units of specially trained troops that would, &quot;develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast.&quot; Durrant volunteered for service with the Special Service Independent Companies and was posted to No. 2 Special Independent Company. It was when serving with No. 2 Independent Company in the Norwegian campaign that he was promoted in the field to Sergeant. When his company returned from Norway all the independent companies were formed into battalion sized units known as Commandos. Durrant then became a member of No. 1 Commando.

===St Nazaire===
The St Nazaire Raid (Operation Chariot) was a seaborne attack on the heavily defended docks of Saint-Nazaire in occupied France on the night of 28 March 1942. This was a combined operation undertaken by Royal Navy and Commando units. The main commando force was provided by No. 2 Commando with supporting demolition parties from other commando units, including Durrant&#x27;s No. 1 Commando. The intention of the raid was to destroy the dry dock which would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, to return to home waters rather than seek safe haven in the Atlantic coast. Of the 600 men who left the port of Falmouth, Cornwall, England on the raid only 225 would return.

During the raid Sergeant Durrant was in charge of a twin Lewis gun on board H.M. Motor Launch 306. As it came up the river Loire to the port of St Nazaire ML306 came under heavy fire from the shore and was unable to land its troops at the Old Mole and it is during its withdrawal that it came head-to-head with a pursuing German destroyer of the Mowe class, the &quot;Jaguar&quot;. In the battle with the German destroyer Durrant was wounded numerous times, in the head, both arms, legs, chest and stomach. After the battle Durrant died of his wounds in a German military hospital in St Nazaire. Following his death he was buried in La Baule-Escoublac War Cemetery, from Saint-Nazaire, in Plot I, Row D, Grave 11. A week later the commander of the German destroyer, Kapitänleutnant F. K. Paul, met the Commando commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Augustus Newman, in a prisoner of war camp in Rennes. Bringing the action to Newman&#x27;s attention, Paul suggested that the colonel might wish to recommend Durrant for a high award.

His Victoria Cross citation reads:
==Aftermath==
Durrant is buried in La Baule-Escoublac War Cemetery, France in Plot I, Row D, Grave 11.

The award of the Victoria Cross to Durrant was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 15 June 1945, at the same time it was announced the Commando commander during the raid Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman had also been awarded the Victoria Cross. On 29 October 1946 Durrant&#x27;s Victoria Cross was presented to his mother at an investiture at Buckingham Palace by King George VI. Durrant&#x27;s Victoria Cross is now on display at the Royal Engineers Museum Prince Arthur Road, Gillingham, Kent, England.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman, (19 August 1904 – 26 April 1972) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Newman was educated at Bancroft&#x27;s School, Essex. On leaving school he joined a firm of Civil Engineering and Public Works Contractors and was commissioned into the part-time Territorial Army in 1925, rising to the rank of major by 1939.

He was 37 years old and a lieutenant colonel in The Essex Regiment, British Army, attached to No. 2 Commando during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 28 March 1942 in the attack on St. Nazaire, France, Lieutenant Colonel Newman was in charge of the military forces and he was one of the first ashore, leading his men and directing operations &quot;utterly regardless of his own safety&quot;, according to his citation. Under his inspiring leadership the troops held vastly superior numbers of the enemy at bay until the demolition parties had done their work. &quot;he outstanding gallantry and devotion to duty of this fearless officer, his brilliant leadership and initiative, were largely responsible for the success of this perilous operation&quot;, the citation noted. The colonel then attempted to fight through into open country and not until all the ammunition was spent were he and his men overwhelmed and taken prisoner.

==Subsequent career==
After the Second World War, Newman continued in the Territorial Army, subsequently commanding 21 (Artists) Special Air Service Regiment. He served as Deputy Lieutenant of Essex, 1946 to 1948. On 1 October 1959 he was appointed Major in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps. 

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Errol Dunkley (born 6 February 1951), sometimes spelled Erroll Dunkley, is a Jamaican reggae musician, born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1951.

==Biography==
Dunkley&#x27;s recording career began in 1965, when he was 14, with &quot;Gypsy&quot; (a duet with Roy Shirley) for Linden Pottinger&#x27;s Gaydisc label, &quot;My Queen&quot; (with Junior English) for Prince Buster, and &quot;Love Me Forever&quot; on the Rio label. From 1967 to 1968, he recorded several singles for Joe Gibbs, including &quot;Please Stop Your Lying&quot; (1967) and &quot;Love Brother&quot; (1968), before switching to Coxsone Dodd in 1969. 

In the early 1970s, with Gregory Isaacs, he formed the African Museum record label. Isaacs soon took sole control of the label, and Dunkley formed Silver Ring, a new label. In 1972, he teamed up with producer Jimmy Radway for two of his most popular singles, &quot;Keep the Pressure Down&quot; and &quot;Black Cinderella&quot;. The same year saw the release of Dunkley&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Presenting Errol Dunkley&quot;, produced by Sonia Pottinger, which included the track &quot;A Little Way Different&quot;.

Dunkley continued to record throughout the 1970s and toward the end of the decade his popularity in the UK grew, resulting in a breakthrough UK Singles Chart hit in 1979 with &quot;OK Fred&quot;, a cover version of a song written by John Holt, that reached number 11. His 1980 release &quot;Sit Down And Cry&quot; also reached the charts.

Dunkley re-recorded &quot;OK Fred&quot;, his biggest hit, in 1996 with Queen Sister *N*.

<doc id="1188373" wikidata="Q2908839" url="?curid=1188373" title="Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress">
<text>Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress is a rotating theater audio-animatronic stage show attraction in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, just outside of Orlando. Created by Walt Disney and WED Enterprises as the prime feature of the General Electric (GE) Pavilion for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the attraction was moved to Tomorrowland at Disneyland in Anaheim, California as Carousel of Progress, and remained there from 1967 until 1973. It was replaced in Disneyland by America Sings in 1974, and reopened in its present home in the Magic Kingdom in 1975.

Steeped in both nostalgia and futurism, the attraction&#x27;s premise is an exploration of the joys of living through the advent of electricity and other technological advances during the 20th century via a &quot;typical&quot; American family. To keep it current with the times, the attraction has been updated five times (in 1967, 1975, 1981, 1985, and 1994), and has had two theme songs, both written by the Sherman Brothers, Disney&#x27;s Academy Award-winning songwriting team.

The Carousel of Progress holds the record as the longest-running stage show in the history of American theater. It is one of the oldest attractions in the Walt Disney World Resort. It is also the oldest attraction at Walt Disney World to have been worked on by Walt Disney.

==Summary==
===Intro===
The attraction begins with a brief introduction about Walt Disney&#x27;s idea for the attraction&#x27;s debut at the 1964-1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair and how he always had a passion for progress. Regarded as the longest-running stage show in American theater history, the theater then begins to rotate for each act to the theme song &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; by the Sherman Brothers.

===Act 1: Turn of the Century (1900s)===
The first act is set on Valentine’s Day, &quot;right around the turn of the century&quot;. The father of the family, John, is sitting on a wooden rocking chair in his home, his dog, Rover, lying on the floor. He mentions that two brothers in North Carolina are working on a &quot;flying contraption&quot; but comments it will never work, followed by mentions of the new inventions and technological achievements of the day. After he shows off the new technology, he calls to his wife, Sarah, who is ironing in the room to John&#x27;s right. The two discuss how Thomas Edison is working on an idea for &quot;snap-on electric lights&quot;, to which Sarah comments &quot;no more kerosene, no more gas&quot; will be needed to illuminate rooms.

She also shows her new &quot;wash-day marvel&quot; that helps her do laundry in five hours, instead of two days, and she needs to get the laundry off the line before it starts raining. John initially denies that it is about to rain as his lumbago hasn&#x27;t acted up, but is immediately proven wrong. Shortly after, the family&#x27;s son, James, begins to talk from the right room and is scolded for using his father’s Stereoscope without permission. James is watching Little Egypt dancing the &quot;Hootchie-Cootchie&quot;. John comments that she is going to be the star of the upcoming World&#x27;s Fair, and that James better put the Stereoscope away before his mother finds it. As John and James finish talking, John tells talks about owning &quot;one of those new talking machines&quot;, after which, the family’s grandmother appears on the left room, having fallen asleep while listening to the phonograph. John&#x27;s attention is then drawn to a room on the right, where his daughter, Patricia, is getting ready to go to a Valentine’s Day dance on the other side of town. John explains that she will be taking one of the new &quot;horseless trolleys&quot;, before telling her that she better be home by 9 o&#x27;clock. He then mentions he&#x27;s going to take one of the said trolleys downtown to have a root beer, which he explains is just a sarsaparilla with a new name.

===Act 2: 1920s===
The second act is set in the &quot;Roarin&#x27; Twenties&quot;. John is once again sitting in his kitchen, this time on a smaller kitchen chair on Independence Day. Wires and new electric machines are all over the room. He says things have changed a lot in the last twenty years. He proceeds to tell guests the new accomplishments of the era, such as Charles Lindbergh about to fly over the Atlantic Ocean, sports stadiums being built all over the United States, regarding Babe Ruth as the country&#x27;s best baseball player, advertisements for a film, where Al Jolson will talk and sing, electric starters replacing cranks in automobiles, and travel time from New York to California in three days.

John then tells guests that Thomas Edison has brought electricity to his home, after which, the electrical appliances all turn on at the same time, blowing up a fuse, shutting the power in the house and the neighborhood. John then tells his son, Jimmy, to go put in a new fuse and power is restored. John&#x27;s wife, Sarah, who is sitting on the front porch, is sewing a George Washington costume for John to wear to the town&#x27;s Independence Day celebration, as her Ladies Club is in charge of the festivities. John tells the guests that the whole family will be performing in their presentation, with John and Sarah going as George and Martha Washington. Sarah is happy electric lights can be installed on the porch. Sarah tells John that Jimmy has volunteered to pick the music for the celebration. Jimmy then appears with his grandfather in the left room, dressed in a colonial outfit and standing next to a radio, which is playing patriotic music.

John tells guests that they can now get news and entertainment on their radio from all over the country. The radio programming announces crowds have begun gathering downtown for the 4th of July. After hearing this, John rushes his daughter, Patricia, to get ready. Patricia is sitting in a room on the right, wearing a Statue of Liberty costume, worrying her new boyfriend will be scared away if he sees her in her costume. John then mentions the house now has indoor plumbing which is great for cold days, especially for Uncle Orville, who is shown sitting in a bathtub on the left side of the stage. John informs guests that he has set up an air cooling system next to the bathtub, with a fan sitting in front of a block of ice, blowing on him.

===Act 3: 1940s===
The third act is set on Halloween during the &quot;Fabulous Forties&quot;. John is wearing a sweater while sitting at a circular booth-style kitchen table. New kitchen technologies include a refrigerator that holds more quantity of food and ice cubes and an automatic dishwasher. John mentions he is now part of the &quot;rat race&quot; and they now have television, when it works, and that John Cameron Swayze brings the news every night.

The grandparents then appear on the right room, where the grandfather is sleeping and the grandmother changes the television channel to boxing. A now teenage Jim calls from his room and asks for his father&#x27;s opinion on the Jack-O-Lantern he carved, to which John says it&#x27;s scary; Jim remarks he used his &quot;beautiful sister Patty&quot; as a model. Patty is seen on the right room using an old exercise machine that was &quot;all the rage in the twenties&quot;, while talking on the phone about her date for that night. After this, John tells the audience that he is caught up in the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; craze as they are redoing their basement and making it into a rumpus room. On the left room, Sarah is putting up wallpaper using a &quot;paint mixer&quot; that John says he made for her, using Sarah&#x27;s food mixer. As John admires his handiwork, the paint mixer goes haywire and shoots paint everywhere.

===Act 4: 21st century===
The fourth and final act is set during Christmas in the 21st century, with the family gathered in the living room and kitchen. John is standing in the kitchen, where he is working on Christmas dinner while Sarah is working on her computer nearby. A now-young-adult Jim and his grandmother are playing a virtual reality game while a 20-something Trish and her grandfather sit around the Christmas tree. Sarah tells John that she has programmed the oven to recognize his voice. John comments that all of the household items are now voice-automated, and Sarah demonstrates this by requesting that the Christmas tree lights be brightened. She then asks John to try the voice-activated oven, which he does with no problem as it confirms John&#x27;s temperature command.

The grandmother has reached a score of 550 points in the virtual reality game, impressing both John and James, who repeat the score in awe. Upon hearing John say 550 aloud, the oven increases its temperature, although nobody seems to notice. The grandfather then remarks that he cannot believe the new gadgets that people have today. Between Trish and her grandfather, new technologies have arisen such as car phones, laser discs, high-def TVs, and automated plumbing. When the grandmother gets a high score of 975, John repeats the number out loud in front of the oven, unintentionally causing it to overheat and begin to smoke and blare warning noises before opening the door to show a severely burned and blackened turkey. John jokes that maybe in the new century, ovens will learn to read minds.

==History==
===Edison Square concept===
In the late 1950s, after Disneyland&#x27;s initial success, Walt Disney planned to expand the Main Street, U.S.A. area with two districts, International Street and Edison Square. In Edison Square, guests would see a show called &quot;Harnessing the Lighting&quot;. Hosted by an &quot;electro-mechanical&quot; man named Wilbur K. Watt, it would chronicle the evolution of electricity in the home from the late 19th century to the present and beyond, and show how much electrical appliances—specifically, GE appliances—had benefited American life. After each time period, or &quot;act&quot;, was over, the audience would get up and walk to the next one. The idea was eventually scrapped.

The Main Street expansion idea fell by the wayside. One reason was that technology wasn&#x27;t yet available to achieve what Disney wanted. However, the idea stayed in Disney&#x27;s mind for the next few years. GE still wanted to work with Disney, but a better outlet was needed.

===1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair===

General Electric approached Walt Disney to develop a show for the company&#x27;s pavilion at the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Disney leapt at the chance to rekindle his relationship with GE, who would fund the project and the new technology necessary to bring it to life. Reaching back to the Edison Square concept, he again pitched the idea of an electrical progress show to GE executives, who loved it.

During the planning phase, Disney&#x27;s Imagineers perfected the Audio-Animatronics (AA) technology necessary to operate the &quot;performers&quot; in the show, using technologies similar to those in Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room and Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, another attraction designed by Disney for the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The Imagineers, led by Disney engineers Roger E. Broggie and Bob Gurr, also devised a &quot;carousel theater&quot;, so that the audience could stay seated and ride around a stationary set of stages, instead of getting up and walking from stage to stage. This allowed the audience to remain comfortably in place during scene changes, avoiding time-consuming disruptions between acts.

Singing cowboy Rex Allen was tapped to voice Father, the host and narrator that replaced the original &quot;Wilbur K. Watt&quot; character. Allen later commented that he did not know exactly what he was getting into.

Walt Disney asked songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman to create a song to bridge the &quot;acts&quot; in the show. When he explained what the show was about, they decided to write a song based on Disney&#x27;s enthusiasm, titled &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot;. The brothers later said that they considered it Walt&#x27;s &quot;theme song,&quot; because he was so optimistic and excited about the future and technology itself.

The show opened at the Fair as Progressland, and was one of its most popular pavilions. Though more than 200 people entered and exited the attraction every four minutes, it was not uncommon to wait over an hour in line. For the Fair&#x27;s 1965 season, a massive covered queue was constructed next to the pavilion on an empty lot to protect visitors from New York&#x27;s hot summer sun. The Carousel was also the first Disney ride with a sign that dynamically displayed wait times.

At the end of the Carousel show, fairgoers were invited to walk up to the second floor of the pavilion and see the General Electric &quot;Skydome Spectacular&quot;. The &quot;Skydome Spectacular&quot; projected images of nature and energy into the domed roof of the GE pavilion, similar to a planetarium. The show demonstrated the many ways that GE was harnessing electricity and the power of the sun for the benefit of its customers. At the end of the Spectacular, in the first demonstration of controlled thermonuclear fusion to be witnessed by a large general audience, a magnetic field squeezed a plasma of deuterium gas for a few millionths of a second at a temperature of 20 million degrees Fahrenheit. There was a vivid flash and a loud report as atoms collided, creating free energy that was evidenced on instruments. The temperature listed in the 1964 guidebook was 20 million degrees F; in the 1965 guide the temperature was up to 50 million degrees F.

===Disneyland===

The Carousel of Progress reopened at Disneyland Park on July 2, 1967, with only small differences from the World&#x27;s Fair version. It opened nearly seven months after Walt&#x27;s death, as part of the New Tomorrowland. Due to the success of the attractions Disney created for the Fair, General Electric agreed to sponsor the Carousel of Progress at Disneyland as well. However, the Carousel of Progress was to be a permanent fixture at Disneyland. It is unknown how many years GE would have sponsored it had it stayed there, although it is presumed the sponsorship would have lasted 10–12 years, as many other sponsors throughout Disneyland Park had.

The actual attraction was located on ground level and a new, nearly identical theater system was constructed. The sets and &quot;performers&quot; all came right from the Fair exhibit and remained in nearly their original states. A new voice was recorded for Mother; &quot;Christmas in the Home of the 1960s&quot; was slightly updated in set design and technology; all references to General Electric&#x27;s passé &quot;Medallion Home&quot; campaign were dropped; and Father from &quot;The Home of the 1940s&quot; now sat on a bar stool rather than on the kitchen nook bench.

After the show, guests boarded an inclined moving walkway to the building&#x27;s second level, where a 4-minute post-show, narrated by Mother and Father (with a few barks and growls from their dog) coincided with a view of an enormous animated model of Progress City, based on Walt Disney&#x27;s original concept for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT) and the Walt Disney World property.

As the 1970s rolled in, the Carousel of Progress saw dwindling audiences. GE thought they were not getting the most for their advertising dollars, surmising that 80% of the people that saw the attraction were Californians who had seen it many times. GE asked Disney to move the show to their new Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. The Disneyland show closed on September 9, 1973, and was packed up for Florida. The Progress City model was disassembled and portions of the center of it were reassembled in Florida.

Disneyland soon incorporated The Carousel Theater into its plans to celebrate America&#x27;s Bicentennial. In 1974 it was filled with a new show called America Sings, a salute to American music. It closed in 1988, and was not replaced for ten years. Innoventions, a version of the popular Epcot attraction of the same name, opened there with the New Tomorrowland in 1998, using a stylized rendition of &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; as its theme song. The building was then redesigned and reopened in 2015 as the Tomorrowland Expo Center, hosting the Star Wars Launch Bay.

===Magic Kingdom===

Carousel of Progress opened in the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Tomorrowland on January 15, 1975, alongside Space Mountain, under a 10-year sponsorship contract with General Electric. Unlike the small changes that occurred when the show moved from the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair to Disneyland, extensive changes were made.

A new carousel theater building was designed to house the attraction: a one-story pavilion, with a loft above it used by the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover track, wrapping around the building&#x27;s north side. The interior and exterior of the building received new color schemes, with blue and white stripes that grew smaller and larger as the building turned. The theater also now rotated counterclockwise, rather than clockwise like the two former theater systems.

The load and unload theaters no longer featured the stunning &quot;Kaleidophonic Screens&quot; that had dazzled guests as they boarded and exited their respective theater. The old screens had stretched from one wall to the other, with the giant GE logo in the center, and lit up in various colors and patterns like a kaleidoscope as the orchestral version of &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; played. Various problems plagued the screens after 1973, so a set of generic silver curtains with colored lights shining on the GE logo took their place in both the load and unload theaters.

The Florida version was planned so that guests loaded and unloaded on the first floor, without a post-show. The Progress City/EPCOT model was significantly downsized to fit in a window display that could be seen while riding PeopleMover. This display is located on the left side of the PeopleMover track inside the north show building which formerly housed Stitch&#x27;s Great Escape!

GE wanted the attraction to have a new theme song, as they did not want their customers to wait for a &quot;great big beautiful tomorrow&quot;, but to buy appliances today. So the Sherman Brothers created a new song, &quot;The Best Time Of Your Life&quot;. Although it was very peppy and positive, the brothers later said that they felt that &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; was a better fit.

A new cast of voices and audio-animatronic &quot;performers&quot; were prepared for the 1975 version, including actor Andrew Duggan as Father. The first three acts had some cosmetic and set-design changes. The finale was changed to &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve in the Home of the 1970s,&quot; and the breed of the family&#x27;s dog was also changed.

In 1981, a new final act was created to showcase &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve in the Home of the 1980s&quot;; the rest of the show remained the same. The attraction closed briefly for the change to be implemented.

===Post–GE years===

On March 10, 1985, General Electric&#x27;s contract expired and the company chose not to renew. The attraction closed shortly thereafter so that all GE references could be removed. The external GE logo was replaced with a design of a blueprint of the six carousel theaters surrounding the six fixed stages. The GE logo on the silver curtain was covered with a round sign with the blueprint logo and the name &quot;Carousel of Progress&quot;. The GE logo still exists on several household appliances throughout the attraction, such as the refrigerator in Act 3.

On August 16, 1993, the attraction closed and many blueprints at the time showed a new &quot;Flying Saucers&quot; ride inside the show building. It was eventually decided to update the Carousel of Progress to better reflect the theme of the New Tomorrowland: &quot;The Future that Never Was.&quot; Gears and other mechanical symbols were prominently featured throughout New Tomorrowland, so the Carousel of Progress theater was redesigned to feature them. The attraction and show were renamed Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress. A giant cog-design sign, &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress&quot;, replaced the blueprint sign in the load and unload theaters, and the final scene was updated to &quot;Christmas in the House of 2000&quot; as it was envisioned in 1994. A new voice cast was hired, with American writer, raconteur and radio personality Jean Shepherd as John, the family&#x27;s father, as well as the ride&#x27;s narrator. Additionally, Rex Allen, the voice of the father at the original Disneyland attraction, played Grandfather in Act 4. A four-minute pre-show about the attraction&#x27;s creation played on monitors while guests waited in line. A contemporary version of &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; returned as the attraction&#x27;s theme song. The attraction reopened on November 23, 1994, and was the first updated attraction for the New Tomorrowland, which was unveiled in phases. Since then, it has undergone many slight mechanical and cosmetic changes.

Due to a decrease in attendance following the September 11 attacks, Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress closed in October 2001. It reopened soon afterwards on a seasonal basis, causing fans to become concerned for its future. Although numerous &quot;permanent closure&quot; rumors still plague the attraction, Disney has consistently said that there are no plans for permanent closure or any closure at all. It has had minor refurbishments in recent years, but has remained open nearly every day of the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s regular operations since 2003.

The Sherman Brothers write in their joint autobiography regarding the history of the pavilion:

On July 22, 2016, the gears-and-cogs paint scheme was replaced by futuristic &quot;strikes&quot; of various different colors. The attraction&#x27;s name is now painted on the rotating part of the building.

In 2022, the animatronics in the final act got an updated wardrobe, with a few Easter eggs. For example, Trish, the daughter now wears a collegiate sweater for &quot;Progress Tech School of Urban Planning&quot;, in reference to Progress City, the model city that Walt had in mind for Epcot. Both Trish and Jim are now wearing slippers with designs of the reindeer characters from the Disney Christmas parade. James, the son, wears a ski hoodie with a logo for the Mineral King Ski Resort, an abandoned idea that Walt had planned before his death, emblazoned on it. And John, the father, now wears a green apron that reads &quot;My Food Rocks&quot;, in reference to the closed Epcot attraction &quot;Food Rocks&quot;. The dialogue, however, remains unchanged.

==Cast (1994 version)==
==Soundtrack==

The entire soundtrack for the Disneyland version (1967–1973) can be heard on &quot;A Musical History of Disneyland&quot; (2005). The soundtrack was also released as part of the 5-disc CD set &quot;Walt Disney and the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair&quot; released on March 24, 2009, which includes instrumental versions of &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; representing different eras of progress, and an early &quot;Alternate Universe&quot; version of the complete show. The complete 1975 &quot;Now is the Time&quot; version was found on Walt Disney World Forever. The current (1994) theme song of the show, &quot;There&#x27;s A Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot;, was previously available on the 2008 &quot;Four Parks – One World: Walt Disney World&quot; album and is currently available on the two-disc &quot;Walt Disney World Resort Official Album&quot; from 2013, along with other hard-to-find songs from the Walt Disney World parks.

The theme song &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow&quot; was found on a few official theme park albums over the years, including:
* &quot;Walt Disney World Resort: The Official Album&quot; (1999) (Magic Kingdom 1994 version)
* &quot;Walt Disney World Resort: Official Album&quot; (2000) (Magic Kingdom 1994 version)

<text>In computability theory, a Turing reduction from a decision problem formula_1 to a decision problem formula_2 is an oracle machine that decides problem formula_1 given an oracle for formula_2 (Rogers 1967, Soare 1987) in finitely many steps. It can be understood as an algorithm that could be used to solve formula_1 if it had access to a subroutine for solving formula_2. The concept can be analogously applied to function problems.

If a Turing reduction from formula_1 to formula_2 exists, then every algorithm for formula_2 can be used to produce an algorithm for formula_1, by inserting the algorithm for formula_2 at each place where the oracle machine computing formula_1 queries the oracle for formula_2. However, because the oracle machine may query the oracle a large number of times, the resulting algorithm may require more time asymptotically than either the algorithm for formula_2 or the oracle machine computing formula_1. A Turing reduction in which the oracle machine runs in polynomial time is known as a [[polynomial-time reduction#Turing reductions|Cook reduction]].

The first formal definition of relative computability, then called relative reducibility, was given by Alan Turing in 1939 in terms of oracle machines. Later in 1943 and 1952 Stephen Kleene defined an equivalent concept in terms of recursive functions. In 1944 Emil Post used the term &quot;Turing reducibility&quot; to refer to the concept.

== Definition ==

Given two sets formula_16 of natural numbers, we say formula_1 is Turing reducible to formula_2 and write
:formula_19
if and only if there is an oracle machine that computes the characteristic function of &quot;A&quot; when run with oracle &quot;B&quot;. In this case, we also say &quot;A&quot; is B&quot;-recursive and B&quot;-computable.

If there is an oracle machine that, when run with oracle &quot;B&quot;, computes a partial function with domain &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is said to be B&quot;-recursively enumerable and B&quot;-computably enumerable.

We say formula_1 is Turing equivalent to formula_2 and write formula_22 if both formula_19 and formula_24 The equivalence classes of Turing equivalent sets are called Turing degrees. The Turing degree of a set formula_25 is written formula_26.

Given a set formula_27, a set formula_28 is called Turing hard for formula_29 if formula_30 for all formula_31. If additionally formula_32 then formula_1 is called Turing complete for formula_29.

===Relation of Turing completeness to computational universality===
Turing completeness, as just defined above, corresponds only partially to Turing completeness in the sense of computational universality. Specifically, a Turing machine is a universal Turing machine if its halting problem (i.e., the set of inputs for which it eventually halts) is many-one complete for the set formula_29 of recursively enumerable sets. Thus, a necessary &quot;but insufficient&quot; condition for a machine to be computationally universal, is that the machine&#x27;s halting problem be Turing-complete for formula_29. Insufficient because it may still be the case that, the language accepted by the machine is not itself recursively enumerable.

== Example ==

Let formula_37 denote the set of input values for which the Turing machine with index &quot;e&quot; halts. Then the sets formula_38 and formula_39 are Turing equivalent (here formula_40 denotes an effective pairing function). A reduction showing formula_19 can be constructed using the fact that formula_42. Given a pair formula_43, a new index formula_44 can be constructed using the smn theorem such that the program coded by formula_44 ignores its input and merely simulates the computation of the machine with index &quot;e&quot; on input &quot;n&quot;. In particular, the machine with index formula_44 either halts on every input or halts on no input. Thus formula_47 holds for all &quot;e&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. Because the function &quot;i&quot; is computable, this shows formula_48. The reductions presented here are not only Turing reductions but &quot;many-one reductions&quot;, discussed below.

== Properties ==

* Every set is Turing equivalent to its complement.
* Every computable set is Turing reducible to every other set. Because any computable set can be computed with no oracle, it can be computed by an oracle machine that ignores the given oracle.
* The relation formula_49 is transitive: if formula_19 and formula_51 then formula_52. Moreover, formula_53 holds for every set &quot;A&quot;, and thus the relation formula_49 is a preorder (it is not a partial order because formula_19 and formula_56 does not necessarily imply formula_57).
* There are pairs of sets formula_58 such that &quot;A&quot; is not Turing reducible to &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is not Turing reducible to &quot;A&quot;. Thus formula_49 is not a total order.
* There are infinite decreasing sequences of sets under formula_49. Thus this relation is not well-founded.
* Every set is Turing reducible to its own Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set.

== The use of a reduction ==

Since every reduction from a set formula_1 to a set formula_2 has to determine whether a single element is in formula_1 in only finitely many steps, it can only make finitely many queries of membership in the set formula_2. When the amount of information about the set formula_2 used to compute a single bit of formula_1 is discussed, this is made precise by the &quot;use&quot; function. Formally, the &quot;use&quot; of a reduction is the function that sends each natural number formula_67 to the largest natural number formula_68 whose membership in the set formula_2 was queried by the reduction while determining the membership of formula_67 in formula_1.

== Stronger reductions ==

There are two common ways of producing reductions stronger than Turing reducibility. The first way is to limit the number and manner of oracle queries. 
* Set formula_1 is many-one reducible to formula_2 if there is a total computable function formula_74 such that an element formula_67 is in formula_1 if and only if formula_77 is in formula_2. Such a function can be used to generate a Turing reduction (by computing formula_77, querying the oracle, and then interpreting the result).
* A truth table reduction or a weak truth table reduction must present all of its oracle queries at the same time. In a truth table reduction, the reduction also gives a boolean function (a truth table) that, when given the answers to the queries, will produce the final answer of the reduction. In a weak truth table reduction, the reduction uses the oracle answers as a basis for further computation depending on the given answers (but not using the oracle). Equivalently, a weak truth table reduction is one for which the use of the reduction is bounded by a computable function. For this reason, weak truth table reductions are sometimes called &quot;bounded Turing&quot; reductions.

The second way to produce a stronger reducibility notion is to limit the computational resources that the program implementing the Turing reduction may use. These limits on the computational complexity of the reduction are important when studying subrecursive classes such as P. A set &quot;A&quot; is polynomial-time reducible to a set formula_2 if there is a Turing reduction of formula_1 to formula_2 that runs in polynomial time. The concept of log-space reduction is similar.

These reductions are stronger in the sense that they provide a finer distinction into equivalence classes, and satisfy more restrictive requirements than Turing reductions. Consequently, such reductions are harder to find. There may be no way to build a many-one reduction from one set to another even when a Turing reduction for the same sets exists.

== Weaker reductions ==

According to the Church–Turing thesis, a Turing reduction is the most general form of an effectively calculable reduction. Nevertheless, weaker reductions are also considered. Set formula_1 is said to be arithmetical in formula_2 if formula_1 is definable by a formula of Peano arithmetic with formula_2 as a parameter. The set formula_1 is hyperarithmetical in formula_2 if there is a recursive ordinal formula_89 such that formula_1 is computable from formula_91, the &quot;α&quot;-iterated Turing jump of formula_2. The notion of relative constructibility is an important reducibility notion in set theory.

<text>Stradbroke ( ) is an English village in the Mid Suffolk district of the county of Suffolk. The census of 2011 gave the parish a population of 1,408, with an estimate of 1,513 in 2018.

==Heritage==
The village was listed in the Domesday Book of 1096 as being in the Bishop&#x27;s Hundred, later renamed Hoxne Hundred. The village name was sometimes spelt Stradbrook in the Middle Ages and in local documents as late as the early 19th century.

A post-medieval source states that the prominent medieval philosopher Robert Grosseteste, also Bishop of Lincoln, was born in Stradbroke in about 1175, but there is no medieval evidence to confirm this. Its parish church of All Saints, with a 15th-century tower and a raised stair turret, dominates the village as a landmark.

In October 2014 the state primary school marked the 150th anniversary of its predecessor&#x27;s opening on 28 September 1864.

The village used to host a Navy Day on the last Saturday in July, to mourn the end of the Royal Navy&#x27;s rum ration in July 1970. as part of the celebration a tot of rum was processed round the village. The last such event was held in 2007.

==Amenities==
Stradbroke&#x27;s position as a centre for smaller villages and hamlets means it has more facilities than its population might suggest. It serves as an education centre for Mid Suffolk, with a primary school and a high school in the village.

There are two pubs, several shops, and local services that include a public library, a community centre, a swimming pool and a gym. It has a playing field for cricket and football, three tennis courts, two bowling greens and a fitness track. The village includes some of public footpaths, maintained by local government two or three times a year. Near the community centre there is a doctor&#x27;s surgery and a play area for young children. At Westhall there is another play area and a recreation ground for informal games.

The village post office reopened in 2014 in the local library, housed in the historic courthouse building. The previous post office in a shop had closed. Library staff work on both the post office and library counters. The village shop was refurbished in 2014. There is also a bakery, a butcher&#x27;s shop, a wedding shop, and an antiques centre and cafe.

In 2012 a field of was bought on Drapers Hill and 28 allotment gardens laid out, along with a community orchard and wild flower meadow. A pond was donated at the top of the site, overlooked by donated public seats. There are views of the church towards the centre of the village.

Stradbroke has a free magazine, the &quot;Stradbroke Monthly&quot;, and an online community radio station, Radio Stradbroke. The Stradisphere Festival was an annual music event held between 2013 and 2018 in the village featuring acts including Badly Drawn Boy.

==Transport==
Stradbroke lies midway between Norwich and Ipswich on the B1117 and B1118 secondary roads, some 7 miles (11 km) from the Suffolk town of Eye and 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Norfolk market town of Diss, where the village&#x27;s nearest railway station is located. Train services from Diss take an hour and a half to reach London. There is a limited public school bus service linking Stradbroke to Eye, Framlingham and Ipswich.

==Notable people==
In birth order: 
*Robert Grosseteste (c. 1175–1253), scholar and Bishop of Lincoln, is said to have been born in Stradbroke.

<doc id="1188399" wikidata="Q1758385" url="?curid=1188399" title="Corvette K-225">
<text>Corvette K-225 is a 1943 American war film starring Randolph Scott and James Brown, with Ella Raines making her feature film debut. Directed by Richard Rosson, the film was released in the UK as The Nelson Touch. Robert Mitchum, credited as Bob Mitchum, had a minor supporting role, one of 20 Hollywood films he made in 1943. Tony Gaudio was nominated for the 1943 Academy Award for Best Cinematography (B&amp;W) for his work on &quot;Corvette K -225&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1943 at the height of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Royal Canadian Navy Lieutenant Commander MacClain has just lost his ship and most of his crewmen due to enemy action. While accompanying a convoy, he was attacked by a U-boat with a distinctive large Iron Cross painted on the conning tower. The U-boat surfaced and machine-gunned many of the survivors. Offered duty ashore, MacClain is determined to avenge his men. He is allocated a new ship and while waiting for it to be built befriends Joyce Cartwright, whose brother Dick, an officer, was killed under his command.

MacClain&#x27;s new Flower-class corvette is christened as HMCS &quot;Donnacona&quot;, and soon a crew of 65, including officer Paul Cartwright, Joyce&#x27;s younger brother, is assigned to the ship. Setting out as an escort to a convoy heading for England, the &quot;Donnacona&quot; comes upon the grisly sight of a lifeboat filled with dead sailors, the result of a deadly U-boat attack.

In an ocean storm, his ship is separated from the convoy, but 300 miles from the Irish coast MacClain finds other lost ships that had also been separated from their escorts. The captain of the tanker &quot;Egyptian Star&quot; relays the information that he thinks a submarine has been trailing him. The small group of ships then becomes the target of Luftwaffe bombers that are chased off by a Fleet Air Arm Hawker Hurricane fighter launched from one of the escort ships. The submarines below are still the main concern and when the &quot;Egyptian Star&quot; is torpedoed and sunk, MacClain attacks, sinking a U-boat with depth charges.

Another U-boat surfaces and in a running battle badly damages the &quot;Donnacona&quot;. The U-boat is damaged by deck gun fire from the corvette. MacClain attempts to ram the submarine and when it begins to dive, depth charges are fired, sinking it. As it breaks up MacClain recognizes it as the one which had machine-gunned his former crew.

The corvette, along with six surviving merchant ships, limps to safety in Ireland. Before it sets anchor MacClain is asked to sail the &quot;Donnacona&quot; past the other ships in the harbor so that its crew may be saluted for their bravery.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Corvette K-225&quot; was produced under the working title of &quot;Corvettes in Action&quot; between February 4 and early May 1943. While much of the film was made on a sound stage, parts of it, notably an outdoor scene at the University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax, were filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where many of the corvettes were stationed and where many transatlantic convoys were gathered and deployed. Over a three-month period in 1943 camera crews accompanied five convoys in order to gather background footage.

As its location was a wartime secret, Halifax is referred to as &quot;Hannington Harbour&quot; in the film. The scenes of the shipyard were filmed at Toronto, Ontario; the Maple Leaf Mills grain elevator at the foot of Spadina Avenue is visible in a few scenes. &quot;Corvette K -225&quot; featured a fictional ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS &quot;Donnacona&quot;, which was played by HMCS &quot;Kitchener&quot; (K225). HMCS Kitchener served like the fictional Donnacona on Atlantic convoy escort in World War 2. She was decommissioned in 1945 and scrapped in 1949. Incidentally the real HMCS Donnacona is a currently operating RCN Naval Reserve establishment in Montreal where RCN members are trained and after which the fictional ship was named.

Before final casts were announced, Robert Stack, Dick Foran, Diana Barrymore, Evelyn Ankers, Jon Hall, Nigel Bruce and Patric Knowles were considered by Howard Hawks. In the June 11, 1942 issue of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Robert Rosson was to be the second unit director on the film, shooting 10 days on location in the Atlantic with a convoy, and Hawks was going to direct, as well as produce. Screenwriter Lt. John Rhodes Sturdy, the commanding officer of a Canadian corvette, was also assigned to the film for five weeks as a technical advisor, loaned to the production by Royal Canadian Navy Public Affairs.

The start of the film features Lieutenant Commander MaClain and his survivors from his previous ship on board a V&amp;W class destroyer. The V&amp;W-class were former Royal Navy fleet destroyers which had been transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Canadian Navy for escort duty. They were built between 1918 and 1925.

==Reception==
The world premiere of &quot;Corvette K-225&quot; was held on October 19, 1943 at the Central Theatre in Ottawa, Canada, with the proceeds being donated to the Navy League of Canada. Film critic Bosley Crowther reviewed the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating, &quot;Randolph Scott gives a beautiful performance ...&quot; but most of the review focused on the drama of the RCN corvettes at sea, &quot;In a virtually documentary treatment of life aboard the K-225, Producer Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson, director of the film, have realized the physical strain and torment of work in a rampant corvette. They have pictured with indubitable fidelity the discomforts of an escort vessel&#x27;s crew—the eternal tossing and rolling of the ship in a moderate sea; her plunging and gyrating in the grip of a North Atlantic gale, with tons of sea water pouring over her, battering and soaking every man.&quot;

<text>The League of Struggle for Negro Rights was organized by the Communist Party in 1930 as the successor to the American Negro Labor Congress. The League was particularly active in organizing support for the &quot;Scottsboro Boys&quot;, nine black men sentenced to death in 1931 for crimes they had not committed. It also campaigned for a separate black nation in the South, one of the CPUSA&#x27;s principal tenets in the early 1930s, and against police brutality, the Italian occupation of Ethiopia and Jim Crow laws, while also advocating a more general policy of opposition to fascism and support for the Soviet Union.

Langston Hughes became its President in 1934. Harry Haywood was its General Secretary. Another prominent leader of the organization was Bonita Williams, a migrant from the British Caribbean living in Harlem, who joined the group after abandoning Garveyism. During her time with the league, Williams organized &quot;&#x27;Flying Squads,&#x27; which mobilized working-class housewives to agitate against high food prices.&quot;

The organization largely disappeared after 1935, when the Communist Party, as part of its Popular Front strategy, joined with other non-communist organizations and individuals to form the National Negro Congress.

<doc id="1188428" wikidata="Q5445264" url="?curid=1188428" title="Ferrari Dino engine">
<text>The Ferrari Dino engine is a line of mechanically similar V6 and V8 engines produced by Ferrari for about 40 years from the late 1950s into the early 2000s.

The idea for the engine came from Alfredo &quot;Dino&quot; Ferrari, who was the son of Enzo Ferrari. Dino suggested to Enzo Ferrari the development of a V6 engine for F2 at the end of 1955. Soon afterwards, Alfredo fell gravely ill, and he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. While hospitalized, he discussed technical details about the engine with a recently hired engineer named Vittorio Jano. Dino would never live to see the engine; he died on June 30, 1956, at the age of 24.

The Dino V6 was Ferrari&#x27;s first V6 engine. The Dino V8 engine was introduced later; the latter used a flat-plane crankshaft configuration.

==V6==

The production Dino V6 began as a discussion between Vittorio Jano and Enzo and Dino Ferrari about the ideal 1.5 L engine for use in the 1957 Formula Two auto racing series. Jano, formerly of Alfa Romeo and Lancia, pressed for a conventional 60° V6 but the Ferraris were open-minded.

===60°===
Jano&#x27;s 60° design incorporated some of his ideas from the Lancia Aurelia, and were used in a number of Formula One, Formula Two, and Grand Prix cars from 1959 through the early 1960s. Appearing in 1958, it used a bore and stroke for and produced in the 196 S. A larger version was also produced, the Dino 246 S. These engines continued in the 1962 Ferrari 196 SP and 286 SP. The latter had a bore and stroke of for and .

===65°===
Ferrari designers began work on the first Dino V6 engine in 1956 and the engine was running by the end of the year. The engine displaced . This engine was installed in the Dino 156 F2 car and was first raced in the Grand Prix of Naples in April 1957, where it finished in third place behind two Lancia-Ferrari V8 Formula One cars.

The result of the trio&#x27;s creativity was the world&#x27;s only 65° V6 engine. The extra 5° between cylinder banks gave Ferrari the straight intakes he wanted. As this engine was not a true V6 but had a separate crankpin for every connecting rod, the crankpins were offset by 55 degrees within every pair of cylinders. This ensured an even firing order for the complete engine as well as an even distance between firing pulses per cylinder bank. Thus the engine was as smoothly running as a conventional 60-degree V6, but had greatly enhanced potential for the design of harmonically balanced exhaust manifolds, giving much better performance. Although the Dino V6 was discontinued with the introduction of the V8 engine in the Dino 308 GT4, the 65° design continues to this day: It reappeared on Ferrari&#x27;s 1992 456 V12.

The engine used in the 246 S produced with dual overhead camshafts pushing two valves per cylinder. The rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout 1961 Ferrari 246 SP used this same engine, as did the 246 P F1. A bigger displacement engine () with was used for the 1959 Dino 296 S. 

The 65° Dino V6 continued in racing after 1962, and made its way to the street as well. The 60° unit was no longer being developed after the SP-series. Ferrari needed to have the engine in 500 production vehicles to homologate it for racing use. The company worked with Fiat to develop a sports car to house it, and the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout Fiat Dino project was born.

In competition, the 1965 Dino 166 P used a tiny version of the 65° unit. Both bore and stroke were different from the earlier engine at and output was impressive at . Bore was up to for the version found that same year in the Dino 206 SP as well as the 1966 Dino 206 S.

In 1968, Ferrari debuted its own Dino 206 GT, the company&#x27;s first mid-engined road car. It used the 2.0 L engine from the 206 S transversely-mounted between the rear wheels. In compared with racing 206 S version the engine of road 206 GT was detuned to . After producing just 152 cars, Ferrari bumped the bore and stroke up from to for . This increased power to at 7600 rpm and at 5500 rpm, but the engine block was now made of cast iron rather than aluminium.

The same V6 engine was handed off to Lancia for use in its WRC-champ Stratos in the early 1970s, but Ferrari&#x27;s Dino had moved on to 8 cylinders.

Applications:
* 2.0 L
** 1966–1969 Fiat Dino
** 1967–1969 Dino 206 GT
* 2.4 L
** 1969–1973 Fiat Dino
** 1969–1974 Dino 246 GT and GTS
** 1973–1975 Lancia Stratos

==V8==
===2.9===

The Dino V8, now bored to , replaced the V6 in the next line of street Dinos to be produced by Ferrari, the 1973 GT4 and 1975 GTB &quot;308&quot; cars. Although the model name suggests 3.0 L, the V8 displaced only which rounds down to 2.9 L and was another DOHC 2-valve design.

Applications:
* 1973–1976 308 GT4 (branded &quot;Dino&quot;) &quot;F106AL&quot;
* 1976–1980 308 GT4 (branded &quot;Ferrari&quot;) &quot;F106AL&quot;
* 1975–1980 308 GTB &quot;F106AB&quot;
* 1977–1980 308 GTS &quot;F106AB&quot;

====Fuel injection====

The 1980 &quot;i&quot; models added fuel injection to the existing engine.

Applications:
* 1980–1982 Mondial 8 &quot;F106B&quot;
* 1980–1982 308 GTBi &amp; GTSi &quot;F106BB&quot;

====Quattrovalvole====

4 valves per cylinder were added for the 1982 308 and Mondial &quot;Quattrovalvole&quot; (or QV), bringing power back up to the pre-FI high of .

A very unusual Dino Quattrovalvole was used in the Lancia Thema 8·32. It was based on the 308 QV&#x27;s engine, but used a cross-plane crankshaft rather than the Ferrari-type flat-plane. The engine was constructed by Ducati rather than Ferrari, and was produced from 1986 through 1991.

The Quattrovalvole was also used by Lancia for their attempt at the World Sportscar Championship with the LC2. The engine was twin-turbocharged and destroked to 2.65 litres, but produced in qualifying trim. The engine was later increased to 3.0 litres and increased power output to .

Applications:
* 1982–1985 308 GTB QV &amp; GTS QV &quot;F105AB&quot;
* 1982–1985 Mondial QV &quot;F105A&quot;
* 1986–1991 Lancia Thema 8·32 &quot;F105L&quot;
* 1983–1991 Lancia LC2

===2.0===
These small V8 variants were chiefly intended for the domestic market, where cars with engines larger than two-litre incurred in an almost doubled 38% value added tax.

In 1975 the company introduced the Dino 208 GT4. The bore was reduced from but the stroke remained at . Output was reduced as well, from .
Applications:
* 1975–1976 208 GT4 (branded &quot;Dino&quot;) &quot;F106C&quot;
* 1976–1980 208 GT4 (branded &quot;Ferrari&quot;) &quot;F106C&quot;
* 1980–1982 208 GTB &quot;F106CB&quot;
* 1980–1982 208 GTS &quot;F106CB&quot;

====Turbocharged====
1982 saw the introduction of the 208 Turbo. The 208 Turbo featured , more than the fuel injected 308 from the previous year. Except for the non-intercooled 208 Turbo engine, all the forced induction F1 and road engines from 1980 to 1989 were designed and developed by Nicola Materazzi due to his experience in fuels, engines, combustion, turbo and Comprex that had accumulated in his career (Mobil, Lancia, Osella).

Applications:
* 1982–1985 208 GTB Turbo &quot;F106D&quot;
* 1982–1985 208 GTS Turbo &quot;F106D&quot;
* 1986–1989 GTB Turbo &quot;F106N&quot;
* 1986–1989 GTS Turbo &quot;F106N&quot;
===288 GTO===

The turbo also served as a development platform for the forthcoming 1984 288 GTO sports car. That famous Ferrari was meant for Group B racing, with a version of the 308&#x27;s engine (bore was down by to meet the regulations of the class). With IHI twin-turbochargers, a Behr intercooler, and Weber-Marelli fuel injection, the GTO boasted from Dino&#x27;s engine.

Applications:
* 1984–1985 Ferrari 288 GTO (Designer: Nicola Materazzi)

===3.2===

The 1985 328 and 3.2 Mondial used a bored and stroked 3.0 &quot;QV&quot; V8 to version called the &quot;Tipo F105CB&quot;. That naturally aspirated engine boasted .

Applications:
* 1985–1989 328 GTB &amp; GTS
* 1985–1989 3.2 Mondial

===F117===
Two prototype Ferrari 408 4RMs from 1987 and 1988 used a 90° rear and longitudinally mounted 4.0 litre (3,999.7 cc) V8 that produces at 6,250 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm. The engine has a compression ratio of 9.8: 1 and a bore and stroke of 93 mm and 73.6 mm respectively, bringing total displacement to 3 999.66 cm³ (4.0 L). The engine also features double overhead camshafts with four valves per cylinder, as well as Weber-Marelli fuel injection and dry sump lubrication.

A transverse mounted transaxle version of the engine called the F117A was built and tested by Ferrari as a possible option for the upcoming 348 but was decided against due to Ferrari&#x27;s preference for smaller displacement high revving engines. A twin turbocharged version was also reportedly tested, producing at 6800 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm.

===F120A===

In 1987, the F40 sports car debuted with the &quot;Tipo F120A&quot; engine. The Dino-based engine now had a bore x stroke of and of turbo boost for at 7000 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm while the US designated engines, code named the &quot;Tipo F120 D&quot; were rated at .

Applications:
* 1987–1992 F40 (Designer: Nicola Materazzi)

===F120B===
The &quot;Tipo F120 B&quot;, used in the Ferrari F40 LM, retained the same displacement as the F120A, but the output of the IHI turbochargers was upped to and the compression ratio was increased to 8.0:1 for at 7500 rpm.

Applications:
*1989-1996 Ferrari F40 LM (Designer: Nicola Materazzi)

===3.4===

The 1989 introduction of the 348 and Mondial t saw the Dino V8 pushed to with a bore x stroke of . Power was up to in the Tipo F129D/G, and revised as the Tipo F119H with in later Ferrari 348s.

Applications:
* Tipo F129D &amp; Tipo F119G
** 1989–1993 348 tb &amp; ts
** 1989–1993 Mondial t

* Tipo F119H
** 1994 348 GTC

===3.5===

The 1994 F355 included their first production 5-valve engine, and sported a longer stroke for and . This &quot;Tipo F129B&quot; was used from 1994 through 1998. It was revised as the &quot;Tipo F129C&quot;, debuting in 1998 and used through 1999.

Applications:
* Tipo F129B
** 1994–1998 F355 GTB &amp; GTS

** 1998–1999 355 F1 GTB, GTS &amp; Spider
===3.6===

The 1999 360 Modena retained the bore of the F355 engine and the 5-valve per cylinder layout, but increased the stroke to , to raise the displacement again to and . Modifications to the intake/exhaust and an increased 11.2:1 compression ratio produced for the 360 Challenge Stradale. This &quot;Tipo F131&quot; was produced from 1999 through 2004.

Applications:
* 1999–2004 360 Modena
* 2000–2005 360 Spider
* 2003 Challenge Stradale

The Dino V8 was retired in 2004 with the introduction of the new Ferrari-Maserati F136 engine used in the Ferrari F430.

==V12==
A new V12 engine family debuted in the 1992 456 as the &quot;Tipo F116&quot;. It featured the Dino 65° V angle with an 88 mm bore and the same 75 mm stroke as the Dino V8 found in the 348, that was produced at the time of introduction.

It was then revised again as the &quot;Tipo F133&quot; and used in the front engined 550 (5.5 litre) and later in 575M Maranello and 612 Scaglietti (5.75 litre).

<doc id="1188429" wikidata="Q2345229" url="?curid=1188429" title="Obsidian (character)">
<text>Obsidian (Todd James Rice) is a superhero published by DC Comics. He first appeared in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #25 (September 1983), and was created by Roy Thomas and Jerry Ordway. He is the son of Alan Scott and Rose Canton and the twin brother of Jade. According to an &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; letter page, Obsidian was named &quot;Todd&quot; after a friend of Thomas.

Obsidian made his first live-action appearance on the second season of the DC show &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, with a younger version of the character portrayed by Dan Payne, with no speaking lines, and an older version portrayed by Lance Henriksen. Rice also appears in the third season of &quot;Stargirl&quot; on the CW network played by Tim Gabriel.

==Creation==
Thomas spoke on the character&#x27;s creation, stating &quot;To make up for Nuklon&#x27;s and Northwind&#x27;s non-blood-relative status, Dann and I decided that Alan Scott, a.k.a. Green Lantern, would have two kids in the new group—twins, no less... Obsidian became the dark side of the ring&#x27;s magic, but that concept seems to have taken a bit more time to come together.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
Todd Rice is the son of Alan Scott and Rose Canton, respectively the Golden Age superhero Green Lantern and villain Thorn. Todd was raised in an abusive adoptive home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a teenager, he discovers that he has a twin sister, Jennie-Lynn Hayden / Jade. After reuniting, the two follow in their father&#x27;s footsteps and become superheroes and founding members of Infinity, Inc.

===Post-Crisis===
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Obsidian becomes a member of the Justice League. At one point, he was corrupted by Ian Karkull and attempted to cover the world in darkness before being defeated and cured of his mental instability.

Afterwards, Obsidan retired, came to terms with his self-identity as a gay man, and began dating Damon Matthews, an assistant district attorney and ally of Kate Spencer / Manhunter.

After being attacked by Karkull, Obsidian is transformed into a dark egg before it eventually hatches and resurrects him.

====Brightest Day====
During the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; storyline, Obsidian and the JSA battle Alan Scott, who has been possessed by the Starheart, the cosmic force that empowers him and his children. During this time, he and Jade are fused into a singular entity controlled by the Starheart before eventually being separated.

===Convergence===
In the 2015 comics event &quot;Convergence&quot;, a two-part miniseries titled &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; featured the return of the pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; version of the Infinity Inc. team, including Todd as Obsidian. Todd and Infinity Inc. were brought to Telos in the series. This Obsidian was based on his pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version but had elements of the modern day version of the character as well. His counterparts made veiled references to Todd&#x27;s sexuality and appeared accepting of him being in a relationship with a man.

===DC Rebirth===
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Obsidian is among the Justice Society members who were erased from history when Doctor Manhattan altered history to prevent Alan Scott from becoming a Green Lantern. However, he and the Society are eventually restored when Superman convinces Manhattan to return history to normal. Obsidian then reunites with his father, who comes out as gay to him.

==Powers and abilities==
Obsidian is able to harness the energy of the Shadowlands to manipulate shadows, the result of his father being exposed to shadow energy during a battle with Ian Karkull. This enables him to become intangible, fly, and grow to an enormous size.

==Other versions==

* An alternate universe variant of Obsidian who resembles the Shadow appears in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; as a member of Batman&#x27;s Outsiders.
* Two characters based on Obsidian appear in the Tangent Comics universe. The first is Todd Rice, an operative of Nightwing also known as Dark Star, while the second is an unnamed female operative of Nightwing&#x27;s Russian counterpart Meridian who can transform into stone.
* Two alternate universe variants of Todd Rice appears in &quot;The New 52&quot;.
* An alternate version of Obsidian appears in the Amalgam Comics universe fused with Gambit of the X-Men, going under the name of Wraith.

==Sexual orientation==
He has a short-lived, troubled relationship with Marcie Cooper, the third Harlequin, shortly before the disbanding of Infinity, Inc. Later, sexual confusion was shown during his tenure in the Justice League, when he told his friend Nuklon that the only two people he could ever love in the world were his sister and him. When Nuklon asked if he was gay, Obsidian did not fully answer, instead asking &quot;Why must there be labels?&quot; After Obsidian&#x27;s redemption, &quot;JSA&quot; penciller Steven Sadowski stated that Todd&#x27;s sexuality would be dealt with whenever he returned to that title.
Todd appeared in &quot;Manhunter&quot; (vol. 3) #18 where he shares a kiss with Damon Matthews, a recurring gay character, and spoke in the fashion of a lover, confirming his sexuality. Marc Andreyko, the writer of &quot;Manhunter&quot;, goes into detail about selecting Obsidian as Damon&#x27;s lover:

I didn&#x27;t want to make a character gay unless it felt organic. So, the list was pretty short. Then I remembered when Obsidian was in the JLA years ago and Gerard Jones, the writer, danced around the issue. I went back and read all my Infinity, Inc.&#x27;s and although Todd dated women, it was always a mess.

Andreyko said that DC was supportive, wanting a &quot;visible gay character&quot; and that it was &quot;a general void in the DCU that needed exploration&quot;. Geoff Johns, longtime writer of &quot;JSA&quot;, also stated his support for the idea.

When writer Bill Willingham took over the &quot;JSA&quot; title, there was a great amount of concern among fans about how this would affect Todd (as Willingham is a Republican). Some fans even feared that Willingham would &quot;cure&quot; Todd&#x27;s sexuality. In &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) #40, Willingham attempted to address this concern in a humorous way by having the newly restored Obsidian announce that his homosexuality has been cured, only for him to quickly renounce this claim, telling the readers, while breaking the fourth wall for a brief moment, that he was only joking and that he was still gay.

As of &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) #43 (October 2010), Todd is still dating Damon, confirming this in conversation with his father.

During the crossover &quot;Convergence Infinity Inc.&quot;, Obsidian&#x27;s sexuality is referenced. His teammates are okay if he is gay, but he denies it even though he brought a close male friend to his sister&#x27;s theatre performance.

==Rogues gallery==
The following are enemies of Obsidian:

* Ian Karkull: A former foe of the All-Star Squadron and the Justice Society of America. Having been believed to be dead for decades, Ian manipulated Obsidian to gain access to, and subsequently rule, the Shadowlands. Karkull had apparently been corrupting Obsidian for months in an effort to get revenge on his enemies in the Justice Society.
* Chroma: A cosmic entity that Obsidian faced during his time with Infinity, Inc. Chroma interrupted a televised concert with a song about apocalyptic events. The song, though talking about death, somehow proved so engaging that many people desired to hear it again and again. Todd, having just come off a bad date, found himself uninvolved with the song (thus making him immune to its effects).
* Kid Karnevil: While posing as a new JSA recruit, All-American Kid, Jeremy Karne attacked Obsidian with an illumination device. The attack left Todd in a severely degenerated state. Karne later stole the black egg that Obsidian had degenerated into and handed it over to his allies in the Fourth Reich.
* Harlequin: A former girlfriend of Todd&#x27;s. She attempted to recruit him to the Manhunters, but he refused. Marcie was later responsible for the murder of Todd&#x27;s leader and friend, Sylvester Pemberton.

==In other media==

* Obsidian makes non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; as a member of the Justice League.
* Obsidian appears in the second season of &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, portrayed by Dan Payne as a young man and by Lance Henriksen as an older man.

* Todd Rice appears in the third season of &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Tim Gabriel. This version was separated from his sister Jennie-Lynn Hayden and taken in by the Helix Institute for Youth Rehabilitation while looking for her. Additionally, their powers became connected to each other after her ring, which she inherited from their father Alan Scott, is infected by dark matter residue left over from her fight with Eclipso in the second season. Jennie and Todd eventually reunite and she helps him gain control of his powers while Shade agrees to help him further.

<doc id="1188434" wikidata="Q1265281" url="?curid=1188434" title="Year of the Elephant">
<text>The ʿām al-fīl (, Year of the Elephant) is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 570–571 CE. According to Islamic resources, it was in this year that prophet Mohammad was born. The name is derived from an event said to have occurred at Mecca: Abraha, the Abyssinian, Christian king of Himyarite marched upon the Ka‘bah in Mecca with a large army, which included war elephants, intending to demolish it. However, the lead elephant, known as &#x27;Mahmud&#x27; (), is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca, and refused to enter. It has been mentioned in the Quran that the army was destroyed by small birds, sent by God, that carried pebbles that destroyed the entire army and Abraha perished. Surah Fil in the Quran contains an account of the event. The year came to be known as the Year of the Elephant, beginning a trend for reckoning the years in the Arabian Peninsula. This reckoning was used until it was replaced with the Islamic calendar during the times of ‘Omar.

Archaeological discoveries in Southern Arabia suggest that Year of the Elephant may have been 569 or 568, as the Sasanian Empire overthrew the Aksumite-affiliated rulers in Yemen around 570.

The year is also recorded as that of the birth of ‘Ammar ibn Yasir.

== Events ==
According to early Islamic historians such as Ibn Ishaq, in honor of his ally, Abraha built a great church at Sana&#x27;a known as &quot;al-Qullays&quot;, a loanword borrowed from &quot;church&quot;.

Al-Qullays gained widespread fame, even gaining the notice of the Byzantine Empire. Other Arab people of the time had their own center of religious worship and pilgrimage in Mecca, the Kaaba. Abraha attempted to divert their pilgrimage to al-Qullays and appointed a man named Muhammad ibn Khuza&#x27;i to Mecca and Tihamah as a king with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols.

Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s Prophetic biography states:

Abraha, incensed, launched an expedition of sixty thousand men against the Ka‘bah at Mecca, led by a white elephant named &quot;Mahmud&quot; (and possibly with other elephants - some accounts state there were several elephants, or even as many as eight) in order to destroy the Ka‘bah. Several Arab tribes attempted to fight him on the way, but were defeated.

When news of the advance of Abraha&#x27;s army came, the Arab tribes of the Quraysh, Banu Kinanah, Banu Khuza&#x27;a and Banu Hudhayl united in defense of the Ka‘bah. However, this coalition was plagued by infighting and rival interests, with many other various tribes instead choosing to ally and submit with the intent of undermining their competitors. A man from the Himyarite Kingdom was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. ‘Abdul Muttalib, the grandfather of Muhammad, told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he with some leading members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Ka‘bah. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying, &quot;The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.&quot;

The reference to the story in Qur’an is rather short. According to Surah al-Fil, the next day [as Abraha prepared to enter the city], a dark cloud of small birds named &#x27;Ababil&#x27; () appeared. The birds carried small rocks in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them like &quot;eaten straw&quot;. However according to Muhammad Asad this surah does not describe birds literally carrying small rocks, he instead, referencing Al-Zamakhshari and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi translates the above mentioned verses as:

According to Mohammad Asad, the words used in this verse, namely the &quot;stones of sijjil&quot;, denote &quot;a writing and, tropically, something that has been decreed [by God]&quot;. He further explains that this decree by God was a very sudden epidemic outbreak, which, according to Ibn Ishaq, caused fever (in arabic hasbah) and smallpox (arab. judari). This, as Asad concludes, points to the fact that the &quot;stone hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained&quot; were a very sudden virulent epidemic due to the fact that the word for fever &quot;hasbah&quot; primarily means &quot;pelting [or smiting] with stones&quot; in the famous arabic dictionary &quot;al-Qamous&quot; (القاموس) by Fairuzabadi. The word ta&#x27;ir can denote any &quot;flying creature, whether bird or insect (Taj al-&#x27;Arus)&quot;. However, some scholars like Neal Robinson disagree with Asad method of translation and interpretation.

==Shia==
According to Hadith, in al-Kafi Volume one, Imam Ali was born in the 20th year of the Elephant and died in AH 40.

== Other sources ==
This event is referred to in the Qur’an, in Surah 105, &quot;Al-Fil&quot; (, &quot;The Elephant&quot;), and is discussed in its related tafsir.

Some scholars have placed the Year of the Elephant one or two decades earlier than 570 CE, with a tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the works of ‘Abd al-Razzaq al-San‘ani placing it before the birth of Muhammad&#x27;s father.

<text>Royce Herbert Frith, (November 12, 1923 – March 17, 2005) was a Canadian diplomat, public servant, lawyer, broadcaster, and politician.

==Education ==
He received a BA from the University of Toronto, an LL.B from Osgoode Hall Law School and a Dipl. d’études supérieures (droit) from the University of Ottawa. He was admitted to the Ontario Bar in 1949 and would become a partner in the Toronto firm of Magwood, Frith &amp; Casey, specializing in litigation, municipal and broadcast and entertainment industry law.

==Broadcasting==
An amateur actor and performer, Frith found time to act in plays, perform on the radio, and sing and play several instruments, while concurrently building his legal career. In 1949, he hosted western music show &quot;Home on the Range&quot; on radio station CFRB in Toronto. He also sang in a choir as a youth that appeared regularly on CBC Radio and continued to appear on CBC singing in radio operas, acting in dramas such on the anthology series &quot;Wednesday Night&quot; and &quot;Stage&quot; and as a panelist on &quot;The Superior Sex&quot; and &quot;Live A Borrowed Life&quot; on CBC Television in the 1950s. In the 1960s he presented the public affairs show &quot;Telepoll&quot; on the CTV Television Network for several seasons.

Frith successfully applied to the Board of Broadcast Governors in 1963 for a license to operate a new radio station in Windsor, Ontario. Frith was awarded a license to operate CKWW-AM but sold the station to Geoff Stirling before it went on the air.

==Early political career==
A resident of the Toronto suburb of Leaside, Ontario, Frith was elected to Leaside town council in the 1950s first as councillor and later as Deputy Reeve before he and his law firm were appointed the town&#x27;s solicitors.

Active in Liberal Party politics, Frith was president of the Ontario Liberal Party from 1960 to 1961.

==Federal government and Senate==
Frith first came to prominence as a member of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in the 1960s. He served as a legal advisor to the Commissioner of Official Languages from 1971 until 1977 when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Pierre Trudeau. He sat in the Upper House as a Liberal and served in various positions including Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate and led the Liberals&#x27; filibuster against the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax forcing Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to use an obscure section of the Constitution to appoint extra Senators and ensure passage of the measure.

==High Commissioner==
Frith left the Upper House in 1994 to become Canada&#x27;s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Frith had a very high profile and used his flair for public performance to his advantage, particularly during Canada&#x27;s Turbot War with Spain in which he played a crucial role in rallying British public opinion behind Canada. Frith also ensured the retention of Canada House in Trafalgar Square as the site of the Canadian high commission when the government had considered abandoning the location in order to save money. Frith returned to Canada in 1996 and resumed his law practice.

==Later life==
In his last years, Firth was a lawyer with the firm Ladner Downs in Vancouver and went into the office daily until just a few weeks prior to his death. He served on various boards including the Board of Trustees of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. Frith has also served on the governing bodies of the Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific and the Vancouver Symphony. In 2000 he was appointed a member of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="1188453" wikidata="Q1350935" url="?curid=1188453" title="Fate (role-playing game system)">
<text>Fate is a generic role-playing game system based on the &quot;Fudge&quot; gaming system. It has no fixed setting, traits, or genre and is customizable. It is designed to offer minimal obstruction to role-playing by assuming players want to make fewer dice rolls.

==Description==

Fate is derived from the &quot;Fudge&quot; system, primarily that earlier design&#x27;s verbal scale and Fudge dice, but most versions of Fate eschew the use of mandatory traits such as Strength and Intelligence. Instead, it uses a long list of skills and assumes that every character is &quot;mediocre&quot; in all skills except those that the character is explicitly defined as being good at. Skills may perform one or more of the four actions: attacking, defending, overcoming obstacles (a catch-all for solving problems) or creating an advantage (see below). Exceptional abilities are defined through the use of &quot;Stunts&quot; and &quot;Aspects&quot;.

An aspect is a free form descriptor of something notable about either the character or the scene. A relevant aspect can be invoked to grant a bonus to a die roll (either adding +2, or allowed a re-roll of the dice); this usually costs the player or GM a fate point. Aspects may also be compelled to influence the setting by offering the person with the aspect a fate point (which they can refuse by spending one of their own) to put them at a disadvantage relevant to the aspect. An example given in the rule book refers to the GM invoking a player character&#x27;s &quot;Rivals in the Collegia Arcana&quot; aspect to have said rivals attack them in the bath so they don&#x27;t have access to their equipment. Situational aspects describe the scene, and may be created and used by the GM, or by players using the create advantage action with a relevant skill.

Stunts are exceptional abilities that grant the character a specific mechanical benefit; these may be drawn from a pre-defined list of stunts included in the rules, or created following guidelines provided by the authors. Aspects, on the other hand, are always defined by the player. For example, a player may choose to give their character an aspect of &quot;Brawny&quot; (or &quot;Muscle Man&quot; or &quot;Wiry Strength&quot;); during play, the player may invoke those aspects to gain a temporary bonus in a relevant situation. Aspects may also relate to a character&#x27;s possessions, e.g., the character Indiana Jones for example, might have the Aspect &quot;Whip and Fedora&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;Fate&quot; was written by Fred Hicks and Rob Donoghue and was originally released through a dedicated Yahoo! group in early 2003. A much more polished edition was published by Evil Hat Productions in the summer of 2003.

===3rd Edition ===
A 3rd edition of &quot;Fate&quot; is used as the rules system for the RPG &quot;Spirit of the Century&quot;, which is set in the pulp magazine genre. It was nominated in 2007 for an ENnie award for &quot;Best Rules&quot;. 

The 3rd edition rules also are used for the RPG &quot;Dresden Files&quot;. Several other role-playing games are built on the game mechanics of &quot;Fate 3.0&quot;.

===&quot;Fate Core&quot; (4th edition) and &quot;Fate Accelerated Edition&quot; (FAE)===
A 4th edition called &quot;Fate Core&quot; (again a generic version) was published in 2013, funded by a successful crowdfunding campaign, and released under two free content licenses: CC BY 3.0 and the Open gaming license. To release the new version of Fate, Evil Hat Productions ran a Kickstarter campaign that initially asked for $3,000. At the end of the campaign they raised $433,365 and expanded the product line significantly, adding two world books and a system toolkit.

As a result of another crowd funding effort, Evil Hat released &quot;Fate Accelerated&quot;, a streamlined version of the rules based on the same core mechanic intended to get players into the game faster. One notable difference is that skills are replaced with six &quot;approaches&quot; to solving problems - Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, and Sneaky. The approaches can each use all four skill actions. Evil Hat also released Fate Condensed, a condensed version of Fate Core with minor rule changes.

==Reception==
In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted compared &quot;Fate&quot; to &quot;GURPS&quot;, published twenty years earlier, saying, &quot;&quot;Fate&quot; stands at a similar intersection, drawing from and synthesizing an array of contemporary design ideas, a kind of amalgamated avatar of the RPG industry, circa 2003, 2006, and 2013 — and growing still.&quot;

==Awards==
In the 2003 Indie RPG Awards, &quot;Fate&quot; won a number of awards:

* First Place - &quot;Best Free Game of the Year&quot;
* First Place - &quot;Best Support&quot;
* Third Place - &quot;Indie RPG of the Year&quot;

When the system was originally published FATE was considered an acronym for &quot;Fudge Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment&quot;, then for 2nd edition, &quot;Fantastic Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment&quot;. Most recently &quot;FATE&quot; has been simplified to just be &quot;Fate&quot; and is no longer an acronym.

<doc id="1188456" wikidata="Q4744575" url="?curid=1188456" title="American Negro Labor Congress">
<text>The American Negro Labor Congress was established in 1925 by the Communist Party as a vehicle for advancing the rights of African Americans, propagandizing for communism within the black community and recruiting African American members for the party.

The organization attacked the segregationist practices of many of the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor; it also campaigned against lynching, the disfranchisement of black Americans, and Jim Crow laws. The group was renamed the League of Struggle for Negro Rights in 1930.

==Organizational history==
===Background===

The first mass organization of the American Communist Party dedicated to advancing issues of importance to American blacks and building a party presence within the black community was the African Blood Brotherhood (ABB). The ABB was established independently of the nascent Communist movement but had been formally brought under party auspices as a byproduct of its need for funding. In 1923 the tiny New York City-based organization was formally integrated into the structure of the Workers Party of America, as the party was then known. The group&#x27;s handful of activists had proven insufficient to maintain critical mass, however, and by 1924 the ABB had been virtually dissolved.

American Communists had been ineffectual in its efforts to build a significant mass organization among American blacks during the first half decade of the movement&#x27;s existence and the Communist International prodded the Workers Party to begin a new initiative to establish a group able to mobilize black workers. The result of this push was the establishment of a new organization called the American Negro Labor Congress.

According to historian Maria Gertrudis van Enckevort, archival evidence indicates that the idea for the new mass organization directed to American blacks came from Lovett Fort-Whiteman, a national organizer for the ABB who had been sent to Moscow by the summer of 1924 for ideological and technical training. Fort-Whiteman complained in an October 1924 letter to head of the Comintern Gregory Zinoviev about the lack of work being conducted by the American Communist and repeated a call to act on a plan he had submitted to the Far Eastern Section of the Comintern seeking convocation of an &quot;American Negro Labor Congress.&quot;

This idea found support among Comintern decision-makers and in December 1924 a communication was passed on to the Workers Party of America, current name of the Communist Party, stating &quot;it has been proposed to call an American Negro Labour Congress at Chicago, to be held sometime during the summer&quot; and seeking the American party&#x27;s advice.

===Convention call===
The call for the American Negro Labor Congress was issued late in the spring of 1925 with the proposal emanating from the Workers (Communist) Party. Although the convention call vaguely established &quot;some time in the summer&quot; for the time of the gathering, in actuality the founding convention did not take place in Chicago until October 25, 1925. There were 17 signatories of the convention call, of whom six were members of the Workers Party.

The communists sought to use front tactics by downplaying their own presence and casting the ANLC as a multi-tendency organization, thereby reducing the chance of the group&#x27;s ability to challenge the NAACP and the Marcus Garvey&#x27;s UNIA as the paramount voice of the black working class. The convention call indicated that delegates must represent black or interracial trade unions, farm workers, or unorganized factory workers — although provision was made for participation by &quot;individual advocates&quot; engaged in promoting &quot;the cause of the working class.&quot;

The man most directly responsible for the idea of the new group, Lovett Fort-Whiteman was named its national organizer. Fort-Whiteman had been a delegate to the 5th World Congress of the Comintern in 1924 and the recipient of a crash course in party organization at the International Lenin School in Moscow and was regarded as one of the party&#x27;s leading black cadres.

American-born and educated at the Tuskegee Institute, the veteran former member of the Socialist Party of America Fort-Whiteman had been selected to lead the new group over other top black Communists, including Cyril Briggs, Richard B. Moore, and Otto Huiswoud.

Fort-Whiteman, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym &quot;James Jackson,&quot; was the advocate of the idea of convening an &quot;American-Negro Labor Congress&quot; at Chicago to bring together black workers from around the country and had written to Moscow in an attempt to win support for the idea from the Far-Eastern Section of the Comintern. Fort-Whiteman sought &quot;to approach the negro on his own mental grounds&quot; by concentrating activity on fighting racism in American society, the prevalence of which Fort-Whiteman believed dulled black Americans&#x27; sense of class consciousness and immunized them to calls for class struggle.

The call for the founding convention consequently touched upon not only matters of importance to labor in general but also spoke to specifically racial interests such as the &quot;abolition of Jim Crowism,&quot; an end to electoral restrictions disfranchising blacks, enforcement of &quot;the right of the Negro to equal accommodations with whites in all theaters, restaurants, hotels, etc.,&quot; an end to discrimination in education, and Congressional action to make lynching a federal crime.

===Establishment===
The founding convention of the American Negro Labor Congress opened on the evening of Sunday, October 25, 1925, with a mass meeting which heard the reports of national organizer Fort-Whitman and national secretary H.V. Williams. Fort-Whitman&#x27;s keynote speech declared that the new organization was established &quot;to gather, to mobilize, and to coordinate into a fighting machine the most enlightened and militant and class-conscious workers of the race&quot; in support of concrete objectives.

Approximately 40 delegates attended the founding congress of the ANLC, which was organized around the slogan &quot;Organization is the first step to freedom.&quot; Delegate Otto Huiswood, a prominent black Communist party activist from New York, emphasized the need to bring black workers into the trade unions of the American Federation of Labor, declaring that if the established unions could not be racially integrated, it would fall to black workers to establish parallel unions of their own.

The October 1925 founding convention passed resolutions demanding &quot;the full equality of the Negro people in the social system of the United States, and everywhere.&quot; An end to Jim Crow laws, segregation, electoral discrimination, and discrimination in public education was demanded and discrimination in housing and public accommodation duly noted as part of a demand for &quot;full social equality for the Negro people. The Ku Klux Klan was condemned and the exclusion of black jurors from the juries picked for the trials of black defendants was sharply criticized, as was continued segregation in the United States military.

At the founding convention was announced that 10 American blacks were already in Moscow enrolled at the University of the Toilers of the East, where they were ostensibly being trained for work in the Soviet &quot;diplomatic service.&quot; The delegates also heard an enthusiastic speech delivered by &quot;Bad Bishop&quot; William Montgomery Brown, who hammered the capitalist class and declared that &quot;the Christian church was started by workers and you workers must take it back.&quot;

Behind the scenes the governing National Executive Committee of the ANLC was instructed by the Comintern to convene a &quot;World Race Conference,&quot; in an effort to internationalize the black liberation movement — a repetition of an unsuccessful effort by the Comintern to hold an international race conference made in 1922. Such a congress was to be held with a view to establishing a world organization of black workers and farmers which would unite exploited colonial populations to overthrow imperialism, the Comintern indicated.

The Comintern also participated in the ANLC financially, budgeting $2,500 for organizers&#x27; salaries, travel expenses, and the production of pamphlets and leaflets. This was no great change in previous practice, as from the perspective of the Comintern and the American Communist Party the ANLC merely replaced the moribund African Blood Brotherhood, an entity which was a previous recipient of financial support.

===Reaction of white labor movement===

The officialdom of the American Federation of Labor was hostile to the new ANLC, with AFL President William Green cautioning black unionists that they were &quot;being led into a trap.&quot; Green charged that the Communists were attempting to foster &quot;race hatred into the lives&quot; of African Americans and to trick blacks into believing that the revolutionary overthrow of the American government and its replacement with a Soviet republic was the sole solution to their social ills.

Green&#x27;s attitude drew return fire from the ANLC, which called the AFL chief&#x27;s position &quot;clearly erroneous, harmful, and prejudicial to the best interests of the American labor movement.&quot;

Despite such protestations, the mainstream press of America echoed Green&#x27;s hostile sentiments, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; accusing the Communists of attempting to &quot;stir up race hatred and disorder&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Record&quot; rejecting the entire idea that American blacks could be &quot;bolshevized&quot; as &quot;ridiculously childish.&quot;

===Discord within ANLC===

In addition to external hostility, a spirit of factionalism and personal strife existed within the ranks of the ANLC. The selection of Fort-Whiteman as leader by the Comintern had proven controversial, as he seemed to leapfrog long-time party activists with impeccable bona fides, including Moore, Huiswoud, and Briggs. This situation was exacerbated by Fort-Whiteman&#x27;s own growing sense of self-importance, his tendency to make decisions by fiat, and his propensity to wear grandiose Russian garb. A steady stream of complaints about Fort-Whiteman to the Negro Commission of the Workers (Communist) Party followed, sidetracking the organization&#x27;s work.

The Workers (Communist) Party also mishandled the ANLC&#x27;s operations, moving the group&#x27;s headquarters from the black Chicago South Side to an all-white neighborhood, failing to issue the group&#x27;s newspaper in a timely manner, and making overly clear in the group&#x27;s literature its connection to the widely distrusted national communist organization. The result was a very nearly stillborn ANLC, with only seven functioning branches by the summer of 1926.

===Activities===

The official organ of the American Negro Labor Congress was a newspaper called &quot;The Negro Champion,&quot; published in New York. In 1929 this was succeeded by a new publication, a magazine called &quot;The Liberator.&quot;

===Dissolution===

In 1930 the American Negro Labor Congress was terminated through the initiative of the Communist Party and replaced by a new organization called the League of Struggle for Negro Rights.

<doc id="1188460" wikidata="Q7335725" url="?curid=1188460" title="Ripple effect">
<text>A ripple effect occurs when an initial disturbance to a system propagates outward to disturb an increasingly larger portion of the system, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it.

The ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier in macroeconomics. For example, an individual&#x27;s reduction in spending reduces the incomes of others and their ability to spend. In a broader global context, research has shown how monetary policy decisions, especially by major economies like the US, can create ripple effects impacting economies worldwide, emphasizing the interconnectedness of today&#x27;s global economy. 

In sociology, the ripple effect can be observed in how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction, and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from the community to broaden its impact.

The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.

== Examples ==
=== The Weinstein effect and the rise of the Me Too movement ===
In October 2017, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, dozens of women have accused American film producer Harvey Weinstein, former founder of Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company, of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse for over a period of three decades. Shortly after over eighty accusations, Harvey was dismissed from his own company, expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other professional associations, and even retired from public view. The allegations against him resulted in a special case of ripple effect, now called the Weinstein effect. This means a global trend involving a serial number of sexual misconduct allegations towards other famous men in Hollywood, such as Louis CK and Kevin Spacey. The effect led to the formation of the controversial Me Too movement, where people share their experiences of sexual harassment/assault.

===Corporate social responsibility===
The effects of one company&#x27;s decision to adopt a corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme on the attitudes and behaviours of rival companies has been likened to a ripple effect. Research by an international team in 2018 found that in many cases, one company&#x27;s CSR initiative was seen as a competitive threat to other businesses in the same market, resulting in the adoption of further CSR initiatives.

==See also==
*Butterfly effect⁣ — an effect where a minimal change in one state of a system results in large differences in its later state.
*Clapotis — a non-breaking standing wave with higher amplitude than the waves it&#x27;s composed of.
*Domino effect — an effect where one event sets off a chain of non-incremental other events.
*Snowball effect — an effect where a process starting from an initial state of small significance builds upon itself in time.

<doc id="1188463" wikidata="Q6193620" url="?curid=1188463" title="Jim Bellows">
<text>James Gilbert Bellows (November 12, 1922 – March 6, 2009) was an American journalist of the 20th century. Bellows has been credited with the inspiration and nurture of many leading writers of the New Journalism during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life==
Bellows was born to a successful Detroit salesman and his family in 1922. While he was a child, his parents moved to the Cleveland, Ohio, area. Following a common practice of families with &quot;aspirations&quot;, and with financial assistance from an aunt, he was sent at 13 years of age to attend South Kent School — a private college-preparatory boarding school for boys in South Kent, Connecticut, graduating in 1940. &quot;We were not cradled through those years, and it (South Kent) was a wonderful place to build character.&quot; The 1940 yearbook shows his nickname as &quot;Maggot&quot;, a fond reference to his 5&#x27;0&quot; stature, to which he owed his success as coxwain for the SKS crew.&quot;

Bellows went on to attend Kenyon College, before serving as a Navy aviator, training to fly the F6F &quot;Hellcat&quot; in World War II. Although he tried to accelerate his training, he didn&#x27;t ship out until after the war, when he flew from a carrier based near Guam and Saipan. He returned to Kenyon after his service, and graduated in 1947 with a B.A. in philosophy.

==Editorships==
Among the organizations Bellows served, Bellows had editorial positions at:
* city editor of the &quot;Columbus Ledger&quot; (1947–1950)
** started as a cub (rookie) reporter, received national attentionand a promotion to city editorafter reporting on his being assaulted by local (Georgia) members of the Ku Klux Klan;
* &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; (1950–1957)
* &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; (1957–1959)
** his hometown paper
* &quot;The Miami News&quot; (1959–1960)
* editor of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; (1961–1966)
** &quot;We couldn&#x27;t compete with the resources of the Times; we had to establish a niche for ourselves. The answer was to rediscover New York.&quot;;
* associate editor of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (1967–1974)
** he described the &quot;Times&quot; as &quot;the velvet coffin&quot;
* editor of &quot;The Washington Star&quot; (1975–1978)
* editor of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; (1978–1981)
* managing editor of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; (1981–1983)
* executive editor of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; (1983–1986)

Time and again, Bellows served as editor of underdog, &quot;second&quot; newspapers in large cities. He established a reputation as an innovator whose style of refined sensationalism challenged the leading rival newspapers—namely, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His eloquent, often humorous, and self-effacing style attracted, nurtured, and often inspired a new generation of young writers including Judith Crist, Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Denis Hamill, Gail Sheehy, Maureen Dowd and Tony Castro. At the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, it was Bellows&#x27; initiative to hire &quot;Esquire&quot; editor Clay Felker and create a new Sunday supplement focused on local issues and events; within two years it became the still-popular &quot;New York magazine&quot;.

Richard Wald, Fred W. Friendly Professor of Professional Practice in Media and Society at Columbia University (and former ABC News &quot;ethics czar&quot;) said, &quot;“Jim changed the way a lot of newspapers look today, in the sense of making a page of newsprint more inviting and understandable. And just as he made great innovations in how newspapers looked, he changed the way they read.”&quot;

Bellows&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Last Editor: How I saved the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times from Dullness and Complacency&quot; (2002), was also made into a PBS documentary. It chronicled his (mostly unsuccessful) fight to save the underdog papers at a time when newspapers were the dominant media in some of the most turbulent times of the United States. In the process, he claimed &quot;“The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; made &quot;The New York Times&quot; a livelier paper than it was before... &quot;The Washington Star&quot; made &quot;The Washington Post&quot; a less institutional paper. And the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was put on its mettle by the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot;...&quot;&quot;

He also held positions at &quot;USA Today: The Television Show&quot;, the Prodigy online news service, the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, and others.

==Singular accomplishments==
In April 1963, Bellows published Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; on the front page of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

While editor of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot;, intrigued by the absence of coverage for the shooting death of a 39-year-old black woman, Bellows initiated a major reporting examination of the conduct of the Los Angeles Police Department, a subject previously ignored or avoided by the area&#x27;s new outlets.

== Personal life ==
Bellows married Marian Raines with whom he had three daughters, Amelia, Priscilla and Felicia, prior to the couple&#x27;s divorce. He married Maggie Savoy, who died in 1970, and then Keven Ryan, with whom he had a daughter Justine.

==Death==
Bellows died on March 6, 2009, of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at a nursing home in Santa Monica.

<text>The Angolan Democratic Forum (&quot;Fórum Democrático Angolano&quot;) was a political party in Angola. The party was formed by UNITA dissidents in Canada. The chairman of FDA was Jorge Rebelo Pinto Chikoti. The FDA aligned with the Democratic Reflexion Tendency (TRD), which was then not constituted as a formal party. Leaders of TRD included Pablo Tchipilica, Miguel N&#x27;Zau Puna (former general secretary of UNITA) and Tony da Costa Fernandes.
FDA participated in the 1992 parliamentary election. Many TDR members were on its lists. The party obtained 12,038 votes (0.3%) and one seat in the National Assembly (Miguel N&#x27;Zau Puna). When Puna was nominated ambassador of Angola in Canada in 1997, his parliament seat was taken over by António Dias da Silva. In 2006, Dias da Silva was expelled from the parliament.

FDA has ceased to function, but TRD continues to exist.

<doc id="1188475" wikidata="Q558609" url="?curid=1188475" title="Vladimir Petlyakov">
<text>Vladimir Mikhailovich Petlyakov (; 15 June 1891 – 12 January 1942) was a Soviet aeronautical engineer and aircraft designer.

Petlyakov was born in 1891 in Sambek, Don Host Oblast, Russian Empire (now Neklinovsky District, Rostov Oblast), where his father served as a local official. After graduating from the Technical College in Taganrog (now &quot;Taganrog Petlyakov Aviation College&quot;, Таганрогский авиационный колледж им. В. М. Петлякова) in 1910. he travelled to Moscow, where he was accepted into the Moscow State Technical University; however, due to financial difficulties he was unable to complete his studies. After the 1917 Russian Revolution he continued his education and was hired to work as a technician in the aerodynamics laboratory at Moscow State Technical University under the guidance of Nikolai Zhukovsky, while resuming his studies. He gained experience as a laboratory assistant on wind tunnels and on calculations for aircraft design. In 1922 he graduated from the same university.

From 1921 to 1936 Petlyakov worked at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) () under the guidance of Andrei Tupolev; there he became involved in wing design and in the development of gliders. In 1936 he became a chief aircraft-designer at an aviation plant. Petlyakov was directly involved in the organization and development of Soviet metal aircraft construction. In particular, Petlyakov (together with the engineer Nikolai Belyaev) elaborated methods of calculating durability of materials and theory on designing metal wings with multiple spars. Petlyakov assisted in designing the first Soviet heavy bombers TB-1, TB-3 (1930–1935), and a long-range high-altitude four-engine bomber, the Pe-8 (1935–1937).

On 21 October 1937, Petlyakov, together with Tupolev and the entire directorate of the TsAGI, was arrested on trumped-up charges of sabotage, espionage and of aiding the Russian Fascist Party. Many of his colleagues were executed. In 1939 he was moved from a prison to an NKVD &quot;sharashka&quot; for aircraft designers near Moscow, where many ex-TsAGI people had already been sent to work. Petlyakov was given the task of designing a high-altitude fighter, which he successfully accomplished. Operational experience in the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939–1940 showed that this was not what the Soviet Air Force needed, and Lavrentiy Beria, head of the NKVD and of the &quot;sharashka&quot; system, ordered that the fighter be redesigned as a dive bomber, with the promise that Petlyakov and his colleagues would be released on its successful completion.

The resulting aircraft, the Pe-2, which went into serial production at the Kazan Aviation Plant, proved to be one of the most successful designs of World War II. Petlyakov was released in 1940, and was awarded a Stalin Prize in 1941. At Kazan, Petlyakov faced increasing difficulties, with many of his trained technicians and machinists conscripted into the Soviet military and sent to the front lines, which adversely affected the quality of production aircraft. He protested to Soviet senior leadership, and was on his way to Moscow in January 1942 (flying in a Pe-2), when he died in an air crash near Arzamas. His grave is at the Arskoe Cemetery in Kazan.

Vladimir Petlyakov received the Stalin prize (1941) and was awarded two Orders of Lenin and an Order of the Red Star.

<text>Kenneth Gary Albert (born February 2, 1968) is an American sportscaster, the son of NBA sportscaster Marv Albert and nephew of sportscasters Al Albert and Steve Albert. He is the only sportscaster who currently does play-by-play for all four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL).

==Early life==
Albert&#x27;s parents gave him a tape recorder for his fifth birthday to practice his broadcasting. On his sixth birthday in 1974, his father took him along to a New York Rangers game. One of the statisticians had to leave in the middle of the game, so Albert got to do the stats for the rest of the game. At 14, he became the official statistician for the Rangers on the radio. At 16, he wrote content for the Rangers program. Aside from his father, his idol was Vancouver Canucks play-by-play broadcaster Jim Robson. From 1981 to 1986, Albert, growing up in Sands Point, covered high school sports for the &quot;Port Washington News&quot; at Paul D. Schreiber High School, an Anton Community Newspapers publication.

Albert graduated from New York University in 1990 with a degree in broadcasting and journalism. He was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. Albert worked in the sports department at WNYU radio. While working there he was able to pick up his quick responses while announcing local games.

==Broadcasting career==
Albert is the primary radio and occasional TV voice of the New York Rangers, as well as a play-by-play announcer and field-level reporter for Fox&#x27;s coverage of Major League Baseball, the National Football League, and previously, the Sugar Bowl.

Previously, Albert was the radio broadcaster for the American Hockey League&#x27;s Baltimore Skipjacks from 1990 to 1992. He later handled TV play-by-play for the Washington Capitals and Washington Bullets (now the Washington Wizards), and was a part-time announcer on Washington Nationals telecasts in 2005. Additionally, he does TV play-by-play for the Washington Commanders (formerly the Washington Redskins) preseason games with Joe Theismann. Albert called the international broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI with Theismann.

When Fox had the network contract for the National Hockey League in the 1990s, Albert also worked on &quot;Fox NHL Saturday&quot; telecasts. Albert previously did play-by-play for the &quot;NHL on NBC&quot; and formerly with Versus (now called NBCSN). Albert called Game 1 of the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals for NBC, filling in for Mike Emrick, who was dealing with a death in the family. He has done work for NBC&#x27;s Olympics coverage, as a play-by-play announcer for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey at every Winter Olympic Games since Salt Lake City in 2002.

Albert has also done college basketball for ESPN Plus and is a substitute play-by-play announcer for televised New York Knicks games on MSG Network. For the 2011 playoffs, Albert broadcast for two playoff teams in the same market, doing the play-by-play for the New York Rangers on WEPN 1050 ESPN radio and filling in on MSG Network doing play-by-play for the New York Knicks.

Albert was the play-by-play announcer for the 2015 American League Division Series between the Texas Rangers and the Toronto Blue Jays. In the top of the 7th inning of Game 5, he helped explain the rule regarding the errant throw by Toronto Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin, which resulted in Texas scoring the go-ahead run. In the bottom of the inning, he called Jose Bautista&#x27;s go-ahead home run.

In 2016, Albert was nominated for the Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality, Play-by-Play in a list that included fellow Fox and NBC colleagues Kevin Burkhardt, eventual winner Mike Emrick, and even his own father.

After Emrick&#x27;s retirement, Albert became NBC&#x27;s lead play-by-play announcer for the 2020–21 NHL season, paired with Emrick&#x27;s long-time partner Eddie Olczyk, having previously filled in for Emrick in game one of the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals due to a death in the latter&#x27;s family. With NBC losing its NHL rights starting in the 2021–22 season, the pair moved to Turner Sports to serve in the same capacity.

Albert is a frequent guest on WNYU-FM&#x27;s sports talk program, &quot;The Cheap Seats&quot;. He has also made many appearances on the popular New York sports internet radio show &quot;Sports Heaven with Mark and Evan&quot;.

Albert has been an announcer with the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; since Fox acquired the rights to the NFL in 1994. On October 13, 2024, Albert became the first play-by-play broadcaster to call 500 regular season or postseason games for the same network; CBS&#x27;s Jim Nantz would reach the milestone later that year.

===Four sports in four days===
On October 25, 2009, Albert called the play-by-play of the Minnesota Vikings – Pittsburgh Steelers NFL game for Fox and then hosted the New York Yankees&#x27; locker room celebration after clinching the American League Championship Series that night. The following night he broadcast a Rangers game on radio, and on October 28, he called the play-by-play of the New York Knicks season opener on MSG Network.

==Personal life==
Albert currently resides in New Jersey with his wife of 20 years, Barbara (Wolf), and their two daughters, Amanda and Sydney. Albert was introduced to his wife by close friend and Baltimore sports reporter, Jerry Coleman.
Albert has frequently cited his love of all sports, but mainly hockey and basketball. He has cited baseball as the hardest sport to commentate.

Kenny Albert released his first book, an autobiography entitled &quot;A Mic For All Seasons&quot;, on October 10, 2023, with Triumph Publishing. The book documents his 30 years of broadcasting, citing stories about his career rise, relationships with broadcasters and athletes, and his family.

<doc id="1188480" wikidata="Q5445263" url="?curid=1188480" title="Ferrari Colombo engine">
<text>The Ferrari Colombo engine is a petrol fueled, water cooled, carburetted 60° V12 engine designed by Gioacchino Colombo and produced in numerous iterations by Italian automaker Ferrari between 1947 and 1988. The maker&#x27;s first homegrown engine, its linear successor is the Lampredi V12, which it far outlived, the last Lampredi being made in 1959.

Colombo, who had previously designed Alfa Romeos for Enzo Ferrari, placed bore centres at 90 mm apart, allowing for significant expansion. Displacements ranged from the diminutive debut that powered the 125S racer to the unit in the 1986 412i grand tourer. Significant updates were made in 1963 for the 330 series, featuring a redesigned block with wider, 94 mm, bore spacing.

Enzo Ferrari had long admired the V12 engines of Packard, Auto Union, and Alfa Romeo (where he was long employed), but his first car, the 1940 Auto Avio Costruzioni 815, used a Fiat derived straight-8. Development of the V12 Colombo engine continued long after Colombo had been replaced by Aurelio Lampredi as the company&#x27;s marquee engine designer. Although the Lampredi V12 was a real force for the company, it was Colombo&#x27;s engine which powered Ferrari to the forefront of high-performance automobiles through the 1950s and 1960s.


==125==

The first Ferrari-designed engine was the V12 125, the work of Gioacchino Colombo and assistants Giuseppe Busso and . The engine&#x27;s name, and the car powered by it, the 125 S sports racer, were derived from the tiny by cylinders. The single overhead camshaft 60° V design had one cam on each cylinder bank, two valves per cylinder, and three 30DCF Weber carburetors. A 7.5:1 compression ratio yielded at 6800 rpm. First appearing May 11, 1947, the engine allowed the company to claim six victories in 14 races that year.

Colombo and Ferrari had designed the engine with Formula One regulations in mind, and introduced it the next year in the company&#x27;s first F1 car, the 125 F1. This time, it was supercharged, in accordance with F1 dictates, for a total output of at 7,000 rpm. However, the single-stage Roots-type supercharger was incapable of producing the high-end power required to compete with the strong eight-cylinder Alfa Romeo 158 and four-cylinder Maserati 4CLT. Nevertheless, strong driving and a nimble chassis allowed the company to place third in its first outing, at the Valentino Grand Prix on September 5, 1948 and the company persevered in racing.

For 1949, the engine was further modified with dual overhead camshafts (though still two valves per cylinder) and a two-stage supercharger. This combination gave the car better top-end performance and the resulting gave it five Grand Prix wins. Development continued the following year, but the problematic superchargers were dropped in favor of larger displacement and Lampredi&#x27;s 275 engine superseded the original Colombo design.

Applications:
* 1947 Ferrari 125 S — 
* 1948 Ferrari 125 F1 — Single supercharger, 
* 1949–1950 Ferrari 125 F1 — Dual-stage supercharger, 

==58.8 mm stroke==

The early 166, 195, and 212 cars used Colombo V12s of varying sizes. All shared the same stroke, with 60, 65, and bores giving displacements of in the 166, in the 195 and in the 212, respectively. Output ranged from to .

===250===
One of the most common Colombo engines is the 250, which debuted in 1952 in the 250S and lasted through the 1963 330 America. It used a bore with the common Colombo stroke of for a total of .

Beginning with the famous 250 TR, &quot;Testa Rossa&quot; racing car, Ferrari began a new series of modifications to the Colombo 250 engine. The spark plugs were moved to the outside of the cylinder head, near the exhausts. This enabled Ferrari to introduce separate individual intake ports to use with the six two barrel Weber carburetors. Four cylinder head bolts per cylinder were introduced (instead of three) to cope with the added power.

These changes eventually were incorporated into the Ferrari road cars, beginning with the 250 GT SWB and the 250 GT Series II Pininfarina cars.

===275===
The final Colombo Ferrari was the 275. It used a variant of the V12 with a wide bore for up to .

==330==
The 1960 400 Superamerica replaced the previous model&#x27;s Lampredi engine with a Colombo. It diverged from the standard stroke with a stroke and bore. Output was with triple Weber carburetors.

Although the 1963 330 series also used a engine with the same bore and stroke as the 400 Superamerica, this engine was quite different. It used a wider bore spacing, paving the way for future displacement increases. The spark plugs were moved and a new water pump was used. The dynamo on the prior versions was replaced by an alternator.

==Four-cam==
The Colombo V12 was substantially reworked for 1967&#x27;s 275 GTB/4. It still used two valves per cylinder, but dual overhead cams were now used as well. In a departure from previous Ferrari designs, the valve angle was reduced three degrees to 54° for a more-compact head. The dual camshafts also allowed the valves to be aligned &quot;correctly&quot; (perpendicular to the camshaft) instead of offset as in SOHC Ferraris. It was a dry-sump design with a huge capacity. The engine retained the bore and stroke dimensions of the 275 model for of displacement. Output was at 8000 rpm and of torque at 6000 rpm with six 40 DCN 9 Weber carburetors.

==365==
The 330 Colombo engine was enlarged with an bore to for 1966&#x27;s 365 California, retaining single overhead cams and wet sump lubrication. A reworked engine with four camshafts was used in the &quot;GT/4&quot; models.
The 365 GTB/4 Daytona was the only 365 engined car featuring dry sump lubrication.

Applications:
* 1966–1967 365 California
* 1968–1970 365 GTC
* 1968–1972 365 GT 2+2
* 1968–1973 365 GTB/4 Daytona, 365 GTS/4 Daytona
* 1969 365 GTS
* 1971–1972 365 GTC/4
* 1972–1976 365 GT4 2+2

== 400, 412==
The wet sump, four-cam, 365 Colombo engine was enlarged again to for 1976&#x27;s 400 with the same bore and a stroke. The carburetors were replaced with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection in 1979. In 1986 the engine was bored to giving a displacement of .

Applications:
* 1976–1979 400
* 1979–1985 400i
* 1986–1988 412i

<doc id="1188482" wikidata="Q7561696" url="?curid=1188482" title="Sonia Dada">
<text>Sonia Dada was an American rock, soul, and rhythm and blues band, formed in Chicago in 1990. Founding member Daniel Pritzker enlisted Michael Scott, Paris Delane, and Sam Hogan after hearing the latter three sing in a subway station. Sonia Dada has become a mainstay of the Chicago musical scene in the years since, incorporating elements of rock, soul, gospel, and funk.

Their 1992 debut album, &quot;Sonia Dada&quot;, produced a major radio hit, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Treat Me No Good&quot;, and sold more than 100,000 copies. The album peaked at number 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers chart in 1993. In 1994, the band&#x27;s tour saw them opening for the group Traffic, as well as headlining an extremely successful Australian tour. The album reached number two on the Australian ARIA charts and was the 13th highest-selling album for the year of 1993. The single &quot;You Don&#x27;t Treat Me No Good&quot; spent four weeks at number one on the ARIA singles chart and was the third highest-selling single for the same year, while &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Thinking (About Me)&quot; was the 40th highest-selling single. However, they are known primarily as a one-hit wonder in Australia. On the Australian ARIA charts, &quot;You Aint Thinking (About Me)&quot; reached number three.

Since then, Sonia Dada has released four studio albums and a live album. Their 2004 release, &quot;Test Pattern&quot;, was released in a deluxe edition with a bonus DVD containing short films by Jeth Weinrich.

<doc id="1188488" wikidata="Q4894021" url="?curid=1188488" title="Botswana Congress Party">
<text>The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) is a social democratic political party in Botswana. Founded in 1998 as a result of a split from the Botswana National Front (BNF), the party attracted most of the BNF&#x27;s sitting MPs due to a leadership dispute involving the BNF&#x27;s leader, Kenneth Koma.

== History==
The BCP was formed by 11 sitting MPs and immediately became the official opposition in parliament. Party president Michael Dingake served as Leader of the Opposition until parliament was dissolved in advance of the 1999 general elections. In the 1999 general elections, the BCP won 11.9% of the vote and retained only one seat (out of 40). In the elections, 30 October 2004, the party won 16.6% of the popular vote and one out of 57 seats. The sole BCP member of parliament was Dumelang Saleshando, the son of then BCP president, Gilson Saleshando.

In 2009, the party contested the 2009 election in a pact with the Botswana Alliance Movement. However, talks to form an alliance with the Botswana National Front proved fruitless.

The 2009 elections proved a decisive success for the party. The BCP won 19.2% of the popular vote and four parliamentary seats. Its 19.2% popular vote makes it the third largest political movement in Botswana. The BCP retained the Gaborone Central constituency and won the Chobe, Okavango, and Selebi Phikwe West constituencies from the BDP. Pact partner BAM won 2.3% of the vote and defeated the former Minister of Education and Skills Development, Jacob Nkate, in the Ngami constituency. Despite its losses to the BCP, the BDP won enough constituencies from the BNF to increase its overall representation by one seat.

In May 2010, the BCP and the BAM merged under the BCP label with a new party symbol that incorporates elements of the parent parties. Following the merger, the BCP controlled five seats in the National Assembly.
On 4 September 2010, the BCP contested by elections in Tonota North constituency with the support of the other three opposition parties, Botswana National Front (BNF), Botswana Peoples Party (BPP) and the BDP breakaway party Botswana Movement for Democracy (BMD). The BCP candidate increased her vote share slightly, to 36.1%, but lost to the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP).The party recently lost a key member, Member of parliament for Okavango Hon Bagalatia Aaron, who defected to the ruling Botswana Democratic Party.

<text>Maurice Colbourne (24 September 1939 – 4 August 1989) was an English stage and television actor who starred as Tom Howard in the BBC television series &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;. He is also known for roles in other television series such as &quot;Gangsters&quot;, &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;, &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was usually cast as a villain in his career.

== Early life ==

Maurice Colbourne was born Roger Middleton in Sheffield, three weeks after Britain and France declared war on Germany upon the outbreak of the Second World War, and studied acting at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He took his stage name from that of an earlier film actor called Maurice Colbourne (24 September 1894 – 22 September 1965), who shared the same birthday (in a different year) as his.

== Career ==

In 1972, Colbourne co-founded, together with Michael Irving and Guy Sprung, the Half Moon Theatre near Aldgate, east London. This was a successful, radical theatre company, performing initially in an 80-seat disused synagogue in Half Moon Passage, E1. In 1985, the company moved to a converted chapel in Mile End Road, near Stepney Green. He performed in many productions at Half Moon Theatre, including &quot;In the Jungle of the Cities, Will Wat, If Not, What Will?&quot;, &quot;Heroes of the Iceberg Hotel&quot;, &quot;Sawdust Caesar&quot;, &quot;Dan Dare&quot; and &quot;Chaste Maid in Cheapside.&quot; He also directed several productions, including &quot;Silver Tassie&quot;, &quot;Alkestis&quot;, &quot;The Shoemakers&quot; and &quot;Pig Bank&quot;. He returned in 1979 to perform in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

Colbourne first became well known when he played the lead in a BBC drama series, &quot;Gangsters&quot;, from 1975–78, and afterwards appeared regularly on television. This included a guest appearance in a 1977 episode of &quot;Van der Valk&quot;, &quot;Everybody Does It&quot;. He played Charles Marston, the love interest of Lady Fogarty, in the seventh series of &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; screened from 22 July to 23 September 1979. He played a mercenary in an episode of the &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; called &quot;Duel in Venice&quot;. He played the character Jack Coker in the BBC&#x27;s television miniseries adaptation of John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1981). He also twice appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the character Lytton (in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984) and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985)).

Colbourne played lead character Tom Howard in 61 episodes of the successful BBC television drama &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; from 1985 to 1989. During a break in filming of the fifth series, he died aged 49 from a heart attack while renovating a holiday home in Dinan, Brittany, France. The programme continued to the end of series five and for a sixth series, to tie up the storylines, with Colbourne&#x27;s character being written out of the scripts.

<text>Rodenbach is a brewery in Roeselare, Belgium, now owned by Palm Breweries. It is noted for its barrel-aged sour beers in the Flemish red style.

==Brewery==
In 1821, the four Rodenbach brothers (Pedro, Alexander, Ferdinand and Constantijn) invested in a small brewery in Roeselare, in the West Flanders province of Belgium. The brothers agreed to a partnership for fifteen years. At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864), and it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth.

Edward&#x27;s son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbachs until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.

After the take-over, Palm quickly stopped production of Rodenbach&#x27;s Alexander beer, a cherry-flavoured beer. However, in recent years, Palm/Rodenbach has produced and distributed, first, Rodenbach foederbier, which is served only from cask, and is unfiltered and unblended. It comes straight from an oak riping barrel and is not processed further. More recently, the brewery has produced Vin de Céréale, sold only in bottles. This is similar to foederbier, but has been in the barrel longer (about three years) and has been formulated for more alcohol. Foederbier is usually 5-6 percent, while Vin de Céréale is 10 percent.

From 1980 until 2000, Rodenbach supplied the yeast and bacteria culture that provided their distinctive taste profile and sourness to De Dolle Brouwers in nearby Esen for use in some of their beers. They had historically also sometimes supplied yeast to Westvleteren Brewery and Brouwerij Felix in Oudenaarde.

==Beers==

There are several different types of Rodenbach beers:
* &quot;Rodenbach Original&quot; (5.2% ABV) blended from aged and young ale (25%/75%)
* &quot;Rodenbach Grand Cru&quot;, a winey beer (6% ABV) which contains less young ale (67%/33%)
* &quot;Rodenbach Vintage beer&quot;, this beer is unblended aged beer from a single cask selected for its qualities by a tasting panel, formerly sold as &quot;Grand Cru&quot;
* &quot;Vin de Céréale&quot;, an aged beer that is 10% ABV
* &quot;Caractère Rouge&quot;, beer, already having undergone maturation, that is put through further aging and maceration with cherries, raspberries, and cranberries

In commemoration of the brewery&#x27;s 150th year of activity, it produced &quot;Rodenbach Alexander&quot;, a variant of Original with cherry flavor. Its name comes from the brewery founder, Alexandre Rodenbach.

<text>Louis dressing is a salad dressing based on mayonnaise, to which red chili sauce, minced green onions, and minced green chili peppers have been added. It is commonly used as a dressing for salads featuring seafood, such as a crab (Crab Louis, the King of Salads) or shrimp (Shrimp Louis).

==Origin==
The origin of the dressing is disputed. The Olympic Club in Seattle, The Davenport Hotel in Spokane, Washington, Solari&#x27;s Restaurant, Bergez-Frank&#x27;s Old Poodle Dog Restaurant and the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, and the Bohemian in Portland all claim to be the home of the dressing, with the invention in either the 1900s or 1910s. In all cases, the original salad was made with Dungeness crab.

From &quot;The American Heritage Cookbook&quot; published 1964:

* mayonnaise
* chili sauce
* 2 Tbsp finely diced or grated onion
* 2 Tbsp fresh parsley, chopped fine
* A pinch or two of cayenne
* heavy cream, whipped

The first five ingredients are combined and the whipped cream folded in.

<text>The Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA and variously translated as African Democratic Assembly and African Democratic Rally, was a political party in French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa which was important in the decolonization of the French empire. The RDA was composed of different political parties throughout the French colonies in Africa and lasted from 1946 until 1958. At certain points, the RDA was the largest political party in the colonies in Africa and played a key role in the French government headed by the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR). Although the regional party largely dissolved in 1958 with the independence votes for the colonies, many of the national parties retained the RDA in their name and some continue to do so. The political ideology of the party did not endorse outright secession of colonies from France, but it was anti-colonial and pan-Africanist in its political stances.

The RDA was formed at a conference in Bamako, in the colony of French Sudan, in 1946. The aim of the conference was to unite African leaders affiliated with the French Socialist Party with those affiliated with the French Communist Party together to work on reconfiguring the relationship between France and the African colonies. However, the French Socialist leaders in France saw the proposal as undermining their relationships and so forced their African members to withdraw from the conference. The result was that the resulting party was exclusively supported by the Communist Party, a situation which shaped the early positions of the party and its political opportunities. The leader of the party from this first conference until the very end was Félix Houphouët-Boigny of the Ivory Coast. Because of the withdrawal of the socialists from the party, the RDA was initially in a coalition with the French Communist Party in the French National Assembly. However, this coalition alienated many RDA delegates who eventually split with the RDA and formed the rival Indépendants d&#x27;Outre-Mer (IOM) party. Continued French hostility to the RDA, a weakening of the Communist Party in France, and the defection of delegates to the IOM, resulted in the RDA ending its coalition with the communists and joining the small Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR).

Following a number of years of electoral defeats and French repression of the party, the RDA returned to prominence in regional politics by performing very well in the 1956 and 1957 elections throughout the colonies. The RDA became the largest political party in French Africa and the largest group in the UDSR which allowed Houphouët-Boigny to become a prominent French minister after the 1956 elections. As minister, Houphouët-Boigny crafted the 1958 option to the colonies to vote for immediate independence or to join a community linking the colonies with France but with increased autonomy. The vote, however, divided the RDA over the issues of independence and federalism and the party largely split. Despite the breakup of the party after the 1958 vote, the national parties and the connections established regionally through the party remained important. The RDA parties in Guinea and Mali, which were the dominant parties in those countries during and after independence, joined together with the former British colony of Ghana to form the Union of African States. In contrast, the Ivory Coast, Niger and Dahomey were joined together with the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente in the era after independence.

==Political context==
With the end of World War II, the French colonial empire set about a significant reorganization of the relationship between France and the colonies. Before the establishment of the French Fourth Republic, the only colony in French West Africa or French Equatorial Africa with any elections for political authorities was Senegal. The rest of the colonies had few Africans who were considered citizens of France, no elections, and suppression of most political movements.

With the establishment of the French Union () in 1946 all of the colonies of French Africa (except for the trusteeship of Togo) became overseas departments which would provide to the colonies expanded citizenship, the right to elect members to the French National Assembly, and some limited autonomy for local councils. The 1946 French elections in June largely split the legislature between a coalition of the Popular Republican Movement ( or MRP) the French Communist Party ( or PCF), and the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International ( or SFIO). This split meant that each party needed to court African deputies to the National Assembly in order to further their legislative causes. The SFIO was the only party with actual party branches established in the African colonies, while the Communist party had established Groupes d’Etudes Communistes (Communist Study Groups) in many of the capitals of the African colonies in 1943 and the MRP had various networks arranged by the church.

Combined with the need for African deputies by the main French political parties, many African leaders believed that the pathway to improved conditions for the colonies lay largely in working with the French government rather than leading revolutionary movements. The result was a marriage of convenience linking the French political parties with newly elected African deputies. While the SFIO had the most institutionalized linkages to African political leaders prior to 1946, many leaders felt that the &quot;assimilation&quot; pathway which the SFIO had helped write into the constitution of the Fourth Republic did not provide enough for the African colonies.

More globally, the issue of independence from colonial rule had become a prominent topic throughout Africa and Asia. Many British and UN Trusteeship colonies in Africa had begun the process towards independence in the mid-1940s. Ghana constantly served as an example giving rise to demands by political movements in French West Africa throughout the 1950s. During the same period, violent anti-colonial struggles reached significant levels in many other French colonies: including the Malagasy Uprising in Madagascar and violence in the First Indochina War in Vietnam.

==Formation: 1946==
Within the context of a realignment between France and the colonies, one of the elected deputies pushing most significantly for increased autonomy of the colonies was Félix Houphouët-Boigny of the Ivory Coast colony. Houphouët-Boigny had spent a brief period as a delegate in the French National Assembly, where he had aligned most closely with the French Communist Party and had taken an active role in trying to get the recall of André-Jean-Gaston Latrille, the French governor of the Ivory Coast. Following the collapse of the National Assembly elected in July 1946 and wanting to establish a pan-African party in the National Assembly, Houphouët-Boigny convinced Lamine Guèye of Senegal (who was the most prominent socialist in Africa at the time) to work towards establishing a wider political movement with the goal of autonomy for the colonies of Africa. These two leaders then brought together many of the other African delegates in the National Assembly to sign a manifesto calling for all leaders to come to Bamako (today the capital of Mali) for a meeting to establish a regional political party. In addition to Houphouët-Boigny and Guèye, the leaders who signed this manifesto were: Jean-Félix Tchicaya from French Congo, Sourou-Migan Apithy from French Dahomey, Fily Dabo Sissoko from French Sudan, Yacine Diallo from Guinea, and Gabriel d&#x27;Arboussier from Senegal. Although he did not sign it at the time of its composition, Léopold Sédar Senghor from Senegal openly endorsed the contents of the letter.

The congress was held from 18 to 21 October 1946. However, the start of the conference was undermined as a result of French Socialist opposition and conflict between some of the members. The Communist party offered full support to the meeting, which only led the other parties to approach the meeting with suspicion. Most importantly the Socialist Minister of colonial affairs, Marius Moutet, viewed the meeting as a threat to his colonial policies and thus instructed his allies not to attend and for colonial authorities to do what they could to hinder the meeting. Moutet convinced some of the signatories of the document to renounce the manifesto and persuaded Guèye, Senghor, and Diallo not to attend. In addition, the colonial authorities confiscated Tchicaya&#x27;s funds for travel. The result was that the 800 delegates who did arrive included few socialist moderates and instead was dominated by those who sought to align the party with the communists. Reflecting on the way this shaped the party, Houphouët-Boigny recalled in 1952 that &quot;If Lamine and Senghor had been at Bamako, we would have written another page of history.&quot;

The conference also got off to a rocky start as a result of the different factions in the French Sudan colony which was hosting the conference. When Houphouët-Boigny, Apithy, and d&#x27;Arboussier arrived on the morning of 18 October at the airport in Bamako (in a plane which was formerly the private plane of Hermann Göring and was provided by the communist party) they were greeted by a hostile Sissoko, worried the party would give support to other French Sudanese political leaders and weaken his leadership. Sissoko, as the host of the conference, refused to open up the discussion. Eventually pressure from within his own political party and from the leaders assembled led him to agree to open the meeting at 4:00 PM (although he insisted on calling it &quot;your congress&quot; and not &quot;our congress&quot; throughout his opening speech).

The conference agreed to a few different issues. First, they agreed to form a regional political alliance among many of their different movements. Rather than a regional party which would have a significant regional infrastructure, the members viewed it as an alliance of the different political forces operating in each of the colonies. Thus they created a Committee of Coordination to be tasked with selecting which party in each colony would be the representative of the RDA party and named Houphouët-Boigny as chairman and Sissoko, Apithy, Tchicaya, d&#x27;Arboussier, and Mamadou Konate (the key Malian politician who convinced Sissoko to join the meeting) as vice-chairmen. Second, as the parties&#x27; main activity would be in the National Assembly, there were active discussions about what coalitions to form with French political parties. The debate largely focused on whether to form a permanent coalition with the Communist party or to align with them while they served RDA interests. The group agreed to compromise language that the party would form coalitions with whichever party was most useful for African issues. Third, although it was briefly mentioned, the conference agreed not to call for complete independence of the colonies, but instead for an end to the unequal colonial relationship with France. Although the party was to be anti-colonial and focus on increased autonomy for the French colonies, they were not advocating secession or withdrawal from France as an immediate goal.

==Divisions: 1947–49==

Although they only had a month to organize for the French legislative elections in November 1946, they were able to secure a number of seats by using the political organizations established by the various members. The National Assembly votes in France once again supported the three party center-left coalition of the MRP (29% of the vote), the PCF (28.6% of the vote) and the SFIO (16.5% of the vote). In French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, the RDA was able to win 10 seats for the National Assembly: with members being Houphouët-Boigny, Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly, and Zinda Kaboré from the Ivory Coast (which included the Upper Volta at this point), Apithy represented Dahomey (present-day Benin), Tchicaya represented the Middle Congo (present-day Republic of the Congo), Konate represented French Sudan, Hamani Diori represented Niger, Gabriel Lisette represented Chad, Martin Aku from Togo, and Mamba Sano from Guinea. The Socialists won six seats with continued support in Senegal (where Guèye and Senghor were both elected to positions) and from other longtime supporters like Sissoko and an associate from the French Sudan, who had left the RDA right after the meeting, and Diallo from Guinea. Because the second college of the National Assembly was not directly elected, the Socialist party was able to use political strategies to secure 12 of the 20 seats from West and Equatorial Africa in the 1947 election (including making Moutet himself a representative from the French Sudan).

When the RDA members arrived in Paris, they were provided significant support and advice from the Communist party (and particularly Aimé Césaire from Martinique) which relied significantly on their voting block. This bond was further strengthened when the coalition government named Popular Republican Movement politician Paul Coste-Floret as the Ministre de la France d&#x27;Outre-mer governing the colonies. Coste-Floret began an era of very rigid policy towards the colonies and particularly towards movements perceived to be pushing for independence. However, two changes served to exacerbate divisions within the membership of the RDA. First, in May 1947 the coalition between the MRP, the SFIO, and the Communists had dissolved. It is important to note that this dissolution coincides with American financing of Europe, including France, in the post-World War II period. The United States warned European nations that they would not receive financial support to reconstruct their nations if communist parties were a part of their ruling governmental bodies. This introduced significant differences between the parties which had before been set aside and meant that the Communists saw decreasing power to offer their RDA allies. Second, the French divided the Upper Volta from the Ivory Coast in order to try and reduce the power of Houphouët-Boigny and the RDA. The plan appeared to work when in 1948, Zinda Kaboré was killed and the Mossi chiefs in Upper Volta, who had renounced the RDA and connected with the MRP, were able to appoint Nazi Boni to fill the position.

These two factors combined to make many of the National Assembly delegates, particularly those with large Catholic constituencies in their colonies, feel uneasy about the coalition with the Communist party. Apithy, from Dahomey, in particular raised the issue many times and when his efforts to end the coalition failed, he formed a new regional political party in September 1948, the Indépendants d&#x27;Outre-Mer (IOM). The IOM included Apithy, the three new members from the Upper Volta, and three other members from throughout West and Equatorial Africa. The formation of the IOM coincided precisely with the naming of a new Prime Minister, Robert Schuman, to present his cabinet in what would be a very close vote. During the debate on this cabinet, Apithy presented Schuman with a number of questions regarding the future of the colonial arrangement. When Schuman gave the closing speech before a vote to confirm his cabinet, Apithy&#x27;s questions were the only ones which he did not address at all. Apithy was infuriated by this perceived slight and so cast the whole seven votes of the IOM (including those of the three absent Upper Volta members) against the cabinet. Schuman lost by six votes and was replaced by Radical Party politician Henri Queuille. Queille made a point of meeting with Apithy before the presentation of his cabinet and answered all of his questions in his first speech to the National Assembly.

In 1948, the IOM increased its membership in the French National Assembly by adding members from the RDA, the Socialist block, and MRP politicians. However, the IOM also saw a change in leadership as Apithy was replaced with Louis-Paul Aujoulat as a result of dissatisfaction by the Upper Volta members who wanted their votes cast to support the MRP government of Schuman. These changes brought the IOM closer to the MRP while the RDA remained tied to the Communist party. The antagonisms between the French parties resulted in antagonism between their African allies. The rise of the IOM meant that the RDA no longer had party affiliates and any significant presence in Togo or French Dahomey, and weakened colony affiliates elsewhere. At the same time that the IOM was increasing in strength, the Socialist party in Senegal saw a split between Guèye and Senghor with the later creating a new party, the Senegalese Democratic Bloc (, BDS), which he aligned with the IOM movement. This split made the alignment of parties in the National Assembly much more complex and allowed options for new groupings between the different factions.

By 1948, the RDA had active parties as a primary faction in six of the colonies of French Africa: Ivory Coast, Middle Congo, Ubangi-Shari, Chad, Guinea, and in French Sudan. At the same time, it was actively suppressed in Upper Volta and French Sudan by the opposition parties.

In response to these shifting political environments, the RDA held its second party congress in January 1949 in Treichville, Ivory Coast. The congress appointed Houphouët-Boigny as the President of the party and named d&#x27;Arboussier as the General Secretary. The main issue for debate was the alliance with the Communists in France with d&#x27;Arboussier arguing that the alliance was necessary but a number of other members questioning the alliance. However the issue was not resolved at the second party congress.

==Chaos in the Ivory Coast: 1949==
Unlike other parts of the French empire (notably Madagascar and Indochina), independence movements in French Africa had remained largely peaceful. This changed in 1949 when French authorities used divisions between Houphouët-Boigny and other politicians to begin active and violent suppression of the RDA in the colony.

The catalyst for the chaos was the removal of Étienne Djaument by Houphouët-Boigny from the RDA in early 1949. Djaument responded by forming a rival party, the Bloc Démocratique Eburnén. At the first meeting of this rival congress, supporters of Houphouët-Boigny responded with protests or rioting and in the resulting clash one person was killed and a number were injured. The French authorities, and the French colonists in the colony, used this opportunity to foment general unrest between the RDA party and its opponents and then used the unrest to justify the arrest of RDA members and violent suppression of party activities. This pattern of partisan outbursts, French violence against RDA supporters at these incidents, and the mass arrests of RDA supporters continued throughout 1949 and into early 1950. Although an arrest warrant was issued for Houphouët-Boigny, he was able to use immunity as a member of the National Assembly to avoid arrest. In December 1949, the RDA and its supporters began a general strike involving many different groups of workers, a boycott of European goods sold in the country, and a hunger strike in the prisons. The tension came to a head on 28 January 1950 when Victor Biaka Boda, an RDA member of the National Assembly, disappeared in the Ivory Coast. Upset by this event, the RDA held a protest in Dimbokro which resulted in a French army shooting of 13 Ivorian civilians. The next day (February 1), the French declared all RDA meetings illegal throughout all of French West Africa. The end result of the year of violence was over 50 dead and 3000 RDA partisans imprisoned.

Although RDA members of the National Assembly stopped going to sessions because they were largely ignored, following the French Army shooting in Dimbokro, Senghor led much of the African membership to demand an inquiry into the incident. The French government secretly informed RDA politicians in March that it had no intentions of implementing the 1 February decree banning all activities by the RDA and gradually the tension relaxed.

==Break with the Communists (1950–55)==

Following the end to the chaos in the Ivory Coast, Houphouët-Boigny began to see the alliance with the Communist party in France as counterproductive to his larger goals. He began meetings simultaneously with both the IOM legislators and the radical wing of the RDA, led by d&#x27;Arboussier who he convinced to resign his position in the party. On 9 August 1950, the RDA and the IOM entered into a secret accord aiming to bring together the two groups in the French National Assembly, based primarily on the RDA ending their coalition with the Communist party. In domestic politics in the colonies, it was decided that the IOM and the RDA would largely retain power in the colonies which they controlled and thus prevent political conflict. The IOM was to be the main political party of the union in Guinea, Dahomey, Togo, Senegal (as Senghor had now joined the IOM), Upper Volta, Cameroon, and Ubangi-Shari while the RDA would be the representative of the alliance in French Sudan, Ivory Coast, Chad, and the Middle Congo. As both had a member of the National Assembly from Niger, the agreement was to keep that colony split. After this &quot;rapprochement&quot; between the two parties, the RDA broke with the Communist party and in December 1950 voted for the government of René Pleven. This would begin a long relationship between Pleven&#x27;s party, the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (, UDSR), and particularly with the young politician François Mitterrand, and the RDA.

Although Mitterrand tried to change French policy towards the RDA, the colonial administration was still focused primarily on removing the RDA from any power it had remaining. In preparation for the 1951 French elections, RDA supporters were removed from voter rolls by French authorities, areas with high RDA support experienced a number of voting problems, and members were arrested and intimidated from political activity. All this resulted in a significant loss to the RDA throughout Africa and only Houphouët-Boigny, Konate, and Tchicaya were National Assembly members from the RDA following the election. In the same election, the IOM gained most consistently becoming the largest political party in Africa. Although electoral results showed significant support of the IOM over the RDA, the IOM remained largely a legislative coalition in Paris with limited support as a regional party in Africa. The RDA, in contrast, continued its efforts to build broad political bases and build the national RDA parties throughout Africa.

The result of these efforts was that the RDA saw increasing power from 1951 until 1955. This was most punctuated with the rise in Guinea of Sékou Touré to political prominence as the head of the Democratic Party of Guinea . As a union organizer, Touré had significant ties with the Communists throughout French West Africa and thus connected quickly with the Communist-affiliated members of the RDA. His importance to the RDA&#x27;s wider objectives was so large that he was named the head of the RDA coalition in the National Assembly in 1953. In the 1955 meeting of the Coordinating Council the party similarly consolidated around the new party identity. First, they decided that Ruben Um Nyobé&#x27;s Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) was no longer affiliated with the RDA because of its radical positions against the French state. Second, it settled a dispute in Niger with multiple parties claiming to be the RDA affiliate: supporting Hamani Diori&#x27;s party over that of Djibo Bakary. The party building activities set the RDA up to perform well in the upcoming election.

==Return to power and dissolution: 1956–58==

Without the active suppression of earlier elections and the end of the temporary IOM-RDA rapprochement, the RDA became the largest party from the African colonies earning nine seats in the French legislative elections of 1956 (from only having 3 in the period of 1951-1955). The IOM saw the largest losses going from having fourteen deputies to only seven. The remaining seats saw six deputies go to persons allied with the Gaullist Party, four deputies allied with the Socialist party, and two who affiliated with Catholic conservatives (Apithy and Barthélemy Boganda). The RDA legislators were now more than half of the total membership of the UDSR party, which actually resulted in the party changing its name to the UDSR-RDA during this period. Because of this, when the IOM tried once again to form an alliance with the RDA, they were rebuffed because the RDA had a solid alliance with significant power and the IOM wanted to remain with the MRP. In addition, because of the important role of the RDA within the UDSR, Houphouët-Boigny was able to become a Minister within the French cabinet, the first representative from French West Africa or French Equatorial Africa to achieve this. Further empowering the RDA during this time was a shift in the French colonial administration not wanting to see additional colonial violence like had been experienced in Madagascar, Indochina, and Algeria.

During this time, the French political parties passed the &quot;Loi Cadre&quot; which significantly reformed the relationship between France and the colonies by granting expanded power to Territorial Assemblies in each colony. Because the reform did not go far enough in expanding self-rule to the colonies, the African legislators largely opposed it. The Socialists were the only political faction to vote for the law and although Houphouët-Boigny was required to vote for it because of his ministerial post, he organized to have the RDA vote against the legislation. Despite this opposition, the legislation passed and Territorial Assembly elections were held in March 1957. For these elections, the IOM had reformed itself into the African Convention (), in order to try to have a larger domestic base. The only other regional party of significance for these elections was a newly focused set of Socialist politicians.

In the 1957 Territorial Assembly elections, the RDA gained clear majorities in Guinea, Chad, the Ivory Coast, and, under the new leadership of Modibo Keïta, the French Sudan. Of the 474 seats up for election, 236 went to RDA politicians (49.79%), 62 went to the Socialists, 58 went to the African Convention, and the rest were split between national parties without regional influence in Mauritania and Dahomey.

From this position of power, Houphouët-Boigny called for a Third Party Congress to bring together all the members. The last party congress had been in 1949 and, despite calls for an open congress from the Communist wing of the RDA for years, it had been resisted by the party leadership. The main debate at the congress focused on the issue of federalism and the relationship with France for the future. Houphouët-Boigny, who saw the Congress as an opportunity to show off political power to his French guests (including Mitterrand) in attendance, argued that the colonies should enter into a federal relationship with France remaining the center of political life. Touré and Keïta, the younger RDA leaders, in contrast pushed for an independent African federation. The situation led to many embarrassing political votes for Houphouët-Boigny and eventually the adoption of a compromise position that the party would commit itself to working for democratization of any federal arrangements which existed.

When many of the other parties in West and Equatorial Africa proposed another attempt at rapprochement between the parties, the RDA responded with little enthusiasm. This eventually led to the creation of the African Regroupment Party (, PRA) which would serve as a rival to the RDA between the various other parties: including bringing together the African Convention and the Socialists. By mid-1958, French Africa along the Atlantic had developed largely a two-party system.

With the dissolution of the French Fourth Republic, the RDA became a key party shaping the colonial relationship that would exist in the next French state. DeGaulle appointed Houphouët-Boigny to assist in developing the specific laws for the new constitution which would govern the colonies. Houphouët-Boigny pushed for a strong federation linking France with the colonies, while the PRA, led by Senghor, pushed for a looser confederation arrangement. In a meeting on 18 July 1958, the PRA and RDA agreed that the eventual arrangement must include the right to self-determination for the colonies. 

This resulted in a law which would give each colony the right to vote to join a newly organized French Community which would keep the colonies linked to France but also provide some degree of self-rule, or to declare independence immediately. The RDA was divided on this position. The leaders with the most linkages to the trade-unions, mainly Touré in Guinea, generally believed that it was best for the French colonies to declare independence immediately. Houphouët-Boigny and others, instead, pushed for joining the French Community and remaining very close with France. In addition, the Ivory Coast, as the wealthiest colony in French West Africa, opposed the proposal from Keïta that the colonies should become independent together as an African federation. Mortimer claims that the key person holding the party together and working towards a compromise had been Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly who died suddenly on 7 September, thus sealing the fate of the party.

The result was that the RDA, as a regional party, essentially ended with the independence vote in 1958. Guinea was the only country to vote for independence, incurring the immediate wrath of DeGaulle and Houphouët-Boigny who cut off aid to the colony and the French removed all personnel and equipment that was in the colony. Ivory Coast voted for the French Community and Houphouët-Boigny became a leader of the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente, a block of countries including the Ivory Coast, Niger, Upper Volta, and Dahomey which worked to maintain connections to France while becoming independent. French Sudan initially joined a brief federation with Senegal called the Mali Federation, bringing RDA leader Keïta and PRA leader Senghor together. However, this broke apart and the French Sudan (now the independent country called Mali) instead joined an informal grouping with Ghana and Guinea called the Union of African States which pushed for pan-African alternatives to Senghor&#x27;s socialism and the Conseil de l&#x27;Entente continued linkages with France. Although the name Rassemblement Démocratique Africain and identification with this regional grouping remained in many of the local parties, the RDA as a regional party would never form again after the vote of 1958.

==Coalitions with political parties==
The RDA maintained ties with a number of parties in France and in West Africa. Brief rapprochements with African parties never formed into solid coalitions, but the relationships with some French political parties lasted for many years. These included formal coalitions, brief partnerships, and loose affiliations. In addition, a number of parties opposed the RDA and worked against the party.

<doc id="1188531" wikidata="Q1916614" url="?curid=1188531" title="Medical model of disability">
<text>The medical model of disability, or medical model, is based in a biomedical perception of disability. This model links a disability diagnosis to an individual&#x27;s physical body. The model supposes that a disability may reduce the individual&#x27;s quality of life and aims to correct or diminish the disability with medical intervention. It is often contrasted with the social model of disability.

The medical model focuses on curing or managing illness or disability. By extension, the medical model supposes a compassionate or just society invests resources in health care and related services in an attempt to cure or manage disabilities &quot;medically&quot;. This is in an aim to expand or improve functioning, and to allow disabled people to lead a more &quot;normal&quot; life. The medical profession&#x27;s responsibility and potential in this area is seen as central.

== History ==
Before the introduction of the biomedical model, patients relaying their narratives to the doctors was paramount. Through these narratives and developing an intimate relationship with the patients, the doctors would develop treatment plans in a time when diagnostic and treatment options were limited. This could particularly be illustrated with aristocratic doctors treating the elite during the 17th and 18th century.

In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a framework for working with disability, publishing the &quot;International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps&quot;. The framework proposed to approach disability by using the terms Impairment, Handicap and Disability.
* Impairment = a loss or abnormality of physical bodily structure or function, of logic-psychic origin, or physiological or anatomical origin
*Disability = any limitation or function loss deriving from impairment that prevents the performance of an activity in the time lapse considered normal for a human being
*Handicap = the disadvantaged condition deriving from impairment or disability limiting a person performing a role considered normal in respect of age, sex and social and cultural factors

=== Components and usage ===
While personal narrative is present in interpersonal interactions, and particularly dominant in Western Culture, personal narrative during interactions with medical personnel is reduced to relaying information about specific symptoms of the disability to medical professionals. The medical professionals then interpret the information provided about the disability by the patient to determine a diagnosis, which likely will be linked to biological causes. Medical professionals now define what is &quot;normal&quot; and what is &quot;abnormal&quot; in terms of biology and disability.

In some countries, the medical model of disability has influenced legislation and policy pertaining to persons with disabilities on a national level.

The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), published in 2001, defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition (such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and depression) and personal and environmental factors (such as negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports). 

The altered language and words used show a marked change in emphasis from talking in terms of disease or impairment to talking in terms of levels of health and functioning. It takes into account the social aspects of disability and does not see disability only as a &#x27;medical&#x27; or &#x27;biological&#x27; dysfunction. That change is consistent with widespread acceptance of the social model of disability.

==Criticism==

The medical model focuses on individual intervention and treatment as the proper approach to disability. Emphasis is placed on the biological expression of disability rather than on the systems and structures that can inhibit the lives of people with disabilities. Under the medical model, disabled bodies are defined as something to be corrected, changed, or cured. Terminology used can perpetuate negative labels such as deviant, pathological, and defective, thus, best understood in medical terms. The history and future of disability are severely constricted, focusing solely on medical implications and can overlook social constructions contributing to the experience of disability. Alternatively, the social model presents disability less as an objective fact of the body and mind, and positions it in terms of social relations and barriers that an individual may face in social settings. 

The medical model of disability can influence the factors within the creation of medical or disability aides, such as creating aides reminiscent of hospital settings and institutions which can be traumatic to some who have spent and extended period of time there, or which solely reflect the function of hospital aides but not necessarily the function of an aide outside of these contexts. 

Among advocates of disability rights, who tend to subscribe to the social model instead, the medical model of disability is often cited as the basis of an unintended social of disabled people (otherwise known as ableism). Resources are seen as excessively misdirected towards an almost-exclusively medical focus when those same resources could potentially be used towards things like universal design and societal inclusionary practices. This includes the monetary and societal costs and benefits of various interventions, be they medical, surgical, social or occupational, from prosthetics, drug-based and other &quot;cures&quot;, and medical tests such as genetic screening or preimplantation genetic diagnosis. According to disability rights advocates, the medical model of disability is used to justify large investment in these procedures, technologies and research, when adaptation of the disabled person&#x27;s environment could potentially be more beneficial to the society at large, as well as financially cheaper and physically more attainable. 

Also, some disability rights groups see the medical model of disability as a civil rights issue and criticize charitable organizations or medical initiatives that use it in their portrayal of disabled people, because it promotes a pitiable, essentially negative, largely disempowered image of people with disabilities rather than casting disability as a political, social and environmental problem (see also the political slogan &quot;Piss On Pity&quot;).

<text>Hewitt Bostock, (May 31, 1864 – April 28, 1930) was a Canadian publisher, businessman and politician.

==Early life==
He was born in Walton Heath, Epsom, England and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge graduating with honours in mathematics. Bostock then studied law and was called to the bar in 1888. Rather than begin a legal practice he toured North America, Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan before settling in British Columbia in 1893. He purchased the Monte Creek Ranch (also known as the Ducks Ranch) in 1888, taking up residence there in 1894. In addition to the ranch, he also operated a lumber company.

==Career==
He founded the &quot;Province&quot; newspaper in 1894. He then entered politics winning election to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the 1896 election, representing the riding of Yale—Cariboo for one term (until the 1900 election).

In 1904, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by the prime minister, Wilfrid Laurier. A decade later he became Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate. Bostock broke with the Laurier Liberals over the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and became a Liberal-Unionist, campaigning in favour of the Union government of Sir Robert Borden during the 1917 election.

Following World War I, Bostock reconciled with the Liberals and, in 1921, became Minister of Public Works in the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King. Several months later, in 1922, he became Speaker of the Senate of Canada and held the position until his death in 1930. In 1925, he served as a member of the Canadian delegation to the Assembly of the League of Nations.

There is a Mount Hewitt Bostock (2183 m or 7162 ft) named in his honour in the northern end of the Canadian Cascades, about 20 kilometres northeast of the Fraser Canyon town of Boston Bar, which is in what had been the riding of Yale—Cariboo where his political career began (today in Chilliwack—Fraser Canyon).

His eldest daughter Marian Noel Sherman was a physician in India and a prominent humanist in western Canada.

<text>In cryptography, ICE (&quot;Information Concealment Engine&quot;) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by Matthew Kwan in 1997. The algorithm is similar in structure to DES, but with the addition of a key-dependent bit permutation in the round function. The key-dependent bit permutation is implemented efficiently in software. The ICE algorithm is not subject to patents, and the source code has been placed into the public domain.

ICE is a Feistel network with a block size of 64 bits. The standard ICE algorithm takes a 64-bit key and has 16 rounds. A fast variant, Thin-ICE, uses only 8 rounds. An open-ended variant, ICE-&quot;n&quot;, uses 16&quot;n&quot; rounds with 64&quot;n&quot; bit key. 

Van Rompay et al. (1998) attempted to apply differential cryptanalysis to ICE. They described an attack on Thin-ICE which recovers the secret key using 223 chosen plaintexts with a 25% success probability. If 227 chosen plaintexts are used, the probability can be improved to 95%. For the standard version of ICE, an attack on 15 out of 16 rounds was found, requiring 256 work and at most 256 chosen plaintexts.

==Structure==
ICE is a 16-round Feistel network. Each round uses a 32→32 bit F function, which uses 60 bits of key material.

The structure of the F function is somewhat similar to DES: The input is expanded by taking overlapping fields, the expanded input is XORed with a key, and the result is fed to a number of reducing S-boxes which undo the expansion.

First, ICE divides the input into 4 overlapping 10-bit values. They are bits 30, 31 and 0–7 of the input for the first 10-bit value and for the next values 6–15, 14–23, and 22–31.

Second is a keyed permutation, which is unique to ICE. Using a 20-bit permutation subkey, bits are swapped between halves of the 40-bit expanded input. (If subkey bit &quot;i&quot; is 1, then bits &quot;i&quot; and &quot;i&quot;+20 are swapped.)

Third, the 40-bit value is XORed with 40 more subkey bits.

Fourth, the value is fed through 4 10-bit S-boxes, each of which produces 8 bits of output. (These are much larger than DES&#x27;s 8 6→4 bit S-boxes.)

Fifth, the S-box output bits are permuted so that each S-box&#x27;s outputs are routed to each 4-bit field of 32-bit word, including 2 of the 8 &quot;overlap&quot; bits duplicated during the next round&#x27;s expansion.

Like DES, a software implementation would typically store the S-boxes pre-permuted, in 4 1024×32 bit lookup tables.

<text>This is a list of [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]]s in [[England]], ranked in descending order of capacity. There is an extremely large number of football stadiums and pitches in England, and a definitive list of stadiums would be difficult to produce. This list, therefore, is limited to stadiums that meet one of the following criteria based on current capacity:
* Used for football and have a capacity larger than 5,000 
* Used by one of the 92 clubs in the top four tiers of the English football league system as of the 2024–25 seasons in the (Premier League, EFL Championship, EFL League One, and EFL League Two).
* Used by one of the 12 clubs in the top tier of women&#x27;s football in England, the Women&#x27;s Super League, as of 2024–25.

A person who has watched a match at the stadiums of all 92 Premier League and English Football League (EFL) clubs in England and Wales may apply to join The 92 Club.

==Existing stadiums==


==Old stadiums==
Following crowd troubles in the 1980s, and regulations imposed after the Taylor Report, several English league stadiums have been built or completely redeveloped in the last few years. Prior to 1988, however, the last newly built Football League ground in England was Roots Hall, Southend, which was opened in 1955.

==Future stadiums and developments==

Stadiums which are currently being built, redeveloped, or have planning approval without work having commenced include:

<doc id="1188542" wikidata="Q5445267" url="?curid=1188542" title="Ferrari Lampredi engine">
<text>The Ferrari Lampredi engine was a naturally aspirated all aluminum 60° V12 engine produced between 1950 and 1959. Inline-4 and Inline-6 variants for racing were derived from it.

Aurelio Lampredi designed a number of racing engines for Ferrari. He was brought on to hedge the company&#x27;s bets with a different engine family than the small V12s designed by Gioacchino Colombo. Variants of his design powered the company to a string of world championships in the 1950s. All were quickly abandoned due to changing engine displacement sizes (because, starting in 1958, the sports regulations required sport cars to have engines within 3 litres), with the Dino V6 and V8 taking the place of the fours and sixes and evolution of the older Colombo V12 continuing as the company&#x27;s preeminent V12.

==V12==

===275===
After little luck in Formula One with the supercharged Colombo V12, Ferrari returned to natural aspiration. The task of creating the new V12 for Formula One use fell to Aurelio Lampredi, who designed a 3.3 L (3322 cc) unit, with bore centres at 108 mm apart, for 275 S and 275 F1. The SOHC, 2-valve engine debuted in 275 S, as a test bed, with three Weber 40DCF carburettors, developing and was soon upgraded with 42DCF Webers for for F1.

Applications:
* of (3322.35 cc)
** 1950 Ferrari 275 S
** 1950 Ferrari 275 F1

===340===
Being unable to match Alfetta 158 performance, Lampredi upgraded the design to 4.1 L (4101 cc) for 340 F1. Power output grew to but the single-seater was used in non-championship race only and very soon replaced by even bigger engined Ferrari. Like the Colombos, Lampredis engines found their way into road cars as well. The 1950 340 America and later 340 Mexico/MM were first with big 4.1 L (4101 cc) engines producing . All GT road cars used wet sumps, apart for dry-sumped 340 America having engine based directly on the 340 F1.

Applications:
* of (4101.67 cc)
** 1950 Ferrari 340 F1
** 1950 Ferrari 340 America
** 1951 Ferrari 342 America
** 1952 Ferrari 340 Mexico
** 1953 Ferrari 340 MM

===375===
In the same year as 340 F1, the last Lampredi-designed F1 engine was inaugurated. Now at 4.5 L (4493 cc) and installed in 375 F1, Ferrari was finally able to beat Alfa Romeo, in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. For the 1952 season Ferrari modified the 375 F1 for the Indianapolis 500 race. The bore was reduced by 1 mm (to 79 mm) for a total displacement below 4.4 L (4382 cc). New Weber 40IF4C carburettors improved power output to impressive . All Formula One &quot;Lampredi&quot; V12s used dry sump lubrication. This engine family remained the only Ferrari V12 never upgraded to a four-cam configuration. In 1953 &quot;Lampredi&quot; V12 powering customers 375 MM had displacement enlarged to 4.5 L (4522 cc) and power grew to . Its detuned version also powered the 375 America. Factory 375 MMs received different engines straight from Formula One, displacing 4493 cc.

Applications:
* of (4493.74 cc)
** 1950 Ferrari 375 F1 
** 1953 Ferrari 375 MM
* of (4382.1 cc)
** 1952 Ferrari 375 Indianapolis 
* of (4522 cc)
** 1953 Ferrari 375 MM
** 1953 Ferrari 375 America

===250===
Lampredi engines moved to the 250 with the 1953 250 Europa. Unlike the earlier engines with their oversquare 80 mm (3.1 in) by 68 mm (2.7 in) bore and stroke, the 250 used square (Bore 68 mm (2.7 in) X Stroke 68 mm (2.7 in)) dimensions for 3.0 L (2963 cc) total. Power output was at 6300 rpm.

Applications:
* of (2963.46 cc)
** 1953 250 Europa

===375 Plus &amp; 410===

The penultimate displacement evolution came in 1954 with 375 Plus. This almost 5 L (4954 cc) engine shared its stroke with 375 F1 powerplant at 74.5 mm and developed at 6000 rpm. This improvement helped score victories at Le Mans and Carrera Panamericana that year. Apart for later 375 Plus and 410 S, all early Sport V12s used wet sump lubrication. All Lampredi V12 engines had a stroke of 68 mm, except for 375 F1 and an enlarged 375 Plus engines.
The big America engine was made even larger for the 1955 410 Superamerica. Now with an 88 mm (3.5 in) bore and standard 68 mm stroke, it displaced 5 L (4962 cc) and produced depending on carburettors setup. The same engine powered the last &quot;Lampredi&quot; V12-engined sports racing car, the 410 S, with some upgraded to four coils and twin plugs per cylinder for a maximum output of .

Applications:
* of (4954.35 cc) 
** 1954 Ferrari 375 Plus 
* of (4962 cc)
** 1955 Ferrari 410 S 
** 1955 Ferrari 410 Superamerica

==I4==
Lampredi designed an inline-4 engine for Formula Two use. This was later adopted for Formula One and sports car racing cars through the 1950s. The original 2.0 L engine of 1951 would prove to be the longest-lived, continuing through 1957 in various cars. All &quot;Lampredi&quot; inline-4 engines used dry sump lubrication.

===500===
The initial engine was a 2.0 L (1,984.86 cc) unit with a bore and stroke. This engine was the second designed four-cylinder unit that Ferrari used in racing, appearing in 1951 in the Ferrari 500 F2 entrant in Formula Two. The aluminium engine produced with two Weber 45DOE carburettors, with power growing in 1953 to with two 50DCO carburettors. Its first outing was an Italian GP on 23 September 1951, won by Alberto Ascari.

An entirely different 2.0 L four-cylinder appeared in 1953 in the 553 F2. This time, bore was and stroke was (2.9 in) for a total of 1,997.12 cc. Two Weber 50DCOA3 carbs produced .

The original 1951 Formula Two, 2.0 L (1985 cc), engine was resurrected for the World Sportscar Championship in 1953 and the 500 Mondial. With lower compression and two Weber 45DCOA/3 carburettors, it produced . The same engine, now at , was used in the famous 500 TR. The &quot;red head&quot; cylinder head lent its name to the car, the first Testa Rossa. Another TR with this engine, the 1957 500 TRC, was produced to comply with new regulations from C-section of the International Sporting Code. This model was only raced by customers.
Applications:
* 496.215 cc per cylinder (1984.86 cc)
** 1951–1953 Ferrari 500 F2
** 1953 Ferrari 500 Mondial
** 1956 Ferrari 500 TR
** 1957 Ferrari 500 TRC
* 499.28 cc per cylinder (1997.12 cc)
** 1953 Ferrari 553 F2

===625===
Ferrari 625 F1 was the first Formula One Ferrari car with an inline-4 engine. 94 mm (3.7 in) by 90 mm (3.5 in) dimensions were selected, for a total displacement of 2.5 L (2498.32 cc). Output was . However, the car was not selected for competition at the start, with the lower cylinder capacity 500 F2 being chosen. The F1 was first tested on 2 September 1951 in Bari.

The 625 F1 car was reworked in late 1953 to become Ferrari&#x27;s 1954 entrant as 553 F1. The engine was bored and stroked to 100 mm (3.9 in) by 79.5 mm (3.1 in) for a similar 2,497.56 cc of displacement. The F1 car, with 12:1 to 13:1 compression and two Weber 50DCOA/3 carburettors, pumped from this powerplant. The oversquare engine reappeared again in the 1955 555 F1 with exactly the same specifications.

The first application of Lampredi&#x27;s four-cylinder engine outside Formula One and Formula Two was this same 2.5 L (2,498.32 cc) unit in the 1953 625 TF. The aluminium engine produced with 2 Weber 50DCO4 carburettors. Although marked as TF the car never raced in Targa Florio. After the Le Mans disaster, the 2.5 L I4 was resurrected for the 1956 625 LM car. With different carburettors setup, two Weber 42DCOA/3, output remained the same at 220 PS, which was enough for a third place at Le Mans.

Applications:
* 624.39 cc per cylinder (2497.56 cc)
** 1954 Ferrari 553 F1
** 1955 Ferrari 555 F1
* 624.58 cc per cylinder (2498.32 cc)
** 1951 Ferrari 625 F1
** 1953 Ferrari 625 TF
** 1956 Ferrari 625 LM
** 1957 Ferrari 625 TRC

===735===
A big-bore version was also produced and implemented in 1953 735 S. Displacement was now 2.9 L (2941.66 cc) with 102 mm (4 in) of bore, though the 90 mm (3.5 in) stroke was retained. Output nudged up to with two Weber 50DCOA carburettors.

Applications:
* 735.41 cc per cylinder (2941.66 cc)
** 1953 735 S

===750===
For the 1954 the bore of the Lampredi I4 was nudged up to 103 mm (4.1 in) for the 3.0 L (2999.62 cc) unit used in the 750 Monza. Engine was a development of a Type 555 I4. Dual Weber 58DCOA/3 carburettors pushed out .

Applications:
* 749.9 cc per cylinder (2999.62 cc)
** 1954 750 Monza

===857 &amp; 860===
For 1955, the &quot;Type 129&quot; engine debuted in the 857 S. Bore was the same 102 mm (4.0 in) as the Type 735, but stroke was now for a total of 3.4 L (3432 cc). At the 1955 Targa Florio, the 857 S came third overall, driven by Eugenio Castellotti. Same engine type as in 857 S, was later used in the 1956 860 Monza with two Weber 58DCOA/3 carburettors and . These cars placed first and second at Sebring and came second and third at Mille Miglia that year.

Applications:
* 858 cc per cylinder (3432 cc)
** 1955 Ferrari 857 S
** 1956 Ferrari 860 Monza

==I6==
===306 S===
In 1954 Ferrari produced its first inline-6 engine. Aurelio Lampredi designed a prototype &quot;Tipo 114&quot; engine for the experimental 306 S sports car that never raced. The internal measurements were identical to the 500 Mondial engine.

Applications:
* 496.215 cc per cylinder (2977.28 cc)

===376 S===
A bigger &quot;Tipo 118&quot; version was installed in the short-lived 376 S sports car (also known as 118 LM) converted from 306 S chassis in 1955. It used the same bore and stroke and as the original &quot;Lampredi&quot; 625 F1 inline-4 engine, it was extrapolated from, and produced at 6200 rpm with three Weber 58DCOA/3 carburettors.

Applications:
* 624.58 cc per cylinder (3747.48 cc)
** 1955 376 S

===735 LM===

Later same year 735 LM (also known as 121 LM or 446 S) was created, intended for 1955 Le Mans, this time named from its unitary displacement, the same as on the 735 S engine from which its dimensions were drawn. Lampredi modified the bore of the 376 S with for the 735 LM &quot;Tipo 121&quot; engine. Displacement was . Triple Weber 50DCOA/3 carburettors pushed power up to at 5800 rpm. With this power, the 735 LM could hit on the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans. Both engines used dry sump lubrication.

Applications:
* 735.41 cc per cylinder (4412.5 cc)
** 1955 735 LM

==I2 prototype==

Enzo Ferrari and Aurelio Lampredi were interested in creating extremely reliable engines for racing use. In 1955, after seeing the success of Lampredi&#x27;s Inline-4 engines, the pair considered an Inline-two engine for the slowest, twisty racing courses. Lampredi built a prototype &quot;tipo 116&quot; with 4 valves per cylinder and 2.5 L (2493 cc) of displacement. Bore and stroke were unusual . Project was codenamed &quot;252 F1&quot;, as per naming convention. The engine produced at 4800 rpm on the test bench, but broke the crankshaft due to poor balance. The project was abandoned shortly after in favor of more-conventional I4 engines.

<text>Marais-Vernier () is a commune in the Eure department in Normandy in northern France. It is situated near the left bank of the Seine, at the edge of a wetland (the &quot;Marais Vernier&quot;) formed by an old branch of the Seine. The wetland was cut off from the river with dams in the 17th century. Part of it is used for farming (cattle, Camargue horses, Scottish Highland Cattle), part is a protected area which is important for birds like storks. The village itself is situated on the edge of the wetland.

<text>Edward Henry Heinemann (March 14, 1908 – November 26, 1991) was a military aircraft designer for the Douglas Aircraft Company.

==Biography==
Heinemann was born in Saginaw, Michigan. He moved to California as a boy and was raised in Los Angeles. A self-taught engineer, he joined Douglas Aircraft as a draftsman in 1926, but was laid off within a year. After stints at International Aircraft, Moreland Aircraft, and the first Northrop Corporation, Heinemann rejoined Douglas after it acquired Northrop. Heinemann became Douglas&#x27; Chief Engineer in 1936. He remained with the company through 1960, when he left to join Guidance Technology. In 1962 he joined General Dynamics as Corporate Vice President of Engineering. In this position he oversaw the development of the F-16. He retired in 1973.

The airplane designer Burt Rutan listed Heinemann as among the leading pioneers in aviation who had inspired him to become an aerospace engineer.

His approach to aircraft design was uncomplicated, once saying that he simply took the most powerful engine available and designed the aircraft around it.

==Designs==
During his long career at Douglas, Heinemann designed more than 20 combat aircraft, primarily for the U.S. Navy, including many that became legends in aviation history. His designs included the following aircraft:

* SBD Dauntless dive bomber
* A-20 Havoc light bomber/attack aircraft
* A-26 Invader light bomber/attack aircraft
* A-1 Skyraider attack aircraft
* A-3 Skywarrior bomber
* A-4 Skyhawk light bomber
* F3D Skyknight night fighter
* F4D Skyray carrier-based fighter aircraft
* Douglas Skystreak and Douglas Skyrocket research aircraft

One of the first aircraft to be designed by Heinemann was the Moreland M-1 Trainer of 1929, a braced-wing parasol wing monoplane. Due to the 1929 recession only a small number were sold before the company ceased trading in 1933.

==Awards and medals==
* 1953: Collier Trophy (for the F4D Skyray)
* 1978: Guggenheim Medal
* 1981: National Aviation Hall of Fame 
*1982: International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame
* 1983: National Medal of Science

The Naval Air Systems Command awards the Edward H. Heinemann Award annually to an individual or group that makes a significant contribution to aircraft design.

<doc id="1188556" wikidata="Q5077186" url="?curid=1188556" title="Charles E. Sorensen">
<text>Charles Emil Sorensen (7 September 1881 – 11 August 1968) was a Danish-American principal of the Ford Motor Company during its first four decades. Like most other managers at Ford at the time, he did not have an official job title, but he served functionally as a patternmaker, foundry engineer, mechanical engineer, industrial engineer, production manager, and executive in charge of all production.

By the end of his career, he had become an officer of the company: a vice president and a director. Speaking figuratively, he saw himself during most of his career as &quot;a viceroy ruling the production province of the Ford empire,&quot; and at the end as a &quot;regent,&quot; who managed the company during the &quot;interregnum&quot; between the reigns of Henry Ford I and Henry Ford II.

==Early life==

Sorensen emigrated from Denmark to the United States with his parents when he was 4. He first worked as a surveyor&#x27;s assistant and then apprenticed at the Jewett Stove Works in Buffalo, New York as a patternmaker and foundryman.

==Early career==
In 1900, the family moved to Detroit, and while working at a foundry in Detroit, he met Henry Ford. In 1905, he accepted a job as a patternmaker at Ford Motor Company. By 1907, he was head of the pattern department. He translated Ford&#x27;s ideas, which came to him in the form of simple sketches or descriptions, into prototypes and into the patterns from which the parts would be cast.

Sorensen (with others, notably Walter Flanders, Clarence Avery, and Ed Martin) is credited with developing the first automotive assembly line, having formulated the idea of moving a product (for cars, that would be in the form of the chassis) through multiple workstations. His innovations were widely applied to the mass production of complex products, which average people could afford.

One Sunday in 1910, at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant, Sorensen asserted that he and another Ford executive, Charles Lewis, tested his idea. Apparently, by the end of the day, he had determined that moving a car in a straight line from one end of the factory to the other, with parts added along the way by specialized workers performing repetitive tasks, with the stockrooms also placed strategically along the line, was the most efficient and therefore the cheapest way to build an automobile. To prove his theory, he then towed an automobile chassis on a rope over his shoulders through the Ford plant while others added the parts.

==Later life==

Sorensen was a major contributor to the launch of the Highland Park Ford Plant in 1910, where he was second in command to production chief Peter (Ed) Martin. He then helped with the development of the Fordson tractor and modernization of Edsel Ford&#x27;s Lincoln when it was purchased by Ford from Henry M. Leland in 1922. Following transfer of auto assembly to the Rouge in the late 1920s, he was a &quot;key leader&quot; in manufacturing as number two man to Ed Martin, who was made vice president of manufacturing in 1924. He was manager of production planning and development. &quot;Ed Martin, who was plant superintendent, and I practically lived at the Rouge.&quot; It has been said he considered himself the &quot;Head of Production,&quot; and Henry Ford&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man,&quot; but he was only one of at least six company leaders claiming that distinction. (Ford&#x27;s practice of telling his men to &quot;[j]ust go out there and run the plant […] [a]nd don&#x27;t worry about titles&quot; contributed to these variations in viewpoints.)

Sorensen&#x27;s help in innovating foundry practice for mass production earned for him from Henry Ford the nickname of &quot;Cast-Iron Charlie&quot; during the company&#x27;s first decade, when he invented (or at least independently reinvented) the use of metal patterns, instead of wood ones, to withstand the huge number of moldmaking cycles needed for mass production and methods of core registration to position the cores accurately without relying on the sand under them to assist in the registration. In 1928 Sorensen joined Henry and Edsel Ford as the three US directors out of seven on the board of Ford&#x27;s new reorganized independent European operations. During the 1930s, Sorensen was also responsible for production techniques allowing the manufacture of a sophisticated V-8 engine block from a single casting, and using a more automated foundry workflow than ever before. The resulting Ford Flathead engine continued in production until 1953; a derivative design was used in French military vehicles into the 1990s.

During the early 1940s, Sorensen had responsibility for Ford&#x27;s defense contracts, including Ford&#x27;s Jeep and aircraft engines and production of the B-24 Liberator bomber. He led the design of the Willow Run plant, where the B-24s were made, applying all of his previous experience in the development and refinement of mass production methods. Each was made up of 488,193 parts, and they were turned out at a still astonishing rate of one per hour; the previous production rate was one per day. He was knighted by the king of Denmark and made a member of the Order of the Dannebrog for his accomplishments.

During his career, he was noted for his brilliance in organization and his hard-driving personality, and also for insensitivity to others and an explosive temper. Sorensen&#x27;s memoirs intended to show how the Ford industrial empire was kept intact and his hard struggle to bring Henry Ford II to the direction of its destinies. After leaving the navy, a 24-year-old Henry Ford II joined company management as a vice-president on December 15, 1943. Sorensen, who had mentored the young Ford, was not offered a major role by him. He requested retirement in December 1943, to be effective January 1, 1944, as previously agreed with the elder Ford in 1941. His retirement was effective on March 13, 1944. He then accepted a position as president of automaker Willys-Overland, presiding over the transition from wartime production back to civilian-market production. Sorensen effectively retired after clashes with the board but retained a title and salary as vice-chairman from 1946 until full retirement in 1950. Willys became Kaiser Jeep and was later acquired by American Motors Corporation (AMC). AMC was later bought out by Chrysler.

Sorensen retired in Florida and US Virgin Islands. He had extensive land holdings in Cuba (which were seized by the new government after the Cuban revolution). He died on August 28, 1968, at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. He is buried in Miami Beach, Florida. He was preceded in death by his first wife Helen (née Mitchell) Sorensen and son Clifford Sorensen.

<text>The Union of the Peoples of Cameroon ( - UPC) is a political party in Cameroon. It was one of the main belligerents in the Cameroon War.

==Foundation==
The UPC was founded on 10 April 1948, at a meeting in the bar &quot;Chez Sierra&quot; in Bassa. Twelve men assisted the founding meeting, including Charles Assalé, Léonard Bouli, and Guillaume Bagal. The majority of the participants were trade unionists. In many ways UPC was a continuation of the Cameroonian Rally (RACAM). On 11 April 1948, a Provisional Bureau was established. Bouli was elected general secretary, Bagal joint general secretary, Emmanuel Yap the treasurer and J-R Biboum the joint treasurer. The following day the statutes of UPC were deposited at the Mayor&#x27;s office in Douala at 10.50 am. The group was, however, not legally registered. On 13 April, UPC issued its first public declaration of intent, the &quot;Appeal to the Cameroonians&quot;.

On 6 May, another meeting was held, this time at the residence of Guillaume Bagal in Douala. The statutes and the &quot;Appeal to the Cameroonians&quot; were revised. A new Provisional Bureau was constituted made up of General Secretary: Étienne Libaï; Joint General Secretary: Léonard Bouli; Joint Secretary: Guillaume Bagal; General Treasurer: Emmanuel Yap; Joint Treasurer: Jacques Biboum; Members: Nkoudou Raphaël, Owona Ernest-Marie. On 14 May, the revised statues were handed over to the Mayor&#x27;s office in Douala. On 9 June the authorities allowed the registration of UPC, following pressure from the African Democratic Rally (RDA) and the French Communist Party (PCF).

On 17 June, the Provisional Bureau decided the UPC would call itself the &quot;Cameroonian section of RDA&quot;, and that the first public function of UPC would be held on 22 June in Douala. The meeting of 22 June was held in the &quot;Salles de Fêtes d&#x27;Akwa&quot; and was attended by around 500 people. Libaï and Bouli addressed the function. Participatants included Ruben Um Nyobé, Charles Assalé, as well as traditional chiefs such as Ekwalla Essakra and Lobé-Bell. In November, Ruben Um Nyobé took charge of the organization as its general secretary after a vote at a meeting of the Provisional Bureau. Before the meeting of the enlarged Provisional Bureau, Léopold Moumé-Etia had been mentioned as another possible candidate for the position, but he declined the nomination on personal grounds. At the second congress of RDA, celebrated in Treichville, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, 1–5 January 1949, membership of the UPC in the RDA was confirmed, and Um Nyobé was elected vice-president of RDA.

Despite his friendly relationship with the PCF, the historian Thomas Deltombe points out that the organization is not a communist party and that it &quot;was above all a fraternity by default. Who else but the communists, in the 1950s, were ready to take a stand for the liberation of the colonized peoples? UPC activists could identify themselves, as individuals, with communist sympathies, but the UPC, as a nationalist movement, was not. &quot;While some of its leaders such as Félix Moumié or Ernest Ouandié are indeed sensitive to communist ideals, others, notably Ruben Um Nyobe, consider that the UPC must remain neutral on ideological issues to bring together all Cameroonian independence activists.

==Growth==
On 10 April 1950, the enlarged Leading Committee holds a meeting in Dschang. During the course of the meeting a decision is taken to regard the function as the first congress of UPC. The congress lasted until 13 April. A new Leading Committee was elected with President: Chief Mathias Djiomessi; General Secretary: Ruben Um Nyobé; Vice-presidents: Guillaume Bagal, Phillipe Essama Essi, Félix Moumié, Samuel Noumouwe and Treasurer: Emmanuel Yap. After the congress Charles Assalé left the movement and joined the procolonial fold. The party published the papers &quot;La Voix du Cameroun&quot;, &quot;Lumière&quot;, &quot;Étoile&quot; and &quot;Vérité&quot;.

After trying a parliamentary vote in 1952 without success, the UPC turned to the United Nations, who had the guardianship of Cameroon, to demand independence and reunification. Under the aegis of Ruben Um Nyobé, the Secretary-General, the party requested of the 4th UN General Assembly supervising committee in December 1952:
*Revision of the trusteeship agreements of 13 December 1946 that were signed without any prior consultation of the people contrary to what was claimed by Louis-Paul Aujoulat and Alexandre Douala Manga Bell, who said &#x27;... the trusteeship agreement was subject to widespread distribution, and a very broad debate in Cameroon, it has been approved by the Cameroonian people ...&quot;
*Immediate reunification
*Setting of a date (10 years) to end the trusteeship agreements and provide access to the political independence of Cameroon.
Ruben Um Nyobé proposed that for about ten years before independence there should be a program that would give Cameroons adequate training to assume responsibility for the state arising from independence.

From 1953, in the face of increased repression by the colonial power, the UPC followed the urging of Dr. Félix-Roland Moumié to move into radical political action. According to historian Bernard Droz, China provided weapons to the UPC. Seven years after its founding, in 1955 the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon controlled 460 village or neighborhood committees and 80,000 members, particularly on the coast in central, south and west Cameroon, among the Bamileke and Bassa.

Representatives of the party were invited in 1958 to the &quot;Conference of Independent African States&quot; organized by Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah.

===Youth and women&#x27;s structures===

In 1952, the party created a women&#x27;s branch, the Democratic Union of Cameroonian Women. While the latter is not defined as &quot;feminist&quot;, it nevertheless contributes to destabilizing the places generally assigned to women by colonial authorities or traditional leaders, for example by calling for the abolition of laws prohibiting women from taking up certain professions or commercial activities. Its activists send multiple petitions to the United Nations and organize demonstrations challenging the administration.

The Cameroonian Democratic Youth was founded in 1954 and became an important lever for recruiting young activists. It is increasing its contacts with other youth organisations, particularly in Eastern European countries, and participates in conferences abroad. Its leader Hyacinthe Mpaye, who was involved in the French army during the Second World War and a CGT trade unionist, was close to Marxism: he explained what he thought was a necessary alliance between Cameroonians and the French working class. The JDC has a strong autonomy from the UPC.

On the other hand, the UPC considers economic claims to be inseparable from political claims:&quot; the employers are supported by the administration and this administration can only pursue a policy of national oppression in our countries by using economic weapons and material means held in large part by private companies. The UPC considers, and trade union activists agree, that the economic emancipation of our people is impossible without the political achievements necessary for the economic, social and cultural progress of the people.

==Movement in exile==

In 1954, the new French High Commissioner Roland Pré was determined to liquidate the UPC. The party leaders are gathered in Douala to facilitate their surveillance and carry out judicial harassment against them. Abel Kingué, the vice-president, is thus prosecuted for &quot;contempt of court&quot; for a case dating back to 1951; Pierre Penda, a member of the steering committee, is the subject of five consecutive cases; Félix Moumié is prosecuted for &quot;defamation and insult&quot;; and Ruben Um Nyobè is convicted of &quot;libelous denunciation&quot;. Roland Pré is currently conducting a purge within the judicial system, sending back to France magistrates deemed &quot;too soft&quot; in their repression of the UPC. Cameroonian law enforcement agencies and organizations close to the administration (including the Rassemblement des populations du Cameroun) are mobilized to prevent UPC public meetings and speeches. The control of private correspondence is becoming systematic, while activists&#x27; homes are frequently searched.

After the first revolt in May 1955, suppressed by the French colonial authority at the time, the party was dissolved by a decree dated 13 July 1955, and its leaders were forced to go into exile in Kumba in the British Southern Cameroons, then in Cairo, Conakry, Accra and Beijing. 
On 28 January 1956 the UPC presented its position in a declaration to the international press signed by Félix-Roland Moumié (President), Ruben Um Nyobé (Secretary General) and the two Vice-Presidents, Ernest Ouandié and Abel Kingué. They called for reunification of French- and British-administered areas as an independent state.

Ruben Um Nyobé was killed in the bush on 13 September 1958. Felix Moumié would be poisoned in Geneva in October 1960, by the French secret service. The UPC continued its armed struggle until the arrest in August 1970 of Ernest Ouandié, who was shot six months later on 15 January 1971. Meanwhile, another leader of UPC, Osendé Afana, was killed in the south-east on 15 March 1966.

==Revival==
After a long period of hiding, the UPC officially re-surfaced in 1991 with the return to multiparty politics in Cameroon. The party held Congresses more or less unitary in 1991, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2004 and 2007. In 1997 the UPC presented an official candidate for president, Professor Henri Hogbe Nlend. He came second behind the incumbent President Paul Biya. Another attempt to nominate a member of UPC was made in 2004 with Dr. Samuel Mack Kit, but this nomination was rejected by the Supreme Court, ostensibly due to an incomplete application. The UPC has been elected to parliament and ministers to the government of Cameroon until 2007.

<doc id="1188561" wikidata="Q3550257" url="?curid=1188561" title="Cameroon Democratic Union">
<text>The Cameroon Democratic Union () is a political party in Cameroon. It was founded by Adamou Ndam Njoya, a former Minister of National Education under President Ahmadou Ahidjo, on 26 April 1991.

The CDU boycotted the March 1992 parliamentary election, along with the Social Democratic Front (SDF) due to the government&#x27;s failure to meet opposition demands, which included the establishment of an independent electoral commission to oversee the election. In the May 1997 parliamentary election, the UDC won five seats, all of them in Noun Department in the West Province. It then boycotted the October 1997 presidential election, along with the Social Democratic Front (SDF) and the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP).

In the parliamentary election held on 30 June and 15 September 2002, the UDC won five seats, all in Noun Department, out of 180 seats nationwide. Adamou Ndam Njoya and John Fru Ndi failed to agree on the designation of an all-opposition single candidate for the presidential election of October 11, 2004. As a result, Ndam Njoya represented a coalition of political parties, the Coalition for National Reconciliation and Reconstruction, and placed third in the final ballot count, winning 4.47% (168,318 votes).

Njoya was re-elected for another five-year term as CDU Chairman at a party congress in Yaoundé, attended by about 3,000 delegates, on 30 November–2 December 2006; there was no challenger for the position.

The UDC won four out of the 163 initially declared seats in the July 2007 parliamentary election; it won all four of these seats in the Noun Centre constituency, where the party received 58.28% of the vote. The UDC did not gain any seats in the partial election, held in September, for 17 seats where the initial results were annulled.

At the time of the 2007 election, the CDU formed an alliance with the Progressive Movement (MP) of Jean-Jacques Ekindi, agreeing not to run candidates in the Wouri Centre constituency, where the MP was competing.

<doc id="1188562" wikidata="Q6869576" url="?curid=1188562" title="Mint chocolate chip">
<text>Mint chocolate chip is an ice cream flavor composed of mint ice cream with small chocolate chips. In some cases the liqueur crème de menthe is used to provide the mint flavor, but in most cases peppermint or spearmint flavoring is used. Food coloring is usually added to make it green, but it may be beige or white in &quot;all natural&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; varieties.

According to the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), 3% of all ice cream sold in 2000 was mint chocolate chip, making it the 10th-most popular flavor of ice cream. In a July 2017 survey by IDFA, mint chocolate chip was ranked as America&#x27;s 4th most popular ice cream flavor.

Mint chocolate chip is an acquired taste that people either love or hate. In Korea, &quot;mint chocolate chip&quot; is incredibly popular, often referred to simply as &quot;mint choco,&quot; and is considered a widespread food trend with many variations including dedicated &quot;mint chocolate&quot; snacks, drinks, and even fried chicken flavored with mint chocolate.

Because of its popularity, the flavor is used in other foods such as cookies and meringues. Ice cream manufacturer Baskin-Robbins has created a hard candy named &quot;mint chocolate chip&quot; that tastes similar to their ice cream of the same name (which is one of their &quot;permanent flavors&quot;).

Some brands name it chocolate (or choco) chip mint, mint &#x27;n chip, or just mint chip.
==History==
Baskin Robbins cites Mint Chocolate Chip as being one of the original 31 flavors when they began operations in 1945. 
Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants were serving the flavor by the early 1950s, which would become a common flavor into the 1960s and 70s. Previously, Howard Johnson&#x27;s was responsible for inventing chocolate chip ice cream under George R. Pitman.

The domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh&#x27;s last meal before he was executed for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing was two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream in the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana.

<doc id="1188566" wikidata="Q3046267" url="?curid=1188566" title="Enhanced Variable Rate Codec">
<text>Enhanced Variable Rate CODEC (EVRC) is a speech codec used in CDMA networks. It was developed in 1995 to replace the QCELP vocoder which used more bandwidth on the carrier&#x27;s network, thus EVRC&#x27;s primary goal was to offer the mobile carriers more capacity on their networks while not increasing the amount of bandwidth or wireless spectrum needed. EVRC uses RCELP technology.

EVRC compresses each 20 milliseconds of 8000 Hz, 16-bit sampled speech input into output frames of one of three different sizes: full rate – 171 bits (8.55 kbit/s), half rate – 80 bits (4.0 kbit/s), eighth rate – 16 bits (0.8 kbit/s). A quarter rate was not included in the original EVRC specification and eventually became part of EVRC-B. 

EVRC was replaced by SMV. Recently, however, SMV itself has been replaced by the new CDMA2000 4GV codecs. 4GV is the next generation 3GPP2 standards-based EVRC-B codec. 4GV is designed to allow service providers to dynamically prioritize voice capacity on their network as required.

EVRC can be also used in 3GPP2 container file format - 3G2.

<text>The American Deserters Committee (ADC) of Montreal, Quebec, Canada was a group of American Armed Forces members who deserted their posts and went to Canada to avoid the Vietnam War. The deserters were aided in their efforts by groups such as Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, the Revolutionary Union, The Resistance, American Friends Service Committee, War Resisters League and the Committee for Peace and Freedom.

ADC was formed by a group of politically active deserters, including Jerry Borstein and Bill Hertzog in December 1968, modeled on existing Deserters&#x27; Committees in Paris and Stockholm. ADC members included both deserters and their spouses and girlfriends, and welcomed other expatriate Americans who shared their views. Though ADC retained almost total ideological independence, it received the bulk of its funds from the Montreal Council to Aid War Resisters (MCAWR), which, in turn, received most of its funds from the Canadian Council of Churches.

ADC operated a hostel for newly arrived deserters (sometimes housing up to 20 men at a time), and published a newsletter called ADC Times. By the early summer of 1970, friction within ADC began to emerge over the group&#x27;s inner circle of founders and colleagues, who had begun calling themselves the &quot;Central Committee.&quot; The Committee was seen by many as increasingly autocratic and undemocratic, adopting a radical, Marxist agenda, and discouraging dissent. In addition, it had allied itself with Quebec&#x27;s separatist Front de Liberation Populaire (FLP), a nonviolent and implicitly Marxist organization, which campaigned for an independent and ideologically progressive Quebec. Though most ADC members were at least sympathetic to the FLP agenda, many feared that allying ADC (which had a few dozen members) with FLP (which had thousands of active supporters) benefitted neither group, while tarnishing the images of both.

In 1971, the ADC merged with the MCAWR, forming the American Refugee Service.

<text>Charles Leonard Levin (April 28, 1926 – November 19, 2020) was an American judge. He served as a Michigan Court of Appeals judge from 1966 to 1972 and as a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 1973 to 1996.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Detroit, Michigan. He attended the University of Michigan where he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1946 and his Bachelor of Laws in 1947 from the University of Michigan Law School. He is a member of the Levin political and legal family of Michigan.

When he decided to run for the Michigan Supreme Court, Levin did not feel comfortable running as either a Democratic or Republican nominee. He then formed his own party and nominated himself. He was elected to two additional terms as an independent candidate. During his tenure on the bench, he gained the respect of many colleagues, prompting U.S. District Court Judge Avern Cohn to note, &quot;Justice Levin has displayed scholarship, pragmatism, insight, honesty, courage, and humanity.&quot;

Levin&#x27;s father, Theodore Levin, was a federal district court judge. His brother, Joseph Levin, ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1974. His sister Mimi Levin Lieber served on the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York; her son and Charles&#x27;s nephew Janno Lieber has been Chairman and CEO of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority since 2022. Levin&#x27;s cousin Carl Levin was a U.S. senator for Michigan from 1979 to 2015. His cousin Sander Levin was the U.S. congressman for Michigan&#x27;s 9th congressional district from 1983 to 2019. Since 2019, his cousin Andy Levin serves as the U.S. congressman for Michigan&#x27;s 9th congressional district.

In 1999, Levin was remarried to a former law clerk, Helene White, who has been a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit since 2008. The couple divorced in November 2006.

Levin died on November 19, 2020, in Detroit at the age of 94.

<doc id="1188574" wikidata="Q18696" url="?curid=1188574" title="Motor cortex">
<text>The motor cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements.
The motor cortex is an area of the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus.

==Components==
The motor cortex can be divided into three areas:

1. The primary motor cortex is the main contributor to generating neural impulses that pass down to the spinal cord and control the execution of movement. However, some of the other motor areas in the brain also play a role in this function. It is located on the anterior paracentral lobule on the medial surface.

2. The premotor cortex is responsible for some aspects of motor control, possibly including the preparation for movement, the sensory guidance of movement, the spatial guidance of reaching, or the direct control of some movements with an emphasis on control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body. Located anterior to the primary motor cortex.

3. The supplementary motor area (or SMA), has many proposed functions including the internally generated planning of movement, the planning of sequences of movement, and the coordination of the two sides of the body such as in bi-manual coordination. Located on the midline surface of the hemisphere anterior to the primary motor cortex.
* The posterior parietal cortex is sometimes also considered to be part of the group of motor cortical areas; however it is best to regard it as an association cortex rather than motor. It is thought to be responsible for transforming multisensory information into motor commands, and to be responsible for some aspects of motor planning, in addition to many other functions that may not be motor related.
* The primary somatosensory cortex, especially the part called area 3a, which lies directly against the motor cortex, is sometimes considered to be functionally part of the motor control circuitry.

Other brain regions outside the cerebral cortex are also of great importance to motor function, most notably the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, pedunculopontine nucleus and the red nucleus, as well as other subcortical motor nuclei.

===The premotor cortex===
In the earliest work on the motor cortex, researchers recognized only one cortical field involved in motor control. Alfred Walter Campbell was the first to suggest that there might be two fields, a &quot;primary&quot; motor cortex and an &quot;intermediate precentral&quot; motor cortex. His reasons were largely based on cytoarchitectonics, or the study of the appearance of the cortex under a microscope. The primary motor cortex contains cells with giant cell bodies known as &quot;Betz cells&quot;. These cells were mistakenly thought to be the main outputs from the cortex, sending fibers to the spinal cord. It has since been found that Betz cells account for about 2-3% of the projections from the cortex to the spinal cord, or about 10% of the projections from the primary motor cortex to the spinal cord. The specific function of the Betz cells that distinguishes them from other output cells of the motor cortex remains unknown, but they continue to be used as a marker for the primary motor cortex.

Other researchers, such as Oskar Vogt, Cécile Vogt-Mugnier and Otfrid Foerster also suggested that motor cortex was divided into a primary motor cortex (area 4, according to Brodmann&#x27;s naming scheme) and a higher-order motor cortex (area 6 according to Korbinian Brodmann).

Wilder Penfield notably disagreed and suggested that there was no functional distinction between area 4 and area 6. In his view both were part of the same map, though area 6 tended to emphasize the muscles of the back and neck. Woolsey who studied the motor map in monkeys also believed there was no distinction between primary motor and premotor. M1 was the name for the proposed single map that encompassed both the primary motor cortex and the premotor cortex. Although sometimes &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;primary motor cortex&quot; are used interchangeably, strictly speaking, they derive from different conceptions of motor cortex organization.

Despite the views of Penfield and Woolsey, a consensus emerged that area 4 and area 6 had sufficiently different functions that they could be considered different cortical fields. Fulton helped to solidify this distinction between a primary motor cortex in area 4 and a premotor cortex in area 6. As Fulton pointed out, and as all subsequent research has confirmed, both primary motor and premotor cortex project directly to the spinal cord and are capable of some direct control of movement. Fulton showed that when the primary motor cortex is damaged in an experimental animal, movement soon recovers; when the premotor cortex is damaged, movement soon recovers; when both are damaged, movement is lost and the animal cannot recover.

The premotor cortex is now generally divided into four sections. First it is divided into an upper (or dorsal) premotor cortex and a lower (or ventral) premotor cortex. Each of these is further divided into a region more toward the front of the brain (rostral premotor cortex) and a region more toward the back (caudal premotor cortex). A set of acronyms are commonly used: PMDr (premotor dorsal, rostral), PMDc, PMVr, PMVc. Some researchers use a different terminology. Field 7 or F7 denotes PMDr; F2 = PMDc; F5=PMVr; F4=PMVc.

PMDc is often studied with respect to its role in guiding reaching. Neurons in PMDc are active during reaching. When monkeys are trained to reach from a central location to a set of target locations, neurons in PMDc are active during the preparation for the reach and also during the reach itself. They are broadly tuned, responding best to one direction of reach and less well to different directions. Electrical stimulation of the PMDc on a behavioral time scale was reported to evoke a complex movement of the shoulder, arm, and hand that resembles reaching with the hand opened in preparation to grasp.

PMDr may participate in learning to associate arbitrary sensory stimuli with specific movements or learning arbitrary response rules. In this sense it may resemble the prefrontal cortex more than other motor cortex fields. It may also have some relation to eye movement. Electrical stimulation in the PMDr can evoke eye movements and neuronal activity in the PMDr can be modulated by eye movement.

PMVc or F4 is often studied with respect to its role in the sensory guidance of movement. Neurons here are responsive to tactile stimuli, visual stimuli, and auditory stimuli. These neurons are especially sensitive to objects in the space immediately surrounding the body, in so-called peripersonal space. Electrical stimulation of these neurons causes an apparent defensive movement as if protecting the body surface. This premotor region may be part of a larger circuit for maintaining a margin of safety around the body and guiding movement with respect to nearby objects.

PMVr or F5 is often studied with respect to its role in shaping the hand during grasping and in interactions between the hand and the mouth. Electrical stimulation of at least some parts of F5, when the stimulation is applied on a behavioral time scale, evokes a complex movement in which the hand moves to the mouth, closes in a grip, orients such that the grip faces the mouth, the neck turns to align the mouth to the hand, and the mouth opens.

Mirror neurons were first discovered in area F5 in the monkey brain by Rizzolatti and colleagues. These neurons are active when the monkey grasps an object. Yet the same neurons become active when the monkey watches an experimenter grasp an object in the same way. The neurons are therefore both sensory and motor. Mirror neurons are proposed to be a basis for understanding the actions of others by internally imitating the actions using one&#x27;s own motor control circuits.

===The supplementary motor cortex===
Penfield described a cortical motor area, the supplementary motor area (SMA), on the top or dorsal part of the cortex. Each neuron in the SMA may influence many muscles, many body parts, and both sides of the body. The map of the body in SMA is therefore extensively overlapping. SMA projects directly to the spinal cord and may play some direct role in the control of movement.

Based on early work using brain imaging techniques in the human brain, Roland suggested that the SMA was especially active during the internally generated plan to make a sequence of movements. In the monkey brain, neurons in the SMA are active in association with specific learned sequences of movement.

Others have suggested that, because the SMA appears to control movement bilaterally, it may play a role in inter-manual coordination.

Yet others have suggested that, because of the direct projection of SMA to the spinal cord and because of its activity during simple movements, it may play a direct role in motor control rather than solely a high level role in planning sequences.

On the basis of the movements evoked during electrical stimulation, it has been suggested that the SMA may have evolved in primates as a specialist in the part of the motor repertoire involving climbing and other complex locomotion.

Based on the pattern of projections to the spinal cord, it has been suggested that another set of motor areas may lie next to the supplementary motor area, on the medial (or midline) wall of the hemisphere. These medial areas are termed the cingulate motor areas. Their functions are not yet understood.

==History==
In 1870, Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch demonstrated that electrical stimulation of certain parts of the dog brain resulted in muscular contraction on the opposite side of the body. This confirmed experimentally the existence of a cortical motor center, which was inferred by Jackson a few years earlier on the basis of clinical observations. Together with Broca&#x27;s (1861) discovery of a language center in the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex, the demonstration of a cortical motor center put an end to Flourens&#x27; doctrine (1842) that function was widely distributed across the cerebral cortex (i.e., not localized).

A little later, in 1874, David Ferrier, working in the laboratory of the West Riding Lunatic Asylum at Wakefield (at the invitation of its director, James Crichton-Browne), mapped the motor cortex in the monkey brain using electrical stimulation. He found that the motor cortex contained a rough map of the body with the feet at the top (or dorsal part) of the brain and the face at the bottom (or ventral part) of the brain. He also found that when electrical stimulation was maintained for a longer time, such as for a second, instead of being discharged over a fraction of a second, then some coordinated, seemingly meaningful movements could be caused, instead of only muscle twitches.

After Ferrier&#x27;s discovery, many neuroscientists used electrical stimulation to study the map of the motor cortex in many animals including monkeys, apes, and humans.

One of the first detailed maps of the human motor cortex was described in 1905 by Campbell. He did autopsies on the brains of amputees. A person who had lost an arm would over time apparently lose some of the neuronal mass in the part of the motor cortex that normally controls the arm. Likewise, a person who had lost a leg would show degeneration in the leg part of motor cortex. In this way the motor map could be established. In the period between 1919 and 1936 others mapped the motor cortex in detail using electrical stimulation, including the husband and wife team Vogt and Vogt, and the neurosurgeon Foerster.

Perhaps the best-known experiments on the human motor map were published by Penfield in 1937. Using a procedure that was common in the 1930s, he examined epileptic patients who were undergoing brain surgery. These patients were given a local anesthetic, their skulls were opened, and their brains exposed. Then, electrical stimulation was applied to the surface of the brain to map out the speech areas. In this way, the surgeon would be able to avoid any damage to speech circuitry. The brain focus of the epilepsy could then be surgically removed. During this procedure, Penfield mapped the effect of electrical stimulation in all parts of the cerebral cortex, including motor cortex.

Penfield is sometimes mistakenly considered to be the motor cortex map discoverer. It was discovered approximately 70 years before his work. However, Penfield drew a picture of a human-like figure stretched over the cortical surface and used the term &quot;homunculus&quot; (diminutive of &quot;homo&quot;, Latin for &quot;man&quot;) to refer to it. It is perhaps for this reason that his work has become so popular in neuroscience. Penfield knew the homunculus idea was a caricature. He stated, &#x27;&quot;It is a cartoon of representation in which scientific accuracy is impossible&quot;&#x27;. Nearly fifty years before, Sherrington (1906) made the point more cogently stating &quot;&#x27;The student looking over the political map map of a continent may little realise the complexity of the populations and states so simply represented. We looking at the brain chart of the text book may never forget the unspeakable complexity of the reactions thus rudely symbolised and spatially indicated&quot;´. While pictures of an orderly representation of limb segments across the cortical surface (such as the one shown above) have endured in textbooks, they are erroneous and misleading.

==The motor cortex map==
A simple view, that is almost certainly too limited and that dates back to the earliest work on the motor cortex, is that neurons in the motor cortex control movement by a feed-forward direct pathway. In that view, a neuron in the motor cortex sends an axon or projection to the spinal cord and forms a synapse on a motor neuron. The motor neuron sends an electrical impulse to a muscle. When the neuron in the cortex becomes active, it causes a muscle contraction. The greater the activity in the motor cortex, the stronger the muscle force. Each point in the motor cortex controls a muscle or a small group of related muscles. This description is only partly correct.

Most neurons in the motor cortex that project to the spinal cord synapse on interneuron circuitry in the spinal cord, not directly onto motor neurons. One suggestion is that the direct, cortico-motoneuronal projections are a specialization that allows for the fine control of the fingers.

The view that each point in the motor cortex controls a muscle or a limited set of related muscles was debated over the entire history of research on the motor cortex, and was suggested in its strongest and most extreme form by Asanuma on the basis of experiments in cats and monkeys using electrical stimulation. However, almost every other experiment to examine the map, including the classic work of Ferrier and of Penfield showed that each point in the motor cortex influences a range of muscles and joints. The map is greatly overlapping. The overlap in the map is generally greater in the premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex, but even the map in the primary motor cortex controls muscles in an extensively overlapped manner. Many studies have demonstrated the overlapping representation of muscles in the motor cortex. To be clear as to what the often used term &#x27;overlapping map&#x27; actually means, it is better to state that muscles are represented many times over on the cortical surface in non-contiguous loci, intermingled with the representation of other muscles acting at the same, or at a different, joint.

It is believed that as an animal learns a complex movement repertoire, the motor cortex gradually comes to coordinate among muscles.

The clearest example of the coordination of muscles into complex movement in the motor cortex comes from the work of Graziano and colleagues on the monkey brain. They used electrical stimulation on a behavioral time scale, such as for half a second instead of the more typical hundredth of a second. They found that this type of stimulation of the monkey motor cortex often evoked complex, meaningful actions. For example, stimulation of one site in the cortex would cause the hand to close, move to the mouth, and the mouth to open. Stimulation of another site would cause the hand to open, rotate until the grip faced outward, and the arm to project out as if the animal were reaching. Different complex movements were evoked from different sites and these movements were mapped in the same orderly manner in all monkeys tested. Computational models showed that the normal movement repertoire of a monkey, if arranged on a sheet such that similar movements are placed near each other, will result in a map that matches the actual map found in the monkey motor cortex. This work suggests that the motor cortex does not truly contain a homunculus-type map of the body. Instead, the deeper principle may be a rendering of the movement repertoire onto the cortical surface. To the extent that the movement repertoire breaks down partly into the actions of separate body parts, the map contains a rough and overlapping body arrangement noted by researchers over the past century.

A similar organization by typical movement repertoire has been reported in the posterior parietal cortex of monkeys and galagos and in the motor cortex of rats and mice. Notwithstanding, direct tests of the idea that the motor cortex contains a movement repertoire have not corroborated this hypothesis. Varying the initial position of the forelimb does not change the muscle synergies evoked by microstimulation of a motor cortical point. Consequently, the evoked movements reach nearly the same final end point and posture, with variability. However, the movement trajectories are quite different depending on the initial limb posture and the starting position of the paw. The evoked movement trajectory is most natural when the forelimb lays pendant ~ perpendicular to the ground (i.e., in equilibrium with the gravitational force). From other starting positions, the movements do not appear natural. The paths of the paw are curved with changes and reversals of direction and the passive influence of the gravitational force on the movements is obvious. These observations demonstrate that while the output of the cortical point evokes a seemingly coordinated limb movement from a rest position, it does not specify a particular movement direction or a controlled trajectory from other initial positions. Thus, in natural conditions a controlled movement must depend on the coordinated activation of a multitude of cortical points, terminating at a final locus of motor cortical activity, which holds the limb at a spatial location. These findings are inconsistent with the idea of the representation of the movement repertoire on the cortical surface.

==Evolution==

Mammals evolved from mammal-like reptiles over 200 million years ago. These early mammals developed several novel brain functions most likely due to the novel sensory processes that were necessary for the nocturnal niche that these mammals occupied. These animals most likely had a somatomotor cortex, where somatosensory information and motor information were processed in the same cortical region. This allowed for the acquisition of only simple motor skills, such as quadrupedal locomotion and striking of predators or prey. Placental mammals evolved a discrete motor cortex about 100 mya. According to the principle of proper mass, &quot;the mass of neural tissue controlling a particular function is appropriate to the amount of information processing involved in performing the function.&quot; This suggests that the development of a discrete motor cortex was advantageous for placental mammals, and the motor skills that these organisms acquired were more complex than their early-mammalian ancestors. Further, this motor cortex was necessary for the arboreal lifestyles of our primate ancestors.

Enhancements to the motor cortex (and the presence of opposable thumbs and stereoscopic vision) were evolutionarily selected to prevent primates from making mistakes in the dangerous motor skill of leaping between tree branches (Cartmill, 1974; Silcox, 2007). As a result of this pressure, the motor system of arboreal primates has a disproportionate degree of somatotopic representation of the hands and feet, which is essential for grasping (Nambu, 2011; Pons et al., 1985; Gentilucci et al., 1988).

<text>Qualcomm code-excited linear prediction (QCELP), also known as Qualcomm PureVoice, is a speech codec developed in 1994 by Qualcomm to increase the speech quality of the IS-96A codec earlier used in CDMA networks. It was later replaced with EVRC since it provides better speech quality with fewer bits. The two versions, &quot;QCELP8&quot; and &quot;QCELP13&quot;, operate at 8 and 13 kilobits per second (Kbit/s) respectively.

In CDMA systems, a QCELP vocoder converts a sound signal into a signal transmissible within a circuit. In wired systems, voice signals are generally sampled at 8 kHz (that is, 8,000 sample values per second) and then encoded by 8-bit quantization for each sample value. Such a system transmits at 64 kbit/s, an expensive rate in a wireless system. A QCELP vocoder with variable rates can reduce the rate enough to fit a wireless system by coding the information more efficiently. In particular, it can change its own coding rates based on the speaker&#x27;s volume or pitch; a louder or higher-pitched voice requires a higher rate.

The ADM was established in the buildup to the January 2001 parliamentary elections as an alliance of the Democratic and Independent Cape Verdean Union (UCID), the Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) and the Labour and Solidarity Party (PTS). The alliance received 6% of the vote, winning two seats in the National Assembly. In the presidential elections a month later, ADM candidate Jorge Carlos Fonseca finished third of the four candidates with 3% of the vote.

The parties contested the next elections in 2006 separately, with UCID winning two seats.

<text>Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV) is variable bitrate speech coding standard used in CDMA2000 networks. SMV provides multiple modes of operation that are selected based on input speech characteristics.
==Technical specification==
===Codecs===
The SMV for Wideband CDMA is based on 4 codecs: full rate at 8.5 kbit/s, half rate at 4 kbit/s, quarter rate at 2 kbit/s, and eighth rate at 800 bit/s. The full rate and half rate are based on the CELP algorithm that is based on a combined closed-loop-open-loop-analysis (COLA). In SMV the signal frames are first classified as:

* Silence/Background noise
* Non-stationary unvoiced
* Stationary unvoiced
* Onset
* Non-stationary voiced
* Stationary voiced
===Algorithm===
The algorithm includes voice activity detection (VAD) followed by an elaborate frame classification scheme. Silence/background noise and stationary unvoiced frames are represented by spectrum-modulated noise and coded at 1/4 or 1/8 rate. The SMV uses 4 subframes for full rate and two/three subframes for half rate. The stochastic (fixed) codebook structure is also elaborate and uses sub-codebooks each tuned for a particular type of speech. The sub-codebooks have different degrees of pulse sparseness (more sparse for noise like excitation). SMV scores a high of 3.6 MOS at full rate with clean speech.

The coder works on a frame of 160 speech samples (20 ms) and requires a look ahead of 80 samples (10 ms) if noise-suppression option B is used. An additional 24 samples of look ahead is required if noise-suppression option A is used. So the algorithmic delay for the coder is 30 ms with noise-suppression option B and 33 ms with noise-suppression option A.

The next evolution of CDMA speech codecs is VMR-WB which provides much higher speech quality with wideband while fitting to the same networks.

SMV can be also used in 3GPP2 container file format – 3G2.

By 2010, the largest bill pay kiosk network was AT&amp;T, which allowed for phone customers to pay their bills. Verizon and Sprint have also introduced similar units over time.

Early interactive kiosks sometimes resembled telephone booths, but have been embraced by retail, food service, and hospitality to improve customer service and streamline operations. Interactive kiosks are typically placed in the high foot traffic settings such as shops, hotel lobbies, or airports.

The integration of technology allows kiosks to perform a wide range of functions, evolving into self-service kiosks. For example, kiosks may enable users to order from a shop&#x27;s catalog when items are not in stock, check out a library book, look up information about products, issue a hotel key card, enter a public utility bill account number to perform an online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise. Customized components such as coin hoppers, bill acceptors, card readers, and thermal printers enable kiosks to meet the owner&#x27;s specialized needs.

==History==
The first self-service, interactive kiosk was developed in 1977 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign by a pre-med student, Murray Lappe. The content was created on the PLATO computer system and accessible by the plasma touch-screen interface. The plasma display panel was invented at the University of Illinois by Donald L. Bitzer. Lappe&#x27;s kiosk, called The Plato Hotline allowed students and visitors to find movies, maps, directories, bus schedules, extracurricular activities, and courses.

The first successful network of interactive kiosks used for commercial purposes was a project developed by the shoe retailer Florsheim Shoe Co., led by their executive VP, Harry Bock, installed circa 1985. The interactive kiosk was created, manufactured, and customized by ByVideo Inc. of Sunnyvale, California. The network of over 600 kiosks provided images and video promotion for customers who wished to purchase shoes that were not available in the retail location. Style, size, and color could be selected, and the product paid for on the kiosk itself. The transaction was sent to the Florsheim mainframe in St, Louis, MO, via dialup lines, for next-day home or store delivery via Federal Express. The hardware (including a microcomputer, display system, touchscreen) was designed and built by ByVideo, while other components (like the CRT, floppy disk, printer, keyboard, and physical housing) were sourced from other vendors. The videodisc material was created quarterly by ByVideo at Florsheim&#x27;s direction, in ByVideo&#x27;s state-of-the-art video production facility in California. This kiosk network operated for over 6 years in Florsheim retail locations.

In 1991, the first commercial kiosk with an Internet connection was displayed at Comdex. The application was for locating missing children. The first true documentation of a kiosk was the 1995 report by Los Alamos National Laboratory which detailed what the interactive kiosk consisted of. This was first announced on comp.infosystems.kiosks by Arthur, the original Usenet moderator.

In 1997, was launched to provide a tradeshow for organizations looking to deploy interactive self-service kiosks. These trade shows used to occur twice a year, and offer companies education and demonstrations for successful self-service deployments.

The first company to launch a statewide interactive kiosk program was Imperial Multimedia in 2007. Imperial Multimedia installed interactive kiosks in 31 of Virginia&#x27;s State Parks and these electronic kiosks included park overviews, printable maps, waypoints, points of interest, video tours of trails, and emergency information.

Today&#x27;s kiosks are usually found in the airport at departure and also baggage, QSR, and fast casual self-order deployments have greatly expanded. There are now restaurants that orders only come in via mobile or kiosks. With the COVID-19 outbreak, new kiosk iterations such as the temperature screening kiosk have seen exponential growth in a very short time. Bill payment kiosks for AT&amp;T and Verizon are expanding as well.

==Design and construction==

The aesthetic and functional design of interactive kiosks is a key element that drives user adoption, overall up-time, and affordability. There are many factors to consider when designing an interactive kiosk including:
* Aesthetic design: The design of the enclosure is often the driving factor in user adoption and brand recognition.
* Manufacturing volume: This will determine which manufacturing processes are appropriate to use (i.e. sheet-metal, thermoformed plastic, etc.).
* Kiosk software: The interactive function of the kiosk hardware is largely determined by the software program and kiosk software configuration.
* Graphic messaging: Plays a key role in communicating with potential users.
* Maintenance and thermal design: Critical to maximizing up-time (the time between failures or crashes).
* Component specification: Typical components include touchscreen, P.C., pointing device, keyboard, bill acceptor, mag-stripe and/ or bar-code scanner, surge protector, UPS, etc.
* Ergonomic: Is important to ensure comfortable and easy user accessibility.
* Regulatory compliance: In the US it is important to design to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Electrical standards include UL in the U.S. and CE in Europe. In the retail space, Payment Card Industry (PCI) certification exists in the U.S. which is a descendant of VISA PED (relative of Chip and PIN in Europe).
* Interface design: Designing for interactive kiosks typically requires larger buttons and simpler decision trees than designing for a web or computer-based interactive. Catchy attractive animations and short dwell times are important.
* Durability: The intended location of the kiosk will largely influence the construction as materials and electronic requirements are significantly different for indoor vs. outdoor kiosks.

==Interactive kiosks around the world==

===Government usage===
Several countries historically implemented the nationwide installation of kiosks for various purposes. One example of such large scale installations can be found in the United Kingdom, where thousands of special-purpose kiosks are now available to aid job-seekers in finding employment.

The United States Department of Homeland Security has created immigration kiosks where visitors register when they enter the United States. There are also exit kiosks where visitors register when they leave the U.S.

The postal service has automated kiosks in many of the postal offices for self-service.

The Veterans Administration has over 5,000 patient kiosks deployed. In 2020 the next generation kiosks along with mobile check-in for veterans began.

In India, digital kiosks are used for various purposes, such as payment of bills.

===Industry usage===
It is estimated that over 1,200,000 kiosk terminals exist in the U.S. and Canada alone.

Groups who use kiosks in their business environment include: Delta Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue Airways, GTAA, Future Shop, The Home Depot, Target Corporation, and Wal-Mart.

==Types of kiosks==

===Telekiosk===
The telekiosk can be considered the technical successor to the telephone booth, a publicly accessible set of devices that are used for communication. These can include email, fax, SMS, as well as standard telephone service. The telekiosk is rarely seen any more.

Telekiosks gradually appeared around the United Kingdom in the first years of the 21st century. Some are situated in shopping centers and transport terminals, to provide detailed local information. Others are in public places, including motorway service areas and airports.

The International Telecommunication Union is promoting the use of the telekiosk in Africa and parts of Asia where local people do not have access to communications technology. In part, this work addresses the &quot;digital divide&quot; between rich and poor nations. There are, however, great practical benefits. The scheme in Bhutan aims to provide an E-Post system, whereby messages are relayed by telephone, then delivered by hand to rural areas, easing the problems of transporting letters across the countryside. Health, agricultural and educational information is also available.

===Financial services kiosk===
The financial services kiosk can provide the ability for customers to perform transactions that may normally require a bank teller and maybe more complex and longer to perform than desired at an ATM. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;bank-in-a-box&quot; and the first prime example would be the Vcom units deployed at 7-Eleven in the U.S.

These units are generally referred to as &#x27;multi-function financial service kiosks&#x27; and the first iteration was back in the late 1990s with the VCOM product deployed in Southland (7-Eleven) convenience stores. Check-cashing, bill-payment and even dispensing cash cards. New multi-function machines have been deployed in &quot;c-store&quot; markets supported by Speedway and others.

===Photo kiosk===

An interactive kiosk allows users to print pictures from their digital images. The marquee example began with Kodak who had at one point had over 100,000 units up and running in the U.S. Many of these units were customized PCs with an LCD which would then print to the central printer in Customer service. Two major classes of photo kiosks exist:

Digital Order Stations -- This type of photo kiosk exists within retail locations and allows users to place orders for prints and photographic products. Products typically get produced in-store by a digital minilab, or at another location to be shipped directly to the consumer, or back to the store to be picked up at a later time. Digital Order Stations may or may not support instant printing, and typically do not handle payments.

Instant Print Stations - This type of photo kiosk uses internal printers to instantly create photographic prints for a self serve paying customer. Often located in public locations (hotels, schools, airports), Instant Print Stations handle payments. Often such systems will only print 4x6 inch prints, although popular dye-sublimation photo printers as of 2008 allow for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8x12. It is more a matter of resupply labor economics and chassis size.

===Internet kiosk===
An Internet kiosk is a terminal that provides public Internet access. Internet kiosks sometimes resemble telephone booths, and are typically placed in settings such as hotel lobbies, long-term care facilities, medical waiting rooms, apartment complex offices, or airports for fast access to e-mail or web pages. Internet kiosks sometimes have a bill acceptor or a credit card swipe, and nearly always have a computer keyboard, a mouse (or a fixed trackball which is more robust), and a monitor.

Some Internet kiosks are based on a payment model similar to vending machines or Internet cafés, while others are free. A common arrangement with pay-for-use kiosks has the owner of the Internet kiosk enter into a partnership with the owner of its location, paying either a flat rate for rental of the floor space or a percentage of the monthly revenue generated by the machine.

One of the first companies in North America to develop and deploy Internet kiosks with touch screens via user login and password was Streetspace Inc. based out of San Francisco, California. Starting in 1999 they deployed Internet kiosks across locations inside cafes, restaurants, and record shops in Berkeley, California. Streetspace was also one of the first companies to roll out targeted advertising and services to these Internet kiosks based on the location of the kiosk and the profile of the user when they logged into the terminal.

Internet kiosks have been the subject of hacker activity. Hackers will download spyware and catch user activity via keystroke logging. Other hackers have installed hardware keystroke logging devices that capture user activity.

Businesses that provide Internet kiosks are encouraged to use special Internet kiosk software and management procedures to reduce liability exposure.

===Ticketing kiosk===

Many amusement parks such as Disney have unattended outdoor ticketing kiosks. Amtrak has automated self-service ticketing kiosks. Busch Gardens uses kiosks for amusement parks. Lisbon Oceanarium has self-service ticketing kiosks by Partteam &amp; Oemkiosks. Cruise ships use ticketing kiosks for passengers. Check-in kiosks for auto rental companies such as Alamo and National have had national deployments.
The ticket halls of train stations and metro stations have ticketing kiosks that sell transit passes, train tickets, transit tickets, and train passes.

===Movie ticket kiosk===
Many movie theater chains have specialized ticket machines that allow their customers to purchase tickets and/or pick up tickets that were purchased online. Radiant and Fujitsu have been involved in this segment.

===Restaurant kiosk===
A new way to order in-cafe from tablet kiosks. Kiosks are available in addition to cashier stations so that wait time is reduced for all guests. The kiosk is highly visual and includes a product builder to assist with order accuracy and customization.

===DVD vending kiosk===
An example of a vending kiosk is that of the DVD rental kiosks, where a user can rent a DVD, secured by credit card. One of the largest was Redbox with a presence throughout North America.
===Visitor management and security kiosk===
Visitor management and security kiosk can facilitate the visitor check-in process at businesses, schools, and other controlled access environments. These systems can check against blacklists, run criminal background checks, and print access badges for visitors. School security concerns in the United States have led to an increase in these types of kiosks to screen and track visitors.

===Building directory and wayfinding kiosk===
Many shopping malls, hospitals, airports and other large public buildings use interactive kiosks to allow visitors to navigate in buildings. Harris County Hospital District, Baptist Hospital of Miami, the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Cayuga Medical Center are but a few medical centers utilizing interactive touch screen kiosks with a building directory and wayfinding solution.

===Hospital and medical clinic registration and check-in kiosks===
Hospitals and medical clinics are looking to kiosks to allow patients to perform routine activities. Kiosks that allow patients to check-in for their scheduled appointments and update their demographics to reduce the need to line up and interact with a registration clerk. In areas where patients must make a co-pay, kiosks will also collect payment. As the requirements for documentation, waivers, and consent increase, kiosks with integrated signature capture devices can present the documentation to the patient and collect their signature. A business case for registration and check-in kiosks is built around:
# workload reduction,
# data quality improvements,
# consistency of the registration process, and
# patient experience improvement.
A large community hospital has been able to reduce their registration staff by 30%, improve data quality, and shorten lineups.

Kiosks can display information customized to the user such as personalized messages helping them to manage their health.
===Information kiosk===
Museums, historical sites, national parks, and other tourists/visitor attractions often engage kiosks as a method for conveying information about a particular exhibit or site. Kiosks allow guests to read about - or view the video of - particular artifacts or areas at their own pace and in an interactive manner, learning more about those areas that interest them most. The Rockwell Museum in New York City uses touchscreen tablets to provide visitors with accessible and relevant labels for a particular exhibit. The Penn State All sports museum employs interactive kiosks to display up to date information about past and current Penn State athletes and sports teams. The Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration now boasts a citizen test available for visitors to take online via an informational kiosk. Additional kiosk displays include a &quot;Threads of Migration&quot; interactive exhibition featuring three touch-screen kiosks as part of &quot;The Journey: New Eras of Immigration&quot; section, which covers immigration since 1954.

===Video kiosk===
Video kiosk integrates video conferencing and collaboration capabilities to help users run video calls or conferences with available operators, view content or exchange messages. Video kiosks are often used in banking or telemedicine for improved customer service.

==Kiosk reliability==
Reliability is an important consideration, and as a result, many specialized kiosk software applications have been developed for the industry. These applications interface with the bill acceptor and credit card swipe, meter time, prevent users from changing the configuration of software or downloading computer viruses and allow the kiosk owner to see revenue. Threats to reliability come from vulnerabilities to hacking, allowing access to the OS, and the need for a session or hardware restart.

==Kiosk industry segments==
The kiosk industry is divided into four segments: kiosk enclosures, kiosk software (application and remote monitoring), components, service, and installation. Kiosk software provides the application for the users. A patient check-in or bill payment application are good templates. The software can also lock down the operating system (be it Apple, Windows, Android, or Linux or ChromeOS) to restrict access and/or functionality of a kiosk hardware device. USB devices and exposed external ports present security risks for example.

===Temperature kiosks===
Temperature kiosks began with the COVID-19 outbreak. They typically require no interaction except for the user to approach the terminal. A thermal imaging camera or a thermopile temperature sensor is typically used in conjunction with a camera to measure surface temperature (usually the forehead). Thermal imaging systems can drill down to the inner canthus which yields a more representative temperature. As of August 2020, temperature kiosks are still relatively unregulated by the FDA.

===Smart City kiosks===
The project in New York City lays out smart city kiosks. They are typically outdoor, larger than 42&quot;, and often two-sided. The idea is to provide Internet access on the street which means applications like Wayfinding or tie-ins to transportation systems come integrated.

===Kiosk manufacturing industry===
Historically, electronic kiosks though are stand-alone enclosures that accept user input, integrate many devices, include a software GUI application, and remote monitoring, and are deployed widely across all industry verticals. This is considered &quot;kiosk hardware&quot; within the kiosk industry.

POS-related &quot;kiosks&quot; are &quot;lane busting&quot; check-outs, such as seen at large retailers, like Home Depot and Kroger.

Simple touchscreen terminals or panel-pcs are another segment and enjoy most of their footprint in POS retail applications and typically facing the employee. Terminals include NCR Advantage (740x terminal) and the IBM Anyplace computer terminal. These units are considered &quot;kiosks&quot; only in functionality delivered and typically only incorporate touchscreen, bar code scanner, and/or magnetic stripe reader.

Market segments for kiosks and self-service terminal manufacturers include photo kiosks, government, airlines, internet, music, retail loyalty, HR, and financial services, just to name some.

===Customer flow, queue and check-in===

This segment includes healthcare patient check-in and &quot;take a number&quot; type custom flow. Devices range from simple ticket dispense to biometrics (fingerprint readers) for patient check-in.

The basic application of kiosks in the hotel industry is to reduce waiting time for guests at check-in/checkout and relieve the reception desk. Usually, hotel kiosks are located in the lobby and are integrated or interface with the hotel&#x27;s property management system. The machines allow guests to fill in and sign a registration card, select a room, issue hotel key cards, check for extra offers or upgrades, and book and pay for them. 
In retail, clients can place online orders in store for home delivery, avoid queuing in fast-food restaurants, and issue library books. Generally, kiosks are seen as an enhancement to a retail or hospitality offer rather than a replacing staff members.

===Regulatory issues===
The main regulatory issues are ADA and Accessibility, PCI-EMV, UL, CE, and HIPAA. There are many more regulations including state-specific regulations (e.g. Unruh Act in California). In 2019, the Kiosk Association released a new Code of Practice for Accessibility. It was presented to the entire U.S. Access Board in 2019.

<text>Carrozzeria Scaglietti () was an Italian automobile design and coachbuilding company active in the 1950s. It was founded by Sergio Scaglietti in 1951 as an automobile repair concern, but was located across the road from Ferrari in Maranello outside Modena, Italy.

Scaglietti gained Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s trust and respect both through his bodywork and design skills and for providing a retreat for young Dino Ferrari. Their professional relationship began when Ferrari asked Scaglietti to repair and modify race car bodywork in the late 1940s, which was soon followed by orders for full car bodies in the early 1950s. Scaglietti and Dino Ferrari designed a 166 MM, s/n 0050M, the first Ferrari to have a &quot;headrest&quot; bump. This feature was subsequently used on most racing Ferraris of the 1950s and 1960s. The idea was initially despised by Enzo but championed by Dino, and 0050M&#x27;s design became an overall success. The car became a prototype for the Monza range.

In the mid-1950s, Scaglietti became the &quot;Carrozzeria&quot; of choice for Ferrari&#x27;s racing efforts. Many sports racing prototypes were designed and manufactured at their facility. All those exclusively designed by Scaglietti carried the Scaglietti &amp; C. badge while cars built to outside designs did not. The company&#x27;s 1958 250 Testa Rossa, with its Formula One-inspired pontoon fenders, is one of the most famous Scaglietti designs. Several of Ferrari&#x27;s most coveted models such as the 250 California Spyder, 250 GTO and 250 Tour de France were built by Scaglietti to a Pinin Farina design.

Today, the former Scaglietti works is owned by Ferrari and used to produce Ferrari&#x27;s current line of aluminium bodied cars, including the 488 and F12, using both modern and traditional techniques. In 2002, a special edition of the 456, the 456M GT Scaglietti was named in honor of Scaglietti. This was followed by the 2004 introduction of the 612 Scaglietti, a 2+2 GT car produced until 2010. Despite names honoring Scaglietti, both the 456 and 612 were designed by Pininfarina.

Sergio Scaglietti died at his Modena home on 20 November 2011 at the age of 91.

<text>The Saastal or the Saas Valley is an alpine valley in the district of Visp, in the eastern part of the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. It is the valley of the river Saaser Vispa. It is separated from the Mattertal to the west by the Mischabel massif. Villages in the valley are, upstream, Eisten, Saas-Balen, Saas-Grund, Saas-Fee and Saas-Almagell.

Until 1893, the municipalities of Almagell, Balen, Fee and Grund were a single parish, with the only church in Grund. Mattmarksee is a reservoir built in the 1960s.

The region hosts an extensive winter sports region, comprising the separate ski areas of Saas-Fee, Saas-Grund and Saas-Almagell. As well as individual ski passes a combined pass is available; each of these areas is connected to the other parts of the region by postal bus, rather than dedicated skilifts.</text><links>

<text>The Democratic Convergence Party (, PCD) was a political party in Cape Verde.

==History==
The PCD was formed in 1994, following a split in the Movement for Democracy. In the 1995 parliamentary elections the party received 6.7% of the vote, winning a single seat in the 72-seat National Assembly.

In the buildup to the January 2001 parliamentary elections the party joined the Democratic Alliance for Change (ADM), a coalition including the Democratic and Independent Cape Verdean Union (UCID) and the Labour and Solidarity Party (PTS). The alliance received 6% of the vote, winning two seats in the National Assembly. In the presidential elections a month later, ADM candidate Jorge Carlos Fonseca finished third of the four candidates with 3% of the vote.

The alliance split prior to the 2006 parliamentary elections, which UCID and the PTS contested alone, while the PCD did not participate.

<doc id="1188621" wikidata="Q1045332" url="?curid=1188621" title="Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera">
<text>Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera is an Italian automobile coachbuilder. Originally established in Milan in 1925, Carrozzeria Touring became well known for both the beauty of its designs and patented superleggera construction methods. The business folded in 1966. In 2006 its brands and trademarks were purchased and a new firm was established nearby to provide automotive design, engineering, coachbuilding, homologation services, non-automotive industrial design, and restoration of historic vehicles.

Carrozzeria Touring was established on 25 March 1926 by Felice Bianchi Anderloni (1882–1948) and Gaetano Ponzoni. After achieving success through the middle of the 20th century, the business began to decline as automobile manufacturers replaced body-on-frame automobile construction with unitary design and increasingly took coachbuilding in-house.

After the original firm ceased production in 1966, Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni and Carrozzeria Marazzi preserved the &quot;Touring Superleggera&quot; trademark and used it on several occasions to support the company&#x27;s heritage. The trademark was acquired by the current owner, a family business, which began conducting its activities in 2006 under the name Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera S.r.l.; the new firm is headquartered nearby Milan, its hometown.

==History==
===Carrozzeria Falco becomes Carrozzeria Touring===
Carrozzeria Touring traces its roots to the 1926 purchase of a controlling interest in the Milan-based coachbuilder, Carrozzeria Falco, by Milanese lawyers Felice Bianchi Anderloni (1882–1948) and Gaetano Ponzoni from Carrozzeria Falco&#x27;s founder, Vittorio Ascari. The new owners changed the name of the firm to Carrozzeria Touring. Bianchi Anderloni, a former test driver for Isotta Fraschini and Peugeot Italia employee, assumed styling and engineering duties while Ponzoni assumed responsibility for administration of the firms business activities.

===Early work===
Carrozzeria Touring&#x27;s location at Via Ludovico da Breme 65 placed the coachbuilder near automobile manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Citroën and Isotta Fraschini. Predictably, Touring&#x27;s first bodywork assignments were for chassis produced by these companies.

===Development of the Superleggera construction system===
Bianchi Anderloni came to Touring more as an automobile designer than a car constructor, and learned the mechanics of the trade as the company progressed. The company licensed Charles Weymann&#x27;s system of fabric-covered lightweight frames, a predecessor of their own &quot;Superleggera&quot; construction system. Touring hired Giuseppe Seregni, who previously collaborated with Bianchi Anderloni on the 1927 Isotta Fraschini &#x27;Flying Star&#x27;, as Carrozzeria Touring&#x27;s first professional designer.

Touring&#x27;s skills with light alloy and fabric-covered tubing forms brought commercial success in aircraft production in the 1930s, leading Bianchi Anderloni to develop the Superleggera construction system, patented in 1936. This &quot;super lightweight&quot; system consists of a structure of small diameter tubes to form the body&#x27;s shape with thin alloy panels attached to cover and strengthen the framework. Additionally the system offered great versatility, allowing Touring to quickly construct innovative body shapes.

In 1937, at Mille Miglia, Alfa Romeo 6C 2300B was the first appearance of a Touring car built with the Superleggera system.

Prior to World War II, Touring gained fame for their Superleggera bodies, particularly those made for the Alfa Romes 8C 2900 and the BMW 328 chassis.

===Post WWII activities===
The company quickly re-energized after the war, with the Superleggera system widely licensed and copied. Felice Bianchi Anderloni died in 1948 and his son, Carlo Felice &quot;Cici&quot; Bianchi Anderloni, (1916–2003) took over management of the firm under the guidance of Ponzoni. The two would remain in charge of the firm until the company discontinued production in 1966. Chief designer at that time was Federico Formenti.

Formenti&#x27;s first major project was to create a body for the Ferrari 166 MM Touring barchetta, which debuted in 1948. Automotive design critic Robert Cumberford has referred to the body design for the 166 as &quot;One of the most charismatic shapes ever.&quot; The egg-crate grill of the 166 became a signature Ferrari design element and is still in use by Ferrari today.

Touring was particularly active late in the late 50s, with design and body production for the Pegaso Z-102, Alfa Romeo 1900 Super Sprint, Alfa Romeo 2600, Aston Martin DB4, Lancia Flaminia GT, Lamborghini 350, Lamborghini 400 GT and Maserati 3500 GT.

The Aston Martin DB4, the DB5 (famously driven by fictional character James Bond) and the DB6 were named after David Brown&#x27;s initials. He entrusted Touring Superleggera to design their next generation GT after the introduction of the successful DB2. The license agreement enabled Aston Martin to use the design and the &quot;Superleggera&quot; construction method at Newton Pagnell plant against a licence fee of £9 for each of the first 500 bodies and £5 for each further unit.

===Contract manufacturing===
Touring&#x27;s fortunes began to decline as automobile manufacturers replaced body-on-frame construction with monocoque construction. The carmakers began to build their own bodies in their production lines. However, they were not able to produce less than a few thousand units yearly. Therefore, they decided to assign the body production to coachbuilders. This led coachbuilders to invest in additional manufacturing capacity. Once Touring Superleggera had the new plant in Nova Milanese completed, market fluctuation caused the loss of contractors. The company had to wind-up in 1966, although bankruptcy never occurred.

===Legacy===
During the winding up, roughly 80% of Touring Superleggera&#x27;s archives caught fire. Seeking to reestablish a record of the firm&#x27;s production, Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni got in touch with every owner, creating the Touring Superleggera registry and leading it from 1995 on.

In 1995, he contributed to the revival of Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este, serving as president of the jury until his death in 2003. In his honor, the show began to award the &quot;Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni Memorial Trophy&quot; to the most elegant car with a body by Touring.

===21st century===


In 2006, a group of private investors specializing in high-end automotive makes, bought the brand and trademarks from the late owner. A newly created firm, Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera S.r.l. was established in Milan to provide automotive design, engineering, coachbuilding, homologation services, non-automotive industrial design, and restoration of historic vehicles.

At the 2008 Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este, Touring debuted the Bellagio Fastback Touring, based on the Maserati Quattroporte and the A8 GCS Berlinetta Touring, a concept car powered by a Maserati drivetrain. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Touring Bentley Continental Flying Star premiered: a shooting-brake model based on the Bentley Continental GTC, coach built in limited series, with the endorsement of Bentley.

In 2011, it was followed by Gumpert Tornante by Touring, a superfast Grand Tourer commissioned by the German sports car manufacturer.

On the stage of the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Touring Superleggera showcased a static style model based on the space-frame chassis of the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione. It was a tribute to the C52 Disco Volante, a racing car with a Touring Superleggera designed body introduced in 1952. The name in Italian stands for “Flying Saucer”. The Disco Volante was very streamlined, wind tunnel tested and with the body built on a tubular space frame.

The style model gave birth, in 2013 to the Alfa Romeo Disco Volante by Touring, a bespoke car limited-series of eight units that won that year&#x27;s Design Award at Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este.

Revealed in 2014, the MINI Superleggera Vision is a concept car created in collaboration with BMW Group. It is an electric roadster. Anders Warming, head of MINI design and Touring Superleggera merged their teams to &quot;explore new design languages for the British brand&quot;.

The Touring Berlinetta Lusso appeared in 2015. It is a street legal, 2-seater coupé featuring a three-volume form based on the Ferrari F12berlinetta. Like all modern Touring Superleggera models, it combines hand-beaten aluminium panels with carbon fibre. The series will be built in 5 units.
The Aero3 is a car introduced by Touring Superleggera in 2020. Its prominent rear fin was inspired by the aerodynamic berlinetta of the 1930s, particularly the Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Berlinetta Speciale Le Mans. The Aero3&#x27;s streamlined design features a rear spoiler and no rear window.

The Arese RH95 was introduced by Touring Superleggera in 2021 to commemorate the company&#x27;s 95th anniversary. It is Touring&#x27;s first entry into mid-engined designs. Six variations of the Arese RH95 were produced.

The Superleggera Veloce12 was unveiled at Monterey Car Week in 2024. It is a limited-edition grand tourer, based on Ferrari 550 Maranello, with only 30 models planned.

<text>Constance Baker Motley ( Baker; September 14, 1921 – September 28, 2005) was an American jurist and politician who served as a Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

A key strategist of the civil rights movement, she was state senator, and Borough President of Manhattan in New York City before becoming a United States federal judge. She obtained a role with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as a staff attorney in 1946 after receiving her law degree, and continued her work with the organization for more than twenty years.

She was the first Black woman to argue at the Supreme Court and argued 10 landmark civil rights cases, winning nine. She was a law clerk to Thurgood Marshall, aiding him in the case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education.&quot;

Motley was also the first Caribbean-American woman appointed to the federal judiciary, serving as a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In 1965, Motley was elected President of the Borough of Manhattan to fill a one-year vacancy. She was the first woman to hold the office.
As president, she authored a revitalization plan for Harlem and East Harlem, successfully fighting for $700,000 to improve these and other underserved areas of the city.

==Early life ==

Constance Baker was born on September 14, 1921, in New Haven, Connecticut, the ninth of twelve children. Her parents, Rachel Huggins and McCullough Alva Baker, were immigrants from the Caribbean Island Nevis. Before coming to the United States, Rachel worked as a seamstress and a teacher while McCullough worked as a cobbler. After they immigrated, her mother served as a domestic worker, and her father worked as a chef for different Yale University student societies, including the secret society Skull and Bones. Motley describes her parents&#x27; education as being equivalent &quot;to the tenth grade in the States&quot;. Her mother, Rachel Baker, served as a community activist. She founded the New Haven NAACP.

At 15, she read works by James Weldon Johnson and W.E.B. DuBois, which inspired her interest in Black history. She met a minister who taught classes in Black history that focused her attention on civil rights and the underrepresentation of black lawyers.

=== Education ===
While in high school, Motley became president of the New Haven Negro Youth Council and was secretary of the New Haven Adult Community Council. In 1939, she graduated with honors from Hillhouse High School. Although she had already formed a desire to practice law, Motley lacked the means to attend college, and instead went to work for the National Youth Administration. She also continued her involvement in community activities. Through this work she encountered local businessman and philanthropist Clarence W. Blakeslee, who, after hearing Motley speak at a New Haven community center, offered to pay for her education. With his financial help, she started college at Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, but after one year, she transferred to New York University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1943. She received her Bachelor of Laws in 1946 from Columbia Law School.

In October 1945, during her second year at Columbia Law School, future United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall hired her as a law clerk. She was assigned to work on court martial cases that were filed after World War II.

==Civil rights work==

Motley is widely acknowledged as a major figure in the Civil Rights Movement, especially its legal battles. After graduating from Columbia&#x27;s Law School in 1946, she was hired by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF) as a civil rights lawyer. As the fund&#x27;s first female attorney, she became Associate Counsel to the LDF, making her a lead trial attorney in a number of early and significant civil rights cases including representing Martin Luther King Jr., the Freedom Riders, and the Birmingham Children Marchers. She visited Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. while he sat in jail, as well as spent a night with civil rights activist Medgar Evers under armed guard.

In 1950, she wrote the original complaint in the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. The first African-American woman ever to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Meredith v. Fair&quot; she won James Meredith&#x27;s effort to be the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi in 1962. Motley was successful in nine of the ten cases she argued before the Supreme Court. The tenth decision, regarding jury composition, was eventually overturned in her favor. She was otherwise a key legal strategist in the civil rights movement, helping to desegregate Southern schools, buses, and lunch counters.

Beyond her work with LDF, Motley continued her civil rights work as an elected official. In 1964, she was elected to the New York State Senate and devoted much of her time to advocate for housing equality for majority-Black and Latino, low-income tenants. She also endorsed urban renewal projects and looked to improve the neighborhoods in New York City that needed aid.

==Political and judicial firsts==

Motley was elected on February 4, 1964, to the New York State Senate (21st district), to fill the vacancy caused by the election of James Lopez Watson to the New York City Civil Court. She was the first African American woman to sit in the State Senate. She took her seat in the 174th New York State Legislature, was re-elected in November 1964 to the 175th New York State Legislature, and resigned her seat when she was chosen as the first woman as Manhattan Borough President on February 23, 1965, after her predecessor was elected to a state judicial position. In November 1965, she was elected to a full four-year term. J. Raymond Jones was influential in helping her reach these positions.

==Federal judicial service==

Motley was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 26, 1966, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Judge Archie Owen Dawson. Senator James Eastland of Mississippi delayed her confirmation process for seven months. Eastland was in opposition to her past desegregation work including &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; and &quot;Meredith v. Fair&quot;. He used his influence as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee to disrupt Motley&#x27;s nomination, and went as far as accusing her of being a member of the Communist Party. Despite opposition, she was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 30, 1966, and received her commission the same day, becoming the first African American female federal judge. She served as Chief Judge from 1982 to 1986. She assumed senior status on September 30, 1986. Her service terminated on September 28, 2005, due to her death in New York City.

===Notable cases===

Motley was the presiding judge on the case of &quot;Blank v. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell&quot;, a landmark case for women lawyers. In &quot;Blank,&quot; the plaintiffs accused a law firm of sex discrimination. Due to the nature of this case and Motley&#x27;s gender and race, there were calls for her to withdraw from the case assuming she would be biased. In response, she pointed to her history of impartial decisions, sometimes ruling against the plaintiff in discrimination cases.

In , another highly publicized case, Motley admonished the New York City police for not providing Vietnam war protesters with adequate protection against violence in the streets.

Motley ruled against the plaintiff in the case of &quot;Mullarkey v. Borglum&quot; in 1970. This case involved female tenants in New York City arguing that their male landlord was violating their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The defendants cited the landlord&#x27;s overreach of power but failed to detail the landlord&#x27;s legal failings. Motley ruled in favor of the defendant, rejecting the plaintiffs&#x27; claim of sex discrimination and going against her former advocacy for tenants during her time in the New York State Senate.

Motley handed down a breakthrough decision for women in sports reporting in 1978, when she ruled that a female reporter must be allowed into a Major League Baseball locker room. In &quot;Ludtke v. Kuhn,&quot; Melissa Ludtke filed a lawsuit against Bowie Kuhn, the Major League Baseball Commissioner, The American League President Leland MacPhail, and three New York City officials over the New York Yankees gendered policy forbidding female sports reporters from entering the Yankees locker room.

==Honors and awards==

Motley received a Candace Award for Distinguished Service from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1984.

In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2000, Harvard University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Laws.

In 2001, President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Citizens Medal.

The NAACP awarded her the Spingarn Medal, the organization&#x27;s highest honor, in 2003. Motley was a prominent honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

In 2006, Motley posthumously received the Congressional Gold Medal from Congress for all of her accomplishments during her lifetime.

In 2011, she was honored posthumously with the 13th Ford Freedom Award for her accomplishments that helped disadvantaged communities.

In 2016, the Chester, Connecticut Land Trust purchased land across from her former second home. The parcel was eventually dedicated as the &quot;Judge Constance Baker Motley Preserve&quot;. A small kiosk, picnic area, and trail are available to the public.

On October 6, 2019, her property located in Chester, Connecticut, was designated a site on the Connecticut Freedom Trail. The site is just one of 140 that honor African-Americans throughout the state.

In 2021, the New York City Parks Department renamed the 54th Street Recreation Center in honor of Motley.

The Harlem Historical Society authored a street co-naming resolution honoring Motley for her service as an American civil rights activist, lawyer, judge, state senator, and Harlem resident. The portion of Edgecombe Avenue between 159th and 160th streets was co-named &quot;Constance Baker Motley Place&quot;.

==Personal life==

Constance Baker married Joel Motley Jr., a real estate and insurance broker, in 1946 at Saint Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New Haven, Connecticut. They lived in Harlem, New York City and maintained a second home in Chester, Connecticut from 1965 until her death in 2005.

Baker and Motley were married for 59 years, until her death of congestive heart failure on September 28, 2005, fourteen days after her 84th birthday, at NYU Downtown Hospital in New York City. Her funeral was held at the Connecticut church where she had been married; a public memorial service was held at Riverside Church in Manhattan.

She left one son, Joel Wilson Motley III, co-chairman of Human Rights Watch, and three grandchildren. During the early twenty-first century, Motley became a part of the Just The Beginning Foundation, a foundation dedicated to preserving African American judges who improve the African American community through their work.

==Legacy==

During her time as a federal judge for the Southern District of New York, Motley made efforts to reach out to other African-American women in her position. One of the women she reached out to was Judge Anne Elise Thompson who received a personal note from Motley on the day she was appointed to be a judge for the District of New Jersey.

In 2005, the University of Pennsylvania Law School&#x27;s American Constitution Society (ACS) student chapter began to host National Writing Competitions annually in honor of Constance Baker Motley.

With her work on &quot;Ludtke v. Kuhn&quot;, Motley became a pivotal figure to Melissa Ludtke. Ludtke published an article in 2018 praising the work that Motley accomplished throughout her life despite the discrimination she experienced.

Judith Heumann, co-founder of the World Institute on Disability, credits Motley with her becoming the first licensed teacher in the state of New York who used a wheelchair.

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris explicitly cites Motley&#x27;s influence on her own political and law career on her campaign page.

Federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson cited Motley as an influence on her own career in a speech accepting President Joe Biden&#x27;s nomination to become an associate justice of the Supreme Court. Jackson and Motley share the same birthday.

An award-winning biographical documentary, &quot;Justice is a Black Woman: The Life and Work of Constance Baker Motley&quot;, was broadcast on Connecticut Public Television in 2012. A documentary short, &quot;The Trials of Constance Baker Motley&quot;, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2015.

In 2022, &quot;Civil Rights Queen&quot;, an &quot;immersive&quot; biography of Motley, was published.

On January 31, 2024, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp to honor Motley. The first day of issue ceremony took place at the Constance Baker Motley Recreation Center in New York City and was presided over by the Honorable Anton Hajjar, member of the U.S. Postal Service Board. This stamp was the 47th in the Black Heritage series of U.S. postage stamps.

<text>Edward Charles &quot;Ed&quot; Mandrake (born October 1, 1938 in Ethelbert, Manitoba – May 2, 2010) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the west-end Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

The son of Walter Mandrake, he was educated at the Red River Community College, receiving a certificate in motor vehicle work. He worked in vehicle body repair before entering politics. Mandrake also served with the Canadian Army which he joined in 1956, holding administrative posts in Canada and Europe. He was honourably released with the rank of Warrant Officer in 1968. In 1958, he married Marie Wiwchar.

Mandrake first ran for office in the 1988 provincial election, and defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Ric Nordman by 187 votes in Assiniboia. The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one seat to twenty in this election, and Mandrake sat as a member of the official opposition. Liberal support trailed off in the provincial election of 1990, and he was defeated by PC candidate Linda McIntosh. He did not seek a return to political office.

Mandrake later joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In 2003, he signed a petition opposing the party&#x27;s merger with the Canadian Alliance.

He died at the Victoria General Hospital in Winnipeg at the age of 71.
