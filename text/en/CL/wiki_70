<text>DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework originally created by Sun Microsystems for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time. 
Originally developed for Solaris, it has since been released under the free Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) in OpenSolaris and its descendant illumos, and has been ported to several other Unix-like systems.

DTrace can be used to get a global overview of a running system, such as the amount of memory, CPU time, filesystem and network resources used by the active processes. It can also provide much more fine-grained information, such as a log of the arguments with which a specific function is being called, or a list of the processes accessing a specific file.

In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and announced the discontinuation of OpenSolaris. 
As a community effort of some core Solaris engineers to create a truly open source Solaris, illumos operating system was announced via webinar on Thursday, 3 August 2010, as a fork on OpenSolaris OS/Net consolidation, including DTrace technology.

In October 2011, Oracle announced the porting of DTrace to Linux, and in 2019 official DTrace for Fedora is available on GitHub. For several years an unofficial DTrace port to Linux was available, with no changes in licensing terms.

In August 2017, Oracle released DTrace kernel code under the GPLv2+ license, and user space code under GPLv2 and UPL licensing. In September 2018 Microsoft announced that they had ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows.

In September 2016 the OpenDTrace effort began on github with both code and comprehensive documentation of the system&#x27;s internals. The OpenDTrace effort maintains the original CDDL licensing for the code from OpenSolaris with additional code contributions coming under a BSD 2 Clause license. The goal of OpenDTrace is to provide an OS agnostic, portable implementation of DTrace that is acceptable to all consumers, including macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Linux as well as embedded systems.

== Description ==
Sun Microsystems designed DTrace to give operational insights that allow users to tune and troubleshoot applications and the OS itself.

Testers write tracing programs (also referred to as scripts) using the D programming language (not to be confused with other programming languages named &quot;D&quot;). The language, inspired by C, includes added functions and variables specific to tracing. D programs resemble AWK programs in structure; they consist of a list of one or more &quot;probes&quot; (instrumentation points), and each probe is associated with an action. These probes are comparable to a pointcut in aspect-oriented programming. Whenever the condition for the probe is met, the associated action is executed (the probe &quot;fires&quot;). A typical probe might fire when a certain file is opened, or a process is started, or a certain line of code is executed. A probe that fires may analyze the run-time situation by accessing the call stack and context variables and evaluating expressions; it can then print out or log some information, record it in a database, or modify context variables. The reading and writing of context variables allows probes to pass information to each other, allowing them to cooperatively analyze the correlation of different events.

Special consideration has been taken to make DTrace safe to use in a production environment. For example, there is minimal probe effect when tracing is underway, and no performance impact associated with any disabled probe; this is important since there are tens of thousands of DTrace probes that can be enabled. New probes can also be created dynamically.

==Command line examples==
DTrace scripts can be invoked directly from the command line, providing one or more probes and actions as arguments. Some examples:
# New processes with arguments
dtrace -n &#x27;proc:::exec-success { trace(curpsinfo-&gt;pr_psargs); }&#x27;

# Files opened by process
dtrace -n &#x27;syscall::open*:entry { printf(&quot;%s %s&quot;,execname,copyinstr(arg0)); }&#x27;

# Syscall count by program
dtrace -n &#x27;syscall:::entry { @num[execname] = count(); }&#x27;

# Syscall count by syscall
dtrace -n &#x27;syscall:::entry { @num[probefunc] = count(); }&#x27;

# Syscall count by process
dtrace -n &#x27;syscall:::entry { @num[pid,execname] = count(); }&#x27;

# Disk size by process
dtrace -n &#x27;io:::start { printf(&quot;%d %s %d&quot;,pid,execname,args[0]-&gt;b_bcount); }&#x27;

# Pages paged in by process
dtrace -n &#x27;vminfo:::pgpgin { @pg[execname] = sum(arg0); }&#x27;
Scripts can also be written which can reach hundreds of lines in length, although typically only tens of lines are needed for advanced troubleshooting and analysis. Over 200 examples of open source DTrace scripts can be found in the DTraceToolkit, created by Brendan Gregg (author of the DTrace book), which also provides documentation and demonstrations of each.

== Supported platforms ==
DTrace first became available for use in November 2003, and was formally released as part of Sun&#x27;s Solaris 10 in January 2005. DTrace was the first component of the OpenSolaris project to have its source code released under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL).

DTrace is an integral part of illumos and related distributions.

DTrace is a standard part of FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Apple added DTrace support in Mac OS X 10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;, including a GUI called Instruments. Over 40 DTrace scripts from the DTraceToolkit are included in /usr/bin, including tools to examine disk I/O (iosnoop) and process execution (execsnoop). Unlike other platforms that DTrace is supported on, Mac OS X has a flag (P_LNOATTACH) that a program may set that disallows tracing of that process by debugging utilities such as DTrace and gdb. In the original Mac OS X DTrace implementation, this could affect tracing of other system information, as unrelated probes that should fire while a program with this flag set was running would fail to do so. The OS X 10.5.3 update addressed this issue a few months later. However, since El Capitan, System Integrity Protection prevents user from DTracing protected binary by default.

The Linux port of DTrace has been available since 2008; work continues actively to enhance and fix issues. There is also an active implementation on github. Standard core providers are available (fbt, syscall, profile), plus a special &quot;instr&quot; provider (some of the Solaris providers are not yet available ). The Linux DTrace implementation is a loadable kernel module, which means that the kernel itself requires no modification, and thus allows DTrace to avoid CDDL vs. GPL licensing conflicts (in its source form, at least). However, once DTrace is loaded the kernel instance will be marked as tainted.

In 2007, a developer at QNX Software Systems announced on his blog that he and a colleague were working on incorporating DTrace into the QNX operating system.

Oracle Corporation added beta DTrace support for Oracle Linux in 2011, as a technology preview in the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel release 2, which is under GPLv2 (the DTrace Linux kernel module was originally released under CDDL). General availability was announced in December 2012.

On March 11, 2019, Microsoft released a version of DTrace for Windows 10 insider builds. Microsoft included DTrace as a built-in tool in Windows Server 2025.

== Language and application providers ==
With a supported &quot;language provider&quot;, DTrace can retrieve context of the code, including function, source file, and line number location. Further, dynamic memory allocation and garbage collection can be made available if supported by the language. Supported language providers include assembly language, C, C++, Java, Erlang, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, shell script, and Tcl.

&quot;Application providers&quot; allow DTrace to follow the operation of applications through system calls and into the kernel. Applications that offer DTrace application providers include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Oracle Grid Engine, and Firefox.

== Authors and awards ==
DTrace was designed and implemented by Bryan Cantrill, Mike Shapiro, and Adam Leventhal.

The authors received recognition in 2005 for the innovations in DTrace from &quot;InfoWorld&quot; and &quot;Technology Review&quot;. DTrace won the top prize in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s 2006 Technology Innovation Awards competition. The authors were recognized by USENIX with the Software Tools User Group (STUG) award in 2008.

<text>Anthony Palmer VC (10 March 1819 – 12 December 1892) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Career==
===Grenadier Guards===
Palmer was about 35 years old, and a private in the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.
On 5 November 1854 at the Battle of Inkerman, Crimea, Private Palmer, with two other men were the first to volunteer to go with Brevet Major Sir Charles Russell to dislodge a party of Russians from the Sandbag Battery. The attack succeeded. During this action Private Palmer shot down an assailant who was in the act of bayoneting Russell, and so saved his life. He was also one of a small band which, by a desperate charge against overwhelming numbers, saved the Colours of the battalion from capture.

===5th (Plaistow and Victoria Docks) Essex Rifle Volunteer Corps===
In 1874, Palmer was commissioned as a captain in the part-time 5th (Plaistow and Victoria Docks) Essex Rifle Volunteer Corps.

==Victoria Cross on display==
Palmer&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Grenadier Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London, England.

<doc id="1179143" wikidata="Q3530165" url="?curid=1179143" title="James Franklin (cricketer)">
<text>James Edward Charles Franklin (born 7 November 1980) is a New Zealand cricket coach and former cricketer, who played all forms of the game internationally.

Franklin played as a left-arm medium-fast bowler who swung the ball, and a middle order batsman who hit the ball with power. He began his career as a capable left-handed lower order batsman, but greatly improved his batting during his career. He is one of only two New Zealanders to take a hat-trick in Test cricket, a feat he achieved in October 2004 against Bangladesh.

==Playing career==
Domestically Franklin played for Wellington. He made his international debut in a One Day International (ODI) against Pakistan in early 2001 aged 20 as a result of a series of injuries to New Zealand&#x27;s bowlers. He made his Test debut in Auckland against Pakistan later in the year, collecting a pair and taking two wickets. In April 2006, he scored his maiden Test century, making 122 not out in the second Test against South Africa in Cape Town.

In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Franklin became the first man to take a wicket with the first ball of a match on World Cup debut. He scored two first-class double centuries, both for Wellington against Auckland, making 208 in 2005/06 and 219 in 2008/09.

Franklin played county cricket for Essex, Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex. On 6 February 2015, it was announced that James Franklin had signed for Middlesex, initially on a two-year contract, effectively retiring from international cricket. Due to a Northern Irish grandfather from Enniskillen, he was able to play as a domestic player, playing for the side until the end of the 2018 season.

He played in the Indian Premier League for Mumbai Indians, in the Bangladesh Premier League for Rajshahi Kings, in the Australian Big Bash League for Adelaide Strikers and in the Caribbean Premier League for Guyana Amazon Warriors and Barbados Tridents.

==Coaching career==
In January 2019 Franklin was appointed the head coach of Durham County Cricket Club. After four seasons, in which their high point was reaching the final of the 2021 Royal London One-Day Cup, he stepped down in September 2022. He is currently serving as the bowling coach of Islamabad United in the ongoing PSL 8.
He replaced Dale Steyn as the fast bowling coach of the IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad.

==Personal life==
He is married and has a son, Charlie Franklin, born on 15th November 2008.

<doc id="1179149" wikidata="Q6679347" url="?curid=1179149" title="Lord Henry Percy">
<text>General Lord Henry Hugh Manvers Percy, (22 August 1817 – 3 December 1877) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Outside his military career he was briefly a Conservative Member of Parliament.

==Background==
Henry Percy, fourth child and third son of George Percy, Lord Lovaine (later 2nd Earl of Beverley) by Louisa Harcourt Stuart-Wortley, third daughter of James Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, was born at Burwood House, Cobham, Surrey, on 22 August 1817. He was educated at Eton. He was styled Lord Henry Percy from 1865 after his father became 5th Duke of Northumberland at the age of 86. A collection of his papers is held at Alnwick Castle, the seat of the Duke of Northumberland.

==Military career and Crimean War==
He entered the British Army as an ensign in the Grenadier Guards on 1 July 1836, and was present during the insurrection in Canada in 1838. Aged 37, he served as a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, during the Crimean War of 1854–5. He was present at the Battle of Alma (where he was shot through the right arm), the Battle of Balaklava, the Battle of Inkerman (where he was again wounded), and the Siege of Sebastopol.

For his valour at the Battle of Inkerman on 5 November 1854 he was awarded the Victoria Cross with the following citation:

The subalterns in the company which Lieutenant-Colonel Percy commanded at Inkerman were Henry Neville and Sir James Fergusson, Bt. Neville was killed and Fergusson was wounded. Percy himself suffered during the action a black eye, gashes to the face and severe contusion on the back of the head. Forty-four members of his company were killed or wounded in the battle.

On Boxing Day 1854, Percy was taken ill with dysentery and Crimean Fever. He was therefore evacuated to the General Hospital, Scutari the following month. He survived the very high death rates which were prevalent in the hospitals of Scutari that winter and by mid February 1855 was well enough to be invalided back to England. He returned voluntarily to the Crimea in May and rejoined his regiment in the trenches before Sebastopol.

He was promoted to full colonel in the summer of 1855, and then held the local rank of brigadier general in command of the British-Italian Legion in Turin, where he arrived in August. The British-Italian Legion was a mercenary force raised following the passage of the 1854 Foreign Enlistment Act to fight for the allies (France, Great Britain and Turkey) in the Crimean War, modelled along the lines of similar foreign legions raised in the Napoleonic Wars. The Kingdom of Sardinia had already entered the Crimean war on the side of the allies and Count Cavour, Prime Minister of Sardinia, was in theory supportive of the British Government and Percy&#x27;s efforts to recruit and train a fighting force in Turin. However, the project became mired in bureaucracy, suffered from lack of funds and inadequate resources and was eventually rendered redundant by the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855 and a formal end to hostilities six months later. Given this, Percy resigned his command of the British-Italian Legion in October 1855 in a state of total exasperation.

After leaving the British-Italian Legion, Colonel Percy was asked by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, British Ambassador to Turkey, to attempt to relieve the Siege of Kars, Armenia, which was being defended by Brigadier-General Williams. However, Kars fell to the Russians on 28 November 1855, the day after Percy arrived in Constantinople, so the expedition was called off before it got under way.

Colonel Percy was an accomplished linguist and Turkophile, so in January 1856, after the armistice in the Crimea but before the signing of the Treaty of Paris in March 1856, he was ordered by General Codrington, Commander-in-chief of the British Army in the Crimea, to reconnoitre possible landing places in Asia Minor in case of a continuation of hostilities along the Caucasus front.

==Relations with the royal family==
From 29 June 1855 he was an aide-de-camp to the Queen – a post he held until 10 February 1865. He was gazetted for the Victoria Cross (VC) on 5 May 1857. As the most senior officer in the British Army to be awarded the VC during the Crimean War, Percy was on the occasion of the first investiture of the Victoria Cross in Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857 tasked with commanding the 62 recipients who had the decoration pinned to their breasts by Queen Victoria that day.

In the summer of 1861, as commanding officer at the Curragh, he was tasked with overseeing the Prince of Wales&#x27; military induction. Colonel Percy was well regarded by the royal family: Prince Albert had previously recommended that Percy&#x27;s infantry manual, &quot;Brigade Movements&quot; (1853) be distributed to every officer in the Brigade of Guards. In spite of the young Prince not being given as much commendation or responsibility in matters of drill as he had hoped, he liked Percy &#x27;very much&#x27; – perhaps because the latter, being a strict disciplinarian, insisted on treating him just like any other junior officer. However, the Curragh visit was marred by the Prince&#x27;s &#x27;fall&#x27;, following which Queen Victoria blamed her son for Prince Albert&#x27;s death. &#x27;The fall&#x27; came in the form of initiation in carnal pleasure with the actress Nellie Clifden, as arranged by junior officers at the Curragh.

==Later military career==
On the occurrence of the Trent Affair in December 1861, Percy was sent to New Brunswick in command of the first battalion of the Grenadier Guards. He had been promoted to be major in 1860, but retired from active service on 3 October 1862 owing to the chronic ill health he had suffered ever since the Crimean War. However, he remained on half-pay and briefly commanded a brigade at Aldershot – the place to which he and another Grenadier officer, Col. F. W. Hamilton, had first brought the army in 1853 when they selected Aldershot Heath and its surrounding area as a new training ground.

In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, he was sent by the Duke of Cambridge, Commander-in-Chief, as an observer with the Prussian Army at Sedan.

On 24 May 1873 he was gazetted a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He was also rewarded for his military services by being appointed to the colonelcy of the 89th (The Princess Victoria&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot on 28 May 1874. He became a full general on 1 October 1877.

==Politics==
He succeeded his brother, Lord Lovaine, as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Northumberland North from 1865 to 1868.

He was found dead in his bed at his residence, 40 Eaton Square, London, on 3 December 1877, and was buried in the Percy family vault in St. Nicholas&#x27; Chapel, Westminster Abbey on 7 December. He was unmarried.

<text>Yahgan or Yagán (also spelled Yaghan, Jagan, Iakan, and also known as Yámana, Háusi Kúta, or Yágankuta) is an extinct language that is one of the indigenous languages of Tierra del Fuego, spoken by the Yahgan people. It is regarded as a language isolate, although some linguists have attempted to relate it to Kawésqar and Chono.

Yahgan was also spoken briefly on Keppel Island in the Falkland Islands at a missionary settlement. In 2017, Chile&#x27;s National Corporation of Indigenous Development convened a workshop to plan an educational curriculum in the Yahgan language, and in June 2019 it planned to inaugurate a language nest in the community of Bahía Mejillones, near Puerto Williams. The government also funded the publication of a &quot;concise and illustrated dictionary&quot; of the Yahgan language.

Following the death of Cristina Calderón (1928–2022) of Villa Ukika on Navarino Island, Chile, no native speakers of Yahgan remain.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
There are three analyses of the phonological system of Yahgan, which differ in many details from one another. The oldest analysis is Thomas Bridges&#x27; dictionary (1894) based on the English Phonotypic Alphabet; from the middle of the 20th century by Haudricourt (1952) and Holmer (1953); and towards the end of the 20th century, by Guerra Eissmann (1990), Salas y Valencia (1990), and Aguilera (2000).

All vowels are long in stressed syllables. Vowel is the most frequent. It may be pronounced as a schwa in syllables in pretonic or post-tonic position. In final tonic syllables, vowels and may become a diphthong. Vowels and are very unstable in final unaccented syllables, alternating with and respectively.

===Consonants===
===Morphophonology===
Yahgan shows a number of sandhi effects on consonants and vowels. For instance, the terminal of &#x27;to see, recognize&#x27; when affixed by &#x27;to have trouble/difficulty doing&#x27; becomes :- of &#x27;have trouble recognizing/seeing&#x27;

In syllables reduced through morphophonetic processes, terminal vowels (, ) of original bisyllables will often drop (except for , which tends to remain, leaving previous material unaffected), and resultant final stops will fricativize (r becomes sh). Aside from losing stress, any vowels preceding these shifted consonants will often shift from tense to lax. Ex. &#x27;for self, with one&#x27;s own&#x27; &gt; . &#x27;to take, convey&#x27; &gt; , and so on. Present tense usually results in the dropping of the final vowel of the infinitival form of the verb and associated changes as above, as does affixation by many, but not all, further derivational and inflectional suffixes beginning with stops, affricates, and other consonants. Ex. &#x27;to fight&#x27; &#x27;to fight confusedly&#x27;.

The sounds m, n, and l are particularly labile in some environments. &#x27;to eat&#x27; &#x27;to leave off eating&#x27; (not ). n from &#x27;state&#x27; is often reduced to -V: when one would expect -Vn-. lt can disappear entirely before some consonants. &#x27;to drink&#x27;, or &#x27;to drink&#x27;. Initial h- in roots and affixes drops in many instances. Ex. &#x27;to float, be in boat&#x27;+ &#x27;to walk, go&#x27; gives . ng (as in English &#x27;hang&#x27;) is purely morphophonetic, from terminal n before a velar consonant. Many instances of m before a labial consonant are similarly motivated. w after a passive/reflexive prefix often drops. w often vocalizes to u: or o: or drops (depending on preceding material): causative plus &#x27;work&#x27; is &#x27;make work&#x27;. y is also relatively labile- after reduced &gt; the suffix &#x27;to leave off&#x27; becomes . In combination with preceding -a y often vocalizes: &#x27;woman&#x27; plus &#x27;plural animates/people&#x27; becomes .

===Stress===
In recent analyses of the speech of remaining speakers, word stress was felt to be nondistinctive. However, in the mid-19th century Yahga Strait dialect (which is likely not the ancestor of the surviving one) word stress was distinctive at least at the level of the individual morpheme, with stress shifting in regular patterns during word formation. Certain otherwise identical word roots are distinguishable by different stress marking. No information is available about phrase or clause level stress phenomena from the Yahga dialect.

Some roots, particularly those with doubled consonants, exhibit stress on both vowels flanking the doublet. Diphthongs appear to attract stress when they are morphophonetic in origin, sometimes removing it from vowels on both sides that would otherwise be stressed. The first vowel -V- (influenced by the preceding terminal root vowel) in &#x27;(be) in a state&#x27; also appears to attract stress, while &#x27;attain&#x27; repels stress to the left. Thus the combination &#x27;get into a state&#x27; is harmonious. Diphthongal attraction often trumps , drawing stress further left, while two successive diphthongs often have the stress on the rightmost one (counterintuitively). Syllables reduced morphophonetically generally lose whatever stress they might have carried. The vast majority of &#x27;irregular&#x27; stress renderings in Bridges&#x27; original dictionary manuscript seem to arise from just these five sources.

It may be that these effects help to preserve morpheme boundary and identity information. For instance, given the importance of derivation of verbs from nouns and adjectives using and , shifted stress allows one to differentiate these morphemes from lexical (common enough) and those &#x27;s that are part of lexical roots (also relatively common). itself will often lose stress and reduce to a tense vowel before other suffixes, leaving the shifting as a hint of its underlying presence.

Stress can also differentiate otherwise identical voice morpheme strings: causative reflexive (get someone else to do/make one) from (1) the causative of making oneself seem, or pretend to be in some state, and (2) the circumstantial ( allomorph before m-) of same (i.e. to seem/pretend at any specified time or place, with any particular tools, for any reasons, etc.). Circumstantial T has different allomorphs- some having following stressable vowel, others not- this also complicates matters for the learner but may also help disentangle morpheme boundaries for the listener.

===Sound symbolism===
There appears to be a great deal of remnant sound symbolism in the Yahgan lexicon. For example, many roots ending in -m encode as part of their senses the notion of a texturally softened positive curve (similar to -mp in such words as lump or hump in English), while an -l in similar position often shows up when the reference is to bloody core parts, often out from once safe confinement inside the body. Many roots with initial ch- refer to repeated, spiny extrusions, final -x to dry, hard-edged, or brittle parts, and so on.

The historical sources of these patterns cannot be known for sure, but it may be possible that there was at one time a shape and texture classifier system of some sort behind them. Such systems are rather common in South American languages.

There is little direct onomatopoeia recorded by Bridges, despite descriptions of highly animated imitative behavior on the part of speakers being recorded in the late 19th century. Several bird names are perhaps reduplications of calls (or other nonvocal behavior), and there are a couple of imitative cries and sound words. Most words denoting sounds end in an unproductive verb-deriving suffix (in at least one case , and r is known to alternate with sh), which may be derived from the Yahgan root &#x27;voice, language, uttered words, speech, cry&#x27;, or &#x27;to cry&#x27; — e.g. &#x27;to rattle&#x27;.

In the Bridges dictionary of the language one may note several otherwise identical terms differing only in whether they are spelled with an s or a ch — e.g. / &#x27;skin&#x27;. It is not known whether this was dialectal, dialect mixture, ideolectal, gender-based usage or a real grammatical variation such as might occur with augmentative/diminutive sound symbolic shifting.

== Alphabet ==
The alphabet currently sanctioned officially in Chile is as follows:

a, æ, ch, e, ö, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, rh, s, š, t, u, w, x.

A simplified orthography is a variant of the old Bridges system, created for online use on the Waata Chis discussion list on Yahoo Groups and elsewhere. It has tense and lax vowels as well as voiced and voiceless consonants. In the system, tenseness is marked by colon (:) following the vowel sign: a, a:, ai, au, e, e:, i, i:, iu:, o, o:, oi, u, u:, v (pronounced as a schwa, not ), all corresponding to unique graphemes in the Bridges orthography. The consonants are b, d, ch, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, ng, p, r, s, sh, t, w, x, y, z, all corresponding to unique Bridges graphemes. Some are found only in restricted environments. The phonemes hm, hn, hl, hr, hw, and hy are used as well, and are digraphs in the earlier Bridges writings, but single graphemes in later ones.

Still later, Bridges made further orthographic modifications: w, h, and y became superscripts, and à is read as ya, á as ha, and ā as wa. Superscripts could combine to give hw, hy, etc. Because iu: could now be represented by u: plus y- superscript (ù:), and because the original graphemes for u: and u were easily confused with each other as well as with the now-superscripted w, Bridges began using the now-redundant grapheme for iu: (approximately ų) for u: in his renderings. All of these changes took place in a very short time frame, and have led to substantial confusion on the part of later scholars.

In addition, Bridges&#x27; modifications of the 19th century phonetic alphabet of Alexander Ellis also included a number of signs meant for transliterations of foreign terms.

There are some ambiguities in Bridges&#x27; renderings. He himself notes that g/k, j/ch, d/t and p/f are, in many instances, interchangeable. In certain environments s and sh are hard to distinguish (as before high front vowels). The same goes for ai versus e: and au versus o:. Such ambiguities may go far to help explain the loss or lack of contrasts in the surviving dialect.

===Pronunciation===
==Grammar==
===Syntax===
Yahgan exhibits extensive case marking on nouns and equally extensive voice marking on verbs. Because of this, word order is relatively less important in determining subject and object relations. Most of the clauses in the three published biblical texts, the dictionary, and the various grammars show either verb medial or verb final orders. Certain clause types are verb initial, but are the distinct minority.

Further analysis of the biblical texts is showing that the Yahga dialect allowed for semantic reordering of constituents. For instance, if SVO is considered the default order for subject and object flanking the verb, then when O is left-shifted (SOV) there is often a sense that the object nominal has more say in his/her patient-hood than if kept to the right of the verb. Similarly, when the subject is right-shifted (VSO) its agent-hood appears often less than what one would expect. It will remain to be seen how pervasive this principle is in the language, and how intricately it interacts with Tense-Aspect-Mood and Polarity marking, topicalization, focus, etc.

The adverb &#x27;fast, quick(ly)&#x27; can be used lexically to modify predications, but in the three biblical texts it is also apparently used to mark the second component clause in &#x27;if-then&#x27; types of constructions. There is no mention made of this in surviving grammars, nor in the dictionary glosses of . The progressive verb suffix may be related.

===Grammaticalization===
Grammaticalization is a historical linguistic process whereby regular lexical items shift function (and sometimes form) and become part of the grammar structure.

An example of this in Yahgan would be the change of posture verbs into aspectual markers. Yahgan has a system of verbs which denote the posture of an entity: &#x27;stand&#x27; , &#x27;sit&#x27; , &#x27;lie&#x27; and others (for instance &#x27;fly/jump&#x27;, &#x27;float&#x27; etc.). In normal lexical usage one could say

: &#x27;I sat&#x27;. ( full pronoun first person singular, bound version unmarked for number, past tense).
: &#x27;You stood&#x27;. ( full pronoun second singular, bound).

But with the same root in their grammaticalized forms added:

: &#x27;I stood regularly, or as a rule&#x27;.
: &#x27;You often sat, or were ready to sit&#x27;.

The semantic bases of such usage seems to the degree of bodily contact with the substratum, vigilance, engagement, etc. Flying/jumping means ceasing some activity of interest entirely and going off to do something else rather suddenly, standing implies readiness to do something else as needed but attending to the activity when one can. Sitting is regular involvement in the activity, though not to the exclusion of other things that need doing. Lying (not just on but also within) is deep involvement, almost to the exclusion of other activities (English &#x27;immersed in&#x27;, being &#x27;wrapped up in&#x27;, &#x27;in a rut&#x27; &#x27;be up to one&#x27;s neck/ears in&#x27;, &#x27;in over one&#x27;s head&#x27;, &#x27;buried in (as work)&#x27; etc. have similar import). Relative height is another way to look at it- we say we are &#x27;over&#x27; with something to mean &#x27;done with&#x27; (equivalent to the jump/fly term in Yahgan), with a hint of relative dominance implied as well. While English has a plethora of colorful expressions for denoting such circumstances, Yahgan has reduced the system to a well-defined smallish set of terms from the domain of posture verbs. Such reduction is one symptom of grammaticalization.

Such contact/engagement-based semantic clines are relatively common cross-linguistically, and the phenomenon of posture verbs changing to aspect marking morphemes is well known among linguists, though it is not the only pathway to creating such terms.

A phonetically based cline (based on both oral articulatory position and manner) can be seen in prefixes in Yahgan, and combinations and .

* denotes an activity begun or intended, but not completed
* seems to imply continuation
* removal of impediments to the completion of the activity

Combined forms and appear to accentuate the continuous part of the activity.

In North America, languages of the Siouan and Chemakuan families have similarly structured basic systems (Siouan prefixal, Chemakuan suffixal), but mostly with spatial reference. is standing out, away from some surface, is surface contact, and is containment within a surface, though there are also processual and figure/ground senses involved. Note that standing away minimizes surface contact. Other language families have distance demonstratives which follow similar phonological clines. It is possible that there may be historical connections between the y- form and ki:pa &#x27;woman&#x27; and u:- and u:a &#x27;man&#x27;, which when verbalized apparently refer to less and more forceful or determined attempts to achieve respectively. Verbs &#x27;to intend, wish&#x27; and &#x27;pass, surpass&#x27;, as well as &#x27;do fiercely, forcibly&#x27; may be related, with suffixal on the first forms.

Horizontal movement verbs commonly change, cross-linguistically, into tense markers. Yahgan shows evidence of such shifts as well.

===Pronouns===
The three personal pronoun bases are: first person/proximal, second person/near distal, third person/further distal. These are also the forms found as bound prefixes on verbs.

Free/emphatic forms:

===Demonstratives===
The demonstrative bases are the same historically as those of the pronouns:
* &#x27;here&#x27;
* &#x27;this&#x27;
* &#x27;there (close)&#x27;
* &#x27;that (close)&#x27;
* &#x27;that (further away)&#x27;

===Adjectives===
Yahgan possesses a large number of adjective roots, especially those referring to physical states of matter, health, psychological states, etc. Many do double duty as nouns, adverbs, less often without derivation as verbs. Nouns and adjectives can be verbalized by adding &#x27;(be) in a state&#x27;, or &#x27;become&#x27; or both &#x27;develop into a state&#x27; (where the identity of V is influenced by the final vowel of the root, but is often not identical to it). Such verbalizations are exceedingly common in the dictionary, and can be further derived and inflected.

Adjectives in Yahgan generally have predicative value when following a noun, but are attributive when preceding. There are large numbers of adjective-noun compounds in the language. Examples of attributive adjectives preceding the noun:
* &#x27;a lying man, i.e. a liar&#x27;
* &#x27;a lying woman&#x27;
* &#x27;a young child&#x27;
* &#x27;a large canoe&#x27;

Examples of predicative adjectives following a noun:
* &#x27;tight-tongued i.e. tongue-tied&#x27;
* &#x27;weak-handed i.e. not dexterous&#x27;

Some more commonly used suffixal forms creating adjectives are:
* &#x27;wishing, wanting to X&#x27;
* &#x27;having no ability to resist X&#x27;ing&#x27;
* &#x27;disposed towards X(ing)&#x27;
* &#x27;having difficulty Xing or unable to X&#x27;
* &#x27;troubled doing X&#x27;
* &#x27;tired of X or Xing&#x27;
* &#x27;doing X well&#x27;

Examples:
* &#x27;liking to pray&#x27;
* &#x27;tired of explaining&#x27;
* &#x27;good at writing&#x27;

As with other adjective roots, these suffixed forms may be further derived as in the lvmbi example above.

===Adverbs===
Adverbs are the one-word class that appears to allow for productive reduplication.

===Nouns===
The physical environment in which the Yahgan people lived was relatively poor in land resources, and historically they spent little time in the interior. It is understandable, then, that the vocabulary reflects this. There are many fewer names for land animals and plants than one might expect based on what is found in other languages from other, richer natural environments. The sea coast was a different matter, and the language had many terms for sea birds and ocean life.

Yahgan emphasized interconnected parts over unanalyzed wholes (also reflected in their verb serialization). Body parts are finely differentiated, as are social relationships. The vocabulary contained a vast number of deverbalized nouns.

Personal names often derived from the name of the place of birth- for instance, a man born in Ushuaia (meaning &#x27;bay () in the upper back ()&#x27;) might be . Alternatively one might use the case form &#x27;from&#x27; and &#x27;man&#x27; giving .

Subject nouns take no overt case marking (subject coreference is on the verb instead). Nouns can be marked for accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and other cases. Geographical information can be incorporated into the string, as can information about number, collectivity, definiteness, etc. Most of these marks are suffixal.

In the three biblical texts there are numerous complex noun phrases with very involved case relations. It is unknown whether this is characteristic of speaker usage or an invention of the missionary Bridges.

Verbs can be nominalized through a variety of means, particularly by the prefixation of circumstantial T (with its various allomorphs) and/or suffixation of participial morphemes:
* &#x27;past participle&#x27;
* &#x27;present participle&#x27;
* &#x27;future participle&#x27;.

Examples:
* &#x27;to give at some particular time, in some stated place, using some tool&#x27;, or &#x27;a gift&#x27;
* &#x27;when X saw, or the one who saw&#x27;
* &#x27;The boy who lived&#x27;
* &#x27;the one who will die&#x27;

===Verbs===
Verbs in Yahgan are often compounded (&quot;serialized&quot;). Bound subject pronouns ( 1st, 2nd, 3rd), unmarked for number, are prefixed, coming before voice prefixes (such as passive, causative, permissive, circumstantial (with allomorphs , , , , , , ), back, in response to, etc.). Aspect (such as progressive ), tense (for instance simple past, simple future, with added increments &#x27;further past&#x27;, &#x27;further future), and mood (generally in that order), etc. are suffixal, along with the two &#x27;benefactive&#x27; suffixes &#x27;for self&#x27;, &#x27;for another&#x27;. Number within the verb (number of subjects or acts) can be encoded by overt marking (once -, twice -/, several times , plural /, or even none ) or the many different distinct plural verbs (for instance &#x27;sg. to stand&#x27;, &#x27;pl. to stand&#x27;; &#x27;sg. to take, convey&#x27;, &#x27;pl. to take, convey&#x27;).

Ex. &#x27;We () were making them () take ( &lt; &#x27;take&#x27;) the boat () during ( circumstantial plus locative on) the winter () a while ago&#x27;.

A handful of verbs form doublets where one of the pair seems to have an unproductive reversative suffix possibly related to the form &#x27;(do) for oneself&#x27;. For instance &#x27;to lend&#x27;, &#x27;to borrow&#x27;.

In addition to normal serialization Yahgan also exhibits complex verb stems of a type relatively common in western North America, where the main verb is flanked by instrument/body part manner of action prefixes and pathway/position suffixes. The prefixes are part of a larger, more open system of elements marking various kinds of causes or motivations, grading off into more grammaticalized voice marking. Many of the path/position suffixes (especially posture verbs) do double duty as sources for more grammaticalized aspectual morphology. Tense suffixes seem to derive historically from horizontal motion verbs, and together with the more vertical postural aspect forms, make an interesting Cartesian-style coordinate system for dealing with the temporal dimension.


A small number of commonly used verb roots have irregular present tenses. Instead of dropping the final vowel (triggering reductive processes) these forms instead add after the vowel is dropped. Examples: &#x27;to sit&#x27;/&#x27;to be&#x27;, present (from ), &#x27;to lie&#x27;/&#x27;to be&#x27;, present , &#x27;to float&#x27;/&#x27;to be&#x27;, present . In the last example note that this seemingly suppletive present may in fact hark back to the original historical form, and infinitival may be the changed one.

The form &#x27;to hear&#x27; has grammaticalized into an evidential suffix &#x27;hearsay&#x27;. Ex. &#x27;They say that in this land many men died&#x27;. There are several other evidential suffixes, differentiating sensory mode (hearing, sight, etc.) as well as time. also finds modal use in the clitic space that often follows the first substantive in the sentence: &#x27;He MUST be alive, because they (the ones who told me about it) saw him today&#x27;. There are other modal verbs also found in this space.

There is little or no reduplication evident on the Yahgan verb, and sound symbolism of the augmentative/diminutive type appears to be largely lexicalized. On the other hand, Yahgan exhibits a good deal of remnant sound symbolism in the verb, similar to what one sees in English.

A good number of verbs seem to form small &#x27;word families&#x27; which have slight semantic differences which may have been encoded using sound symbolism (as one often sees, for instance, in some languages of the Austroasiatic stock). For instance &#x27;go, walk lightly&#x27; versus &#x27;walk heavily, plod&#x27;. In such cases the original symmetry of form seems often to have been distorted by historical changes.

<text>Thomas Tannatt Pryce VC MC &amp; Bar (17 January 1886 – 13 April 1918) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. An officer with the Grenadier Guards during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions over the period 11 to 13 April 1918, during the German spring offensive.

==Early life==
Thomas Tannatt Pryce was born at The Hague, the youngest child of four to Thomas and Rosalie Pryce, of Pentreheylin Hall, Montgomeryshire, in Wales. His father was a landowner and merchant, with business ties to London, The Hague, and the Dutch East Indies. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and then had two terms at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester before leaving to travel overseas.

By 1913, Pryce was a member of the London Stock Exchange, working at Henry Tudor &amp; Son. He had married the previous year; his wife was Margaret Fordham, the daughter of a magistrate. The couple had three daughters.

==First World War==
Within a few weeks of the outbreak of the First World War, Pryce enlisted in the Honourable Artillery Company as a private. The unit duly embarked for France in late August. The following month, he had been promoted to lance corporal. In October 1915, having received a commission, he transferred to the 1/6th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, then serving on the Western Front as part of the 48th Division. With the battalion, he was involved in fighting at Gommecourt in late November 1915; he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for leading an assault on German trenches. The initial attack was successful but when German reinforcements arrived, Pryce executed a safe withdrawal of his men. Wounded in this action, he was evacuated to England for treatment.

Pryce returned to the frontlines in May 1916 and soon afterwards, was awarded a bar to his MC for leading a platoon in an attack at Fauquissart. In September 1916, he transferred to the 4th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards and was promoted to lieutenant. He was mentioned in despatches on 7 April 1918 for his services in the field and three days later was promoted to acting captain.

The German spring offensive had been underway since 21 March 1918, with the British frontlines coming under severe pressure. Pryce&#x27;s battalion, as part of the 31st Division, had been in reserve, but was brought back to the front on 10 April to hold the line at the village of Le Paradis, near Vieux-Berquin. As commander of a company, he was tasked with the capture and subsequent defence of a village. After seizing the village, he was left with around 40 men and over the next two days fended off attacks by the Germans. At one stage, his position was under direct bombardment from field guns. His force depleted, he was killed making a last-ditch bayonet charge. For his actions, he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Pryce&#x27;s VC read: 
He was also mentioned in despatches posthumously, on 22 May 1918. Pryce&#x27;s name is recorded on the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing in Berks Cemetery Extension near Ploegsteert in Hainaut, Belgium. He has no known grave.

==Victoria Cross==

King George V presented Pryce&#x27;s VC to his widow on 12 April 1919, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. In addition to the VC and the MC with its bar, he was also entitled to the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal with oak leaf device. His medals are on loan to The Guards Museum, located at Wellington Barracks in London.

Pryce is associated with several memorials; he is listed on the Maidenhead War Memorial in Berkshire, memorial plaques at Shrewsbury School and Mill Mead School. The latter as moved to St Giles&#x27; Church, Shrewsbury, following the closure of Mill Mead school in 1966. He is also remembered at the Stock Exchange Memorial, Llandysilio Church, and the War Memorial at Four Crosses, in the Llandysilio parish.

<text>Lance Sergeant John Harold Rhodes VC DCM &amp; Bar (17 May 1891 – 27 November 1917) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Rhodes was born on 17 May 1891 in England in Packmoor, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, the son of an ex-soldier and miner, Ernie Rhodes. He was educated in Newchapel and later became a miner at the Chatterley Whitfield Colliery. Around 1910, however, he joined the Grenadier Guards of the British Army and served for three years, after which he returned to the colliery.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, John was recalled to the forces as a reservist. Now 26 years old, and a Lance-Sergeant in the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, British Army during the First World War John won the Distinguished Conduct Medal on 17 May 1915 and three months later was awarded a bar to this medal. While back in England recovering from his wounds, John married Lizzie but was not destined to live to see their son, John Rhodes (who, as an artilleryman, was himself awarded the Oak Leaves for gallantry in Northwestern Europe in 1944),

Back on the front-line, the following deed took place at the Battle of Poelcapelle for which John was awarded the VC and also the Croix De Guerre:
He was killed in action at Fontaine-Notre-Dame, France on 27 November 1917 and buried at Rocquigny-Equancourt Road British Cemetery, Manancourt.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Grenadier Guards RHQ) in Wellington Barracks, London, England.

A memorial plaque was unveiled at Chatterley Whitfield Mining Museum on 20 April 1984. There is also a road named in honour of John at nearby Tunstall. There is a memorial in Packmoor village on the Millennium Green outside Packmoor School which was unveiled in 2000.

<doc id="1179157" wikidata="Q3570545" url="?curid=1179157" title="Xan Fielding">
<text>Alexander Wallace Fielding (26 November 1918 – 19 August 1991), known as Xan Fielding, was a British author, translator, journalist and traveller, who served as a Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent in Crete, France and East Asia during World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe and Asia against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Fielding was born in Ootacamund, India, where his father, Alexander James Lumsden Wallace, served in the Indian Army, as a major in the 52nd Sikhs (Frontier Force). Fielding&#x27;s mother Mary Gertrude (née Feilmann) died soon after his birth, on 13 December 1918, and he was largely brought up in Nice, France, by his maternal grandparents who adopted the name Fielding. For the first eight years of his life, he thought his grandparents were his parents and his seven aunts and uncles were his older siblings. He was educated at Charterhouse School and then studied briefly at the Universities of Bonn, Munich and Freiburg in Germany. In the late 1930s, Fielding moved to Cyprus, where he worked as a sub-editor on &quot;The Cyprus Times&quot; and ran a bar.

The actress Vivien Leigh was his first cousin once removed, as her mother Gertrude was the youngest sister of Fielding&#x27;s maternal grandmother. The actor Gerald Fielding was his uncle and took care of him after the death of his grandparents.

===Crete===
Following the fall of France, Fielding joined the British Army, and was commissioned into the Cyprus Regiment as a second lieutenant on 1 September 1940. After the fall of Crete in May 1941, he joined the Special Operations Executive, and was eventually landed in Crete with a supply of weapons and explosives by the submarine , under Commander Anthony Miers. Fielding teamed up with Patrick Leigh Fermor, and built an intelligence gathering network which provided detailed information on the movement of Axis troops, shipping, and air transport.

He arranged for the transportation to Egypt of hundreds of Allied soldiers left behind after the evacuation, and now being hidden by the Cretans. After six months Fielding returned to Cairo, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 15 October 1942.

Fielding finally returned to Crete with Arthur Reade in November 1942. In November 1943 he successfully concluded a pact between the two rival groups of andartes, the communist-led EAM-ELAS and the EOK, the national organisation of Crete. He was then relieved by Dennis Ciclitira. In Cairo, he became a member of the Tara household created by Bill Stanley Moss.

===France===
In early 1944 Fielding volunteered to join the French section of SOE, and was parachuted into the south of France in mid-1944, where he was met by two other SOE agents: Francis Cammaerts (codename &quot;Roger&quot;) and Christine Granville (codename &quot;Pauline&quot;) of the &quot;Jockey&quot; network. 

On 13 August 1944, two days before the Allied landings in southern France, Fielding, Cammaerts and French agent Christian Sorensen were stopped at a roadblock near Digne. An irregularity in Fielding&#x27;s papers, plus the large amount of cash he and Cammaerts were carrying, aroused suspicion and they were arrested. Granville soon arrived at Digne prison posing as Cammaerts&#x27; wife and, using a mixture of bribery and threats, persuaded the Germans to release them. As a result, the men were led out of prison expecting to be shot, and were astonished to be met by Granville, waiting for them with a car.

===Post-war===
Before the war in Europe ended Fielding briefly returned to Crete; he was one of the first Allied officers to enter liberated Athens. He served in the Far East for a few months until the end of the war, and visited Tibet. He then spent six months in Germany serving with the Special Intelligence Service, before serving as a United Nations observer in the Balkans in 1946.

In 1948 he met Daphne Thynne, the wife of Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath. After her divorce, they were married in 1953 and lived in Cornwall, Morocco, Portugal and Uzès.

In 1956 Fielding was hired by Michael Powell to act as technical adviser for the filming of Bill Stanley Moss&#x27;s book &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; – the story of Leigh Fermor&#x27;s and Moss&#x27;s abduction of General Kreipe, the German commander in Crete. He wrote a number of books; including &quot;The Stronghold&quot;, an account of SOE&#x27;s Cretan operations, and a memoir of his own wartime experiences &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; (which he dedicated to Christine Granville). In 2014 Folio republished &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; with an introduction by Granville&#x27;s biographer Clare Mulley.
He provided the English translations for many of the works of the French novelist Pierre Boulle, including his best-known books &quot;Le Pont de la rivière Kwaï&quot; (&quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot;) and &quot;La Planète des singes&quot; (&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;). He translated several books by Jean Lartéguy, as well as works by Gabriel Chevallier, Pierre Schoendoerffer and Jean Hougron. Fielding also collaborated with Patrick Leigh Fermor in a translation from Greek of George Psychoundakis&#x27; book &quot;The Cretan Runner&quot;

His marriage to Lady Daphne was dissolved in 1978. He remarried, to Agnes, daughter of Admiral John H. Magruder of the U.S. Navy and the widow of the artist Arshile Gorky.

===Death===
Xan Fielding died in Paris on 19 August 1991, aged 72.

<text>This is the family tree for monarchs of England (and Wales after 1282) from Alfred the Great to Elizabeth I of England. The House of Wessex family tree precedes this family tree and the family tree of the British royal family follows it.

As to the medieval histories of Scotland and Wales:
*The family tree of Scottish monarchs covers the same period in Scotland and, equally as shown, directly precedes the family tree of the British royal family.
*The family tree of Welsh monarchs is relevant before the 1282 conquest by England.

For a simplified family tree see family tree of British monarchs (and &quot;alternative successions of the English and British crown&quot; for unsuccessful claimants&#x27; family trees).

<doc id="1179159" wikidata="Q2960166" url="?curid=1179159" title="Sir Charles Russell, 3rd Baronet">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Charles Russell, 3rd Baronet VC (22 June 1826 – 13 April 1883), was a British Conservative politician and soldier. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Russell was the second but eldest surviving son of Sir Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet, British Resident at the court of Hyderabad in India, and his second wife, Marie Clotilde daughter of Benoît Mottet de La Fontaine, Baron Fieffé de St Corneille. 

He was educated at Eton College and entered the Grenadier Guards in 1847. Charles inherited the baronetcy and the family estate of Swallowfield Park in Berkshire in 1852. 

==Career==
He became a lieutenant and a captain the following year and accompanied his regiment to the Crimea where he took part in the Siege of Sebastopol and the Battles of Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman. He was a 28-year-old Brevet Major in the 3rd Battalion in the latter battle when the following action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 5 November 1854, Brevet Major Russell offered to dislodge a party of Russians from the Sandbag Battery if anyone would follow him. A sergeant and privates, Anthony Palmer and another who was subsequently killed – were the first to volunteer. The party met much resistance and several times seemed to be on the point of annihilation but their skill, especially with the bayonet, finally brought success. Major Russell himself fought with great valour and in single combat wrenched the rifle out of the grasp of a powerful Russian. His citation read:
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Grenadier Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London, England. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

===Politics===
He was involved in politics and sat as Conservative as Member of Parliament for Berkshire from 1865 to 1868 and for Westminster from 1874 to 1883. Lord Salisbury as Foreign Secretary (at which he served four times, and thrice was Prime Minister) appointed Sir Charles as Chairman of the Peruvian Bondholders Committee. Its aim was to &quot;stop Peru from contracting a fresh loan to buy munitions&quot;. More broadly the Europeans wished to delay US Navy assistance to Peru, which had already been defeated by the Chileans. Both Britain and France had large investments to protect: the rise of Peruvian bond stock, they contended was due to debt and military defeats. Britain refused to become embroiled; whereas the United States was spoiling for an international war. They secretly lobbied at Santiago against Russell and British interests to create a crisis. The Chileans &quot;received with acclamation&quot; in the City of London, assigning profits of Tarapaca mines and the nitrate-rich Guano Islands to the indebted bondholders. On this basis, Russell welcomed Chile&#x27;s conquest of southern Peru. The Americans responded, to the alarm of the Foreign Office and Admiralty, by leasing the Peruvian port of Chimbote as a Naval base. Russell was more concerned with the financial implications for City investors. Wary of the risks of a proxy war, the bondholders urged Parliament to recognise General Yglesias, the new Peruvian leader. The Americans stubbornly refused to grant the new government of 1884 recognition of its international status, even after the Treaty of Ancon had ceased hostilities.

==Personal life==
He died unmarried on 13 April 1883 and was buried in the family vault beneath his family&#x27;s transept (built in 1832) in the Church of England church of Swallowfield, Berkshire. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother, George.

<text>The &quot;Eunice Kennedy Shriver&quot; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States Department of Health and Human Services. It supports and conducts research aimed at improving the health of children, adults, families, and communities, including:
*Reducing infant deaths
*Promoting healthy pregnancy and childbirth
*Investigating growth and human development
*Examining problems of birth defects and intellectual and developmental disabilities
*Understanding reproductive health
*Enhancing function across the lifespan through rehabilitation research

==History==
The impetus for NICHD came from the Task Force on the Health and Well-Being of Children, convened in 1961 and led by Dr. Robert E. Cooke, a senior medical advisor to President John F. Kennedy. Eunice Kennedy Shriver also served on the task force, which reported that more research was needed on the physical, emotional, and intellectual growth of children.

The U.S. Congress established NICHD in 1962 as the first NIH institute to focus on the entire life process rather than on a specific disease or body system. NICHD became a funding source for research on birth defects and intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs), created a new pediatrics specialty, and established IDDs as a field of research. The institute also focused on the idea that adult health has its origins in early development and that behavior and social science were important aspects of human development.

On December 21, 2007, by act of Congress (Public Law 110–54), NICHD was renamed the &quot;Eunice Kennedy Shriver&quot; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in honor of Mrs. Shriver&#x27;s vision, dedication, and contributions to the founding of the institute.

==Past directors==
Past directors from 1963–present:

==Mission==
The mission of NICHD is to ensure that every person is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability, and to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.

==Operation==
As of November 2016, the director of NICHD is Diana W. Bianchi.

NICHD&#x27;s budget in 2015 was an estimated $1.3 billion, which supported research at institutions, universities, and organizations throughout the world, as well as research conducted by NICHD scientists on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD, and at other facilities.

==National Children&#x27;s Study==
The National Children&#x27;s Study (NCS) was a longitudinal cohort study that planned to recruit participants from across the United States of America. The NCS was led by the National Institutes of Health, with the NICHD serving as the scientific lead. It was intended to measure the many factors that contribute to health and disease from before birth through age 21. This included, but was not limited to, the search for drivers of diseases with prenatal or developmental origins. The Study was closed in December 2014.

===Organization===
Within NICHD, the NCS Program Office administered the implementation of day-to-day Study operations. The Program Office was supervised by the Study Director, Steven Hirschfeld, MD, PhD Associate Director for Clinical Research, NICHD.

For advice and recommendations regarding Study framework, content, and methodologies, the NCS Program Office engaged external advisors and scientific groups. These groups included federal partners such as the NCS Federal Advisory Committee and a Federal Consortium with representatives from multiple federal agencies including: the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An independent Study Monitoring and Oversight Committee monitored study progress and participant safety.

In addition to these more formal channels, the NCS solicited feedback from subject matter experts from around the world and from individuals, community advocates, and professional societies concerned with child health. The NCS Program Office also provided public forums for input on a variety of initiatives.

===Congressional Mandate===
The &quot;President&#x27;s Task Force on Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children&quot; recommended this federal initiative in 1999, after which Congress passed the Children&#x27;s Health Act of 2000 (Title X, Section 1004). The Act charged NICHD to:

# plan, develop, and implement a prospective cohort study, from birth to adulthood, to evaluate the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development; and
# investigate basic mechanisms of developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk and protective, that influence health and developmental processes.

The Act required this NCS to:
# incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences on children&#x27;s well-being;
# gather data on environmental influences and outcomes on diverse populations of children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures; and
# consider health disparities among children, which may include the consideration of prenatal exposures

===Objective===
The NCS was designed to examine the effects of the environment—broadly defined to include factors such as air, water, diet, sound, family dynamics, community, and cultural influences— and genetics on the growth, development, and health of children across the United States. The NCS was designed to follow approximately 100,000 children, some from before birth, through age 21 years. The NCS planned to collect comprehensive information to:
# contribute to improving the health and well-being of all children
# deepen our understanding of the contribution of various factors to a range of health and disease outcomes
# understand factors that lead to health disparities.

With this broad perspective, the NCS was designed to contribute to the implementation of health equity, where each individual has an opportunity to realize their health potential.

===Discontinued===
The NCS was in its Vanguard, or pilot phase, which was designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and utility of Study scientific output, logistics, and operations prior to initiating the Main Study. The Vanguard Study enrolled about 5,000 children in 40 counties across the United States. General recruitment was completed in July 2013.

On December 12, 2014, the National Children&#x27;s Study closed, after an expert review committee advised the NIH Director that moving forward with the larger Main Study would not be the best way to add to the understanding of how environmental and genetic factors influence child health and development.

==Notable accomplishments==
NICHD has made numerous contributions to improving the health of children, adults, families, and communities. Selected research advances from 2015 include improving the health of infants born preterm, encouraging healthy behaviors, and optimizing rehabilitation.

<text>Edward Colquhoun Charlton VC (15 June 1920 – 21 April 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Charlton was a guardsman in the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, Guards Armoured Division, British Army during the Second World War. On 21 April 1945 Guardsman Charlton was a co-driver of one tank of a troop that was supporting an infantry platoon. They occupied the village of Wistedt, Germany, which a unit from Panzergrenadier Regiment 115, part of the 15th Panzergrenadier Division, attempted to re-take. The numerically superior German forces consisted largely of officer cadets under the command of experienced instructor officers, supported by two or three self-propelled guns.

Three of the four Irish Guards tanks were badly hit, while Charlton&#x27;s had already been disabled by a complete electrical failure before the attack began. Charlton was ordered to dismount the turret 0.30 Browning machine gun and support the infantry. The Irish Guards were in danger of being overrun. Charlton, on his own initiative, took the machine gun and advanced in full view of the attacking Germans, firing from the hip and inflicting heavy casualties. The lead German company was halted, which gave the rest of the Guards a respite in which to reorganise and retire. He continued firing, even when he was wounded in his left arm. Charlton placed the machine gun on a fence, where he launched a further attack, before his left arm was hit again, becoming shattered and useless. Charlton fought on, until a further wound and loss of blood resulted in the guardsman collapsing. His stand enabled the rest of the Irish Guards troop and infantry to escape. He later died of the wounds in enemy hands.

Charlton was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the last Victoria Cross of the European theatre, and the last awarded to a member of the Irish Guards. Unusually, much of the citation was based on German accounts of the fight, as most of his later actions had not been witnessed by any of the Guards officers or surviving non-commissioned officers. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Irish Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London, England.

A road is named after Charlton in Firswood, Greater Manchester, near where he lived.

<text>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) conducts research into the effects of the environment on human disease, as one of the 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is located in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, and is the only primary division of the NIH located outside of the Washington metropolitan area.

As an institute of the National Institutes of Health, the NIEHS supports environmental health research with the mission of reducing environmental disease, advancing basic, environmental health and clinical science, and increasing the availability of researcher and worker training.

==Constitution==
The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is a part of the National Institutes of Health, which is in turn a part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The mission of the NIEHS is to &quot;reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease&quot;. NIEHS focuses on peer-reviewed basic science, disease-oriented research, global environmental health, clinical research, and multidisciplinary training for researchers.

NIEHS researchers and grantees have shown links between lung cancer and asbestos exposure, the developmental impairment of children exposed to lead and the health effects of urban pollution. The 1994 co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in medicine, Dr. Martin Rodbell, served as Scientific Director of the NIEHS from 1985 to 1989. Later on in 1994, NIEHS scientists assisted in identifying the first breast cancer gene, BRCA1, and, in 1995, identified a gene that suppresses prostate cancer. Work by NIEHS researchers and grantees has resulted in the development of genetically altered mice to improve and shorten the screening of potential toxins and to help develop aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drugs with fewer side effects.

The Institute funds centers for environmental health studies at universities across the United States.

== History ==

In 1966, U.S. Surgeon General William H. Stewart helped to create a Division of Environmental Health Sciences within the NIH. Three years later, the division became its own institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Past directors include Paul Kotin, David Rall, Kenneth Olden, David A. Schwartz, and Linda Birnbaum.

== Directors ==
== Organization ==
The NIEHS is one of 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). NIEHS is located on in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. Its current director is Dr. Richard Woychik, who is also concurrently the director of the National Toxicology Program. The deputy director is Dr. Trevor Archer. The director of the NIEHS reports to the director of the NIH, of which the NIEHS is a member agency.

NIEHS is composed of:
* Division of Intramural Research (DIR), which is research done at NIEHS
* Division of Extramural Research and Training, which funds research conducted elsewhere
* Division of the National Toxicology Program, which is an interagency program headquartered at NIEHS

<text>Before the TOPS Class 97 was issued to self-propelled locomotives in departmental (non-revenue earning) use, British Rail had such locomotives numbered in a variety of series, together with locomotives that were no longer self-propelled.

==Southern Region series==
SR departmental locomotives are the locomotives of departmental (non-revenue earning) stock originally introduced by the Southern Railway. Both departmental locomotives and carriages were numbered in a series commencing at 1S. The series was retained by the Southern Region of British Rail, but amended so that the numbers carried a &#x27;DS&#x27; prefix instead of an &#x27;S&#x27; suffix. 

This page lists the locomotives numbered in this series, including steam, diesel and electric locomotives.

==Eastern Region series==
In 1952, the Eastern Region of British Railways introduced its own series for departmental (non-revenue earning) vehicles, including locomotives. Numbers were allocated from 1 to 1000, with blocks of 100 numbers allocated to specific types of vehicle. This page only lists the locomotives (steam, diesel and electric), which took the number 1 to 100. This block was split as follows:
*1-30 : Great Northern section (maintained at Doncaster)
*31-50 : Great Eastern section (maintained at Stratford)
*51-100: North Eastern section (maintained at Darlington)

The Great Northern list later expanded to take numbers 31 and 32 from the Great Eastern list. Also included on this page is a former diesel locomotive that had been converted as a mobile power unit and numbered in the 9xx block used for miscellaneous vehicles.

===Great Northern section===
===Great Eastern section===
===North Eastern section===
===Miscellaneous stock===
==Western Region series==
The Great Western Railway purchased two diesel shunters during its existence, which were numbered 1 and 2. Number 1 was effectively a departmental locomotive, while 2 was in capital stock. Details of both locomotives may be found here.

The GWR also owned a number of small petrol shunters built by Motor Rail, which carried numbers 15 and 22-27 in their departmental number series. These survived to be taken over by British Rail, which did not renumber them. These shunters are listed below.

The Western Region of British Rail used a PWM (Permanent Way Machinery) series which incorporated some locomotives. The two narrow gauge GWR petrol shunters were allocated numbers in this series, as were the five shunters PWM650-PWM654, which were later renumbered as 97650-97654.

==Engineering Department series==
The London Midland Region Engineering Department numbered its diesel locomotives in a series running from ED1 upwards (though ED8 and ED9 were never allocated).

==966xxx and 968xxx series==
The 968xxx series (in the carriage and wagon number series) was used for departmental locomotives from 1968 onwards. Previously, some former Class 08 shunters that were converted to snowploughs had been numbered in the 966xxx series, but this was discontinued and some of these locomotives were renumbered into the 968xxx series.

When the Class 97 series for self-propelled locomotives was introduced, some locomotives in this series were renumbered to Class 97, leaving the 968xxx numbers just for locomotives that were no longer self-propelled. Since privatisation, other numbering schemes have been used for locomotives used for a similar-purpose as those in the 968xxx series. For completion these locomotives are also included. Details of all locomotives are shown below:

==Internal User series==
Internal User vehicles are those that are not allowed to run on the mainline, but are only for use within depot complexes. They are often stationary, though not always. Two former locomotives that were heavily stripped, leaving just the frames, to carry power units within Toton depot were allocated IU numbers.

==Miscellaneous locomotives==
Brush Traction, Loughborough were using a British Rail Class 56 locomotive, 56009 in their works as a power unit transporter and test bed for a Class 56 overhaul programme. It was not registered on the TOPS system, but Brush had given it the painted TOPS-like number 56201. This programme was abandoned, leaving the loco in extended storage for over 16 years. It since been sold to UKRL leasing and remains stored at Shackerstone with plans to overhaul it as part of their re-engineering programme.

A heavily stripped Class 73 locomotive, 73126 was used as a static training locomotive at the Fire Service College in Moreton-in-Marsh, replacing the previously used locomotives TDB 968030 (33018, preserved and now under restoration at a private site near Mangapps Farm in Essex) and ADB 968034 (08769, preserved at Severn Valley Railway). Since this locomotive was converted after privatisation it was not renumbered into the 968xxx series. Bought by Cotswold Rail&#x27;s Adrian Parcell and later sold to the college, the locomotive was little more than a shell after 4 years as a spares donor at Stewart&#x27;s Lane and Old Oak Common, and after 9 years was sold for scrap at Booth Roe Metals, Rotherham in August 2009.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel James Neville Marshall VC, MC &amp; Bar (12 June 1887 – 4 November 1918), was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Marshall was born in Manchester in June 1887. His family moved to Oxford Road, Acocks Green, Birmingham in around 1894, his father being a draper. James Neville went to King Edwards School and after leaving worked at the Birmingham and Midland Institute and in the Medical Faculty of the University of Birmingham in a clerical capacity. He studied veterinary practice, then worked in this field in Harlow, Essex. Marshall married Edith Maud Taylor, daughter of successful maltster Mr. Henry Algernon Taylor on 20 September 1911. He started off the First World War in Argentina, buying horses but then enlisted in the Irish Guards. 

He was 31 years old, and an acting lieutenant colonel in the Irish Guards, British Army, attached to the Lancashire Fusiliers, commanding 16th Battalion during the First World War at the battle of Sambre when the events took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 November 1918 at the Sambre–Oise Canal, near Catillon, France, when a partly constructed bridge was badly damaged before the advanced troops of his battalion could cross, Marshall organised repair parties. The first party were soon killed or wounded, but the colonel&#x27;s personal example was such that more volunteers were instantly forthcoming. Under intense fire and with complete disregard of his own safety, he stood on the bank encouraging his men and helping in the work. When the bridge was repaired he attempted to lead his men across, but was killed in the attack. Wilfred Owen was killed in the same engagement soon after the bridge was crossed as he encouraged his men. 

He was also awarded the Croix de Guerre (Belgium) and was made a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold (Belgium). His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Irish Guards RHQ), London, England.

Marshall is commemorated at Harlow War Memorial Institute and on their website.

Marshall is also commemorated in the Old Harlow Baptist Church, St Mary&#x27;s (Churchgate Street) and St Mary-at-Latton churches on their memorials to the fallen of Harlow.

James Marshall is also mentioned several times in Pat Barker&#x27;s Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;The Ghost Road&quot;, in which he is referred to as &#x27;Colonel Marshall-of-the-Ten-Wounds&#x27;.

On 12/13 September 1917 north of Broenbeek, Belgium, Lance-Sergeant Moyney was in command of 15 men forming two advanced posts. Surrounded by the enemy he held his post for 96 hours, having no water and very little food. On the fifth day, on the enemy advancing to dislodge him, he attacked them with bombs, while also using his Lewis gun with great effect. Finding himself surrounded, he led his men in a charge through the enemy and reached a stream, where he and a private (Thomas Woodcock) covered his party while they crossed unscathed, before crossing themselves under a shower of bullets.

Moyney later achieved the rank of sergeant. He died in Roscrea, County Tipperary on 10 November 1980. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Guards Regimental Headquarters (Irish Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London.



On 12 September 2017 a memorial was unveiled on Mill Road, Rathdowney.

<text>George Arthur Boyd-Rochfort VC (1 January 1880 – 7 August 1940) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

Boyd-Rochfort was born on 1 January 1880, the eldest son of Major Rochfort Hamilton Boyd-Rochfort, and the grandson of George Augustus Boyd-Rochfort, both of Middleton Park House, County Westmeath, Ireland.

He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was whip of the Trinity Foot Beagles.

He married Olivia Ellis Ussher, daughter of Christopher Ussher, of Eastwell, Loughrea, Co. Galway, at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Dublin in 1901.

In 1904, he was High Sheriff of Westmeath.

==Military career==

Boyd-Rochfort was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Scots Guards in April 1915.

He was 35 years old, and a second lieutenant in the Scots Guards, British Army, (Special Reserve, attached to 1st Battalion) during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

At 2 a.m. on 3 August 1915 in the trenches between Cambrin and La Bassée, France, a German trench-mortar bomb landed on the side of the parapet of the communication trench in which Second Lieutenant Boyd-Rochfort was standing, close to a small working party of his battalion. Instead of stepping back into safety he shouted to his men to look out, rushed at the bomb, seized it and hurled it over the parapet where it at once exploded. This combination of presence of mind and courage saved the lives of many of the working party.

A description of the incident in Boyd-Rochfort&#x27;s own words:
Later Boyd-Rochfort was wounded in a single-handed fight with two Germans; he knocked one down with the butt-end of his empty revolver and the other with his fist. He was invalided home. 

Boyd-Rochfort relinquished his commission in 1920 with the rank of captain.

==Later life==
Boyd-Rochfort was a noted jockey and polo-player. After the war he became well known in Irish racing circles as an owner and breeder, and as senior steward of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee and a member of the Irish Turf Club. Boswell, the winner of the St Leger in 1936, and Precipitation, winner of the Ascot Gold Cup in 1937, were bred and reared at his stud at Middleton Park. His brother Cecil Boyd-Rochfort was a noted racehorse trainer.

He died at Dublin on 7 August 1940.

==Grave==
He was buried in the Church of Ireland graveyard in Castletown Geoghegan, County Westmeath. His memorial was rededicated after refurbishment on 3 August 2015.

==Medals==
His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Scots Guards RHQ) in Wellington Barracks, London.

<doc id="1179182" wikidata="Q4413656" url="?curid=1179182" title="Finlux">
<text>Finlux is a Finnish brand of consumer electronics, established in Lohja, Finland, in 1971, originally part of the &quot;Oy Lohja AB&quot; industrial group. Finlux televisions are second most sold TV brand in Finland. It has been owned by the Turkish electronics company Vestel since 2006.

== History ==

The origins of Finlux were in the Iskumetalli Oy company in Lohja, producer of industrial pumps, that in 1948 started to produce tube radio receivers under license from the Swedish company Luxor and in 1958 the first television receivers. In 1964, Iskumetalli was incorporated in the Lohja industrial group, and in 1971, the Luxor license agreement expired and was officially introduced the Finlux brand, which was a blend word of &quot;Finlandia&quot; and &quot;Luxor&quot;; this was the first time that Finlux had been used as a company name.
In 1972, Finlux unveiled his first colour TV set, called Finlux &quot;Peacock&quot;, developed by engineer Martti Ahava, which in 1974 was joined by the &quot;Colibri&quot; model.

In 1977, alongside the consumer electronics division, Lohja started manufacturing Electroluminescence (EL) displays after purchasing the development project, headed by Dr. Tuomo Suntola. The EL displays were manufactured using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process developed in the project, and were marketed also with the Finlux brand.

In 1978, Finlux introduced the &quot;Finlux OBC&quot; (&quot;Optimum Brightness Contrast&quot;) line of colour TVs, developed by engineer Heikki Tupala, which was one of the most successful products of the Finnish company.

In 1979, Lohja acquired another Finnish TV manufacturer, Asa Radio Oy in Turku, which had been manufacturing radio receivers and TV sets since 1927. At that time the consumer electronics division of the Lohja group produced annually 170.000 TV sets with the Finlux and ASA brand names.

In 1991, the EL manufacturing was sold to Planar. A new company, Planar International was formed to continue manufacturing EL displays in Espoo, Finland. Planar later consolidated all of its EL manufacturing in Espoo and closed its Oregon EL facility.

In 1992, Finlux TV manufacturing was sold to Nokia, which already was manufacturing TV sets with brands Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic.

In 1996, Nokia sold all its TV factories and brand names to Hong Kong company Semi-Tech, which continued manufacturing TV sets in one factory in Finland until the year 2000, when the Finnish subsidiary of Semi-Tech filed for bankruptcy.

A new company under the &quot;Finlux Oy&quot; name, owned by Norwegian company Otrum Electronics, was formed to continue TV manufacturing. However, they had serious troubles with their product line, which was based on CRT TVs. The market had swung to flat-panel TVs and Finlux failed to switch in time. With 50 million euros in debt, the company filed for bankruptcy in September 2005.

In 2006, the Turkish electronics company Vestel, owned by the Zorlu Holding corporate group, bought the Finlux brand.

== Sponsorship ==

Finlux was the main shirt sponsor for the Swedish team Hammarby 2008–2009.

Finlux sponsored Sheffield Wednesday Football Club from 1986 to 1988, with the unfortunate consequence that the brand name still appears on footage from the Hillsborough disaster.

<doc id="1179183" wikidata="Q5080404" url="?curid=1179183" title="Charles Lyell, 2nd Baron Lyell">
<text>Captain Charles Antony Lyell, 2nd Baron Lyell, VC (14 June 1913 – 27 April 1943) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
He was the son of Charles Henry Lyell and his wife Rosalind Margaret Watney. His father died in 1918 and he succeeded his grandfather as Baron Lyell in 1926. He was educated at Eton College and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1932, graduating in 1936.
Both his father and his grandfather, Leonard Lyell were Liberal MPs. Between 1936 and his death, Lord Lyell was a member of Boodle&#x27;s club in St James&#x27;s, London. He moved to his family&#x27;s estate in Kirriemuir in Angus, where he was a county councillor before the Second World War .

He married Sophie Mary Trafford on 4 July 1938. They had one son, who became Charles Lyell, 3rd Baron Lyell.

His portrait was painted by James McIntosh Patrick in 1940.

==Victoria Cross action==
Lyell was 29 years old, and a temporary captain in the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the period 22–27 April 1943 near Dj Bou Arada, Tunisia, Captain Lord Lyell&#x27;s outstanding leadership and gallantry enabled his company to take its objective. On 27 April accompanied by a sergeant, a lance-corporal and two guardsmen, he led an attack on an enemy post consisting of an 88mm gun and a heavy machine-gun in two separate pits. He destroyed the crew of the machine-gun with a hand grenade and then, three of the party having become casualties, and with the lance-corporal to give covering fire he leapt into the second pit, killing several of the crew before being overwhelmed and killed. Both the guns had been silenced. The others involved in the action were: Lance-Sergeant 2698583 James Robertson (killed), Lance-Corporal 2699878 James Ramage Kinghorn Lawrie, Guardsman 2698039 John Chisholm, and Guardsman 2697572 William Porter (died the next day from a head wound). Lance-Corporal Lawrie and Guardsman Chisholm received the Military Medal, whilst Lance-Sergeant Robertson and Guardsman William Porter were mentioned in dispatches by the King.

He is buried in the Massicault War Cemetery, southwest of Tunis.

<text>Sergeant Major Robert James Bye VC (12 December 1889 − 23 August 1962) was a British Army soldier and a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was born in Pontypridd.

He was 27 years old, and a Sergeant in the 1st Bn., Welsh Guards, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on 31 July 1917 at the Yser Canal, Belgium during the Third Battle of Ypres for which he was awarded the VC.

When the 1/Welsh Guards attacked Pilckem Ridge the leading units, following a creeping barrage, achieved their first objective of the Black Line, but were then halted by two pill boxes. Bye rushed one, put it out of action and then rejoined his unit.

After suffering heavy casualties the Guards moved on to attack the Green Line. Held up by a series of blockhouses, Bye volunteered to take charge of a party, which captured the blockhouses along with many prisoners. Still more prisoners were taken when he advanced to the Green Line.
His citation read:
Bye, who moved to Nottinghamshire to work as a coal miner, also served in World War II as a sergeant major in the Sherwood Foresters guarding prisoners of war until ill health (arising from his pit work) forced him to leave the army. He then served in the Home Guard and as a temporary police constable.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Welsh Guards RHQ) in London, England.

<text>Shivraj Vishwanath Patil (born 12 October 1935) is an Indian politician who was the Minister of Home Affairs of India, from 2004 to 2008 and 10th Speaker of the Lok Sabha from 1991 to 1996. He was Governor of the state of Punjab and Administrator of the Union Territory of Chandigarh from 2010 to 2015. Previously, he served in the Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi cabinets as Minister of Defence during the 1980s.

Patil resigned from the post of Home Minister on 30 November 2008, following widespread criticism raised after 2008 Mumbai attacks, and took moral responsibility for the security lapse that led to the attacks.

==Early life==
Patil was born on 12 October 1935 in the village of Chakur in the Latur district (Marathwada region) of the then princely state of Hyderabad, now Maharashtra, India. He attended Osmania University, Hyderabad, earning a degree in Science and studied law at Bombay University. During 1967–69, he was involved in local government (Latur Municipality). Keshavrao Sonawane and Manikrao Sonawane helped Shivaraj Patil to get his first break to stand from Latur Constituency.

Patil belongs to the Lingayat community. He married Vijaya Patil in June 1963, and has two children - a son and a daughter - with her. He is also a devout follower of Sathya Sai Baba.

==In state politics==
From 1972 to 1980, he was legislator of Latur City of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for two terms of 1972 to 1978 and 1978 to 1980 during which time he held various positions such as Chairman of Public Undertakings Committee, Deputy Minister (Law &amp; Judiciary, Irrigation, Protocol), Deputy Speaker of the Assembly and Speaker of the Assembly.

==In central politics==
In 1980, he was elected to the 7th Lok Sabha from Latur constituency. By 1999, he had won seven successive Lok Sabha elections in 1980, 1984, 1989, 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999. In 2004 Lok Sabha election, he lost to Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Rupatai Patil Nilangekar.

==In government==

First inducted in the Indira Gandhi-led government in as Minister of State for Defence (1980–82), he was given independent charge of the Commerce Ministry (1982–83), from where he was shifted to Science and Technology, Atomic Energy, Electronics, Space and Ocean Development (1983–84).
During 1983–86, he was vice-president of CSIR India. He also served on various committees including those on Defence, External Affairs, Finance, Salaries and Allowances of members of parliament.

In the Rajiv Gandhi government, he was Minister for Personnel, Defence production and later held independent charge of Civil Aviation and Tourism.

He has also held a number of important positions in the party ever since Sonia Gandhi took over the presidency of the party. He is largely known for introducing the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award, India in 1992. He was the chairman of the manifesto committee of the party during the 1999 Lok Sabha election.

As speaker of the Lok Sabha, he had begun or contributed in initiatives on information dissemination to members of the Parliament (through computerisation and modernisation), construction of Parliament Library Building and broadcast of Lok Sabha proceedings, including live broadcast of Question Hour of both houses of the parliament.

Between 1991 and 1995, he was a member/leader of Indian parliamentary delegations to various international parliamentary conferences.

He became Home Minister in 2004. A former Lok Sabha speaker, Shivraj Patil lost in the 2004 polls from Latur in Maharashtra, but has still landed up the second most important position in the Union Cabinet—that of the Home Minister. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in July 2004. It is also said if not for losing the election he would have been the Prime Minister, and the reason he lost the election was due to the opponent getting sympathy vote for losing a family member who was a mass leader. His tenure as home minister was marred by one debacle after another and he faced increasing calls for his resignation, eventually forcing it due to the mishandling in the events leading up to and after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Not to be forgotten also are the 2006 Malegaon bombings, at a Muslim graveyard.

United States Ambassador David Mulford in an embassy cable described his removal after the Mumbai terrorist attack as inevitable and called him &quot;inept&quot; and &quot;asleep on the watch&quot;.

Patil is accused for not sending the Central Reserve Police Force to Nandigram, even after repeated requests by the West Bengal government, to restore law and order in the area and the events resulted in police firing and killing of men and women in Nandigram.

Patil&#x27;s name was considered a likely candidate in 2007 presidential election. However, after the Left opposed his candidacy, Sonia Gandhi proposed Pratibha Patil, Governor of Rajasthan, as the presidential candidate. Shivraj Patil was later considered a possible candidate for the post of Vice-President of India.

On 30 November 2008, just four days after Bombay blasts, Patil resigned from his position of Home Minister in Union Cabinet taking moral responsibility for the security lapse that led to the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.

Post 26/11, Shivraj Patil was made the Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator from 2010 to 2015.

==Controversies==
Shivraj Patil is referred to as Nero of India. He was reported to have been changing clothes for public appearances while the country was under a terror attack. His actions are compared to Nero who played his fiddle while the city burned as Patil focused on changing his clothes while the country was witnessing a terror attack. He is also criticized to have omitted this episode from his autobiography.

<text>Lieutenant Christopher Furness (17 May 1912 – 24 May 1940) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Furness was born in London on 17 May 1912, the eldest son and heir (in his lifetime) of The Honourable Marmaduke Furness (later the 1st Viscount Furness) and his first wife Ada &quot;Daisy&quot; (née Hogg). Christopher Furness was educated at Eton College.

==VC action==
Furness was 28 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards, British Army during the Second World War Battle of France when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the period 17–24 May 1940 near Arras, France, Lieutenant Furness commanded the Carrier Platoon when his battalion formed part of the garrison of the town.

On 23 May the platoon was ordered to cover the withdrawal of the transport (over 40 vehicles) to Douai. Early on 24 May the enemy were advancing along the road where the transport columns were moving and Lieutenant Furness decided to attack. He reached the enemy position under heavy fire and when the light tanks and all the carriers and their crews had become casualties he engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat until he was killed.

His fight against hopeless odds made the enemy withdraw temporarily and enabled the vehicles and survivors to get clear.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross, still owned by the Furness family, is loaned to and displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Welsh Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London.

==Commemoration==
Furness is commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial.

<text>Sergeant Oliver Brooks (31 May 1889 − 25 October 1940) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Paulton, Somerset, he was 26 years old, and a lance-sergeant in the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 8 October 1915 near Loos, France, Lance-Sergeant Brooks led a party of bombers against the enemy who had captured 200 yards of Allied trenches. The regaining of this lost ground was entirely due to the bravery and presence of mind of this NCO who accomplished his task in the midst of a hail of bombs from the enemy.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Coldstream Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London.

The King George V was in France at the time and was seriously injured on 28 October 1915 when thrown by his horse at a troop review. The King sustained a broken pelvis and deep bruising, and he was taken to a hospital train for the journey home. He insisted on presenting the VC to the Lance-Sergeant personally, so Oliver Brooks reported to the King&#x27;s bedside on the train. With assistance from equerry Sir Charles Cust, the medal was attached to Brooks&#x27; uniform by the King.

<text>Cyril Hubert Frisby VC (17 September 1885 – 10 September 1961) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Awarded the VC for his actions in the Battle of Canal du Nord during the First World War, in later life he was a prominent sports fisherman.

== Early life ==
Frisby was born on 17 September 1885 at New Barnet, Hertfordshire, the second son of Henry and Zoe Frisby. He was educated at Haileybury College. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange in 1911. The same year he married Audrey Ogilvie-Grant in London; the couple had a son, born two years later.

Frisby was a noted athlete for Polytechnic Harriers and finished second behind Swede Ernest Wilde in the 880 yards event at the 1913 AAA Championships. As the highest placed British athlete he was regarded as the National 880 yards champion.

== First World War ==

Frisby joined the Hampshire Regiment as a private in October 1916 and within weeks was undergoing officer training. He was commissioned in the Coldstream Guards in March 1917 as a second lieutenant. He was posted to the Western Front in November, where he joined the regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion. Early the following year, he was promoted to acting captain.

On 27 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the Coldstream Guards was engaged in the Battle of Canal du Nord, near Graincourt. His battalion was tasked with the capture of a canal crossing, with Frisby himself in command of one of the attacking companies. Once over the canal, he was to set up defensive positions and make contact with the adjacent 3rd Guards Battalion. On reaching the canal, barbed wire, together with heavy fire from a German machine-gun post under the bridge on the far side of the canal halted the advance. Frisby, together with a lance-corporal, Thomas Jackson, and two others, got through the wire and climbed down into the canal under intense fire. With a further twelve men joining him, he led the capture of the post. Despite a leg wound, he then attended forming a defensive line as per his instructions. While doing so, he had led an adjacent leaderless company in fighting off a counter-attack.

For his actions, Frisby was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), one of seven that were awarded for actions performed on 27 September. The citation for his VC read:
After the battle, the 1st Battalion was withdrawn to Boursies. Jackson, the lance corporal who had initially assisted Frisby that day, was later killed and posthumously awarded the VC. When Frisby was presented with his medal by King George V, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 29 March 1919, Jackson&#x27;s family was also there to receive his medal. Frisby was able to explain to them the circumstances of their relative&#x27;s VC award. Frisby&#x27;s brother Lionel also served in the First World War with the 6th Welsh Regiment as an acting lieutenant colonel; he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

==Later life==

After the war Frisby spent much of his time tuna fishing, becoming prominent in the sport and competing in international fishing competitions. In the 1930s, fishing off the coast of Scarborough, he caught a specimen. He also set a world record of 1.25 tons, for the greatest weight of fish caught in a day by an angler, ( The End of the Line (book), page 52). Also active in the British Legion, he became president of the Stoughton and Westborough branch in 1940, having previously served as its vice-president.

Frisby died on 10 September 1961 at his home in Guildford aged 75; his wife had predeceased him by almost a year. He and his wife are buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey. His son later donated Frisby&#x27;s medals, which in addition to the VC included the British War Medal, the Victory Medal with Oak Leaf, the Defence Medal 1939–45, and Coronation Medals for 1937 and 1953, to the Coldstream Guards Museum, where they are on display at the regimental headquarters at Wellington Barracks in London.

<text>Lieutenant General Gerald Littlehales Goodlake VC (14 May 1832 – 5 April 1890) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Gerald Goodlake was the son of Thomas Mills Goodlake of Wadley at Faringdon in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) and his wife, Emilia Maria, the daughter of Sir Edward Baker, 1st Baronet of Ranston in Dorset. He was commissioned into the 21st Regiment of Foot on 14 June 1850. He exchanged (by purchase) into the Coldstream Guards on 27 June 1851. He served in the Crimea with the 1st Battalion and took part in the battles of Alma, Inkerman, Balaclava and Sevastopol.

==Victoria Cross==
Goodlake was 22 years old, and a brevet major in the Coldstream Guards, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 October 1854 at Inkerman, Crimea, Major Goodlake was in command of a party of sharpshooters which held Windmill Ravine against a much larger force of the enemy, killing 38 (including an officer) and taking three prisoners. He also showed conspicuous gallantry on a later occasion when his sharpshooters surprised a picquet and seized the knapsacks and rifles of the enemy.

He later achieved the rank of lieutenant general.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Grenadier Guards RHQ) in Wellington Barracks, London, England.

<text>Lance Corporal Thomas Norman Jackson VC (11 February 1897 – 27 September 1918) was a British Army soldier and an English posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, during the First World War.

==Early life==
Thomas Norman Jackson was born on 11 February 1897 in Swinton in the then West Riding of Yorkshire to Thomas Edwin Jackson, a worker at a supplier of mineral water, and Emma Jackson. After completing his schooling, he started working alongside his father. He later took up employment at the Great Central Locomotive Depot, based at Mexborough.

==First World War==
In November 1915, Jackson enlisted in the British Army and, in October 1917, was posted to the 1st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards, which was serving in France on the Western Front at the time. He participated in the Battle of Cambrai the following month. He was later promoted to lance corporal.

On 27 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the Coldstream Guards was engaged in the Battle of Canal du Nord, near Graincourt. Jackson&#x27;s battalion was tasked with the capture of a canal crossing. Once over the canal, it was to set up defensive positions and make contact with the adjacent 3rd Guards Battalion. On reaching the canal, the advance of Jackson&#x27;s company, under the command of Captain Cyril Frisby, was halted by barbed wire together with heavy fire from a German machine-gun post under the bridge on the far side of the canal. Jackson, together with Frisby and two others, got through the wire and climbed down into the canal under intense fire. With a further twelve men joining them, the post was captured.

Later in the morning, Jackson was ordered to move forward with a platoon to seize a German-held trench. He was first into the trench, and after killing two German soldiers, he in turn was killed. His grave is at Sanders Keep Military Cemetery, Graincourt-les-Havrincourt, which is to the west of Cambrai.
For his actions on 27 September 1918, Jackson was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), one of seven that would be awarded for actions performed on 27 September. The citation for his VC reads:

King George V presented Jackson&#x27;s VC to his parents in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 29 March 1919. Also present was Jackson&#x27;s fiancée Daisy Flatt. Captain Frisby, in attendance at the same ceremony to receive his own award of the VC for his role in the action of 27 September 1918, was able to explain to Jackson&#x27;s family the circumstances of their relative&#x27;s VC award. A few months later Frisby travelled to Swindon to unveil a painting commemorating Jackson.

==Medals==
In June 1969, Jackson&#x27;s brother donated his medals, which in addition to the VC also included the British War Medal and Victory Medal to The Coldstream Guards Regimental Headquarters at Wellington Barracks in London, where they are on display.

<text>Captain Ian Oswald Liddell VC (19 October 1919 – 21 April 1945) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Born in Shanghai, he enlisted as a private in the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry in 1940 before being commissioned in the Coldstream Guards. Whilst stationed in London, he was involved with the reception of Rudolf Hess in the Tower of London who had been arrested in Scotland, his brother David having had a part in his capture.

==The VC action==
Liddell was 25 years old, and a temporary captain in the 5th Battalion, Coldstream Guards, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

In Germany, on 3 April 1945, Liddell was commanding a company of the Coldstream Guards, which was ordered to capture intact a bridge over the River Ems near Lingen. The bridge was covered on the far bank by an enemy strong point, which was subsequently discovered to consist of 150 entrenched infantry supported by three 88 mm and two 20 mm guns. The bridge was also prepared for demolition with 250 kg bombs, which could plainly be seen. Having directed his two leading platoons onto the near bank, Captain Liddell ran forward alone to the bridge and scaled the 3 m high road block guarding it, with the intention of neutralising the charges and taking the bridge intact. In order to achieve his object he had to cross the whole length of the bridge by himself under intense enemy fire, which increased as his objective became apparent to the Germans. Having disconnected the charges on the far side, he re-crossed the bridge and cut the wires on the near side. It was necessary for him to kneel, forming an easy target, whilst he successively cut the wires. He then discovered that there were also charges underneath the bridge. Completely undeterred he also disconnected these. His task completed, he then climbed up on to the road-block in full view of the enemy and signalled his leading platoon to advance. Thus alone and unprotected, without cover, and under heavy enemy fire, he achieved his object. The bridge was captured intact and the way cleared for the advance across the River Ems.

He was killed in action near Rotenburg an der Wümme in Germany (a town near Scheeßel) on 21 April 1945. He was shot by a sniper whose bullet killed another officer, going through his head and then into Liddell. He is buried in Becklingen War Cemetery, Soltau, Germany.

==The Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Coldstream Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London, England.

==Family==
Liddell&#x27;s grandfather, Sir Charles Oswald Liddell, was the owner of Shirenewton Hall, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire.

In January 1945 in Kensington, London, he married Patricia Mary Patton-Bethune, daughter of Charlie Lionel Patton-Bethune MC (1882-1957) and his wife Mary Monica Lester (1881-1968). At the time she was a Section Officer in the WAAF and it was she who received her husband&#x27;s VC from King George VI in a special investiture for next of kin held at Buckingham Palace on 12 February 1946.

<text>Thomas Whitham VC (11 May 1888 – 22 October 1924) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==War service==
On 25 January 1915, Whitham enlisted in the British Army. He was 29 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 31 July 1917 at Pilckem near Ypres, Belgium, during an attack an enemy machine-gun was seen to be enfilading the battalion on the right. Private Whitham on his own initiative immediately worked his way from shell-hole to shell-hole through our own barrage, reached the machine-gun and, although under very heavy fire captured it, together with an officer and two other ranks. This bold action was of great assistance to the battalion and undoubtedly saved many lives.

==Post war==
After the war he became a bricklayer but he struggled to find work. He was forced to sell his VC and a gold watch that had been presented to him by Burnley council in recognition of his bravery. Both ended up in a pawn shop but were rescued by the council and remain on display in the Towneley Hall Art Gallery &amp; Museums in Burnley. Thomas died in poverty aged 36. He was buried on 27 October 1924 at Wheatley Lane Inghamite Church. In 1952 a grave memorial was erected for him by the Coldstream Guards association.

In 2008, it was announced that Burnley Schools&#x27; Sixth Form would be renamed Thomas Whitham Sixth Form.

A grandson was professional footballer Jack Whitham.

<text>The Enforcer is a 1976 American action-thriller film and the third in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film series. Directed by James Fargo, it stars Clint Eastwood as Inspector &quot;Dirty&quot; Harry Callahan, Tyne Daly as Inspector Kate Moore, and DeVeren Bookwalter as criminal mastermind Bobby Maxwell. It was also the last film in the series to feature John Mitchum as Inspector Frank DiGiorgio.

The film is memorable for containing more comedic dialogue than any other entry in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise, as well as offering a more fleshed-out partner for protagonist Callahan.

== Plot ==
In Marin County, two gas-company workers are lured by a scantily clad woman to a remote spot in Mill Valley, where both are killed by Bobby Maxwell. Maxwell leads a group of men and women calling themselves the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), who pose as a terrorist organization to conceal the true purpose of their criminal activities.

Inspector Harry Callahan and his partner Frank DiGiorgio deal with a con artist faking a heart attack at a restaurant before being called in to deal with a holdup at a liquor store. When the robbers take hostages and demand a police car so they can escape, Callahan drives his into the front of the store and uses the resulting chaos to gun them down. Callahan&#x27;s superior, Captain Jerome McKay, angrily reprimands him for &quot;use of excessive force&quot;, injuring the hostages and causing $14,379 in damages; as punishment, he is transferred to the personnel department, where he is forced to participate in the interview process for promotions. Callahan is dismayed to learn that under the mayor&#x27;s new affirmative-action rules, several of the promotions must go to women, including Kate Moore, a desk officer with no field experience.

The PRSF uses the stolen gas-company van and uniforms to steal M72 LAW rockets, M16 rifles, a taser, and other weapons from a warehouse. DiGiorgio and another officer catch them in the act, but Maxwell fatally wounds DiGiorgio with a knife, runs the other cop over with the van, and kills one of his own followers despite her only having minor wounds. Callahan is transferred back to the homicide squad, but is distressed to find out that Moore is his new partner. While watching a United States Army demonstration of the LAW rocket on a firing range, Callahan notices Moore standing right behind the rocket and pulls her out of the way of potentially lethal backblast. Irritated, Callahan tells Moore he is doubtful of her ability to perform in dangerous situations, and warns her that a failure in such an incident could endanger both their lives.

Callahan and Moore are leaving an autopsy at the Hall of Justice when a bomb explodes in the bathroom. The inspectors chase down and capture the bomber, and meet &quot;Big&quot; Ed Mustapha, the leader of a black militant group to which the bomber formerly belonged. Although Callahan makes a deal with Mustapha for information, McKay arrests his followers and him for the PRSF&#x27;s crimes, damaging Callahan&#x27;s credibility. Callahan angrily refuses to participate in a televised press conference in which the publicity-seeking mayor intends to commend Moore and him for Mustapha&#x27;s arrest; McKay then suspends Callahan and takes his badge, but Moore informs Callahan that she will continue to help him in any way she can, and the two share drinks in a sign of mutual respect.

The PRSF ambushes the mayor&#x27;s motorcade as he leaves a Giants game at Candlestick Park, killing his bodyguard and aide and taking him hostage with a ransom of $5 million. Callahan bails out Mustapha, who gives him the name of a priest who mentored Maxwell; Moore then saves Callahan&#x27;s life when Wanda (disguised as a nun) tries to shoot him in the back. The priest reveals that the PRSF members are squatting on Alcatraz Island. Callahan distracts the gang while Moore frees the mayor, but Maxwell kills her before they can get off the island. Callahan avenges Moore by cornering Maxwell in an old guard tower and blowing it up with a LAW rocket. Ignoring the mayor&#x27;s profuse gratitude, Callahan abandons him and walks over to his partner&#x27;s corpse as McKay arrives in a helicopter and announces to the deceased Maxwell that the SFPD will give in to all of his demands.

==Cast==
== Production ==

=== Script ===

The first script was written in 1974 by two young San Francisco-area film students, Gail Morgan Hickman and S.W. Schurr, with the title &quot;Moving Target&quot;. After seeing &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, the two fledgling writers decided to pen a screenplay of their own featuring the character of Inspector Harry Callahan. Inspired by the Patty Hearst kidnapping in 1974, the storyline had Inspector Harry Callahan going up against a violent militant group reminiscent of the Symbionese Liberation Army. In the script, the militants kidnap and ransom the mayor of San Francisco.

After the screenplay was finished, Hickman visited Eastwood&#x27;s Carmel restaurant, the Hog&#x27;s Breath Inn, and approached Eastwood&#x27;s business partner, Paul Lippman, asking if he would give their effort to Eastwood. Lippman was initially hesitant, but finally agreed. Although Eastwood thought the script needed work, he liked the concept, particularly the priest with militant leanings and the portrayal of black militants, which was based on the Black Panther Party.

Warner Bros., meanwhile, eager to capitalize on the success of the two &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films, had hired seasoned screenwriter Stirling Silliphant to write a new Harry Callahan story. Silliphant wrote a script called &quot;Dirty Harry and More&quot;, in which the Callahan character was teamed up with a female, Asian-American partner named More. Eastwood liked the female partner angle, but felt the script spent too much time on character and did not have enough action. Eastwood then showed the Hickman/Schurr script to Silliphant, and Silliphant agreed to rewrite it.

Silliphant wrote the script throughout late 1975 and early 1976, and delivered his draft to Eastwood in February 1976. While Eastwood approved, he believed the emphasis was still too much on the character relationships rather than the action, and was concerned the fans might not approve. He then brought in screenwriter Dean Riesner, who had worked on the scripts of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, to do revisions.

=== Casting ===
Recurring characters Lieutenant Bressler (Harry Guardino) and Frank DiGiorgio (Mitchum) reprise their roles for the last time in a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film. Bressler was Callahan&#x27;s boss in the first film of the series; DiGiorgio appeared in the previous two, but dies in this film. A new character, Captain Jerome McKay (Dillman), was introduced as Callahan&#x27;s superior officer. Dillman played a similar role, Captain Briggs, in &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;.

Albert Popwell also returns as a character in this film, having played the Bank Robber in the first film of the series and Sidney the pimp in &quot;Magnum Force&quot;.

The character of Kate Moore, Harry&#x27;s female partner, went to Tyne Daly. Daly&#x27;s casting was initially uncertain, given that she turned down the role three times. She objected to the way her character was treated in parts of the film and showed concern that two members of the police force falling in love on the job was problematic, given that they would be putting their lives in jeopardy by not reaching peak efficiency. Daly was permitted to read the drafts of the script developed by Riesner and had significant leeway in the development of her character, although after seeing the film at the premiere, was horrified by the extent of the violence. Regarding Callahan&#x27;s relationship with Moore, Eastwood stated:

=== Filming ===
When production began, the working title of the film was &quot;Dirty Harry III&quot;, in keeping with other sequels of the time. Eastwood felt that the film needed a title of its own, and in the middle of production came up with &quot;The Enforcer&quot;.

After his disputes with Ted Post on the set of the previous &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; installment, Eastwood fully intended to direct &quot;The Enforcer&quot; himself. Eastwood&#x27;s replacement of Philip Kaufman on &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (and the consequent need to handle post-production on that film) left him without enough time to prepare himself to direct &quot;The Enforcer&quot;. As a result, Eastwood gave the director&#x27;s chair to James Fargo, his longtime assistant director, who made his debut as a full director on this film. Eastwood had the final say on all the critical decisions, but since the two men were far more familiar with each other&#x27;s working styles than Eastwood had been with Ted Post, they rarely butted heads during production.

Filming commenced in the San Francisco Bay area in the summer of 1976. Eastwood was initially still dubious about the quantity of his lines and preferred a less talkative approach, something perhaps embedded in him by Sergio Leone. The film ended up considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films, and was cut to 95 minutes for its final running time.

The music score for &quot;The Enforcer&quot; was written by Jerry Fielding, making &quot;The Enforcer&quot; the only &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film without a score by Lalo Schifrin. The film was originally intended to be the last &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film of a trilogy. A poll conducted by Warner Bros. in 1983 led to the development of a fourth film, &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;, and the resurrection of the film series. Eastwood never intended to make more &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films, but private agreements with the studio allowed him to do more &quot;personal&quot; films in exchange for doing the subsequent sequels.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
Richard Eder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was negative, stating: &quot;Money, the big name of Clint Eastwood, a lot of gore and howling sirens and the urge to rail at various liberal notions are not enough to make even a passable movie out of &quot;The Enforcer&quot;&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was positive and called it &quot;the best of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movies at striking a balance between the action and the humor. Sometimes in the previous films, we felt uneasy laughing in between the bloodshed, but this time, the movie&#x27;s more thoughtfully constructed and paced.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and wrote, &quot;the major disappointment in &quot;The Enforcer&quot; is its disjointed script with its relative absence of thrills.&quot; Another criticism he had was that Harry&#x27;s opponents were now &quot;cartoon idiots&quot; in contrast with the memorable Scorpio from the first &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; indicated that the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; &quot;format seems to be falling apart at the seams,&quot; concluding, &quot;The next project from this particular mold had better shape up or give up.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;Clint Eastwood&#x27;s third and arguably best &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movie,&quot; with &quot;a good cast&quot; and &quot;unprecedented humor&quot; that &quot;results from the film&#x27;s tonic, highly developed sense of the absurd that runs through its fast-paced mayhem.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;lacks both the effective gimmicks and the slambang kinetic force of its predecessors. Elements that once generated some melodramatic heat have cooled into inside jokes and aged into venerable wheezes.&quot; Janet Maslin stated in &quot;Newsweek&quot; that &quot;&quot;The Enforcer&quot; shows very little understanding of the charismatic single-mindedness that made Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Inspector Harry Callahan such a crowd pleaser in the first place ... each of the two sequels – the first was &quot;Magnum Force&quot; – has paid less attention to Harry&#x27;s righteous indignation than to the mayhem he generates. The gore has now become so gratuitous that Harry has begun to look like a trigger-happy fool.&quot;

Eastwood was named &quot;Worst Actor of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, and the film was criticized for its level of violence.

Eastwood&#x27;s performance in the third installment was overshadowed by positive reviews given to Daly as the strong-minded female cop, with which she would follow up a similar role as Det. Mary Beth Lacey in the television series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;. Daly received rave reviews, with Marjorie Rosen remarking that Malpaso &quot;had invented a heroine of steel&quot; and Jean Hoelscher of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praising Eastwood for abandoning his ego in casting such a strong female actress in his film. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a score of 69% based on reviews from 39 critics, 27 of whom were judged to be positive and 12 negative. Its critics consensus reads: &quot;Though the slightest hints of series fatigue begin to emerge, &quot;The Enforcer&quot; delivers riveting action and better humor than its predecessors.&quot;

=== Box office ===

Upon release in December 1976, &quot;The Enforcer&quot; was a major commercial success, grossing $8,851,288 in its first week, a record for a Clint Eastwood film at the time.

It grossed a total of $46,236,000 in the United States and Canada, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1976. Overall, this figure made it the most profitable of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series for seven years until the release of &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; (1983).

<text>Captain John Hollington Grayburn VC (30 January 1918 – 20 September 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in 1918, Grayburn was educated at Sherborne School in Dorset and joined the Army Cadet Force before the outbreak of the Second World War. He was initially commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and later joined the Parachute Regiment. At the age of 26 he went into action in the Battle of Arnhem where he was part of the small force that was able to reach Arnhem road bridge. Between 17 and 20 September he led his platoon, and later the remnants of a battalion, in the defence of the small British perimeter around the bridge, but was killed after standing up in full view of a German tank in order to direct his men to new positions.

Grayburn is buried in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery, and his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum in England.

==Early life==
John Grayburn was born on 30 January 1918 on Manora Island, India, the son of Lionel Markham and Gertrude Grayburn. The family returned to England whilst he was young. From 1931 to 1935 he attended Sherborne School in Dorset where he was a member of Abbey House. After leaving Sherborne School he joined the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.

Grayburn played rugby for the Chiltern Rugby Club between 1927 and 1939 and was a skilled boxer.

Grayburn joined the Army Cadet Force and was posted to the 1st (London) Cadet Force, The Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment. In September 1940 he was given an emergency commission to second lieutenant and was posted to the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry.

==Second World War==
Grayburn was promoted to war substantive lieutenant in 1942 and married Marcelle Chambers, with whom he had a son, in the same year. However, the Ox and Bucks remained on the home front and Grayburn became bored with the inactivity. Instead he applied to the Parachute Regiment and in June 1943 he was transferred to the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The following year he was transferred to the regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, and took command of 2 Platoon, A Company.

===Battle of Arnhem===
The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, an attempt to secure a string of bridges through the Netherlands. At Arnhem the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine, the final objectives of the operation. However, the airborne forces that dropped on 17 September were not aware that the remnants of the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer divisions were also near Arnhem for rest and refitting. Their presence added a substantial number of Panzergrenadiers, tanks and self-propelled guns to the German defences and the Allies suffered heavily in the ensuing battle. Only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge before being overrun on 21 September. The rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge and had to be evacuated on 25 September. The Allies failed to cross the Rhine, which remained under German control until Allied offensives in March 1945.

====Advance to the bridge====
1st Airborne Division&#x27;s commanding officer, Major General Roy Urquhart, originally planned for the 2nd Battalion to lead the 1st Parachute Brigade into Arnhem to secure the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine. Frost chose Major Digby Tatham-Warter&#x27;s A Company to lead the battalion&#x27;s march from the drop zones to the bridges, knowing him to be &quot;a thruster if ever there was&quot;. A Company was in action almost at once, ambushing a small German recce group near the drop zone. The company moved off through the woods toward the river road, with each platoon taking turns to lead. There was a brief plan to advance the platoons by jeep once out of the woods, but German forces were encountered shortly afterwards and the idea was not followed up. Grayburn had just arrived at a road junction and headed north when the men behind him came under enemy fire. After laying a smokescreen he led a charge that cleared the enemy positions. Tatham-Warter lacked confidence in the Airborne radio equipment and had trained his platoons to use bugle calls; it was with the charge that Grayburn signalled that the advance could be resumed.

A Company was not significantly delayed by the German patrols it encountered later, although the presence of cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion as it passed through Oosterbeek. As they approached the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to cross it. A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by manoeuvering through the back gardens of the houses on either side of the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn&#x27;s platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it fed into the town centre.

====Defence of the bridge====

Grayburn did not fire on the occasional German traffic still using the bridge, preferring not to advertise the Allied presence until the rest of the battalion had arrived. Upon his arrival, Frost began securing more buildings around the ramp, and a small section attack was made on the bridge. The German defenders quickly repulsed this however and Tatham-Warter organised a stronger attack, to be led by Grayburn.

As soon as it was sufficiently dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward on either side of the girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.

Over the next few days, every man of the 700 or so who had made it to the bridge and whether a combat trooper or not, was engaged in the defence of the British perimeter. A Company was sited in the buildings on either side of the ramp nearest the river, and on Monday 18 2 Platoon occupied a house on the east side. This sector came under increasing attack from tanks and infantry of the 10th SS Panzer Division, and the building was later burnt down.

The rest of the division made several efforts to reinforce Frost&#x27;s men, but were unable to break through the German forces that surrounded the bridge. The exact disposition of the British troops subsequently became more confused as the battle developed into house to house fighting. Tatham-Warter took command of 2nd Battalion on Tuesday 19, and Grayburn temporarily took command of A Company after Tatham-Warter&#x27;s designated replacement was wounded. Grayburn led several fighting patrols that forced the Germans to commit more armour but as Wednesday 20 dawned, the British position was becoming untenable. As the Germans squeezed the perimeter they laid explosives on a section of the ramp crossing a road next to the riverbank, lest XXX Corps should break through and capture the bridge from the south. Grayburn led another patrol that forced the enemy away from the arch while Royal Engineers removed the fuzes. Grayburn was wounded again but quickly returned after being treated, now with his head bandaged and arm in a sling. German infantry later returned to relay the charges and a second patrol went out to remove them. A German tank had come forward to cover the arch, but in order to direct his men to better positions Grayburn stood up in full view of it. The tank&#x27;s machine gun killed him instantly.

Frost&#x27;s perimeter gradually shrank as men and ammunition ran low, and Frost himself was wounded on 20 September. A brief ceasefire was held later that day to allow the evacuation of wounded men in danger of becoming trapped and being burned alive in the cellars of wrecked buildings. Despite the best efforts of the remaining men to hold out overnight, they were finally overrun in the early hours of 21 September.

==Victoria Cross==

Major Tatham-Warter was able to escape German captivity and later led nearly 140 men to safety in Operation Pegasus. Upon his return to England he wrote a report on the action at the bridge, which led to Grayburn&#x27;s posthumous promotion to captain and the award of the Victoria Cross.

The full citation for Grayburn&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 23 January 1945, reading:

==Legacy==
After his death, Grayburn was buried on the bridge embankment close to where he was killed. His remains were recovered in 1948 and added to the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery. Although most graves in the cemetery are organised by unit, Grayburn&#x27;s is separate from the other parachute formations. His VC is in the care of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum and there are plaques in his memory at Chalfont St Giles parish church, and at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation war memorial in Hong Kong, where Grayburn&#x27;s uncle worked before the war. He is also commemorated on the Sherborne School War Memorial and in the Sherborne School Book of Remembrance. A room in the clubhouse of Amersham and Chiltern Rugby Club is named after him. He is also named prominently on the front panel of the plinth unveiled at the new student accommodation in James Wolfe Road, Oxford on 16 August 2019 at the site of Cowley Barracks.

<doc id="1179217" wikidata="Q423123" url="?curid=1179217" title="Dextran">
<text>Dextran is a complex branched glucan (polysaccharide derived from the condensation of glucose), originally derived from wine. IUPAC defines dextrans as &quot;Branched poly-α-d-glucosides of microbial origin having glycosidic bonds predominantly C-1 → C-6&quot;. Dextran chains are of varying lengths (from 3 to 2000 kilodaltons).

The polymer main chain consists of α-1,6 glycosidic linkages between glucose monomers, with branches from α-1,3 linkages. This characteristic branching distinguishes a dextran from a dextrin, which is a straight chain glucose polymer tethered by α-1,4 or α-1,6 linkages. 

==Occurrence==
Dextran was discovered by Louis Pasteur as a microbial product in wine, but mass production was only possible after the development by Allene Jeanes of a process using bacteria. Dental plaque is rich in dextrans. Dextran is a complicating contaminant in the refining of sugar because it elevates the viscosity of sucrose solutions and fouls plumbing.

Dextran is now produced from sucrose by certain lactic acid bacteria of the family lactobacillus. Species include &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;. The structure of dextran produced depends not only on the family and species of the bacterium but on the strain. They are separated by fractional precipitation from protein-free extracts using ethanol. Some bacteria coproduce fructans, which can complicate isolation of the dextrans.

==Uses==
Dextran 70 is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a health system.

Medicinally it is used as an antithrombotic (antiplatelet), to reduce blood viscosity, and as a volume expander in hypovolaemia.

=== Microsurgery ===
These agents are used commonly by microsurgeons to decrease vascular thrombosis. The antithrombotic effect of dextran is mediated through its binding of erythrocytes, platelets, and vascular endothelium, increasing their electronegativity and thus reducing erythrocyte aggregation and platelet adhesiveness. Dextrans also reduce factor VIII-Ag Von Willebrand factor, thereby decreasing platelet function. Clots formed after administration of dextrans are more easily lysed due to an altered thrombus structure (more evenly distributed platelets with coarser fibrin). By inhibiting α-2 antiplasmin, dextran serves as a plasminogen activator, so possesses thrombolytic features.

Outside of these features, larger dextrans, which do not pass out of the vessels, are potent osmotic agents, thus have been used urgently to treat hypovolemia . The hemodilution caused by volume expansion with dextran use improves blood flow, thus further improving patency of microanastomoses and reducing thrombosis. Still, no difference has been detected in antithrombotic effectiveness in comparison of intra-arterial and intravenous administration of dextran.

Dextrans are available in multiple molecular weights ranging from 3 kDa to 2 MDa. The larger dextrans (&gt;60,000 Da) are excreted poorly from the kidney, so remain in the blood for as long as weeks until they are metabolized. Consequently, they have prolonged antithrombotic and colloidal effects. In this family, dextran-40 (MW: 40,000 Da), has been the most popular member for anticoagulation therapy. Close to 70% of dextran-40 is excreted in urine within the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion, while the remaining 30% are retained for several more days.

===Other medical uses===
* Dextran is used in some eye drops as a lubricant. and in certain intravenous fluids to solubilize other factors, such as iron (in a solution known as Iron Dextran).
*Intravenous solutions with dextran function both as volume expanders and means of parenteral nutrition. Such a solution provides an osmotically neutral fluid that once in the body is digested by cells into glucose and free water. It is occasionally used to replace lost blood in emergency situations, when replacement blood is not available, but must be used with caution as it does not provide necessary electrolytes and can cause hyponatremia or other electrolyte disturbances.
* Dextran also increases blood sugar levels.
* Dextran can be used in an ATPS for PEGylation

===Laboratory uses===
* Dextran is used in the osmotic stress technique for applying osmotic pressure to biological molecules.
* It is also used in some size-exclusion chromatography matrices; an example is Sephadex.
* Dextran has also been used in bead form to aid in bioreactor applications.
* Dextran has been used as an immobilization agent in biosensors.
* Dextran preferentially binds to early endosomes; fluorescent-labelled dextran can be used to visualize these endosomes under a microscope.
* Dextran can be used as a stabilizing coating to protect metal nanoparticles from oxidation and improve biocompatibility.
* Dextran coupled with a fluorescent molecule such as fluorescein isothiocyanate can be used to create concentration gradients of diffusible molecules for imaging and allow subsequent characterization of gradient slope. 
* Solutions of fluorescently-labelled dextran can be perfused through engineered vessels to analyze vascular permeability
* Dextran is used to make microcarriers for industrial cell culture
* Orally-administered dextran sodium sulphate is used to induce colitis in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease.
* Dextran is a common model compound to test the potential of drug formulations to facilitate intestinal absorption via the paracellular route.

==Side effects==
Although relatively few side effects are associated with dextran use, these side effects can be very serious. These include anaphylaxis, volume overload, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, or platelet dysfunction.

An uncommon but significant complication of dextran osmotic effect is acute kidney injury. The pathogenesis of this kidney failure is the subject of many debates with direct toxic effect on tubules and glomerulus versus intraluminal hyperviscosity being some of the proposed mechanisms. Patients with history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or vascular disorders are most at risk. Brooks and others recommend the avoidance of dextran therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease.

==Research==
Efforts have been made to develop modified dextran polymers. One of these has acetal modified hydroxyl groups. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents. This allows it to be processed in the same manner as many polyesters, like poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), through processes like solvent evaporation and emulsion. Acetalated dextran is structurally different from acetylated dextran. As of 2017 several uses for drug delivery had been explored &quot;in vitro&quot; and a few had been tested in animal models.

<text>William Barnsley Allen (8 June 1892 – 27 August 1933) was a British Army medical officer who was decorated for gallantry four times during the First World War, including an award of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Allen attended St Cuthbert&#x27;s College, now Worksop College, then studied medicine at Sheffield University in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He graduated MB and ChB in 1914 and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps a few days after the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. He was commissioned as a lieutenant, and attached to the 3rd West Riding Field Ambulance.

==First World War==
In September 1916 Allen, by then promoted to captain, was awarded the Military Cross for actions on unspecified dates: 
On 3 September 1916 Allen was attached to the 246th (West Riding) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, near Mesnil, France, when the following event took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross &quot;for most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty&quot;:
In 1917 Allen was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross:
For actions in October 1918 Allen (by then acting major) was awarded the Distinguished Service Order:
He also received a mention in despatches at the end of the war.

Allen died of an accidental drug overdose in 1933.

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum in Mytchett, Surrey.

Allen was a member of Sheffield University Officers Training Corps while he was studying medicine. Just off the main mess in the Somme Barracks, home of Sheffield UOTC, there is an ante-room named the &quot;Allen VC Room&quot; which proudly displays on the wall a framed photograph of William, along with the citation as well as a copy of his VC and several of his other medals.

On 3 September 2016, 100 years after he received the Victoria Cross, a commemorative plaque was unveiled in his memory at the Sheffield War Memorial in Barkers&#x27; Pool.

<text>Cupressus dupreziana, the Saharan cypress, or tarout, is a very rare coniferous tree native to the Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer mountains in the central Sahara desert, southeast Algeria, where it forms a unique population of trees hundreds of kilometres from any other trees. There are only 233 specimens of this endangered species, the largest about 22 m tall. The majority are estimated to be over 2000 years old, with very little regeneration due to the increasing desertification of the Sahara. Rainfall totals in the area are estimated to be about 30 mm annually. The largest one is named Tin-Balalan is believed to be the oldest tarout tree with a circumference of 12 meters or 36 feet.

This species is distinct from the allied &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot; (Mediterranean cypress) in its much bluer foliage with a white resin spot on each leaf, the smaller shoots often being flattened in a single plane. It also has smaller cones, only 1.5–2.5 cm long. &quot;Cupressus atlantica&quot; (Moroccan cypress) is more similar, and is treated as a variety of the Saharan cypress (&quot;C. dupreziana&quot; var. &quot;atlantica&quot;) by some authors.

Probably as a result of its isolation and low population, the Saharan cypress has evolved a unique reproductive system of male apomixis whereby the seeds develop entirely from the genetic content of the pollen. There is no genetic input from the female &quot;parent&quot;, which only provides nutritional sustenance. The Moroccan cypress does not share this characteristic.

The Saharan cypress is occasionally cultivated in southern and western Europe, in part for &quot;ex situ&quot; genetic conservation, but also as an ornamental tree.

An international arboretum is being established in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia within which will be established forests of rare and endangered species from throughout the world. One of these forests is dedicated to &quot;Cupressus dupreziana&quot; and 1300 of the trees have been propagated for planting in late 2007.

<doc id="1179229" wikidata="Q785461" url="?curid=1179229" title="Sudden Impact">
<text>Sudden Impact is a 1983 American action-thriller film, the fourth in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series, directed, produced by, and starring Clint Eastwood (making it the only &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film to be directed by Eastwood himself) and co-starring Sondra Locke. The film tells the story of a gang-rape victim (Locke) who decides to seek revenge on her rapists 10 years after the attack by killing them one by one. Inspector Callahan (Eastwood), famous for his unconventional and often brutal crime-fighting tactics, is tasked with tracking down the serial killer.

The film is notable for the catchphrase &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot;, written by John Milius and uttered by Clint Eastwood&#x27;s gun-wielding character in the beginning of the film as he stares down an armed robber who is holding a hostage. This is the last &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film to feature Albert Popwell.

==Plot==
In 1973, artist Jennifer Spencer and her sister, Beth, are gang raped; the attack leaves Beth in a catatonic state. Ten years later, Spencer kills George Wilburn, one of the rapists, in San Francisco and returns to her (fictional) hometown of San Paulo, looking for the remaining criminals. Meanwhile, Inspector Harry Callahan is frustrated when another judge dismisses a case due to his direct methods. At his favorite diner, Callahan foils a robbery, killing three criminals in the process. He later causes local crime lord Threlkis to suffer a fatal heart attack after threatening him with prosecution.

Unable to fire him because his methods &quot;get results&quot;, Callahan&#x27;s superiors instead order him to take a vacation. Four of Threlkis&#x27;s hitmen eventually attack him. Callahan takes down three, while the fourth escapes. Later, the suspect from the dismissed case and his friends throw Molotov cocktails into Callahan&#x27;s car. Acting in self-defense, he kills his attackers. To get Harry out of sight until the furor dies down, Callahan is sent to San Paulo.

Upon arrival, Callahan chases down a robber. The reckless but successful pursuit angers the San Paulo police. While jogging with his bulldog, Meathead, Callahan accidentally runs into Spencer. On returning to his room at a motel, he is targeted by the surviving Threlkis hitman, who is killed by Callahan. Meanwhile, Spencer kills Kruger, a second rapist. Callahan recognizes the &quot;modus operandi&quot;, but Lester Jannings, San Paulo&#x27;s police chief, refuses to work with him.

Callahan learns both victims are friends of Jannings&#x27; son, Alby. Ray Parkins, the female member of the gang of rapists, figures out they are being targeted, and warns the two remaining men, Tyrone and Mick. At an outdoor cafe, Callahan meets Spencer again. Over drinks, he learns that she shares his emphasis on results over methods when seeking justice, but he adds the caveat &quot;&#x27;til it breaks the law.&quot; Callahan reveals that he is investigating Wilburn&#x27;s murder, which rattles Spencer. Later, he finds Tyrone dead.

To be more protected, Mick stays with Parkins at her place. While visiting them for questioning, Mick attacks Callahan. After Callahan subdues Mick and takes him to the police station, Spencer guns down Parkins.

Callahan and Spencer meet again and sleep together. On his way back to the motel, Callahan notices her car, which he had seen earlier at Parkins&#x27; place. Returning there, he finds Parkins&#x27; body. Two of Mick&#x27;s friends bail him out of jail. Meanwhile, Callahan&#x27;s partner Horace arrives at the motel to celebrate the easing of tensions in San Francisco. He meets Mick and his henchmen, instead, who have been waiting to spring an ambush. Mick&#x27;s gang kills Horace and neuters Meathead with a switchblade. They then beat up Callahan before throwing him off a pier, presuming he will drown.

Spencer arrives at the Jannings home with the intention of killing Alby, another one of the rapists. To her surprise, Alby, like her sister, is catatonic; a guilty conscience caused him to attempt suicide, which left him with permanent brain damage. To protect his own reputation and his only child, Jannings refused to jail the guilty parties. He convinces Spencer to spare Alby&#x27;s life and promises Mick will be punished. Mick and his henchmen, however, arrive and capture Spencer, using her gun to kill Jannings.

Enraged at what happened to Horace and Meathead, Callahan goes after Mick&#x27;s gang with his .44 Automag. The gang brings Spencer to the boardwalk for another rape but are startled by Callahan&#x27;s apparent return from the dead. Callahan chases Mick after killing his henchmen. Mick drags Spencer to the top of a roller coaster, where she breaks free. Callahan shoots Mick, who falls from the top of the coaster, crashes through the glass roof of the carousel below, and is impaled on the horn of its unicorn.

Before the local cops arrive, Harry considers arresting Spencer. She, however, convinces him that her actions against the rapists were justified. The police arrive and find Spencer&#x27;s .38 on Mick. Ballistics, Callahan states, will prove that &quot;his gun … was used in all the killings.&quot; Callahan and a vindicated Spencer leave the crime scene together.

==Cast==
==Production==
The script was initially written by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith for a separate film for Locke, but was later adapted into a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film by Joseph Stinson. Filming occurred in spring 1983. Many of the film&#x27;s scenes were filmed in San Francisco and Santa Cruz, California. The scene where Harry chases a bank robber in the downtown business district offers a rare glimpse of the area before it was devastated by the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989. Footage for the robbery in &quot;Acorn Cafe&quot; was shot at Burger Island, later a McDonald&#x27;s and now the site of a hotel, at the corner of 3rd and Townsend in San Francisco. At this point in his career, Eastwood was receiving a salary that included 60% of all film profits, leaving the other 40% for the studio. Estimates had Eastwood earning $30 million for &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;.

It was Locke&#x27;s last film to be widely released. Perpetuating a career-long pattern that saw her playing protagonists much younger than herself, at 39, Locke was older than the group of actors cast as the rapists and 21 years older than the youth catcalling her near the start of the movie. She was six years older than Audrie Neenan, though the character of Parkins is clearly meant to be older than Spencer. Moreover, the actress who played Locke&#x27;s sister was 11½ years her junior.

==Reception==

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film took $9,688,561 in 1,530 theaters in the US. In total in the US and Canada, the film made $67,642,693, making it the highest grossing of the five films in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise. The film also surpassed the $63.6 million gross of &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965) to become the highest-grossing fourth installment of a film in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, it grossed more than $150 million.

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a score of 53% based on 40 reviews. The consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Sudden Impact&quot; delivers all the firepower – and the most enduring catchphrase – fans associate with the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise, but it&#x27;s far from the best film in the series.&quot;

Vincent Canby criticized the film, stating: &quot;The screenplay is ridiculous, and Mr. Eastwood&#x27;s direction of it primitive, which is surprising because he has shown himself capable in such films as &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; and &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;. Among other things, the movie never gets a firm hold on its own continuity. Sometimes scenes of simultaneous action appear to take place weeks or maybe months apart.&quot; Roger Ebert was more positive, awarding three stars out of four; while noting that the film was &quot;implausible&quot; with &quot;a cardboard villain&quot;, he also praised it as &quot;a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movie with only the good parts left in&quot; and &quot;a great audience picture.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted that &quot;everything is pitched for maximum action impact, so audiences should feel they got their money&#x27;s worth,&quot; but also thought that the action scenes put &quot;too much reliance on characters, particularly Harry, being in the right place at the right time.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that nothing in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; sequels &quot;has ever come close to the evil Scorpio in its portrayal of a bad guy. Because of that they are lesser films. We never feel that Harry is in any real danger.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; slammed the film as &quot;the exploitation picture at its most nakedly manipulative,&quot; which &quot;doesn&#x27;t just exploit sex and violence but also audience prejudices toward minorities. (True, Callahan&#x27;s partner, played by Albert Popwell, is black, but he&#x27;s around only briefly.) That it exploits with sleek cinematic skill—not to mention a great deal of righteousness—makes it all the more reprehensible.&quot; A negative review from Pauline Kael in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarked that the film &quot;might be mistaken for parody if the sledgehammer-slow pacing didn&#x27;t tell you that the director (Eastwood) wasn&#x27;t in on the joke.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Sudden Impact&quot; is best remembered for Harry&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot;. United States President Ronald Reagan used the &quot;make my day&quot; line in a March 1985 speech threatening to veto legislation raising taxes. When campaigning for office as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, in 1986, Eastwood used bumper stickers entitled &quot;Go Ahead — Make Me Mayor&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Harry Callahan: &quot;Go ahead, make my day.&quot; – #6

&quot;Make My Day&quot; is a novelty song recorded by American country music artist T. G. Sheppard featuring Clint Eastwood. It was released in February 1984 as the second single from the album &quot;Slow Burn&quot;. The song reached #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart. The song was written by Dewayne Blackwell.

<doc id="1179236" wikidata="Q774332" url="?curid=1179236" title="Gas cylinder">
<text>A gas cylinder is a pressure vessel for storage and containment of gases at above atmospheric pressure. Gas storage cylinders may also be called &quot;bottles&quot;. Inside the cylinder the stored contents may be in a state of compressed gas, vapor over liquid, supercritical fluid, or dissolved in a substrate material, depending on the physical characteristics of the contents. A typical gas cylinder design is elongated, standing upright on a flattened or dished bottom end or foot ring, with the cylinder valve screwed into the internal neck thread at the top for connecting to the filling or receiving apparatus.

== Nomenclature ==
Gas cylinders may be grouped by several characteristics, such as construction method, material, pressure group, class of contents, transportability, and re-usability.

The size of a pressurised gas container that may be classed as a gas cylinder is typically 0.5 litres to 150 litres. Smaller containers may be termed gas cartridges, and larger may be termed gas tubes, tanks, or other specific type of pressure vessel. A gas cylinder is used to store gas or liquefied gas at pressures above normal atmospheric pressure. In South Africa, a gas storage cylinder implies a refillable transportable container with a water capacity volume of up to 150 litres. Refillable transportable cylindrical containers from 150 to 3,000 litres water capacity are referred to as tubes.

In the United States, &quot;bottled gas&quot; typically refers to liquefied petroleum gas. &quot;Bottled gas&quot; is sometimes used in medical supply, especially for portable oxygen tanks. Packaged industrial gases are frequently called &quot;cylinder gas&quot;, though &quot;bottled gas&quot; is sometimes used. The term propane tank is also used for cylinders for propane.

The United Kingdom and other parts of Europe more commonly refer to &quot;bottled gas&quot; when discussing any usage, whether industrial, medical, or liquefied petroleum. In contrast, what is called liquefied petroleum gas in the United States is known generically in the United Kingdom as &quot;LPG&quot; and it may be ordered by using one of several trade names, or specifically as butane or propane, depending on the required heat output.

The term &quot;cylinder&quot; in this context is sometimes confused with &quot;tank&quot;, the latter being an open-top or vented container that stores liquids under gravity, though the term &quot;scuba tank&quot; is commonly used to refer to a compressed gas cylinder used for breathing gas supply to an underwater breathing apparatus.

===Components===
*Cylinder – Either the shell or the complete assembly of shell and all accessories directly attached to the shell, depending on context.
*Shell – The pressure vessel as a whole, excepting accessories.
**Shoulder – The end of the shell with a neck or boss into which the valve is fitted.
***Neck – A coaxial cylindrical extension of the shoulder with a threaded hole into which the cylinder valve or a gas pipe connection is fitted.
***Boss – A sturdy insert, usually in the centre of the shoulder, into which a valve or gas pipe connection is fitted.
**Base or foot – The end of the shell opposite the shoulder.
**Liner – The core on which filament windings are laid. The core may be structural (usually metal), and share the pressure loads, or purely to separate composite wrapping from the cylinder contents, (metal or engineering plastic).
*Cylinder valve – a shutoff valve directly coupled to the cylinder shell at the neck or boss which is opened to allow gas flow into or out of the cylinder, and closed to prevent such flow. It usually has a threaded inlet/outlet opening to which other equipment can be connected, but in some cases may have an integral pressure regulator on the outlet side, and a separate inlet opening for filling.
*Foot ring – A permanently attached ring fitted to the base on which the cylinder can stand.
*Valve guard – A fitting (cap or collar) screwed or clamped to the shoulder, defending the valve from impact during transport, and in some cases, when in use.
*Permanent markings – Information identifying the cylinder and its specification, stamped into the outside of the shoulder on metal cylinders. On composite cylinders permanent makings can be a printed label encapsulated under the resin or covered by a permanent transparent coating on the shoulder or side wall of the cylinder.

=== Types ===
Since fibre-composite materials have been used to reinforce pressure vessels, various types of cylinder distinguished by the construction method and materials used have been defined:

*Type 1: Metal only. Mostly seamless forged metal, but for lower working pressure, &quot;e.g.&quot;, liquefied butane, welded steel vessels are also used.
*Type 2: Metal vessel, hoop wrapped with a fibre composite only around the cylindrical part of the &quot;cylinder&quot;. (Geometrically there is a need for twice the tensile strength on the cylindrical region in comparison to the spherical caps of the cylinder.)
*Type 3: Thin metal liner (that keeps the vessel gas tight, but does not contribute to the strength) fully wrapped with fibre composite material.
*Type 4: Metal-free liner of plastic, fully wrapped with fibre composite material. The neck of the cylinder which includes the thread for the valve is a metal insert.

===Cylinder assemblies===
Assemblies comprising a group of cylinders mounted together for combined use or transport:
*Bank – A group of cylinders connected to a gas distribution system for bulk storage, where the individual cylinders may be used together or separately, but are not necessarily supported by a structure which can be used to transport them as a group. 
*Cascade – A bank when used in cascade.
*Quad or bundle, also occasionally gas pack or gas battery – A bank of high pressure gas storage cylinders, typically mounted upright on a rectangular frame for transport, and manifolded together. A pallet is a similar appearing group of cylinders on a lifting frame with no functional connections. The maximum combined cylinder volume for a bundle is 3000 litres for non-toxic gases and 1000 litres for toxic gases. Gas bundles are specified by ISO 10961:2019 Gas cylinders — Cylinder bundles — Design, manufacture, testing and inspection. 
*Rack – A structure to hold cylinders safely upright or horizontal while in use, for transport, or in storage.

== Materials ==
All-metal cylinders are the most rugged and usually the most economical option, but are relatively heavy. Steel is generally the most resistant to rough handling and most economical, and is often lighter than aluminium for the same working pressure, capacity, and form factor due to its higher specific strength. The inspection interval of industrial steel cylinders has increased from 5 or 6 years to 10 years. Diving cylinders that are used in water must be inspected more often; intervals tend to range between 1 and 5 years. Steel cylinders are typically withdrawn from service after 70 years, or may continue to be used indefinitely providing they pass periodic inspection and testing. When they were found to have inherent structural problems, certain steel and aluminium alloys were withdrawn from service, or discontinued from new production, while existing cylinders may require different inspection or testing, but remain in service provided they pass these tests.

For very high pressures, composites have a greater mass advantage. Due to the very high tensile strength of carbon fiber reinforced polymer, these vessels can be very light, but are more expensive to manufacture.
Filament wound composite cylinders are used in fire fighting breathing apparatus, high altitude climbing, and oxygen first aid equipment because of their low weight, but are rarely used for diving, due to their high positive buoyancy. They are occasionally used when portability for accessing the dive site is critical, such as in cave diving where the water surface is far from the cave entrance. Composite cylinders certified to ISO-11119-2 or ISO-11119-3 may only be used for underwater applications if they are manufactured in accordance with the requirements for underwater use and are marked &quot;UW&quot;.

Cylinders reinforced with or made from a fibre reinforced material usually must be inspected more frequently than metal cylinders, &quot;e.g.&quot;, every 5 instead of 10 years, and must be inspected more thoroughly than metal cylinders as they are more susceptible to impact damage. They may also have a limited service life. Fibre composite cylinders were originally specified for a limited life span of 15, 20 or 30 years, but this has been extended when they proved to be suitable for longer service.

==Manufacturing processes==

===Type 1 seamless metal cylinders===

The Type 1 pressure vessel is a seamless cylinder normally made of cold-extruded aluminum or forged steel. The pressure vessel comprises a cylindrical section of even wall thickness, with a thicker base at one end, and domed shoulder with a central neck to attach a cylinder valve or manifold at the other end.

Occasionally other materials may be used. Inconel has been used for non-magnetic and highly corrosion resistant oxygen compatible spherical high-pressure gas containers for the US Navy&#x27;s Mk-15 and Mk-16 mixed gas rebreathers, and a few other military rebreathers.

====Aluminium====
Most aluminum cylinders are flat bottomed, allowing them to stand upright on a level surface, but some were manufactured with domed bottoms. 

Aluminum cylinders are usually manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminum billets in a process which first presses the walls and base, then trims the top edge of the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings.

====Steel====

Steel cylinders are often used because they are harder and more resistant to external surface impact and abrasion damage, and can tolerate higher temperatures without affecting material properties. They also may have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher specific strength. Steel cylinders are more susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It is not difficult to monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.

Steel cylinders are manufactured with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile allows them to stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres (&quot;J&quot;). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba. Domed end industrial cylinders may be fitted with a press-fitted foot ring to allow upright standing.

Steel alloys used for gas cylinder manufacture are authorised by the manufacturing standard. For example, the US standard DOT 3AA requires the use of open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform quality. Approved alloys include 4130X, NE-8630, 9115, 9125, Carbon-boron and Intermediate manganese, with specified constituents, including manganese and carbon, and molybdenum, chromium, boron, nickel or zirconium.

=====Drawn from plate=====
Steel cylinders may be manufactured from steel plate discs stamped from annealed plate or coil, which are lubricated and cold drawn to a cylindrical cup form, by a hydraulic press, this is annealed and drawn again in two or three stages, until the final diameter and wall thickness is reached. They generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves.For industrial use a dished base allows the cylinder to stand on the end on a flat surface. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising and final inspection.

=====Spun from seamless tube=====
A related method is to start with seamless steel tube of a suitable diameter and wall thickness, manufactured by a process such as the Mannesmann process, and to close both ends by the hot spinning process. This method is particularly suited to high pressure gas storage tubes, which usually have a threaded neck opening at both ends, so that both ends are processed alike. When a neck opening is only required at one end, the base is spun first and dressed inside for a uniform smooth surface, then the process of closing the shoulder and forming the neck is the same as for the pressed plate method.

=====Forged from billet=====
An alternative production method is backward extrusion of a heated steel billet, similar to the cold extrusion process for aluminium cylinders, followed by hot drawing and bottom forming to reduce wall thickness, and trimming of the top edge in preparation for shoulder and neck formation by hot spinning. The other processes are much the same for all production methods.
=====Cylinder neck=====
The &quot;neck&quot; of the cylinder is the part of the end which is shaped as a narrow concentric cylinder, and internally threaded to fit a cylinder valve. There are several standards for neck threads, which include parallel threads where the seal is by an O-ring gasket, and taper threads which seal along the contact surface by deformation of the contact surfaces, and on thread tape or sealing compound.

====Type 2 hoop wrapped metal liner====
Type 2 is hoop wrapped with fibre reinforced resin over the cylindrical part of the cylinder, where circumferential load is highest. The fibres share the circumferential load with the metal core, and achieve a significant weight saving due to efficient stress distribution and high specific strength and stiffness of the composite. The core is a seamless metal cylinder, manufactured in any of the ways suitable for a type 1 cylinder, but with thinner walls, as they only carry about half the load, mainly the axial load. Hoop winding is at an angle to the length axis of close to 90°, so the fibres carry negligible axial load.

====Type 3 fully wrapped thin metal liner====
Type 3 is wrapped over the entire cylinder except for the neck, and the metal liner is mainly to make the cylinder gas tight, so very little load is carried by the liner. Winding angles are optimised to carry all the loads (axial and circumferential) from the pressurised gas in the cylinder. Only the neck metal is exposed on the outside. This construction can save in the order of 30% of the mass compared with type 2, as the fibre composite has a higher specific strength than the metal of the type 2 liner that it replaces.

====Type 4 fully wrapped plastic liner====
Type 4 is wrapped in the same way as type 3, but the liner is non-metallic. A metal neck boss is fitted to the shoulder of the plastic liner before winding, and this carries the neck threads for the cylinder valve. The outside of the neck of the insert is not covered by the fibre wrapping, and may have axial ridges to engage with a wrench or clamp for torsional support when fitting or removing the cylinder valve. There is a mass reduction compared with type 3 due to the lower density of the plastic liner.

====Welded gas cylinders====
A welded gas cylinder comprises two or more shell components joined by welding. The most commonly used material is steel, but stainless steel, aluminium and other alloys can be used when they are better suited to the application. Steel is strong, resistant to physical damage, easy to weld, relatively low cost, and usually adequate for corrosion resistance, and provides an economical product.

The components of the shell are usually domed ends, and often a rolled cylindrical centre section. The ends are usually domed by cold pressing from a circular blank, and may be drawn in two or more stages to get the final shape, which is generally semi-elliptical in section. The end blank is typically punched from sheet, drawn to the required section, edges trimmed to size and necked for overlap where appropriate, and hole(s) for the neck and other fittings punched. The neck boss is inserted from the concave side and welded in place before shell assembly. 

Smaller cylinders are typically assembled from a top and bottom dome, with an equatorial weld seam. Larger cylinders with a longer cylindrical body comprise dished ends circumferentially welded to a rolled central cylindrical section with a single longitudinal welded seam. Welding is typically automated gas metal arc welding.

Typical accessories which are welded to the outside of the cylinder include a foot ring, a valve guard with lifting handles, and a neck boss threaded for the valve. Occasionally other through-shell and external fittings are also welded on.

After welding, the assembly may be heat treated for stress-relief and to improve mechanical characteristics, cleaned by shotblasting, and coated with a protective and decorative coating. Testing and inspection for quality control will take place at various stages of production.

== Regulations and testing ==
The transportation of high-pressure cylinders is regulated by many governments throughout the world. Various levels of testing are generally required by the governing authority for the country in which it is to be transported while filled. In the United States, this authority is the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Similarly in the UK, the European transport regulations (ADR) are implemented by the Department for Transport (DfT). For Canada, this authority is Transport Canada (TC). Cylinders may have additional requirements placed on design and or performance from independent testing agencies such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL). Each manufacturer of high-pressure cylinders is required to have an independent quality agent that will inspect the product for quality and safety.

Within the UK the &quot;competent authority&quot; — the Department for Transport (DfT) — implements the regulations and appointment of authorised cylinder testers is conducted by United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), who make recommendations to the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) for approval of individual bodies.

There are a variety of tests that may be performed on various cylinders. Some of the most common types of tests are hydrostatic test, burst test, ultimate tensile strength, Charpy impact test and pressure cycling.

During the manufacturing process, vital information is usually stamped or permanently marked on the cylinder. This information usually includes the type of cylinder, the working or service pressure, the serial number, date of manufacture, the manufacture&#x27;s registered code and sometimes the test pressure. Other information may also be stamped, depending on the regulation requirements.

High-pressure cylinders that are used multiple times — as most are — can be hydrostatically or ultrasonically tested and visually examined every few years. In the United States, hydrostatic or ultrasonic testing is required either every five years or every ten years, depending on cylinder and its service.

== Valve connections ==
===Neck thread===

Cylinder neck thread can be to any one of several standards. Both taper thread sealed with thread tape and parallel thread sealed with an O-ring have been found satisfactory for high pressure service, but each has advantages and disadvantages for specific use cases, and if there are no regulatory requirements, the type may be chosen to suit the application.

A tapered thread provides simple assembly, but requires high torque for establishing a reliable seal, which causes high radial forces in the neck, and has a limited number of times it can be used before it is excessively deformed. This can be extended a bit by always returning the same fitting to the same cylinder, and avoiding over-tightening.

In Australia, Europe and North America, tapered neck threads are generally preferred for inert, flammable, corrosive and toxic gases, but when aluminium cylinders are used for oxygen service to United States Department of Transportation (DOT) or Transport Canada (TC) specifications in North America, the cylinders must have parallel thread. DOT and TC allow UN pressure vessels to have tapered or parallel threaded openings. In the US, 49 CFR Part 171.11 applies, and in Canada, CSA B340-18 and CSA B341-18. In Europe and other parts of the world, tapered thread is preferred for cylinder inlets for oxidising gases.

Scuba cylinders typically have a much shorter interval between internal inspections, so the use of tapered thread is less satisfactory due to the limited number of times a tapered thread valve can be re-used before it wears out, so parallel thread is generally used for this application.

Parallel thread can be tightened sufficiently to form a good seal with the O-ring without lubrication, which is an advantage when the lubricant may react with the O-ring or the contents. Repeated secure installations are possible with different combinations of valve and cylinder provided they have compatible thread and correct O-ring seals. Parallel thread is more likely to give the technician warning of residual internal pressure by leaking or extruding the O-ring before catastrophic failure when the O-ring seal is broken during removal of the valve. The O-ring size must be correct for the combination of cylinder and valve, and the material must be compatible with the contents and any lubricant used.

=== Valve ===
Gas cylinders usually have an angle stop valve at one end, and the cylinder is usually oriented so the valve is on top. During storage, transportation, and handling when the gas is not in use, a cap may be screwed over the protruding valve to protect it from damage or breaking off in case the cylinder were to fall over. Instead of a cap, cylinders sometimes have a protective collar or neck ring around the valve assembly which has an opening for access to fit a regulator or other fitting to the valve outlet, and access to operate the valve. Installation of valves for high pressure aluminum alloy cylinders is described in the guidelines: CGA V-11, Guideline for the Installation of Valves into High Pressure Aluminum Alloy Cylinders and ISO 13341, Transportable gas cylinders—Fitting of valves to gas cylinders.

=== Connection ===
The valves on industrial, medical and diving cylinders usually have threads or connection geometries of different handedness, sizes and types that depend on the category of gas, making it more difficult to mistakenly misuse a gas. For example, a hydrogen cylinder valve outlet does not fit an oxygen regulator and supply line, which could result in catastrophe. Some fittings use a right-hand thread, while others use a left-hand thread; left-hand thread fittings are usually identifiable by notches or grooves cut into them, and are usually used for flammable gases.

In the United States, valve connections are sometimes referred to as &quot;CGA connections&quot;, since the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) publishes guidelines on what connections to use for what gasses. For example, an argon cylinder may have a &quot;CGA 580&quot; connection on the valve. High purity gases sometimes use CGA-DISS (&quot;Diameter Index Safety System&quot;) connections.

Medical gases may use the Pin Index Safety System to prevent incorrect connection of gases to services.

In the European Union, DIN connections are more common than in the United States.

In the UK, the British Standards Institution sets the standards. Included among the standards is the use left-hand threaded valves for flammable gas cylinders (most commonly brass, BS4, valves for non-corrosive cylinder contents or stainless steel, BS15, valves for corrosive contents). Non flammable gas cylinders are fitted with right-hand threaded valves (most commonly brass, BS3, valves for non-corrosive components or stainless steel, BS14, valves for corrosive contents).

=== Regulator ===
When the gas in the cylinder is to be used at low pressure, the cap is taken off and a pressure-regulating assembly is attached to the stop valve. This attachment typically has a pressure regulator with upstream (inlet) and downstream (outlet) pressure gauges and a further downstream needle valve and outlet connection. For gases that remain gaseous under ambient storage conditions, the upstream pressure gauge can be used to estimate how much gas is left in the cylinder according to pressure. For gases that are liquid under storage, e.g., propane, the outlet pressure is dependent on the vapor pressure of the gas, and does not fall until the cylinder is nearly exhausted, although it will vary according to the temperature of the cylinder contents. The regulator is adjusted to control the downstream pressure, which will limit the maximum flow of gas out of the cylinder at the pressure shown by the downstream gauge. For some purposes, such as shielding gas for arc welding, the regulator will also have a flowmeter on the downstream side.

The regulator outlet connection is attached to whatever needs the gas supply.

== Safety and standards ==

Because the contents are under pressure and are sometimes hazardous materials, handling bottled gases is regulated. Regulations may include chaining bottles to prevent falling and damaging the valve, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards. If a compressed gas cylinder falls over, causing the valve block to be sheared off, the rapid release of high-pressure gas may cause the cylinder to be violently accelerated, potentially causing property damage, injury, or death. To prevent this, cylinders are normally secured to a fixed object or transport cart with a strap or chain. They can also be stored in a safety cabinet.

In a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its temperature. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically. If the vessel contents are flammable, this event may result in a &quot;fireball&quot;. Oxidisers such as oxygen and fluorine will produce a similar effect by accelerating combustion in the area affected. If the cylinder&#x27;s contents are liquid, but become a gas at ambient conditions, this is commonly referred to as a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE).

Medical gas cylinders in the UK and some other countries have a fusible plug of Wood&#x27;s metal in the valve block between the valve seat and the cylinder. This plug melts at a comparatively low temperature (70 °C) and allows the contents of the cylinder to escape to the surroundings before the cylinder is significantly weakened by the heat, lessening the risk of explosion.

More common pressure relief devices are a simple burst disc installed in the base of the valve between the cylinder and the valve seat. A burst disc is a small metal gasket engineered to rupture at a pre-determined pressure. Some burst discs are backed with a low-melting-point metal, so that the valve must be exposed to excessive heat before the burst disc can rupture.

The Compressed Gas Association publishes a number of booklets and pamphlets on safe handling and use of bottled gases.

=== International and national standards ===

There is a wide range of standards relating to the manufacture, use and testing of pressurised gas cylinders and related components. Some examples are listed here.

=== Color coding ===

Gas cylinders are often color-coded, but the codes are not standard across different jurisdictions, and sometimes are not regulated. Cylinder color can not safely be used for positive product identification; cylinders have labels to identify the gas they contain.

==== Medical gas cylinder color code Indian standard ====
The Indian Standard for Gas Cylinder Color Code applies to the identification of the contents of gas cylinders intended for medical use. Each cylinder shall be painted externally in the colours corresponding to its gaseous contents.

== Common sizes ==
The below are example cylinder sizes and do not constitute an industry standard.
(US DOT specs define material, making, and maximum pressure in psi. They are comparable to Transport Canada specs, which shows pressure in bars. A 3E-1800 in DOT nomenclature would be a TC 3EM 124 in Canada.)

== Gas storage tubes ==

For larger volume, high pressure gas storage units, known as &quot;tubes&quot;, are available. They generally have a larger diameter and length than high pressure cylinders, and usually have a tapped neck at both ends. They may be mounted alone or in groups on trailers, permanent bases, or intermodal transport frames. Due to their length, they are mounted horizontally on mobile structures. In general usage they are often manifolded together and managed as a unit.

== Gas storage banks ==
Groups of similar size cylinders may be mounted together and connected to a common manifold system to provide larger storage capacity than a single standard cylinder. This is commonly called a cylinder bank or a gas storage bank. The manifold may be arranged to allow simultaneous flow from all the cylinders, or, for a cascade filling system, where gas is tapped off cylinders according to the lowest positive pressure difference between storage and destination cylinder, being a more efficient use of pressurised gas.

=== Gas storage quads ===
A gas cylinder quad, also known as a gas cylinder bundle, is a group of high pressure cylinders mounted on a transport and storage frame. There are commonly 16 cylinders, each of about 50 litres capacity mounted upright in four rows of four, on a square base with a square plan frame with lifting points on top and may have fork-lift slots in the base. The cylinders are usually interconnected by a manifold for use as a unit, but many variations in layout and structure are possible.

<doc id="1179238" wikidata="Q503698" url="?curid=1179238" title="Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor">
<text>Andrew Frederick Weatherby (Anthony) Beauchamp-Proctor, (4 September 1894 – 21 June 1921) was a South African airman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was South Africa&#x27;s leading ace of the First World War, being credited with 54 aerial victories.

==Early life==

Beauchamp-Proctor was born 4 September 1894 in Mossel Bay, Cape Colony, the second son of a school teacher. He attended the oldest school in the country, South African College Schools, Cape Town, where he was a resident of the oldest residence in the country, College House Residence (where his father was warden). He was studying engineering at University of Cape Town when the European war broke out. He took leave from his studies to join the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Rifles. He served as a signalman in the German South-West Africa campaign.

In August 1915, he was demobilised with an honorable discharge. He promptly went to work with the South African Field Telegraph and re-enrolled in university. He managed to complete his third year of college before re-enlisting, this time with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), in March 1917.

He was accepted as an Air Mechanic Third Class. From there, he passed on to pilot training at the School of Military Aeronautics at Oxford in England, where he was also commissioned. He managed to learn to fly despite his wiry stature of . His aircraft was altered to accommodate him; his seat was raised so he could have a better view from the cockpit and so he could reach controls. Blocks of wood were also fastened on his rudder bar so he could reach it.

On 10 June 1917, he soloed after just over five hours&#x27; flying time. He crashed upon landing, wiping out the landing gear. Nevertheless, he continued to fly solo. He was passed on to a bomber squadron, Number 84, with a little under ten hours&#x27; flying experience. When he joined 84 Squadron in July 1917, it was re-forming as a fighter squadron.

==France 1917–18==
On 23 September 1917, the unit went to France flying SE5s. Under the command of Major William Sholto Douglas, the unit became one of the most effective scout squadrons in the RFC/RAF (Royal Air Force) during 1918. The squadron would be credited with a victory total of 323, and would produce 25 aces. However, Beauchamp-Proctor would be pre-eminent, with almost triple the number of successes of the second leading ace. He was not particularly esteemed as a flier, but was a deadly shot.

Beauchamp-Proctor&#x27;s piloting skills can be judged by the fact he had three landing accidents before he ever shot down an enemy plane. He continued to fly the SE5 with the aforementioned modifications to the aircraft&#x27;s seat and controls, something his Philadelphia-born American squadron mate, Joseph &quot;Child Yank&quot; Boudwin, who stood only two inches taller and who would himself eventually be posted to the USAAS&#x27;s S.E. 5a-equipped 25th Aero Squadron just days before the Armistice, also had to use. The alterations to relatively primitive controls could have contributed to Beauchamp-Proctor&#x27;s poor airmanship.

His initial confirmed victory did not come until the turn of the year. On 3 January 1918, he sent a German two-seater &#x27;down out of control&#x27;. He then claimed four more victories in February, becoming an ace on the final day of the month. Only one of his five victories resulted in the destruction of an enemy; the others were planes sent down as &#x27;out of control&#x27;.

March brought four more victories; three of them were scored within five minutes on 17 March. He tallied one victory in April.

Among his 11 victories for the month of May were five on 19 May. On that morning, he knocked an enemy observation plane out of the battle; fifteen minutes later, he destroyed an Albatros D.V scout. That evening, at about 6:35 PM, he downed three more Albatros D.Vs. By 31 May, his roll had climbed to 21 victims—16 fighters and five observation aircraft. By this point, he had destroyed six enemy planes single-handed, and shared the destruction of two others. He drove ten down out of control, and shared in another &#x27;out of control&#x27; victory. Two of his victims were captured. Certainly a creditable record, and like many other aces, with no conquests over balloons.

The next day marked a change of focus for him; he shot down an observation balloon. Balloons, guarded by anti-aircraft artillery and patrolling fighter airplanes, were very dangerous targets. Commonly they were hunted by co-ordinated packs of fighters. For the remainder of his career, he would choose to try to blind the enemy by concentrating on shooting down kite balloons and observation aircraft. Also notable is the drop in his &quot;out of control&quot; victories; from here on out, the record shows destruction after destruction of the enemy. His June string would only run to 13 June, but in that time, he would destroy four balloons, an observation two-seater and a fighter. Only one fighter went down out of control. On 22 June, he was awarded the Military Cross.

July would pass without incident. On 3 August, he was granted one of the first ever Distinguished Flying Crosses.

The break in his victory string lasted almost a month, as he went on home leave and helped a recruitment drive for the RAF. On 8 August, he returned and resumed with tally number 29, another balloon. On 9 August, Beauchamp-Proctor was leading No. 84 Squadron on a patrol over their base at Bertangles, with Boudwin and six-foot-four tall, fellow South African Hugh Saunders as wingmen. The threesome got involved in a heated engagement at 2:00 pm, that involved them in combat against Fokker D.VII fighters of JG I, led that day by the future Nazi &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring. Unsuccessful at increasing his total that day, Beauchamp-Proctor would claim an additional 14 aircraft, and end the month with his claims list extended to 43. One memorable day was 22 August; he attacked a line of six enemy balloon over the British 3rd Corps front. He set the first one afire with his machine guns and forced the other five to the ground, the observers taking to their parachutes. His 15 victories for August would include five balloons, all destroyed, and two more two-seater planes. He was now up to 43 victories.

His September claims would be all balloons—four of them.

In the first few days of October, he would destroy three more balloons and three Fokker D.VII fighters, one of which burned. Another D.VII spun down out of control.

On 8 October, he was hit by ground fire and wounded in the arm, ending his front line service.

Beauchamp-Proctor&#x27;s victory total was 54; two (and one shared) captured enemy aircraft, 13 (and three shared) balloons destroyed, 15 (and one shared) aircraft destroyed, and 15 (and one shared) aircraft &#x27;out of control&#x27;. His 16 balloons downed made him the leading British Empire balloon buster.

On 2 November, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, followed by the Victoria Cross on 30 November. He scored all of his 54 victories in the SE5, becoming the most successful pilot in the type.

==Post-war==

He was discharged from hospital in March 1919 and embarked on a four-month-long lecture tour of the US, before returning to England and qualifying as a seaplane pilot with a permanent commission as a flight lieutenant in the RAF.

After his VC investiture at Buckingham Palace in November 1919 he was awarded a year&#x27;s leave, and this enabled him finish his BSc degree in Engineering.

==Death==
Beauchamp-Proctor was killed on 21 June 1921 in a training accident flying a Sopwith Snipe, in preparation for an air show at the RAF Hendon. His aircraft went into a vicious spin after performing a slow loop, and he was killed in the ensuing crash. At least one observer remarked that the loss of control and subsequent crash of the aircraft could have been linked to Proctor&#x27;s diminutive size.

He was originally buried at Upavon, Wiltshire, but in August 1921 his body was returned to South Africa where he was given a state funeral.

There still exists confusion over Beauchamp-Proctor&#x27;s given name. For decades he was listed as &quot;Anthony&quot; but more recent scholarship indicates &quot;Andrew&quot;, which is the name on his tombstone, and on is VC citation.

<text>Squadron Leader Arthur Stewart King Scarf, VC (14 June 1913 – 9 December 1941) was a Royal Air Force pilot and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the only member of the RAF to be awarded the VC for his actions in the Pacific War.

==Early life and career==
Scarf attended King&#x27;s College School in Wimbledon, and was a RAF Cranwell trained regular. Scarf joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1936, and was accepted for pilot training. On gaining his wings he was posted to No. 9 Squadron, operating the Handley Page Heyford. In 1937 he transferred to No. 62 Squadron, a light bomber unit which received the Bristol Blenheim in February 1938. Just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the squadron was detached to bases in northern Malaya. From July 1941, No. 62 Squadron was based at Alor Star near the Thailand border and at the outbreak of hostilities with Japan in December 1941 the squadron came under heavy air attack. On 9 December it was withdrawn to RAF Butterworth in order to regroup.

==Raid on Singora==
Scarf was 28 years old, and a squadron leader in No. 62 Squadron, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 9 December 1941 in Malaya, near the Thailand border, all available aircraft had been ordered to make a daylight raid on Singora (where the Imperial Japanese Army was invading). Squadron Leader Scarf, as leader of the raid, had just taken off from the base at Butterworth when enemy aircraft swept in destroying or disabling all the rest of the machines. Scarf decided nevertheless to fly alone to Singora. Despite attacks from roving fighters he completed his bombing run and was on his way back when his aircraft became riddled with bullets and he was severely wounded, his left arm had been shattered, he had a large hole in his back and was drifting in and out of consciousness. He managed to crash-land the Blenheim at Alor Star, without causing any injury to his crew, and was rushed to hospital where he died two hours later.

Scarf&#x27;s Victoria Cross was not gazetted until June 1946. Because of the chaotic nature of the Malayan campaign, the facts concerning Scarf&#x27;s actions were not known until after the war. At the time of his death he was about to become a father for the first time. His pregnant wife was a nurse based at the Alor Star hospital, but had just been evacuated south. The two other crewmen from Scarf&#x27;s Blenheim were also given awards after the war for their courage during this action; Sergeant (later Squadron Leader) Paddy Calder was awarded a Distinguished Flying Medal and Sergeant Cyril Rich (killed in action in 1943) received a posthumous Mention in Despatches.

Squadron Leader Scarf (Service Number 37693) is buried in Grave 14, Row G, Section 2 of Taiping War Cemetery, Malaysia.

Scarf&#x27;s Victoria Cross was displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum London, England. On 27 April 2022, the recipient&#x27;s family placed the medal up for auction at Spink. It reportedly sold for a world record price of £682,000. On May 1, 2023, the RAF museum announced they had raised the funds to keep the Victoria Cross and medal bar and they will go on display in the museum.

<text>Wing Commander Roderick Alastair Brook Learoyd, VC (5 February 1913 – 24 January 1996) was a Royal Air Force bomber pilot and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Folkestone on 5 February 1913 and educated at Hydneye House Preparatory School, Baldslow, Sussex, and Wellington College, Berkshire, Learoyd then attended the Chelsea College of Aeronautical and Automobile Engineering. Learoyd lived in Argentina for two years as a farmer.

==RAF career==
Learoyd decided to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was accepted in March 1936. He took a short service commission and was commissioned as an acting pilot officer on 18 May 1936. He was posted to No. 49 Squadron, Bomber Command equipped with Hawker Hinds at RAF Worthy Down, and was regraded and confirmed as a pilot officer on 23 March 1937. In March 1938, No. 49 Squadron moved to Scampton and became the first RAF squadron to re-equip with the new Handley Page Hampden bomber. Learoyd was promoted to flying officer on 23 December 1938.

On 3 September 1939, two days after the outbreak of the Second World War, six Hampdens from No. 83 Squadron and three from No. 49 Squadron (including Learoyd) left Scampton on an &quot;armed reconnaissance&quot; sortie over the North Sea. During the next ten months Learoyd participated in 23 more bombing sorties, and was an acting flight lieutenant when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC, gazetted on 20 August 1940.

On 12 August 1940 eleven Hampdens – six from No. 49 Squadron, five from No. 83 Squadron – were detailed to destroy the old aqueduct carrying the canal over the river Ems, north of Münster. Flight Lieutenant Learoyd was one of the pilots briefed to bomb. Learoyd was detailed as pilot of Hampden P4403, &quot;EA-M&quot;, and his crew comprised Pilot Officer John Lewis (Observer), Sergeant Walter Ellis (wireless operator-gunner) and Leading Aircraftman William Rich (ventral gunner).

Of the other Hampdens that made the attack that night, two were destroyed and two more were badly hit. Flight Lieutenant Learoyd took his plane into the target at only 150 feet, in the full glare of the searchlights and flak barrage all round him. After commencing its bombing run Learoyd&#x27;s aircraft was badly damaged, including a ruptured hydraulic system, resulting in inoperable wing flaps and a useless undercarriage. Wing damage, though serious, had fortunately missed the wing petrol tanks. Despite this damage the bombs were duly dropped and Learoyd managed to get his crippled plane back to England where he decided that a night landing would be too dangerous for his crippled aircraft and so circled base until first light, finally safely landing without causing injury to his crew or further damage to his aircraft.

The Victoria Cross was awarded at an investiture on 9 September 1940, by which time Learoyd, taken off operations and promoted to substantive flight lieutenant, was acting temporarily as personal assistant to Air Chief Marshal Sir Sir Robert Brooke-Popham.

===Victoria Cross citation===

The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 20 August 1940, reading:
==Later career==
Learoyd was promoted to squadron leader by 1942. He served in No. 44 Squadron for the remainder of the war. After surviving the war, Learoyd returned to civilian life, first as a VIP pilot and later as an export sales manager in the motor industry. He remained in the RAF reserves until 9 February 1958, when he retired with the rank of wing commander. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>RS-485, also known as TIA-485(-A) or EIA-485, is a standard, originally introduced in 1983, defining the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial communications systems. Electrical signaling is balanced, and multipoint systems are supported. The standard is jointly published by the Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries Alliance (TIA/EIA). Digital communications networks implementing the standard can be used effectively over long distances and in electrically noisy environments. Multiple receivers may be connected to such a network in a linear, multidrop bus. These characteristics make RS-485 useful in industrial control systems and similar applications.

== Overview ==
RS-485 supports inexpensive local networks and multidrop communications links, using the same differential signaling over twisted pair as RS-422. It is generally accepted that RS-485 can be used with data rates up to 10 Mbit/s or, at lower speeds, distances up to . As a rule of thumb, the speed in bit/s multiplied by the length in meters should not exceed 108. Thus a cable should not signal faster than .

In contrast to RS-422, which has a driver circuit which cannot be switched off, RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. This allows RS-485 to implement linear bus topologies using only two wires. The equipment located along a set of RS-485 wires are interchangeably called nodes, stations or devices. The recommended arrangement of the wires is as a connected series of point-to-point (multidropped) nodes, i.e. a line or bus, not a star, ring, or multiply connected network. Star and ring topologies are not recommended because of signal reflections or excessively low or high termination impedance. If a star configuration is unavoidable, special RS-485 repeaters are available which bidirectionally listen for data on each span and then retransmit the data onto all other spans.
Ideally, the two ends of the cable will have a termination resistor connected across the two wires. Without termination resistors, signal reflections off the unterminated end of the cable can cause data corruption. Termination resistors also reduce electrical noise sensitivity due to the lower impedance. The value of each termination resistor should be equal to the cable characteristic impedance (typically, 120 ohms for twisted pairs). The termination also includes pull up and pull down resistors to establish bias for each data wire for the case when the lines are not being driven by any device. This way, the lines will be biased to known voltages and nodes will not interpret the noise from undriven lines as actual data; without biasing resistors, the data lines float in such a way that electrical noise sensitivity is greatest when all device stations are silent or unpowered.

== Standard ==
The EIA once labeled all its standards with the prefix RS (Recommended Standard), but the EIA/TIA officially replaced RS with EIA/TIA to help identify the origin of its standards. The EIA has officially disbanded and the standard is now maintained by the TIA as TIA-485, but engineers and applications guides continue to use the RS-485 designation. The initial edition of EIA RS-485 was dated April 1983.

RS-485 only specifies the electrical characteristics of the generator and the receiver: the physical layer. It does not specify or recommend any communications protocol; Other standards define the protocols for communication over an RS-485 link. The foreword to the standard references &quot;The Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB-89&quot; which contains application guidelines, including data signaling rate vs. cable length, stub length, and configurations.

Section 4 defines the electrical characteristics of the generator (transmitter or driver), receiver, transceiver, and system. These characteristics include: definition of a unit load, voltage ranges, open-circuit voltages, thresholds, and transient tolerance. It also defines three generator interface points (signal lines); A, B and C. The data is transmitted on A and B. C is a ground reference. This section also defines the logic states 1 (off) and 0 (on), by the polarity between A and B terminals. If A is negative with respect to B, the state is binary 1. The reversed polarity (A positive with respect to B) is binary 0. The standard does not assign any logic function to the two states.

== Full duplex operation ==
RS-485, like RS-422, can be made full-duplex by using four wires. Since RS-485 is a multi-point specification, however, this is not necessary or desirable in many cases. RS-485 and RS-422 can interoperate with certain restrictions.

== Converters, repeaters and star topology ==
Converters between RS-485 and RS-232 are available to allow a personal computer to communicate with remote devices. By using repeaters very large RS-485 networks can be formed. TSB-89A, Application Guidelines for TIA/EIA-485-A does not recommend using star topology.

== Applications ==
RS-485 signals are used in a wide range of computer and automation systems. In a computer system, SCSI-2 and SCSI-3 may use this specification to implement the physical layer for data transmission between a controller and a disk drive. RS-485 is used for low-speed data communications in commercial aircraft cabins&#x27; vehicle bus. It requires minimal wiring and can share the wiring among several seats, reducing weight.

These are used in programmable logic controllers and on factory floors. RS-485 is used as the physical layer underlying many standard and proprietary automation protocols used to implement industrial control systems, including the most common versions of Modbus and Profibus. is a proprietary communications protocol used by Allen-Bradley in their line of industrial control units. Utilizing a series of dedicated interface devices, it allows PCs and industrial controllers to communicate. Since it is differential, it resists electromagnetic interference from motors and welding equipment.

In theatre and performance venues, RS-485 networks are used to control lighting and other systems using the DMX512 protocol. RS-485 serves as a physical layer for the AES3 digital audio interconnect.

RS-485 is also used in building automation as the simple bus wiring and long cable length is ideal for joining remote devices. It may be used to control video surveillance systems or to interconnect security control panels and devices such as access control card readers.

It is also used in Digital Command Control (DCC) for model railways. The external interface to the DCC command station is often RS-485 used by hand-held controllers or for controlling the layout in a networked PC environment. 8P8C modular connectors are used in this case.

== Protocols ==
RS-485 does not define a communication protocol; merely an electrical interface. Although many applications use RS-485 signal levels, the speed, format, and protocol of the data transmission are not specified by RS-485. Interoperability of even similar devices from different manufacturers is not assured by compliance with the signal levels alone.

== Signals ==

The RS-485 differential line consists of two signals:
* A, which is low for logic 1 and high for logic 0 and,
* B, which is high for logic 1 and low for logic 0.

Because a mark (logic 1) condition is traditionally represented (e.g. in RS-232) with a negative voltage; and space (logic 0) represented with a positive one, A may be considered the &quot;non-inverting&quot; signal and B as inverting. The RS-485 standard states (paraphrased):
* For an off, mark or logic 1 state, the driver&#x27;s A terminal is negative relative to the B terminal.
* For an on, space or logic 0 state, the driver&#x27;s A terminal is positive relative to the B terminal.

The truth tables of most popular devices, starting with the SN75176, show the output signals inverted. This is in accordance with the A/B naming used by most differential transceiver manufacturers, including:
* Intersil, as seen in their data sheet for the ISL4489 transceiver
* Maxim, as seen in their data sheet for the MAX483 transceiver and for the new generation 3.3v micro controller the MAX3485
* Linear Technology, as seen in their datasheet for the LTC2850, LTC2851, LTC2852
* Analog Devices, as seen in their datasheet for the ADM3483, ADM3485, ADM3488, ADM3490, ADM3491
* FTDI, as seen in their datasheet for the USB-RS485-WE-1800-BT
These manufacturers all agree on the meaning of the standard, and their practice is in widespread use. The issue also exists in programmable logic controller applications. Care must be taken when using A/B naming. Alternate nomenclature is often used to avoid confusion surrounding the A/B naming:
* TX+/RX+ or D+ as alternative for B (high for mark i.e. idle)
* TX−/RX− or D− as alternative for A (low for mark i.e. idle)

RS-485 standard conformant drivers provide a differential output of a minimum 1.5 V across a 54-Ω load,
whereas standard conformant receivers detect a differential input down to 200 mV. The two values provide
a sufficient margin for a reliable data transmission even under severe signal degradation across the cable
and connectors. This robustness is the main reason why RS-485 is well suited for long-distance
networking in noisy environment.

In addition to the A and B connections, an optional, third connection may be present (the TIA standard requires the presence of a common return path between all circuit grounds along the balanced line for proper operation) called SC, G or reference, the common signal reference ground used by the receiver to measure the A and B voltages. This connection may be used to limit the common-mode signal that can be impressed on the receiver inputs. The allowable common-mode voltage is in the range −7 V to +12 V, i.e. ±7 V on top of the 0–5 V signal range. Failure to stay within this range will result in, at best, signal corruption, and, at worst, damage to connected devices. 

Care must be taken that an SC connection, especially over long cable runs, does not result in an attempt to connect disparate grounds together – it is wise to add some current limiting to the SC connection. Grounds between buildings may vary by a small voltage, but with very low impedance and hence the possibility of catastrophic currents – enough to melt signal cables, PCB traces, and transceiver devices.

RS-485 does not specify any connector or pinout. Circuits may be terminated on screw terminals, D-subminiature connectors, or other types of connectors.

The standard does not discuss cable shielding but makes some recommendations on preferred methods of interconnecting the signal reference common and equipment case grounds.

<doc id="1179250" wikidata="Q5523067" url="?curid=1179250" title="Garfield Goose and Friends">
<text>Garfield Goose and Friends is a children&#x27;s television show produced by WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, United States, from 1955 to 1976. The show was known as &quot;Garfield Goose and Friend&quot; from 1952 to 1955 when it aired on WBKB and WBBM-TV. It was the longest running puppet show on television until &quot;Sesame Street&quot; broke that record. The host of the show was Frazier Thomas, who did all of the talking. The show centered on a clacking goose puppet named Garfield Goose, who considered himself &quot;King of the United States.&quot; There were many other puppet characters such as Romberg Rabbit, Macintosh Mouse, Chris Goose (Garfield&#x27;s nephew who was born on Christmas, hence &quot;Christmas Goose&quot;) and a sleepy bloodhound called Beauregard Burnside III (whose name happened to be a mix of two American Civil War generals). The show used a &quot;Little Theater Screen&quot;, upon which the camera would zoom before cartoons such as Total Television, &quot;The Funny Company&quot;, &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, Jay Ward, Hanna-Barbera, &quot;Space Angel&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Hercules&quot; were broadcast.

==History==

===Cincinnati===
Thomas created Garfield Goose for a local television program he hosted in Cincinnati. Thomas, who was an Indiana native and had worked on Cincinnati local radio since before World War II, said he got the idea when he saw Catholic nuns with a sock puppet in the form of a goose, with which they invited children to &quot;feed the goose&quot; with donations for charity. He wanted to do something special to award prizes to children on his television show, so he created a Garfield Goose puppet for that purpose. &quot;Garfield&quot; was the television station&#x27;s telephone exchange. In Cincinnati, Garfield Goose lived in a cuckoo clock, since he had always wanted to be a cuckoo bird.

===Chicago and WBKB===

In 1951 Thomas and Garfield Goose moved to Chicago and CBS affiliate WBKB-TV, which was then on Channel 4. At first, the goose was a character on &quot;Petticoat Party&quot;, a variety show hosted by Thomas. Later, when the character was thought to have enough appeal for a show of its own, &quot;Garfield Goose and Friend&quot; debuted on September 29, 1952 with Chicago puppeteer Bruce Newton. The actual first puppeteer for Garfield was a WBKB secretary, Lee Ann Prineas, who left her clerical duties while the show was on the air. The show aired directly opposite NBC&#x27;s &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. In early broadcasts, Thomas hosted the show in a suit and tie, but on October 16, 1952, Garfield appointed him Admiral of his navy and his Prime Minister. making it necessary for Thomas to wear the uniform he is most remembered in. The uniform is now part of the Museum of Broadcast Communications collection.

At the time the show began, the American Federation of Radio Artists union began to recognize those working in television, becoming the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. This made it necessary for television performers to become members of the union and to receive at least union scale wages for their work, which was above current station salaries in many cases. Those who appeared on camera or who had voice roles were now subject to union regulations. The television station indicated that it was only willing to pay a union-scale wage for one performer on the Garfield Goose program. This obviously was Frazier Thomas, and it meant that any role played by Bruce Newton would be paid as non-union scale; he had to stay off-camera and could not speak.

Newton had Garfield Goose communicate with Thomas through an off-screen typewriter but Newton was soon replaced by Roy Brown; Brown later created the rest of the show&#x27;s puppet characters. Newton&#x27;s own account in an interview for &quot;The Golden Age of Chicago Children&#x27;s Television&quot; has him quitting the show and suggesting Thomas contact the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts for a replacement. Thomas did just that and became connected with Roy Brown in this way.

Roy Brown became the graphic artist for the show; he and Thomas quickly redesigned the Garfield puppet. Although Brown was still an art student and had no previous experience as a puppeteer when Thomas hired him for the show, Brown&#x27;s talents for this type of work were quickly visible. Years after the program had left the air, Brown talked about his time working with Thomas, whom he described as a perfectionist. During those years of working together, Thomas granted Brown the ability to be creative with the show&#x27;s characters; Brown discovered a slight hand movement which made it appear as if Garfield Goose was smiling. Thomas was able to converse with the show&#x27;s characters as if they were friends or neighbors, and to talk with his young audience without talking down to them. It was the working chemistry between the two men which made the show memorable and allowed it to become the longest-running puppet show on television.

The program was popular enough with Chicago area children in 1953 to inspire Frazier Thomas and Roy Brown to collaborate for a book, &quot;Garfield Goose Memory Book&quot;, with Thomas writing the story of Garfield Goose and Brown doing the illustrations for it. In it, Thomas detailed information such as the names of Garfield&#x27;s parents, Georgia (born in the state), and Godfrey, that he had a sister, Gloria, a brother in law, Gilbert, and a young nephew, Christmas. This branch of the Goose family spent summers in Goosejaw, Saskatchewan, and wintered in Goose Bay, Florida. Thomas and Brown also provided a picture of Garfield&#x27;s average day in his castle along with information about his younger years. The book was also able to be used as a coloring book.

The first addition to the cast came when the show was just over a year old. The storyline was that Garfield had hired a butler without the knowledge of Frazier, who learned of it through a phone call from the employment agency. He arrived on Thanksgiving Day 1953, and was a capuchin monkey named Geronimo. Geronimo was with the show even after it moved to WGN-TV. The next new cast member appeared on Christmas Day after some confusion. Garfield gave Frazier a note saying he would be having Christmas Goose for the holidays. Thomas was aghast at the thought of roast goose being served. Garfield&#x27;s hastily typed reply said that Christmas Goose, his nephew, was staying with his uncle for the holidays.
WBKB-TV was sold in February 1953 and became WBBM-TV, the CBS owned-and-operated station, which moved to Channel 2. The initial sale contract for WBKB to CBS called for a one-year period where the new ownership agreed to keep all present programs on the station. Before the transition period was over, &quot;Garfield Goose and Friend&quot; moved to the new WBKB-TV, an ABC owned-and-operated station which jumped to channel 7. During this period, the show was briefly carried nationally on the ABC network. At the time, Chicago did not have a Thanksgiving Day parade to usher in the beginning of the Christmas holiday season. The State Street Council produced a television show instead, featuring popular local children&#x27;s shows. Shown on both WBKB and WGN-TV in 1954, Garfield Goose was part of the broadcast. On the show&#x27;s last day on WBKB in 1955, Garfield said he would drive the castle away, while Thomas tried telling him it was impossible. The castle then rolled out of camera range, thanks to casters installed by the stage crew. The show began airing on its permanent television home, WGN-TV, the next day.

===WGN===
Roy Brown created, built, and/or performed numerous puppet characters for other WGN-TV children&#x27;s shows; one of the first of Brown&#x27;s new characters to be introduced to &quot;Garfield Goose&quot; was Romberg Rabbit, after the show moved to WGN-TV. Romberg had been featured on another children&#x27;s show, &quot;Quiet Riot&quot; (hosted by Buddy Black) and after that show left the air, Romberg joined &quot;Garfield Goose&quot;, where he was introduced as an &quot;unemployed magician&#x27;s assistant.&quot; With the addition of Romberg Rabbit, Thomas began calling the program &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot; (pluralizing the title) and Romberg began &quot;translating&quot; for Garfield.

Other characters were also introduced. They included: bloodhound Beauregard Burnside III, who was the chief of Garfield&#x27;s secret service and who readily fell asleep, prompting Thomas to pick up one of Beau&#x27;s ears and call out &quot;hot dogs, hamburgers, spaghetti and meatballs!&quot; to rouse him; Macintosh Mouse, who was in charge of the castle&#x27;s mailroom. Some of Garfield&#x27;s relatives visited regularly, including nephew Christmas &quot;Chris&quot; Goose and seasonal visitor &quot;Mama&quot; Goose (actually the Garfield Goose puppet with a wig and granny glasses). Since only Thomas could understand what Romberg and the other characters communicated, Thomas would repeat what the puppets &quot;said&quot; for viewers to understand. Garfield would also go down into his castle and type a note (viewers would hear the sound of a typewriter), bringing it up for Thomas to read aloud.

The program was both entertaining and subtly educational. Guests from the Museum of Science and Industry, Lincoln Park Zoo, and the show&#x27;s own viewers with their hobby projects made learning interesting and also fun. In 1968, the understated educational aspect of the program saved a four-year-old boy&#x27;s life. He and his older brother had fallen through ice at a creek near their home. The boys&#x27; mother responded to her older son&#x27;s cries for help; after rescuing them, her younger son was not breathing. The mother knew how to respond to this emergency because of a &quot;Garfield Goose&quot; segment about scouting where a short film about life saving was shown. Remembering what she had seen in the film when she watched the program with her sons, she was able to revive her four-year-old. The show also had a quiet moral tone, as Thomas would explain to Garfield why something he had done or wanted to do was wrong.

Thomas&#x27; performances with a Jew&#x27;s harp either drove the King of the United States to find a place in his castle out of earshot or to simply hit his Prime Minister and Admiral of his navy on the head. When Thomas sang &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; in Latin on the program during the holidays, he explained the meaning of the words to his young audience, and offered to send copies of the words to anyone who wrote to him. He was inundated with requests; it took weeks to deal with sending all the replies. In addition to hosting the weekday show, Thomas wrote all the scripts and produced the program. The local chapter of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences did not begin awarding Emmys until 1958; the first recipient of the Best Male Children&#x27;s Performer was Thomas; he won another award in 1964.

The show remained on WGN-TV (channel 9), which bought the rights in 1955, for over two decades, most of this time running in the late afternoon after children had come home from school. In 1957, Pat Weaver, who created the &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; shows for NBC, had hopes of starting a fourth network. WGN-TV also hoped to be able to syndicate some of its more popular programs through it; one of them was &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot;. During the early 1970s, the program slowly lost viewership to competition and was moved to weekday mornings. The show&#x27;s long run ended on September 10, 1976.

===&quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;===

Frazier Thomas had taken the role of &quot;circus manager&quot; on WGN-TV&#x27;s longtime hit program &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot; after the retirement of Ringmaster Ned Locke in 1976. Thomas kept his puppets on the air with a storyline in which Garfield &quot;bought&quot; &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;. The puppets made daily appearances until 1981. Thomas worked on &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;, later retitled &quot;The Bozo Show&quot;, until his death in 1985. In 1987, the puppets were donated to The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago. The display initially included Garfield Goose, Romberg Rabbit, Macintosh Mouse, Beauregard Burnside III, Christmas Goose, and Ali Gator (the latter a character who appeared only briefly in a serialized adventure during the show&#x27;s early years). Ali Gator was later removed from the museum&#x27;s display.

==Aftermath==
After quitting the show early on and against Frazier Thomas and Roy Brown&#x27;s wishes, Bruce and Claire Newton mounted a live, traveling &quot;Garfield Goose Telepuppets&quot; show at neighborhood events for many years after the series had gone off the air, alongside other non-Garfield Goose puppets built and performed by the pair for other shows. To Thomas and Brown&#x27;s chagrin, WGN-TV management chose not to pursue the matter. Although Bruce Newton would later claim his traveling show featured the first Garfield Goose puppet used on WBKB-TV, a 1991 news story described this puppet as a prototype. After Thomas&#x27; death, Newton attempted to claim that Garfield Goose was entirely his idea. The general manager of WBKB-TV at the time the program first went on the air, Sterling &quot;Red&quot; Quinlan, says it was Frazier Thomas who came up with the concept of Garfield Goose.

As often happened during the 1950s and early 1960s (such as with &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; or the first Super Bowl game), &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot; aired live for much of its history. WGN did not keep many tapes of its local productions, including &quot;Garfield Goose And Friends&quot;. Rather, since the reels of videotape were very costly, they were thriftily recycled. Station management did not foresee how valuable recordings of these broadcasts would have become. Only four complete episodes were preserved: March 14–15, 1974, and September 9–10, 1976 (the latter two being the final two shows aired in the series).

In December 2005, WGN-TV ran a primetime special called &quot;Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics&quot;, which carried the earliest known saved clip of the show, wherein Garfield Goose had &quot;luckily&quot; gotten hold of tickets to the 1959 World Series at Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park. As it happened at the time of this 2005 broadcast, the White Sox had won the 2005 World Series, which moreover was their first World Series appearance since 1959. Additional color kinescope footage from 1965 came from a vintage WGN-TV sales film which also includes some scenes from &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;. The broadcast garnered #1 ratings in the Chicago market and is rerun annually during the holiday season.

In 2005, the Museum of Broadcast Communications awarded WGN-TV&#x27;s Studio 1 a plaque to commemorate the forty years of children&#x27;s television broadcast from the studio. &quot;Garfield Goose and Friends&quot; with a likeness of Frazier Thomas and Garfield, is on the plaque along with Ray Rayner for &quot;Ray Rayner and Friends&quot; and Bob Bell with &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;.

<text>Wing Commander Hugh Gordon Malcolm, VC (2 May 1917 – 4 December 1942) was a Scottish airman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Malcolm was born in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, and educated at Craigflower Preparatory School near Dunfermline and Glenalmond College in Perthshire. He entered the Royal Air Force College Cranwell on 9 January 1936. In January 1938, Malcolm joined No. 26 (Army Co-operation) Squadron at Catterick. In May 1939, he suffered a serious head injury in a Westland Lysander crash.

==Second World War==
When the war started, Malcolm was serving with No. 17 Training Group. On 4 March 1941, he was promoted to flight lieutenant and was Air Liaison Officer on Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s general staff.

By the end of 1941 Malcolm had risen to the rank of squadron leader and joined No. 18 Squadron as a flight commander, flying the Bristol Blenheim and based in Suffolk.

During late 1942 in North Africa, Wing Commander Malcolm assumed command of No. 18 Squadron, flying the Bristol Blenheim Mk. V light bomber. Throughout his service in that sector, his skill and daring were of the highest order. He led two attacks on Bizerta airfield in Tunisia, pressing his attacks to effective conclusion.

On 17 November 1942, the squadron were detailed to carry out an attack on Bizerta, taking advantage of low cloud cover. Twenty miles from the target, the sky cleared, but despite the danger of continuing without a fighter escort, Malcolm decided to go ahead. Despite fierce opposition, the mission was a success with all bombs dropped within the airfield perimeter, and a Junkers Ju 52 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 were shot down, with other enemy aircraft damaged on the ground by machine-gun fire.

Malcolm was a 25-year-old wing commander when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 4 December, he led a thirteen-strong attack on an enemy fighter airfield near Chougui, Tunisia. On reaching the target, however, and starting the attack, the squadron was intercepted by an overwhelming force of enemy fighters from I and II. Gruppen JG 53, and 11 Staffel, JG 2. One by one, all his bombers were shot down, until he himself was shot down in flames.

Malcolm&#x27;s aircraft crashed in flames some 15 miles west of the target. An infantry officer and two other men who arrived at the scene of the crash minutes later retrieved the body of navigator Pilot Officer James Robb. Malcolm, with Robb and gunner Pilot Officer James Grant, were buried in the Beja War Cemetery in a collective grave. Malcolm was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross on 27 April 1943. His was the first Royal Air Force Victoria Cross to be won in North Africa.

==Legacy==
The RAF&#x27;s Malcolm Clubs were named in his honour. These were welfare clubs for RAF personnel, which operated in several countries between 1943 and the early 1970s, although the club at RAF Wittering continued until the 1990s. They are mentioned in Queen&#x27;s Regulations.

Malcolm&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display in the Lord Ashcroft collection at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Thomas Gray, VC (17 May 1914 – 12 May 1940) was a British airman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==RAF career==
Gray was 25 years old, and a sergeant in 12 Squadron, Royal Air Force during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he and his pilot Flying Officer Donald Garland were awarded the VC in a joint citation.

On 12 May 1940, over the Albert Canal, Belgium, one bridge in particular, at Veldwezelt, was being used by the invading German army, with protection from fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft and machine-guns. The RAF was ordered to demolish this vital bridge, and five Fairey Battle bombers were despatched with Sergeant Gray as the navigator in the plane leading the bombing attack. They met an inferno of anti-aircraft fire, but the mission was accomplished, much of the success being due to the coolness and resourcefulness of pilot Donald Garland of the leading aircraft and the navigation of Sergeant Gray. Only one aircraft made it back to base.

Gray is buried at the Heverlee War Cemetery near Leuven in Belgium.

==Victoria Cross citation==
The announcement and accompanying citation for Gray&#x27;s VC was published in supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 11 June 1940, reading:

==Legacy==
A Vickers VC-10 Serial &#x27;XR807&#x27; of No. 101 Squadron was named &#x27;Donald Garland VC &amp; Thomas Gray VC&#x27;.

In 2005, to mark its 90th anniversary, No.12 Squadron RAF flew a Tornado GR4 with Flying Officer Garland&#x27;s and Sergeant Gray&#x27;s names painted under the cockpit as a mark of respect.

There is a monument on the bridge to the operation.

On the day of the attack on the bridge, Garland and his crew flew from the grass airfield near the village of Amifontaine, France, where No. 12 Squadron had been based since December 1939. No memorial to the airfield, and to the men who flew from it, has been reported to exist in the area.

<text>James Allen Ward, VC (14 June 1919 – 15 September 1941) was a New Zealand aviator and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that could be awarded at the time to personnel of the British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Wanganui, Ward was a teacher when the Second World War began. He immediately volunteered for the Royal New Zealand Air Force and after completing flight training in New Zealand, travelled to England. In mid-1941, he was posted to No. 75 Squadron, which operated Vickers Wellington bombers. He participated in his first few bombing missions as a co-pilot, during the last of which, on 7 July 1941, he earned the VC for his feat in climbing out onto the wing of his Wellington bomber to extinguish an engine fire caused by a night fighter attack. Ward was the first of three New Zealand airmen to be awarded the VC during the Second World War. He was killed two months later commanding his own Wellington on a bombing mission to Germany.

==Early life==
James Allen Ward was born on 14 June 1919 in Wanganui, New Zealand, to English immigrants, Percy and Ada Ward. He was educated at Wanganui Technical College and after graduation, trained as a teacher in Wellington. Having qualified in 1939, he had just accepted a teaching position at Castlecliff School in Wanganui when the Second World War broke out. Ward immediately volunteered for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF).

==Second World War==
===Training===
Despite being quick to enlist in the RNZAF, Ward was not called up until 1 July 1940, when he reported to Levin for initial training. He then proceeded to No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School at RNZAF Taieri, followed by more advanced courses at Wigram Air Base in Christchurch. He was rated as a pilot of high average ability and of confident and reliable character. During his period of flight training, one of his classmates was Fraser Barron, who went on to become a notable bomber pilot during the war.

Ward qualified as a pilot on 18 January 1941 and was promoted to sergeant shortly thereafter. At the end of the month he departed for England aboard the troopship &quot;Aorangi&quot;, to commence service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). On arrival, he was selected for training on heavy bombers and posted to 20 Bomber Operational Training Unit RAF, in Scotland. Upon completion of his courses at RAF Lossiemouth in mid-1941, Ward was posted to No. 75 Squadron. According to Hugh Kimpton, a fellow New Zealander at Lossiemouth, only one place was available at the squadron at the time. Ward was selected as a result of winning a coin toss between Kimpton and him.

===Service with No. 75 Squadron===
No. 75 Squadron was an RAF unit formed around a core of RNZAF flying personnel present in England prior to the outbreak of the Second World War to take delivery of 30 Vickers Wellington bombers purchased by the New Zealand government. These personnel had set up a unit at RAF Marham, in Norfolk, to prepare for the transportation of the Wellingtons back to New Zealand. However, once hostilities commenced, with the permission of the New Zealand government, the fliers were transferred to the Royal Air Force. Shortly afterwards, it was arranged for the RNZAF personnel to form the cadre of 75 Squadron, the first Commonwealth squadron of Bomber Command. At the time of Ward&#x27;s arrival at 75 Squadron, it was based at the Royal Air Force&#x27;s base at Feltwell in Norfolk, and operating Wellington bombers. His first operational flight was made on 14 June, as a second pilot to Squadron Leader Reuben Widdowson, a Canadian, on a bombing mission to Düsseldorf in Germany. Over the next few weeks, he flew six more bombing missions accompanying Widdowson.
Widdowson and Ward flew their sixth and last mission together on 7 July during a raid on Münster. While returning home over the Zuider Zee on the Dutch coast, Ward&#x27;s Wellington was attacked by a German Bf 110 night fighter. A fuel tank in the starboard wing was ruptured, causing a fire around the rear of the starboard engine. After initial attempts to put out the flames using fire extinguishers directed through a hole made in the fuselage failed, Widdowson ordered the crew to bail out. However, Ward proposed that he climb out and try and smother the fire using an engine cover. He crawled out through the astrodome on the top of the fuselage, secured by a rope. Making his way down the side and along the wing of the aircraft, he kicked or tore holes in the fuselage&#x27;s covering fabric with a fire axe to give himself hand-and foot-holes.

Ward soon reached the engine and attempted to smother the flames with a canvas cover. With the fire out, he stuffed the cover into the hole from which fuel from a damaged petrol line had leaked and exacerbated the fire. Ward, now exhausted, made his way back to the astrodome with the navigator, Sergeant Joe Lawton of the RNZAF, keeping tension on the rope tethered to Ward and assisting him back into the aircraft. Although the cover shortly blew away by the slipstream, the fire had burnt itself out and the plane was now safe. Instead of the crew having to bail out, the aircraft made an emergency landing, without flaps or brakes, at Newmarket. The Wellington ran into a hedge and fence at the end of the runway and was written off.

Ward described his experience out on the wing of the aircraft, exposed to the slipstream, as &quot;...being in a terrific gale only worse than any gale I&#x27;ve ever known&quot;. To recognise Ward&#x27;s courage, the commander of 75 Squadron, Wing Commander Cyrus Kay, recommended him for the Victoria Cross (VC). Instituted in 1856, the VC was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on military personnel of the British Empire. Kay also recommended Widdowson for the Distinguished Flying Cross and Sergeant Allan Box for the Distinguished Flying Medal. Box, a New Zealander, was the tail gunner of Ward&#x27;s aircraft and had shot down the night fighter. The awards for Widdowson and Box were immediately approved while Ward&#x27;s VC was announced on 5 August.

The citation for Ward&#x27;s VC was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and read:
Ward&#x27;s VC was the first of three made to New Zealand airmen during the war; the others awarded were to Squadron Leader Leonard Trent, a bomber pilot, and Flying Officer Lloyd Trigg, a pilot with Coastal Command. According to Clifton Fadiman, a compiler of anecdotes, Ward was summoned to 10 Downing Street soon after the announcement of his VC, by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The New Zealander was apparently awestruck by the experience and was unable to answer the Prime Minister&#x27;s questions. Churchill regarded Ward with some compassion. &quot;You must feel very humble and awkward in my presence,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; managed Ward. &quot;Then you can imagine how humble and awkward I feel in yours,&quot; said Churchill.

Ward had a period of leave after receiving his VC. Hector Bolitho, a New Zealander in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, spent time with him and later recounted an incident when at a dinner, Ward fainted after a fuel from a cigarette lighter was accidentally spilled onto his hand and set alight. Supposedly the event had triggered memories of the flaming wing of his Wellington bomber. A doctor treated the minor burn and gave Ward a note to give to the medical officer at No. 75 Squadron. Bolitho alleged the note stated Ward was not fit to fly but it was never passed on. 

On returning to his squadron, Ward was given command of his own crew and aircraft. He flew his first mission as commander to Brest without incident. On his second mission, a raid on Hamburg carried out on 15 September, his Wellington encountered a night fighter shortly after releasing its bombs. Set on fire by the attacking night fighter, Ward ordered his crew to bail out and held his aircraft steady enough for two of his crew to do so; they subsequently became prisoners of war. When the Wellington crashed near Hamburg, the remaining crew and Ward were still on board. It was initially reported that the Wellington had been hit and destroyed by flak. It was not until the two surviving crew members were released from their prisoner of war camp was it determined that a night fighter was involved in the destruction of Ward&#x27;s aircraft.

Unbeknown to Ward, an official at the Air Ministry had suggested to the New Zealand government that he be returned to New Zealand. It was appreciated that Ward&#x27;s profile as a result of the VC award would be useful for propaganda and recruitment purposes. He could also have served as an instructor with one of the home-based RNZAF squadrons. On 15 September 1941, the day of Ward&#x27;s death, Group Captain Hugh Saunders, the Chief of Air Staff of the RNZAF, approved the proposal to return him to New Zealand.

Ward&#x27;s body was recovered from the wreckage of his aircraft and buried by the Germans in a civilian cemetery. Initially reported in the United Kingdom and New Zealand as missing, presumed dead, at one stage Ward was believed to be a prisoner of war in Germany. Confirmation of his death was officially reported in August 1942 by the International Red Cross. After the war and following official identification, his remains were reinterred in the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery Ohlsdorf in Hamburg.
==Victoria Cross and legacy==
Ward&#x27;s VC was presented to his parents by the Governor General of New Zealand at Government House in Wellington on 16 October 1942. The Ward family loaned Ward&#x27;s VC and other service medals to the RNZAF for several years until 2006, when they were returned. The medals were subsequently lent to the Auckland War Memorial Museum for display.

There are a number of memorials to Ward, one being a painting by Peter McIntyre, entitled &quot;Memorial to Sergeant James Allen Ward, V.C.&quot; and depicting Ward&#x27;s feat, hangs at the Sarjeant Gallery in Ward&#x27;s hometown of Wanganui. There is also a plaque honouring him in Queen&#x27;s Gardens in Dunedin. In November 2004, the Wellington College of Education, in preparation for merging with Victoria University, renamed one of its halls in honour of Ward. On 14 May 2011, the community centre at Feltwell, where Ward had flown from while serving with No. 75 Squadron, was dedicated in his honour. It had served as a sergeant&#x27;s mess hall during the Second World War.

<text>William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse VC (born William Barnard Moorhouse; 26 September 1887 – 27 April 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Rhodes-Moorhouse was the first airman to be awarded the VC.

==Early life==
William Barnard Moorhouse was born at Rokeby, Yorkshire, England. His mother Mary Ann Rhodes (born c 1850) was the daughter of William Barnard Rhodes and Otahi, a member of the Taranaki (Tuturu), Ngati Tama, Ngati Ruanui and Te Āti Awa Māori nations in the Wellington area of New Zealand. When Rhodes married Sarah King, the very young child Mary Anne was &quot;given&quot; (&quot;Whaangai&quot;) to the newlyweds. After his first wife died, Rhodes married Sarah Ann Moorhouse, the sister of William Sefton Moorhouse, a prominent Canterbury politician and settler. She adopted Mary Ann Rhodes.

Mary Anne&#x27;s father had been a whaling captain who became a prominent Wellington settler, businessman and politician. On his death Mary Anne Rhodes received a legacy that made her the richest woman in New Zealand.

She married her second adoptive mother&#x27;s younger brother, Edward Moorhouse, in Wellington in 1883. They moved to England and raised four children, including William, who went to Harrow School and (briefly) Trinity Hall, Cambridge, which he left in 1909.

William took private flying lessons and gained his pilot&#x27;s certificate in that year. Besides designing aircraft he competed in aviation races and was the first to cross the English Channel, from Douai to Ashford, Kent, with two passengers, his wife and a London &quot;Evening News&quot; journalist, in a biplane.

On a visit to New Zealand in 1907 while practising for a motorcycle race on New Brighton Beach, Christchurch, he killed Kennett Frederick Gourlay, a seven-year-old child who had run out in front of him. He was charged with manslaughter but acquitted by the Supreme Court in Christchurch in August that year. In 1912 he was again charged with manslaughter following the death of Arthur William Cheacker on a county road in Gloucestershire while driving his racing car.

He changed his surname to Rhodes-Moorhouse in 1912, shortly before he married, as required by the will of his grandfather. His wife, Linda Beatrice Morrit, was also a flying enthusiast. She died in 1973 aged 86.

==World War I service==

At the outbreak of war Rhodes-Moorhouse enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps and as a second lieutenant was posted to Farnborough. Seeking to serve on an operational basis, he obtained a posting to No. 2 Squadron on 20 March 1915 at Merville, flying the B.E.2.

On 26 April 1915 at Kortrijk, Belgium, Rhodes-Moorhouse swept low over the railway junction that he had been ordered to attack. He released his 100 lb (45 kg) bomb and was immediately plunged into a heavy barrage of small arms fire from rifles and a machine-gun in the belfry of Kortrijk Church; he was severely wounded by a bullet in his thigh, and his plane was badly hit. Returning to the Allied lines, he again ran into heavy fire from the ground and was wounded twice more. He managed to get his aircraft back, and insisted on making his report before being taken to the Casualty Clearing Station. He died the next day, 27 April 1915. For this action he was awarded the VC. The citation for his award read as follows:

&quot;For most conspicuous bravery on 26th April, 1915, in flying to Courtrai and dropping bombs on the railway line near that station. On starting the return journey he was mortally wounded, but succeeded in flying for 35 miles to his destination, at a very low altitude, and reported the successful accomplishment of his object. He has since died of his wounds.&quot;

His body was returned to England and buried at the family home Parnham House, Beaminster, Dorset, and later the ashes of his son were placed alongside him.

==William Henry Rhodes-Moorhouse==
His son, also called William (Willie), was less than a year old when his father died. He went on to join No. 601 Squadron RAF. He was shot down and killed over Kent during the Battle of Britain in 1940, shortly after being awarded the DFC.

<doc id="1179267" wikidata="Q7145251" url="?curid=1179267" title="Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, patriarch (also called evangelist) is an office of the priesthood. It is considered to be either an office of the patriarchal priesthood or the Melchizedek priesthood.

==Latter Day Saint movement==
In the early days of the Church of Christ and the Latter Day Saint movement, a single patriarch, known as the Presiding Patriarch or Patriarch to the Church, exercised his office throughout the whole church. The first patriarch was Joseph Smith Sr.; after his death, his oldest living son Hyrum became the patriarch. Some Latter Day Saint denominations continue the practice of a single Presiding Patriarch, who in some cases holds the highest office of the church organization; others have multiple patriarchs who hold more general positions in the organization.

==Patriarch in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

While the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) originally continued to have a single church-wide position of &quot;Presiding Patriarch&quot;, this practice was discontinued on October 4, 1979. Within the LDS Church today, patriarch is an office in the Melchizedek priesthood.

A patriarch is ordained and called to serve the members of a particular stake organization. He is recommended by the stake presidency, with each recommendation approved by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The selected man must be married, hold the Melchizedek priesthood, have received a patriarchal blessing, and normally be at least 55 years old. He must be ordained to the office of patriarch by the laying on of hands by an apostle or by the stake president (when authorized by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles). Patriarchs are also set apart to serve in a particular stake. A patriarch retains the priesthood office of patriarch for life. Prior to ordination, the proposed ordination of a patriarch must be approved by the common consent of the priesthood holders (or alternatively, the entire membership) in the stake.

A patriarch&#x27;s primary responsibility is to give patriarchal blessings to members in his stake. He also has the authority to give such blessings to all of his descendants, regardless of what stake they live in. Unlike other priesthood blessings, patriarchal blessings are recorded and archived at LDS Church headquarters. Under ordinary circumstances, a member will receive only one such blessing in his or her lifetime.

Up until the beginning of the 20th century, patriarchs were compensated for their time either by charging for blessing or, later, receiving a stipend from the church headquarters. The practice of charging for blessings was put to an end when it came to the attention of the church leadership that patriarchs were traveling door to door and &quot;underbidding each other in the price of blessings.&quot;

There was a tradition among church members that a blessing for health was more potent if it was received from an ordained patriarch. In the 1940s, the church issued an instruction that such blessings were not to be seen as being any different than those received from any other priesthood holder.

Local stake patriarchs may be designated as &quot;non-functioning&quot; if he is incapacitated by age or illness, leaves to serve as a full-time missionary, moves from the stake, is absent from his home for other reasons, or is approved to be called to another position of church administration. (Church leaders must make advance requests to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve in order to call a functioning patriarch as a bishop, stake president, or high councilor, but such requests are &quot;rarely approved&quot;.) In such circumstances, the patriarch is relieved from his responsibilities of giving patriarchal blessings, but he is not formally released and will be able to function as a patriarch again if approved to do so. If a patriarch who has previously been designated as non-functioning is made functional again, he does not have to be re-ordained since he has retained the priesthood office.

===Patriarch emeritus===
The priesthood calling patriarch emeritus was created in October 1979, when the Patriarch to the Church, Eldred G. Smith, was released from active duties and designated as an emeritus general authority. Smith was the only Presiding Patriarch in LDS Church history to have been designated patriarch emeritus.

===Fathers as patriarchs===
The LDS Church teaches that a father should be a (non-ordained) patriarch in his household, meaning that it is his duty to preside within his own family in providing for the basic physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of all family members. This does not always hold true when the father is not a member of the church. Accordingly, it is proper for priesthood representatives who are visiting a home to defer to him. If he is worthy and holds the proper priesthood authority, it is likewise customary for the church to invite or allow him to officiate in priesthood ordinances for his own family, including giving his children &quot;father&#x27;s blessings&quot;, which are similar to patriarchal blessings. Such blessings may be recorded like patriarchal blessings, but are not forwarded to the LDS Church archives.

==Patriarch in the Community of Christ==
In the Community of Christ, which was formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, an evangelist is an office in the Melchizedec Order of the priesthood. Previous to the 1980s, Evangelists were known both as Patriarchs and Evangelists. The name &quot;Patriarch&quot; was dropped when women were first ordained to this office.

The Community of Christ originally retained the single church wide position of &quot;Presiding Patriarch or &quot;Presiding Evangelist&quot;. In 1835 the Community of Christ allowed for the calling of &quot;Patriarch-Evangelist&quot; within large branches of the church. However, it wasn&#x27;t until after the 1894 General Conference that was generally practiced.

Calls to the office of evangelist originate from members the Council of Twelve Apostles following consultation with the Presiding Evangelist. They are approved by the Council of Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency, and vote is taken by either the World Conference or by a Mission Center conference to sustain and approve that call. All evangelists belong to the Order of Evangelists, which is directed by the Presiding Evangelist.

<text>Group Captain Lionel Wilmot Brabazon Rees, (31 July 1884 – 28 September 1955) was a Welsh aviator, flying ace, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was credited with eight confirmed aerial victories, comprising one enemy aircraft captured, one destroyed, one &quot;forced to land&quot; and five &quot;driven down&quot;. Rees and his gunner, Flight Sergeant James McKinley Hargreaves, were the only two airmen to become aces flying the earliest purpose-built British fighter aeroplane, the Vickers Gunbus.

Rees also had a keen interest in archaeology. While flying from Cairo to Baghdad in the 1920s, he took some of the earliest archaeological aerial photographs of sites in eastern Transjordan (now Jordan), and published several articles in &quot;Antiquity&quot; and the journal of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He is considered a father of the archaeological studies of this remote area, and a pioneer of aerial archaeology. He was also an accomplished sailor.

==Early life and education==
Rees was born at 5 Castle Street, Caernarfon, on 31 July 1884, the son of Charles Herbert Rees, a solicitor and honorary colonel in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and his wife Leonara. Rees attended Eastbourne College before entering the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1902. 

Rees was commissioned on 23 December 1903 into the Royal Garrison Artillery and was posted to Gibraltar. Promoted to lieutenant in 1906, he moved to Sierra Leone in 1908 and in May 1913 was seconded to the Southern Nigeria Regiment.

== First World War ==
Rees was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Garrison Artillery, a branch of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. In 1912, Rees learned to fly at his own expense, receiving his Aviator&#x27;s Certificate (no. 392) in January 1913. By 1913–14, Rees was attached to the West African Frontier Force when he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in August 1914, initially as an instructor at Upavon, he was promoted to captain in October 1914. In early 1915 he took command of the newly formed No. 11 Squadron at Netheravon and in July they moved to France. He first saw action flying the Vickers Gunbus with No. 11 Squadron in mid-1915, earning a reputation as an aggressive pilot and an above average marksman.

===Military Cross===
Rees was awarded the Military Cross for his actions in 1915, gazetted as follows:

By this time he had claimed one aircraft captured, one destroyed, one &quot;forced to land&quot; and five &quot;driven down&quot;.

Rees returned to England at the end of 1915, where he took command of the Central Flying School Flight at Upavon. In June 1916 he took No. 32 Squadron to France.

===Victoria Cross===
Rees was 31 years old and on detached service from the Royal Garrison Artillery to the Royal Flying Corps on Flying Duties as a temporary major in No. 32 Squadron when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

In the first hours of the Somme Offensive, Rees was on patrol, taking off in Airco DH.2 No. 6015 at 0555 hours. His attempt to join a formation of &quot;British&quot; machines brought an attack from one of the Germans. He shot up the attacker, hitting its fuselage between the two aircrew. As it dived away, Rees attacked a Roland. Long range fire from three other Germans did not discourage Rees from closing on it; it emitted a hazy cloud of smoke from its engine from the 30 rounds Rees fired into it and it fled. Rees then single-handedly went after five more Germans. A bullet in the thigh paralysed his leg, forcing him to temporarily break off his assault. As the shock of the wound wore off, he was able to pursue the German formation leader, which was leaving after dropping its bomb. He fired his Lewis machine gun empty. In frustration, he drew his pistol but dropped it into his DH.2&#x27;s nacelle. Meanwhile, the German two-seater pulled away above him. The German formation was shattered and scattered.

Rees gave up the futile chase, and returned to base. Once landed, he calmly asked for steps so he could deplane. Once seated on the aerodrome grass, he had a tender fetched to take him to hospital. The valour of his actions earned him the Victoria Cross. Its citation reads:

He convalesced for a while due to his injuries from the 1 July action, and went on a War Office mission to the United States, becoming a temporary lieutenant colonel in May 1917. For the remainder of hostilities Rees commanded a School of Aerial Fighting based at RAF Turnberry.

==Post-war career==
On 2 November 1918 Rees was awarded the Air Force Cross in recognition of valuable flying services. In 1919, Rees was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. On 1 August 1919 he resigned his commission with the Royal Garrison Artillery and took a permanent commission in the newly formed Royal Air Force as a lieutenant-colonel. In 1920, Rees was presented with a sword and the freedom of Caernarfon.
In June 1920, he took command of the flying wing at RAF College Cranwell, becoming the assistant commandant in March 1923. Promoted to group captain after the RAF moved away from the Army rank structure, Rees became deputy director in the Air Ministry directorate of training and in January 1925 he became an additional air aide-de-camp to the King.

Rees was posted to RAF Amman in May 1926 and given command of the RAF Transjordan and Palestine in October 1926. He had a keen interest in archaeology, and while flying on the Cairo to Baghdad route during this period, he took some of the earliest archaeological aerial photographs of sites in eastern Transjordan (now Jordan), and published several articles in &quot;Antiquity&quot; and the journal of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He is considered a father of the archaeological studies of this remote area, and a pioneer of aerial archaeology.

Rees returned to England in October 1926 to take command of the RAF Depot at Uxbridge before he retired from the RAF in 1931 with the rank of group captain. In 1933, he sailed single-handedly across the Atlantic from Wales to Nassau in the Bahamas in a ketch. For this achievement he was awarded the prestigious Blue Water Medal by the Cruising Club of America in 1934.

When the Second World War broke out, Rees returned to the United Kingdom from the Bahamas and once again joined the RAF. He relinquished his rank of group captain in January 1941 at his own request and was granted the rank of wing commander. He served in Africa. On 21 November 1942 Rees reverted to the rank of group captain on the retired list.

Rees returned home to the Bahamas and on 12 August 1947, aged 62, he married Sylvia Williams, a young local woman. They had three children. 

== Death and legacy ==
Rees died at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau on 28 September 1955 from leukaemia. He was buried at Nassau war cemetery. Described as a real gentleman, during his time in Transjordan and possibly during other parts of his career, Rees was known to give his pay to service charities.

An RAF BAe 146 jet of No. 32 Squadron was named in his honour on 21 June 2019.

<text>The Naval Service () is the maritime component of the Defence Forces of Ireland and is one of the three branches of the Irish Defence Forces. Its base is in Haulbowline, County Cork.

Though preceded by earlier maritime defence organisations, the Naval Service was formed in 1946. Since the 1970s a major role of the Naval Service has been the provision of fisheries protection in Ireland&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Other roles include sea patrol, surveillance, and smuggling prevention. Occasionally the service undertakes longer missions in support of other elements of the Defence Forces, Irish peacekeepers serving with the United Nations, or humanitarian and trade missions.

The Naval Service has an active establishment of 1,094, and a reserve establishment of 200. Like other components of the Defence Forces, the Naval Service has struggled to maintain strength and as of April 2023 has only 764 active personnel, and 77 reserve personnel.

Since July 2017 the Naval Service has participated in the European External Action Service mission which focuses a number of EU navies on humanitarian and training roles in the Mediterranean. This mission entitled &quot;EU Navfor Med&quot; is the first time Ireland has taken part in a multi-role and multi-national naval operation.

Ships in the Irish Naval Service are designated with the ship prefix of &quot;Long Éireannach&quot; (Irish Ship), which is abbreviated to LÉ.

== History ==


=== Coastal and Marine Service ===

The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 stipulated that the Irish Free State, which in the event came into being in December 1922, was to be given the responsibility to police its customs and fishing, while Britain and its Royal Navy would remain in control of Irish waters.

In 1923, the Coastal and Marine Service (CMS) was created, and one year later it was disbanded.

During the Irish Civil War, in August 1922, a ship belonging to the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company, &quot;Lady Wicklow&quot;, led by Captain Patrick Ryan, was used to bring Irish National Army troops around the coast to Fenit, the port of Tralee, in County Kerry. This naval involvement technically preceded the foundation of the Irish state, as at the time Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Built in 1890 in Dublin Dockyard, the ship measured . In all, 450 troops, including officers, were landed. Tralee was later captured from local republican forces.

, formerly the British armed steam yacht &quot;Helga&quot;, which had been used by the Royal Navy to shell Dublin during the 1916 rising, was the only CMS ship during this period. The CMS ship &quot;Muirchu&quot; continued to patrol Irish fisheries. &quot;Muirchu&quot; was re-armed in 1936 and purchased by the Irish government on advice of members of the later named Maritime Institute of Ireland for fisheries protection.

In 1938, the United Kingdom handed over the three treaty ports (Cork Harbour, Bere Haven and Lough Swilly). Consequently, the Royal Navy withdrew from Cork Harbour in July 1938. &quot;Fort Rannoch&quot; was added to the Irish fleet at that time.

=== Marine and Coastwatching Service ===
In 1939 the Irish Government ordered two motor torpedo boats (MTBs) from Vosper Thorneycroft. When World War II began in September 1939 the Marine and Coastwatching Service was set up. In order for Ireland to remain neutral, it became clear that a full naval service would be required. The government consequentially ordered an additional four MTBs. By the end of 1940 the Irish Marine and Coastwatching Service consisted of six MTBs and four other assorted craft.

During the war the service protected fisheries, regulated merchant ships, and laid mines off Cork and Waterford.

In June 1940, an Irish Marine and Coastwatching Service MTB returned to Haulbowline after making two trips to rescue British and French soldiers during the Dunkirk evacuation.

By 1941 the Marine and Coastwatching Service consisted of 10 craft (6 MTBs plus 4 assorted vessels) and about 300 all ranks. In 1942, the service was renamed the &quot;Marine Service&quot;.

=== Naval Service ===

In September 1946, the Marine Service was formally disbanded and the Naval Service established as a permanent component of the Irish Defence Forces. The Naval Service purchased three s from the United Kingdom in 1946 and 1947. The tradition of naming Irish Naval Ships after figures in Celtic mythology began, and the ships were named , and . These three ships were to become a key part of the Naval Service in the 1950s and 1960s. The first formal training of Irish naval cadets took place at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, UK, in 1947. In 1970, &quot;Cliona&quot; and &quot;Macha&quot; were withdrawn from service and scrapped, leaving &quot;Maev&quot; as the sole ship in the Naval Service. &quot;Maev&quot; was withdrawn from service in 1972. In 1971, the Naval Service commissioned three armed s: &quot;Grainne&quot;, &quot;Banba&quot; and &quot;Fola&quot;.

In 1971, the Naval Service commissioned Verolme Cork Dockyard to build an offshore patrol ship. Named , it was the first naval vessel purpose-built in Ireland to patrol its waters. The exclusive economic zone of Ireland was increased in 1976 from to . The subsequent strain put on the Naval Service prompted funding from the European Economic Community to acquire five additional vessels, four of which were eventually built. Meanwhile, the former Irish lights vessel &quot;Isolda&quot; was purchased to act as a training ship, bearing the pennant number A15 and renamed . It served until being sold for scrap in 1984. A Danish stern trawler &quot;Helen Basse&quot; was also leased for a year, serving under the name LÉ &quot;Ferdia&quot;, pennant number A16.

The 50th anniversary of the Naval Service took place in 1996. Celebrations included a fleet review by President Mary Robinson. In 1999, a new ship was delivered to the Naval Service, marking the beginning of a new class of larger patrol vessels followed by , commissioned in September 2001 replacing LÉ &quot;Deirdre&quot;.

While most missions undertaken by the Naval Service are in Irish waters, on occasion longer missions are undertaken in support of Irish peacekeepers serving with the United Nations, representing Ireland, or in support of Irish trade missions. In 2002, LÉ &quot;Niamh&quot; delivered supplies to Irish troops in Eritrea, then continued on a trade promotional tour to India, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Korea, and Japan, becoming the first Irish naval vessel to cross the Equator. In 2006 travelled to Argentina, attending ceremonies connected with the 149th anniversary of the death of Irish-born Admiral William Brown, founder of the Argentine Navy, and also visited ports in Uruguay and Brazil. In 2010, &quot;Niamh&quot; travelled to the Americas, visiting Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the United States.

In 2010, two new ships were planned for the Naval Service. The first, , was delivered in April 2014 replacing LÉ &quot;Emer&quot;, and the second, LÉ &quot;James Joyce&quot;, replaced LÉ &quot;Aoife&quot; in 2015. The option for a third, LÉ &quot;William Butler Yeats&quot;, was exercised in June 2014 and commissioned in October 2016. The new ships displace over 1,900 tons, have a top speed of 23 knots, a range of 6,000 nautical miles. They are armed with an OTO Melara 76 mm/62, and have a longer deck area that can accommodate deep-sea search-and-rescue submarines and unmanned aircraft.

In May 2015, it was announced that the Naval Service would deploy a ship to the Mediterranean to form part of the EU humanitarian response to the European migrant crisis. The fleet flagship, &quot;Eithne&quot;, left Cork on 16 May 2015 for an eight-week deployment to the region, during which time the ship picked up a total of 3,377 people in the waters between Libya and Sicily. In July, the mission was extended with the deployment of first, &quot;Niamh&quot; from July to September, and then &quot;Samuel Beckett&quot; from September until November.

In March 2022, the government announced the purchase of two retired RNZN inshore patrol vessels. In July 2022, in advance of their arrival, the fleet&#x27;s three oldest vessels (&quot;Eithne&quot;, &quot;Orla&quot;, &quot;Ciara&quot;) were decommissioned. Two other vessels (&quot;Róisín&quot;, &quot;Niamh&quot;) were placed in &quot;operational reserve&quot; in January 2023. The growing &quot;manpower crises&quot; in the Naval Service meant that two additional ships (&quot;James Joyce&quot;, &quot;George Bernard Shaw&quot;) were placed into reserve in August 2023. As of July 2024, the Naval Service was reportedly operating a &quot;three-ship operational posture&quot;, with the four P60 class vessels on patrol in operational rotation and two other vessels under refit or in reserve. The two new inshore patrol vessels, L.É. &quot;Aoibhinn&quot; and L.É. &quot;Gobnait&quot;, were commissioned into service in September 2024.

== Organisation ==

=== Naval Headquarters ===

The Naval Service is headed by Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service (FOCNS) Commodore Michael Malone who is based at Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Naval Base Haulbowline. NHQ oversees all aspects of the Naval Service, with a number of commands under it: Naval Operations Command (NOC) and Naval Support Command (NSC). The Naval College, like the DFTC is of an equal footing with the two commands, with all three headed by an officer commanding who report directly to the FOCNS of NHQ. Commodore Malone is the first marine engineer to be appointed as FOCNS, his prior appointment was as Officer Commanding Naval Support Command (OCNSC).

=== Naval Operations Command ===

Naval Operations Command is the principal command component of the Irish Naval Service responsible for all day-to-day activities of the service, both at sea and on shore. One of three major command components of the NS this command is responsible for overseeing the work and mission objectives of all Irish naval vessels at sea who report directly to Naval Operations Command at Naval Base Haulbowline. The command is a direct subordinate to NHQ and is overseen by Officer Commanding Naval Operations Command (OCNOC). The OCNOC reports directly to the head of the Irish Naval Service, the FOCNS.

=== Naval Support Command ===

Naval Support Command oversees the personnel, logistical and technical resources of the NS, allowing the service to meet its operational and training commitments. Ship procurement, maintenance, repair, provisions, ordnance, food, fuel, personnel and transportation are handled by Naval Support Command. Naval Support Command is headed by Officer Commanding Naval Support Command and reports directly to the FOCNS.

=== Naval College ===

The Naval College is the principal naval military college in Ireland providing training to cadets, NCOs and recruits of the Irish Naval Service. The Naval College trains and educates personnel for service, providing a mixture of different courses ranging from officer training right through to naval engineering. The Naval College is based out of the Naval Service&#x27;s headquarters at Naval Base Haulbowline but also provides classes and lessons in non-military naval training at the nearby National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI) in Ringaskiddy.

The Naval College contains a number of schools providing specialist courses including the Officer Training School, the Military and Naval Operational Training School and the School of Naval Engineering. The Officer Commanding Naval College reports directly to the FOCNS.

=== Specialist units ===

The Naval Service has a number of specialist units that handle unique and varied tasks within the service.

==== Diving Section ====

The Naval Service Diving Section (NSDS) (Irish: Rannóg Tumadóireachta na Seirbháse Cabhlaigh), formally part of NOC&#x27;s shore operations section, is a specialist unit of the Irish Naval Service, a branch of the Defence Forces, the military of Ireland. The Naval Service Diving Section specialises in underwater diving tasks for the Naval Service, and since its formation in 1964 has become Ireland&#x27;s most advanced diving team, aiding other state agencies in various specialist roles.

Various mission roles of the NSDS include search and recovery, underwater survey, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) underwater engineering and military diving training. They have conducted combat diving training for Army Ranger Wing members after selecting combat diving as a speciality.

==== Naval Intelligence Cell ====

The Naval Intelligence Cell, part of the NOC&#x27;s Intelligence and Fisheries Section, is responsible for the collection, collation and dissemination of naval intelligence and is the naval component of the Defence Forces&#x27; Directorate of Military Intelligence.

==== Fishery Monitoring Centre ====

The Fishery Monitoring Centre, part of the NOC&#x27;s Intelligence and Fisheries Section, oversees the identification, monitoring and surveillance of fisheries vessels in Irish waters as part of the Vessel Monitoring System. The Fishery Monitoring Centre coordinates with fisheries agencies in other countries.

== Roles and capabilities ==

The Naval Service&#x27;s military roles and the functions it carries out are more those of a coast guard rather than that of a conventional navy. Lacking both anti-submarine and anti-aircraft capabilities, and without standoff weapons such as surface-to-surface missiles, the Naval Service&#x27;s ability to control Ireland&#x27;s territorial waters and provide close naval support is extremely limited. Sea lift is also limited and ad hoc. The Naval Service&#x27;s non-military capabilities in aid to the civil power and other government departments is fishery protection, search and rescue, drugs interdiction and dive support.

=== Irish territorial waters and EEZ ===
Since the 1960s Ireland has seen its jurisdiction over the North Atlantic extend from (pre-1967) to (pre-1990s). This was increased to again in 1994 when the introduction of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) gave approval to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This convention grants the state sovereign rights over the seabed, its subsoil and the water adjacent to the seabed within the 200 nautical mile limit.

Negotiations are taking place that could see the influence of coastal states extended beyond the 200 nautical miles of EEZs. Part VI of UNCLOS concerns a coastal state&#x27;s continental shelf out to from the coastline. In 2007, Ireland became the first country to gain approval for the extension of its continental shelf, to the west of the island, and now has responsibility for an area of some – an increase of 100 per cent.

Among the tasks mandated to the NSDS include the following;
* Search and recovery
* Underwater survey
* Explosive ordnance disposal
* Underwater engineering
* Military diving training

===EU Navfor Med===

In July 2017, the Irish government agreed to allowing the Naval Service to join other EU member state navies in Operation Sophia (the EU operation focused on refugee smuggling in the Mediterranean). Since 2015 the Irish Navy has had bilateral agreement called Operation Pontus with the Italian Navy in regards to Mediterranean search and rescue operations. In order for Ireland to join the mission it required the passing of the so-called &quot;triple lock system&quot;. This requires cabinet, &quot;Dáil&quot; and UN approval.
In its previous stance the Irish Navy was limited in its remit and sourcing of intelligence due to its lack of participation in EU Navfor Med. There was also a lack of force protection in the event of an attack on Irish vessels but this changed with the go-ahead for EU participation.

== Assets ==
As of September 2024, the Naval Service fleet included four offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), two large patrol vessels (LPVs), and two inshore patrol vessels (IPVs).

Until 2014, all vessels had been named with (mainly female) names taken from Celtic mythology and Irish folklore. However, the Samuel Beckett-class vessels, including LÉ &quot;Samuel Beckett&quot; (commissioned 17 May 2014), LÉ &quot;James Joyce&quot; (commissioned in September 2015), LÉ &quot;William Butler Yeats&quot; (commissioned 17 October 2016) and LÉ &quot;George Bernard Shaw&quot; (commissioned 30 April 2019) took their names from Irish literary figures. The ship prefix &quot;LÉ&quot; stands for &quot;Long Éireannach&quot;, &quot;Irish Ship&quot; in the Irish language. In 2024, the traditional naming conventions was restored with the naming of LÉ &quot;Aoibhinn&quot; and LÉ &quot;Gobnait&quot; who were commissioned in September 2024.

=== Current fleet ===

=== Other assets ===

The Naval Service also operates smaller training vessels and rigid-hulled inflatable boats.

Air assets to support naval patrols are provided by the Air Corps with their two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft and AW139 helicopters operated from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, County Dublin.

In July 2015, the Irish Naval Service began using an Irish-based satellite communications system for its fleet, with new systems and equipment installed on all vessels. The Irish National Space Centre (NSC) at Elfordstown, Midleton, County Cork, and County Wicklow based company Voyager IP provided the contract.

=== Acquisitions and future ===

In October 2010, contracts were signed for two new &quot;offshore patrol vessels&quot; (OPVs). The contract provided an option for a third vessel – which was later taken-up. A fourth vessel in the same class was ordered in June 2016. Constructed by Babcock Marine in the UK to VARD Marine&#x27;s PV90 design, the first ship, &quot;Samuel Beckett&quot;, was delivered in May 2014. The second ship, &quot;James Joyce&quot;, was delivered in 2015. The third, &quot;William Butler Yeats&quot;, was floated out in March 2016 and delivered later that summer. A fourth, named &quot;George Bernard Shaw&quot;, was delivered in late 2018, and commissioned in April 2019. These &quot;Samuel Beckett&quot;-class OPVs replaced older vessel classes, such as the .

A number of these purchases were informed by a Whitepaper on Defence which expected acquisition of three new naval vessels over 10 years from 2015 to 2025. As well as the acquired and ordered OPVs, the whitepaper covered a multi-role vessel (MRV) – which would be potentially enabled for helicopter operations and have a freight carrying capacity – to replace the flagship LÉ &quot;Eithne&quot;.

In 2017, a delegation of Department of Defence (DoD) officials and members of the Defence Forces visited New Zealand to inspect the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) multi-role vessel ; it was suggested that a vessel of this type, capable of accommodating and deploying a full infantry company either by landing craft or helicopter, and with a fully equipped hospital, was what the Defence Forces needed for the type of military and humanitarian missions undertaken by Ireland. Plans expected that LÉ &quot;Ciara&quot; and LÉ &quot;Orla&quot; be replaced with similar vessels, but with counter-mine and counter-IED capabilities. In August 2021, the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; reported that the DoD was considering acquiring two former RNZN Lake-class inshore patrol vessels. These vessels would be based on the east coast and operate mainly in the Irish Sea with the primary role of fisheries protection in light of Brexit.

On 14 March 2022, the DoD announced the acquisition of two such retired RNZN vessels, HMNZS &quot;Rotoiti&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Pukaki&quot;, for €26 million, to replace LÉ &quot;Orla&quot; and LÉ &quot;Ciara&quot; and with the expectation that they would require less crew to operate. Intended to enter service in 2024, the two vessels arrived in Ireland in May 2023. On 5 April 2024, the DoD announced that the new vessels would be named LÉ &quot;Aoibhinn&quot; and LÉ &quot;Gobnait&quot;. On 4 September 2024, the two vessels were commissioned into service.

<doc id="1179278" wikidata="Q263460" url="?curid=1179278" title="The Dead Pool">
<text>The Dead Pool is a 1988 American action-thriller film directed by Buddy Van Horn, written by Steve Sharon, and starring Clint Eastwood as Inspector &quot;Dirty&quot; Harry Callahan. It is the fifth and final film in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film series and is set in San Francisco, California.

The story concerns the manipulation of a dead pool game by a serial killer, whose efforts are confronted by the hardened detective Callahan. It co-stars Liam Neeson (in his first action film) and Patricia Clarkson, with Jim Carrey in his first dramatic role. The film also features an appearance by future Mario voice actor Charles Martinet.

It is the only film in the series not to feature Albert Popwell, an actor who had played a different character in each of the previous four films, as well as the only one to be recorded in Dolby Stereo.

At 91 minutes, it is the shortest of the five &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films. Like those films, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; is notable for coining catchphrases uttered by Clint Eastwood&#x27;s gun-wielding character, one of which is: &quot;Opinions are like assholes; everybody has one&quot;.

== Plot ==
Inspector Harry Callahan&#x27;s testimony against crime lord Lou Janero puts the mobster in prison. Now famous, Callahan becomes the target of Janero&#x27;s men as well as the news media, both of which he dislikes. After Callahan kills four hitmen during an ambush, the SFPD assigns Al Quan as his partner; Callahan advises him to get a bulletproof vest, as his partners often get killed. The pair investigate the fatal heroin overdose of rock singer Johnny Squares, found in his trailer during filming of a music video directed by Peter Swan at the Port of San Francisco. Squares&#x27; death was not a typical overdose, but actually murder.

Dean Madison, Swan&#x27;s producer, is killed during a robbery in Chinatown. Callahan kills three of the robbers, and Quan captures the fourth. They discover a list in Madison&#x27;s pocket with Callahan and Squares&#x27; names on it. It is revealed that Madison and Swan are participants in a &quot;dead pool&quot; game, in which participants predict celebrity deaths in the San Francisco Bay Area: whether by accident, violence or natural causes. Movie critic Molly Fisher, also on Swan&#x27;s list, is soon murdered by an intruder claiming to be Swan, causing panic among the surviving celebrities and making Swan a suspect.

After Callahan destroys a television station&#x27;s camera, he must cooperate with reporter Samantha Walker to avoid a lawsuit; if he agrees to a profile of his controversial career, the suit will be dropped. Callahan sees this as a ploy to exploit the danger he is in for its ratings value. Yet after they survive another attack by Janero&#x27;s men, the incident and her own unwillingness to be the subject of news coverage cause Walker to reconsider the dangers police officers face in juxtaposition with the public&#x27;s right to know.

Meanwhile, at San Quentin State Prison, Callahan uses triple murderer Butcher Hicks to threaten the imprisoned Janero if anything happens to him. Janero ends the attacks and assigns two men to Callahan as his personal bodyguards, though Callahan initially thinks they are after him.

An attention-seeker named Gus Wheeler, falsely claiming responsibility for the murders, douses himself in gasoline and threatens to light himself on fire in front of a large crowd. Walker foils his ploy by refusing to film him; Wheeler accidentally sets himself on fire, but Callahan saves him. Impressed by Walker&#x27;s refusal to exploit Wheeler, Callahan becomes close with her. Meanwhile, Swan tells Callahan and Quan about Harlan Rook, a deranged fan suffering from &quot;process schizophrenia&quot; who thinks the director stole his ideas and work; Swan has a restraining order against him.

Rook kills television personality Nolan Kennard, another person on the dead pool list, using a radio-controlled car filled with C4 explosive under the victim&#x27;s vehicle. Callahan finds a toy car wheel at the crime scene, and later sees another toy car following him and Quan. Recognizing the threat, they flee through the city pursued by the toy car, controlled by Rook while driving his own car at the same time. Trapped in an alleyway, Rook sends the car in armed. Callahan is able to back the car up enough so the engine takes most of the blast. Both survive, but Quan has broken ribs; Harry later finds out Quan was wearing a bulletproof vest, on the recommendation of his father to take Harry&#x27;s advice.

Rook, claiming to be Swan, calls Walker at the television station and invites her to Swan&#x27;s film studio for an interview. Rook kills the cameraman and kidnaps Samantha. The police discover at Rook&#x27;s apartment torn posters of Swan&#x27;s films, large quantities of explosives, and Walker&#x27;s name replacing Callahan&#x27;s on the dead pool list. At the studio, Callahan confronts Rook holding Walker hostage. The detective surrenders his .44 Magnum revolver after Rook threatens to slit her throat. Callahan lures Rook to a pier after a chase during which Rook shoots at him with his own gun. Rook runs out of bullets, and Callahan shoots Rook with a Svend Foyn harpoon cannon, impaling him. Callahan retrieves his gun and leaves with Walker just as the police and news media arrive.

== Cast ==
Members of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses make uncredited cameo appearances at the funeral of Johnny Squares. They also appear during filming of a &quot;nightmare scene&quot; at the docks, where guitarist Slash fires a harpoon gun through a window and is berated by Swan.

== Production ==
Eastwood reacted to starring in another &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film, &quot;It&#x27;s fun, once in a while, to have a character you can go back to. It&#x27;s like revisiting an old friend you haven&#x27;t seen for a long time. You figure &#x27;I&#x27;ll go back and see how he feels about things now.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; was filmed in February and March 1988 in San Francisco.

=== Car chase ===
Callahan is pursued through San Francisco&#x27;s hilly streets in his unmarked Oldsmobile 98 squad car by a miniature R/C car (assembled and controlled by Rook) containing an R/C bomb for Rook to detonate. The R/C car used for the film was a highly modified Team Associated RC10 electric race buggy powered by a Reedy motor that had to be geared up high to an 8.4v NiCd battery, topped with an off-the-shelf 1963 Chevrolet Corvette R/C car body by Parma International. The RC10 had its suspension lowered from the original to a lower ground clearance for better high-speed stability. Needing the best R/C car driver to control the RC10 action, Van Horn hired the 1985 IFMAR 1:10 Electric Off-Road World Champion Jay Halsey. At first, Van Horn was unsure if the RC10 could keep up with the Oldsmobile, so for the scene where both vehicles start from the top of the hill, the director allowed both cars to start off together. As a result, the RC10 outran the Oldsmobile, so the scene had to be re-filmed with the Oldsmobile reaching the bottom first. At one point in a scene where the cars interact, the RC10 jumps over the Oldsmobile, lands, and then proceeds to the end of the street to wait for the Oldsmobile. One scene, in which Halsey was only required to drive the RC10 at full speed to where the bomb was to be detonated, required over a week to film. A motorized tricycle with a camera mounted at ground level was used for close-up filming of the RC10 in action. Engine sound effects for the electric-motor RC10 were added in post-production.

The chase scenes have many similarities with the famous car-chase in the Steve McQueen film &quot;Bullitt&quot;, which Eastwood has said was his favorite part of the McQueen film. The necessity of closing down various continuously busy city streets meant that the sequences tend to jump from district to district, much as the similar scenes did in the McQueen film, making for a number of continuity errors that are easily overlooked during the fast-paced scenes, just as the motorcycle chase-scenes in the second Dirty Harry film (&quot;Magnum Force&quot;) jumped around but are seldom mentioned.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Dead Pool&quot; holds a 53% approval rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. Its critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;While it offers its fair share of violent thrills and tough wit, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; ends the Dirty Harry series on an uninspired note.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that it was &quot;as good as the original &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;,&quot; praising it as &quot;smart, quick, and made with real wit&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also awarded three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;the second best of the series, beaten only by the 1971 original&quot;, explaining that &quot;where the previous sequels have been mostly dour gun blasts, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; is a thriller with wit and humour and tension.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;possesses a couple of good jokes, but nothing can disguise the fact that it&#x27;s a mini-movie in the company of a mythic figure&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;From the original on, Harry has always been a fantasy character but his stories have been involving. Here, he remains absurdly separated from reality in an exceedingly lame yarn that lurches from one shootout to the next.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Along with the 1976 {entry} &quot;The Enforcer&quot;, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; is among the weakest of the entire &#x27;Dirty Harry&#x27; series. With its stylized story-line and almost style-less direction, it sometimes resembles a juggling act with sledgehammers.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Unless you&#x27;re a Clint fan (and — own up — who isn&#x27;t?) there&#x27;s little other reason to sit through this one. Eastwood, who&#x27;s had far bigger concerns recently, such as directing a movie about jazz great Charlie Parker, seems content to mark time. And pick up another cheque.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;The Dead Pool&quot; was released in United States theatres July 1988. In its opening weekend, the film took $9,071,330 in 1988 cinemas in the US, at an average of $4,563. In total in the US, the film made $37,903,295, making it the least profitable of the five films in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series.

=== End of film series ===
Eastwood has publicly announced that he has no interest in acting in another &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film. In 2000, he jokingly spoke about potential sequels: &quot;&quot;Dirty Harry VI&quot;! Harry is retired. He&#x27;s standing in a stream, fly-fishing. He gets tired of using the pole— and BA-BOOM! Or Harry is retired, and he catches bad guys with his walker?&quot;

<text>William Cookson (8 May 1939–2 January 2003) was a British poet, writer on poetry and literary editor, best known for his poetry magazine &quot;Agenda&quot;, regarded as one of the most influential of its age.

He was brought up in Surrey and London, and educated at Westminster School and New College, Oxford. At 16, he started a correspondence with Ezra Pound, who started mentoring him and introducing him to his network of contacts. In October 1958, aged 19, he travelled to Italy to meet him, and as a result of this visit, decided to become an editor, launching his magazine &quot;Agenda&quot;, in January 1959. Initially, &quot;Agenda&quot; continued Pound&#x27;s economic and political ideas at the time of composing &quot;Thrones&quot; (1959). However, after a year of experimenting, Cookson reoriented his magazine towards contemporary poetry, and stayed faithful to this direction until his death in 2003. Politically, he became a socialist. In artistic terms, Cookson remained devoted to Pound throughout his life, and his magazine is an important link in the reception of Pound&#x27;s poetry in the UK. This should not obscure the main merit of &quot;Agenda&quot;, namely that it followed the development of late modernist poetry in Britain and America, correlating it both with tradition and with poetries all over the world, through translations, reviews and essays. Cookson dedicated whole issues of &quot;Agenda&quot; to key British poets such as David Jones, Geoffrey Hill, Thom Gunn and Basil Bunting, building reference points for their poetry.

Cookson also edited a volume of Pound&#x27;s &quot;Selected Prose&quot; (1973), and published &quot;A Guide to The Cantos of Ezra Pound&quot; (1985, 2001).

On Cookson&#x27;s death a &quot;Celebratory Issue&quot; of &quot;Agenda&quot; (Vol. 39, No. 4 (2003)) was published in which his successor as editor of the journal, Patricia McCarthy, described him as &quot;a man who sacrificed his life for poetry and was perhaps the best, most single-minded editor of our day&quot;. In addition to a final redaction of &quot;Vestiges and Versions&quot;, the issue contains biographical sketches by Edmund Gray and Martin Dodsworth.

<doc id="1179285" wikidata="Q7886129" url="?curid=1179285" title="Union Street, Plymouth">
<text>Union Street in Plymouth, Devon, is a long straight street connecting the city centre to Devonport, the site of Plymouth&#x27;s naval base and docks. Originally the home of wealthy people, it later became an infamous red-light district and the location of most of the city&#x27;s night-life.

==History==
Designed by John Foulston, it was laid out between 1812 and 1820 as a grand boulevard to connect the three towns of Plymouth, East Stonehouse and Devonport. Today Union Street forms part of the A374.

For some years after its construction, Union Street was the home of the wealthy. According to a guidebook of 1823:

Despite its upper-class associations, Union Street was the location of the first outbreaks in Plymouth of cholera in the 1849 epidemic. At the time, these outbreaks in July of that year were believed to be caused by works connected with the new Millbay railway station, during which the drains of several houses had become blocked and their lower premises overflowed with sewage.

It was the continuing development along and around Union Street that led to the merger of the Three Towns in 1914, and the granting of Plymouth&#x27;s city status in 1928.

Frequented by sailors from all over the world, it was once known as one of the West Country&#x27;s most infamous streets and red-light districts. Much of the area was destroyed by German bombing in World War II, more by widening and slum clearance work.

==The Palace Theatre==

In 1898 the Palace Theatre opened as a music hall in Union Street. It was damaged by fire only eight months after opening, but re-opened in 1899 as the New Palace Theatre of Varieties. In 1961 it was converted to a bingo hall and continued in this use and as a theatre until 1983 when it became &quot;The Academy&quot; disco.

In May 2006 a police operation showed that class A drugs were being used and dealt there, and it closed as a result. The building is grade II listed, and in 2008 it was included on a list by the Victorian Society of the UK&#x27;s ten most endangered and best Victorian and Edwardian buildings.

==Present condition and future plan==
The environment of Union Street - although designated as a local conservation area is now considerably dilapidated following the closure of the majority of the night leisure businesses in an attempt to control the associated problems of late-night violence and drunkenness. The broken and collapsed historic frontage has fallen into considerable disrepair and many of the businesses associated with servicing the nighttime economy are now vacant. Some limited new developments consist of new housing, low-cost supermarkets and a few remaining late night venues. Despite the conservation area status, modern developments have not attempted to respect the original historic urban design, with retail parking taking up much of the newer street frontage with higher profile developments more aligned with the aspirations of the Plymouth Plan which are focussed toward the development of links between the city centre and Millbay immediately to the south. It has a noticeable police presence late at night and early into the morning, to control drunk and lively people. As of 2002, it was also patrolled by military police to maintain a degree of integrity among sailors and marines, though it is less frequented by service personnel than it once was.

==In song==
&quot;Union Street (Last Post)&quot; is a track on the 2006 album &quot;Witness&quot; by contemporary West Country folk duo Show of Hands. It tells a tale of love and loss amongst the pubs and clubs of Union Street at the time of the Falklands Conflict.

<text>Primrose Hill was a railway station in Chalk Farm, in the London Borough of Camden, opened by the North London Railway as Hampstead Road in 1855. It was named Chalk Farm from 1862 until 1950, when it was given its final name. From the 1860s to 1915, it was linked with a formerly separate station opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1852. The station closed in 1992, and the platform buildings and canopies were removed in 2008.

==History==
The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) opened its station as &quot;Camden&quot; on 1 May 1852. It replaced an earlier station of the same name to the south-east that had opened on 1 November 1851. The station was the first station out of Euston on the West Coast Main Line. In 1866, the LNWR&#x27;s station&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Camden (Chalk Farm)&quot; and it was resited to the north-west on 1 April 1872 to provide a better connection to the NLR&#x27;s station. In 1876, the name was changed to &quot;Chalk Farm&quot; to match the NLR&#x27;s station.

The North London Railway (NLR) opened the station as &quot;Hampstead Road&quot; on 5 May 1855, replacing an earlier station of the same name to the east. The station was renamed &quot;Chalk Farm&quot; on 1 December 1862, and resited to the west, with four new platforms completed on 24 May 1872. From the 1860s the two stations were linked with a footbridge across the tracks. The LNWR platforms closed on 10 May 1915. The NLR platforms closed on 1 January 1917 for wartime economy measures. On 10 July 1922 the NLR reopened two of its station platforms along with the LNWR&#x27;s platforms.
 After the station&#x27;s reopening in 1922, the passenger service was usually provided during peak hours only running between Broad Street and Watford Junction. After Broad Street closed in 1986 the service ran from Liverpool Street. The station was scheduled to close when the Liverpool Street to Watford Junction service was discontinued, but ended early due to flooding. The last eastbound train called at Primrose Hill on 18 September 1992 and the last westbound train called on 22 September 1992. The area is served by the nearby station on the London Underground&#x27;s Northern line.

On 25 September 1950, the station was renamed &quot;Primrose Hill&quot;.

The station building was closed in 1987 but remains and is occupied by a business. It is on Regent&#x27;s Park Road at one end of the footbridge over the railway tracks. The platform canopies and the buildings supporting them were demolished by Network Rail in December 2008.
The nearby Primrose Hill Tunnels, East Portals, and the Western Entrance, have both been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since 1974.

<text>Major-General Sir Robert Bellew Adams (Muree, Punjab, India, 26 July 1856 – 13 February 1928, Inverness) was a Scottish general of the Indian Army and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Robert Bellew Adams, the son of an officer of the Corps of Guides regiment of the Indian Army, entered the Army in 1876 as a sub-lieutenant in the 12th Foot (later the Suffolk Regiment). His promotion to lieutenant in 1878 was backdated to 1876. He transferred to the Bengal Staff Corps in 1879, served with his father&#x27;s regiment in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and was promoted to captain in 1887. In 1891 he was appointed to command the cavalry of the Guides. He took part in the Chitral expedition and afterwards was promoted to major in 1896 and brevet lieutenant colonel &quot;in recognition of his services during the operations of the Chitral Relief Force, 1895.&quot;

In 1897 the Guides took part in the Tirah campaign, and the following event took place:

Lieutenant Greaves was acting as war correspondent for &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Viscount Fincastle was also acting as a war correspondent, for &quot;The Times&quot;. A fuller account is given by Winston Churchill in &quot;The Story of the Malakand Field Force&quot;.

Adams and Fincastle were awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). At that time the VC was not awarded posthumously, and the &quot;London Gazette&quot; noted &quot;Lieutenant Hector Lachlan Stewart MacLean, Indian Staff Corps, on account of his gallant conduct as recorded above, would have been recommended to Her Majesty for the Victoria Cross had he survived.&quot; MacLean was awarded a posthumous VC in 1907 after the policy had been changed.

During the same campaign Adams was mentioned in despatches three times and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In 1899 he was appointed to the command of the Guides, and in September 1901 he was appointed aide-de-camp to King Edward VII and received the brevet rank of colonel. Promotion to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel followed on 11 September 1902. In June 1904 he was promoted to temporary brigadier general and given the command of the Umballa Cavalry Brigade. In March 1906 he was promoted to major-general and transferred to the Derajat Brigade, but due to illness he resigned the command in 1908. He was invalided out of the army in 1911 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1912.

Adams died in retirement at Inverness in February 1928 at the age of 71. After cremation in Maryhill, Glasgow, his ashes were buried at Tomnahuich Cemetery, Inverness.

==Family==
Adams was unmarried. He was the second cousin of Edward Donald Bellew, a Canadian WWI VC recipient.

<doc id="1179306" wikidata="Q1423573" url="?curid=1179306" title="White Hunter Black Heart">
<text>White Hunter Black Heart is a 1990 American adventure drama film produced, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. It is based on the 1953 book of the same name written by Peter Viertel, who cowrote the screenplay with James Bridges and Burt Kennedy. The screenplay was the last that Bridges wrote before his death in 1993.

The film is a thinly disguised account of Viertel&#x27;s experiences while working on the 1951 film &quot;The African Queen&quot;, which was filmed on location in Africa at a time when foreign location shoots for American films were rare. The main character, brash director John Wilson (played by Eastwood) is based on real-life director John Huston. Jeff Fahey plays Pete Verrill, a character based on Viertel. George Dzundza&#x27;s character is based on &quot;African Queen&quot; producer Sam Spiegel. Marisa Berenson&#x27;s character Kay Gibson and Richard Vanstone&#x27;s character Phil Duncan are based on Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, respectively.

==Plot==
In the early 1950s, Pete Verrill is invited by his friend, director John Wilson, to rewrite the script for Wilson&#x27;s latest project: a film with the working title of &quot;The African Trader&quot;. The hard living, irreverent Wilson convinces producer Paul Landers to have the film completely shot on location in Africa, even though doing so would be extremely expensive. Wilson explains to Verrill that his motivation for this has nothing to do with the film - Wilson, a lifelong hunter, wants to fulfill his dream of going on an African safari; he even purchases a set of finely crafted hunting rifles and charges them to the studio.

Upon landing in Entebbe, Wilson and Verrill spend several days at a luxury hotel while Verrill finishes the script and Wilson makes arrangements for the safari. Verrill finds himself growing fond of Wilson after the latter defends him against a fellow guest who makes antisemitic remarks in front of Verrill (who happens to be Jewish) and challenges the hotel manager to a fistfight after witnessing him insult and belittle a black waiter for spilling a drink. The two men constantly argue over Verrill&#x27;s changes to the script, particularly his insistence that Wilson does not use his original planned ending, where all of the main characters are killed on-screen.

Wilson hires a pilot to fly him and Verrill out to the hunting camp of safari guide Zibelinsky and his African tracker Kivu, whom Wilson is quick to bond with. The film&#x27;s unit director, Ralph Lockhart, is also present and insists that Wilson start pre-production before the cast arrives, to which Wilson replies he&#x27;ll do so after he shoots a &quot;tusker&quot;. Verrill gradually becomes disenchanted with Wilson, who keeps going out to hunt despite his poor health and seems completely indifferent to the success of his movie. He even questions why Wilson would want to kill such a magnificent beast.

Confronted, Wilson tells Verrill off and accuses him of &quot;playing it safe&quot; and not wanting to risk anything. He calls hunting a &quot;sin that you can get a license for&quot; and doesn&#x27;t try to convince Verrill otherwise when he threatens to resign and go back to London. Landers arrives in Entebbe and insists that Verrill stay on, revealing that the studio is at risk of bankruptcy if the movie isn&#x27;t finished. When Verrill does return, he is informed by Lockhart that Wilson, without consulting anyone, has decided to move the entire production to Kivu&#x27;s home village despite Landers spending most of the budget on a prefabricated set.

The cast, now unable to stay at the hotel, go to Zibelinsky&#x27;s camp and find Wilson waiting for them with a lavish banquet. He humiliates Landers and takes advantage of several days of rain to resume his safari, now accompanied by professional elephant hunter Ogilvy. Verrill follows after Wilson again taunts him for cowardice. Wilson finally gets his chance to kill the &quot;tusker&quot;, but when the time comes to shoot, he suddenly finds he can&#x27;t pull the trigger. The elephant suddenly charges after seeing its child move too close to Wilson, and Kivu tries to scare it off only to be fatally gored by the elephant&#x27;s tusks.

Wilson, horrified by Kivu&#x27;s death, returns to the set. He sees the villagers beating drums and asks Ogilvy what they mean. Ogilvy replies that they are communicating to everyone how Kivu died: &quot;white hunter, black heart&quot;. Recognizing that he is ultimately to blame for what happened, Wilson tells Verrill that he was right: the film does need a happy ending after all. Sitting in his director&#x27;s chair as the actors and crew take their places to film the opening scene of &quot;The African Trader&quot;, a now humbled Wilson silently mutters &quot;Action&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
During the 1950s, Ray Bradbury wrote an unproduced version of the film for MGM. In 1974, Columbia Pictures advertised the film as being readied for production to be directed by Bridges and produced by Ted Richmond.

At times, Eastwood, as the John Huston-like character of John Wilson, can be heard drawing out his vowels, speaking in Huston&#x27;s distinctive style.

The film was shot on location in Kariba, Zimbabwe, and surrounds including at Lake Kariba, Victoria Falls, and Hwange, over two months in the summer of 1989. Some interiors were shot in and around Pinewood Studios in England. The boat used in the film was constructed in England of glass fiber and shipped to Africa for filming. It was electrically powered, and was fitted with motors and engines by special-effects expert John Evans to make the boat appear to be steam-powered. The elephant gun used in the film was a £65,000 double-barreled rifle of the type preferred by most professional hunters and their clients in this era. It was made by Holland &amp; Holland, the gunmakers who also made the gun used by Huston when he was in Africa for &quot;The African Queen&quot; in 1951. The &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; filmmakers took great care with the gun and sold it back to Holland &amp; Holland after filming &quot;unharmed, unscratched, unused.&quot;

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Janet Maslin wrote:In fact, this material marks a gutsy, fascinating departure for Mr. Eastwood, and makes it clear that his directorial ambitions have by now outstripped his goals as an actor. &#x27;White Hunter, Black Heart,&#x27; even when not entirely successful, goes far beyond the particulars of Huston&#x27;s adventures and explores Mr. Eastwood&#x27;s own thoughts about artistry in general, film making in particular and hubris in all its many forms. ... And none of it works as fully as Mr. Eastwood obviously wants it to, as a consequence of the sheer sweep and colorfulness of the man being portrayed. But even in this relatively stiff, sometimes awkward form, the John Wilson character is as compelling as Mr. Eastwood&#x27;s desire to play him.&quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; was entered in the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.

The film has an 83% positive rating on review-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, and the consensus reads: &quot;&quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; is powerful, intelligent, and subtly moving, a fascinating meditation on masculinity and the insecurities of artists.&quot;

Jim Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; hailed &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot; as &quot;Eastwood’s best work before &quot;Unforgiven&quot;...[an] underrated hall-of-mirrors movie about movie-inspired megalomania.&quot; The film has also been retrospectively praised by critics such as Dave Kehr and Jonathan Rosenbaum.

===Box office===
&quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot;&#x27;s gross theatrical earnings reached just over $2 million, well below the film&#x27;s $24 million budget.

<text>The 1905 VFL season was the ninth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 6 May to 30 September, comprising a 17-match home-and-away season followed by a three-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by 13 points in the 1905 VFL grand final; it was Fitzroy&#x27;s second consecutive premiership and fourth VFL premiership overall. Collingwood won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 15–2 win–loss record. Collingwood&#x27;s Charlie Pannam won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1905, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 14 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1905 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;&quot;Argus&quot; system&quot;.

==Season notes==
* Collingwood used only 24 players to play its nineteen games – the smallest number of players to represent one club in a VFL/AFL season.
* The Australasian Football Council was formed.
* VFL decides to pay field umpires 30 shillings per match, and boundary umpires seven shillings per match (approx $75.00 and $20.00 in 2008 buying power).

==Awards==
* The 1905 VFL Premiership team was Fitzroy.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Charlie Pannam of Collingwood with 38 goals.
* Melbourne took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1905.

<doc id="1179324" wikidata="Q4970920" url="?curid=1179324" title="British Rail Classes 445 and 446">
<text>The PEP (Prototype Electro Pneumatic Train) Stock were prototype electric multiple units used on British Rail&#x27;s Southern and Scottish Regions during the 1970s and early 1980s. They were forerunners of the British Rail &quot;Second Generation&quot; electric multiple unit fleet. Three units were built, one two-car unit (2001), and two four-car units (4001/4002). Under TOPS, the driving cars were originally classified as Class 461 with the non-driving motor cars as Class 462. They were later reclassified as Class 445 (4PEP) and Class 446 (2PEP).

Internal layout was for commuter services; low-backed, bus-style 2+2 seating in open saloons, wide gangways with hanging straps, and no lavatory facilities. They were the first electric multiple units designed by British Rail with electric sliding doors, outside the Scottish Region. They were unable to operate with any other stock due to their new coupling system. Externally, 2001 was finished in unpainted aluminium, while 4001/4002 were painted in all-over Rail Blue. In passenger use, they normally operated together as a ten-car formation.

==Design==
On the 4-PEP units the non-driving cars were powered, similar to London Underground practice at the time, but a departure from previous British Railways designs where there had not been any 4-car units with all axles powered. Also introduced for the first time was rheostatic braking with cam-controlled analogue logic, and fluorescent lighting working at 50 Hz. Interior design was open saloons with 2+2 seating, although this was not considered to be finalised until after trial running, and also included communicating doors between coaches and between units, with the driving cars having 2 pairs of sliding doors each and 3 pairs on the non-driving coaches.

==Passenger use==

All three units were initially assigned to the South Western Division of the Southern Region, based at Wimbledon Park and Strawberry Hill. Upon arrival, they were used under an extensive testing programme prior to entering full passenger service in June 1973, on services from Waterloo to , and . In August 1973, all three units were moved to the South Eastern Division, where they worked services from Cannon Street/ to , and . Although capable of being used as a single 10-car formation on the SED, a number of failures saw them returned to the SWD after a month.

==Departmental use==
After the units were withdrawn from passenger service, they continued to be used by the Research department for further tests. For this purpose, the units and individual carriages were all renumbered into the departmental series. The two Class 446 power cars were teamed with a newly built pantograph trailer and became TOPS Class 920, number 920001. This was then used for the development of Classes 313–315. The two Class 445 four car sets became TOPS Class 935, numbered 056 and 057 in the Southern Region departmental (non-revenue earning) unit series. 056 saw little use, being stored at Wimbledon Park until June 1980, when it was transferred to the Railway Technical Centre at Derby.

==Production classes==
The production-run classes which are most visibly similar to the prototype Stock are the dual voltage 750 V DC / 25 kV AC Class 313, the 25 kV AC Classes 314 and 315, and the 750 V DC Classes 507 and 508. It was also planned that the rolling stock for the services through the proposed Picc-Vic tunnel, intended as Class 316, would have formed part of the PEP family. However, subsequent builds have also drawn heavily on the experience gained by this stock.

The PEP units had three sets of sliding doors on each of the non-driving cars for handling dense inner-suburban traffic. However, the Class 313 and all subsequent builds, including later Mark 3-based units, have only had two sets of doors per car.

==Disposal==

All three units were finally taken out of use in the mid-1980s. None of the cars have survived; 920001 was scrapped in 1987, 056 in 1986 and 057 in 1990.

==Formations==
The unit formations in passenger and departmental service were:

<text>William Robert Fountaine Addison (18 September 1883 – 7 January 1962) was an English Anglican priest and army chaplain. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
William Addison was born in North Warnborough, Hampshire, on 18 September 1883 to William Grylis Addison and Alice Addison. He was educated at Odiham Grammar School, Odiham, Hants. The family moved to Kent when he was 13, leading British government authorities to believe he had been born in Kent until the error was revealed by the chair of the Odiham branch of the Royal British Legion. After his father&#x27;s death in 1904, he moved to Canada, where he worked as a farmer and a lumberjack. He returned to England in 1909 and became a farmer in Devon, saving up money to train for the priesthood. He entered Salisbury Theological College in 1911, and was admitted as a student in theology at Durham University (to which Salisbury was an associated theological college) in Easter term 1912, passing the first year examination in theology in the same term. He was ordained at Salisbury Cathedral in May 1913 and became curate of St Edmund&#x27;s Church, Salisbury (now closed).

==First World War==
Upon the outbreak of First World War, he volunteered for the Army Chaplain&#x27;s Department. He became a Temporary Chaplain of the Forces, 4th Class in the Army Chaplain&#x27;s Department, British Army, and was 32 years old when the deed took place on 9 April 1916 at Sanna-i-Yat, Mesopotamia, for which he was awarded the VC &quot;for most conspicuous bravery&quot;:

:He carried a wounded man to the cover of a trench, and assisted several others to the same cover, after binding up their wounds under heavy rifle and machine gun fire.
:In addition to these unaided efforts, by his splendid example and utter disregard of personal danger, he encouraged the stretcher-bearers to go forward under heavy fire and collect the wounded.
==Later life==
Addison was a Freemason and was initiated into Aldershot Camp Lodge No. 1331 on 14 November 1923.

After the war, he continued as an army chaplain and served at Malta, Khartoum and Shanghai and at army bases in England. He was Senior Chaplain to the Forces from 1934 to 1938, when he left the army and became a parish priest. He was rector of Coltishall with Great Hautbois in Norfolk from 1938 to 1958. On the outbreak of World War II he returned to the army and again served as Senior Chaplain to the Forces. He died in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, and is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.

A replica set of Addison&#x27;s medals is on display at the Museum of Army Chaplaincy, and at Sarum College in Salisbury.

<text>The Lynn River is a fresh water river located in Norfolk County in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It empties into Lake Erie at Port Dover.

==Summary==

The Lynn Valley Trail follows the river between Port Dover and the town of Simcoe. It is possible to kayak down the Lynn River to the outskirts of Port Dover. The watershed stretches throughout Norfolk County and is one of few cold water tributaries feeding into the Eastern Lake Erie basin.

A small waterfall can be found on the Port Dover side of the Lynn River. However, the waterfall is surrounded by private property; making roadside viewing the only safe and legal way to view the waterfall. Stately homes can be found along the Lynn River; some with prices fetching up to nearly $3,000,000 on the open real estate market.

While the quality of the surface water is slightly above provincial average when it comes to cleanliness, the conditions of the surrounding forests are well below average when compared to the rest of Ontario.

Communities that are dependent on the Lynn River for their primary water supply include Bloomsburg, Lynnville, Nixon, Colborne, Renton, Simcoe, Hillcrest, Bill&#x27;s Corners, Shand&#x27;s Corners and Port Dover.

Black Creek joins the Lynn River at Port Dover prior to draining into Lake Erie. The watershed drains approximately

<doc id="1179329" wikidata="Q380395" url="?curid=1179329" title="Richard Parkes Bonington">
<text>Richard Parkes Bonington (25 October 1802 – 23 September 1828) was an English Romantic landscape painter. He moved to France at the age of 14 and can also be considered as a French artist, and an intermediary bringing aspects of English style to France. Becoming, after his early death, one of the most influential British artists of his time, the facility of his style was inspired by the old masters, yet was entirely modern in its application. His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical cabinet paintings in a freely-handled version of the troubadour style.

==Life and work==
Richard Parkes Bonington was born in the town of Arnold, four miles from Nottingham. His father also known as Richard was successively a gaoler, a drawing master and lace-maker, and his mother a teacher. Bonington learned watercolour painting from his father and exhibited paintings at the Liverpool Academy at the age of eleven.

In 1817, Bonington&#x27;s family moved to Calais, France, where his father had set up a lace factory. At this time, Bonington started taking lessons from the painter François Louis Thomas Francia, who, having recently returned from England, where he had been deeply influenced by the work of Thomas Girtin, taught him the English watercolour technique. In 1818, the Bonington family moved to Paris to open a lace shop. There he met and became friends with Eugène Delacroix. He worked for a time producing copies of Dutch and Flemish landscapes in the Louvre. In 1820, he started attending the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros.

It was around this time that Bonington started going on sketching tours in the suburbs of Paris and the surrounding countryside. His first paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1822. He also began to work in oils and lithography, illustrating Baron Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Voyages pittoresques dans l&#x27;ancienne France&quot; and his own architectural series &quot;Restes et Fragmens&quot;. In 1824, he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1824 along with John Constable and Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding, and spent most of the year painting coastal views in Dunkirk.

In 1825 he met Delacroix on a visit with Alexandre-Marie Colin to London, and they sketched together there, and shared a studio for some months in Paris on their return; Delacroix influenced him in turning to historical painting. He also developed a technique mixing watercolour with gouache and gum, achieving an effect close to oil painting. His &quot;French Coast with Fisherman&quot; was one of the works he exhibited at the British Institution in February 1826 which established his reputation in his native England where he had previously been largely unknown. In 1826 he visited northern Italy, staying in Venice for a month, and London again in 1827–8. In late 1828 his tuberculosis worsened and his parents sent him back to London for treatment. Bonington died of tuberculosis on 23 September 1828 at 29 Tottenham Street in London, aged 25. He was buried in the graveyard of St James&#x27;s Chapel Pentonville and in 1837 his remains were transferred to Kensal Green Cemetery to be re-interred with his parents.

==Reputation==

Delacroix paid tribute to Bonington&#x27;s work in a letter to Théophile Thoré in 1861. It reads, in part:
When I met him for the first time, I too was very young and was making studies in the Louvre: this was around 1816 or 1817... Already in this genre (watercolor), which was an English novelty at that time, he had an astonishing ability... To my mind, one can find in other modern artists qualities of strength and of precision in rendering that are superior to those in Bonington&#x27;s pictures, but no one in this modern school, and perhaps even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, especially in watercolours, makes his works a type of diamond which flatters and ravishes the eye, independently of any subject and any imitation.

To Laurence Binyon however, &quot;Bonington&#x27;s extraordinary technical gift was also his enemy. There is none of the interest of struggle in his painting.&quot;

Beyond his watercolors, Bonington is known for his drawings with graphite pencil, particularly his elaborate cityscapes.

Bonington had a number of close followers, such as Roqueplan and Isabey in France, and Thomas Shotter Boys, James Holland, Edward Pritchett, William Callow and John Scarlett Davis in England. In addition, there were many copies and forgeries of his work made in the period immediately after his death.

A statue to him was erected outside the Nottingham School of Art by Watson Fothergill, and a theatre and primary school in his home town of Arnold are named after him. In addition, the house in which he was born (79 High Street, Arnold) is now named &#x27;Bonington House&#x27; and is Grade II listed. The Wallace Collection has an especially large group of 35 works, representing both his landscapes and history paintings.

<text>The 1906 VFL season was the tenth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 5 May to 22 September, comprising a 17-match home-and-away season followed by a two-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by 49 points in the 1906 VFL grand final; it was Carlton&#x27;s first VFL premiership. Carlton also won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 14–3 win–loss record. Carlton&#x27;s Mick Grace won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker, becoming the first player to kick 50 goals in a VFL season.

==Background==
In 1906, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 17 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1906 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;&quot;Argus&quot; system&quot;.

===Grand final===

==Season notes==
* In Round 4, St Kilda defeated Essendon for the first time in its history after 36 winless matches (15 in the VFA for four draws and 11 losses and 21 in the VFL for one draw and 20 losses) over 20 years of competition (1878 and 1888–1906).
* On Saturday 23 June, between Rounds 7 and 8, the VFL representative team 17.13 (115) defeated the Ballarat Football Association 10.10 (70) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Frank Caine kicked seven goals for Victoria. In the return game, held at the City Oval in Ballarat during the second week of Round 13 (11 August), the BFA 11.7 (73) defeated the VFL 6.7 (43); this VFL team was limited to players from , and , with the other five teams either playing or on interstate tours at the time. On 15 September, the weekend of the semi-finals, a VFL team selected from non-finalists defeated the Bendigo Football Association 15.14 (104) d. 2.2 (14) at the Upper Reserve in Bendigo.
* In Round 8, formally protested the result of its five point loss against , on the grounds that the timekeeper had rung the final bell thirty seconds prematurely. The protest was dismissed three weeks later owing to a lack of evidence.
* A vacant Saturday was originally scheduled on 11 August in the fixture between Rounds 13 and 14, to accommodate the second game against Ballarat and to allow clubs to complete interstate tours. However, after South Australian club Norwood&#x27;s tour was brought forward, the VFL turned Round 13 into a split round at less than two weeks notice, postponing the Carlton vs Fitzroy and St Kilda vs Melbourne games by a week.
* Mick Grace of Carlton was the first VFL player to score 50 goals in a season.

==Awards==
* The 1906 VFL Premiership team was Carlton.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Mick Grace of Carlton with 50 goals.
* Melbourne took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1906.

<text>Henryk Jerzy Chmielewski (7 June 1923 – 22 January 2021), also known under his pseudonym Papcio Chmiel, was a Polish comic book artist and journalist.

During World War II, Chmielewski served in the Home Army and took part in the Warsaw Uprising. After the war, he started working as a graphic artist in the &quot;Świat Młodych&quot; magazine, where he also published comics. Since the debut of his first &quot;Tytus, Romek i A&#x27;Tomek&quot; comic book in 1966, he focused his career almost entirely on this series, telling the story of Tytus de Zoo, an anthropomorphic, talking chimpanzee who wants to become a human. The last, thirty first book of the main series was published in 2008, but Chmielewski continued to create other works, such as artbooks, with his characters.

Chmielewski&#x27;s comics are known for the use of absurdist humour, puns and word plays. Aimed at children and teenagers, with the goal of being both entertaining and educational, his works often explore history (especially history of Poland), science, art or have the characters trying different professions.

==Early life and World War II==
Henryk Chmielewski was born on 7 June 1923 in Warsaw. During World War II, he was a member of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the Home Army &quot;Garłuch&quot; (). He took part in the Warsaw Uprising.

===Private life===
In 1949, he married Anna &quot;née&quot; Śliwińska. Together, they had daughter Monika (born 1951) and son Artur Bartłomiej (born 1957). They divorced in 1974. Chmielewski&#x27;s son Artur works at JPL.

Chmielewski died on the night of 22 January 2021.

==Career in &quot;Świat Przygód&quot; and &quot;Świat Młodych&quot;==
On 1 September 1947, Chmielewski started working as a graphic artist in the &quot;Świat Przygód&quot; (&quot;The World of Adventures&quot;), a magazine aimed at children and teenagers. The magazine was often publishing Western comic strips and parts of comic books translated to Polish, taken from foreign newspapers without asking for licensing copyright. One of the comics published in such manner was the American &quot;King of the Royal Mounted&quot;, copied from a Swedish magazine. Once &quot;Świat Przygód&quot; couldn&#x27;t obtain the newest issue of this newspaper, Chmielewski was asked to draw his own episodes of King&#x27;s adventures, so the magazine could avoid abruptly ending the series without explanation. Six such episodes were created, which Chmielewski counts as his debut as an comics author in his autobiography.

When Chmielewski was answering letters to the editor sent to his newspaper, he would write under the name Dziadzio Chmiel (&quot;Grandpa Hops&quot;, with the word &quot;chmiel&quot; taken from his surname). Chmielewski believed children would be more willing to write letters to a &quot;grandpa&quot;, than a 25-year-old he really was.

In January 1949, &quot;Świat Przygód&quot; was merged with &quot;Na Tropie&quot;, a scouting magazine, to form &quot;Świat Młodych&quot; (&quot;The World of Youth&quot;). At the same time, the magazine ceased publishing comics, since Poland was a Stalinist socialist country at that time and comics were viewed as an American form of art.

Between 1950 and 1956, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. After ending his studies in 1956, Chmielewski was thinking about becoming a poster artist, since publishing comics was still not possible. However, in the same year, following De-Stalinization in the Eastern Bloc and Gomułka&#x27;s thaw in Poland itself, he decided to try drawing comics once again. Chmielewski created ten single-page episodes of &quot;Romek i A&#x27;Tomek&quot; (&quot;Romek and A&#x27;Tomek&quot;, Romek and Tomek being pet forms of the names Roman and Tomasz), a black-and-white comic telling the story of two boys, the title characters, who accidentally fly into space in a rocket while visiting an &quot;astronautics exhibition&quot;. During the flight, the boys discover a talking space monkey called Tytus used for experiments. At that time, the characters&#x27; personalities were not yet developed, and the idea of humanizing Tytus as the main topic was not yet born.

The comic was not published immediately, as the &quot;Świat Młodych&quot; editor in chief was initially sceptical about it, fearing – despite the thaw – that publishing a comic might cause troubles with the Main Office of Control of Press, Publications and Shows (), which had the right to censor newspapers. Only after the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik 1 satellite on 4 October 1957, &quot;Świat Młodych&quot; decided to start publishing &quot;Romek i A&#x27;Tomek&quot;, because of its space-based storyline. The first episode debuted on the front cover of 22 October issue, although it was referred to as a &quot;picture story&quot; () rather than a comic. The characters became popular and Chmielewski started creating subsequent episodes (no longer set in space), under the title &quot;Tytus, Romek i A&#x27;Tomek&quot;. In 1964, he also launched the Klub Tytusa (&quot;Tytus Club&quot;) in &quot;Świat Młodych&quot;, with humorous articles presented as written by the chimpanzee himself.

==&quot;Tytus, Romek i A&#x27;Tomek&quot;==

In early 1965, after nine years of &quot;Tytus...&quot; as a newspaper comic in episodes, Wydawnictwo Harcerskie&#x27;s () director Janusz Maruszewski proposed to create a comic book with the characters. Since the publisher was only allowed to release scouting-related works, Chmielewski was given very specific instructions about the story: Romek and A&#x27;Tomek were planned to be members of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, who check whether Tytus might also become a scout. During the story, the main characters would also try to find their first jobs and earn money to visit a scout camp, learn about conserving historical monuments and fight with superstitions. The publishers ordered Chmielewski to create a comic which would give &quot;education through entertainment and entertainment through education&quot;.

After six months of drawing and getting the approval of the Main Office of Control of Press, &quot;Tytus harcerzem&quot; () debuted in 1966 in 30,000 copies, which were all sold within a week.

Although the comics were initially not planned to be a series, Chmielewski was asked to create a second book, this time dealing with traffic laws. &quot;Tytus otrzymuje prawko jazdy&quot; (&quot;Tytus gets a Driving License&quot;) debuted in 1967, in 50,000 copies, which were also sold-out very quickly. Following the success, Wydawnictwo Harcerskie ordered another three books: &quot;Tytus kosmonautą&quot; (&quot;Tytus the Cosmonaut&quot;, released in 1968), &quot;Tytus żołnierzem&quot; (&quot;Tytus the Soldier&quot;, 1969) and &quot;Podróż do ćwierć koła świata&quot; (&quot;Journey around a Quarter of the World&quot;, 1970).

In his later years, Chmielewski created &quot;albums&quot; (or artbooks) with his characters. Unlike comics, they have no plot, being composed of separate satirical pictures. The first album, featuring Tytus and his friends as soldiers during the Battle of Warsaw, was published in 2010.

===Common themes===
The main topic of the series is the &quot;humanization&quot; () of Tytus, that is, turning his intellect into that of a human being. This theme often serves as a pretence for including educational elements in the story. Chmielewski&#x27;s comics are known for the usage of word plays, such as puns and neologisms. One example is the name of his character A&#x27;Tomek, which is a portmanteau of the word atom and Tomek (Polish pet form of the name Tomasz).

===Publishers&#x27; influence===
Before the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989, the main topics and sometimes even specific adventures of the comics were not chosen by Chmielewski himself, but rather by his publishers. He was especially not fond of the theme of the second book, where the protagonists learn about rules of the road. While his publisher wanted a comic that would be mainly educational, Chmielewski wanted to focus on humorous situations. In a compromise solution, he created a board game about traffic laws, which was included in the middle of the book.

After Chmielewski created the fourth book, &quot;Tytus the Soldier&quot;, his publishers thought that drawing army vehicles in a cartoon way might be perceived as ridicule by the People&#x27;s Army of Poland, and hired another artist to draw realistic pictures of the vehicles and weaponry used by the Army. They were included, along with technical specifications, in the margins of the comic book.

While Chmielewski planned to portray a positive view of the United States in &quot;Journey Around a Quarter of the World&quot;, such as his characters becoming stuntmen in Hollywood, the publishers wanted to stress the existence of racism. They also proposed to include an episode where Tytus would meet partisans in fighting in the Angolan War of Independence. Chmielewski disagreed, saying that such issues are too serious for a humorous comic book. Nonetheless, in the final version of the book, the main characters witness a private-owned &quot;whites only&quot; beach in Miami.

==Awards==

For his involvement in World War II, especially the Warsaw Uprising, Chmielewski was awarded the Warsaw Cross of the Uprising in 1983, and the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2006.

For his artistic career, Chmielewski was awarded the Gloria Artis Medal for Merit for Culture, Gold Class (in 2007), the highest Polish order given for artistic deeds (with Gold Medal being its highest class). On the same day, two other comic book creators, Tadeusz Baranowski and Janusz Christa were also awarded, although with Silver Medals. It was the first time that comic book artists have received Gloria Artis.

In 2019, Chmielewski was awarded the by the President of Poland.
He was also a Knight of the Order of the Smile.

<text>The Democratic School of Hadera is a Democratic School in Hadera, Israel. It was founded in 1987 by Yaacov Hecht. With around 400 students aged four to eighteen, it is the largest of the twenty-six Israeli democratic schools.

The school is governed by a weekly school parliament in which all students, teachers, parents , and alumni have an equal vote. However, few parents and alumni participate in parliament meetings.

Students are free to decide if they want to attend classes or spend their time on other activities such as music, sports, art, computers, reading, talking, socializing, or doing nothing at all.

In 1993, the first International Democratic Education Conference (IDEC) was held at the Democratic School of Hadera. In the years 1996 and 2017, it was held again at that school.

<text>City2Surf (or City to Surf) is a popular road running event held annually in Sydney covering a course. The event is a &quot;fun run&quot; as well as a race, attracting both competitive runners and community participants who can choose to run or to walk. The event attracts more than 80,000 entrants who start in staggered groups based on previous running times and early entry.

==History==
The City2Surf has been held as an annual event since the first run on 5 September 1971, initially as a run that commenced in George Street, adjacent to Sydney Town Hall. It was conceived by the staff of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper and was inspired by the Bay to Breakers event in San Francisco. The first event was jointly organised by the Amateur Athletic Association of NSW and the NSW Women&#x27;s Amateur Athletic Association and attracted 1,576 starters, 1,509 of whom completed the event within the 100 minutes time limit. Many of the entrants were registered athletes belonging to the Registered Athletic Clubs that were part of these two bodies. To date, 24 of those entrants, now known as the City2Surf Legends, have run in every City2Surf.

Since 1973 it has been held on the second Sunday in August, except for the race held in 2000, moved to July due to the Sydney Olympics in August.

When &quot;The Sun&quot; ceased publication in 1988, the sponsorship of the event passed to the new Sunday tabloid &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot;. 

In 2010, on the event&#x27;s 40th anniversary, a record 80,000 participants ran, making it the largest run of its kind in the world. That level of participation has continued.

The course record is 40:03, set by Steve Moneghetti in 1991. The women&#x27;s record is 45:08 minutes, set by Hannah Connor in 2024. Non-Australian athletes typically won the race from 1995 to 2007, including repeat winners Laban Chege (1999–2000), Patrick Nyangelo Lusato (2003–2005), and Dickson Marwa (2006–2007). In 2008, Martin Dent became the first Australian winner since Lee Troop in 1997. Marwa was competing in the 2008 Olympics.

Since 2010 the course has started in several groups to give preference to faster runners. The first group to start are elite wheelchair athletes, followed by invitation-only seeded and preferred runner groups, followed by runners with previous race times under 70 minutes, runners with previous race times under 90 minutes, an open entry running group, an open entry jogging group, and finally an open entry &quot;Back of the Pack&quot; group for walking, using a wheelchair or pushing child strollers. Entry to all groups is limited to a certain number of competitors and, except for the invitation-only groups, allocated on a first-come first-served basis.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020 event, the 50th anniversary, was pushed back from 9 August until 18 October and the live event cancelled for the first time in its history. Instead, the event was run as a virtual event where participants were requested to run the length of the course on local streets using the City2Surf Virtual Run app. In 2021, Sydney had been in another lockdown since June, the physical race was cancelled again and another virtual event scheduled for October.

14 August 2022 saw the return of the live running of the event for the first time since 2019.

==Route==
The route taken by the participants commences in the city centre of Sydney and passes through the suburbs of East Sydney, Kings Cross, Rushcutters Bay, Double Bay, Rose Bay, Vaucluse, Dover Heights and Bondi Beach. The most difficult part of the course is &quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot; at the halfway mark, a steep ascent from Rose Bay to Vaucluse along New South Head Road.

Features en route include many amateur bands performing along the suburban roads, and many City2Surf participants dressed in novelty themed costumes.

==Winners==
== Notable events ==
Deaths during the race have occurred several times. In years 2000, 2008 and 2014, a competitor died of a heart attack close to the finish line of the race. After the 2008 death, medical academic Michael O&#x27;Rourke noted that a runner developing arrhythmia and cardiac arrest happens most years but that the sufferer is usually revived.

The 2016 event was featured in the first season on Ambulance Australia 2018. 300 participants required medical attention, a majority of which needing help after they finished the race.

<doc id="1179342" wikidata="Q107511" url="?curid=1179342" title="San Jose, Occidental Mindoro">
<text>San Jose, officially the Municipality of San Jose (), is a municipality in the province of Occidental Mindoro, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 153,267, representing a third of the provincial population, and is the largest among cities (excluding Puerto Princesa City) and municipalities in the Mimaropa region. It is also the most populous town in Occidental Mindoro.

San Jose has the province&#x27;s largest commercial port and airport, the most banking, business, dining and commercial establishments in Occidental Mindoro, and has become a center of trade in the Mimaropa region. Its major local and international exports include rice, salt and processed milkfish. It was ranked 13th in &quot;overall competitiveness&quot; among Philippine local government units in the 2017 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI).

In pre-colonial times, it was named Pandurucan by the indigenous Mangyans after the local river, before later renamed for its patron saint, St. Joseph, the husband of Mary.

== History ==
Historical records show that in the 14th century, Chinese traders anchored to trade at the shores of Mangarin, the oldest settlement in the southern portion of Occidental Mindoro. Its name was derived from the word “Mandarin”, an official Chinese Palace, the remains of which can still be found in the old barrio of Mangarin. The area was once a Sinified Buddhist state called Ma-i before the Sultanate of Brunei invaded. When the Spanish took possession of the Island in the 18th century, the first site of the Presidencia was built in sitio of Sinaoga, on the western side of Barrio Santa Teresa, now part of the municipality of Magsaysay. A year later, it was again transferred to Caminawit.

Archaeological evidence from caves and rockshelter sites in the island of Ilin indicate human habitation dating back thousands of years (Middle Holocene period, about 6,000 years ago).

=== Early 20th century ===
On May 1, 1910, Pandurucan, which was renamed San Jose, became the seat of the Civil Government with Don German Ramirez as its first appointed leader up to 1915. When the Japanese Imperial Forces occupied the town, Bonifacio Gomez was appointed as Mayor from 1941 to 1942, followed by Pedro Cuden, 1942–1943 and finally Isabelo Abeleda, in 1944 until 1946. During the American reoccupation Bibiano Gaudiel replaced Isabelo Abeleda who regained his position in 1955.

=== World War II ===
San Jose figures prominently in Philippine history for its role during World War II. American naval forces led by General Douglas MacArthur staged a so-called &quot;Second Landing&quot; in the beaches of San Jose (the &quot;First&quot; being the famous Leyte Landing) on December 15, 1944, to retake the Philippine islands from the Japanese (the Battle of Mindoro). Securing San Jose and the whole Mindoro island proved decisive in the goal to recapture Manila and Luzon, and the eventual defeat of the Japanese Imperial forces by Filipino and American troops.

=== Contemporary history ===
In 1950, the Philippine government split Mindoro into two provinces, Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro. San Jose became the temporary capital until it was later transferred to Mamburao. With encouragement from the national government, migration into Mindoro in the years after World War II boosted population growth and spurred development. The Philippine Sugar Mill plantation in the northern Barangay Central helped San Jose become the center of commerce in those years.

On April 3, 1969, the barrios of Alibog, Caguray, Calawag, Gapasan, Laste, Lourdes, Nicolas, Paclolo, Purnaga, Sibalat, and Santa Teresa was separated from San Jose to create a separate municipality known as Magsaysay.

During the 1970s, development has since shifted to what is now the poblacion area and neighboring barangays. The economic base also has widened to include rice, corn, tobacco, salt, and aquaculture production geared towards both the local Philippine and international markets.

=== Conversion into a city ===
The Municipality of San Jose passed Resolution No. 0023 in 2001, seeking conversion to city status. In 2016, Congresswoman Josephine Ramirez-Sato filed House Bill No. 2164 which aims to convert San Jose into a component city. To date, this resolution has not been acted upon or pursued by Congress of the Philippines.

==Geography==

Registered commercial establishments number more than a thousand, and the public market, the center of commercial activities, is the largest in the province of Occidental Mindoro. Major fast food chains and local restaurants serve residents and tourists alike, while retail shopping centers such as San Jose Town Mall offer shopping conveniences. Pharmacies and major banks can also be found in town.

Other industries include hollow blocks making, handicrafts, furniture, sweet goods and other food products (pasalubong), and other small-scale enterprises and home-based businesses. Andrea Benoya&#x27;s Te Ands&#x27; handicrafts are inspired by Mangyan tribe&#x27;s Mindoro&#x27;s culture. Her creations include hand-beaded Pakudos, necklace, cross stitch, fashion accessory, souvenir, key chains, embroidered wallets, apparels, accessories, seashells, coconut shells and handwoven Ramit textile woven on a backstrap loom.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Tom Edwin Adlam (21 October 1893 – 28 May 1975) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The Bedfordshire Regiment during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 27 September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. He later served in the Second World War.

Adlam was twenty two years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on 27 September 1916 at Thiepval, France, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Major-General (later Lieutenant-General, Sir) Ivor Maxse, commanding 18th (Eastern) Division later wrote that Adlam&#x27;s bravery and example and also his skilful handling of his unit was ‘chiefly responsible for the success of the two companies of the Bedfordshire regiment, who cleared and made good the last bit of the Thiepval objective ...It was, in fact, a successful minor operation without which the main attack on Schwaben Redoubt could not take place’.

When interviewed in 1973, Adlam declared: ‘Some officers would think that they had to do better than their own men. But if I found a man who could do something better than me I’d say ‘Well do that’. And I think they like it ... A man likes to be recognised as being a responsible person.’ Simkins would argue that this was an example of initiative being delegated down from division to the man on the spot, as early as the Somme battles.

In civilian life, Adlam was a teacher at Brook Street School in Basingstoke and a member of the National Union of Teachers.

Adlam served in the Second World War with the Royal Engineers (Movement Control Section), and achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at Salisbury Guild Hall.

Adlam&#x27;s voice was used in Peter Jackson&#x27;s World War I film, &quot;They Shall Not Grow Old&quot;.

<doc id="1179347" wikidata="Q234094" url="?curid=1179347" title="Chiaki Kuriyama">
<text>is a Japanese actress, singer, and model. She is best known in the West for her roles as Takako Chigusa in Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Battle Royale&quot; and Gogo Yubari in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;.

==Life and career==
She was born in Tsuchiura, Ibaraki. Kuriyama was a popular model during Japan&#x27;s child model boom in the mid-1990s. In 1997, she appeared in the photobooks &quot;Shinwa-Shōjo&quot; (&quot;Girl of Myth&quot;) and &quot;Shōjokan&quot; (&quot;Girl&#x27;s Residence&quot;), photographed by Kishin Shinoyama. &quot;Shinwa-Shōjo&quot; became a best-seller but, as it contained some nudity, was discontinued by the publisher in 1999 after the institution of new anti–child pornography laws. She also posed as a model for the child fashion magazines &quot;Nicola&quot; (1997–2001) and &quot;Pichi Lemon&quot; (1996–2001).

She had starring roles in the horror films &quot;Shikoku&quot; (1999) and &quot;Ju-on&quot; (2000). Chiaki also appeared in the 2000 action film &quot;Battle Royale&quot; as Takako Chigusa.

Following feature appearances on several Japanese television programs (including &quot;Rokubanme no Sayoko&quot;), Kuriyama made her Hollywood debut in director Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; as Gogo Yubari, the schoolgirl bodyguard of yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Kuriyama&#x27;s other film appearances include major roles in the ninja drama &quot;Azumi 2: Death or Love&quot; and Takashi Miike&#x27;s &quot;Yōkai Daisensō&quot;.

In 2010, she released the CD single &quot;Ryūsei no Namida&quot; on DefStar Records under the artist name &quot;CHiAKi KURiYAMA&quot;. The song was used as the first ending theme for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;. This single was followed by three others under her name as traditionally written in Japanese: &quot;Kanōsei Girl&quot;, &quot;Cold Finger Girl&quot;, and &quot;Oishii Kisetsu&quot; / &quot;Ketteiteki Sanpunkan&quot;; &quot;Kanōsei Girl&quot; was used as the third opening theme for &quot;Yorinuki Gin Tama-san&quot; and &quot;Cold Finger Girl&quot; was used as the opening for the anime adaptation of &quot;Level E&quot;. She followed the singles with an album, &quot;Circus&quot;, in 2011.

<doc id="1179348" wikidata="Q657498" url="?curid=1179348" title="IronPython">
<text>IronPython is an implementation of the Python programming language targeting the .NET and Mono frameworks. The project is currently maintained by a group of volunteers at GitHub. It is free and open-source software, and can be implemented with Python Tools for Visual Studio, which is a free and open-source extension for Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Studio IDE.

IronPython is written entirely in C#, although some of its code is automatically generated by a code generator written in Python.

IronPython is implemented on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), a library running on top of the Common Language Infrastructure that provides dynamic typing and dynamic method dispatch, among other things, for dynamic languages. The DLR is part of the .NET Framework 4.0 and is also a part of Mono since version 2.4 from 2009. The DLR can also be used as a library on older CLI implementations.

== Status and roadmap ==
Jim Hugunin created the project and actively contributed to it up until Version 1.0 which was released on September 5, 2006. IronPython 2.0 was released on December 10, 2008. After version 1.0 it was maintained by a small team at Microsoft until the 2.7 Beta 1 release. Microsoft abandoned IronPython (and its sister project IronRuby) in late 2010, after which Hugunin left to work at Google. The project is currently maintained by a group of volunteers at GitHub.

* Release 2.0, released on December 10, 2008, and updated as 2.0.3 on October 23, 2009, targets CPython 2.5. IronPython 2.0.3 is only compatible up to .NET Framework 3.5.
* Release 2.6, released on December 11, 2009, and updated on April 12, 2010, targets CPython 2.6. IronPython 2.6.1 versions is binary compatible only with .NET Framework 4.0. IronPython 2.6.1 must be compiled from sources to run on .NET Framework 3.5. IronPython 2.6.2, released on October 21, 2010, is binary compatible with both .NET Framework 4.0 and .NET Framework 3.5. 
* Release 2.7 was released on March 12, 2011 and it targets CPython 2.7.
* Release 2.7.1 was released on October 21, 2011 and it targets CPython 2.7.
* Release 2.7.2.1 was released on March 13, 2012. It enables support for ZIP file format libraries, SQLite, and compiled executables.
* Release 2.7.4 was released on September 7, 2013.
* Release 2.7.5 was released on December 6, 2014 and mostly consists of bug fixes.
* Release 2.7.6 was released on August 21, 2016 and only consists of bug fixes.
* Release 2.7.7 was released on December 7, 2016 and only consists of bug fixes.
* Release 2.7.8 was released on February 16, 2018 and consists of bug fixes, reorganized code, and an updated test infrastructure (including significant testing on Linux under Mono). It is also the first release to support .NET Core.
* Release 2.7.9 was released on October 9, 2018 and consists of bug fixes, reorganized code. It is intended to be the last release before IronPython 3.
* Release 2.7.10 was released on April 27, 2020 and adds .NET Core 3.1 support.
* Release 2.7.11 was released on November 17, 2020 and resolves issues when running on .NET 5.
* Release 2.7.12 was released on January 21, 2022 and resolves issues with .NET 6 and removes support for .NET core 2.1
* Release 3.4.0 was released on December 12, 2022 and is the first release to support Python 3.x. 

=== Differences with CPython ===

There are some differences between the Python reference implementation CPython and IronPython. Some projects built on top of IronPython are known not to work under CPython. Conversely, CPython applications that depend on extensions to the language that are implemented in C are not compatible with IronPython
, unless they are implemented in a .NET interop. For example, NumPy was wrapped by Microsoft in 2011, allowing code and libraries dependent on it to be run directly from .NET Framework.

== Silverlight ==
IronPython is supported on Silverlight (which is deprecated by Microsoft and already has lost support in most web browsers). It can be used as a scripting engine in the browser just like the JavaScript engine. IronPython scripts are passed like simple client-side JavaScript scripts in codice_1-tags. It is then also possible to modify embedded XAML markup.

The technology behind this is called Gestalt.
// DLR initialization script.
&lt;script src=&quot;http://gestalt.ironpython.net/dlr-latest.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

// Client-side script passed to IronPython and Silverlight.
&lt;script type=&quot;text/python&quot;&gt;
 window.Alert(&quot;Hello from Python&quot;)
&lt;/script&gt;
The same works for IronRuby.

== License ==
Until version 0.6, IronPython was released under the terms of Common Public License. Following recruitment of the project lead in August 2004, IronPython was made available as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Shared Source initiative. This license is not OSI-approved but the authors claim it meets the open-source definition. With the 2.0 alpha release, the license was changed to the Microsoft Public License, which the OSI has approved. The latest versions are released under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.

== Interface extensibility ==
One of IronPython&#x27;s key advantages is in its function as an extensibility layer to application frameworks written in a .NET language. It is relatively simple to integrate an IronPython interpreter into an existing .NET application framework. Once in place, downstream developers can use scripts written in IronPython that interact with .NET objects in the framework, thereby extending the functionality in the framework&#x27;s interface, without having to change any of the framework&#x27;s code base.

IronPython makes extensive use of reflection. When passed in a reference to a .NET object, it will automatically import the types and methods available to that object. This results in a highly intuitive experience when working with .NET objects from within an IronPython script.

== Examples ==
The following IronPython script manipulates .NET Framework objects. This script can be supplied by a third-party client-side application developer and passed into the server-side framework through an interface. Note that neither the interface, nor the server-side code is modified to support the analytics required by the client application.

from BookService import BookDictionary
booksWrittenByBookerPrizeWinners = [book.Title for book in BookDictionary.GetAllBooks() 
 if &quot;Booker Prize&quot; in book.Author.MajorAwards]

In this case, assume that the .NET Framework implements a class, BookDictionary, in a module called BookService, and publishes an interface into which IronPython scripts can be sent and executed.

This script, when sent to that interface, will iterate over the entire list of books maintained by the framework, and pick out those written by Booker Prize-winning authors.

What&#x27;s interesting is that the responsibility for writing the actual analytics reside with the client-side developer. The demands on the server-side developer are minimal, essentially just providing access to the data maintained by the server. This design pattern greatly simplifies the deployment and maintenance of complex application frameworks.

The following script uses the .NET Framework to create a simple Hello World message.

import clr
clr.AddReference(&quot;System.Windows.Forms&quot;)

from System.Windows.Forms import MessageBox
MessageBox.Show(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
== Performance ==
The performance characteristics of IronPython compared to CPython, the reference implementation of Python, depends on the exact benchmark used. IronPython performs worse than CPython on most benchmarks taken with the PyStone script but better on other benchmarks.
IronPython may perform better in Python programs that use threads or multiple cores, as it has a JIT compiler, and also because it doesn&#x27;t have the Global Interpreter Lock.

== Overview and key features ==

# Integration with .NET: IronPython allows you to use .NET libraries and frameworks directly in your Python code. This means you can leverage the extensive .NET ecosystem and access features that are specific to .NET environments.
# Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR): IronPython runs on the Dynamic Language Runtime, which is a set of services that support dynamic typing and dynamic method invocation in .NET languages.
# Interoperability: You can call .NET code from IronPython and vice versa. This makes it possible to integrate Python scripts with existing .NET applications or use .NET components within Python projects.
# Syntax and Semantics: IronPython aims to be as close as possible to the standard Python language (CPython), though there might be minor differences due to the underlying .NET platform.
# Performance: While IronPython provides good performance for many applications, it might not be as fast as CPython for some tasks, particularly those that rely heavily on Python&#x27;s native libraries.
# Compatibility: IronPython is compatible with Python 2.x, but it does not support Python 3.x features. This means that some newer Python libraries or syntax may not be available.

<text>The RBCC, or rocket-based combined cycle propulsion system, was one of the two types of propulsion systems that may have been tested in the Boeing X-43 experimental aircraft. The RBCC, or strutjet as it is sometimes called, is a combination propulsion system that consists of a ramjet, scramjet, and ducted rocket, where all three systems use a shared flow path.

A TBCC, or turbine-based combined cycle propulsion system, is a turbine engine combined with a ramjet and scramjet.

A TRCC, or turbo rocket combined cycle propulsion system, is another combination propulsion system that combines an afterburning turbine engine with a RBCC propulsion system.

<doc id="1179355" wikidata="Q1164926" url="?curid=1179355" title="Meroitic script">
<text>The Meroitic script consists of two alphasyllabic scripts developed to write the Meroitic language at the beginning of the Meroitic Period (3rd century BC) of the Kingdom of Kush. The two scripts are Meroitic Cursive, derived from Demotic Egyptian, and Meroitic Hieroglyphs, derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Meroitic Cursive is the most widely attested script, constituting ~90% of all inscriptions, and antedates, by a century or more, the earliest surviving Meroitic hieroglyphic inscription. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (ca. 50 BC) described the two scripts in his Bibliotheca historica, Book III (Africa), Chapter 4. The last known Meroitic inscription is the Meroitic Cursive inscription of the Blemmye king, Kharamadoye, from a column in the Temple of Kalabsha (REM 0094), which has recently been re-dated to AD 410/ 450 of the 5th century. Before the Meroitic Period, Egyptian hieroglyphs were used to write Kushite names and lexical items.

Though the Kingdom of Kush ended with the fall of the royal capital of Meroë, use of the language and Cursive script continued for a time after that event. During the 6th century Christianization of Nubia, the Kushite language and Cursive script were replaced by Byzantine Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian. The Old Nubian script, derived from the Uncial Greek script, added three Meroitic Cursive letters: , , and possibly , for Old Nubian [ɲ], [w – u], and [ŋ] respectively. This addition of Meroitic Cursive letters suggests that the development of the Old Nubian script began at least two centuries before its first full attestation in the late 8th century and/or that knowledge of the Kushite language and script was retained until the 8th century.

The script was deciphered in 1909 by Francis Llewellyn Griffith, a British Egyptologist, based on the Meroitic spellings of Egyptian names. However, the Meroitic language itself remains poorly understood. In late 2008, the first complete royal dedication was found, which may help confirm or refute some of the current hypotheses.

The longest inscription found is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

==Form and values==
There were two graphic forms of the Meroitic alphasyllabary: monumental hieroglyphs, and a cursive. The majority of texts are cursive. Unlike Egyptian writing, there was a simple one-to-one correspondence between the two forms of Meroitic, except that in the cursive form, consonants are joined in ligatures to a following vowel i.

The direction of cursive writing was from right to left, top to bottom, while the monumental form was written top to bottom in columns going right to left. Monumental letters were oriented to face the beginning of the text, a feature inherited from their hieroglyphic origin.

Being primarily alphasyllabic, the Meroitic script worked differently than Egyptian hieroglyphs. Some scholars, such as Harald Haarmann, believe that the vowel letters of Meroitic are evidence for an influence of the Greek alphabet in its development.

There were 23 letters in the Meroitic alphasyllabary, including four vowels. In the transcription established by Hintze (based on earlier versions by Griffith), they are:
*a appears only at the beginning of a word
*e was used principally in foreign names
*i and o were used like vowels in the Latin or Greek alphabets.
The fifteen consonants are conventionally transcribed:
*p, b, m, d, t, s, n, r, l, k, q, ḫ, ẖ, w, y
These consonants are understood to have an inherent vowel value /a/, such that p should generally be understood as /pa/.
An additional series of characters is understood to represent consonants with inherent vowels other than /a/:
*ne, se, te, to

These values were established from evidence such as Egyptian names borrowed into Meroitic. That is, the Meroitic letter which looks like an owl in monumental inscriptions, or like a numeral three in cursive Meroitic, we transcribe as m, and it is believed to have been pronounced as [m]. However, this is a historical reconstruction, and while m is not in much doubt, the pronunciations of some of the other letters are much less certain.

The three vowels i a o were presumably pronounced /i a u/. Ḫ is thought to have been a velar fricative, as the &quot;ch&quot; in Scottish &quot;loch&quot; or German &quot;Bach.&quot; H̱ was a similar sound, perhaps uvular as &quot;g&quot; in Dutch &quot;dag&quot; or palatal as in German &quot;ich&quot;. Q was perhaps a uvular stop, as in Arabic &quot;Qatar&quot;. S may have been like &quot;s&quot; in &quot;sun&quot;. An /n/ was omitted in writing when it occurred before any of several other consonants within a word. D is uncertain. Griffith first transcribed it as &quot;r,&quot; and Rowan believes that was closer to its actual value. It corresponds to Egyptian and Greek /d/ when initial or after an /n/ (unwritten in Meroitic), but to /r/ between vowels, and does not seem to have affected the vowel a the way the other alveolar obstruents t n s did.

Comparing late documents with early ones, it is apparent that the sequences &quot;sel-&quot; and &quot;nel-,&quot; which Rowan takes to be /sl/ and /nl/ and which commonly occurred with the determiner &quot;-l-,&quot; assimilated over time to &quot;t&quot; and &quot;l&quot; (perhaps /t/ and /ll/).

The only punctuation mark was a word and phrase divider of two to three dots.

==Principles==
Meroitic was a type of alphabet called an abugida: The vowel /a/ was not normally written; rather it was assumed whenever a consonant was written alone. That is, the single letter m was read /ma/. All other vowels were overtly written: the letters mi, for example, stood for the syllable /mi/, just as in the Latin alphabet. This system is broadly similar to the Indian abugidas that arose around the same time as Meroitic.

===Griffith and Hintze===
Griffith identified the essential abugida nature of Meroitic when he deciphered the script in 1911. He noted in 1916 that certain consonant letters were never followed by a vowel letter, and varied with other consonant letters. He interpreted them as syllabic, with the values &quot;ne, se, te,&quot; and &quot;to.&quot; &quot;Ne,&quot; for example, varied with &quot;na.&quot; &quot;Na&quot; could be followed by the vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;o&quot; to write the syllables &quot;ni&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; but was never followed by the vowel &quot;e.&quot;

He also noted that the vowel &quot;e&quot; was often omitted. It often occurred at the ends of Egyptian loanwords that had no final vowel in Coptic. He believed that &quot;e&quot; functioned both as a schwa and a &quot;killer&quot; mark that marked the absence of a vowel. That is, the letter m by itself was read , while the sequence me was read or . This is how Ethiopic works today. Later scholars such as Hitze and Rilly accepted this argument, or modified it so that &quot;e&quot; could represent either or schwa–zero.

It has long been puzzling to epigraphers why the syllabic principles that underlie the script, where every consonant is assumed to be followed by a vowel &quot;a,&quot; should have special letters for consonants followed by &quot;e.&quot; Such a mixed abugida–syllabary is not found among the abugidas of India, nor in Ethiopic. Old Persian cuneiform script is somewhat similar, with more than one inherent vowel, but is not an abugida because the non-inherent vowels are written with full letters, and are often redundantly written after an inherent vowel other than /a/.

===Millet and Rowan===
Millet (1970) proposed that Meroitic &quot;e&quot; was in fact an epenthetic vowel used to break up Egyptian consonant clusters that could not be pronounced in the Meroitic language, or appeared after final Egyptian consonants such as &quot;m&quot; and &quot;k&quot; which could not occur finally in Meroitic. Rowan (2006) takes this further and proposes that the glyphs &quot;se, ne,&quot; and &quot;te&quot; were not syllabic at all, but stood for consonants , , and at the end of a word or morpheme (as when followed by the determiner &quot;-l;&quot; she proposes Meroitic finals were restricted to alveolar consonants such as these. An example is the Coptic word &quot;prit&quot; &quot;the agent&quot;, which in Meroitic was transliterated &quot;perite (pa-e-ra-i-te).&quot; If Rowan is right and this was pronounced , then Meroitic would have been a fairly typical abugida. She proposes that Meroitic had three vowels, , and that was raised to something like or after the alveolar consonants , explaining the lack of orthographic &quot;t, s, n&quot; followed by the vowel letter &quot;e.&quot;

Very rarely does one find the sequence CVC, where the C&#x27;s are both labials or both velars. This is similar to consonant restrictions found throughout the Afro-Asiatic language family, suggesting to Rowan that there is a good chance Meroitic was an Afro-Asiatic language like Egyptian.

Rowan is not convinced that the system was completely alphabetic, and suggests that the glyph &quot;te&quot; also may have functioned as a determinative for place names, as it frequently occurs at the end of place names that are known not to have a /t/ in them. Similarly, &quot;ne&quot; may have marked royal or divine names.

==Unicode==
Meroitic scripts, both Hieroglyphic and Cursive, were added to the Unicode Standard in January, 2012 with the release of version 6.1.

The Unicode block for Meroitic Hieroglyphs is U+10980–U+1099F.
The Unicode block for Meroitic Cursive is U+109A0–U+109FF.


As a Meroitic Unicode font you may use Aegyptus which can be downloaded from Unicode Fonts for Ancient Scripts.

<text>Agansing Rai (24 April 1920 – 27 May 2000) was a Nepalese Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
He was born in village development Diyale ward No.3 Aapashwara Toll, in the Okhaldhunga district of Nepal.

==Victoria Cross==
Agansing Rai was a 24-year-old Naik in the 2nd Battalion, 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles, in the Indian Army during World War II, when he led his section in an attack on one of two posts which had been taken by the enemy and were threatening the British forces&#x27; communications on 26 June 1944 near the town of Bishenpur in the state of Manipur, India.

Under withering fire Agansing Rai and his party charged a machine-gun. Agansing Rai killed three of the crew. When the first position had been taken, he then led a dash on a machine-gun firing from the jungle, where he killed three of the crew, his men accounting for the rest. He subsequently tackled an isolated bunker single-handed, killing all four occupants. The enemy became so demoralised that they fled and the second post was recaptured.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of Hon. Captain after serving in the Indian Army and died in Kathmandu. Agansing Rai&#x27;s VC group were sold at auction in 2004 and now form part of the Lord Ashcroft VC collection in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Paionios ( &quot;Paiṓnios&quot;) of Mende, Chalkidiki was a Greek sculptor of the late 5th century BC. He most likely received his early training in Northern Greece and is thought to have later adapted Athenian stylistic elements into his own work, based upon his probable interaction with the Olympia workshop of Phidias. In any case, he was &quot;Attic-trained.&quot;

Paionios won the commission to decorate the acroteria of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, as described in the pedestal inscription on his Nike statue. An ancient account also references Paionios&#x27; work at Olympia. Pausanias attributes the front (east) pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Olympian Zeus to Paionios. The Nike Temple parapet at Athens is also often attributed to Paionios, on the basis of similarities between the styles of drapery on both monuments. Despite this assertion, scholars continue to debate the reliability of these attributions based upon the various interpretations of the scant additional evidence.

The Nike of Paionios featured prominently in the design of medals of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, as it did in the design of medals from succeeding Olympiads. The statue likely influenced later artistic renderings of victory personified. It is on permanent exhibition at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia.

==Nike of Paionios==

The only work that can be positively attributed to him is the statue of Nike () discovered at Olympia. The Nike of Paeonios adorned a three-sided triangular pillar roughly 30 feet tall. She stood in the Altis of the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. With her wings and head intact, the statue itself was about 3 meters tall. Her drapery would have been painted red. The German School began excavations at Olympia in 1875; the French School had done excavations earlier in the nineteenth century.

The Nike of Paeonius was erected ; a few years after the Athenian allies defeated the Spartans at the Battle of Sphacteria in 425 BC. The inscription reads that it was &quot;dedicated by the Messenians and Naupaktians as a tithe of the spoils of their enemies.

The Messenians and Naupaktians, allies of the Athenians, are careful not to mention &quot;their enemies,&quot; the Spartans, by name. Pausanias, a travel writer in the 2nd century AD, wrote, &quot;But the Messenians themselves say that the offering is a trophy of the battle in which they fought on the Athenian side in the island of Sphacteria and that they refrained from inscribing the name of the enemy for fear of the Lacedaemonians (Spartans).&quot; The placement of this dedicatory statue at Olympia, considered Spartan ground, is most often interpreted by scholars as a deliberate and assertive act of dominance.

This sculpture may be understood as political propaganda within the context of the Messenian Wars. At least a century earlier, the Spartans had erected a statue of Zeus in the sanctuary, commemorating a victory over the Messenians. This dedication is also mentioned by Pausanias. The positioning of the Nike may be seen as a visual response: the Nike erected by the Messenians and Naupaktians would appear to the visitor in front of the hand of the Zeus dedication behind it.

Paeonios combined both Ionian and Doric traditions in this monument. The erection of an offering on a high pillar is of Ionian origin, as the Dorians tended to use lower bases. By placing a well-known, generic image of triumph upon a pillar to symbolize a specific Victory, Paionios added to this tradition. The Ionians also favored marble more often, yet the Nike wears a Dorian peplos.

Paeonios slips his own victory into the inscription on his Nike monument. It reads that he was the &quot;successful competitor in the construction of the akroteria for the temple.&quot; His victory in the competition was likely the result of devising not only the most aesthetically pleasing option but also the most financially feasible. That this piece of artwork is inscribed with the fund, occasion, and the artist makes it invaluable for creating a history of Greek artistic and dedicatory work.

<doc id="1179365" wikidata="Q525684" url="?curid=1179365" title="Ford Puma (coupé)">
<text>The Ford Puma is a small car that was produced by Ford Europe from September 1997 to July 2002. The Puma is a three-door coupé that is based on the Mark IV Ford Fiesta and was built at Ford&#x27;s Niehl plant in Cologne, Germany. The Puma follows common design cues with other Ford cars at the time, and is in the New Edge family of vehicles.

== Concept ==
The Ford Puma program was initiated in 1993 when then–Ford CEO and President Jac Nasser and Ford Small and Medium Vehicle design director Claude Lobo discussed the possibility of doing a 2+2 coupe based on Fiesta chassis. All development was done using Paintbox CAD system which allowed designers to render a 2D and 3D models.

The first iteration of the design, called the Lynx concept car, was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 1996, and production car was launched in 1997 Geneva Motor show.

== Technical details ==
All Pumas are front-engined, front-wheel-drive, three-door coupés with four seats. They came with alloy wheels as standard, (although the Ford Racing Puma was equipped with alloy wheels), with front disc and rear drum brakes. However, the Ford Racing Puma was fitted with front and rear disc brakes. 
The car was based on the Mark 4 Ford Fiesta, with new engines (codeveloped with Yamaha), a new body, stiffer suspension, wider track and close-ratio gearbox, among other changes.

The Puma was available with four engine options: 1.4-litre (1997-2000), 1.6-litre (2000-2001), 1.7-litre VCT (only used in the Puma), and the Tickford-tuned 1.7-litre VCT (which was only used in the Ford Racing Puma), each of which used Ford&#x27;s 16-v Sigma engines branded as Zetec-SE. Additionally, the 1.7-litre engines used Nikasil cylinder plating, which required a specific grade of oil (5W30 semisynthetic) to minimise mechanical wear.

The production journey of the 1.7-litre VCT was quite interesting. Rough machined cylinder blocks were shipped from Ford&#x27;s Valencia plant in Spain to Yamaha in Japan for Nikasil coating and completion. These were then shipped back to Ford&#x27;s Cologne plant where the Puma was assembled.

All 1.7-litre-engined Pumas were equipped with low-speed traction control and antilock brakes. The antilock braking system was optional in the 1.4-litre Puma.

During the relatively short production run, approximately 133,000 Pumas were built (all models including the Ford Racing Puma). At its peak, 52,950 were registered with the DVLA in the UK, which has since reduced to 7,493 (including 5,457 that have statutory off-road notification (SORN)) as of Q3 2023.

=== Engines ===
== Special edition variants in United Kingdom markets ==

Quantity produced: 500 (all numbered on inlet manifold)

The Ford Racing Puma was the name eventually given to Ford&#x27;s concept Puma, the Puma ST160 Concept, which was first unveiled to the public at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. At the time, Ford were keen to stress that this was no mere styling job and the idea was to transfer the know-how and technology learned directly from Ford Puma race and rally programmes to a road car. It was created by the Ford Rally specialist team at Boreham. The strictly limited production run was initially pencilled to run for 1000 units, with 500 destined for the German market, and 500 for the UK. All conversions were carried out by Tickford, Daventry UK. In the end, only the 500 destined for the UK market were produced and sold.

Less than half of the 500 cars were actually sold directly to customers, with the vehicle&#x27;s high price (£23,000 when new) often cited as a reason, as rival performance cars such as the Subaru Impreza (with an additional 50+ BHP/Turbo, four-wheel-drive and rallying pedigree) were being offered for a maximum of £21,000 with the optional Pro Drive pack. The lower than anticipated demand had Ford offering Racing Pumas to senior managers through their MRC scheme, which enabled cars to continue being registered and converted. The lack of demand when brand new has allowed it to maintain an increased value over the standard Puma due to its rarity.

==== Race braking system ====
For the Racing Puma, Ford partnered with Alcon Design to produce a 4-Piston Motorsport braking system. The Alcon Racing Front Brake calipers use x 28mm discs (253mm discs on the rear). These brakes are one of the defining attributes of the Racing Puma and they contribute significantly to enabling the standard car to pull a substantial 1.1g+ of braking force in the dry. This compares well to the normal Puma&#x27;s ability to achieve 0.7g on regular, smaller, x brake discs and calipers.

The brake calipers themselves, being derived from a racing set-up, do not come fitted with any protective rubber boots which prevent brake dust and debris from coming into contact with the brake pistons. This means the brakes should be serviced regularly (fully dismantled and properly cleaned) to maintain efficiency. Furthermore, the inner portions of the caliper were unpainted aluminium, and are susceptible to corrosion.

==== Bodywork and handling ====
The bodywork was beefed up with wider, lightweight aluminium front and steel rear overhangs; these covered a substantially widened track at both the front and rear, requiring longer drive shafts unique to the Racing Puma. A front aerodynamic air splitter and modified wider front bumper with sports grill were used. The wheels are MiM Speedline alloys, 17 x 7.5 in (with an ET28 Offset) and use 215/40 17 tyres (original fitment tyres were Michelin SXGT 215/40 R17), this increases the width from 1674 mm to 1770 mm. The S1600 rally Puma is just 35 mm wider than this.

The Racing Puma&#x27;s suspension was developed and honed by Ford&#x27;s specialist division at Boreham, Essex, and the cars&#x27; monocoque shell was originally designed to be Ford&#x27;s WRC entrant. Stig Blomqvist spent months fine-tuning the car&#x27;s handling to ensure its chassis dynamics were perfected. The wider track, uprated springs, dampers, and special geometry settings refined the car&#x27;s cornering poise to another level beyond the standard car&#x27;s already excellent handling. The upshot of the improved chassis finesse was a bias towards tracks, hence the car has a very firm ride.

All Racing Pumas left the factory painted metallic Imperial Blue to signify their special racing edition status. This colour was only used by Ford on a select range of cars such as the Ford Escort Cosworth and Mk.1 Ford Focus RS edition models. The colour was not available on the regular Pumas in the UK market.

==== Gearbox and optional limited-slip differential ====
The standard IB5 gearbox was strengthened on the Racing Puma in comparison to the standard models. It contains modified shafts, which have been shot peened to withstand the extra load placed upon them. This allowed a revised Power-train Control Module software to be used, allowing more power and torque to be used in lower gears.

Additionally, Ford Racing offered an optional limited-slip differential to enhance handling even further, only 75 customer cars actually came equipped with that option from factory, but since then, subsequent owners have been known to retrofit it.

==== Racing-inspired interior ====
Sparco were commissioned to provide high-grip bucket seats for improved driver control in cornering situations. The blue Alcantara trim used on the seats and steering wheel provided improved grip over other material types. The door cards, rear seats, and rear interior were also trimmed with the same material, and the front seats were embroidered with the Ford Racing emblem.

==== FRP engine ====
The original design remit was to achieve 180 bhp using a 1.7-litre Zetec SE equipped with a turbocharger. However, due to spiralling project costs, this was not achieved and eventually the Racing Puma engineers were forced to keep their changes within a naturally aspirated engine. The majority of the engine remained unchanged from the 1.7 Zetec SE used in the standard Puma. Only the camshafts, air intake (with the unique edition number engraved on it), a specially tuned complete exhaust system by Janspeed, and a revised engine management software helped to increase power by 30 hp, reducing the 0- time to 7.8 seconds, achieving a 126 mph (203 km/h) top speed.

== Rallying ==

Ford produced a Ford Puma kit car, which was designed specifically for rallying. The Puma&#x27;s technical details included a Zetec SE all-alloy engine with four cylinders and 16 valves at 1596 cm3, power over at 9000 rpm, front wheel drive via a Hewland six-speed sequential gearbox, limited slip differential, dynamic front suspension using MacPherson struts with adjustable spring platforms, Ford Racing rear trailing arm beam with adjustable dynamic suspension, Alcon front brakes with diameter ventilated discs using four-piston calipers, Alcon diameter solid disc rear brakes with two piston calipers, a welded steel safety roll cage, and front and rear wheel arches and bumpers in composite.

The fuel tank was a 55-litre capacity FIA &#x27;bag&#x27; tank located beneath the rear floor. Wheels were Tarmac 7 x 17 in aluminium wheels or 6 x 15 in aluminium wheels for gravel.

== Style and advertising ==

Stylistically, the Puma followed Ford&#x27;s New Edge design strategy, as first seen in the 1996 Ford Ka. While not as controversial as the Ka when it first appeared, the Puma did achieve critical acclaim for its well-proportioned and cat-like design cues.

The Puma was memorable for its pan-European launch campaign that featured Steve McQueen. The original United Kingdom television advertisement used clips from the movie &quot;Bullitt&quot; and cut McQueen into the modern setting of a Puma in San Francisco. In Q4 2004, Ford once again used the McQueen footage for the first 2005 Ford Mustang commercial in the United States. Both commercials were directed by British director Paul Street, and won many advertising industry awards, featuring in all-time top 10 ad charts.

== Discontinuation ==
The Puma was only sold in Europe. Production ended in 2001, although sale of stock vehicles continued into 2002. Ford did not replace it with another small coupé, and instead introduced the Ford StreetKa, a two-seater convertible based on the Fiesta like the Puma was. The StreetKa also borrowed the Puma&#x27;s transmission and suspension. There are 7,493 Ford Pumas (including cars declared as SORN) that remain registered with the DVLA in the UK as of Q3 2023. However, the name was revived by Ford as a crossover model in 2019.

<text>François Louis Thomas Francia (1772–1839) was a French watercolour painter born in Calais and famous for his shore landscapes. He spent much of the earlier part of his life in England. The British painter Richard Parkes Bonington was his pupil.

==Life==
Francia was born at Calais on 21 December 1772, and was taken early in life to London by his father, a refugee. 
He was for some time employed as an assistant of a drawing-master named Barrow, who was the master of John Varley. He showed a total of 85 works at the Royal Academy between 1795 and 1821 (inclusive).
He was one of the sketching society formed by Thomas Girtin about 1799, and there is drawing of a moonlit landscape in the Victoria and Albert Museum dated in May of that year.

He was a member of the (now Royal) Society of Painters in Water-Colours, and for some time its secretary, but he resigned his membership, and became in 1816 an unsuccessful candidate for the associateship of the Royal Academy. 
The next year he retired to Calais, where he lived until his death on 6 February 1839. It was here that he gave lessons to Richard Parkes Bonington, whose coast scenes bear much resemblance to the later works of Francia. 

Francia&#x27;s earlier drawings are broad and simple in execution, rich, but sombre in colour, like those of Girtin; but his later work, while still retaining its breadth and harmony, is brighter and lighter in tone, and more subtle in handling. 
Though he painted landscape of different kinds, his favourite subjects were shore scenes, which he executed with great truth and beauty of aerial effect. He was an excellent draughtsman of boats and shipping, and some of his drawings were engraved to illustrate a book of sketches of shipping by Edward William Cooke. 
He was one of the earliest and most accomplished of English watercolourists, and his works are distinguished by their fine colour and poetical feeling. There are several of his drawings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and a few at the British Museum. In 1810, he published &quot;Studies of Landscapes by T. Gainsborough, J. Hoppner, R.A., T. Girtin, &amp;c., imitated from the originals by L. F.&quot;

<doc id="1179369" wikidata="Q780451" url="?curid=1179369" title="Dome car">
<text>A dome car is a type of railway passenger car that has a glass dome on the top of the car where passengers can ride and see in all directions around the train. It also can include features of a coach, lounge car, dining car, sleeping car or observation. Beginning in 1945, dome cars were primarily used in the United States and Canada, though a small number were constructed in Europe for Trans Europ Express service.

In North America, dome cars were manufactured by the Budd Company, Pullman Standard and American Car &amp; Foundry. Southern Pacific Railroad built its own dome cars in its Sacramento, California, shops. In the 1990s Colorado Railcar began producing dome cars. Generally, seats in the dome were considered &quot;non-revenue&quot; like lounge car seats.

==Configuration==

A portion of the car, usually in the center of the car but offset towards one end, is split between two levels. The offset results in floorplans having a &quot;long end&quot; and a &quot;short end&quot; on the main level. Stairs then go up to the dome and down to the lower level, with the lower level below the dome usually offering restrooms or a small lounge area, while the upper portion is usually coach or lounge seating within a &quot;bubble&quot; of glass on the car&#x27;s roof. Passengers in the upper portion of the dome are able to see in all directions from a vantage point above the train&#x27;s roofline.

In the United States, the Union Pacific Railroad operated dome dining cars. These cars had a kitchen in the short end, with a pantry in half the space under the dome. The other half of the space under the dome was a private dining room for small groups. Between the pantry and kitchen there was a dumbwaiter to transfer items between the kitchen and the dining area in the dome portion of the car. The &quot;long end&quot; was the main dining area.

The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad operated mid-train dome-dormitory-buffet-lounge cars on its California Zephyr, Kansas City Zephyr and American Royal Zephyr, and dome-dormitory-coffee shop cars on its Denver Zephyr. The dormitory space was used by on-board train crew such as the dining car staff.

Several railroads operated dome sleeping cars. Those of the Northern Pacific Railway had four bedrooms in the &quot;long end&quot;, four roomettes in the &quot;short end&quot; and four duplex single rooms under the dome.

The Wabash Railroad and Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad operated dome parlor cars for first class day service. Wabash&#x27;s Blue Bird included a Budd dome-parlor-observation as part of its original consist, and later added a Pullman-Standard dome-parlor car. The CB&amp;Q operated dome-parlor-observation cars on the Twin Zephyrs, the Kansas City Zephyr and the Denver Zephyr.

Several railroads operated dome observation cars, usually at the rear of the train. These cars have a dome on top of the car with a rounded-end or flat-end rear &quot;observation&quot; section (on the main floor) where passengers can sit and look out at the receding scenery. These cars often have additional sleeping compartments under the dome and/or in the &quot;short end&quot; as well as a bar and/or additional lounge spaces.

The original &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, operated in part by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q), referred to its car of this type as a Vista-Dome sleeper-lounge-observation, which had one drawing room and three double bedrooms as well as a dome and observation area. The Canadian Pacific Railway outfitted the 1955 &quot;Canadian&quot; with &quot;Park&quot;-series dome-sleeper-observations, most of which remain in service with Via Rail Canada.
===Variations===
While the partial dome cars were the most common, a number of variations on the dome car (typically called &quot;observation&quot; cars) were developed. In particular the full length dome car, the dome lounge car, as well as the &quot;transition&quot; car stand out. In the case of the former, the observation dome extended the full length of the car, with a lower level which contained a lounge or bar beneath it. This type of car was used extensively by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) railroads.

In 1956, the Santa Fe introduced Hi-Level cars on its El Capitan chair car train. These were built like dome cars, with high floors along their length and a low section between their bogie trucks. The lower level contained low entrance doors and restrooms on chair cars, kitchens on diners, and a wet bar on the &quot;Top of the Cap&quot; lounge cars (which were the only cars of the group that could be called dome cars). Most vestibules were on the upper level. Transition cars were similar to full length chair cars, save in one regard. These cars were intended to serve as a transition between regular rolling stock, and double deck stock. To facilitate this, one vestibule of the car was lower, while the other was at the height of the upper vestibule of the double deck stock. Amtrak utilized these cars for a time, primarily in situations where cars inherited from other railroads made up the bulk of Amtrak&#x27;s rolling stock. All these El Capitan cars were used heavily in the early days of Amtrak, and served as a pattern when Amtrak began to purchase, or produce, its own double deck cars. The majority of transition cars were scrapped, though a few were kept in service and rebuilt into more &quot;traditional&quot; high-vestibule double-deck cars.

==Dome lounge==

A dome lounge is a type of domed railroad passenger car that includes lounge, cafe, dining or other space on the upper level or both levels of the car. Examples include both short (approximately half the length of the car, with the dome located just forward or just rearward of the car&#x27;s center) and full (taking almost the entire length of the car). Some examples include sleeping compartments or coach seating.

Classic dome lounges (built during the streamliner era in the U.S. and Canada) include:
&quot;Super Dome&quot; full-length cars were built by Pullman-Standard in 1952 for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific, also known as the Milwaukee Road, and operated in the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot; passenger train fleet. Ten cars were initially constructed, with one of these destroyed in a derailment while on a test run and later rebuilt using new parts and parts salvaged from the original destroyed car.

&quot;Big Dome&quot; full-length cars built by the Budd Company in 1954 for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe for the railroad&#x27;s passenger train fleet. Fourteen of these were built in two groups, one group of which included crew dormitory space on the lower level.

&quot;Great Dome&quot; full-length cars built by the Budd Company in 1956 for the Great Northern Railway for its &quot;Empire Builder&quot; train. Six of these were built; one of them was actually owned by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, over which the train operated between Chicago and the Twin Cities. One former Great Northern car number 1391, &quot;Ocean View&quot;, remains in Amtrak ownership.

&quot;Pleasure Dome&quot; short dome cars built by Pullman-Standard in 1950 for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe for its &quot;Super Chief&quot; train. The six cars had both lounge and dining facilities, including the unique &quot;Turquoise Room&quot;, a small dining area identified by the turquoise Native American medallion displayed on one of the room&#x27;s walls.

&quot;Vista Dome&quot; short dome cars built by the Budd Company for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy for its Zephyr passenger trains. Examples included two dome-parlor-observations built in 1947 for the &quot;Twin Zephyrs&quot;; six dome-buffet-lounges and six dome-sleeper-observations built in 1949 for the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;; two dome-coach-buffet-lounges and two dome-parlor-observations built in 1953 for the &quot;Kansas City Zephyr&quot;; and two dome-buffet-lounges and two dome-parlor-observations built in 1956 for the &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;. The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; cars included those built for the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western and the Western Pacific, which were partners with the CB&amp;Q on the train&#x27;s route between Chicago and the San Francisco Bay area.

&quot;Vista Dome&quot; short dome cars built for the Wabash Railroad. The Budd Company built a dome-parlor-observation in 1950 for the railroad&#x27;s &quot;Blue Bird&quot;; Pullman-Standard built a dome-parlor for the same train in 1952.
&quot;Astra Dome&quot; short dome cars built by American Car &amp; Foundry in 1955 for the Union Pacific Railroad and operated on the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;City of Portland&quot; and other UP passenger trains. The railroad purchased 15 dome-lounge-observations.

&quot;Skyline&quot; dome-coach-buffet-lounges and &quot;Park&quot; dome-sleeper-observations built by the Budd Company in 1955 for the Canadian Pacific Railway. The CPR purchased 18 of each car type for its &quot;Canadian&quot; and &quot;Dominion&quot; passenger trains.

&quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot; cars constructed by the Southern Pacific Railroad for its &quot;Daylight&quot; passenger trains. The railroad built seven cars in its own shops, using components from retired cars and dome components supplied by the Budd Company. These cars were more accurately three-quarter-length domes, since the dome level was more than half the length of the car but did not extend the full length.

===Waning years of original passenger train use===
Most of these cars remained in service for their original owners up to the end of privately run passenger trains in North America in the 1970s. In the U.S., most cars moved on to Amtrak or to operators such as Auto Train. A few remained in business car service for their original railroads. In Canada, the entire Canadian Pacific fleet went to Via Rail.

==History==
Although the design of a dome car can be likened to a cupola caboose, the dome car&#x27;s development is not directly related. The earliest documented predecessor of the dome car was first developed in the 1880s; known at the time as the &quot;birdcage car&quot;, it was used on an 1882 sightseeing tour on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1891, T. J. McBride received a patent for a car design called an &quot;observation-sleeper&quot;; illustrations of the design in &quot;Scientific American&quot; at the time showed a car with three observation domes. Canadian Pacific Railway used &quot;tourist cars&quot; with raised, glass-sided viewing cupolas on their trains through the Canadian Rocky Mountains in the 1920s.

These dome car designs did not prove successful, and further refinements to the idea didn&#x27;t come for a few decades. The first successful dome cars were conceived by Cyrus Osborn of General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). In 1944, while traveling in an EMD-built Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western locomotive through Glenwood Canyon in Colorado, he recognized the wonderful views the passengers could enjoy from a panoramic dome. His idea was to provide a full 360-degree view from above the train in newly built &quot;Vista-Dome&quot; cars.

Mr. Osborn took the idea to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q). The CB&amp;Q took a stainless steel Budd-built coach and rebuilt it at their shops in Aurora, Illinois, with the Vista Dome imagined and sketched by Cyrus Osborn. The dome area featured seats that were positioned lengthwise in the cabin facing double-pane windows which were designed to improve insulation. This first Vista Dome was called, appropriately, &quot;Silver Dome&quot;. On July 23, 1945, the car was tested in the consist of the &quot;Twin Cities Zephyr&quot;. Vista Domes quickly found their way into many Burlington &quot;Zephyr&quot; consists, culminating in 1949 with the inauguration of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;.

Soon after &quot;Silver Dome&quot; entered service, railroad managers and passenger train executives met to discuss the merits of the dome car design. In the United States, domes could only be readily used on railroads west of the Mississippi, due to lower clearances in tunnels in the eastern USA. (In Canada, Canadian Pacific would run its domes from coast to coast.) The managers also noted that the passenger carrying space was regarded as non-revenue space because the managers believed that passengers would not want to spend their entire trip in the domes. These factors and the added costs of car construction in adding stairs, two levels of car floors and air conditioning increased the costs to railroads that chose to operate dome cars.

Despite the costs involved, Pullman completed the first four production dome cars for GM&#x27;s &quot;Train of Tomorrow&quot; in 1947. The four cars, dubbed Astra Liners, included a coach, diner, sleeper and lounge-observation., were similar to &quot;Silver Dome&quot; and were displayed to the press on numerous private charters and to the public at the Chicago Railroad Fairs in 1948 and 1949 before they were sold to Union Pacific Railroad for use between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. Other passenger car manufacturers soon built their own dome car models to compete with Pullman; Budd&#x27;s first domes, completed in Fall 1947, were the first to feature curved glass and full streamlining effects on the domes and entered service on the Burlington&#x27;s &quot;Twin Zephyrs&quot; between Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was the first to operate dome cars east of Chicago in 1948 on their Pere Marquette District routes between Western Michigan and Chicago, and in 1949 Baltimore and Ohio Railroad became the first railroad to operate dome cars on the east coast when it introduced Pullman-built &quot;Strata-Dome&quot; coaches as part of the new consists for the Baltimore-Chicago &quot;Columbian&quot;. B&amp;O also went so far as to add floodlights on the roofs of its dome cars to illuminate the scenery during nighttime travel.

On September 14, 1950, a monument was established at Glenwood Canyon. Called &quot;Monument to an Idea&quot;, this monument celebrated the Vista Dome at the place where it was first inspired. In the late 1980s, the monument was moved to the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado, to make way for expansion of Interstate 70.

The first ten full-length domes were built by Pullman for the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Chicago-Seattle &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot;. The Milwaukee Road paid $320,000 each for their &quot;Super Domes&quot; and used them on that route until 1961, after which four cars remained in service between Chicago and the Twin Cities; these last four were sold to Amtrak upon its formation in 1971. Like most Pullman domes the Milwaukee domes were tall rather than the Budd/ACF standard . The Santa Fe and Great Northern also bought full-length domes from Budd in 1954 and 1955. All but one of Santa Fe&#x27;s cars were sold to Auto-Train in 1971.

As railroad passenger ridership declined in the late 1950s, some railroads retired dome cars due to the maintenance costs. Other railroads that had not purchased dome cars new bought them second-hand. Illinois Central purchased several cars from Missouri Pacific and Canadian National bought several cars from Milwaukee Road, for example. Because of their enormous usage of sealed glass, the cooling of the cars required massive air-conditioning capacity. Maintenance and repair of these cars was costly. Breakdown of the air-conditioning system on the road, even in winter, could render a car unusable.

Since the 1980s, dome cars have become rare since Amtrak introduced Superliner bi-level passenger cars that are tall over the length of the car. Dome cars are very popular on tourist railways and private charter rail services. Some railroad museums have preserved several dome cars. These cars are very popular with visitors who often remember the spectacular rides they had in these cars.

While the dome car is a mostly North American feature, a few also operated in the scenic areas of Europe. The German Federal Railways had five low-profile dome cars built in the early-to-mid 1960s for its &quot;Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Rheinpfeil&quot; trains. From June 1973 to May 1976, the Trans-Europe Express train &quot;Erasmus&quot; also carried dome cars. After being retired from regular service, these cars have been operated in excursion and charter service throughout Europe.

==Current usage==
Most dome lounges survive as of 2023. Some are in excursion train or dinner train service, while others are on display in museums. A few remain in business car service. Most of the original Canadian Pacific cars remain in service on the transcontinental Canadian train operated by Via Rail Canada.
===Canada===
Via Rail Canada operates the largest fleet (28) of true dome cars in the classic sense in that they offer a 360° view of the scenery. All were built by Budd for the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1954-1955 and transferred to Via service in 1978, where they continue in service.

The Ontario Northland Railway operates dome cars on the Polar Bear Express from Cochrane to Moosonee.

The Canadian National Railway operates a former Great Northern dome coach in its business car fleet.

In 2018, Canadian Pacific acquired ex-Southern Pacific dome car #3605. It was rebuilt and repainted into Canadian Pacific&#x27;s Tuscan red and gold livery, and renamed &#x27;Selkirk&#x27; while retaining its road number. The car is now being used on the business train as well as the Royal Canadian Pacific excursion train.

The Orford Express dinner/excursion train, which operates out of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, includes a former Northern Pacific dome sleeper.

===India===
Indian Railways (IR) is currently using 41 Vistadome coaches in different railway zones of the country. IR planned to introduce 49 more Vistadome coaches by the end of 2021 to meet the growing demand of tourists.

===Panama===
The Panama Canal Railway operates a 1950s-vintage dome car originally built by Southern Pacific on its route between Panama City and Colón alongside the Panama Canal.

===United States===
Manufacturing companies such as Colorado Railcar have built modern dome cars with updated versions of original dome design, used by American Orient Express, Holland America, Princess Tours, Alaska Railroad, Royal Caribbean, Via Rail Canada and Rocky Mountaineer Railtours. Several of the private railroad cars available for charter listed on the American Association of Private Railroad Car Owners&#x27; website have domes.

A new generation of dome lounges currently operate in cruise train service in Alaska and Canada. These do not necessarily use the traditional dome design, but are more similar to the bi-level design first seen in commuter-style &quot;gallery&quot; cars on U.S. railroads in the 1950s and on the &quot;Hi-Level&quot; cars built by the Budd Company in 1956 for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe &quot;El Capitan&quot; train.

Most of these cars were constructed by Colorado Railcar Company of Fort Lupton, Colorado. Some early versions were built by Tillamook Railcar of Tillamook, Oregon, which operated out of an old U.S. Navy airship hangar at the Tillamook Airport. The owner of Tillamook Railcar later went on to form Colorado Railcar. These early versions were reconstructed from retired commuter &quot;gallery&quot; cars. More recent ones were built new, and several of these are longer and taller than the classic passenger car design.

Amtrak operated one dome car, #10031. It is a Budd full-length dome car, former Great Northern Railway #1391 &quot;Ocean View&quot; up until 2019. Painted in Phase III paint, it is used on special services such as the Oakland to Reno &quot;Reno Fun Train&quot;, or the Seattle to Leavenworth &quot;Snow Train&quot;. Amtrak has also operated the car in fall foliage service on the New York-Montreal &quot;Adirondack&quot; and on several of its Chicago-based regional trains. In the summertime, dome car #10031 is used on the single level Pacific Surfliner trainset. Another dome car Amtrak used (no longer in service) was on the Capitol Limited, possibly removed when the train switched to Superliner I &amp; II cars. The Ocean View dome car has since been sold to Paxrail.

In addition, the following railroads and tourist railways operate one or more domes:
* &quot;Silver Dome&quot; is on display at the Mad River and NKP Railroad Museum in Bellevue, Ohio.
* The Grand Canyon Railway operates dome coaches between Williams, Arizona and the south rim of the Grand Canyon. These are former Great Northern, Northern Pacific and Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western cars. It also has a former Great Northern full-length dome lounge from the former American Orient Express fleet.
* The Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California, rosters several Budd-built Vista-Dome cars from the original &quot;California Zephyr&quot; train. These are being restored as part of the museum&#x27;s Zephyr Project, a program to re-create the CZ experience.
* The Napa Valley Wine Train operates a 1952-vintage Pullman-Standard Super Dome lounge originally built for the Milwaukee Road, which it uses as one of its dining areas on its daily service.
* The Alaska Railroad operates older, traditional dome cars on several trains, in addition to the newer custom-built Ultra Dome cars found on its Denali Star train between Anchorage and Fairbanks.
* The Union Pacific Railroad operates several traditional dome cars as part of its business and excursion car fleet. These cars include dome coaches, dome dining cars and dome lounges, and all were once part of the railroad&#x27;s famed &quot;City&quot; fleet of passenger trains. These cars often appear in special trains pulled by the railroad&#x27;s two historic preserved steam locomotives, 4-8-4 &quot;Northern&quot; #844 and 4-8-8-4 &quot;Big Boy&quot; #4014.
* The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) has two dome lounge cars, a former Santa Fe car &quot;Bay View&quot; and a former Great Northern car, &quot;Glacier View&quot; in its business car fleet. Bay View often appears on the employee appreciation excursions which operate on each BNSF operating division every few years while Glacier View is used as a lounge on business and officers&#x27; specials. Glacier View was rebuilt with a large observation window on the rear much like the lounge car &quot;William Barstow Strong&quot;. 
* The Royal Gorge Route Railroad and the Rio Grande Scenic Railroad operate former Santa Fe, Great Northern and Milwaukee Road full-length domes in excursion service on their respective routes in central and southern Colorado. A unique feature of the Rio Grande Scenic service is the chance to ride in a modern dome car behind a vintage steam locomotive.
* The Mount Hood Railroad operates a former Santa Fe full-length dome lounge on its excursion trains out of Hood River, Ore.
* The Kansas City Southern Railway operates two former Union Pacific domes, a coach and a dining car, in its business car fleet. 
* The Branson Scenic Railroad in Missouri owns several former CB&amp;Q domes and operates a dome car on all excursions. 
* The Conway Scenic Railroad in New Hampshire operates a former Great Northern Railway dome coach on the Crawford Notch train.
* The Cafe Lafayette Dinner Train in New Hampshire includes a former Missouri Pacific dome coach.
* The Delaware &amp; Ulster Railroad operates a former Missouri Pacific dome coach on its &quot;Rip Van Winkle Flyer&quot; dinner train in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains.
* The Reading, Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates two former Milwaukee Road Super Dome lounges and a former Santa Fe (ex-SLRG) Super Dome car in its business car/excursion fleet.
* The Arkansas &amp; Missouri Railroad operates a former Western Pacific Budd dome coach in excursion service. This car was originally built for the California Zephyr and later used on the original Auto Train, as part of the Pacific Starlight Dinner Train on BC Rail, and for the Ontario Northland Railway.
* The Saratoga &amp; North Creek Railway operates several ex-Santa Fe Budd dome lounges in passenger service between Saratoga Springs and North Creek, N.Y.
* The Santa Cruz &amp; Monterey Bay Railroad operated a former Santa Fe Budd dome lounge on its 2012 &quot;Train To Christmas Town&quot; excursions between Watsonville and Santa Cruz, Calif., and ran a former Union Pacific dome diner on its 2013 trips. The dome diner, as well as a former Milwaukee Road dome lounge and a former Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe dome lounge, are part of the former Spirit of Washington Dinner Train consist that was acquired by the railroad&#x27;s parent company.
* Iowa Pacific Holdings is the parent company for the Saratoga &amp; North Creek and the Santa Cruz &amp; Monterey Bay, as well as the Mount Hood Railroad and the Rio Grande Scenic Railroad, two other dome operators listed here.
* Iowa Pacific also operates Pullman Rail Journeys on the Amtrak &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; route between Chicago and New Orleans. This consist includes a former Santa Fe Budd dome lounge configured for dining service, and the company also has a former Northern Pacific dome-sleeper available for this service.
* Pan Am Railways operates a former Wabash dome coach on its business car train.
* The Heart of Dixie Railroad Museum operates a Missouri Pacific Railroad Planetarium Dome coach on its Calera &amp; Shelby Railroad. The coach was built as MP 892 in 1948, renumbered to MP 592 in 1968. After being purchased by the Illinois Central, it was renumbered 2202. The museum purchased the car for steam excursion service in 1972 keeping the 2202 but replacing Illinois Central on the letter boards with Heart of Dixie. In 2015, the Heart of Dixie Railroad Museum restored the car&#x27;s exterior to its original MP 892 colors and numbering.
* Norfolk Southern Railway operates a full dome as part of its executive office car train (OCS). Former ATSF, the dome was last owned by Conrail for its own OCS train and was acquired by NS during the Conrail acquisition.
* The Indiana DOT funded &quot;Hoosier State&quot;, operated by Amtrak, had used equipment provided by Iowa Pacific which included a Budd ex-Santa Fe dome lounge, until early 2018.

==Documentary==
Dome rail travel was highlighted in the PBS-aired program &quot;Dome Car Magic&quot;. Produced by award-winning Richard Luckin, it is narrated by actor Michael Gross and chronicles the history of the railroad sightseeing cars, from Burlington&#x27;s 1945 &quot;Silver Dome&quot; to the full-length models operating today in Alaska and Canada.

<text>John H. Collins (November 14, 1902 – January 8, 1981) was an American classical scholar.

Born in Anaconda, Montana, he attended the University of Illinois and Cornell University, and in 1952 received his doctorate in classical history from Goethe University in Frankfurt-am-Main where he studied under Professor Matthias Gelzer, then a leading authority on Roman history, and prepared his doctoral dissertation on &quot;Psychology and Propaganda in Caesar&#x27;s Writings.&quot; He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Historia&quot;, &quot;The Classical Journal&quot;, and &quot;Gnomon&quot;, and achieved world recognition as an expert on Julius Caesar. In 1958 he edited with Dero A. Saunders a noted edition of Theodor Mommsen&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;.

Fluent in six languages, Collins taught at the overseas division of the University of Maryland, the University of California, Berkeley, and Northern Illinois University at DeKalb where, in 1967, he received the NIU Excellence in Teaching award. In 1971, he received an Illinois mandatory retirement notice. Not ready to retire, he sought the aid of a former student, and protégé W.R.S., who was in a position to discuss the matter with then Illinois Governor Richard Ogilvie. Mr. S. explained to the Governor that such an eminent Professor as John H. Collins was too highly respected in both American and European intellectual circles to fall victim to the state&#x27;s arbitrary mandatory retirement system. Moreover, such an arbitrary decision pursuant to these select intellectual circles would bode ill for the State of Illinois&#x27; university system. Subsequently, the decision was made to retain Dr. Collins on a different contract.

Upon Collins&#x27; retirement in 1978, a Northern Illinois University lecture hall was dedicated in his honor. He remained active in scholarly pursuits until his death in 1981.

<text>Trollech is a Czech band from Plzeň that plays black metal (Viking metal) music. The band was formed by Lord Morbivod and Asura Godwar Gorgon&#x27;s Ray in 1999 and started performing live but did not release its first album until 2001. This album&#x27;s genre has been labelled as &quot;forest pagan black metal&quot;. The lyrics throughout are in Czech and apparently follow set themes revolving around forests, trees, castles, trolls, dwarfs, weather (thunderstorms, rain) and other natural entities in the mystical realm of Trollech, of which the musicians act as guardians.

Trollech&#x27;s music is considered to be old-school pagan metal, especially their earlier albums. Their simple, yet melodic music provides support to the lyrics, the main quality of the band. Trollech uses Czech in a playful way, including frequent usage of archaic-sounding and unusual words.

<doc id="1179383" wikidata="Q1066584" url="?curid=1179383" title="Overdominance">
<text>Overdominance is a phenomenon in genetics where the phenotype of the heterozygote lies outside the phenotypical range of both homozygous parents. Overdominance can also be described as heterozygote advantage regulated by a single genomic locus, wherein heterozygous individuals have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals. However, not all cases of the heterozygote advantage are considered overdominance, as they may be regulated by multiple genomic regions. Overdominance has been hypothesized as an underlying cause for heterosis (increased fitness of hybrid offspring).

== Examples ==

=== Sickle cell anemia ===
An example of overdominance in humans is that of the sickle cell anemia. This condition is determined by a single polymorphism. Possessors of the deleterious allele have lower life expectancy, with homozygotes rarely reaching 50 years of age. However, this allele also yields some resistance to malaria. Thus in regions where malaria exerts or has exerted a strong selective pressure, sickle cell anemia has been selected for its conferred partial resistance to the disease. While homozygotes will have either no protection from malaria or a dramatic propensity to sickle cell anemia, heterozygotes have fewer physiological effects and a partial resistance to malaria.

=== Salmonoid major histocompatibility complex ===
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes exhibit extensive variation, generally attributed to the notion of heterozygous individuals identifying a wider range of peptides than homozygous individuals. In arctic char population in Finland, fish heterozygous for MHC alleles had fewer cysts, grew larger, and had a better chance at survival, all indicating a higher fitness of the heterozygotes.

=== &quot;Gymnadenia rhellicani&quot; colour polymorphism ===
In &quot;Gymnadenia rhellicani&quot;, flower pigmentation is controlled by changes to amino acids 612 and 663 in GrMYB1, which plays a role in anthocyanin pigment production. Red flowers, heterozygous with black and white alleles, maintain a reproductive fitness advantage over white and black varieties presumably because they attract both bee and fly pollinator populations. Since the emergence of the white allele, the frequency of the red phenotype has been increasing in wild populations in multiple regions of the alps.

== Polar overdominance ==
Polar overdominance is a type of overdominance where either only the paternal or maternal allele is being synthesized in the offspring. An example of this was illustrated by a famous ram named Solid Gold and his offspring. This ram was known for its callipyge phenotype (pronounced muscular features and hindquarters) caused by a mutated allele, but only 15% of its offspring received these same traits. Solid Gold’s offspring only expressed the same callipyge phenotype if they inherited the mutated allele from Solid Gold and a wildtype allele from their mother, which would result in a Cpat/Nmat genotype. Offspring with genotypes such as: Cpat/Cmat, Npat/Nmat, and Npat/Cmat did not express the callipyge phenotype.  

== Gillespie convention==
Population Geneticist John H. Gillespie established the following convention:

Where h is the heterozygote effect and s is the recessive allele effect.
Thus given a value for s (i.e.: 0&lt;s&lt;1), h can yield the following information:
For the case of sickle cell anemia the situation corresponds to the case h&lt;0 in the Gillespie Model.

<text>The Java sparrow (Lonchura oryzivora; Japanese: 文鳥, &quot;bunchō&quot;), also known as the Java finch, Java rice sparrow or Java rice bird, is a small passerine bird. This estrildid finch is a resident breeding bird in Java, Bali and Bawean in Indonesia. It is a popular cage bird, and has been introduced into many other countries.

==Taxonomy==

The Java sparrow was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia oryzivora&quot;. The specific epithet combines Latin &quot;oryza &quot; meaning &quot;rice&quot; with &quot;-vorus&quot; meaning &quot;eating&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;Padda or Rice-bird&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1743 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards believed that his specimens had come from China but mentions the common name &quot;Java sparrow&quot;. The species was reclassified to the genus &quot;Lonchura&quot; in 2020.

==Description==
The Java sparrow is about in length from the beak to its tip of tail feathers. Although only about the size of a house sparrow, it may be the largest species in the estrildid family. The mean body mass is , making it slightly heavier than its nearest known rival, the black-bellied seedeater. The adult is unmistakable, with its grey upperparts and breast, pink belly, white-cheeked black head, red eye-ring, pink feet and thick red bill.

Both sexes are similar. Immature birds have brown upperparts and pale brown underparts, and a plain head. Very young birds have a black beak with a pink base.

The call is a &quot;chip&quot;, and the song is a rapid series of call notes &quot;chipchipchipchipchipchip&quot;.

Java sparrows produce distinct trill-calls in different behavioral contexts, according to a study by Furutani et al. (2018). These trill-calls, though acoustically similar, vary based on their repetition rate, which changes depending on the situation. In aggressive interactions, the sparrows emit faster trill-calls with higher sound pressure levels and entropy. In contrast, during affiliative behaviors, the trill-calls are slower and softer. This variation in trill-calls plays a crucial role in the birds&#x27; social communication, helping them convey different intentions based on the context.

==Habitat==
The Java sparrow is a very gregarious bird which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open grassland and cultivation, and was formerly a pest in rice fields, hence its scientific name. The nest is constructed in a tree or building, and up to eight eggs are laid.

==Relation to humans==
===Aviculture===

The Java sparrow has been a popular cage bird in Asia for centuries, first in China&#x27;s Ming Dynasty and then in Japan from the 17th century, frequently appearing in Japanese paintings and prints. Meiji-era writer Natsume Sōseki wrote an essay about his pet Java sparrow. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Java sparrow was one of the most popular cage birds in the United States until its import was banned. Today it remains illegal to possess in California because of a perceived threat to agriculture, although rice-dependent Asian countries like China, Taiwan and Japan have not regulated the bird.

In Asia the Java sparrow is most often raised almost from birth by human breeders and owners, and they become very tame and attached to humans. As such, they can be normally kept in relatively small cages, but let out for indoor exercise without their attempting to escape. In captivity, a variety of colourations have been bred, including white, silver/opal, fawn/isabel, pastel, cream and agate (which currently is rare within Europe captive specimens) along with the pied Java sparrow (called the &quot;sakura buncho&quot; in Japan).

===Introductions===

The Java sparrow was introduced in the Indian subcontinent, but it failed to become a successful resident on the Indian mainland. In the United States there are breeding populations on several of the Hawaiian Islands, especially Oahu.

In the Caribbean, the Java sparrow was introduced to Puerto Rico where it is fairly common near San Juan. It has also been sighted in Jamaica, but is not known to occur on any of the other islands. It was also introduced to Christmas Island, off the coast of Western Australia.

===Conservation===
The Java sparrow is considered by some countries to be an agricultural pest with respect to rice cultivation. An ongoing loss of natural habitat, hunting in some areas and trapping (as a pest) in others has led to much smaller numbers in the wild and sightings in its natural range have become increasingly uncommon. The Java sparrow is now evaluated as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with less than 10,000 individuals remaining. It is also listed on Appendix II of CITES. The species is also severely threatened by the illegal exotic pet trade as they are sought after for their distinctive song, according to TRAFFIC.

<text>Stadion Feijenoord (), more commonly known by its nickname De Kuip (, the Tub), is a stadium in Rotterdam, Netherlands. It was completed in 1937. The name is derived from the Feijenoord district in Rotterdam, and from the club with the same name (although the club&#x27;s name was internationalised to Feyenoord in 1973).

The stadium&#x27;s original capacity was 64,000. In 1949, it was expanded to 69,000, and in 1994 it was converted to a 51,117-seat all-seater. In 1999, a significant amount of restoration and interior work took place at the stadium before its use as a venue in the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, although capacity was largely unaffected.

==History==
Leen van Zandvliet, Feyenoord&#x27;s president in the 1930s, came up with the idea of building an entirely new stadium, unlike any other on the continent, with two free hanging tiers and no obstacles blocking the view. Contemporary examples were Highbury, where the West and East stands had been recently built as a double deck, and Yankee Stadium in New York. Johannes Brinkman and Leendert van der Vlugt, the famous designers of the Van Nelle factory in Rotterdam were asked to design a stadium out of glass, concrete and steel, cheap materials at that time. The stadium was co-financed by the billionaire Daniël George van Beuningen, who made his fortune in World War I, exporting coal from Germany to Britain through neutral Netherlands.

In World War II, the stadium was nearly torn down for scrap by German occupiers. After the war, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was expanded in 1949; stadium lights were added in 1958. On 29 October 1991, De Kuip was named as being one of Rotterdam&#x27;s monuments. In 1994 the stadium was extensively renovated to its present form: It became all-seater, and the roof was extended to cover all the seats. An extra building was constructed for commercial use by Feyenoord, it also houses a restaurant and a museum, The Home of History.

=== Failed new stadium plans ===
From 2006, Feyenoord began working on plans for a new stadium, initially planned for completion in 2017 and with an estimated capacity of 85,000 seats. In 2014, Feyenoord decided to renovate the existing stadium, expanding its capacity to 70,000, as well as adding a retractable roof. Construction was planned to start in summer 2015 and finish in 2018, with an estimated €200 million cost. Plans included a new training facility costing an extra €16 million.

In March 2016, Feyenoord announced that they instead preferred building a new stadium. In May 2017, the city of Rotterdam agreed with a plan to build a new stadium with a capacity of 63,000 seats. In December 2019, Feyenoord announced that if construction of the new stadium was given in the final go-ahead in 2020 the stadium would open in the summer of 2025. On 21 April 2022, managing director Dennis te Kloesse announced that the club would not proceed with renovating the existing stadium or building a new one.

==Facilities and related buildings==
Next to De Kuip and Feyenoord&#x27;s training ground there is another, but smaller, sports arena, the Topsportcentrum Rotterdam. This arena hosts events in many sports and in various levels of competition. Some examples of sports that can be seen in the topsportcentrum are judo, volleyball and handball.

==Commercial uses==
===Football history===
De Kuip is currently the home stadium of football club Feyenoord, traditionally one of the top teams in the Netherlands. It has also long been one of the home grounds of the Netherlands national football team, having hosted over 150 international matches, the first international match at the stadium was a match against Belgium on 2 May 1937. In 1963, De Kuip staged the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, with Tottenham Hotspur becoming the first British club to win a European trophy, defeating Atlético Madrid 5–1. The stadium has hosted a record ten European finals, the last being the 2002 UEFA Cup Final in which Feyenoord, coincidentally playing a home match, defeated Borussia Dortmund 3–2. As a result, Feyenoord holds the distinction of being the only club to win a one-legged European final in their own stadium. In 2000, the Feijenoord stadium hosted the final of Euro 2000, played in the Netherlands and Belgium, where France defeated Italy 2–1 in extra time. The stadium also hosted the 2023 UEFA Nations League Final.

===Concerts===
The stadium has hosted concerts since 1978. The first show was headlined by Bob Dylan, with special guest Eric Clapton, on 23 June 1978. David Bowie held his dress rehearsals and subsequently opened his 1987 Glass Spider Tour at the stadium. In 1995, René Froger became the first Dutch artist to headline at De Kuip, and he sold out two shows. In 2008, Kane became the first Dutch band to headline the stadium. In 2019, Marco Borsato held five concerts at De Kuip to increase his total to 14, breaking The Rolling Stones&#x27; past venue record of 10.

In April 2024, the municipality of Rotterdam announced that concerts would no longer take place at De Kuip beginning in 2026 to eliminate noise pollution in the area with the construction of new houses nearby. De Kuip will receive 12 million euros from Rotterdam as compensation. Three concerts from the Dutch band Di-rect from 12 to 14 June 2025 are scheduled to be the final shows in the stadium.

<text>Scott Stapp (born Anthony Scott Flippen; August 8, 1973) is an American singer and the lead vocalist and lyricist of the rock band Creed. He has also fronted the band Art of Anarchy and has released four solo albums.

Stapp has received several accolades, including numerous RIAA certifications. Stapp and Creed bandmate Mark Tremonti won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 2001 as the writers of the Creed song &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Hit Parader&quot; ranked Stapp as the 68th-greatest heavy metal vocalist.

==Career==
===Creed===
Stapp was a founding member and the original lead vocalist of American rock band Creed. After meeting his future bandmate Mark Tremonti at Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando, Florida, Stapp reunited with Tremonti while both attended Florida State University. The two quickly developed a friendship based on their mutual passion for music. Stapp formed Creed with Tremonti in 1994, with fellow members Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips joining as bassist and drummer, respectively.

The band released its debut album &quot;My Own Prison&quot; in 1997 to mainstream success, selling over six million copies. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, &quot;Torn&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s This Life For&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;. All four singles reached the Top Three on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album was followed in 1999 by &quot;Human Clay&quot;, which was an immediate success and certified diamond and eleven times platinum by the RIAA.

The band released another multi-platinum selling album, &quot;Weathered&quot;, in 2001. The tour to support this record was overwhelmingly successful but ended with a controversial concert in Chicago. This concert ultimately led to the band&#x27;s breakup.

In 2004, Creed announced that it had disbanded, citing tension between Stapp and the other members. Creed released its &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in November 2004.

In 2009, it was announced that Creed had reunited. The band&#x27;s fourth record, &quot;Full Circle&quot;, was released in October 2009. Creed supported the album by touring throughout North and South America, Europe, and Australia during the summers of 2009 and 2010.

In March 2012, Stapp reconvened with his Creed bandmates to rehearse for their &quot;2 Nights&quot; tour, during which the band performed its first two albums, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; and &quot;Human Clay&quot;, back to back in their entirety. It was announced that Stapp and Mark Tremonti would enter the studio to start recording new songs in June, but no progress was made. In October 2013, Stapp noted in an interview that extensive work was done on the new album throughout 2011 and 2012. However, the project was suddenly abandoned, and Stapp stated he was unaware of the reason. Stapp also hinted that the relationship between himself and Tremonti had once again broken down, leaving the future of the band uncertain. Mark Tremonti said that his relationship with Stapp went south during the reunion tour when Stapp indicated that he thought Mark would end Alter Bridge to focus solely on Creed, which Mark was not willing to do under any circumstance.

In 2014, Stapp maintained that the band was still together.

On July 17, 2023, Creed announced they will reunite for their first shows in 12 years in 2024, when they set sail the &quot;Summer of &#x27;99&quot; cruise in April 2024 as headliners of the rock voyage.

===Solo career and contributions: 2004–present===
After Creed announced its breakup in 2004, Stapp recorded the song &quot;Relearn Love&quot; with 7 Aurelius and The Tea Party for the album &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Songs&quot;, a collection of tracks inspired by the 2004 Mel Gibson film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. He then began working on his debut solo album. Titled &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, the record was released in the U.S. on November 22, 2005, peaking at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, &quot;Justify&quot;, and &quot;Surround Me&quot; were released as singles. The album was certified platinum on December 14, 2005. &quot;The Great Divide&quot; has since reached double platinum.

Stapp was ranked as the 68th greatest heavy metal vocalist of all time by &quot;Hit Parader&quot; in 2006.

On August 18, 2010, Stapp wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m stripping down all the Creed hits, as well as my solo material, in a manner fans have never heard before but have long been screaming for.&quot; Creed&#x27;s touring rhythm guitarist Eric Friedman joined Stapp on the acoustic tour. The short solo acoustic tour began September 28, 2010, and concluded November 20, 2010.

In the spring of 2010, Stapp recorded an anthem for the National League baseball team the Florida Marlins entitled &quot;Marlins Will Soar&quot;. The song was a rewrite of Stapp&#x27;s song &quot;You Will Soar,&quot; using different lyrics and a slightly different melody in the verses. According to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;Marlins Will Soar&quot; was met with extremely negative reviews.

Stapp appeared on Carlos Santana&#x27;s solo album &quot;Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time&quot;, a cover album on which Stapp sings on the cover of the Creedence Clearwater Revival song &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;. The album was released on September 21, 2010.

Stapp confirmed in 2010 that his next solo album would be devoted to the topics of lust and love. Eleven tracks from the album were recorded in late 2010. The album was later shelved indefinitely. A song from this unreleased album, &quot;A Prayer for Sunrise&quot;, was released in 2012 to promote Stapp&#x27;s autobiography.

In 2013, Stapp released his second solo album, &quot;Proof of Life&quot;. On October 8, 2013, the song &quot;Slow Suicide&quot; went to radio.

On March 22, 2019, Stapp released the single &quot;Purpose for Pain&quot;. His album &quot;The Space Between the Shadows&quot; was released on July 19, 2019. Stapp began touring in support of the album in June 2019. In mid-2019, Stapp planned to tour the United States with American rock band Messer.

In 2021, Stapp collaborated with electronic dance music artists Wooli and Trivecta on their song &quot;Light Up The Sky&quot;, which was released on Ophelia Records.

===Art of Anarchy: 2016–2018 ===
On May 3, 2016, Stapp announced that he would replace Scott Weiland (who died on December 3, 2015) as the lead singer of Art of Anarchy. &quot;The Madness&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single with Stapp as lead singer, was released in August 2016. The band released its second album (and first with Stapp), also called &quot;The Madness&quot;, on March 24, 2017. The album has received critical accolades. The album also received a 10/10 rating from Amps and Green Screens.

In February 2018, it was reported that Stapp was being sued by Art of Anarchy for allegedly refusing to promote &quot;The Madness&quot; or tour in support of the album, having breached contractual obligations in the process.

===Acting===
In December 2020, it was announced that Stapp would portray Frank Sinatra in a biopic film based on the life of U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

==Philanthropy==
In 2000, Stapp founded the With Arms Wide Open Foundation, a nonprofit organization &quot;dedicated to helping underprivileged children and families around the world.&quot; The foundation has donated over $1 million to various causes.

In early 2012, to promote fundraising for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Stapp and his wife, in cooperation with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, IsraAid, the U.S. Armed Forces, and the United Service Organizations, traveled to Japan and visited with victims of the tsunami in affected towns including Sendai and Ishinomaki along Japan&#x27;s northeast coastline. Stapp also performed an acoustic show on board the USS &quot;George Washington&quot; at the Yokosuka Naval Base for U.S. troops stationed in Japan to thank and express his appreciation for them.

==Personal life==
Stapp was born Anthony Scott Flippen on August 8, 1973, in Orlando, Florida. He was raised by his mother, Lynda, and his stepfather, Steven Stapp, a dentist, whose surname he took. Bands that influenced him to pursue a music career included Def Leppard and U2. He was also influenced by Elvis Presley due to his mother being a big fan and got into the school choir by singing Elvis songs His first show that he ever performed in was when he was nine years old and he performed &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles at Bear Lake Elementary School in the auditorium. He graduated from Lake Highland Preparatory School.

Stapp is a Christian. &quot;I would feel a connection with God when I wrote the words and then when I would sing the songs, learning the songs, I would feel the Holy Spirit,&quot; confirmed Stapp in a 2013 interview. He wrote a memoir, &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Creed&quot;, which was released by Tyndale House on October 2, 2012. In a podcast interview with Theo Von, he claimed that his parents would physically abuse him &quot;in the name of God&quot;, and that he&#x27;d live his life &quot;on a timer&quot;, having to finish certain activities by a certain time to avoid further punishment.

Stapp stated in his memoir that his maternal grandfather was of Cherokee ancestry.

===Family===
In 1997, Stapp married Hillaree Burns. They were married for sixteen months and divorced in 1998. Stapp has a son, Jagger, with Burns. After the couple&#x27;s divorce, Stapp retained full custody of Jagger.

On February 11, 2006, Stapp married 2004 Miss New York USA winner and model Jaclyn Nesheiwat. Together they have a daughter and a son. In November 2014, Jaclyn filed for divorce. The couple eventually sought help and continued together. The couple had their third child, a son, in November 2017. In May 2023, Stapp reportedly filed for a divorce over 11 months after a divorce, which was originally filed by Jaclyn, was withdrawn. According to a source, he and Jaclyn knew the marriage was falling apart but continued to try and make it work. The divorce is yet to be finalized.

===Legal and personal troubles===

In 2003, Stapp contemplated suicide after drinking a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey. He retrieved two MP5s from his collection and put the guns to his head, but did not pull the triggers after looking at a picture of his son, Jagger. He later said he had been convinced that anyone involved with Creed wanted him dead so he would become a &quot;Kurt Cobain martyr-type&quot; and increase record sales. Says Stapp, &quot;I had crazy thoughts going through my head.&quot; He later said that instead of killing himself, he fired a few rounds in his home. He said, &quot;I was in the throes of prednisone coming out of my body [...] I shot a few rounds off and instantly was like, &#x27;What the hell am I doing?&#x27; So I put the guns away and ran out to the garage and got the putty and patched the holes.&quot;

On Thanksgiving night of 2005, Stapp was involved in a fight with members of the band 311 at the Harbor Court Hotel in Baltimore. Members of 311 have said Stapp started the fight. After five minutes, hotel security broke up the fight and removed Stapp from the hotel. Stapp claimed that he did not instigate the altercation.

Stapp was arrested on February 12, 2006 (one day after his second wedding), for suspected intoxication.

In March 2006, Stapp filed a lawsuit to block the release of a sex video involving himself, Kid Rock, and four women. The suit was settled in 2007, with the defendant agreeing to pay Stapp an undisclosed sum and to refrain from distributing the video.

Stapp has said he attempted suicide in Miami in 2006. According to Stapp, he jumped over a balcony and fell 40 feet, fracturing his skull and breaking his hip and nose. He credited rapper T.I. with saving his life, stating, &quot;I laid out there for two and a half hours and my guardian angel showed up. He immediately took care of the situation and saved my life.&quot; T.I. confirmed the incident, although he did not know who Stapp was at the time.

In a 2006 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Stapp acknowledged that he had become addicted to Percocet, Xanax, and was withdrawing from prednisone for vocal cord inflammation during Creed&#x27;s tour in support of &quot;Weathered&quot;.

On May 20, 2007, Stapp was charged with one count of felony assault stemming from a domestic violence incident. Stapp was later set free on supervised release. Stapp apologized to his wife and the public on May 23, 2007, and the charge was later dropped.

In 2015, Stapp told &quot;People&quot; he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder following a psychotic break. He commented that the diagnosis was &quot;a big sign of relief, because finally, we had an answer&quot; about the reasons for his mental health difficulties. In the same interview, Stapp indicated that he was sober and working through a 12-step program.

<doc id="1179391" wikidata="Q476397" url="?curid=1179391" title="Bidayuh">
<text>Bidayuh is the collective name for several indigenous groups found in southern Sarawak, Malaysia and northern West Kalimantan, Indonesia, on the island of Borneo, which are broadly similar in language and culture (see also issues below). The name &quot;Bidayuh&quot; means &#x27;inhabitants of land&#x27;. Originally from the western part of Borneo, the collective name Land Dayak was first used during the period of Rajah James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak. At times, they were also lesser referred to as [[Klemantan people]]. They constitute one of the main indigenous groups in Sarawak and West Kalimantan and live in towns and villages around Kuching and Serian in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, while in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan they are mainly concentrated in the northern Sanggau Regency. In Sarawak, most of Bidayuh population can be found within 40 km of the geographical area known as Greater Kuching, within the Kuching and Serian Division. They are the second-largest Dayak ethnic group in Sarawak after the Iban and one of the major Dayak tribes in West Kalimantan.

== Settlement areas ==

Predominantly Bidayuh areas in Sarawak are in the suburban areas of the state capital city of Kuching (Penrissen as well as Padawan areas), Lundu, Siburan, Bau and Serian. Most Bidayuh villages can be found in the rural areas of Padawan, Lundu, Penrissen, Bau and Serian. The area continues up to the adjacent West Kalimantan border, where they reside in Kembayan, Noyan, Sekayam, and Jangkang district in Sanggau Regency. The area in which they live is mainly in the basin of the Sarawak River and hilly to a mountainous forest, traditionally worked by rotational agriculture and hunting based around farms populated from parent villages situated on the hills for protection. Today, almost all the traditional longhouse villages have been replaced by individual houses, by roads and there are some plantation agriculture and a reduced emphasis on the growing of hill padi. Fruit trees, especially Durian, remain important property markers. The distinctive architectural and cultural feature of the Bidayuh is the head-house, now adopted as a symbol.

== Languages ==

There are approximately 25 dialects of Bidayuh (Land Dayak) spoken in Sarawak, Malaysia, which can be grouped into four clusters of dialects: Eastern, Central, Highland, and Western. In Sarawak, there are generally said to be three main linguistic groupings (Biatah, Singai-Jagoi, and Bukar–Sadong), but these can be broken down even beyond the list referenced below as most people can be distinguished by locals down to village level through smaller differences in vocabulary and intonation. Each area speaks its own dialect:

# Lundu speaks &quot;Jagoi&quot;, &quot;Salako&quot; and &quot;Lara&quot;.
# Bratak, Singai, Krokong, and Jagoi speak &quot;Singai-Jagoi&quot;.
# Penrissen speaks &quot;Bisitang&quot; while people in Kampung Bunuk speak &quot;Bunuk&quot; (Segu-Benuk).
# Siburan vicinity speaks &quot;Biatah&quot;.
# Bidayuhs who live around Serian such as Tebakang, Mongkos, Tebedu to Tanjung Amo near the border of Kalimantan, Indonesia speak &quot;Sadong(Similar To Bukar but different dialects and accent)&quot;.
# Bidayuhs who live around Serian such as Baki, Baru, Taee, and Tarat speaks the &quot;Bukar language&quot;.
# Bidayuhs in Padawan speak several but related dialects like &quot;Bi-Annah&quot;, &quot;Pinyawa&quot;, &quot;Braang, Bia&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Bisepug,&quot; and &quot;Emperoh/Bipuruh&quot;.
# Bidayuh Moden speaks mixed languages, mixed languages between &quot;Padawan&quot; and &quot;Jagoi language&quot; (Semeba, Tematu, Bumbok, and Sudad).
The dialects are not mutually intelligible and Malaysian English or Malay are often used as commonly spoken languages within the community.

=== Linguistic issues ===

The Serian Bidayuhs have a distinct dialect known as &quot;Bukar–Sadong&quot;, which is not intelligible to Bidayuhs from other Districts. Here are some examples of the differences in the various dialects spoken in Serian, with their English and Malay equivalents. Also included are two Philippine languages, Kapampangan and Tagalog:
== Religion and beliefs ==
Bidayuhs are traditionally animist or pagans, and vestiges of these beliefs remain. The Brooke family era saw the arrival of Christian missionaries from 1848, bringing education and modern medicine, while a similar process also took place in Dutch Borneo on the Dutch controlled side. The great majority of Bidayuh are now Christians, majority of them being Roman Catholic. Almost 70% of the people of Bidayuh have changed their traditional name to English name since they converted to Christianity and many young indigenous Bidayuh in Sarawak do not practice their traditional ceremonies anymore, weakening their culture as indigenous peoples of Sarawak. The Bidayuh people are the closest relative of the Melanau people and are said to have the same ancestor before splitting into different tribes. The original Bidayuhs are mainly pagans or animists, however 50% already converted to Christianity. They have big festivals like Gawai Dayak, which is a celebration to please the padi spirit for a good harvest.

Most Bidayuh villages have either a Roman Catholic or Anglican church, or a mosque. The Biatah people, who live in the Kuching area (Padawan/Lundu), are mostly Anglican with Catholic minorities. Meanwhile, the people who live in Bau or Serian are mostly Catholic. Catholicism was first introduced to people in Kampung Taee by the Mill Hill Missionaries in the early 1920s.

Some renowned churches were also being established in some villages such as SIB (Sidang Injil Borneo) also known as the Borneo Evangelical Mission (BEM) church, Baptist as well as other denominations like Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA), Assemblies of God, Methodist, Latter Rain, etc.

The Bidayuh of Bukar had a unique tradition of hanging the bodies of the dead on trees and leaving them to rot away. The skeletons are left on trees as a reminder of the dead. The tradition is rarely practiced nowadays.

The Bidayuh or Klemantan celebrate Gawai Padi (Paddy Festival) or Gawai Adat Naik Dingo (Paddy Storing Festival).

== Salako and Lara people ==

Although classified as &quot;Bidayuh&quot; by the Malaysian government, the Salako and Lara culture have little resemblance to other Bidayuh groups and their oral tradition claims different descent and migration histories. Linguistically, the Salako belong to another language family tree which is of the Malayic Dayak family (the same family as the Iban). The Lara, although said to be more related to the Bidayuh (Jagoi-Singai), speak a language almost not mutually intelligible at all with the Bidayuh but belonged to the same language family tree which is the Land Dayak. Even their customary rituals and rites differ from the other Bidayuhs (all Bidayuhs share almost the same ritual and customary rites).

== Culture ==
=== Musical heritage ===
The Bidayuh have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles - ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as a drone without any accompanying melodic instrument. They also use a bamboo idiochord tube zither called &quot;pratuokng&quot;.

=== Traditional dance ===
* Nyigar

===Traditional cuisine===
Several traditional Bidayuh dishes are:
* &quot;Kasam Dihan goreng&quot;, fried fermented durian with pork and lemongrass condiment
* &quot;Rotung&quot;, sago cooked in bamboo
* &quot;Kubar&quot;, sweet sago pancakes
* &quot;&quot;, sticky sago paste
* &quot;Assam&quot;, chicken and tapioca leaves cooked and served in a bamboo stalk
* &quot;Tobah / Kasam Pengak&quot;, preserved wild animal meat or pork, and fish

== Standard of Living ==

According to Professor Dr Peter Songan (graduate from Cornell University, in Year 2004 the Bidayuh Graduate community by category of qualificationA majority of the graduates holds a diploma degree (45.1%), followed by bachelor (44.2%), masters (5.2%), Ph.D. (0.9%) and others (4.7%).

Table 2. Distribution of Graduates by Degree Frequency Percent
Diploma 743 holders 45.06%
Bachelor 729 holders 44.21%
Masters 85 holders 5.16%
Ph.D. 15 holders 0.91%
Others 77 holders 4.67%
Total 1649 holders 100.00%

==Notable Bidayuhs==
* Cornelis, former governor of West Kalimantan.
* Anding Indrawani Zaini, an &quot;Akademi Fantasia&quot; star, model, actor and singer. He is of mixed Melanau-Bidayuh parentage.
* Bonnie Bunyau Gustin, national powerlifter who won Malaysia&#x27;s first ever gold medal in the sport in the men&#x27;s 72 kg event at the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, breaking the Paralympic record in the process.

<doc id="1179395" wikidata="Q1628627" url="?curid=1179395" title="Left ventricular hypertrophy">
<text>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is thickening of the heart muscle of the left ventricle of the heart, that is, left-sided ventricular hypertrophy and resulting increased left ventricular mass.

==Causes==
While ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training, it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease, or high blood pressure. It is one aspect of ventricular remodeling.

While LVH itself is not a disease, it is usually a marker for disease involving the heart. Disease processes that can cause LVH include any disease that increases the afterload that the heart has to contract against, and some primary diseases of the muscle of the heart.
Causes of increased afterload that can cause LVH include aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency and hypertension. Primary disease of the muscle of the heart that cause LVH are known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, which can lead into heart failure.

Long-standing mitral insufficiency also leads to LVH as a compensatory mechanism.

LV mass increases with ageing.

Associated genes include OGN, osteoglycin.

==Diagnosis==
The commonly used method to diagnose LVH is echocardiography, with which the thickness of the muscle of the heart can be measured. The electrocardiogram (ECG) often shows signs of increased voltage from the heart in individuals with LVH, so this is often used as a screening test to determine who should undergo further testing.

===Echocardiography===

Two dimensional echocardiography can produce images of the left ventricle. The thickness of the left ventricle as visualized on echocardiography correlates with its actual mass. Left ventricular mass can be further estimated based on geometric assumptions of ventricular shape using the measured wall thickness and internal diameter. Average thickness of the left ventricle, with numbers given as 95% prediction interval for the short axis images at the mid-cavity level are:
* Women: 4 – 8 mm
* Men: 5 – 9 mm

=== CT &amp; MRI ===
CT and MRI-based measurement can be used to measure the left ventricle in three dimensions and calculate left ventricular mass directly. MRI based measurement is considered the “gold standard” for left ventricular mass, though is usually not readily available for common practice. In older individuals, age related remodeling of the left ventricle&#x27;s geometry can lead to a discordancy between CT and echocardiographic based measurements of left ventricular mass.

===ECG criteria===

There are several sets of criteria used to diagnose LVH via electrocardiography. None of them are perfect, though by using multiple criteria sets, the sensitivity and specificity are increased.

The Sokolow-Lyon index:
* S in V1 + R in V5 or V6 (whichever is larger) ≥ 35 mm (≥ 7 large squares)
* R in aVL ≥ 11 mm

The Cornell voltage criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LVH involve measurement of the sum of the R wave in lead aVL and the S wave in lead V3. The Cornell criteria for LVH are:
* S in V3 + R in aVL &gt; 28 mm (men)
* S in V3 + R in aVL &gt; 20 mm (women)

The Romhilt-Estes point score system (&quot;diagnostic&quot; &gt;5 points; &quot;probable&quot; 4 points):

Other voltage-based criteria for LVH include:
* Lead I: R wave &gt; 14 mm
* Lead aVR: S wave &gt; 15 mm
* Lead aVL: R wave &gt; 12 mm
* Lead aVF: R wave &gt; 21 mm
* Lead V5: R wave &gt; 26 mm
* Lead V6: R wave &gt; 20 mm

Diagnostic accuracy of electrocardiography in left ventricular hypertrophy can be enhanced with artificial intelligence analysis.

==Treatment==
Treatment is typically focused on resolving the cause of the LVH with the enlargement not permanent in all cases. In some cases the growth can regress with the reduction of blood pressure.

LVH may be a factor in determining treatment or diagnosis for other conditions, for example, LVH is used in the staging and risk stratification of Non-ischemic cardiomyopathies such as Fabry&#x27;s Disease. Patients with LVH may have to participate in more complicated and precise diagnostic procedures, such as echocardiography or cardiac MRI.

<doc id="1179396" wikidata="Q2164694" url="?curid=1179396" title="Cattle grid">
<text>A cattle grid – also known as a stock grid in Australia; cattle guard, or cattle grate in American English; vehicle pass, or stock gap in the Southeastern United States; Texas gate in western Canada and the northwestern United States; and a cattle stop in New Zealand English – is a type of obstacle used to prevent livestock, such as sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, or mules from passing along a road or railway which penetrates the fencing surrounding an enclosed piece of land or border. It consists of a depression in the road covered by a transverse grid of bars or tubes, normally made of metal and firmly fixed to the ground on either side of the depression, so that the gaps between them are wide enough for an animal&#x27;s feet to enter, but sufficiently narrow not to impede a wheeled vehicle or human foot. This provides an effective barrier to animals without impeding wheeled vehicles, as the animals are reluctant to walk on the grates.

==Origins==
The modern cattle grid for roads used by automobiles is said to have been independently invented a number of times on the Great Plains of the United States around 1905–1915. Before that period, a similar device for railroads was in use at least as early as 1836; a stone stile was used in Britain as far back as pre-Roman times. An article in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; claims that the &quot;first recorded use of a cattle grid for nonrail traffic&quot; occurred in 1881 in Archer County, Texas, on the stagecoach road between Archer City and Henrietta.

==Uses==

Cattle grids are usually installed on roads where they cross a fenceline, often at a boundary between public and private lands. They are an alternative to the erection of gates that would need to be opened and closed when a vehicle passes, and are common where roads cross open moorland, rangeland or common land maintained by grazing, but where segregation of fields is impractical. Cattle grids are also used when otherwise unfenced railways cross a fenceline. Cattle grids are common worldwide and are widespread in places such as Australia, the Scottish Highlands, or the National Parks of England and Wales. They are also common throughout the Western United States and Canada. In the United States, they are often used on Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land, but are also used on paved roads and entry and exit ramps of the Interstate Highway System in rural areas.

==Variations==
Almost all cattle grids are built around a grid. Most include a pit dug along a fence line, a base for the grid to rest on, and wings to connect the guard to the fence. Since many guards were or are home-made and to some degree idiosyncratic, a wide variety of designs exist. Designs may vary with local conditions. Materials used for construction of a cattle grid depend partly on the weight it must bear.

A study of the bars of traditional cattle grids in the Flint Hills of Kansas found that 80 percent were made of pipe, while smaller percentages were made of railroad rails, I-beams, planks, and other materials. The size of the bars varied from ; the spaces between bars varied from ; the number of bars per grid varied from 4 to 22. Grids differed in length from and in width from , while the pits beneath grids were deep.

Cattle grids, as they are called in Great Britain, Ireland, and South Africa, are known by a wide variety of other names in other parts of the world. In the United States, they are &quot;cattle guards&quot;. (&#x27;donkey killer&#x27;) is the preferred name in Brazil and Venezuela, while (&#x27;cattle keeper&#x27;) is what they are called in Argentina. Alternatives in the United States include &quot;car crossing, auto gate, corduroy gate, stock gap, cattle pass, run-over&quot;, and many others. Canadians use &quot;pit gate, vehicle pass&quot;, and &quot;Texas gate&quot;, as well as &quot;cattle guard&quot;, which in Canada refers mainly to guards at railway lines.

===Concrete===
Cattle grids made entirely or mostly of concrete have existed since the 1940s. Individual ranchers have often constructed their own, sometimes using plans developed in the 1940s. In the 21st century, a set of plans for do-it-yourself guards made of wood and concrete are available via the web site of the Missouri Alternatives Center at the University of Missouri in the US. Commercial precast concrete versions are also available; Smith Cattleguard Company, based in Virginia, sold more than 15,000 of them between 1960 and 1980. Manufacturers also produce commercial polyethylene forms with reinforcing rods. Placed in or on the ground and filled, a finished cattle grid with concrete reinforced with fiberglass (GFRP) rebar can support vehicle loads of up to per axle.

===Steel===
University Lands, which manages land and mineral interests for a foundation supporting the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M University systems, publishes do-it-yourself manuals for three sizes of cattle grids with grids made of steel pipes. The manuals include schematic drawings as well as accompanying instructions. Commercial guards made of steel are also available from multiple companies.

===Virtual===
Painted lines on the road can serve as skeuomorphs of cattle grids. The light-dark pattern of lines on pavement resembles a true cattle grid to animals, and by association think they will not be able to cross. Using a virtual cattle grid is initially cheaper than a true cattle grid, but the cost of periodic re-painting may eventually exceed the initial cost of a well-built metal guard. A particular advantage of painted guards is that they are smooth to drive over; in the US, most are found on state or federal highways, rather than private roads. 

Why they work is unclear, but it is most likely related to the bovine visual system. Experts say that &quot;a cow&#x27;s depth perception is such that it makes little or no distinction between painted stripes on a dark background and bars over a pit.&quot; Cattle may acquire the behavior of avoiding grids over pits either from individual experience or through imitation of other cattle. However, painted grids have been reported to work with semi-wild cattle with no prior exposure to virtual grids.

Cattle can sometimes defeat virtual guards. A station owner in Queensland, Australia, told a reporter that after some of his old bulls leaped a painted grid, the younger ones lost their fear of walking across. This is common; if one member of a herd discovers it can step safely on the lines, others will follow. Other incentives that lead cattle to test a virtual guard include placing food on the opposite side, or using strong driving pressure to run panicked cattle over a virtual grid.

===Electric===
Electric cattle grids use electricity to deter animals from crossing the fence line. There are different designs. One uses high-tensile wire run across the roadway, about off the ground, attached to a power source on one side. The primary advantage is cost and ease of installation. Drawbacks include the necessity of spraying vegetation with herbicides to keep weeds from shorting out the grid if there is no barrier between the wires and the ground. In addition, some low-riding vehicles can catch the wires and tear them out.

James Hoy in &quot;The Cattle Guard&quot; discusses four kinds of electric guards. One that was patented in Illinois in 1955 and another invented in New Zealand in 1979 are similar; each resemble &quot;something like the framework of an old-fashioned metal bed&quot; connected to a battery or high-powered fence charger. They are easy to drive across, but may pose a danger to children or animals that get stuck in the guard. Another type was patented in two versions by an Oregon inventor in 1956–57; it consisted of 20 current-carrying synthetic rubber strips mounted on a wooden frame. The invention proved highly effective in deterring all animals, including dogs, and it was maintenance free, easy to drive over, and safe. However, the company that acquired the manufacturing rights stopped production in 1960. A fourth type, homemade, consists of two sections of woven wire or steel plate laid on a concrete slab and set apart from one another on either side of a fenceline. The wire sections are then connected to an electric fence or to a separate charger, either conventional or solar-powered.

==Effectiveness on wildlife==

While cattle grids are most effective on cattle, they can be used to exclude deer and elk. Research has shown that deer can cross cattle grids with flat, as opposed to rounded bars. Sometimes a cattle grid is doubled to exclude these animals. A cattle grid requiring a horizontal leap of is considered effective when combined with a deer fence. Striping is also painted on roads as a visual deterrent to deer, as with &quot;virtual&quot; cattle grids.

==Limitations and risks==

While these barriers are usually effective for cattle, they can fail due to ingenious animals. Sheep searching for food have been known to jump across grids, step carefully into the spaces, or run along the side of grids as wide as .

Wider grids are used where wildlife is to be contained. Some animals can jump across them, and a barrier that stops deer needs to be at least wide. Bison, and bulls in particular can easily jump across an barrier, and have been known to jump widths of up to .

In areas with heavy snowfall and long periods without a thaw, snow can accumulate beneath a grid and allow animals to walk across.

Horses are particularly vulnerable to cattle grid injuries, as their single-toed hooves can slip between the bars and trap their legs in an easily broken position. The same risk exists for kangaroos in Australia&#x27;s outback, with additional risk of entrapment.

Cattle grids are generally useless for containing goats. However, a Texas Highway Department official reported that adding three painted stripes—arranged yellow, white, yellow—on the road in front of a cattle grid deterred goats from approaching or crossing the guard.

Cattle grids produce noise when vehicles pass over them and people living in a 100 m radius from the grid can be affected.

==Patents and standards==
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (US PTO) issued patent on January 15, 1915, to William J. Hickey, Reno, Nevada, for a cattle grid.

There is a British Standard for cattle grids: &quot;BS4008:2006&quot;. The US standards are put forth by The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). AASHTO provides load rating guidelines for cattle grids that are used on public roads in the US. All cattle grids used on US public roads must be certified by a qualified engineer that the grid meets AASHTO guidelines.

<text>Bellenden Seymour Hutcheson (16 December 1883 – 9 April 1954) was an American-born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) during the First World War. The VC is the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Hutcheson was one of the seven Canadians to be awarded the Victoria Cross for their deeds on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions across the 30 km long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six were Arthur George Knight, William Henry Metcalf, Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney, Cyrus Wesley Peck, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young.

==Biography==
Hutcheson was a graduate of Northwestern University Medical School. In 1915, he renounced his United States citizenship in order to join the Canadian Army as a medical officer. He reclaimed his American citizenship after the war.

He was 34 years old, and a captain in the Canadian Army Medical Corps, Canadian Expeditionary Force, attached to 75th (Mississauga) Battalion, during the First World War. He was awarded the MC in 1918 for attended to and dressing the wounded.

On 2 September 1918 in France, Captain Hutcheson went through the Drocourt-Quéant Support Line with his battalion, remaining on the field until every wounded man had been attended to. He dressed the wounds of a seriously hurt officer under terrific machine-gun and shell fire, and with the help of prisoners and his own men, succeeded in evacuating the officer to safety. Immediately afterwards, he rushed forward in full view of the enemy to attend a wounded sergeant, and having placed him in a shell-hole, dressed his wounds.

The citation reads:

==Legacy==
The 75th Battalion&#x27;s lineage is today continued by the Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&#x27;s Own), a reserve infantry regiment of the Canadian Forces. In 2009 a new armoury was opened in Etobicoke for the regiment. This facility was named in honour of Captain Hutcheson.

<doc id="1179402" wikidata="Q7501400" url="?curid=1179402" title="Shoreditch railway station">
<text>Shoreditch was a railway station on the North London Railway (NLR) in Shoreditch, London, that was in use from 1865 to 1940. It was situated on a viaduct between Haggerston and Broad Street stations. It should not be confused with Shoreditch Underground station (1869–2006) on the London Underground, situated about half a mile further south. It was also not the first main line railway station to possess the Shoreditch name; Bishopsgate (1840–1875) was originally given that name.

== Pre grouping history (1865-1922) ==
When the East &amp; West India Docks &amp; Birmingham Junction Railway (known as the North London Railway (NLR) from 1853) started operating on 26 September 1850, they shared a London terminus at Fenchurch Street railway station with the London and Blackwall Railway which involved a circuitous route from north London via Hackney, Bow and East Stepney for city bound passengers. An act of parliament saw the NLR apply to build a two-mile extension from Dalston to a new London terminus at Broad Street railway station (England). This was passed in 1861 and the majority of the line was built on a viaduct now known as the Dalston Viaduct. A significant number of properties were demolished to make way for the new railway.

The original railway had three tracks and Shoreditch station had three platform faces. It was situated partly on the viaduct and partly on the bridge over Old Street. It was a flat roofed square two storey brick station building located on the corner of Kingsland Road and Old Street. Connor suggests the ticket office was at street level and stairs took you up to platform level which were accommodated within the building. The structure had a number of elegant arched windows and was typical of many NLR stations. There were a number of structures, mostly of timber construction, on the platforms containing offices, waiting rooms etc.

The station was opened on 1 November 1865 - the same date as Broad Street and services started operating to Poplar (East India Road) station.

A fourth track which did not have a platform face was added in July 1874 and used by other NLR passenger services (e.g. to Richmond) and goods trains to and from Broad Street goods depots.

The first signal box was located north of the island platform between the two sets of running lines and this was relocated on 5 December 1875 during platform lengthening work. A second signal box was added (about halfway up the island platform on the west side of the line) in April 1893 and the two signal boxes were named Shoreditch No 1 and Shoreditch No 2 (the new box). This arrangement lasted until 1909 when No 1 box was abolished and No 2 box reverted to the name Shoreditch. Tram traffic began to take a sizable part of the stations business during the early part of the 20th Century and Sunday services were withdrawn on 20 May 1918. 
The London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR) took over the working of the North London Railway under a common management arrangement on 1 February 1909 although the North London Railway continued to exist until 1922.

In 1916 the two westerly lines were electrified for Broad Street to Richmond services and the two sets of running lines were known as No. 2 Electrics (west side of viaduct) and No 1 Steam (east side of the viaduct). A few up electric services did call at Shoreditch as there was no fourth platform provided.

It was initially served by local services from Broad Street to Poplar (East India Road) railway station on the City Extension of the North London Railway. Between 1870 and 1890 some Poplar services were extended to/from Blackwall on the Great Eastern Railway line from Fenchurch Street.

Later Great Northern Railway services to New Barnet, Alexandra Palace, High Barnet and Gordon Hill called during the peak hours.

=== Shoreditch (Dunloe Street depot) ===
This depot handled coal traffic and was located a quarter of a mile north of the station on the east side of the line. It was opened by the LNWR in March 1893 and closed in June 1968.

A signal box was located here on the west side of the line. This opened in 1892 and was closed in 1976.

The eastward extension that used to accommodate the site has been largely demolished and appears to be used for container storage at the northern end. A small section exists south of Cremer Street which is where the southern rail exit to the sidings was located.

== London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (1923-1940) ==
Following the Railways Act 1921, also known as the grouping act, operation of the station fall under the control of the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway.

The station building was replaced between 1925 and 1928 as part of a road widening scheme undertaken by the London County Council and was an attractive three story pale red brick building built in the style of the time. The design was complemented by stone work including the words &quot;LM1928SR&quot; and the winged symbol they then used. The exit was at the corner of Kingsland Road and Old Street and the arrival hall attractively laid out in ceramic tiles. These were a buff colour with burnt orange, black and brown detailing. The subway to the island was done out in white glazed brick and the station building now included a parcels office.

Following that, services were withdrawn on 6 October 1940 following air raid damage in World War II elsewhere on the line although Connor suggests trains had not run for some weeks previously. The station stayed open selling tickets until 17 November 1941.

== After closure (1940-present day) ==

The Poplar service continued to pass through Shoreditch but this was withdrawn on 15 May 1944 due to bomb damage between Dalston and Poplar and declining passenger numbers.

The following August the station building was slightly damaged by a V-1 rocket explosion.

After the war the station building was taken over by a dress making firm. The wooden platform awnings were taken down between 1953 and 1956 and during late 1965 most of the other timber platform level buildings were removed down. The buildings that housed the stairwells survived along with some brick structures but these succumbed in late 1971. The platforms also remained intact until they were demolished in 2005, in conjunction with the East London line extension project.

The &quot;Steam&quot; lines (also known as No 1 lines) were lifted sometime during the 1970s and traffic declined at Broad Street until that station was closed on 30 June 1986 with the former No 2 electric lines being lifted soon after.

After that the track bed through the station remained overgrown and unused until the East London Line extension was opened in 2010.

The station did not re-open as part of the East London Line extension but a new station called Shoreditch High Street was constructed nearby. The line does however pass through the Shoreditch station site.

The station&#x27;s buildings on the corner of Old Street and Kingsland Road remain intact and are in use as commercial premises within which the original stairs to the platforms remain intact.

<doc id="1179405" wikidata="Q15304394" url="?curid=1179405" title="Zhao Guangyin">
<text>Zhao Guangyin (; died May 23, 925) was an official during China&#x27;s Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. He was the chancellor during Later Tang. He was a son of the Tang dynasty chancellor Zhao Yin and younger brother of the Later Liang chancellor Zhao Guangfeng and Southern Han chancellor Zhao Guangyi. (He is referred to as Zhao Guangyun (趙光允) in some subsequent historical accounts written during the Song dynasty as part of naming taboo for Song&#x27;s founding emperor Emperor Taizu of Song (Zhao Kuangyin), but because the naming taboo appeared to be largely limited to consecutive uses of the characters &quot;Kuang&quot; and &quot;Yin,&quot; other Song dynasty sources refer to him as Guangyin.)

== Background ==
It is not known when or where Zhao Guangyin was born. His father Zhao Yin served as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Yizong of Tang and Emperor Yizong&#x27;s son and successor Emperor Xizong. His two older brothers Zhao Guangfeng and Zhao Guangyi were both known for their literary talents and virtue. Zhao Guangyin himself, like they were, was known for his ability to write poems, and he passed the imperial examinations in the &quot;Jinshi&quot; class in 891, during the reign of Emperor Xizong&#x27;s brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong. He subsequently served in the Tang imperial government, reaching the post of &quot;Jiabu Langzhong&quot; (駕部郎中), a supervisory official at the ministry of rites (禮部, &quot;Libu&quot;).

== During Later Liang ==
During the time of Tang&#x27;s successor state Later Liang, Zhao Guangfeng served as a chancellor for some time. Zhao Guangyin himself was said to have served in some (unspecified) high positions. It was said that he was considered righteous and elegant in his behavior, such that his reputation drew respect even in the territory of Later Liang&#x27;s archrival to the north, Jin.

== During Later Tang ==
In 923, Later Liang was conquered by Jin&#x27;s successor state Later Tang, whose emperor Li Cunxu took over Later Liang territory. Shortly after, his officials opined that he needed additional chancellors who were familiar with the regulations of the Tang dynasty, which Later Tang viewed itself as the legitimate successor to—at that time, the only chancellors were Doulu Ge and Guo Chongtao (and Guo also served as his chief of staff). While the popular opinions at that time were that both Xue Tinggui (薛廷珪) and Li Qi were learned and appropriate candidates, Guo opined that Xue was frivolous and lacking the appropriate disposition for a chancellor, while Li Qi was prone to risky behavior. He, citing Zhao Guangyin&#x27;s reputation even in Jin, recommended Zhao, while Doulu recommended Wei Yue. Shortly after, Li Cunxu gave both Zhao and Wei the designation of &quot;Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi&quot; (同中書門下平章事), making them chancellors, and both were also given the title of &quot;Zhongshu Shilang&quot; (中書侍郎), deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, &quot;Zhongshu Sheng&quot;).

Zhao Guangyin was described to be himself also frivolous and self-important, however, compared to the more serious disposition of his brother Zhao Guangfeng. It was said that at that time, Zhao Guangfeng was not often hosting guests, but whenever Zhao Guangyin visited him, Zhao Guangyin would try to engage him in talks about politics. Zhao Guangfeng eventually put up a sign on his door, &quot;Please do not discuss the matters of the Office of Chancellors.&quot; However, it was said that because Doulu, while from a Tang aristocratic family, never served in a Tang imperial administration, Zhao Guangyin became the key decision-maker in terms of creating regulations and rites for the new dynasty, based on Tang traditions.

However, Zhao Guangyin eventually became apprehensive about his own position over a dispute with a favorite eunuch of Li Cunxu&#x27;s, Yang Xilang (楊希朗). What happened was that Yang was an adoptive grandnephew of the powerful late Tang eunuch Yang Fugong, and requested that Yang Fugong&#x27;s properties be returned to him. When Yang Xilang&#x27;s petition was given to the Office of Chancellors for discussion, Zhao stated to Guo that Yang Fugong had been involved in a rebellion and had never had his reputation restored by Tang, such that it would be inappropriate for his property to be returned. Guo, who wanted to control the power of the eunuchs, informed Li Cunxu of this. Li Cunxu told Yang to go make his case himself with Zhao. When Yang met Zhao, Yang argued forcefully that another granduncle of his, Yang Fuguang, had great accomplishments, and that Yang Fugong&#x27;s alleged crimes were the result of the machinations of the chancellor Zhang Jun, such that Yang Fugong&#x27;s reputation was effectively restored subsequently — pointing out that if that did not occur, it would not have been possible for Yang himself and his adoptive cousins to be serving as eunuch monitors. As Yang became harsh and angry in tone during the argument, Zhao became displeased at the implication that Zhao himself was unfamiliar with late-Tang events, and Zhao also became apprehensive that Yang might act against him, as a close associate of the emperor. It was said that he became so worried that he became ill. He died in summer 925, while still serving as chancellor. He was given posthumous honors.

<text>William Henry Metcalf VC, MM &amp; Bar (29 January 1894 – 8 August 1968) was an American soldier in the Canadian Army during World War I. Metcalf was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Although Metcalf was born in the United States, Metcalf is also considered Canadian since he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1914. He is one of only seven Americans to receive the Victoria Cross.

==Military service==
Metcalf is one of six Canadian soldiers to be awarded the Victoria Cross on 2 September 1918 for actions across the Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France. The other six are: Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, Claude Joseph Patrick Nunney, Cyrus Wesley Peck, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young.

He was 23 years old and a lance corporal in the 16th (Canadian Scottish) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War when he committed the following deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 2 September 1918 at Arras, France, when the right flank of the battalion was held up, Lance Corporal Metcalf rushed forward under intense machine-gun fire to a passing tank and with his signal flag walked in front of the tank directing it along the trench in a perfect hail of bullets and bombs. The machine-gun strongpoint was overcome, very heavy casualties were inflicted and a critical situation was relieved. Later, although wounded, Corporal Metcalf continued to advance until ordered to get into a shell hole and have his wounds dressed.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The citation reads:

In addition to the Victoria Cross, he was awarded the Military Medal and Bar.

<doc id="1179414" wikidata="Q4228959" url="?curid=1179414" title="William Coltman">
<text>William Harold Coltman, (17 November 1891 – 29 June 1974) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the most decorated other rank of the First World War.

==Early life==
Coltman was born at Rangemore, a village on the outskirts of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, and baptised at All Saints, Rangemore on 27 December 1891. He worked as a market gardener. He became a member of the Plymouth Brethren, and taught in the Sunday School in the village of Winshill. He volunteered for the British Army in January 1915, during the opening months of the First World War. He served in The North Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s), in the 1/6th Battalion.

==Victoria Cross==
Lance Corporal Coltman was 26 years old and a stretcher bearer, when the following deed took place in France, for which he was awarded the VC.

Coltman was invested with his Victoria Cross by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 May 1919.

==Distinguished Conduct Medal==
The first award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) was made for gallantry over a period of days in July 1917. The citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; reads:
===Bar to the DCM===
The second award of the DCM was made for conduct in September 1918, only a week before his actions that earned him the VC. The citation read:
==Military Medal==
The Military Medal (MM) is gazetted when awarded but no citation is given. Coltman was still a private at the time of this award. The award was made for rescuing a wounded officer from no man&#x27;s land in February 1917. The officer had been commanding a wiring party during a misty night. The mist cleared and the party found themselves under fire, the officer was wounded in the thigh and Coltman immediately went out to bring the man in.

===Bar to the MM===
The second award of the MM was gazetted in August 1917. This award was for conduct behind the front lines in June 1917 and covered three separate instances of gallantry in a short period in June 1917. On 6 June an ammunition dump was hit by mortar fire causing several casualties, Coltman took responsibility for removing Verey lights from the dump. The following day he took a leading role in tending men injured when the company headquarters was mortared. A little over a week later, a trench tunnel collapsed trapping a number of men. Coltman organised a rescue party to dig the trapped men out.

==Other awards==
Prior to any of his decorations Coltman was mentioned in dispatches for his work.

==Later life==

After the war, Coltman returned to Burton and took a job as a gardener with the town&#x27;s Parks Department. During the Second World War he was commissioned in the Army Cadet Force in 1943 and commanded the Burton ACF; he resigned his commission in 1951. He retired in 1963 and died at Outwoods Hospital, Burton, in 1974 at the age of 82. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mark&#x27;s parish church in Winshill with his wife Eleanor May ( Dolman).

==Legacy==

His medals, including his Victoria Cross, are on display at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum at Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire. At the museum there is a replica First World War trench named in honour of Coltman. Coltman House is the headquarters building of Defence Medical Services at Whittington Barracks. The Burton Army Cadet Force base and Army Reserve Centre is at Coltman House, Hawkins Lane, Burton.

There is a monument to Coltman at the Memorial Gardens, Lichfield Street, Burton. The Coltman VC Peace Wood is at Mill Hill Lane, Winshill. In Tunstall a road has been named in honour of Coltman.

<text>First Knight is a 1995 medieval historical drama film based on Arthurian legend, directed by Jerry Zucker. It stars Sean Connery as King Arthur, Richard Gere as Lancelot, Julia Ormond as Guinevere and Ben Cross as Malagant.

The film follows the rogue Lancelot&#x27;s romance with Lady Guinevere of Leonesse, who is to marry King Arthur of Camelot, while the land is threatened by the renegade knight Malagant. The film is noteworthy within Arthurian cinema for its absence of magical elements, its drawing on the material of Chrétien de Troyes for plot elements and the substantial age difference between Arthur and Guinevere.

==Plot==
King Arthur of Camelot, victorious from his wars, has dedicated his reign to promoting justice and peace and now wishes to marry. However, Malagant, a former Knight of the Round Table, desires the throne for himself.

Lancelot, a vagabond and skilled swordsman, duels in small villages for money. He attributes his skill to his lack of concern whether he lives or dies. Guinevere the young ruler of Lyonesse, decides to marry King Arthur out of admiration and for security against Malagant, who has been raiding local villages under the guise of &quot;upholding the law.&quot;

While traveling, Lancelot chances by Guinevere&#x27;s carriage on the way to Camelot, and spoils Malagant&#x27;s ambush meant to kidnap her. He falls in love with her, but she refuses his advances. Though Lancelot urges Guinevere to follow her heart, she remains bound by duty. She is subsequently reunited with her escort.

Later, Lancelot arrives in Camelot and successfully navigates an obstacle course on the prospect of a kiss from Guinevere, though he instead kisses her hand. He also wins an audience with her husband-to-be, Arthur. Impressed by his courage and struck by his recklessness and freewheeling, he shows him the Round Table, symbolizing a life of service and brotherhood, and warns him that a man &quot;who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing&quot;.

That night, Malagant&#x27;s henchmen arrive at Camelot and kidnap Guinevere. She is tied up and carried off to his headquarters, where she is held hostage. Lancelot follows, posing as a messenger from Camelot. He requests to see Guinevere alive before he delivers the message, then overpowers the guards and escapes with her. Once again, Lancelot tries to win her heart, but is unsuccessful. On the return journey, it is revealed that he was orphaned and rendered homeless after bandits attacked his village, and has been wandering ever since.

In gratitude, Arthur offers Lancelot a higher calling in life as a Knight of the Round Table. Amidst the protests of the other Knights (who are suspicious of his station) and of Guinevere (who struggles with her feelings for him) he accepts and takes Malagant&#x27;s place at the Table, saying he has found something to care about.

Arthur and Guinevere subsequently wed. However, a messenger from Lyonesse arrives, with news that Malagant has invaded. Arthur leads his troops to Lyonesse and successfully defeats Malagant&#x27;s forces. Lancelot wins the respect of the other Knights with his prowess in battle. He also learns to embrace Arthur&#x27;s philosophy, moved by the plight of villagers.

Lancelot, guilty about his feelings for the queen and loyalty to Arthur, privately announces his departure to her. Not able to bear the thought of his leaving, she finally asks him for a kiss. It turns into a passionate embrace, just in time for the king to interrupt. Though Guinevere loves both Arthur and Lancelot – albeit in different ways – they are charged with treason. The open trial in the great square of Camelot is interrupted by a surprise invasion by Malagant, ready to burn Camelot and kill Arthur if he does not swear fealty.

Instead Arthur commands his subjects to fight, and Malagant&#x27;s men shoot him with crossbows. A battle ensues, and Lancelot and Malagant face off. Disarmed, Lancelot seizes Arthur&#x27;s fallen sword and kills Malagant, who falls dead on that same throne he so desired. The people of Camelot win the battle, but Arthur dies of his wounds.

On his deathbed, he names Lancelot his successor and asks him to &quot;take care of her for me&quot; – referring to both Camelot and Guinevere. The film closes with a funeral pyre raft carrying Arthur&#x27;s body floating out to sea.

==Cast==

==Production==
Director Jerry Zucker, who also co-produced with Hunt Lowry, made &quot;First Knight&quot; as a follow-up to his Academy Award-nominated 1990 hit &quot;Ghost&quot;. Previously, he was primarily known for teaming with his brother David Zucker and with Jim Abrahams to create comedies such as &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;.

The script was written by William Nicholson. Adam Greenberg was in charge of cinematography, while production design was under John Box. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The film was edited and mixed by Walter Murch.

===Locations===
Filming was shot on location in Great Britain. Exteriors were done in Gwynedd, North Wales and in England around Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, with the wedding scene being shot at St Albans Cathedral. Interiors were completed at Pinewood Studios.

==Music==
The critically acclaimed orchestral score for &quot;First Knight&quot; was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith was hired as a last-minute replacement to other noteworthy film score veteran Maurice Jarre, who was hired to score the original three-hour cut, but as Jarre stated in a 1995 &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; interview, he had four weeks to do 90 minutes and that was not enough time and declined the offer to score the film. As a result, Goldsmith had limited time to compose original music and was left with only three and a half days to record the entire score. A soundtrack was released 4 July 1995 through Epic Soundtrax and features ten tracks of score at a running time of forty minutes. Due to the shortness of the original release, bootleg versions began to appear in 2000. However, limited edition 2-CD (5,000 copies) soundtrack was released April 12, 2011 through La-La Land Records and features the complete score plus the original album tracks and additional alternate recordings.

==Box office and reception==
The film earned a domestic gross of $37,600,435 and $90,000,000 in foreign markets; overall, earning a combined take of $127,600,435 worldwide. It opened third in the United States with an opening weekend gross of $10,856,442 from 2,161 theaters behind &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and fellow opener &quot;Species&quot;. It opened in the United Kingdom on the same day on 368 screens and was number one for the week with a gross of $2,451,612.

Based on reviews, &quot;First Knight&quot; is rated at at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;This unimaginative reimagining of Arthurian legend dispenses with the magic without achieving a convincing realism in the bargain, suffering from fatal miscasting and a lack of romance.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two stars in his review, citing Connery and his performance along with the sets but stating that it paled in comparison to other medieval films released the same year such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot; (with &quot;First Knight&quot; coming out two months after the latter film), calling it &quot;thin and unconvincing&quot; compared to the other two, while also describing Gere as one who &quot;plays Lancelot with such insouciance that he doesn&#x27;t seem serious enough to love. He doesn&#x27;t have the psychic weight to be worth a kingdom.&quot;

<doc id="1179420" wikidata="Q5723874" url="?curid=1179420" title="Henry Raby">
<text>Rear-Admiral Henry James Raby (26 September 1827 – 13 February 1907) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Henry James Raby was born at Boulogne, France on 26 September 1827, the son of Mr A.T. Raby of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales. He attended Sherborne School from 1841 to 1842, during which time he was a member of Abbey House.

After leaving Sherborne School, he entered the Royal Navy in 1842 as a 1st Class Volunteer in H.M.S. &quot;Monarch&quot;. He served for 11 months with the Naval Brigade in the Crimea being promoted Commander for his services.

==VC action==
Raby was 27 years old, and a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy serving with the Naval Brigade during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 June 1855 in the Crimea, immediately after the assault on Sebastopol, a soldier of the 57th Regiment, who had been wounded in both legs, was observed sitting up and calling for help. At once Lieutenant Raby and seamen Henry Curtis and John Taylor left the shelter of their battery works and ran forward a distance of 70 yards, across open ground, through heavy gunfire and succeeded in carrying the wounded man to safety.

Raby was the first man to receive the Victoria Cross from Queen Victoria at the first investiture on 26 June 1857. The Queen pinned the crosses on the recipients in strict order of service precedence and seniority. Commander Raby therefore came first as the senior officer in the senior service on parade, although his VC deed had been performed after that of the midshipman, Lucas, who certainly stands as the first to be granted the award of the cross. Similarly in the army contingent, Sergeant-Major Grieve was the first soldier on the parade to receive the cross, because he belonged to the Cavalry, an arm senior to the Infantry, although his VC deed was later than those of the four infantry soldiers who earned it at the Alma.

==Subsequent career and death==
In command of H.M.S. &quot;Medusa&quot; and later of H.M.S. &quot;Alecto&quot; in the 1860s, he played a prominent part in the suppression of the slave trade on the West Coast of Africa and was present at the attack and destruction of Porto Novo in Dahomey. He was promoted Captain for his services in 1862. He was awarded C.B. in 1875 and commanded H.M.S. &quot;Aventure&quot; on the China Station 1868–1871. He retired as a Rear Admiral 1878, and devoted the remaining years of his life to service charities.

Raby died at his home in Southsea on 13 February 1907.
Raby&#x27;s obituary appeared in &quot;The Shirburnian&quot; in March 1907 [Reprint from &quot;The Times&quot;, 14 February 1907]: 
==The medal==
His medal is on display at the Royal Naval Museum in Portsmouth.

<text>A memory buffer register (MBR) or memory data register (MDR) is the register in a computer&#x27;s CPU that stores the data being transferred to and from the immediate access storage. It was first implemented in von Neumann model. It contains a copy of the value in the memory location specified by the memory address register. It acts as a buffer, allowing the processor and memory units to act independently without being affected by minor differences in operation. A data item will be copied to the MBR ready for use at the next clock cycle, when it can be either used by the processor for reading or writing, or stored in main memory after being written.

This register holds the contents of the memory which are to be transferred from memory to other components or vice versa. A word to be stored must be transferred to the MBR, from where it goes to the specific memory location, and the arithmetic data to be processed in the ALU first goes to MBR and then to accumulator register, before being processed in the ALU.

The MDR is a &quot;two-way register.&quot; When data is fetched from memory and placed into the MDR, it is written to go in one direction. When there is a write instruction, the data to be written is placed into the MDR from another CPU register, which then puts the data into memory.

The memory data register is half of a minimal interface between a microprogram and computer storage; the other half is a memory address register (MAR).

During the read/write phase, the Control Unit generates control signals that direct the memory controller to fetch or store data.

<text>Brigadier-General Roland Boys Bradford, VC, MC (23 February 1892 – 30 November 1917) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His elder brother, Lieutenant Commander George Bradford, was also awarded the Victoria Cross, making them the only pair of brothers to be awarded the medal during the First World War.

==Early life==
Bradford was born on 23 February 1892 at Witton Park, County Durham, to George Bradford. and educated at Epsom College in Surrey. He had three brothers, James Barker, Thomas Andrews and George Nicholson, of which he was the youngest &quot;and by far the liveliest, endowed with an excellent mind and an ebullient sense of fun&quot;.

==Military service==
Bradford was commissioned into the 5th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (a Territorial Force unit) in 1910. He transferred to the Regular Army in 1912, joining his regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion with the rank of second lieutenant. He was a lieutenant by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He was awarded the Military Cross in February 1915.

On 1 October 1916, Bradford, now a temporary lieutenant colonel commanding the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Eaucourt L&#x27;Abbaye, France. His citation for the award was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 25 November, reading:

===Promotion and death===
On 13 November 1917, at the age of 25, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general; he was the youngest general officer in the British Army of modern times (and the youngest promoted professionally, earlier young generals were simply due to position). He was killed &quot;by a stray German shell&quot; at Cambrai, France, seventeen days later, on 30 November 1917.

All three of Bradford&#x27;s brothers also served in the First World War. Two, Lieutenant Commander George Bradford of the Royal Navy and Second Lieutenant James Barker Bradford, also of the Durham Light Infantry, died in service. George and Roland were the only pair of brothers to win the VC in the First World War. His third brother, Colonel Sir Thomas Bradford, became honorary treasurer of Durham University and High Sheriff of County Durham in 1941.

==Legacy==
Bradford&#x27;s VC and Military Cross are currently on loan to the University of Durham and are held at Palace Green Library adjacent to Durham Cathedral in Durham, England. Medals are not on display, but members of the public are able to consult individual medals or groups of medals from the collection in the Barker Research Library within Palace Green Library.

A memorial garden and statue to Bradford was unveiled in 2017. The British government commemorated the centenary of the First World War by installing an inscribed stone at the recipient&#x27;s birthplace. Local councillors from Bradford&#x27;s birthplace at Witton Park decided to use this occasion to create a memorial garden at the site with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Groundwork North-East and Durham County Council. A metal statue by Ray Lonsdale called &quot;The Ball&quot; was installed as part of the memorial garden. This depicts a soldier returning home from the front together with a pitman who is comforting him and passing a football to him representing giving him back his old life before the war.

As he established his career as a stage actor, he adopted Franz Kafka&#x27;s short story &quot;A Report to an Academy&quot; in 1977 into a mono drama titled &quot;Confession of Red Peter&quot; (). Chu took charge of planning, production, stage directing, acting, and makeups. The play was opened at the &quot;3.1 ro Storage Theatre&quot; on August 20, 1977. The drama became a huge hit at that time and attracted 60,000 audiences in the four months, setting the record of the highest audience. The play was a critical starter for booming mono drama in South Korea. In 1980, Chu opened a small theatre named &quot;Salon Theatre Chu&quot; where a Western-style restaurant was housed as well.

Chu won the Best Actor at Dong-A Theatre Awards two times for his acting for &quot;Eodiseo mueoti doeeo mannarya&quot; () in 1971 and () in 1973.
