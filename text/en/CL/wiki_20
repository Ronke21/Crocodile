<text>The Duenos inscription is one of the earliest known Old Latin texts, variously dated from the 7th to the 5th century BC. It is inscribed on the sides of a &quot;kernos&quot;, in this case a trio of small globular vases adjoined by three clay struts. It was found by Heinrich Dressel in 1880 in the valley between Quirinale and Viminale (today Via Nazionale)
in Rome. The &quot;kernos&quot; is part of the collection of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin (inventory no. 30894,3).

The inscription is written right to left in three units, without spaces to separate words. It is difficult to translate, as some letters are hard to distinguish, particularly since they cannot always be deduced by context. The absence of spaces causes additional difficulty in assigning the letters to the respective words.

==Text and translations==

There have been many proposed translations advanced by scholars since the discovery of the &quot;kernos&quot;; by 1983, more than 50 different explanations of the meaning had been put forward. Due to the lack of a large body of archaic Latin, and the method by which Romans abbreviated their inscriptions, scholars have not been able to produce a single translation that has been accepted by historians as accurate.

Below is the transcription and one of many possible interpretations:
:a. The direct unicase transcription
:b. Direct transcription, in lowercase, with possible macrons and word breaks
:c. A speculative interpretation and translation into Classical Latin
:d. An English gloss (approximate translation/interpretation) of the Classical Latin rendering

Line 1:
:a. 
:b. &quot;iouesāt deivos qoi mēd mitāt, nei tēd endō cosmis vircō siēd&quot;
:c. &quot;Jūrat deōs quī mē mittit, nī [ergā tē] comis virgō sit&quot;
:d. &#x27;The person who sends me prays to the gods, lest the girl be not kind towards thee&#x27;

Line 2:
:a. 
:b. &quot;as(t) tēd noisi o(p)petoit esiāi pākā riuois&quot;
:c. &quot;at tē&quot; [... uncertain ...] &quot;pācā rīvīs&quot;
:d. &#x27;without thee [...] calm with [these] rivers&#x27;

Line 3:
:a. 
:b. &quot;duenos mēd fēced en mānōm (m)einom duenōi nē mēd malo(s) statōd&quot;
:c. &quot;Bonus mē fēcit in manum [...] bonō, nē mē malus [clepitō]&quot;
:d. &#x27;A good man made me (in good intention?) for a good man; may I not be stolen by an evil man.&#x27;

An interpretation set out by Warmington and Eichner, renders the complete translation as follows, though not with certainty:
#It is sworn with the gods, whence I&#x27;m issued:If a maiden does not smile at you,
#nor is strongly attracted to you,then soothe her with this fragrance!
#Someone good has filled me for someone good and well-mannered,and not shall I be obtained by someone bad.

===Notes===
&quot;Duenos&quot; is an older form of Classical Latin (&#x27;good&#x27;), just as Classical (&#x27;war&#x27;) is from Old Latin &quot;duellum&quot;. Some scholars posit Duenos as a proper name, instead of merely an adjective.

==Epigraphic note==
The inscription (CIL I 2nd 2, 4) is scratched along the side of the body of three vases made of dark brown &quot;bucchero&quot;, connected with each other by short cylindric arms. It is written from right to left spiralling downwards about times. The letters are written upside-down for a reader who looks at the inscription from a level position; this has been explained by Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi as due to the fact that the inscription was meant to be read from above, not from a sideways position. Some letters are written in an archaic fashion that appears influenced by the Greek alphabet. There are signs of corrections in the two or of and and in the of . Three distinct sections are individuated by spaces after and . There are neither spaces delimiting words nor signs of interpunction. The earliest interpunction to appear was syllabic. As it appeared only in the 7th century BC, the inscription should be more ancient.

The inscription is made up by two distinct parts or sections, the second one beginning with the word . It was found in a &quot;favissa&quot; (votive deposit). It belongs to the kind known as &quot;speaking inscriptions&quot;, widely in use in the Archaic period. Some scholars consider the object to be of good quality and reflecting the high social status of the owner. Others consider it common.

==Site of the find==
The vase was bought from an antiquarian by Heinrich Dressel shortly after its find. It was discovered in 1880 by workers who were digging to lay the foundation of a building near the newly opened Via Nazionale, in the valley between the Quirinal Hill and the Viminal Hill. More precisely it was found on the south slope of the Quirinal, near the church of San Vitale, Rome. Dressel was told the place was supposed to have been a burial site.

Archaeologist Filippo Coarelli has advanced the hypothesis that the object might have been placed in the votive deposit of one of the temples of goddess Fortuna dedicated by king Servius Tullius, perhaps the one known as &quot;Fortuna Publica&quot; or &quot; Citerior&quot;, i.e. located on the side of the Quirinal near to Rome. Her festival recurred on the &quot;nonae&quot; of April (April 5). However, June 11, the festival day of the Matralia, which was originally devoted to &quot;Mater Matuta&quot;, was also the day of the &quot;Fortuna Virgo&quot;, ritually associated with the passage of girls from adolescence into adulthood and married life.

For another scholar, the site of the find was in Trastevere but near the valley between the Viminale and Quirinale.

==Overview of the linguistic research==
The antiquity of the document is generally acknowledged. The language shows archaic characters in morphology, phonetics and syntax. The absence of &quot;u&quot; after &quot;q&quot; would testify to its greater antiquity comparatively to the inscription of the &quot;cippus&quot; of the Forum, also known as Lapis Niger (CIL I 1).

===First section===
For the sake of convenience of interpretation, the text is usually divided into two sections, the first one containing the first two units and ending with . The two sections show a relative syntactic and semantic independence.

Many attempts have been made at deciphering the text.

In the 1950s the inscription had been interpreted mainly on the basis of (and in relation to) the supposed function of the vases, considered either as containers for a love philter or of beauty products: the text would then mockingly threaten the owner about his behaviour towards the vase itself or try to attract a potential buyer. This is the so-called erotic line of interpretation which found supporters until the 1980s.

During the 1960s Georges Dumézil proposed a new line of thought in the interpreting of the text. He remarked the inconsistency of the previous interpretations both with the solemnity of the opening formula (&quot;Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat&quot;: &#x27;He swears for the gods who sends /delivers me&#x27;) and with the site of the find. Dumézil&#x27;s interpretation was: &quot;If it happens that the girl is not nice to you/ has no easy relationship with you (&quot;&quot;nei ted endo cosmis virco sied&quot; = &quot;ne in te (=erga te) comis virgo sit&quot;), we shall have the obligation of bringing her and you into good harmony, accord, agreement (&quot;asted noisi ... pakari vois&quot;=&quot;at sit nobis ... pacari vobis&quot;&quot;). The transmission of the object would be expressed by the words &quot;qoi med mitat&quot;. The story mirrored in the text would thus depict a custom deeply rooted in Roman society that is described by Plautus in the scene of the Menaechmi in which the &quot;tutor&quot; of the &quot;virgo&quot; or his representatives formally give a suretyship about her attitude towards a man.

Dumézil&#x27;s interpretation though was fraught with linguistic problems. Apart from the value of the before , which he considered meaningless or an error of the incisor, the only possible meaning of &quot;ope&quot; in Latin is &#x27;by the power or force of&#x27;, and it governs a word in the genitive case. Thence the only governing word could be the group : this would then be an exception to the rule of the genitive of the themes in &quot;-a&quot;, which does not end in &quot;-as&quot; as expected, an archaism perhaps in Dumézil&#x27;s view. would then denote the means by which the &quot;nois(i)&quot;, &#x27;we&#x27;, would have the authority of establishing peace between the &#x27;vois&#x27; &#x27;you&#x27; (the couple) of the main relationship justifying the delivery of the vase. Dumézil thinks of the involvement of more than one &quot;tutor&quot; for each party in order to explain the two plurals &quot;nois(i)&quot; and &quot;vois&quot;. Lastly the ending presents difficulties. It might derive from an archaic &quot;-e-s-la&quot; as proposed by H. Osthoff in the formation of Latin abstract names with an assimilation of the liquid into an &quot;i&quot;. Another possibility would be to interpret the suffix &quot;-ela&quot; as &quot;-e-la&quot;, i.e. as a female derivation of an ancient neuter &quot;-el&quot; attested in Hittite. This would entail admitting the incisor made two errors.

Antonino Pagliaro understood the word as an adjective from noun &quot;tutela&quot;, &quot;ope tuteria&quot;, i.e. &quot;ope tutoria&quot; in classical Latin: the word would thence be an attribute in the ablative.

Dumézil&#x27;s contribution and the location of the find gave researchers grounds to pursue their work of interpretation in the same direction, i.e. of its significance as a token of legal obligation. The efforts have centred on deciphering of the last segment of the first section, .

As already mentioned above, the cult of &quot;Fortuna Virgo&quot;, celebrated on the day of the Matralia, was related to the role of girls who became married women. The passage saw girls as completely passive subjects both during the archaic period and great part of the republican: the matrimonial exchange was conducted, as far as legally relevant profiles were concerned, by the subjects who had &quot;potestas&quot; on the woman and by the future husband (or he/those who had &quot;potestas&quot; over him). This is testified by the fact the &quot;virgo&quot; had no right of pronouncing the &quot;nupta verba&quot;.

The passage which presents the greatest difficulties is the central group of letters in the string . Proposed interpretations include: &quot;iubet&quot; orders for ; &quot;futuitioni&quot; sexual intercourse for , the cut / or / so that would be the only recognisable Latin word.

Dumézil attributes a peculiar semantic value to the syllabic group : a moral instrument that is nothing else than a form of the power the males of a family group (father, tutors) exercised on a girl, i.e. a variant or alteration of the word &quot;tutelae&quot;, similar to &quot;tu(i)tela&quot;. Since this interpretation has been proposed no critic has been able to disprove it. Authoritative scholars on the grounds of the lexeme &quot;toitesiai&quot; have proposed a theonym (Coarelli), a feminine proper name Tuteria (Peruzzi, Bolelli), or even a &quot;gentilicium&quot;, the gens Titur(n)ia (Simon and Elboj) mentioned by Cicero.

In the 1990s, two further contributions have discussed once again the interpretation of the second part of the first grapheme, particularly morpheme &quot;toitesiai&quot;. Even though doubts have been cast over its correspondence with the technical Roman legal word &quot;tutela&quot;, Dumézil&#x27;s intuition of recognising in the destination of the vase a juridical function, namely a matrimonial &quot;sponsio&quot;, was accepted and taken on.

G. Pennisi reconstructs the text as follows: &quot;Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat: nei ted cosmis virgo sied ast ednoisi opetoi pakari vois. Duenos med feced en manom einom duenoi ne med malos tatod&quot;. Segment is deciphered recurring to Homeric έεδνα in the meaning of nuptial gifts and the speaking token would be a marriage compact or promise by a young man in love to a girl to whom the vase is presented as a gift. The inscription would thence exhibit an oath structure consisting in an archaic form of &quot;coemptio&quot;: &quot;Swears for the gods he who buys me&quot;: &quot;mitat = *emitat&quot; (the future bridegroom would be speaking in the third person). Then passing to the second person the compact would be set out in the second line by the offering of the nuptial gifts as a guarantee. The third line would complete the legal formula of the compact (&quot;Duenos / ne med malos tatod&quot;).
Leo Peppe has proposed to interpret the inscription as a primitive form of matrimonial &quot;coemptio&quot; different from that presented in Gaius, consisting in a cumulative acceptance that included both the legal aspects concerning the transmission of the dotal assets and the religious ones inherent in the matrimonial cults and rites.

F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj (autopsy) confirmed the interpretation of the previous proposals that see in the vase the symbol of a marriage compact. The authors ground their interpretation on the segment instead of . They therefore identified a root &quot;*o-it&quot; (composed by prefix &quot;*o&quot; and lexeme &quot;*i-&quot;, cf. Latin &quot;eo&quot;) related to classic Latin &quot;utor&quot;, and suffix &quot;-esios/a&quot; (cf. &quot;Valesios&quot; of the Lapis Satricanus and &quot;Leucesie&quot; of the carmen Saliare). The substantive &quot;oitesiai&quot; would be thus related to the semantic field of &quot;utor&quot; i.e. the concept of &quot;utilitas&quot;. Therefore, the text should be divided as: &quot;asted noisi; opet otesiai pakari vois&quot;. &quot;Opet&quot; would be an articulatory fusion between the dative &quot;opi&quot; and conjunction &quot;et&quot;. The whole text should thus be understood as: &quot;Ni erga te virgo comis sit, asted nobis; (iurat) opi et utilitati pangi vois&quot;, &#x27;if the girl is not to your taste/agreeable to you, let her go back to us; (he swears) to give you guarantee about your disturb and your interest&#x27;. The segment &quot;oitesiai&quot; could be also understood as &quot;utensilium&quot; referred to the vase itself as a token of suretyship or &quot;usus&quot; in the technical legal sense of Roman marriage as a way of providing a guarantee. The last two hypotheses are, however, considered unacceptable by the authors on the grounds that no genitive marker is to be found in the segment &quot;oitesiai&quot;.
The proposed interpretation would find support in its strict analogy with a passage of Terentius&#x27;s Hecyra (vv. 136–151), in which a story similar to that supposedly recorded on the vase is described. The text would thus be the undertaking of an obligation concerning the eventuality that the girl go back to her family of origin, should she be not liked by the bridegroom (&quot;asted endo cosmis virco sied, asted noisi&quot;).

Even after the last two contributions related above, Sacchi acknowledges that all attempts at interpreting the segment remain conjectural.

Dumézil&#x27;s hypothesis of a protoform of &quot;tutela&quot;, though attractive and plausible, remains unconfirmed.

===Juridical note on the matrimonial &quot;sponsio&quot;===
Although there are still obscure points in the interpretation of line two, it is generally accepted that the text contains the formula of an oath. On the archaic oath and its juridical value there is large agreement among scholars. It looks also probable that the object should have a religious implication: an instrument permeated by religious ritualism, as the oath could well be employed in legal practice at the time of the object, as seems supported by linguistic analysis. The usage of the oath in archaic times as an instrument of private civil law could have been widespread, even though the issue has not yet been thoroughly analysed. Even though in the inscription there is no segment directly reminiscent of the dialogic formula of the &quot;sponsio&quot;, i.e. &quot;&quot;spondes tu ...?&quot;, &quot;spondeo!&quot;&quot;, internal and external evidence allow the assumption of the enactment of a matrimonial &quot;sponsio&quot;. Such a usage of oaths is attested in later literary sources.

Besides the trace of a &quot;sponsio&quot; as the legal function of the object, Dumézil would also see that of providing a piece evidence, i.e. a probatory attitude. Servius in his commentary to the &quot;Aeneid&quot; writes that, before the introduction of the matrimonial tablets, in Latium the parties used to exchange tokens of pledge (&quot;symbola&quot;) on which they stated as a promise that they agreed to the marriage and nominated guarantors (&quot;sponsores&quot;). To the same time of the regal period is ascribed the introduction of the Greek use of double scriptures, &quot;tesserae&quot;.

The sponsio is one of the most ancient forms of verbal undertaking of obligation and its religious nature is acknowledged, as well as its connection with betrothal. The ancient sources are in agreement that the archaic &quot;sponsalia&quot; had a religious nature.

Brent Vine&#x27;s study which focuses on the linguistic analysis of the word of the first sentence and of the segment of the third lends support to such an interpretation: he argues that &quot;mitat&quot; would be a form of a frequentative verb &quot;mitare&quot; based on a past participle in -&quot;to&quot; of an IE root &quot;*meɨ̯&quot;, with the meaning of &#x27;exchange&#x27;. Semantically this frequentative should be considered factitive, thence arriving at a verb that would mean &#x27;to cause to be given in exchange&#x27;, hence &#x27;to give (in exchange)&#x27;. Vine&#x27;s analysis of the segment fits the hypothesis of an exchange of &quot;symbola&quot; equally well. He argues that a word could be isolated on the grounds of the single spelling of geminates which is considered normal by linguists for the archaic period. This he proposes to understand as reflecting a substantivised &quot;*méi̯-no-&quot;, meaning &#x27;something given in exchange, gift&#x27; from the same root &quot;*mei̯ &quot; as in . This form would be a -&quot;no&quot; substantive, a widely attested formation and may be presupposed by Latin &quot;mūnus, mūneris&quot; &#x27;duty, service, office, offering&#x27;, from immediate antecedent &quot;*mói̯-n-es-&quot;. The appearance of &quot;mitat&quot; and &quot;[m]einom&quot; show a semantic contiguity and may constitute a figura etymologica. This alliterative form would be analogous to the Old Latin phrase &quot;donum do&quot;, &quot;donum&quot; being formed exactly in the same way as supposed for &quot;[m]einom&quot; (&quot;*déh3-no-&quot;). &quot;*Meinom mito&quot; would have existed beside &quot;donum do&quot;, both referring to similar but culturally distinct behaviours, the first one perhaps &quot;specifically involving exchange/reciprocity&quot;.

The document raises also the question of the kind of the marriage in question, and specifically of whether it was with or without &quot;manus&quot;. Dumézil supported the thesis of a marriage without loss the independent status of the woman (&quot;sine capitis deminutio&quot;). In the last case it should be admitted that in archaic times a form of marriage existed in which the &quot;sponsio&quot; was directly linked to the &quot;nuptiae&quot;, independently from the initial constitution of the &quot;manus&quot;. The &quot;sponsalia&quot; would then be the occasion upon which the legal subjects defined the compacts concerning the juridical and economic aspects of the marriage: the dowry, the future legal status of the woman who could be put under the &quot;potestas/tutela&quot; of one or more persons, the compensations for a passage of status of the woman and the guarantees for breach of promise. Two strata were perhaps present as testified by the expression &quot;more atque iure&quot; of Gellius.

Then the object in question could well have been deposited in a temple upon the occasion of a marriage ritual as a probatory document of an engagement undertaken not by the girl but by her &quot;sponsor&quot;. The compact would be also a legal guarantee of the rights of the future bridegroom.

===The second section===

The most relevant issue for the interpretation of the document in Sacchi&#x27;s view is the meaning the lexical couple . The meaning of &quot;Duenos&quot; has been often considered to be the name of the craftsman who made the object. Such an interpretation meets with the difficulty of how to explain the second occurrence of the word and with the problem of how to interpret , since if &quot;Duenos&quot; is a name identifying a person and qualifying him as &#x27;good&#x27; then it would be difficult to understand the use of &quot;manom&quot; in the same sense of &#x27;good&#x27;. It should be easier to understand &quot;manom&quot; as &quot;manum&quot; (&#x27;hand&#x27;), i.e. reading: &quot;Duenos made me with his own hands&quot;.

Sacchi, following Palmer and Colonna, proposes to interpret the couple as conveying a specifically technical religious and legal meaning as is testified in ancient sources. &quot;Duenos&quot; has given classic Latin &quot;bonus&quot;, &#x27;good&#x27;, but originally the adjective had certainly religious and sacral implications: in the oldest sacral formulae it had a more technical acception and the repetition had other implications than just eurythmy. Colonna refers to the formula &quot;optumus duonorum&quot; of the mid republic which was a qualificative formula with sacral implication reserved to the upper classes. Correspondences are the opposition of the epithets &quot;Optimus&quot; and &quot;Maximus&quot; of Capitoline Jupiter, the early Faliscan &quot;Titia&quot; inscription &quot;Eco quton euotenosio titias duenom duenas. Salu[...]voltene&quot; interpreted as &#x27;good among the good&#x27;, the epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the consul of 259 BC, &quot;duonoro[m] optumo[m]... viro[m]&quot; in which clearly the adjective &quot;duonus&quot; is not the synonym of &quot;optumus&quot;, that as derived from &quot;ops&quot;, plenty, has different semantic connotations. Colonna also reminds that &quot;in the Carmen Saliare (similarly to the Duenos vase) &quot;bonus&quot; (&quot;duonus&quot;) and &quot;manus&quot; occur together, both referred to the same character, the god &quot;Cerus&quot;, fact that makes their synonymity implausible&quot;. In order to further clarify the use of the adjective in the text, Sacchi makes reference also to a well-known passage of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Legibus&quot; II 9, 22: &quot;Deorum Manium iura sancta sunto. (B)onos leto datos divos habento ...&quot;. Here too as in the above two instances &quot;one can remark the opposition between &quot;Manium&quot;, that, as shown in Paulus exc. Festi, originally meant &#x27;the good ones&#x27; and the qualificative (B)onos = Duenos as referred to the deified dead (= &quot;divos&quot;). Cicero here relates a pontifical prescription of high antiquity consciously preserving the original wise of expression and lexic&quot;. In other words, one could argue that it is not meant that the &quot;dii Manes&quot; become &#x27;good&#x27; in the ethic sense, but rather that the dead consecrated to death according to the pontifical prescriptions (&quot;leto datos&quot;) do become gods (= &quot;divos&quot;). The epithet &quot;duenos&quot; would then design that which has been given in homage, consecrated correctly according to the pontifical ritual.

Sacchi opines that in the case of the Duenos inscription the speaker is acting according to the religious legal ritual, presumably enacting a private &quot;consecratio&quot;: the formula of the dedication is then a case of private &quot;dedicatio dis&quot;, dedication to the gods. The epithet &quot;duenos&quot; should therefore be interpreted as used in its original technical sense. The restitution of the text should thus be: &quot;A party acting in the way sanctioned by religious law made/consecrated me for a good end. That no harm/fraud be done to me and to one who is a party (equally) religiously sanctioned by the gods&quot;. The vase is a speaking token that after the celebration of the ritual consecrates the content of the action, of which it is &quot;the form in its probatory function and the matter as a constituent element&quot;.

Vine quotes German authors who still follow the erotic thread of interpretation. They think of the vase as a container for beauty products and interpret the last phrase as &#x27;let no evil person steal me&#x27;. &quot; would be a form of a Latin verb &quot;*stare&quot; that failed to survive for its &quot;homonymie fâcheuse&quot; [unfortunate homonymy] with the ordinary verb for &#x27;stand, as found in Hittite &quot;tāyezzi&quot; &#x27;steals&#x27;, Vedic &quot;stená-stāyú&quot; &#x27;thief&#x27;.

Both Sacchi and Vine remark the striking parallelism between the formula of the Duenos inscription: and the inscription on a pedestal (probably of a votive statue) from Tibur: . Vine finds in it support for his interpreting of as meaning &quot;munus&quot;.

===Cosmis===
Sacchi rejects the interpretation of &quot;cosmis&quot; as &quot;agreeable&quot; in the first section that is traditionally accepted in the scholarly literature, on the grounds of considerations of history of the language and semantics. He proposes to interpret the term as referring to the peculiar style of hairdressing of brides, known as &quot;seni crines&quot; which would find support in Festus: &quot;&quot;Comptus id est ornatus ... qui apud nos comis: et comae dicuntur capilli cum aliqua cura compositi&quot;, &#x27;&quot;Comptus&quot;, that is adorned, ... what we call &quot;comis&quot;; and &quot;comae&quot; is named the hair dressed with a certain care&#x27;. In the inscription the use of this word would be an explicit allusion to the fact that the girl shall be ready to marry. Festus gives it as a most ancient custom for marriage ceremonies. An analogous usage of the word &quot;comis&quot; is to be found in Gellius while relating the custom of &quot;flaminica dialis&quot; on the occasion of the Argei.

==Earlier specimens of Old Latin==
The Praenestine fibula is generally thought to be the earliest surviving evidence of the Latin language. The Lapis Niger inscription is another example of Old Latin dated to the period of Rome&#x27;s monarchy, although scholars have had difficulty in their attempts to interpret the meaning of the texts in their surviving fragments.

<text>Prison reform is the attempt to improve conditions inside prisons, improve the effectiveness of a penal system, reduce recidivism or implement alternatives to incarceration. It also focuses on ensuring the reinstatement of those whose lives are impacted by crimes.

In modern times, the idea of making living spaces safe and clean has extended from the civilian population to include prisons, based on ethical grounds. It is recognized that unsafe and unsanitary prisons violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. In recent times prison reform ideas include greater access to legal counsel and family, conjugal visits, proactive security against violence, and implementing house arrest with assistive technology.

==History==

Prisons have only been used as the primary punishment for criminal acts in the last few centuries. Far more common earlier were various types of corporal punishment, public humiliation, penal bondage, and banishment for more severe offenses, as well as capital punishment, all of which occur today.

The concept of incarceration was presented circa 1750 as a more humane form of punishment than the corporal and capital punishment. They were originally designed as a way for criminals to participate in religious self-reflection and self-reform as a form of penance, hence the term penitentiary.

Prisons contained both felons and debtors—the latter of which were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was rife with corruption. One reform of the sixteenth century was the establishment of the &quot;London Bridewell&quot; as a house of correction for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided.

===Europe===
====Continental countries====
The first public prison in Europe was &quot;Le Stinche&quot; in Florence, constructed in 1297, copied in several other cities. The more modern use grew from the prison workhouse (known as the Rasphuis) from 1600 in Holland. The house was normally managed by a married couple, the &#x27;father&#x27; and &#x27;mother&#x27;, usually with a work master and discipline master. The inmates, or journeymen, often spent their time on spinning, weaving and fabricating cloths and their output was measured and those who exceeded the minimum received a small sum of money with which they could buy extras from the indoor father.

An exception to the rule of forced labor were those inmates whose families could not look after them and paid for them to be in the workhouse. From the later 17th century private institutions for the insane, called the &quot;beterhuis&quot;, developed to meet this need.

In Hamburg, a different pattern occurred with the &quot;spinhaus&quot; in 1669, to which only infamous criminals were admitted. This was paid by the public treasury and the pattern spread in eighteenth-century Germany. In France the use of galley servitude was most common until galleys were abolished in 1748. After this the condemned were put to work in naval arsenals doing heavy work. Confinement originated from the &quot;hôpitaux généraux&quot; which were mostly asylums, though in Paris they included many convicts, and persisted up till the French Revolution.

The use of capital punishment and judicial torture declined during the eighteenth century and imprisonment came to dominate the system, although reform movements started almost immediately. Many countries were committed to the goal as a financially self-sustaining institution and the organization was often subcontracted to entrepreneurs, though this created its own tensions and abuse. By the mid nineteenth century several countries had initiated experiments in allowing the prisoners to choose the trades in which they were to be apprenticed. The growing amount of recidivism in the latter half of the nineteenth century led a number of criminologists to argue that &quot;imprisonment did not, and could not fulfill its original ideal of treatment aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community&quot;. Belgium led the way in introducing the suspended sentence for first-time offenders in 1888, followed by France in 1891 and most other countries in the next few years. Parole had been introduced on an experimental basis in France in the 1830s, with laws for juveniles introduced in 1850, and Portugal began to use it for adult criminals from 1861. The parole system introduced in France in 1885 made use of a strong private patronage network. Parole was approved throughout Europe at the International Prison Congress of 1910. As a result of these reforms the prison populations of many European countries halved in the first half of the twentieth century.

Exceptions to this trend included France and Italy between the world wars, when there was a huge increase in the use of imprisonment. The National Socialist state in Germany used it as an important tool to rid itself of its enemies as crime rates rocketed as a consequence of new categories of criminal behavior. Russia, which had only started to reform its penal and judicial system in 1860 by abolishing corporal punishment, continued the use of exile with hard labor as a punishment and this was increased to a new level of brutality under Joseph Stalin, despite early reforms by the Bolsheviks.

Postwar reforms stressed the need for the state to tailor punishment to the individual convicted criminal. In 1965, Sweden enacted a new criminal code emphasizing non-institutional alternatives to punishment including conditional sentences, probation for first-time offenders and the more extensive use of fines. The use of probation caused a dramatic decline in the number women serving long-term sentences: in France the number fell from 5,231 in 1946 to 1,121 in 1980. Probation spread to most European countries though the level of surveillance varies. In the Netherlands, religious and philanthropic groups are responsible for much of the probationary care. The Dutch government invests heavily in correctional personnel, having 3,100 for 4,500 prisoners in 1959.

However, despite these reforms, numbers in prison started to grow again after the 1960s even in countries committed to non-custodial policies.

====United Kingdom====
=====18th century=====
During the eighteenth century, British justice used a variety of measures to punish criminals, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to the American colonies was used until 1776. The death penalty could be imposed for many offenses.

John Howard&#x27;s book, &quot;The State of the Prisons&quot; was published in 1777. He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they could not pay the jailer&#x27;s fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity Howard League for Penal Reform takes its name from John Howard.

The Penitentiary Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3. c. 74) which passed following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.

Quakers such as Elizabeth Fry continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did Charles Dickens in his novels &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; about the Marshalsea. Samuel Romilly managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the Panopticon for the design of prisons and the use of the treadwheel as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline. Robert Peel&#x27;s Gaols Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 64) attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act 1877 (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. 21).

=====19th century=====
The American separate system attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of Millbank Prison in 1816 and Pentonville prison in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and Joshua Jebb set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year. The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the &#x27;flood of criminals&#x27; released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel Edmund Frederick du Cane, was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of &quot;hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed&quot;. In 1877 he encouraged Disraeli&#x27;s government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons. By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.

======1877–1914======
The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison life. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877–1914 era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 41) enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7. c. 17) introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. 58) required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67) prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. the chair of the Prison Commission.

======Winston Churchill======
Major reforms were championed by The Liberal Party government in 1906–1914. The key player was Winston Churchill when he was the Liberal Home Secretary, 1910–11. He first achieved fame as a prisoner in the Boer war in 1899. He escaped after 28 days and the media, and his own book, made him a national hero overnight. He later wrote, &quot;I certainly hated my captivity more than I have ever hated any other in my whole life... Looking back on those days I&#x27;ve always felt the keenest pity for prisoners and captives.&quot; As Home Secretary he was in charge of the nation&#x27;s penal system. Biographer Paul Addison says. &quot;More than any other Home Secretary of the 20th century, Churchill was the prisoner&#x27;s friend. He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.&quot; He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, shorten their terms, and make life in prison more tolerable, and rehabilitation more likely. His reforms were not politically popular, but they had a major long-term impact on the British penal system.

======Borstal system======
During 1894–95, Herbert Gladstone&#x27;s Committee on Prisons showed that criminal propensity peaked from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called &quot;Borstal&quot; after the village in Kent which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when Alexander Paterson became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the English Public school: cellblocks were designated as &#x27;houses&#x27; by name and had a &quot;housemaster&quot;. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the second world war when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself. Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including open prisons and housemasters, renamed &quot;assistant governors&quot; and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results.

===United States===

In colonial America, punishments were severe. The Massachusetts assembly in 1736 ordered that a thief, on first conviction, be fined or whipped. The second time he was to pay treble damages, sit for an hour upon the gallows platform with a noose around his neck and then be carted to the whipping post for thirty stripes. For the third offense he was to be hanged. But the implementation was haphazard as there was no effective police system and judges would not convict if they believed the punishment was excessive. The local jails mainly held men awaiting trial or punishment and those in debt.

In the aftermath of independence most states amended their criminal punishment statutes. Pennsylvania eliminated the death penalty for robbery and burglary in 1786, and in 1794 retained it only for first degree murder. Other states followed and in all cases the answer to what alternative penalties should be imposed was incarceration. Pennsylvania turned its old jail at Walnut Street into a state prison. New York built Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village and other states followed. But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes.

In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). This changed after Elam Lynds became agent and keeper of the prison and advanced a philosophy that no amount of punishment can reduce criminality. Lynds dismissed the concept of reform, instead treating prison labor as a resource to be exploited to the maximum capacity of the prisoner&#x27;s human body. Lynds&#x27; approach became known, and visitors who came to the U.S. to see the prisons that followed his approach included de Tocqueville, who wrote &quot;Democracy in America&quot; as a result of his visit. The system was criticized by prison reformers across the country, who preferred the Pennsylvania System and its focus on saving prisoners&#x27; souls.

By the 1860s prison overcrowding became an issue, in part because of the long sentences given for violent crimes and despite harsh treatment of prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, Enoch Wines and Theodore Dwight produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies. Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal. They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a &quot;National Congress&quot; in Cincinnati in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the Elmira Reformatory in New York in 1876 run by Zebulon Brockway. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of fixed sentences, prisoners who did well could be released early.

But by the 1890s, Elmira had twice as many inmates as it was designed for and they were not only the first offenders between 16 and 31 for which the program was intended. Although it had a number of imitators in different states, it did little to halt the deterioration of the country&#x27;s prisons which carried on a dreary life of their own. In the southern states, in which blacks made up more than 75% of the inmates, there was ruthless exploitation in which the states leased prisoners as chain gangs to entrepreneurs who treated them worse than slaves. By the 1920s drug use in prisons was also becoming a problem.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, psychiatric interpretations of social deviance were gaining a central role in criminology and policy making. By 1926, 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists. The language of medicine was applied in an attempt to &quot;cure&quot; offenders of their criminality. In fact, little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods. A system of probation was introduced, but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences, and the probation officers appointed had little training, and their caseloads numbered several hundred making assistance or surveillance practically impossible. At the same time they could revoke the probation status without going through another trial or other proper process.

In 1913, Thomas Mott Osborne became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a Mutual Welfare League at Auburn with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates. He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing and introduced recreation and movies. Osborne published in 1916 the book &quot;Society and Prisons: Some Suggestions for a New Penology&quot;, which influenced the discussion of prison reform and contributed to a change in societal perceptions of incarcerated individuals. Progressive reform resulted in the &quot;Big House&quot; by the late twenties – prisons averaging 2,500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor prevailing at the time.

The American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities, lack of hygiene or medical care, poor food quality, and guard brutality. In the next decade all these demands were recognized as rights by the courts. In 1954, the American Prison Association changed its name to the American Correctional Association and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.

Since the 1960s the prison population in the US has risen steadily, even during periods where the crime rate has fallen. This is partly due to profound changes in sentencing practices due to a denunciation of lenient policies in the late sixties and early seventies and assertions that rehabilitative purposes do not work. As a consequence sentencing commissions started to establish minimum as well as maximum sentencing guidelines, which have reduced the discretion of parole authorities and also reduced parole supervision of released prisoners. Another factor that contributed to the increase of incarcerations was the Reagan administration&#x27;s &quot;War On Drugs&quot; in the 1980s. This War increased money spent on lowering the number of illegal drugs in the United States. As a result, drug arrests increased and prisons became increasingly more crowded. The rising prison population was made up disproportionately of African American with 90% of those sentenced to prison for drug offense in Illinois in 2002. By 2010, the United States had more prisoners than any other country and a greater percentage of its population was in prison than in any other country in the world. &quot;Mass incarceration&quot; became a serious social and economic problem, as each of the 2.3 million American prisoners costs an average of about $25,000 per year. Recidivism remained high, and useful programs were often cut during the recession of 2009–2010. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Plata&quot; upheld the release of thousands of California prisoners due to California&#x27;s inability to provide constitutionally mandated levels of healthcare.

In 2015, a bipartisan effort was launched by Koch family foundations, the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation to more seriously address criminal justice reform in the United States. The Kochs and their partners are combatting the systemic overcriminalization and overincarceration of citizens from primarily low-income and minority communities. The group of reformers is working to reduce recidivism rates and diminish barriers faced by rehabilitated persons seeking new employment in the work force. In addition they have a goal in ending Asset forfeiture practices since law enforcement often deprives individuals of the majority of their private property.

Decarceration in the United States includes overlapping reformist and abolitionist strategies, from &quot;front door&quot; options such as sentencing reform, decriminalization, diversion and mental health treatment to &quot;back door&quot; approaches, exemplified by parole reform and early release into community supervision programs, amnesty for inmates convicted of non-violent offenses and imposition of prison capacity limits. While reforms focus on incremental changes, abolitionist approaches include budget reallocations, prison closures and restorative and transformative justice programs that challenge incarceration as an effective deterrent and necessary means of incapacitation. Abolitionists support investments in familial and community mental health, affordable housing and quality education to gradually transition and jail employees to jobs in other economic sectors.

==Theorists==

Numerous theorists have written on the topic of prison reform and advocated for scientific, compassionate, and evidence-based approaches to rehabilitation. One of the most famous was Thomas Mott Osborne, former prison commander of Portsmouth Naval Prison and former warden of New York&#x27;s Sing Sing prison, who himself chose to live briefly as a prisoner to better understand the prison experience. Osborne was a mentor to other renowned prison reform theorists, such as Austin MacCormick. Prisoners themselves, such as Victor Folke Nelson, have also contributed to the theories and literature on American prison reform.

==Theories of incarceration and reform==

===Retribution, vengeance and retaliation===
This is founded on the &quot;eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth&quot; incarceration philosophy, which essentially states that if one person harms another, then equivalent harm should be done to them. One goal here is to prevent vigilantism, gang or clan warfare, and other actions by those who have an unsatisfied need to &quot;get even&quot; for a crime against them, their family, or their group. It is, however, difficult to determine how to equate different types of &quot;harm&quot;. A literal case is where a murderer is punished with the death penalty, the argument being &quot;justice demands a life for a life&quot;. One criticism of long term prison sentences and other methods for achieving justice is that such &quot;warehousing&quot; of criminals is rather expensive, this argument notwithstanding the fact that the multiple incarceration appeals of a death penalty case often exceed the price of the &quot;warehousing&quot; of the criminal in question.
Yet another facet of this debate disregards the financial cost for the most part. The argument regarding warehousing rests, in this case, upon the theory that any punishment considered respectful of human rights should not include imprisoning humans for life without a chance of release—that even death is morally and ethically a higher road than no-parole prison sentences.

===Deterrence===
The criminal is used as a &quot;threat to themselves and others&quot;. By subjecting prisoners to harsh conditions, authorities hope to convince them to avoid future criminal behavior and to exemplify for others the rewards for avoiding such behavior; that is, the fear of punishment will win over whatever benefit or pleasure the illegal activity might bring. The deterrence model frequently goes far beyond &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, exacting a more severe punishment than would seem to be indicated by the crime. Torture has been used in the past as a deterrent, as has the public embarrassment and discomfort of stocks, and, in religious communities, ex-communication. Executions, particularly gruesome ones (such as hanging or beheading), often for petty offenses, are further examples of attempts at deterrence. One criticism of the deterrence model is that criminals typically have a rather short-term orientation, and the possibility of long-term consequences is of little importance to them. Also, their quality of life may be so horrific that any treatment within the criminal justice system (which is compatible with human rights law) will only be seen as an improvement over their previous situation. There used to be many European Monks who disagreed with the containment of the mentally ill, and their ethics had a strong influence on Dorothea Dix&#x27;s mission to find a proper way to care for the challenged people.

===Rehabilitation, reform and correction===
(&quot;Reform&quot; here refers to reform of the individual, not the reform of the penal system.) The goal is to &quot;repair&quot; the deficiencies in the individual and return them as productive members of society. Education, work skills, deferred gratification, treating others with respect, and self-discipline are stressed. Younger criminals who have committed fewer and less severe crimes are most likely to be successfully reformed. Art therapy is also considered to be beneficial for working with challenging prison demographics. &quot;Reform schools&quot; and &quot;boot camps&quot; are set up according to this model. One criticism of this model is that criminals are rewarded with training and other items which would not have been available to them had they not committed a crime. 

Art Therapy is a method of rehabilitation employed across the United States, especially in California. San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, formally known as San Quentin State Prison, is the oldest prison in California. Although primarily known for death row, it has recently been reformed into a hub for many rehabilitation programs under Governor Gavin Newsom. The recognition of the benefits of art therapy began as at least as early as 1840. California has implemented an Arts in Corrections program focused on providing incarcerated individuals across 35 adult facilities with the tools to express themselves visually, musically, and in writing. States like Colorado and Florida have provided similar resources to other facilities through adjacent initiatives like the FSU Art Therapy in Prisons Program. There have been significant associations made between rehabilitative programs and reduced recidivism rates, but some groups think it&#x27;s important to emphasize right to participate in these art programs without the focus only being on reintegration to society. 

Prior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary, formally known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia, had established a far reaching program of voluntary group therapy with the goal of having all inmates in the prison involved. From 1967 when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been successful as many inmates did volunteer for group therapy. An interesting aspect was that the groups were to be led by two therapists, one from the psychology or social work department and a second from one of the officers among the prison guard staff.

===Removal from society===
The goal here is simply to keep criminals away from potential victims, thus reducing the number of crimes they can commit. The criticism of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit to make up for the &quot;vacuum&quot; left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a drug dealer will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new drug dealer will then appear, to fill the void. This new drug dealer may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous drug dealer.

===Restitution or repayment===
Prisoners are forced to repay their &quot;debt&quot; to society. Unpaid or low pay work is common in many prisons, often to the benefit of the community. In some countries prisons operate as labour camps. Critics say that the repayment model gives government an economic incentive to send more people to prison. In corrupt or authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union under the control of Joseph Stalin, many citizens are sentenced to forced labour for minor breaches of the law, simply because the government requires the labour camps as a source of income. Community service is increasingly being used as an alternative to prison for petty criminals.

===Reduction in immediate costs===
Government and prison officials also have the goal of minimizing short-term costs; however, there could be a way for prisons to become self-sustaining independent institutions—with little need for government funds.

:In wealthy societies:
:This calls for keeping prisoners placated by providing them with things like television and conjugal visits. Inexpensive measures like these prevent prison assaults and riots which in turn allow the number of guards to be minimized. Providing the quickest possible parole and/or release also reduces immediate costs to the prison system (although these may very well increase long term costs to the prison system and society due to recidivism). The ultimate way to reduce immediate costs is to eliminate prisons entirely and use fines, community service, and other sanctions (like the loss of a driver&#x27;s license or the right to vote) instead. Executions at first would appear to limit costs, but, in most wealthy societies, the long appeals process for death sentences (and associated legal costs) make them quite expensive. Note that this goal may conflict with a number of goals for criminal justice systems.

:In poor societies:

:Poor societies, which lack the resources to imprison criminals for years, frequently use execution in place of imprisonment, for severe crimes. Less severe crimes, such as theft, might be dealt with by less severe physical means, such as amputation of the hands. When long term imprisonment is used in such societies, it may be a virtual death sentence, as the lack of food, sanitation, and medical care causes widespread disease and death, in such prisons.

Some of the goals of criminal justice are compatible with one another, while others are in conflict. In the history of prison reform, the harsh treatment, torture, and executions used for deterrence first came under fire as a violation of human rights. The salvation goal, and methods, were later attacked as violations of the individual&#x27;s freedom of religion. This led to further reforms aimed principally at reform/correction of the individual, removal from society, and reduction of immediate costs. The perception that such reforms sometimes denied victims justice then led to further changes.

==Advocacy work==
John Howard is now widely regarded as the founding father of prison reform, having travelled extensively visiting prisons across Europe in the 1770s and 1780s. Also, the great social reformer Jonas Hanway promoted &quot;&quot;solitude in imprisonment&quot;, with proper no one asked profitable labor and a spare diet&quot;. Indeed, this became the popular model in England for many decades.

===United Kingdom===
Within Britain, prison reform was spearheaded by the Quakers, and in particular, Elizabeth Fry during the Victorian Age. Elizabeth Fry visited prisons and suggested basic human rights for prisoners, such as privacy and teaching prisoners a trade. Fry was particularly concerned with women&#x27;s rights. Parliament, coming to realize that a significant portion of prisoners had come to commit crimes as a result of mental illness, passed the County Asylums Act (1808). This made it possible for Justice of the Peace in each county to build and run their own pauper asylums.

&quot;Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient&quot;

There is contemporary research on the use of volunteers by governments to help ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners. Research suggests that volunteers can be effective to ensure oversight of state functions and ensure accountability, however, they must be given tasks appropriately and well trained.

===United States===

In the 1800s, Dorothea Dix toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century. Linda Gilbert established 22 prison libraries of from 1,500 to 2,000 volumes each, in six states.

In the early 1900s Samuel June Barrows was a leader in prison reform. President Cleveland appointed him International Prison Commissioner for the U.S. in 1895, and in 1900, Barrows became Secretary of the Prison Association of New York and held that position until his death on April 21, 1909. A Unitarian pastor, Barrows used his influence as editor of the Unitarian &quot;Christian Register&quot; to speak at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, the National International Prison Congresses, and the Society for International Law. As the International Prison Commissioner for the U.S., he wrote several of today&#x27;s most valuable documents of American penological literature, including &quot;Children&#x27;s Courts in the United States&quot; and &quot;The Criminal Insane in the United States and in Foreign Countries&quot;. As a House representative, Barrows was pivotal in the creation of the International Prison Congress and became its president in 1905. In his final role, as Secretary of the Prison Association of New York, he dissolved the association&#x27;s debt, began issuing annual reports, drafted and ensured passage of New York&#x27;s first probation law, assisted in the implementation of a federal Parole Law, and promoted civil service for prison employees. Moreover, Barrows advocated improved prison structures and methods, traveling in 1907 around the world to bring back detailed plans of 36 of the best prisons in 14 different countries. In 1910 the National League of Volunteer Workers, nicknamed the &quot;Barrows League&quot; in his memory, formed in New York as a group dedicated to helping released prisoners and petitioning for better prison conditions.

Zebulon Brockway in &quot;Fifty Years of Prison Service&quot; outlined an ideal prison system: Prisoners should support themselves in prison though industry, in anticipation of supporting themselves outside prison; outside businesses and labor must not interfere; indeterminate sentences were required, making prisoners earn their release with constructive behavior, not just the passage of time; and education and a Christian culture should be imparted. Nevertheless, opposition to prison industries, the prison-industrial complex, and labor increased. Finally, U.S. law prohibited the transport of prison-made goods across state lines. Most prison-made goods today are only for government use—but the state and federal governments are not required to meet their needs from prison industries. Although nearly every prison reformer in history believed prisoners should work usefully, and several prisons in the 1800s were profitable and self-supporting, most American prisoners today do not have productive jobs in prison.

Kim Kardashian-West has fought for prison reform, notably visiting the White House to visit President Donald Trump in on May 30, 2018. In 2018, Trump announced he was providing clemency to Alice Johnson, a week after the meeting with Kardashian-West. Johnson was given a life sentence for drug charges. She has also helped with lobbying the First Step Act, reducing the federally mandated minimum prison sentences.

Rappers Jay-Z and Meek Mill have also been advocates for prison reform, both being very outspoken about the issue. In 2019, they announced the launching of an organization, REFORM Alliance, which aims to reduce the number of people who are serving probation and parole sentences that are unjust. The organization was able to pledge $50 million to debut, also deciding to bring on CNN news commentator Van Jones as CEO.

Musician Johnny Cash performed and recorded at many prisons and fought for prison reform. His song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; tells the tale from the perspective of a convicted killer in prison. It is named after Folsom State Prison, which is California&#x27;s second oldest correctional facility. Twelve years after the song was released, Cash performed it live at the prison.

Not all prison reformers approach the problem from the left side of the political spectrum, although most do. In &quot;How to Create American Manufacturing Jobs&quot;, it was proposed that restrictions on prison industries and labor and federal employment laws be eliminated so that prisoners and private employers could negotiate wage agreements to make goods now made exclusively overseas. This would boost prison wages and revitalize prison industries away from the money-losing state industries approach that now limits prison labor and industries. Prisoners want to work, but there are not enough jobs in prison for them to be productive. Nonprofit can help voice issues as seen by inmates on the other side, however limits to funding and access to those currently incarcerated limit the ability of these NGOs.

On December 21, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the First Step Act bill into law. The First Step Act has provisions to ease prison sentences for drug related crimes, and promote good behavior in federal prisons. Clementine Jacoby&#x27;s &quot;Recidiviz&quot; looks to reduce incarceration rates by making complex and fragmented criminal justice data usable, which enables leaders to take data-driven action and track the impacts of their decisions.

<doc id="1160235" wikidata="Q3294080" url="?curid=1160235" title="Mark Foo">
<text>Mark Sheldon Foo was a professional surfer who favored big wave surfing. Foo drowned while surfing at Mavericks, Half Moon Bay, California, in 1994.

==Early life==
Mark Foo was born in Singapore on February 5, 1958, to Colonel Charlie and Lorna Foo, Chinese photojournalists for the U.S. Information Agency. The family relocated to Hawaii when Foo was 10. He spent his early childhood surfing the South Shore of O&#x27;ahu, and continued surfing throughout his teenage years. His family moved several times during his adolescence but ultimately returned to Hawaii just before Foo finished high school. He studied for two years at the University of Hawaii.

==Career==
In 1977, Foo joined the IPS World Tour, a professional surfing tour. In the early 1980s, Foo quit the IPS World Tour and stopped competing. Foo&#x27;s passion for surfing big waves led him to surf larger and larger swells. In 1983, he surfed Waimea Bay, a famous big-wave surfing spot on the North Shore of O&#x27;ahu, for the first time. 

But it was on January 18, 1986, when he ventured out into the bay with waves that onlookers said were in excess of 60 feet, that he rose to fame. When Foo fell off the overhanging ledge, the crashing wave broke his surfboard and tossed him into the water. Foo had to be rescued by a nearby helicopter, yet he emerged from the crash unharmed. He sent the story to various surfing magazines, but failed in the attempt to raise his surfing status to that of a &quot;demigod.&quot;

==Death at Mavericks==
On December 23, 1994, Foo died in a surfing accident at Mavericks, a big-wave surf location in Half Moon Bay, Northern California. &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine wrote that Foo was sleep-deprived after arriving in California on an overnight flight for the swell. During takeoff on a wave estimated at 18–20 feet (Hawaiian scale), Foo experienced a seemingly innocuous wipeout and drowned. The fateful wipeout was photographed from at least two angles, and shows him falling forward near the bottom of the wave. 

The most popular presumption is that Foo&#x27;s surf leash had become entangled on the rocks, with the rushing currents of a second wave passing overhead preventing him from disengaging his ankle strap and getting to the surface. This theory was further validated when professional surfer Mike Parsons, who wiped out on the following wave, said that he came into contact with something, possibly Foo, as he was tumbled around underwater. Foo&#x27;s body was discovered still tied to the broken tail section of his board inside Pillar Point lagoon over two hours later. The coroner&#x27;s report cited &quot;salt-water drowning&quot; and &quot;blunt head trauma&quot; as his causes of death.

Foo&#x27;s death shook the big-wave surfing community. On December 30, over 700 people arrived at Waimea Bay for his funeral. Approximately 150 surfers paddled into and formed a large circle. One of the participants, who was carrying a container with Foo&#x27;s ashes, paddled into the center of the circle and placed the ashes into the ocean. A segment of the film &quot;Riding Giants&quot; documented Foo&#x27;s death at Mavericks.

==Legacy==
Foo founded a hostel, Backpackers Hawaii, in Pupukea.
The hostel&#x27;s website maintains an online memorial for him.

Foo helped elevate the popularity of the sport, with his talent, courage, and enthusiasm, and was recognized as one of the greatest big-wave surfers of all time. Mark was a favorite subject of photographers, and he had his own cable television surfing program. &quot;If you want to ride the ultimate wave, you have to be willing to pay the ultimate price&quot; was Foo&#x27;s philosophy.

In the realm of big-wave surfing, Foo&#x27;s death brought about a continuing discourse regarding the safe use of surfboard leashes, or flexible cords that connect the surfboard to a belt on the surfers ankle. Proponents defend the leash as a useful convenience and insurance against losing the surfboard, which serves as flotation device in the case of a &quot;wipe out.&quot; They also assert that the leash is a means for a fallen surfer to find his way to surface air by following the leash cord to the floating surfboard on the water&#x27;s surface. 

There are also surfers who believe that Foo&#x27;s surfboard leash may have caused or contributed to his death. Opponents of leashes in big surf assert that a leash can cause the surfer to collide with the board in a wipe out, potentially causing head injuries, and that the leash can also loop around the arms, legs, or neck, dangerously restricting escape to safety or strangling the surfer. Quick-release Velcro leashes have since become standard surfing equipment to address some of these dangers. The debates continue to this day.

American rock band Seventeen (later known as Lustra) performed a musical tribute (misspelled as &quot;Mark Fu&quot;) on their 2000 LP Bikini Pie Fight!.

<doc id="1160237" wikidata="Q7731700" url="?curid=1160237" title="The Electors' Action Movement">
<text>The Electors&#x27; Action Movement (TEAM) was a centrist political party from 1968 to the mid-1980s at the municipal level in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It fielded candidates for the office of mayor as well as for positions on the City Council, School Board, and Park Board. It was most successful in the 1970s when it held the majority of council seats from 1972 to 1976.

Retrospective accounts of TEAM have painted it as distinctly shifting civic governance in Vancouver when it gained power. Rod Mickleburgh of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote in 2013 that TEAM&#x27;s Art Phillips&#x27; four years as mayor &quot;were pivotal in changing the face of Canada&#x27;s third largest city, just when it seemed to be headed for pell-mell, American-style development that was ruining so many cities south of the border&quot;. May Brown, one of the original TEAM members who represented the party on council for ten years, told Pat Johnson of the &quot;Vancouver Courier&quot; in 1999 that &quot;TEAM radically altered the face of city government&quot;.

==Creation==

The catalyst for the creation of TEAM was a proposal to build a freeway through historic Chinatown. At the time, power at City Hall was not in the hands of the elected mayor and aldermen, but in those of two appointed city commissioners. In 1959, one of the commissioners, chief planner Gerald Sutton-Brown, generated a city plan that former TEAM alderman and transportation engineer Setty Pendakur described as &quot;completely automobile and freeway oriented&quot;.

While such freeways were being built in major cities throughout North America at that time, in Vancouver, opposition grew as the plans progressed. By the fourth quarter of 1967, a public hearing on how the route was chosen turned into one of the &quot;wildest, most stormy meetings ever seen at city hall&quot;, wrote &quot;The Province&#x27;s&quot; Bud Elsie. The nearly 500 people who attended, most of whom were opposed to freeways, turned it into a networking opportunity, &quot;and, with their vest pocket diaries in hand, eagerly arranged to meet again for further discussion&quot;. Those further discussions led to the formation of a political movement that in just nine months would develop policies and attract candidates to run for every position in the next civic election.

TEAM came into being at a public meeting held at Vancouver&#x27;s Grandview Community Centre on March 12, 1968. The founding president was Phillips, the head of a successful Vancouver investment firm; first and second vice-presidents were broadcasting executive Bill Bellman and labour leader Ed Lawson. Also on the founding executive committee were hotelier Frank Bernard; UBC history of medicine professor W. C. Gibson; Citizens&#x27; Housing Council president Alice Moore; head of UBC&#x27;s department of community and regional planning; Peter Oberlander; UBC geography professor Walter Hardwick; businessman Charles Jordan-Knox; lawyer Haig Farris; and West Vancouver councillor Donald Lanskail.

In less than five years&#x27; time, TEAM would be in a position to shift the power balance at City Hall and implement the policies for which the electors had voted.

==Policies and platform==

TEAM sought to be a moderate reform group committed to democratic principles, appealing to people of all political leanings. Its candidates would be tied to policies determined by the general membership. In contrast, the ruling Non-Partisan Association endorsed individuals, but not policies. Oberlander described TEAM as the first civic party to run on a platform and with a caucus on council, school board and park board that could coordinate coherent policy.

Within a month of the founding meeting, about 150 people met at the Waldorf Hotel to set up committees dealing with all aspects of civic life. There were four subcommittees and a special research committee, operating under an over-all policy committee headed by Oberlander and Farris. Oberlander stated, &quot;We want to involve the maximum number of people in the evolution of our policies.&quot;

In August 1968, TEAM released its procedure on selection of candidates. Instead of candidates being appointed by the executive board, every eligible nomination would be voted on by the entire membership.

In September, there was a general membership meeting to present, discuss and vote on the policies TEAM would promote. These included:
*creation of a Vancouver Development Authority to plan growth in the city core and particularly False Creek and the downtown waterfront
*outside of the downtown core, planned commercial and residential districts, each with its own &quot;core&quot;
*a &quot;parks for people&quot; program aimed at securing park land for future generations
*greater involvement in regional municipal government
*a mayoral executive committee to oversee city management and &quot;give the government back to the elected representatives&quot;.
*an expanded city council with some aldermen elected at large and others by district

Political opponents criticized the latter as a step backwards to the patronage and cronyism of ward systems past. But Phillips said TEAM had never used the word &quot;ward&quot; and instead was advocating a system of partial area representation. He said Vancouver was the only major city in Canada that elected all its aldermen at large, so this proposal was hardly revolutionary. Partial area representation would mean fewer names on the ballot and district aldermen &quot;would be available to perform the ombudsman function which is so important if we are to counteract the feeling of alienation that exists all over this city&quot;. He added that the district aldermen would ensure points of view from all parts of the city would be represented on council, while the at-large aldermen meant a balance would always exist between neighbourhood and city-wide concerns.

==First civic election: limited success in 1968==

Running under the TEAM banner, Burnaby mayor Alan Emmott lost to NPA incumbent Tom Campbell, who received fifty percent more votes. Hardwick and Phillips took two of ten council seats, with Phillips moving up from eleventh spot after a recount. For school board, Oberlander topped the polls, while Fritz Bowers and Peter Bullen also won seats. Helen Boyce was elected to the park board. In the aftermath, a &quot;Province&quot; analysis suggested TEAM had made a tactical error in choosing an outsider as its mayoral candidate. And &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; wrote that Hardwick, &quot;while pleased about his own win, said the people were &#x27;obviously not ready&#x27; for the TEAM concept. &#x27;It is an organization 40 years ahead of its time.&quot;

In their first year on council, Phillips and Hardwick were vocal about the need for change. At a TEAM meeting, Phillips cited the lease of land to the Pacific National Exhibition and lack of development in False Creek as &quot;glaring examples of stupid management policies&quot;. Hardwick promoted False Creek as a major residential, recreational and service area in the future, complaining that &quot;some aldermen can&#x27;t see anything in False Creek except industry&quot;.

The two were busy. Phillips succeeded in a motion to have the planning department investigate rezoning the 1000 block of Robson Street for a high-rise apartment district with two levels of pedestrian-oriented shopping malls. Hardwick proposed changes to the city charter to allow for elections earlier in the autumn, and for ballots to include candidates&#x27; names in non-alphabetical order, along with political affiliations. With NPA alderman Brian Calder, who often voted with them, they did a helicopter tour of the city to check out air pollution.

By early 1970, Phillips and Hardwick had made an impact. &quot;Province&quot; columnist Lorne Parton wrote that their record &quot;has given the movement respectability and credibility&quot;. And the left-leaning Committee of Progressive Electors (COPE), criticized the news media for &quot;playing down news on city political organizations other than the one they supported, TEAM&quot;.

During the year, park board commissioner Boyce left TEAM to join the NPA and Calder joined TEAM. With the election approaching, TEAM chose William C. Gibson as its mayoral candidate and endorsed a full slate for city council, including Calder, Hardwick and Phillips. The sitting school trustees were nominated along with six others, and there was a full park board slate.

Candidates for city council said they were united by &quot;a common concern for the quality of life in Vancouver&quot; and cited as accomplishments the halt to the downtown freeway and progress toward development of False Creek. Park board candidates promised a complete review of the operations of the Park Board and greater control of pollution. School board candidates pledged to promote students&#x27; choice in schools and programs, and greater autonomy for students as they aged.

==1970: Same number of seats but other gains==

Gibson did not defeat the incumbent mayor Tom Campbell, but closed the gap significantly compared with the 1968 result. TEAM&#x27;s three sitting aldermen were re-elected, this time placing in the top five. TEAM elected three school trustees; a fourth almost made it but an NPA candidate eventually took the spot. Art Cowie was elected to the park board.

Campbell began his third term by placing himself and his six NPA aldermen in ten choice appointments to committees and boards. Hardwick said TEAM had tried to avoid an opposition role on council &quot;but Campbell has obviously decided to run the body on partisan political lines&quot;.

However, the NPA&#x27;s subsequent behaviour on council opened opportunities for TEAM. When three NPA aldermen did not attend a public meeting where citizens presented briefs in favour of parks for people, not cars, the TEAM–COPE bloc reversed an earlier council decision to proceed with plans for a six-lane road through what would become Jericho park. Campbell himself was frequently absent, and the structure and functioning of council itself came under question. All three TEAM aldermen filled in for Campbell when he was away, and a &quot;Province&quot; story described how Phillips spent his time in the mayor&#x27;s office &quot;priming an engine that had practically ceased to function. Phillips brought action on urban renewal, Jericho land proposals and scores of minor matters during his brief tenure.&quot;

During this period, TEAM raised many questions about the way the city and the electoral system ran. It proposed a larger council with an executive group chosen from its ranks that would take full-time responsibility for governing; evening meetings so more citizens could attend; cash deposits for civic candidates, and the elimination of voting privileges for corporations. Calder, who had proposed the council restructuring, quit the Town Planning Commission, dismissing it as a toothless body used to pasture off defeated NPA candidates. He suggested it should instead be a non-political body transmitting public opinions on planning matters to council.

In announcing his candidacy for mayor in the 1972 election, Phillips &quot;said the first priority of his administration would be to make &#x27;livability&#x27; the top planning objective in Vancouver. He said the practice of seeking development for development&#x27;s sake has got to end.&quot;

As the election approached, Phillips&#x27; star was in the ascendant. In an August profile, &quot;The Vancouver Sun&#x27;s&quot; Lisa Hobbs wrote: &quot;Being in charge is not only something Phillips is good at but is something he revels in. No trace of a hang-up, philosophical or psychological, mitigates his delight in being boss.&quot; In accepting TEAM&#x27;s mayoral nomination in October, Phillips said, &quot;Citizen action won some big battles in the last few years against bulldozers and freeways and shopping centres but they won the hard way. They had to fight city hall. I want people to feel that the city government is there to serve them, not to rule them.&quot; TEAM nominated candidates for every position and encouraged electors to vote for its whole slate.

==1972: Landslide==

On December 13, voters preferred Phillips as mayor by a factor of nearly six to one. TEAM elected eight aldermen to the ten-seat council, with Hardwick topping the polls. The others were lawyer Michael Harcourt, physician William Gibson, architect Geoffrey Massey, lawyer Jack Volrich, engineer Fritz Bowers, social worker/community planner Darlene Marzari and engineer and planner Setty Pendakur. TEAM would control the school board, with eight of nine trustees, and the park board, with four commissioners to the NPA&#x27;s three. Pendakur was the first South Asian to be elected alderman, and new school trustee Jack Say Yee was the first Chinese-Canadian to be elected to civic office in Vancouver.

UBC political scientist Paul Tennant, writing on Vancouver civic politics in &quot;BC Studies&quot;, described the new council as &quot;the cream of the cream in terms of educational and professional attainment&quot;, adding it&#x27;s likely &quot;that few, if any, other cosmopolitan cities with open elections have ever produced a city council composed so completely of persons of high occupational and social status&quot;. He noted that all had university degrees, four were university professors, and on average they were more than a decade younger than the NPA members of the previous council.

Following Phillip&#x27;s swearing-in as Vancouver&#x27;s 32nd mayor, &quot;The Province&quot; noted that it had been five years since TEAM was formed to combat what sponsors felt was aimless civic leadership. &quot;TEAM&#x27;s drive for power is over; now the work begins.&quot; The new council&#x27;s priorities were listed as: &quot;More consultation with the people of Vancouver on policy; better bus service and, eventually, a rapid transit system; more direct leadership by elected representatives; evening council meetings that more residents can attend; restoration of the committee system that gives each alderman specific responsibilities; new downtown and West End zoning; greater co-operation with the park board in environment matters; a waterfront development study; greater leadership in the Greater Vancouver Regional District.

Control of business at city hall meant a shake-up of the established bureaucracy, and TEAM Council&#x27;s first move was to encourage the resignation of city commissioner Gerald Sutton-Brown, who had been the strongest proponent of the freeway system. &quot;Sutton Brown&#x27;s departure stood as a powerful symbol of regime change in the local state. [...] Citizen involvement in planning, a focus on regional planning, and an effort to accommodate downtown living became norms.&quot;

There were bumps along the way. Council overruled the recommendations of Hardwick&#x27;s committee on the topic of underground shopping malls, which the committee opposed for the damage they do to ground-level street life. A couple of weeks later, at its annual meeting, TEAM voted to make it official party policy to ban more downtown underground malls.

At the park board, Cowie was seeking some control over the finances for parks and recreation and complaining that &quot;the new TEAM council is no more receptive to park board matters than the old NPA council&quot;. The elected board should do more than rubber-stamp staff proposals, he said. The ensuing conflict led to the abrupt resignation of a long-time bureaucrat, and NPA commissioners blaming Cowie for staff morale plunging to the lowest ebb they said they&#x27;d ever seen. Things improved after council approved the expenditure of $11,000 for a management review of the park board, which resulted in a new administrative structure and staff organization. Historian R. Mike Steele wrote that after decades of adversarial relations between the park board and city council, things changed greatly in the two years after the 1972 election. He attributed the greater cooperation to the majority of elected officials from both bodies being &quot;political comrades bent on amending a structure they viewed as unresponsive ... Greater public participation certainly became a feature of park planning.&quot;

During its first term the TEAM council implemented much of its policy platform. The freeway proposal was finally killed. Neighbourhood participation in local area planning was encouraged. Granville Mall was planned and completed. A bylaw phased out advertising billboards. Zoning and procedural changes controlled downtown development. New requirements for early public notice and the creation of the Development Permit Board abolished secrecy in the development process. The former industrial area of False Creek was transformed into a residential area under direct development by the city itself. The False Creek plan would be an important legacy, as noted by writer Brian Palmquist fifty years later: &quot;TEAM and the mayor, together with planning staff led by director of planning Ray Spaxman, set at least three key precedents in the planning of False Creek South: the housing mix, the parks, and the waterfront walkway

==1974: Second majority==

Phillips was returned to the mayor&#x27;s chair with a closer vote, receiving 37,220 to his NPA opponent George Puil&#x27;s 27,686. During the campaign Puil, a long-time park board commissioner, accused TEAM of failing to act on rising crime and vandalism, squandering civic resources, aggravating the housing crisis, making Vancouver a haven for welfare bums and promoting permissiveness in schools. Five TEAM aldermen were elected: Harcourt, Bowers, Volrich, Marzari and Cowie. TEAM elected six school trustees and five park board commissioners, retaining control of both bodies.

Land and housing issues dominated TEAM&#x27;s second mandate. Council approved a property endowment fund that would &quot;maintain or increase the City&#x27;s ownership of strategic land&quot;, support its planning and development objectives, and produce a reasonable return on its property investments. Phillips&#x27; housing priorities were to set policy on secondary suites to maintain quality of neighbourhoods and provide lower-priced rentals while helping families gain equity in their homes, &quot;enough to make living in Vancouver affordable again&quot;. He also wanted the city to initiate more seniors&#x27; housing.

But housing was always controversial. Council gave final approval for the residential development on the south shore of False Creek against the wishes of those who wanted the area for parkland. In Kitsilano, it approved the demolition of city-owned houses to create waterfront parks despite arguments that the homes should be retained because of the housing shortage. &quot;Mayor Art Phillips who supported the demolitions said the city would probably always have a housing crisis in the future&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; reported.

In June 1975, there was a serious rift on TEAM over a proposed co-op that would have doubled the zoned density on a single-family block near UBC. Phillips and Volrich voted with the NPA against it. Marzari, who was a proponent, said she was sad to belong to a reform party that was unaccountable to its members. It was &quot;irrevocably split&quot; on the issue, she said, but she was glad the split &quot;had finally come into the open&quot;.

There was dismay in the TEAM ranks. &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that Phillips and Volrich were asked to justify their &quot;direct contradiction of TEAM&#x27;s housing policy that a variety of housing styles serving a variety of income levels be available in all areas of the city&quot;. By the end of the summer, The Sun was suggesting that Phillips might run for the NPA while Harcourt would be TEAM&#x27;s pick for mayor in 1976. Two months later, a few days after Marzari quit TEAM to finish her term as an independent, Phillips announced he would not run in 1976, telling reporters he had accomplished most of what he had set out to do and was ready for a return to private life.

In January 1976, Province columnist Nate Smith was pessimistic about TEAM&#x27;s chances in that fall&#x27;s election, noting that president Don Bellamy had told a television interviewer that he felt like the &quot;captain of the Titanic&quot;. The party&#x27;s &quot;nebulous document known as &#x27;TEAM policy&#x27; is the organization&#x27;s problem, because at the moment TEAM really has no idea what it stands for&quot;, Smith wrote.

Phillips did not attend TEAM&#x27;s annual general meeting in February. There, Harcourt warned that he&#x27;d find it difficult to support the party unless it restored itself as a grassroots movement, and he lamented the loss of TEAM&#x27;s former energy and excitement and some of its community organizers.

In May, Volrich announced he would run for mayor, with or without TEAM&#x27;s endorsement. &quot;Volrich said some crucial questions must be faced in the city: How large a population, how much housing and what degree density, how much additional office and commercial space should be allowed.&quot;

Harcourt also sought TEAM&#x27;s mayoral nomination, initially saying that if he failed, he would run for alderman. But when Volrich was chosen, he changed his mind and resigned from the party. A pre-election editorial endorsed Volrich for mayor, noting that while the differences between TEAM and the NPA seem inconsequential, given TEAM&#x27;s move to the right, TEAM &quot;is more likely to continue the trend to more human proportions in city development&quot;, noting its innovations such as Granville Mall, Gastown and the False Creek mixed housing program.

==1976: Minority council==

On November 19, Volrich became TEAM&#x27;s second mayor, doubling the votes of NPA&#x27;s Ed Sweeney. Successful TEAM alderman candidates were May Brown, Marguerite Ford, Bill Gibson and Don Bellamy. Harcourt and Marzari were elected as independents. TEAM took the first six of nine places on the school board and kept its majority on park board, electing four commissioners.

==1978 to 1984: Ebbing support==

TEAM fielded a full slate in the 1978 election, with May Brown as the mayoral hopeful. She was defeated by Volrich who, running as an independent, received a greater percentage of the vote than he had in 1976. Ford won the sole council seat for TEAM, which elected only two school trustees and two park board commissioners.

The 1978 election included a plebiscite on the institution of a ward system, but the 51.7% vote in favour wasn&#x27;t considered high enough to move ahead. In 1979, council voted to examine alternatives to the at-large system. Harcourt, seconded by Marzari, proposed that council pursue a full ward system. The motion was defeated by Volrich and the NPA majority, along with Ford, who thought it too vague.

By the end of 1979, the press was speculating on a third term for Volrich and commenting on the state of the civic parties. &quot;It shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten that the NPA group rode on Volrich&#x27;s coat-tails in the 1978 election... After the Volrich victory, the NPA breathed a sigh of relief and went back to sleep. As an organization, it has virtually no identityonly a title. The Electors&#x27; Action Movement has at least held an annual meeting and elected a new panel of officers, maintaining some show of activity.&quot;

In the 1980 election, Harcourt edged out Volrich, and TEAM&#x27;s Martin Zlotnik came a distant third in the mayoral race. Brown and Ford were elected to council. No TEAM candidates were elected to school or park board.

Post-election analyses of TEAM&#x27;s weaknesses helped explain its fall: the discouraging perception that it was washed up; the view that it was too conservative and its members had become complacent; the defections of Marzari, Harcourt and Volrich. Brown, who regained her council seat, said the perception of TEAM could not be good or more people would have voted for Zlotnik. &quot;&#x27;There is a big rebuilding job to come,&#x27; she said. Brown agreed that a resurrection of TEAM would take a lot of work and there would be no guarantee of success.&quot;

The big issue of 1982 was another ward system plebiscite, which was approved by nearly 57 percent of voters. TEAM did not propose a mayoral candidate, but its two incumbent aldermen, Brown and Ford, ran and were elected, Brown placing a close second to poll-topper Harry Rankin of COPE.

In a 1982 column, Alan Fotheringham described how neither TEAM nor the NPA had been able to stop the rise of the left. &quot;The progress of the left in the city of yachts and skis began a decade ago with the collapse of the real estate shield known as the Non-Partisan Association (NPA), so-named because it was vigorously partisan, formed to keep the dreaded socialists out of city hall. An academic-based reform group, The Electors&#x27; Action Movement (TEAM), picked up the pieces and greened Vancouver as the freeway forces were blocked. But TEAM, composed of quiche-eating Volvo drivers who carpooled their children to French immersion courses, didn&#x27;t have the staying power of the humorless east side angries who have been steadily building their base on council, school board and park board.&quot;

In 1984, Brown and Ford again held their council seats. Two TEAM candidates for park board and one for school board were defeated.

Early in 1986, COPE&#x27;s success in a byelection galvanized TEAM into action. Concerned about the prospect of a COPE-dominated council with Rankin at the helm, the party was making plans for a post-Expo 86 future. A &quot;Province&quot; story described Brown as &quot;excited by the whole new mood and people wanting to get together the way they did in 1968&quot;. It noted that TEAM president Walter Hardwick believed polarized politics were taking precedence over solving urgent civic issues and that &quot;ideology is clearly interfering with the advancement of public interest.&#x27;&quot;

Phillips&#x27; former executive assistant Gordon Campbell, then an alderman, announced his candidacy for mayor and had the support of TEAM&#x27;s May Brown. In the fourth quarter of 1986, a retirement party was held for Brown, who was &quot;leaving politics without regret&quot; after eight years on council, four on park board, and a 1978 mayoral run. &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; columnist Pete McMartin noted, &quot;Her absence from Vancouver civic politics will leave a very big gap to be filled. It may mean the endin name, anyway, of TEAM and its eventual amalgamation into the remade NPA under Gordon Campbell.&quot;

The idea of amalgamating the NPA and TEAM caused a ruckus in the TEAM organization. Hardwick, a former alderman and member of TEAM since its founding in 1967, resigned as president because some board members were prepared to endorse Campbell and his NPA slate, The Sun reported. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in coalitions and alliances&quot;, was the quote from Hardwick.

Ford was the only TEAM candidate in the November 1986 election; she ended in eleventh place. Campbell easily defeated Rankin and was elected mayor with seven NPA aldermen. COPE lost eight of its nine seats to the NPA, which swept the park board.

==Legacies==

In 1988, columnist Denny Boyd characterized TEAM as &quot;the civic party that developed three mayors, Art Phillips, Jack Volrich and Mike Harcourt, before fracturing and collapsing on itself and vanishing&quot;. But besides developing mayors, TEAM made many changes to the city&#x27;s structure, neighbourhoods and operations that continue to shape it today.
Among the innovations at city hall:
*TEAM made civic government more accessible to residents by changing the time of meetings and welcoming delegations to speak.
*Vancouver&#x27;s Property Endowment Fund was created to keep city land in city hands, preventing it from being sold for revenue.
*The development approvals process was initiated, including providing citizens with early information (development application notice boards) and an opportunity for input.
*The Heritage Advisory Board (now Heritage Commission) was created to catalog and retain historic buildings and areas.
*Local area planning was established in Fairview, Kitsilano, Champlain Heights, Killarney and the West End.

Neighbourhoods, parks and buildings:
*The planned medium-density neighbourhood on the formerly industrial south shore of False Creek is considered one of the most attractive and livable waterfront communities in Canada. 
*Zoning was made for flexible to allow for residential buildings in the downtown commercial core.
*Granville Island was acquired and designed.
*Gastown was preserved and revitalized.
*Granville Mall was created.
*Land was acquired to complete public ownership of Langara Golf Course.
*The historic Orpheum Theatre was saved from demolition and acquired and refurbished as a civic theatre.
*Jericho Beach Park remains in a mostly natural state without a six-lane road bisecting it. The TEAM park board established a citizen&#x27;s planning advisory committee for Jericho Beach Park in 1973.
*The Britannia Community Centre and West End Community Centre were created.
*The historic neighbourhoods of Strathcona and Chinatown were saved from destruction by the freeway that would also have blocked the Burrard Inlet waterfront from public access.
*Vancouver&#x27;s first bicycle path was opened in 1974: a trail in Stanley Park.
*Mini-parks were introduced in the West End.
*Land for the Everett Crowley Park was acquired.

Other amenities introduced:
*The city was made more accessible thanks to by-laws mandating curb cuts, ramps, handicap washrooms, and auditory crosswalks.
*The 9-1-1 emergency telephone service was established.
*A sign by-law largely abolished billboards.

<doc id="1160238" wikidata="Q697059" url="?curid=1160238" title="Battle of Hong Kong">
<text>The Battle of Hong Kong (8–25 December 1941), also known as the Defence of Hong Kong and the Fall of Hong Kong, was one of the first battles of the Pacific War in World War II. On the same morning as the attack on Pearl Harbor, forces of the Empire of Japan attacked the British Crown colony of Hong Kong around the same time that Japan declared war on Great Britain. The Hong Kong garrison consisted of British, Indian and Canadian units, also the Auxiliary Defence Units and Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps (HKVDC).

Of the three territories of Hong Kong, the defenders abandoned the two mainland territories of Kowloon and New Territories within a week. Less than two weeks later, with their last territory Hong Kong Island untenable, the colony surrendered.
==Background==
Britain first thought of Japan as a threat with the ending of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1921, a threat that increased throughout the 1930s with the escalation of the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 21 October 1938 the Japanese occupied Canton (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong was surrounded. British defence studies concluded that Hong Kong would be extremely hard to defend in the event of a Japanese attack, but in the mid-1930s work began on improvements to defences including along the Gin Drinkers&#x27; Line. By 1940, the British determined to reduce the Hong Kong Garrison to only a symbolic size. Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command argued that limited reinforcements could allow the garrison to delay a Japanese attack, gaining time elsewhere. Winston Churchill and the general staff named Hong Kong as an outpost, and decided against sending more troops. In September 1941, they reversed their decision and argued that additional reinforcements would provide a military deterrent against the Japanese and reassure Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek that Britain was serious about defending the colony.

The plan for the defence of Hong Kong was that a delaying action would be fought in the New Territories and Kowloon peninsula to allow the destruction of vital infrastructure and stores there. The Gin Drinker&#x27;s Line was expected to hold out for at least three weeks, following which all defenders would withdraw to Hong Kong Island which would be defended and use of the harbour denied until reinforcements could arrive from Singapore or the Philippines.

According to the history manual of the United States Military Academy: &quot;Japanese control of Canton, Hainan Island, French Indo-China, and Formosa virtually sealed the fate of Hong Kong well before the firing of the first shot&quot;. The British military in Hong Kong grossly underestimated the capabilities of the Japanese forces and downplayed assessments that the Japanese posed a serious threat as &#x27;unpatriotic&#x27; and &#x27;insubordinate&#x27;.

US Consul Robert Ward, the highest ranking US official posted to Hong Kong in the period preceding the outbreak of hostilities, offered a first-hand explanation for the rapid collapse of defences in Hong Kong by saying that the local British community had insufficiently prepared itself or the Chinese populace for war. He highlighted the prejudiced attitudes held by those governing the Crown Colony of Hong Kong: &quot;several of them (the British rulers) said frankly that they would rather turn the island over to the Japanese rather than to turn it over to the Chinese, by which they meant rather than employ Chinese to defend the colony they would surrender it to the Japanese&quot;.

Colonel Reynolds Condon, a US Army assistant military attaché who witnessed the battle and was taken prisoner by the Japanese, wrote up his observations on military preparedness before the commencement of hostilities and on the execution of operations thereafter.

==Order of battle==
===Allied order of battle===
====Indian Army====

The 5/7th Battalion, Rajput Regiment took up garrison at Hong Kong in June 1937 followed by the 2/14th Battalion, Punjab Regiment in November 1940. Indian troops were also incorporated within several overseas regiments as for example the Hong Kong Singapore Royal Artillery Regiment which had Indian (Sikh) gunners. The Hong Kong Mule Corps was staffed almost entirely by Dogras and Punjabi Muslims. Medical personnel from the Indian Medical Service tended to those injured in combat. Ex-servicemen from India serving as security guards in Hong Kong also suffered &quot;appallingly huge&quot; casualties.

====Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery====
Coastal defence batteries, including those at Stonecutters Island, Pak Sha Wan, Lyemun fort, Saiwan, Mount Collinson, Mount Parker, Belchers, Mount Davis, Jubilee Hill, Bokara, and Stanley, provided artillery support for ground operations until they were put out of action or they surrendered. Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery, which was raised with troops recruited from Undivided India, also suffered heavy casualties during the Battle of Hong Kong and are commemorated with names inscribed on panels at the entrance to Sai Wan War Cemetery: 144 killed, 45 missing and 103 wounded.

====Canadian Army (C Force)====
In late 1941, the British government accepted an offer by the Canadian Government to send a battalion of the Royal Rifles of Canada (from Quebec) and one of the Winnipeg Grenadiers (from Manitoba) and a brigade headquarters (1,975 personnel) to reinforce the Hong Kong garrison. &quot;C Force&quot;, as it was known, arrived on 16 November on board the troopship and the armed merchant cruiser . A total of 96 officers, two Auxiliary Services supervisors and 1,877 other ranks disembarked. Included were two medical officers and two nurses ( to the regimental medical officers), two Canadian Dental Corps officers with assistants, three chaplains and a detachment of the Canadian Postal Corps. A soldier of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC), had stowed away and was sent back to Canada.

The Royal Rifles had served only in the Dominion of Newfoundland and New Brunswick, prior to posting to Hong Kong. The Winnipeg Grenadiers had been deployed to Jamaica. Few Canadian soldiers had field experience, but were nearly fully equipped. However, the battalions had only two anti-tank rifles, and no ammunition for 2-inch and 3-inch mortars or for signal pistols. These were intended to be supplied after they arrived in Hong Kong. Nor did C Force receive its vehicles, as the US merchant ship &quot;San Jose&quot; carrying them was, at the outbreak of the Pacific War, diverted to Manila, in the Philippine Islands, at the request of the US Government.

====Royal Navy====
The Royal Navy presence at Hong Kong was little more than a token display of defence, with three World War I vintage destroyers, four river gunboats, a new but almost unarmed minelayer and the 2nd Motor Torpedo Boat Flotilla.

====Royal Marines====
There were 40 Royal Marines attached to HMS &quot;Tamar&quot; (a shore station). When the battle began, the Royal Marines fought against Japanese forces in Magazine Gap, alongside HKVDC and Royal Engineers. They also manned machine guns on Mount Cameron. Commanding officer, Major Giles RM instructed his men to defend the island &quot;to the last man and last round&quot;.

====Royal Air Force====
The Royal Air Force station at Hong Kong&#x27;s Kai Tak Airport (RAF Kai Tak) had only five aeroplanes: two Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft and three out-dated Vickers Vildebeest torpedo-reconnaissance bombers, flown and serviced by seven officers and 108 airmen. An earlier request for a fighter squadron had been rejected and the nearest fully operational RAF base was in Kota Bharu, Malaya, nearly away.

====Other forces====
The Chinese Military Mission to Hong Kong, initiated in 1938, was headed by Rear Admiral Andrew Chan and his aide Lieutenant Commander Henry Hsu. It had the objective of co-ordinating Chinese war aims with the British in Hong Kong. Working with the British police, Chan organized pro-British agents among the population and rooted out triad factions that were sympathetic to the Japanese.

A squad of Free French under Captain Rodéric Egal, of the Free French in Shanghai who happened to be in Hong Kong when the battle broke out, fought alongside the HKVDC at the North Point power station. They were all World War I veterans (as were the local HKVDC) and acquitted themselves well.

==Battle==
===New Territories and Kowloon===
Defending the New Territories was the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots in the west, the 2/14th Punjab in the center and the 5/7th Rajput in the east. In front of them was a thin screen of 2/14th Punjab infantry supported by four Bren Gun Carriers and two armoured cars and engineers at Sheung Shui and Tai Po. At 04:45 on 8 December 1941 (Hong Kong Time), roughly 2.5 hours after the Attack on Pearl Harbor (which happened at 07:49 Hawaii Time or 02:19 Hong Kong Time the next day because of International Date Line) Radio Tokyo announced that war was imminent and General Maltby and Governor Young was informed. At 05:00 the engineers detonated their charges destroying bridges on likely invasion routes.

Japanese forces had been assembling north of the Sham Chun River since the beginning of December. The Japanese attack began at 06:00 when the IJA 230th, 229th and 228th Regiments (arranged from west to east) crossed the Sham Chun River. In the west the 230th Regiment advanced towards Yuen Long, Castle Peak Bay and Tai Mo Shan. In the center, the 229th Regiment advanced from Sha Tau Kok towards Chek Nai Ping and across Tide Cove to Tai Shui Hang. In the east, the 228th Regiment crossed at Lok Ma Chau and Lo Wu and advanced towards Lam Tsuen and Needle Hill.

At 08:00 the Japanese bombed Kai Tak Airport. Two of the three Vildebeest and the two Walruses were destroyed by 12 Japanese bombers. The attack also destroyed several civil aircraft including all but two of the aircraft used by the air unit of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps. The RAF and air unit personnel from then fought on as ground troops. The Pan-Am Airways flying boat &quot;Hong Kong Clipper&quot; was dive-bombed and destroyed. The Japanese also bombed Sham Shui Po Barracks causing minimal damage.

The first significant exchanges of fire were at 15:00 when the 2/14th Punjab engaged the IJA who had crossed into Laffan&#x27;s Plain. 2/14th Punjab eliminated several IJA platoons at 18:30 just south of Tai Po and HKVDC armoured cars and Bren Gun Carriers also successfully engaged IJA forces. Despite these successes, the 2/14th Punjab withdrew towards Grassy Hill in the afternoon to avoid being outflanked and the IJA forces advanced down the Tai Po Road towards Sha Tin. Late that night all units were ordered to withdraw to the Gin Drinker&#x27;s Line.

On 9 December the 2nd Royal Scots held in the west, a reserve company of the 5/7th Rajputs moved forward to Smuggler&#x27;s Ridge, the HKVDC held Fo Tan and the 2/14th Punjab held at Tide Cove. By 13:00 the IJA 228th Regiment had reached Needle Hill and its commander Colonel Doi was reconnoitring the Shing Mun Redoubt area of the Gin Drinker&#x27;s Line which he found to be unprepared for an attack. Despite the area being outside of his regimental boundary he developed an attack plan and began moving his men into position. The redoubt was defended by A Company, 2nd Royal Scots supplemented by other units giving a total strength of three officers and 39 soldiers. The defenders and the nearby D Company, 5/7th Rajputs conducted patrols north of the redoubt and around Needle Hill but failed to detect the two IJA battalions in the area or the 150-man attacking force which had crossed the Jubilee Dam and was in position just below one of the redoubt&#x27;s pillboxes. At 23:00 the defenders detected movement and opened fire as the IJA began their attack. As the Japanese progressively overran the complex of trenches and tunnels, many of the defenders found themselves locked in the redoubt&#x27;s artillery observation post (OP). Pillbox 402 was destroyed by IJA sappers at 02:30 on the 10th and the rest of the 3/228th Regiment joined the assault moving through the redoubt and into the valley, running into the 5/7th Rajputs who were moving to support the redoubt. The 5/7th Rajputs forced the Japanese back toward the redoubt. The Japanese eventually blew open the OP, capturing the 15 survivors. Artillery at Stonecutter&#x27;s Island and Mount Davis pounded the redoubt until 05:00, but apart from one position which held out until the afternoon the redoubt was lost. The IJA had only lost a mere two soldiers in the attack.

At 21:30 on the 9th and HMS &quot;Scout&quot; were ordered to leave Hong Kong for Singapore, successfully evading the IJN blockade. Only one destroyer, HMS &quot;Thracian&quot;, several gunboats and a flotilla of MTBs remained. Between 8 and 10 December, eight American plus a number of Chinese pilots of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and their crews flew 16 sorties between Kai Tak Airport and landing fields in Nanxiong and Chongqing (Chungking), the wartime capital of the Republic of China. The crew evacuated 275 people, including Mme Sun Yat-Sen, the widow of Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi.

On 10 December, the IJA 228th Regiment continued to move troops into the Shing Mun Redoubt while sending out small patrols along the rest of the line but otherwise failed to capitalize on their success. Maltby saw the loss of the redoubt as a disaster that undermined the entire defensive line and the 2nd Royal Scots were ordered to counterattack at dawn on the 11th, but their commander Lieutenant Colonel S. White refused on the basis that it had no chance of success.

At dawn on the 11th the IJA 228th Regiment attacked Golden Hill and was engaged by the 5/7th Rajputs supported by fire from HMS &quot;Cicala&quot;. D Company, 2nd Royal Scots counterattacked and regained the hill. At midday, Maltby having decided that the New Territories and Kowloon were untenable and that the defence of Hong Kong island was the priority, ordered the evacuation of all his forces. Demolition works were carried out and the 2nd Royal Scots and supporting forces withdrew south to Sham Shui Po Barracks and Jordan pier, while the 5/7th Rajputs withdrew to Ma Yau Tong where they would hold Devil&#x27;s Peak peninsula protecting the narrow Lye Moon Passage. The guns on Stonecutter&#x27;s Island were destroyed and the base was abandoned that night.

Also on the morning of the 11th, the IJA landed on Lamma Island and were engaged by guns of Jubilee Battery and Aberdeen Battery. That afternoon the Japanese attempted a landing near Aberdeen Island (Ap Lei Chau) but were driven off by machine gun fire.

The 2/14th Punjab were to join the Rajputs on the Ma Yau Tong line, but during their march on the night of 11/12, December became split up, with one group reaching the Devil&#x27;s Peak area while the other descended into Kai Tak and marched into Kowloon on the morning of the 12th, where they were engaged by the IJA 3/320th Regiment which had infiltrated into the area. The Punjabis fought their way down to Tsim Sha Tsui and were evacuated by Star Ferry. HMS &quot;Tamar&quot; was scuttled in the harbour to prevent its use by the Japanese. On the night of the 12th the 5/7th Rajputs withdrew from Ma Yau Tong further down the Devil&#x27;s Peak peninsula and at 04:00 on the 13th they began boarding boats to take them to Hong Kong island with the evacuation being completed by the morning of 13 December 1941.

===Hong Kong Island===

Maltby organized the defence of the island, splitting it between an East Brigade and a West Brigade. The West Brigade commanded by Brigadier John K. Lawson had its headquarters at the top of Wong Nai Chung Gap, a strategic passage between the north and south of the island. The West Brigade comprised the 2/14th Punjab covering the shoreline from Causeway Bay to Belcher&#x27;s Point; the Winnipeg Grenadiers defended the southwest corner of the island and Lawson&#x27;s headquarters; the Middlesex Regiment was dispersed across 72 pillboxes along the island shoreline; the 2nd Royal Scots reinforced by the HKVDC were held in reserve at Wanchai Gap; and the HKVDC had companies located at High West, Mt Davis, Pinewood Battery, Magazine Gap, Jardine&#x27;s Lookout and Aberdeen Naval Base. The East Brigade commanded by Brigadier Cedric Wallis had its headquarters at Tai Tam Gap. The East Brigade comprised the 5/7th Rajputs holding pillboxes along the northeast shoreline with a company and their headquarters in the hills behind Taikoo Dockyard and a reserve company in Tai Hang; the Royal Rifles of Canada defended the island&#x27;s northeast all the way around to Stanley; and two companies of the HKVDC were located at Tai Tam and Pottinger Gap.

On the morning of 13 December, a Japanese delegation crossed the harbour to offer terms of surrender, which were rejected. The Japanese then began an artillery bombardment of Hong Kong Island disabling one of the 9.2-inch guns on Mt Davis and hitting Belcher&#x27;s Fort in Pok Fu Lam. On the 14th Japanese artillery destroyed a 3-inch gun at Mt Davis. On the 15th Japanese artillery moved to target pillboxes and other defensive positions along the shoreline. The Japanese mounted six air attacks on positions on the west of the island and bomb damage forced the abandonment of Pinewood Battery.

On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese again offered terms of surrender which were rejected. That night a reconnaissance team from the IJA 3/229th Regiment successfully explored the Taikoo area. The IJA had moved its forces closer to Hong Kong Island with the 23rd Army headquarters at Tai Po and the 38th Division near Kai Tak.

On 18 December the Japanese bombardment of the island shoreline increased and the oil storage tanks were hit. The IJA forces were organized into two assault units: the west assault unit comprised the 228th and 230th Regiments and would leave from the Kai Tak area, and the east assault unit comprised the 229th Regiment (less 1/229th held as Divisional reserve) and would leave from the Devil&#x27;s Peak area. The attack order was issued at 18:00 and at 20:00 the first wave from the 2/228th and 3/230th began paddling towards the Taikoo Dockyard and sugar refinery under cover of artillery fire. As they approached the shore the boats were illuminated by searchlights and fired on by the 5/7th Rajputs. The boats scattered and both battalion commanders were wounded so Colonel Doi crossing with the second wave assumed command of the assault. At 21:40 the artillery barrage moved to targets further inshore and at 21:45 the 3/230th landed at North Point, followed by the 2/228th. At 21:38 the 2/229th landed at Sai Wan and the 3/229th landed at Aldrich Bay. By midnight all six IJA battalions were ashore but were held up on the beaches by barbed wire, fire from the 5/7th Rajputs and the general confusion of night operations. The Japanese eventually moved inshore overwhelming the Rajputs, bypassing or destroying the strong points as they generally headed towards the high ground. Maltby believing that the landing only comprised two battalions and was a diversion for a direct assault across the harbor on Victoria sent minimal reinforcements to block any IJA movement west towards Victoria and five HKVDC armored cars to protect the East Brigade headquarters. The 2/230th moved west towards Victoria but was stopped by an HKVDC, Free French and miscellaneous force in the North Point Power Station led by Major John Johnstone Paterson. Radioing for assistance, Maltby sent an HKVDC armoured car and a platoon from the 1st Middlesex, but they were ambushed on the way and only nine men made it to the station. The Japanese then directed artillery fire on the station and the surviving defenders withdrew at 01:45 continuing to fight the Japanese on Electric Road and King&#x27;s Road until all were killed or captured.

In the early hours of 19 December, the IJA 3/229th moved uphill towards Mt Parker, while the 2/229th moved southeast towards the Lyemun fortifications. The 2/229th engaged a platoon of the Royal Rifles sent to check on A Company of the Rajputs and then quickly overwhelmed the Fort&#x27;s garrison. The 2/229th then captured Sai Wan Battery killing six gunners from the HKVDC 5th Anti-Aircraft Battery and then proceeded to bayonet 20 prisoners, with only two surviving. The Royal Rifles attempted to retake the Victorian era Sai Wan Fort with two platoons but were unable to scale the walls and lost nine killed. A company from the 2/229th entered the Salesian Mission in Shau Kei Wan, which was being used as a dressing station and they proceeded to kill all those inside, however, four men survived. According to Captain Stanley Martin Banfill of the Royal Rifles, who witnessed his men being executed, the leading Japanese officer stated that &quot;Order is all captives must die&quot;. The rest of the 2/229th were engaged by C Company, Royal Rifles who inflicted heavy casualties, but the Japanese were able to move past the Canadian while also inflicting heavy losses forcing C Company to withdraw leaving only A Company on Mt Parker. At 03:00 a platoon from D Company was sent to reinforce Mt Parker, but they became lost in the dark and only arrived at 07:30 to find over 100 Japanese on Mt Parker and A Company withdrawing and so Mt Parker was abandoned to the Japanese. In addition to East Brigade&#x27;s infantry losses, the coastal batteries at Cape D&#x27;Aguilar and Cape Collinson were abandoned, while several of 965 Battery&#x27;s guns were destroyed in error or left to the Japanese. Wallis withdrew his headquarters from Tai Tam Gap to Stanley.

In the West Brigade area, Lawson sent three platoons from the Winnipeg Grenadiers forward to block the IJA advance from their landing sites, deploying one platoon on each of Jardine&#x27;s Lookout and Mt Butler and one forward on Wong Nei Chung Gap Road. Meanwhile, the 3/230th was advancing along Sir Cecil&#x27;s Ride on the side of Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, the 2/230th towards Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, the 2/228th advanced on the other side of Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, the 1/228th moved through Quarry Gap and the 3/229th advanced up Tai Tam Reservoir Road. The Japanese swept aside the weak infantry screens and while pillboxes inflicted casualties the Japanese were able to bypass such strong points and captured Jardine&#x27;s Lookout. At 06:20 Pillbox PB1 occupied by No. 3 Company, HKVDC fired on an estimated 400 IJA advancing along Sir Cecil&#x27;s Ride. Several IJA battalions advancing along the catchwaters captured the anti-aircraft positions on Tai Tam Reservoir Road east of Wong Nei Chung Gap, after a heavy firefight. In the early morning Lawson brought forward A Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers to recapture Jardine&#x27;s Lookout and they then successfully retook Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, but only for a couple of hours before the hill fell after an intense artillery bombardment and frontal assaults by IJA 230th and 228th Regiment. The IJA forces descended from Wong Nei Chung Reservoir and attacked the police station and Postbridge House at the summit of Wong Nei Chung Gap. By 07:00 the 3/230th closed in on the West Brigade headquarters, Maltby sent A Company, 2nd Royal Scots to reinforce them approaching Wong Nei Chung Gap Road, but only 15 men made it through while a group of sailors approaching from the south up Repulse Bay Road were also ambushed. The 3/230th cleared out positions south and east of the headquarters despite fire from HKSRA artillery in Happy Valley. At 10:00 Lawson radioed that his headquarters were surrounded and that he was &quot;going outside to shoot it out&quot;, he and his entire command group were then hit by Japanese machine gun fire from across the gap and Lawson died of blood loss the hill behind his bunker. By midday only elements of D Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers and British and Chinese engineers held positions above the West Brigade Headquarters, while Pillboxes PB 1 and PB 2 on the lower slopes of Jardine&#x27;s Lookout continued to resist.

At 08:45 six MTBs assembled off Green Island and then moved east in pairs into Hong Kong Harbour to attack boats transporting IJA soldiers across the harbour. As they neared Kowloon Bay MTB 7 attacked three Japanese boats, sinking two and damaging others before being disabled by Japanese fire and towed out by MTB 2. MTB 9 damaged a further four Japanese boats.

At 13:30 Maltby issued Operation Order No. 6 for a general counterattack to commence at 15:00. A and D Companies, 2/14th Punjab was to attack east towards North Point to relieve the HKVDC still holding out there, however, the order never reached them. Headquarters Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers, the rest of 2/14th Punjab and the 2nd Royal Scots were to attack east from Middle Gap towards Wong Nei Chung Gap, but the Royal Scots were late and so the HQ Company moved along the front of Mt Nicholson separately. D Company, 2nd Royal Scots and D Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers were then ordered to advance up Wong Nei Chung Gap Road but were hit by Japanese fire from Jardine&#x27;s Lookout and were pinned down for the rest of the day. By 18:00 PB1 and PB2 were abandoned. At 22:00 a Japanese counterattack on Mt Butler was repulsed by A Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers.

At 02:00 on the 20th the Royal Scots attacked the police station at the top of Wong Nei Chung Gap, but were repulsed as was another attack an hour later. An attack on Jardine&#x27;s Lookout by C Company, 2nd Royal Scots also failed. Maltby ordered the Headquarters Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers to advance on Wong Nei Chung Gap, but they suffered heavy casualties before being stopped 300m short of the road, they then moved back along Black&#x27;s Link and encountered approximately 500 unprepared Japanese and proceeded to attack them. At 15:00, after exhausting their ammunition, A Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers on Mt Butler surrendered to the Japanese, however in a final exchange of fire Sergeant-major John Robert Osborn smothered a Japanese grenade with his body, an action for which he was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. By 17:45 elements of the HKSRA under Major, Edward De Vere were ordered to attack the police station. The attack was launched at 22:00 supported by two armoured cars. This attack was successful and the unit managed to recapture the police station, but only for a few hours until the Japanese captured the police station using reinforcements from Stanley Gap (the old name for the Tai Tam Reservoir Road.)

The new West Brigade commander Colonel H.B. Rose of the HKVDC developed a plan to retake the Gap using the 2nd Royal Scots and the Winnipeg Grenadiers. B Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers was brought from Pok Fu Lam in the afternoon but was unable to locate the 2nd Royal Scots who had inexplicably moved off the eastern slopes of Mt Nicholson. This lapse allowed Colonel Doi to order three companies of the 1/228th to occupy Mt Nicholson in the afternoon under cover of a rain storm. B Company, Winnipeg Grenadiers moved in two columns in the dark and rain around the north and south of Mt Nicholson, meeting up above the gap which was to be their starting point for the next day&#x27;s attack. However, they were then engaged by the Japanese and all their officers and NCOs and 29 men became casualties and they retreated around the north of Mt Nicholson.

Elsewhere on the 20th, the 2nd and 3rd battalions, 229th Regiment had advanced down the Tytam Road and captured the X roads, Red Hill and Bridge Hill. They captured the 4.5-inch battery at Red Hill, which was abandoned the previous day. A handful of British civilians who were at the nearby pumping station were blindfolded and bayonetted at the beach in front of the pumping station. Meanwhile, the Japanese in the area south of Tai Tam Reservoir and into the hills above Repulse Bay where they encountered a company from the Royal Rifles and two HKVDC platoons preparing to attack Wong Hei Chung Gap from Violet Hill. Maltby sent A Company, 2/14th Punjab to support the forces in Repulse Bay, but they were engaged by a Japanese force on Shouson Hill and were forced to retreat with their commander Colonel Kidd killed in the action. Further east the 1/229th and 2/228th advanced from Tai Tam and Sai Wan towards Stanley. HMS &quot;Cicala&quot; which had been providing gunfire support in Deep Water Bay was hit by Japanese bombers and sank in the Lamma Channel.

At 09:15 on the 21st Wallis launched a new attack into Tai Tam to try to reach Wong Nei Chung Gap, with D Company, Royal Rifles, No. 1 Company, HKVDC, a medium machine gun section and two Bren Gun Carriers advancing from Stanley Mound. They were soon hit by Japanese mortar fire from Red Hill and then engaged by infantry from 1/229th and 1/230th on Bridge Hill and Red Hill. By 1400 hours, the Commonwealth forces managed to capture the summit of Bridge Hill, the X roads and the summit of Red Hill. The Japanese quickly rushed reinforcements from Tai Tam Gap, such as two Type 94 Tankettes. These tankettes were fired upon by a British machine gun on Bridge Hill, and the tankettes retreated to Tai Tam Gap. Even with this success, by 17:00 all the officers in the Commonwealth counterattacking force had been wounded and the force withdrew toward Stanley. On the north shore elements of the 230th Regiment pushed west reaching Victoria Park, while Japanese artillery bombarded HMS Tamar. Maltby ordered a further attack on Wong Nei Chung Gap by a force comprising four platoons, but when the commander saw the IJA forces in the area he cancelled the attack.

On the 22nd the 2/229th moved west from Shouson Hill and captured PB14 on the shore of Deepwater Bay from elements of the 1st Middlesex and then proceeded to behead all the prisoners. Two battalions of the 229th attacked the Repulse Bay Hotel while the 1/229th and 1/230th pushed the remnants of the East Brigade back into the Stanley peninsula. The East Brigade formed three defensive lines: the first line was composed of elements of the 1st Middlesex, three companies of the Royal Rifles and one company of the HKVDC supported by one 2-pounder gun; the second line at Stanley Village comprised two companies of the 1st Middlesex, a company of the HKVDC and the Stanley company of the HKVDC supported by two 18-pounder and 2-pounder guns; and at Stanley Fort were two HKVDC artillery batteries and two Royal Artillery batteries with two 18-pounder, two 3.7-inch and 9.2-inch and 6-inch coastal guns. On the north shore West Brigade forces struggled to hold the line from Causeway Bay, through Leighton Hill, Happy Valley and Mount Cameron down to Bennett&#x27;s Hill on the south of the island. At midday the Japanese attacked Stanley Mound and Sugarloaf Hill defended by units of the Royal Rifles, after repulsing several attacks, low ammunition forced the defenders to withdraw. The Japanese began their assault on the southern flank of Mt Cameron inflicting severe losses on B Company, 2/14th Punjab, but the penetration was stopped by a counterattack by B Company, 4/7th Rajputs. In the north, after an intensive artillery bombardment, the Japanese broke through the defensive line south of Leighton Hill at 22:00, forcing the defenders to start abandoning their positions and retreat west to avoid encirclement.

At 08:00 on the 23rd the 5/7th Rajputs fell back leaving the 1st Middlesex units on Leighton Hill isolated and the Japanese bombarded them with mortar fire. Meanwhile, the remaining defenders on the north shore retreated west to Mount Gough. With the main water reservoirs now controlled by the IJA and with artillery damage to pipes, water supplies began to run out.

On the 24th the Royal Rifles were withdrawn to the defensive lines at Stanley. The IJA forces attacked down the Tai Tam Road but were repulsed. A second attack began at 21:00 supported by three Type 94 tankettes, two of which were destroyed by a 2-pounder fire. The outer defensive line broke and No 2 Company HKVDC was forced back to Stanley Village with heavy losses. At midnight the Japanese penetrated the second defence line and entered the field hospital at St. Stephen&#x27;s College and in the St. Stephen&#x27;s College massacre tortured and killed a large number of injured soldiers, along with the medical staff. On the north shore the 230th Regiment advanced through Wanchai, meeting resistance at the China Fleet Club but this was soon overcome and the regiment advanced on the dockyard. In Happy Valley, the remnants of the 5/7th Rajputs were pushed back from the Happy Valley Racecourse, off Mount Parish and out of Wanchai Market.

===Fall of Hong Kong===

On Christmas morning, Young informed Chan of his intent to surrender. Chan intended to break out and was given command of the five remaining MTBs; 68 men, including Chan, Hsu, and David Mercer MacDougall were successfully evacuated to Mirs Bay where they contacted Nationalist guerrillas and were escorted to Huizhou. For this feat, Chan was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

By the afternoon of 25 December 1941, it was clear that further resistance would be futile and at 15:30 Governor Young and General Maltby surrendered in person to General Sakai at the Japanese headquarters on the third floor of the Peninsula Hotel. At Stanley, Wallis refused to surrender without a written order and this was received by him at 02:30 on the 26th. Isolated pockets held out even longer, and the Central Ordnance Munitions Depot (known as &quot;Little Hong Kong&quot;) surrendered on 27 December. This was the first occasion on which a British Crown Colony had surrendered to an invading force. The garrison had held out for 17 days. This day is known in Hong Kong as &quot;Black Christmas&quot;.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===

The Japanese officially reported 675 men killed and 2,079 wounded; western estimates go as high as 1,895 dead and 6,000 casualties overall. Allied casualties were 1,111 men killed, 1,167 missing and 1,362 wounded (sources vary; other figures given include 1,045 killed, 1,068 missing and 2,300 wounded, as well as 1,560 killed or missing). Allied dead, including British, Canadian and Indian soldiers, were eventually interred at Sai Wan Military Cemetery and the Stanley Military Cemetery. Total battle casualties of &quot;Indian Other Ranks&quot; is given to be 1164 out of a total of 3893 military personnel from India who were garrisoned in Hong Kong. The 5/7 Rajput bore the heaviest losses recorded amongst the 6 combat regiments during the battle of Hong Kong: 156 killed in action or died from wounds, 113 missing, and 193 wounded. The 2/14 Punjab had 55 killed in action or died from wounds, 69 missing, and 161 wounded. C Force casualties in the battle were 23 officers and 267 other ranks killed or died of wounds, including five officers and 16 other ranks of the brigade headquarters, seven officers and 123 men of the Royal Rifles and 11 officers and 128 men of the Winnipeg Grenadiers. C Force also had 28 officers and 465 men wounded. Some of the dead were murdered by Japanese soldiers during or after surrender. Japanese soldiers committed a number of atrocities on 19 December, when the aid post at the Salesian Mission near Sau Ki Wan was overrun. A total of 1,528 soldiers, mainly Commonwealth (predominantly Indians and Canadians), are either buried or commemorated there. There are also graves of other Allied combatants who died in the region during the war, including some Dutch sailors who were re-interred in Hong Kong after the war.

At the end of February 1942, the Japanese government stated that numbers of prisoners of war in Hong Kong were: British 5,072, Canadian 1,689, Indian 3,829, others 357, a total of 10,947. They were sent to:
* Sham Shui Po POW Camp
* Argyle Street Camp for officers
* North Point Camp primarily for Canadians and Royal Navy
* Ma Tau Chung Camp for Indian soldiers
* Yokohama Camp in Japan
* Fukuoka Camp in Japan
* Osaka Camp in Japan

Of the Canadians captured during the battle, 267 subsequently perished in Japanese prisoner of war camps, mainly due to neglect and abuse. In December 2011, Toshiyuki Kato, Japan&#x27;s parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs, apologised for the mistreatment to a group of Canadian veterans of the Battle of Hong Kong.

Civilians were interned at the Stanley Internment Camp. Initially, there were 2,400 internees although this number was reduced, by repatriations during the war. Interned persons who died and prisoners executed by the Japanese are buried in Stanley Military Cemetery.

===Massacres and other war crimes===
*An estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.

====Hong Kong Island====
*Three captured persons were executed at Quarry Bay, including a female air raid warden named Ada Baldwin who was with the local Air Raid Precautions (ARP).
*After the fall of the medical station near the West Brigade command post, ten stretcher bearers of the St. John Ambulance within the station were killed, as well as a policeman and a medic from the Royal Army Medical Corps.
*Four men of A Company Winnipeg Grenadiers were bayoneted after the battle at Jardine&#x27;s Lookout. One grenadier, Private Kilfoyle, was killed on the forced march to North Point, according to witnesses.
*Four men were killed in the so-called &quot;Black Hole of Hong Kong&quot;, a mess hut at the Wongneichong AA Battery, including two Canadian officers.
*In the evening of 18–19 December 1941, surrendered gunners of the 5th Battery, Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps (HKVDC) and 5th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment at Sai Wan AA Battery were murdered by Japanese soldiers of No. 6 Company, the 2nd Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. In total 28 are killed, some may have died in the fight for the position.
*In the morning of 19 December 1941, Japanese soldiers of the 2nd Battalion or 3rd Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment murdered medical personnel and wounded soldiers who were captured at Salesian Mission, which was used as an emergency hospital. The Japanese soldiers attempted to kill all male prisoners of wars and released two female nurses. In total 16 were killed.
*From 19 to 20 December 1941, surrendered British and Commonwealth soldiers from various units were kept in a small shed near the anti-aircraft gun battery without food, water, and medical assistance. They were hit by shells and some were killed as the result in Wong Nai Chung Gap. The Japanese troops responsible for this probably came from the 230th and 229th regiments. In total at least 16 were killed.
*Around thirty civilians of different ethnicities were massacred at No. 42 Blue Pool Road on 22 December. When the soldiers of the 230th Infantry Regiment entered Blue Pool Road from the south, they murdered civilians, including local businessmen Lam Ming-fan and three male relatives of his family, as well a number of Ministry of Finance officials of the Nationalist Chinese government who took refuge in the houses along the road. Tang Shiu-kin, a prominent businessman and philanthropist who was at the same spot, survived the massacre.
*On 23 December 1941, British and Commonwealth soldiers from various units, led by Lt. Col. Robert MacPherson, attempted to surrender but were killed by Japanese soldiers of the No. 6 Company, 2nd Battalion of the 229th Infantry Regiment at the Ridge in Repulse Bay. At least 47 were killed and most of the killed prisoners of war were wounded soldiers. Among the dead was Major Charles Sydney Clarke of China Command HQ, two men of the 12th and 20th Coastal Regiments of the Royal Artillery (RA), six men of the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) and two of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC), nineteen men of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) and three of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC) and fourteen men of the RASC Company of the HKVDC.
*On 23 December 1941, wounded soldiers from various units were bayoneted at Overbays by Japanese soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment; the Japanese troops also set fire on the building. The Japanese executed at least fourteen captives, men of the same units as at The Ridge but also including three Royal Rifles of Canada and an officer of the 1st Middlesex.
*Ride, who was present at the surrender, stated later that he saw fifty bodies lying by the road, including six Middlesex men among them. These men may have been some of those attached to the Hong Kong Chinese Regiment. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission report also states that five men of the Royal Air Force went missing near The Ridge on 20 December, perhaps captured and killed.
* On 23 December 1941, Canadian troops from A Company, Royal Rifles and troops from various units were murdered at Eucliff by soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment after surrender. At least 7 were killed.
*Six men of the Middlesex were killed defending PB 14 at Deepwater Bay Ride (Lyon Light). Most of them were killed after capture via beheading.
*Another 36 known victims cannot be placed precisely at one of the three locations (Ridge, Overbays, Eucliffe).
*In the evening of 24 December, Japanese soldiers of the 229th and 230th regiments stormed the Marynoll Mission position ; resistance continued until dawn. At least six officers and a number of other men were killed after capture at Maryknoll Mission. Four members of the 8th Coastal Regiment RA may have been killed here as well; estimates of the number of men murdered vary from 11 to 16.
*In the evening of 24 December 1941, soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 229th Regiment stormed the field hospital of St. Stephen&#x27;s College, murdering the medical personnel and the wounded soldiers. Nurses were raped and then murdered. This was the largest-scale war crime against the garrison during the battle.
*Twelve nurses were raped at the emergency hospital at Happy Valley racecourse on 25 December.
*From 25 to 28 December 1941, Japanese soldiers from various units (possibly include rear-area troops) looted and raped the civilians in Causeway Bay; they were sometimes stopped by Japanese Gendarmerie but there were not enough of them to stop the rampage.

====Kowloon====
* One private (John Payne) and an Australian was captured by the Japanese in Kowloon on 12 December and executed.

====New Territories====
* From 8–9 December 1941, Japanese soldiers from various units passed through the Fanling Orphanage and looted the place; nurses and amahs were raped and brutalized. At least one baby was killed during the process. The case, however, was not thoroughly investigated and the perpetuators were not identified and tried.

===Subsequent operations===

Isogai Rensuke became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong. This ushered in the three years and eight months of Imperial Japanese administration.

The 38th Infantry Division departed Hong Kong in January 1942. The Hong Kong Defence Force was established during the same month, and was the main Japanese military unit in Hong Kong throughout the occupation.

During the over three and a half years of occupation by the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated. The local population in the rural New Territories, a mix of Hakka, Cantonese and other Han Chinese groups, waged a guerrilla war with limited success. The resistance groups were known as the Gangjiu and Dongjiang forces. The Japanese razed several villages in reprisal; the guerillas fought until the end of the Japanese occupation. General Takashi Sakai, who led the invasion of Hong Kong and served as governor for some time, was tried as a war criminal and executed by a firing squad in 1946.
===Awards===
Battalions from both Indian Army regiments earned Battle Honours for the defence of Hong Kong. In his despatch, Major-General C. M. Maltby, wrote about the conduct of troops under his command in Hong Kong and mentions the 5/7 Rajput Regiment: &quot;This battalion fought well on the mainland and their repulse of the enemy attack on Devil&#x27;s Peak was entirely successful. The full force of the enemy&#x27;s initial attack on the island fell on this battalion and they fought gallantly until they had suffered heavy casualties (100% of British Officers and most senior Indian Officers being lost) and were run over&quot;.

* Gander was a Newfoundland dog posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal, the &quot;animals&#x27; Victoria Cross&quot;, in 2000 for his deeds in World War II, the first such award in over 50 years. He picked up a thrown Japanese hand grenade and rushed with it toward the enemy, dying in the ensuing explosion but saving the lives of several wounded Canadian soldiers.
* Colonel Lance Newnham, Captain Douglas Ford and Flight Lieutenant Hector Bertram Gray were awarded the George Cross for the gallantry they showed in resisting Japanese torture in the immediate aftermath of the battle. The men had been captured and were in the process of planning a mass escape by British forces. Their plan was discovered but they refused to disclose information under torture and were shot by firing squad.
*Captain Mateen Ansari of the 5/7th Rajput&#x27;s was awarded the George Cross &quot;for most conspicuous gallantry in carrying out hazardous work in a very brave manner&quot;. Despite numerous efforts by the Japanese to get him to renounce his allegiance to the British and assist them in spreading subversion amongst the Indian ranks held in Japanese POW camps (after the fall of the Colony), all efforts failed. Ansari was tortured and starved for over five months before being sentenced to death. He was executed by beheading on 20 October 1943.

==Commemoration==
The Cenotaph in Central commemorates the defence as well as war-dead from the First World War. The shield in the colonial Emblem of Hong Kong granted in 1959, featured the battlement design to commemorate the defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War. This Coat of Arms was in place until 1997, when it was replaced by the regional emblem. After the war, Lei Yue Mun Fort became a training ground for the British Forces until 1987, when it was vacated. In view of its historical significance and unique architectural features, the former Urban Council decided in 1993 to conserve and develop the fort into the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence.

The memorial garden at Hong Kong City Hall commemorates those who died in Hong Kong during World War II.

<text>Lionel Beaumaurice Clarke (1 December 1892 – 19 October 1916) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Clarke was born on the 5th Concession Road (Con 5 - Lot 10), near Waterdown, Ontario. He spent his early years in England, home of his parents Henry Trevelyan Clarke and Rosetta Caroline Nona Clarke, but returned and settled in Winnipeg in about 1903. 

When World War I started, he was working as a surveyor for the Canadian Northern Railway in the Canadian north. He returned to Winnipeg to enlist in the 27th Battalion, and after arriving in England in June 1915, transferred to the 2nd (Eastern Ontario Regiment) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, to be with his brother, Charles.

==Victoria Cross==
The main assault of the Battle of Flers-Courcelette was scheduled for 15 September 1916. Its objective was to occupy a chain of trenches between Martinpuich and Courcelette. On 1 September 1916, Clarke&#x27;s battalion was charged with capturing a 50-yard-long salient between the Canadian position at Mouquet Farm and Courcelette to the north.

On 9 September 1916, near Pozières, France, the first three companies of Clarke&#x27;s battalion went over the top, leaving the fourth in reserve. Clarke, an acting corporal at the time, was assigned to take a section to clear the enemy on the left flank to allow his company sergeant to build a fortified dugout that would secure the Canadian position once the salient was overrun. When his section reached the trench, it was so heavily defended that they had to battle their way through with hand grenades, bayonets and their rifles as clubs. Clarke was the only man left standing; the rest had either been killed or wounded.

At that time, about 20 Germans, including two officers, counter-attacked. Clarke advanced, emptying his revolver into their ranks. He then picked up two enemy rifles and fired those too. One of the officers attacked with a bayonet, wounding Clarke in the leg, but Clarke shot him dead. The Germans retreated, but Clarke pursued, shooting four more and capturing a fifth. In all, Clarke killed 19 of the enemy, capturing one.

The citation in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; reads: 
===Variation from &quot;The London Gazette&quot; citation===
The account in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; differed from the experiences related by Leo Clarke to his brother Charles (Charlie) while recuperating shortly after the events of 9 September 1916.

As an acting corporal, Clarke was not permitted to have, wear, or use a side-arm, however he had won a Colt Model 1905 Marine Corps and two extra magazines from a group of U.S. soldiers in a card game. As this sidearm was neither of British Expeditionary Force issue, nor sanctioned for use by infantrymen, it was neither referenced officially nor represented correctly in the tinplate engraving which accompanied the &quot;Gazette&quot; article—it was represented as a Webley Revolver (a British weapon).

The account in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; had Acting Corporal Clarke &#x27;advancing&#x27; however, per Clarke&#x27;s recounting to his brother, he held his position in the trench and while bracing himself against the side (as he still had a bayonet through his thigh), Clarke took steady aim and shot them dead one by one as the enemy rounded a turn some distance away—claiming one life for each of the 21 rounds he had. It was once his pistol was empty, he picked up a German rifle and proceeded down the trench and after making the turn where the Germans had come, he found several soldiers, a sergeant, and an officer. He demanded their surrender but the officer ordered the men to fight. Clarke shot him dead and the remaining soldiers surrendered. It was only after he returned to his own lines with the prisoners that he—and his prisoners—discovered that the rifle he carried was empty.

According to his brother Charles, the actions of the day (and the shooting one by one of the soldiers with the side-arm) troubled Leo deeply that &quot;The London Gazette&quot; account wasn&#x27;t challenged, but contributed to Clarke&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the honour. Charles Clarke completed an unpublished memoir (still in the hands of the Clarke family) which was a source for the 2014 book &quot;Valour Road&quot;.

==Death==

On 11 October 1916, Sergeant Clarke&#x27;s battalion was ordered forward to secure the newly captured Regina Trench which was under heavy enemy artillery fire. Clarke was crouching in a hole at the rear of a trench when a shell exploded and the back of the trench caved in, burying him. His brother dug him out, but Clarke was paralyzed; the weight of the earth had crushed his back and injured his spine. 

Clarke was taken to No. 1 General Hospital at Étretat but died on 19 October. He is buried in Plot II, Row C, Grave 3A, in Etretat Churchyard, 16 miles north of Le Havre, France. According to a contemporary newspaper article, shortly before his death he wrote to his parents, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t care so much for the Victoria Cross as getting home for a couple of months.&quot;

==Legacy==
Clarke was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross in February 1917. Clarke’s father, Henry, received his son’s VC at a presentation at the corner of Portage and Main in Winnipeg. For the first time, the Governor General of Canada, the Duke of Devonshire, travelled to make a personal presentation of the award at a ceremony attended by about 30,000 people. Henry Clarke also received a letter from King George V, commending his son for his courageous actions.

In 1925, Pine Street in West End, Winnipeg, was renamed Valour Road in honour of Clarke and fellow Victoria Cross winners Frederick William Hall and Robert Shankland, all of whom lived on the 700 block.

A plaque in his honour was erected by the Ontario Heritage Foundation at the Royal Canadian Legion branch in Waterdown.

Clarke&#x27;s story was featured in a Heritage Minutes vignette, which was run nationally in Canada.

The legacy of remembrance continues in the Clarke family as Charles Clarke (brother of Leo) named his eldest son Lionel after his late brother and the family has continued to honour this memory with the great-nephew and great-great nephew carrying this name as well.

In 2010, the eldest son of Charles Clarke (nephew and namesake Leo Charles Clarke), with the support of the family, donated the Victoria Cross and the Colt sidearm to the Canadian War Museum. This was donated in memory of both his Uncle Leo and his father Charles Clarke. By 2014, the museum had acquired all three Valour Road Victoria Cross medals and they are now on permanent display at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa.

Valour FC, a Canadian Premier League club, referenced Leo Clarke and two other Victoria Cross recipients from Winnipeg as inspiration to their club name.

<doc id="1160260" wikidata="Q391206" url="?curid=1160260" title="American Life">
<text>American Life is the ninth studio album by American singer Madonna. It was released on April 21, 2003, by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. The album, produced by the singer and Mirwais Ahmadzaï, features references to many parts of American culture. The album is a concept album, with themes panning the American Dream and materialism. These themes reject the reputation Madonna held in the 1980s, earned by her 1984 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-two hit, &quot;Material Girl&quot;. &quot;American Life&quot; is a folktronica and eurotechno album, influenced by acoustic music.

&quot;American Life&quot; initially received mixed reviews upon release; critics found the album confusing and &quot;about Madonna&quot;. Critics also found it &quot;difficult to listen to&quot; due to its awkward and brash production in some songs. However, retrospective reviews of the album have been much more positive, particularly noting its lyrical depth. &quot;American Life&quot; reached number one in 14 countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, and also charted within the top-five of most markets. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) both certified the album Platinum in recognition of one million shipments in the United States, and 300,000 shipments in the United Kingdom, respectively. It became the 32nd best-selling album of 2003 and has sold five million copies worldwide. &quot;American Life&quot; garnered two nominations at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004.

Four singles were released from &quot;American Life&quot;. The title track was released as the lead single to a generally negative critical reception, with &quot;Blender&quot; naming it the ninth worst song of all time. It charted at number 37 in the United States, while it entered the top-ten in most markets, peaking at number two in the United Kingdom. A controversial music video was pulled after scenes of war and violence were criticized which led to an edited version being released. Its following single, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, became her first single not to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since 1983. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, the third and fourth singles respectively, featured a lack of promotion resulting in poor commercial performances. Despite this, all singles peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart. Preceding the album release, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was released as a single to promote the James Bond film of the same name, and peaked at number eight on the US Hot 100 and number three on the UK Singles Chart.

Madonna promoted the album during a small promotional tour in April and May 2003. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, she performed alongside Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott a medley of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;, and engaged in open-mouth kissing with Aguilera and Spears gaining great controversy and publicity. &quot;American Life&quot; was supported by Madonna&#x27;s sixth tour, the Re-Invention World Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2004 earning $125 million. The tour was chronicled in the documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell You a Secret&quot;, which led to Madonna&#x27;s first-ever live album of the same name.

== Background and development ==
During the early 1990s, Madonna had focused on a number of provocative releases, like the erotic pictorial book &quot;Sex&quot;, the sadomasochist inspired album &quot;Erotica&quot;, and the erotic thriller, &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;, all of which she deduced was due to &quot;a lot of rage and anger&quot; within herself. However, by the beginning of the new millennium, Madonna was living a calmer, more introspective and wholesome life with her husband Guy Ritchie, their son Rocco, and Madonna&#x27;s daughter Lourdes from a previous relationship. According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, the presence of Ritchie in Madonna&#x27;s life had a calming effect on the singer, making her more matured and easing her temper. Concentrating on her music career, Madonna was busy throughout 2001 on her Drowned World Tour. On September 11, 2001, suicide bombers hijacked two jet airliners and crashed into the World Trade Center, resulting in the death of nearly 3,000 people. The event had a profound effect on American society, with the cultural mood being bleakness and paranoia. People, including Madonna, started asking questions about their culture and the American Dream, which had been a long-lasting ideal for many. When Madonna started working on her ninth studio album, &quot;American Life&quot;, she wanted answers to her queries and an appropriate response to the 9/11 disaster and the ensuing Iraq war of 2003. She believed that the ensuing months with the war would lead to a politically charged atmosphere throughout the country, and wanted to express that in the record.

Like her 2000 studio album, &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna enlisted the help of French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. &quot;We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together,&quot; said Madonna, adding &quot;It is another step on, but I&#x27;ve never wanted to repeat myself. I don&#x27;t ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice.&quot; &quot;American Life&quot; became Madonna&#x27;s final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled &quot;Madonna Speaks&quot;, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind &quot;American Life&quot;, about &quot;material things&quot; being unimportant. &quot;I have lots of &#x27;material&#x27; things and I&#x27;ve had lots of beliefs about things and what&#x27;s important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that a lot of things that I&#x27;d valued weren&#x27;t important&quot;, she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told &quot;Q&quot; magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.

== Writing and inspiration ==
When Madonna started writing the songs on the album, she was inspired by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on &quot;American Life&quot; and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told &quot;Q&quot; magazine that the &quot;music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books&quot;. Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï&#x27;s downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. &quot;American Life&quot; was deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt &quot;like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame just for the sake of fame, no matter what — sell your soul to the devil if that&#x27;s what it takes. And we&#x27;re also completely obsessed with the way we look.&quot; Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Stupid&quot;. John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna&#x27;s reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could come out of that &quot;illusion&quot;. Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying:

&quot;Who better to say those things don&#x27;t matter than somebody who&#x27;s experienced them? [People may say], &#x27;How can you say they don&#x27;t matter? How can you say that money won&#x27;t bring you happiness if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money? How can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life?&#x27; You have to have that experience to know. &#x27;Cause you have all those things, I&#x27;ve had all those things, and I&#x27;ve had nothing but chaos around me. So I&#x27;m just sharing what I know with the world. &#x27;Cause I do think that we&#x27;ve become completely consumed with being rich and famous, our society has. And I just want to tell people, take it from me, I have all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness.&quot;

The glamorous world of Hollywood also reflected in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that &quot;in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself.&quot; The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate on the things that did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on &quot;American Life&quot; also deal with issues close to the singer&#x27;s heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track &quot;Mother and Father&quot;. When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was &quot;a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on.&quot; According to Lucy O&#x27;Brien, author of &quot;&quot;, another concept of &quot;American Life&quot; was about &quot;nothingness&quot;. This was evident in the titles of the songs like &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;, usage of &quot;no&quot; in &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, as well as &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;. Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people&#x27;s assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, along with tracks &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;X-Static Process,&quot; became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of &quot;American Life&quot;. The track is followed by the folk-inspired &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;X-Static Process,&quot; both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track &quot;Easy Ride,&quot; which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.

== Recording and mixing ==
The album was mostly composed and entirely produced by Madonna and Ahmadzaï. Both had previously collaborated on Madonna&#x27;s studio album &quot;Music&quot; (2000). The recording sessions for &quot;American Life&quot; started in late 2001, then was put on hold as Madonna filmed &quot;Swept Away&quot; on location in Malta and Sardinia and starred in the West End play &quot;Up for Grabs&quot;. She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios and Sarm West Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions in London and Los Angeles in early 2003. For the instrumentation featured in some of the songs, Ahmadzaï played the guitars, and Stuart Price played the piano. Tom Hannen and Simon Changer, both of them worked as assistant engineer during the recording.
Unlike &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï also as a songwriter on &quot;American Life&quot; hence what transpired was Madonna&#x27;s wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained that there are some influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept &quot;might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, there is a lot of technology underneath&quot;. This approach was an imperative for &quot;American Life&quot;. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï&#x27;s own gear along with the studio&#x27;s SSL mixing consoles, the album&#x27;s recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to &quot;Remix&quot; magazine that they &quot;tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio.&quot;

&quot;American Life&quot; is suffused with Ahmadzaï&#x27;s characteristic production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments that make the music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it to create a new groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in &quot;American Life&quot;, where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. &quot;Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, &#x27;OK, let me just talk about the things that I like&#x27;. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous,&quot; she added.
For &quot;Hollywood&quot;, he used a drum kit and percussion from an E-mu Emulator and also added extra drum sounds to give the song an old, disco vibe. Wanting to have a loud bass synth sound, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer with lot of filtering manipulations. But he faced problems with it, so he used a Yamaha O2R mixer. He did not want &quot;Hollywood&quot; to sound like the music being played at the nightclubs, so he recorded Madonna&#x27;s vocals with heavy compression in her headphones. Two machines were used for the vocal editing in &quot;Hollywood&quot;. Madonna preferred the Antares Auto-Tune plug in, while Ahmadzaï chose an AMS pitch shifter. Madonna wanted Auto-Tune because she wanted &quot;Hollywood&quot; to have a more dance-like feel to it, although Ahmadzaï was against it. The track &quot;I&#x27;m So Stupid&quot; had gentle vocals, then the singing was frozen using a Roland VP-9000. When Madonna sings &quot;Aaaaaahhhhhh&quot;, the vocals freeze and the process sounds natural, but in reality is not. When it came to adding the beats, he experimented by programming the drums in Logic Pro and changing the timing of the beats. The producer combines different samples of songs from his own collections and keeps on trying until something new is developed. The mixing for the tracks was done by Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent at the Westlake Recording Studios at West Hollywood, California, while Tim Young did the mastering of the songs at Metropolis Studios in London. Michael Colombier did the string arrangement with Geoff Foster acting as the strings engineer, conducting at AIR Studios.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani stated that &quot;Madonna couldn&#x27;t possibly have intended to make a pop album. &quot;American Life&quot; is a folk album in the purest definition of the term—and it&#x27;s reflected right in the title&quot; and added that it has &quot;an often ugly, lo-fi demo quality.&quot; Greg Kot from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the record an &quot;electro-folk album&quot; with electronic beats and synthetic burps. Priya Elan of &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;folktronica&quot;, while Ben Ratliff, in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;diluted Eurotechno.&quot; Jon Pareles, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, characterized the album&#x27;s sound as a &quot;mixture of acoustic guitar-picking, ticking drum machines and swooping, buzzing synthesizer lines&quot;, adding that &quot;The guitar signals the sincerity of a singer-songwriter, while all the gizmos add the retro catchiness of the synth-pop music now being revived under the name electroclash.&quot; &quot;American Life&quot;, the title track, is the first song on the record. Starting with Madonna&#x27;s multi-tracked voice questioning, &quot;Am I gonna be a star&quot;, &quot;should I change my name&quot;, the lyrics then develop into what Rikky Rooksby of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot; states as a complaint about modern-day life. The lyrics accompany a &quot;punchy octave synth figure&quot; synchronized with a drum and bass beat. After three minutes of the song, Madonna performs a rap naming the people who were working for her. The second track and single &quot;Hollywood&quot; is introduced with sounds of tweeting birds, before an acoustic guitar starts with a four chord sequence that has been compared to songs by the band Red Hot Chili Peppers. The texture grows with addition of drums and synths, until after a minute the instrumental is pulled out, leaving just Madonna&#x27;s vocals and the acoustic guitar accompaniment where she alludes to the Beatles&#x27; Norwegian Wood. During the final sequence, Madonna raps, as is featured in the first song, with the repeated phrase &quot;Push the button&quot;. Lyrically, like the first track, it discusses American culture and greed focusing on Hollywood, California, as a place of stars and illusory dreams.
The next track &quot;I&#x27;m So Stupid&quot; features an introduction with a two-chord electric guitar which leads to a minor drum beat, with the guitar later changing to a three-chord. The composition throughout is generally minor, but at the 2:15 mark, different pitched synths change manically, and towards the end the synths become less prominent as the guitars become the main focus. Lyrically, the song expresses disillusionment with Madonna singing &quot;I used to live in a fuzzy dream&quot; and &quot;It was just greed&quot;, also proclaiming that once she was &quot;stupider than stupid&quot; before stating &quot;Everybody&#x27;s stupid&quot; towards the end of the song. The fourth track &quot;Love Profusion&quot; starts with another acoustic guitar introduction, with rhythm being produced by a bass drum with synth-strings added later in the song. Vocally, the line &quot;I got you under my skin&quot; is repeated, while a male voice acts as the backing for the track as the final words, &quot;feel good&quot;, are performed with no backing instrumental. &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; is the fifth track, featuring vocoder treated vocals. The song is accompanied by bleeping synths and a heavy drum part. The title is repeated throughout the song as she references &quot;social disease&quot; which is also repeated. A recurring theme of &quot;American Life&quot; is the acoustic guitar introduction to the songs, and is yet again featured in the sixth track &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;. The guitar is accompanied by a &quot;light&quot; drum section and low-pitched vocals from Madonna. The song also features a cello in the first part, and a church choir in the second part. Lyrically, the song discusses a lover who is the one, and how their meeting was not just chance. A reference to the &quot;tree of life&quot; is made during the song as Madonna states &quot;I&#x27;m not religious&quot; but she wishes to pray.

Acoustic guitars introduces the seventh track, &quot;Intervention&quot;. It starts with a three chord minor sequence which changes to a four chord one during the chorus section and a bass section starts at the end of the track. Lyrically, the song is an optimistic track about how a relationship will last as Madonna says &quot;the road looks lonely but that&#x27;s just Satan&#x27;s game&quot;. &quot;X-Static Process&quot;, the eighth track, starts once again with acoustic guitars and throughout there are vocal harmony lines in addition to an organ part. Lyrically, like the title track, it questions modern life as Madonna sings &quot;Jesus Christ will you look at me, don&#x27;t know who I&#x27;m supposed to be&quot;. &quot;Mother and Father&quot; is the album&#x27;s ninth track, with a drum and bass beat paired with an electric guitar present in the instrumental. Lyrically, the song reflects on Madonna&#x27;s childhood including her mother&#x27;s death and her father&#x27;s reaction, and the effect on their relationship. The tenth track is &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, the theme to the James Bond film of the same name which featured dominating string and synth parts. The eleventh and final track on the album, &quot;Easy Ride&quot;, is a heavily string-oriented song. It addresses Madonna&#x27;s feelings towards old age, wanting to live forever, and coming full circle to a point in her life where she could be comfortable.

== Artwork ==
By 2003, Madonna suggested that she was in a revolutionary mood, which led to journalistic discussions that another image makeover would take place for her. Still recovering from the commercial disappointment of &quot;Swept Away&quot;, Madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter, with inspirations from pictures of Argentinian guerrilla leader Che Guevara. French design team M/M Paris (Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak) were responsible for the artwork of &quot;American Life&quot;. The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and Madonna hired the duo after discussing the concept for just six minutes. The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles, and cost a reported $415,000. McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine in October 2002; this shoot had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark green and black clothes, combat boots, and guns.

As with 1989&#x27;s album &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s hair was dyed dark brown to signify &quot;seriousness&quot;, and on the cover of the album Madonna wore a beret, referencing &quot;Guerrillero Heroico&quot;, a famous image of Guevara. In an interview with &quot;Veja&quot; magazine, she described Guevara as &quot;an icon instantaneously identified with a revolution spirit. That goes for the whole album: the current moment, I feel a revolutionary state of mind&quot;. Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández wrote in his book, &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations&quot;, that the inclusion of Guevara as an inspiration for the cover was one of the many instances of Madonna incorporating Hispanic identity and the Latino subculture in her work. The album cover was also compared to an infamous 1970s photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress, Patty Hearst. The cover also had military styled stenciled lettering. The title &quot;American Life&quot; is written in blood red color and has a punk rock style. Inside the CD booklet, she wielded an Uzi submachine gun, her body in various martial art poses, spelling out her name. By late 2003, she had wiped out the military image completely, and followed with another subtle toned-down image of that of a writer and philanthropist.

== Title and release ==
In an interview with Larry King in October 2002, she said that she wanted to give the album a Hebrew name. Madonna then considered &quot;Ein Sof&quot;, which means endlessness, as a possible title for the album. However, as the months went on and the album became more of a meditation on the difficulty of leading a spiritual life in the glamour industry, the title was changed to &quot;Hollywood&quot; with Madonna saying that it was &quot;a reflection of my state of mind and a view of the world right now&quot;. Still, she was not satisfied with the name, and finalized on &quot;American Life&quot;.

&quot;American Life&quot; is Madonna&#x27;s second album to bear a &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; label after &quot;Erotica&quot; (1992), due to the profanity used in the title song. The album was released in the United States on April 22, 2003 and eight months later, Warner Music France released a box set version containing both the album and the remix collection, &quot;Remixed &amp; Revisited&quot;, in a cardboard sleeve entitled &quot;Édition Spéciale 2CDs: American Life + Remixed &amp; Revisited&quot;. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Madonna announced the release of an exclusive Record Store Day remixed EP of the album on April 22, 2023, in memory of Peter Rauhofer. A portion of the proceeds from this sale were given to charities specialising in brain cancer research.

To counter illegal downloads of the album, Madonna&#x27;s associates created a number of false MP3 files of similar length and size. Some delivered a brief message from Madonna saying &quot;What the fuck do you think you&#x27;re doing?&quot; followed by minutes of silence. Madonna&#x27;s website was hacked and the hacker added a message appearing on the main page, saying &quot;This is what the fuck I think I&#x27;m doing...&quot; followed by download links for each of the album&#x27;s songs. The website was closed after the attack for about 15 hours. Liz Rosenberg, Madonna&#x27;s spokesperson, told The Smoking Gun that the defacement was not a marketing ploy. The hack was linked to Phrack, an online hacker magazine, but Phrack representatives denied knowledge. The hacked page also contained a derogatory reference to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the federal law aimed at cracking down on digital and online piracy. In addition, the page included an impromptu marriage proposal to Morgan Webb, the host of the daily technology show &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;.

== Promotion ==
=== Live performances ===

To start marketing the album, Madonna embarked on a promotional tour across the United States and Europe. One of these performances, presented at the &quot;Total Request Live&quot; studios in New York, was shown by MTV in a special named &quot;Madonna on Stage &amp; on the Record&quot;. Hosted by Carson Daly, she sang songs from the album and answered questions from the audience. Madonna also performed at the HMV store on Oxford Street, London to 500 people. While in the United Kingdom, she performed &quot;American Life&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; at BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Another performance on Tower&#x27;s Fourth Street in Manhattan was presented to around 400 people. A stage was built in preparation for the performances with long dark drapes and large speakers, and according to &quot;Billboard&quot; was so that over one thousand fans nearby could hear the performance. She also performed a private concert in Paris, France, at restaurant Cantine du Faubourg to people who won tickets on a promotion hosted by NRJ Radio, and also some of her French friends including designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, director Luc Besson and producer Ahmadzaï.

On August 27, 2003, Madonna opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards with American recording artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, performing a medley of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;. American rapper Missy Elliott also performed her song &quot;Work It&quot; halfway through the performance. After &quot;Hollywood&quot; was performed by Madonna, she engaged in kissing with both Spears and Aguilera becoming an infamous moment for all three acts and in television history. In 2003, Madonna planned to release a special commemorative box set to celebrate her 20th anniversary in the music business and the release of her first studio album, &quot;Madonna&quot;, in 1983. The plan for the box set was eventually cancelled and &quot;Remixed &amp; Revisited&quot; was released in its place. The compilation contains remixed versions of four songs from &quot;American Life&quot; and a previously unreleased song called &quot;Your Honesty&quot;.

=== Singles ===

Preceding the album release, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was released as a single to promote the twentieth James Bond film of the same name. The song peaked at number eight in the United States, and number three in the United Kingdom. The production costs for the music video were over six million dollars, making it the third most expensive music video ever made, after &quot;Work Bitch&quot; by Britney Spears, and &quot;Scream&quot; by Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson.

&quot;American Life&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on April 8, 2003 in the United States and on April 14, 2003 in Europe. &quot;Blender&quot; magazine listed the song as the ninth worst song ever. There are two music videos. The first version is based on a fashion runway, with extras including children dressed in provocative war inspired outfits. The scene descends into violence and fighting to which the audience find amusement. At the end of the music video, then-President of the United States, George W. Bush is portrayed by a lookalike lighting a cigar. The anti-war content of its music video was interpreted as being unpatriotic, making Madonna withdraw its release from American music channels. She also released a statement saying she did so because she believed it was not appropriate to air it at that time, and that she did not want to risk offending anyone who could misinterpret its meaning. A second video was produced, showing Madonna donning military clothing and singing in front of the various flags of the world. The song debuted at number ninety on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and peaked at number thirty-seven on the chart, becoming Madonna&#x27;s 45th Top 40 hit in the chart. The song also peaked at number two in the UK, seven in Austria and Australia, and ten in France and Germany.

The second single, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, released on July 3, 2003 in Europe and July 8, 2003 in the US, failed to chart in the Hot 100, becoming Madonna&#x27;s first single in twenty years not to do so since &quot;Burning Up&quot; (1983). The song was a top five hit in Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Nothing Fails&quot; was released in October 26, 2003 as the third single, and backed with remixes of &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;. It was a minor chart success, but did not match the success of previous singles from &quot;American Life&quot;, charting outside the top twenty in some countries. It peaked in the top ten in Canada and Spain. In late 2003, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; was remixed as &quot;Nothing Fails (Nevins Mix)&quot; for Madonna&#x27;s remix EP &quot;Remixed &amp; Revisited&quot;.

&quot;Love Profusion&quot;, was the fourth and final single from the album, released on December 8, 2003. It peaked in the top ten only in Greece and Canada, her fifth top ten Canadian hit from the album and thirteenth top ten in-a-row. Also, it debuted and peaked at eleven on UK Singles Chart, becoming Madonna&#x27;s fifth single, of fifty-six, to miss the top ten on that chart, and first since &quot;One More Chance&quot; (1996).

The promotional releases, &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; and &quot;Mother and Father&quot;, became very successful in American clubs, peaking at number four and number nine, respectively, on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;American Life&quot; became the first album to achieve seven top ten songs on this chart.

=== Tour ===

In 2003, Madonna collaborated with photographer Steven Klein for an art installation project called &quot;X-Static Process&quot;. The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices – from yogi, prophet, queen to freak and pole dancer. The publication was a worldwide success, leading to a number of exhibitions in New York, London, Paris, Düsseldorf, Berlin and Florence. After the exhibition was over, Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task. She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re-Invention World Tour. The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project. It featured Madonna in a seventeenth-century-style dress, crawling on all fours towards the camera. The central theme of the show was unity versus violence. It was divided into five acts with different themes: &quot;French Baroque-Marie Antionette&quot; Revival, &quot;Military-Army&quot;, &quot;Circus-Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Acoustic&quot; and &quot;Scottish-Tribal&quot; segments. During the Q Awards, Elton John accused Madonna for lip-synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna&#x27;s representatives. Although musician Prince&#x27;s Musicology Live 2004ever tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004, &quot;Billboard&quot; Boxscore published that the Re-Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $125 million. At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards, Re-Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna&#x27;s tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award. A documentary, titled &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell You a Secret&quot;, which chronicled the tour, was released in 2005.

== Critical reception ==

Upon its release, &quot;American Life&quot; faced favorable to mixed reviews from music critics, holding a score of 60/100 on music review website Metacritic, based on 17 professional reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as &quot;Ray of Light&quot; positively, saying &quot;&quot;American Life&quot; relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman-in-the-mirror confrontation.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker generally responded well, saying that at its best, the album offers blunt, questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna sounding like a girl who&#x27;s grown content with her husband and kids and the ability to hire help to do her bidding. Dimitri Ebrlich of &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine gave a positive review for &quot;American Life&quot;, saying that Madonna &quot;stayed still&quot; in the album, and commenting that &quot;This may be the first time Madonna hasn&#x27;t pushed herself to explore new ground, but at least she&#x27;s chosen a good place to rest.&quot; Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the album a mixed review, stating that &quot;American Life&quot; is not a &quot;masterpiece&quot; compared to her 1992 studio album, &quot;Erotica&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s frequently self-indulgent, misguided, unpleasant, difficult to listen to, silly and humorless, but it&#x27;s also consistent, uncompromising and unapologetic,&quot; Cinquemani opined, ending with the deduction that &quot;American Life&quot; stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit.

Giving the album three out of five stars, Ben Ratliff from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; summarized that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from &quot;NME&quot; gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna&#x27;s previous endeavors like &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that &quot;American Life&quot; is better for what it promises than what it delivers, and that it is better in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from &quot;Blender&quot; awarded the album three stars out of five. &quot;Just as disjointed as &quot;Music&quot; and much more severe ... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished&quot;. Dorian Lynskey from &quot;Q&quot; magazine also rated it three out of five, stating &quot;&#x27;Nothing Fails&#x27;, the album&#x27;s centerpiece, is as good a showstopper as &#x27;Live to Tell&#x27; ... [but] it&#x27;s no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused&quot;.

Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Madonna tried to be honest with the concept of American Dream in the album, but ended up producing songs akin to the &quot;folkie psychobabble&quot; of songwriters like Jewel. James Hannaham from &quot;Spin&quot; compared the album&#x27;s introspective themes to her previous albums &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; and also noted Madonna spends much of &quot;American Life&quot; bemoaning the emptiness of celebrity culture. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; responded well to parts of the record saying &quot;&quot;American Life&quot;″s best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music&quot; however his conclusive point in the review was that there was not enough of good songs. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Jessica Winter called Madonna&#x27;s voice &quot;redundant&quot; and commented that &quot;she ironizes &#x27;the American dream&#x27; only to pitch woo at her English husband and articulate a vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in the world&quot;. Ed Howard from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; gave the album a negative review calling the album &quot;about Madonna&quot; instead of American culture explaining, &quot;it&#x27;s Madonna who, surprisingly, has simply run out of things to say&quot;. BBC&#x27;s Ian Young also gave a negative review, saying that &quot;the tunes are bland and weak, the lyrics are uninspired and self-absorbed and the semi-Ibiza backing music is bare and recycled—and we are convinced that she has lost it.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==

After its release, &quot;American Life&quot; debuted at number one on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with 241,000 copies sold in its first week. The sales were less than Madonna&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;Music&quot;, which debuted with 420,000 copies in 2000, but was the only one that week to sell over 200,000 copies. It was Madonna&#x27;s second consecutive number one debut, and her fifth number one album overall in the US. The next week, sales dropped by 62% to 91,000 copies, and the album slid from the top of the chart to number eight. It continued to decrease in sales down the chart and fell off the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In September 2003, following Madonna&#x27;s performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, the album saw a sales gain of 19%, but did not chart back. On July 7, 2003, just months after the release, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying shipment of one million copies in the US alone. However, it became the fourth lowest selling studio album by Madonna behind her 2012 release &quot;MDNA&quot;, her 2015 release &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; and her 2019 release &quot;Madame X&quot;, with sales of 680,000 copies as of October 2012, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It ranked at number 125 on the year-end ranking of the albums by &quot;Billboard&quot;. In Canada, the album debuted at the top of the Canadian Albums Chart with sales of 18,000 copies on May 10, 2003. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the sum was considerably less than her previous studio efforts, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) and &quot;Music&quot; (2000), which debuted with 59,000 and 50,000 copies respectively. It gained a Platinum certification one month later from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for shipment of 100,000 copies of the album.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;American Life&quot; debuted atop the UK Albums Chart, with sales of 65,013 copies, much less than the opening sum of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Music&quot;, which debuted with sales of 151,891 copies. The next week, it was pushed down to the third position, by Justin Timberlake&#x27;s album, &quot;Justified&quot;, and The White Stripes album, &quot;Elephant&quot;. It continued its downward movement, falling to number five in its third week on the chart and was out of the top ten by its fifth week. It was present for a total of 19 weeks on the chart, ranking at number 52 on the UK year-end tally. &quot;American Life&quot; sold 335,115 copies by July 2008 and earned a Platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In European countries, the album topped the charts in Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Belgium (Wallonia), Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) awarded &quot;American Life&quot; Platinum certification, signifying sales of over one million copies across Europe. The album also gained Platinum certifications in countries such as France, Russia, and Switzerland, and Gold certifications in Brazil, Greece, and the Netherlands.

In Japan, the album peaked at number four on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart remaining there for 13 weeks, and went on to gain a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) that same year, for shipping 100,000 copies of the release. In Australia the album peaked at number three, before descending rapidly down the ARIA Albums Chart. Nevertheless, it gained a Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipping 70,000 copies. Overall, &quot;American Life&quot; became the 32nd bestselling album of 2003, and sold five million copies worldwide.

== Legacy ==
&quot;American Life&quot; achieved an impact in the Internet culture of the time; it sparked debate according to Lynette Holloway from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In &quot;Branding Unbound&quot; (2005), Rick Mathieson explained the album was promoted in wireless markets. He explored how Madonna&#x27;s foray into the medium inspired other marketers and advertisers, cementing her &quot;reputation for innovation and staying power&quot; and sparking a &quot;revolution of wireless ad campaigns&quot;.

The release of &quot;American Life&quot; has been also noted for Madonna&#x27;s forays fighting online piracy, with various labeling her stunt as a response not just to file-sharing community, but also against the very notion of free culture. Madonna&#x27;s fake tracks to peer-to-peer communities as her own strategy to stop piracy of the album, were called by media &quot;WTF&quot;. Although according to author Matt Mason, the tracks became viral movilizing hackers, remixers and hacktivists and soon radio stations and clubs around the world were playing pirate remixes of &quot;WTF&quot;. Fifteen of the best illegal remixes were compiled and released on an album by an independent label, and a website called &quot;Madonna Remix Project&quot; was created.

&quot;American Life&quot; also achieved early record-breaking streaming figures on websites such as MTV, Launch.com, MSN and AOL. According to MTV&#x27;s representatives, the channel &quot;has not previously seen such concentrated response rate for a dotcom programming feature before&quot; when they launched their web-based album previews in 1999. Madonna also became the second artist in history to debut with a song based on Internet sales alone on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with album&#x27;s title track. The digital release was touted as an alternative to fighting illegal downloading and seeking to &quot;inspire other artists to do the same&quot;. &quot;American Life&quot; became the first album in history to have seven top ten hits on the US Dance Club Songs.

Lucy O&#x27;Brien commented &quot;American Life&quot; marked a &quot;significant dip&quot; in her career, but like a lot of her peers, she had been &quot;compromised as an artist&quot; when a cultural &quot;atmosphere of fear&quot; invaded the United States. Commercially, the album was regarded a failure according to Madonna&#x27;s own &quot;hitmaking precedent&quot;. In 2005, Madonna acknowledged &quot;American Life&quot; as her lowest-selling album in her career up to that point, but referred to it as one of her catalog&#x27;s favorite records. &quot;Queerty&quot; magazine commented, &quot;sure the album wasn&#x27;t a commercial success, but that&#x27;s what makes it all the more special. It&#x27;s a reminder of an era and a statement about the present&quot;. The publication concluded that the album acts as a time capsule and &quot;as an example of how music can be used to challenge the status quo and make us think about our own values and beliefs&quot;.

=== Retrospective reviews ===
Retrospective reviews of the album have been more positive, with some reviewers praising Madonna&#x27;s risks making political statements. The album has also developed a cult following. Editor Matthew Rettenmund commented &quot;many of the songs are on par with her best work&quot;. &quot;Easy Ride&quot;, &quot;X-Static Process&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; were included among Madonna&#x27;s greatest deep cuts in rankings by publications such as &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, &quot;PopMatters&quot;, VH1 and the Official Charts Company.

A re-review by &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the album as a &quot;brilliantly odd peek behind fame&#x27;s velvet rope&quot; and &quot;tantalising&quot;, and was picked by their staffers as one of her best albums. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine staffers called it an &quot;uneven album&quot; but &quot;not as bad as some detractors would have you believe&quot;. They stated, &quot;you have to applaud the album&#x27;s adventurous melange of electronica, folk and pop music – not to mention the incisive, skeptical lyrics&quot;. Chuck Arnold from the same magazine, noted &quot;American Life&quot; as &quot;underappreciated&quot;, &quot;ambitious&quot; and complimented the album&#x27;s cohesiveness. Another contributor from the magazine, Jon O&#x27;Brien, commented &quot;its lyrics were a little more revolutionary&quot;. While reviewing the album and her discography, Saeed Saeed from &quot;The National&quot; commented that &quot;even Madonna&#x27;s worst albums are considered a solid offering when compared to other artists&quot;. Mike Wass from &quot;Idolator&quot; headlined &quot;American Life&quot; as an &quot;underrated gem&quot;. Conversely, in January 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;American Life&quot; at number 26 on their list of the &quot;50 Genuinely Horrible Albums by Brilliant Artists&quot;, characterizing &quot;the whole project [...] hopelessly muddled when it wasn&#x27;t just downright embarrassing&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;American Life&quot; also achieved award nominations. At the Hungarian Music Awards of 2004 and 2005, the album was nominated both times in the category of &quot;International Pop Album of the Year&quot;, but failed to win. Another nomination was for a similar category at the 2004 NRJ Music Awards and 2003 Shangay Awards. In 2004, the album was nominated at the 46th Grammy Awards in two categories &quot;Best Short Form Music Video&quot; and &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot;, both for the song &quot;Die Another Day.&quot; It was also nominated for &quot;Best Video from a Film&quot; at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards.

<text>Today Today was a drivetime radio show on Australia-wide radio station Triple J, broadcast between 3:00pm and 5:30pm weekdays during 2004 and 2005. The title is a parody of the Australian current affairs program &quot;Today Tonight&quot; on Channel Seven.

It was hosted by Chaser members Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel (&quot;Chris and Craig&quot;). The theme music to the show was the opening riff to the song &quot;She Says What She Means&quot; by Canadian band Sloan

The show combined political satire, comedic discussion of the days events, and talkback from listeners with funny anecdotes on a given topic. Reucassel and Taylor also create satirical skits to play between program segments which lampoon commercial radio stations, current TV shows and topical world events. Other regular segments included the Small Talk Challenge, Two Types of People, Marketing Makeover and Pisslame Puns of the Week.

One of the shows recurring segments, &#x27;Coma FM&#x27;, was a parody of many aspects of Australian commercial radio. These included radio hosts&#x27; nicknames, a low-pitched Americanised accent, strange noises (such as the station&#x27;s callsign), forced laughter at poor jokes, an emphasis on playing new music and not repeating any tracks, segments that play the &quot;greatest hits from the 80s, 90s and mid-90s&quot;, large amounts of advertising and competitions – especially those that give away &quot;cold hard cash&quot;. &#x27;Coma FM&#x27; also mocked the target audience of commercial radio with the use of callers and comments on many controversial issues such as the Bali Nine.

In late 2004, Chris and Craig took six weeks off to rejoin The Chaser team to produce an election special, &quot;The Chaser Decides&quot;, during the 2004 federal election campaign. The fill in hosts were Jason Whalley and Lindsay McDougall, aka Jay and the Doctor, who went on to become Triple J&#x27;s breakfast show hosts from 2005 onwards.

On 6 December 2005, Chris and Craig broadcast the final &quot;Today Today&quot; program, and announced they and the rest of the Chaser team would be back on television in 2006. The show was &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;. The new host for Triple J&#x27;s drive timeslot was Robbie Buck.

Chris and Craig returned to the airwaves in 2015 as part of Triple J&#x27;s 40th birthday celebrations on sister radio station Double J.

==Bloody Sunday==

On 16 July 2006, Chris and Craig returned to Triple J for a temporary run with their show Bloody Sunday. They replaced Roy and HG&#x27;s Sunday afternoon show This Sporting Life for four weeks. The show&#x27;s first episode listed a single banana on eBay.

On 10 December 2006, the program resumed in the same slot for 9 weeks over summer, billing itself as &#x27;non-ratings period radio at its most desperate.&#x27; Listeners could often hear a TV in the background of the studio, as Chris and Craig liked to have the cricket or CNN on during the show. On the first show of 2007, Craig ran about an hour late for the show, illuminating the team&#x27;s undivided devotion to the Sunday afternoon slot. The pair also predicted Naomi Robson&#x27;s appearance on dancing with the stars in 2007.

<doc id="1160272" wikidata="Q1516278" url="?curid=1160272" title="The Dudesons">
<text>The Dudesons () are a Finnish entertainment group. They are best known for their TV shows and live performances, which are a combination of stunts and comedy. Their early TV shows were similar to &quot;Jackass&quot;. Starting their television career in the early 2000s, they gained international fame and had a show on the American television channel MTV in 2010. After &quot;The Dudesons in America&quot;, the group started to shift from the stunts to more multidimensional careers.

==Background==
The Dudesons consists of Jukka Hildén (b. 1980), Jarppi Leppälä (b. 1979), Jarno Laasala (b. 1979) and Hannu-Pekka &quot;HP&quot; Parviainen (b. 1981). All were from the town of Seinäjoki, where Hildén, Leppälä, and Laasala became close friends while attending elementary school together, where they later met Parviainen.

As teenagers, the four became quite interested in snowboarding, skateboarding and downhill mountain biking. In the early 1990s, when Laasala got his first video camera, the group began filming their activities which eventually led to further pranks and extreme stunts. They created and sold VHS tapes which were filmed and edited by Laasala and subsequently their reputation began to grow in Seinäjoki.

==Original Finnish TV series==
In January 2000, Jarno Laasala obtained a job as an editor for a small Finnish cable TV channel called MoonTV. Similar to the American show &quot;Jackass&quot;, he saw a possibility to make his own show out of all the stunts the Dudesons had filmed. After finishing high school, the Dudesons set up their own production company called Rabbit Films. The group immediately began shooting a self-financed pilot episode of their own show.

This pilot was finished in August 2000 and the channel immediately green lit the first season, titled as &quot;Maailmankiertue&quot; (Worldtour). The episodes began airing in January 2001, and the series became the most popular show on MoonTV. In September 2001, the Dudesons moved from MoonTV to a nationwide TV channel Nelonen. The 2nd season, called &quot;Extreme Duudsonit, Maailmankiertue 2&quot;, was first screened in 2002, and the same year the Dudesons were also elected as The Media Persons of the Year by the readers of Finland&#x27;s most popular youth magazine &quot;Suosikki&quot;. The 3rd (Maailmankiertue 3) and 4th seasons (Duudsoni Elämää) of Extreme Duudsonit ran respectively in 2003 and 2004.

Recurring stunts and segments on the English-language version of the Dudesons includes: the &quot;Human Dartboard,&quot; playing pranks on &quot;Mr. Hitler&quot; and a vast array of other stunts with &quot;absolute disregard for [their] own safety.&quot;

==International career==

In 2003, the Dudesons made a decision to start making English-language material in order to find international distribution. Their following series, Duudsoni Elämää, was shot both in Finnish and English. The material was then edited both into Finnish-language series, and English language series. The Finnish series ran in 2004, while the English series had its international debut at Australian Channel V in February 2006. The American debut was on SpikeTV on 6 July 2006.

The Dudesons appeared in one episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; together in 2006.

Jarppi, Jukka, and Jarno can be seen on Bam Margera&#x27;s &quot;Viva La Bam&quot;. Jarppi and Jukka can also be seen on &quot;Bam Margera Presents: Where the ♯$&amp;% Is Santa?&quot; (2008) and &quot;&quot; (2009).

Jukka appeared on &quot;Tom Green Live!&quot; on 10 October 2006 as a special guest with Steve-O from &quot;Jackass&quot;.

By September 2007, the Dudesons Season 1 had been shown in 22 countries around the world, making it the most widespread Finnish TV-series of all time. The second season began in Australia on 20 May 2008 on Channel V.
By the year 2010, different Dudesons seasons have been seen in over 150 countries.

In 2008, the Dudesons introduced Paramore in the &quot;Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2008&quot;.

The Dudesons presented the best hip hop award for the &quot;2010 MTV Europe Music Awards&quot;.

The Dudesons appeared as musical performers in one episode of &quot;Skavlan&quot; together in 2011.

The Dudesons also appeared as a guest in one episode of &quot;Loiter Squad&quot; in 2013.

Jarppi and Jukka also made an appearance in one episode of &quot;Ridiculousness&quot; in 2014.

With a budget of six million dollars, it would consist of the same line-up of all four Dudesons, and was set to be produced by both Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine. The Dudesons&#x27; own production company, Rabbit Films, decided to do the show with the co-operation of Dickhouse. &quot;The Dudesons have balls where there should be brains and I am honored to be doing a show with them,&quot; Knoxville says on the Dudesons&#x27;s official website.

<doc id="1160278" wikidata="Q3030188" url="?curid=1160278" title="Checkers speech">
<text>The Checkers speech or Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by Senator Richard Nixon (R-CA), six weeks before the 1952 United States presidential election, in which he was the Republican nominee for Vice President. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. His place was in doubt on the Republican ticket, so he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that he intended to keep one gift, regardless of the outcome: a black-and-white Cocker Spaniel that his children had named Checkers, thus giving the address its popular name.

Nixon came from a family of modest means, as he related in the address, and he had spent his time after law school in the military, campaigning for office, and serving in Congress. After his successful 1950 Senate campaign, his backers continued to raise money to finance his political activities. These contributions went to reimburse him for travel costs, postage for political mailings which he did not have franked, and similar expenses. Such a fund was not illegal at the time, but Nixon had made a point of attacking government corruption which exposed him to charges that he might be giving special favors to the contributors.

The press became aware of the fund in September 1952, two months after Nixon&#x27;s selection as General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s running mate, and the story quickly grew until it threatened his place on the ticket. In an attempt to turn the tide of public opinion, Nixon broke off a whistle-stop tour of the West Coast to fly to Los Angeles and make a television and radio broadcast to the nation; the RNC raised the $75,000 to buy the television time. The idea for the Checkers reference came from Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Fala speech, given eight years to the day before Nixon&#x27;s address, in which Roosevelt mocked Republican claims that he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, when Fala was supposedly left behind in the Aleutian Islands.

Nixon&#x27;s speech was seen and heard by about 60 million Americans, including the largest television audience to that time, and it led to an outpouring of public support. The RNC and other political offices received millions of telegrams and phone calls supporting Nixon. He was retained on the ticket, which swept to victory weeks later in November 1952. The Checkers speech was an early example of a politician using television to appeal directly to the electorate, but it has sometimes been mocked or denigrated. The term &quot;Checkers speech&quot; has come more generally to mean a personal, emotionally-charged speech given by a politician in order to win support from the public.

== Background ==
In 1950, California Congressman Richard Nixon was elected to the Senate, defeating Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. With the six-year term secured, Nixon campaign officials discussed how to further his career. Campaign manager Murray Chotiner and campaign chairman Bernie Brennan proposed a year-round campaign for the next six years, leading up to a re-election bid in 1956. Nixon&#x27;s Southern California campaign treasurer Dana Smith suggested what became known as &quot;the Fund,&quot; to be administered by himself, which would pay for Nixon&#x27;s political expenses.

As Smith wrote to one potential contributor, money donated to the Fund was to be used for:

As a senator, Nixon received an annual salary of $12,500 (). While he received an expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California was one of the most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of twelve and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.

Nixon later characterized the attitude of his backers and aides as, &quot;We want you to start campaigning right now for 1956, and we think the way to do it is to have available the funds to make speeches, make trips to California, and so forth.&quot; Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000 (). Nixon was not to be informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon &quot;will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest&quot;. By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 () had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000 (), principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator&#x27;s Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54 (). Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.

== Fund crisis ==
In 1952, the Republicans chose Dwight D. Eisenhower as their presidential candidate, who then selected Nixon as his running mate, while the Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson for president and Alabama Senator John Sparkman for vice president. The California delegation to the 1952 Republican National Convention, including Nixon, had been pledged to the state&#x27;s &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate, Governor Earl Warren, who hoped to gain the presidential nomination in a brokered convention. Warren failed in his attempt to gain the nomination, and his supporters alleged that Nixon had worked behind the scenes to nominate Eisenhower despite his pledge to support Warren, and accused him of political opportunism for accepting the vice-presidential nomination. A disgruntled Warren supporter from Pasadena leaked the Fund story to several reporters.

Nixon had campaigned for public integrity in his time in the Senate, even calling for the resignation of his own party chairman, Guy Gabrielson, when the latter was implicated in a loan scandal. By using such &quot;indignant rhetoric,&quot; Nixon had &quot;weakened his own position&quot; when the Fund crisis erupted.

=== Development of the story ===
On September 14, Nixon was asked about the Fund by reporter Peter Edson of the Newspaper Enterprise Association after the senator completed an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Nixon told Edson that the Fund was set up by his supporters to pay political expenses, explained that he had made no effort to find out the names of the donors, and referred Edson to Smith for further information. Edson, and other reporters, did contact Smith, who answered questions about the Fund. Three days later, Nixon&#x27;s campaign train, the &quot;&quot;Dick Nixon Special,&quot; left Pomona, California, on a whistle-stop campaign tour of the West Coast and Rocky Mountain states.
Edson&#x27;s column on the 18th, which included lengthy quotes by Smith on the supposed safeguards in the Fund, was later called by Nixon, &quot;fair and objective&quot;. However, Leo Katcher of the &quot;New York Post&quot; interviewed Smith and wrote a story under the headline &quot;Secret Rich Men&#x27;s Trust Fund Keeps Nixon in Style Far Beyond His Salary&quot; and referred to the Fund donors as a &quot;millionaires&#x27; club&quot;. Nixon later praised Katcher&#x27;s younger brother Edward, also a reporter, for his objectivity, but told him, &quot;your brother Leo is a son of a bitch.&quot;

When the &quot;Dick Nixon Special&quot; arrived in Bakersfield, California, that day, Nixon, still oblivious to the developing furor, made a speech promoting the Republican ticket, and backing local congressman Thomas H. Werdel. After the speech, Republican activist Keith McCormac showed Nixon the &quot;Post&quot; story, which had been picked up by United Press under the headline &quot;Nixon Scandal Fund&quot;. According to McCormac, the senator collapsed into his seat in shock, and needed the help of Murray Chotiner, who was again Nixon&#x27;s campaign manager, and Congressman Patrick J. Hillings (a Nixon confidant who had succeeded him in the House of Representatives) to return to his compartment.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Stephen A. Mitchell called for Nixon&#x27;s resignation from the ticket, saying that &quot;Senator Nixon knows that [the Fund] is morally wrong. General Eisenhower knows that it is morally wrong. The American people know that it is morally wrong.&quot; On the other hand, Republican Senator Karl Mundt called the story &quot;a filthy maneuver by left-wingers, fellow travelers, and former communists&quot;. Nixon issued a written statement explaining that the fund was to pay political expenses, in lieu of charging them to the taxpayer. Newspapers printed increasingly lurid accounts of the Fund and its beneficiary. The &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; termed Nixon, &quot;the pet protégé of a special interest group of rich southern Californians ... their front man, if not, indeed, their lobbyist&quot;. The &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot;, meanwhile, reported that one contributor had been appealed to on the grounds that the Nixon family needed a larger home and could not afford a maid.

The train reached Marysville, California, on the morning of September 19, and Nixon gave a speech from the rear platform. As the train pulled out, while he remained on the rear platform, someone in the crowd yelled, &quot;What about the $16,000?&quot; (the amount then thought to have been contributed to the Fund). Nixon had the train stopped, and responded that he had been told that if he continued on his political course, &quot;crooks and communists&quot; would smear him. He told the crowd that the Fund had saved the taxpayer money, since it paid for matters that could have been paid for through his Senate expense allowance. He promised to throw the &quot;crooks and communists&quot; out of Washington.

Eisenhower was on his own train, the &quot;Look Ahead, Neighbor&quot;, stumping through Missouri, and on the morning of the 19th, his campaign staff made him aware of the gathering storm. Eisenhower publicly called upon Nixon to release all documents relating to the Fund, somewhat to the dismay of Chotiner, who wondered, &quot;What more does the general require than the senator&#x27;s word?&quot; Eisenhower aides contacted the senior Republican senator from California, William Knowland, and persuaded him to fly from Hawaii to join the Eisenhower train and be available as a potential replacement running mate.

By this time, Nixon campaign headquarters was receiving a flood of messages, calling on Nixon to resign from the ticket. When Eisenhower&#x27;s train stopped for the candidate to make speeches, he faced protesters with signs reading &quot;Donate Here to Help Poor Richard Nixon&quot;. The influential &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot; both called for Nixon to leave the ticket, facts which Chotiner did not tell his candidate; Nixon learned them from a questioning reporter. Over 100 newspapers would editorialize about the Fund on the morning of September 20, opinion running two to one against Nixon. As his train stopped in Eugene, Oregon, Nixon was met with protestors&#x27; signs referencing his wife: &quot;Pat, What Are You Going to Do With the Bribe Money?&quot; and &quot;No Mink Coats for Nixon—Just Cold Cash&quot;. He angrily responded with a phrase which would be echoed in the Checkers speech. After stating that there were no mink coats for the Nixons, he said that he was &quot;proud of the fact that Pat Nixon wears a good Republican cloth coat, and she&#x27;s going to continue to&quot;.

Politicians from both parties opined on the propriety of the Fund and on what Nixon should do, most in accord with their political affiliation. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson, though, publicly reserved judgment, leading Chotiner to suspect &quot;that Stevenson is afraid of something here. I bet he has something to hide.&quot;

=== Idea for a speech ===
On September 20, Republican National Committee official Bob Humphreys first suggested that Nixon give a televised speech to the nation to explain his position. RNC chairman and future Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield thought well of the idea, but was concerned about the expense. That evening, Nixon conferred with his aides, who unanimously urged him not to resign from the ticket. Humphreys called Chotiner at Nixon&#x27;s hotel in Portland, Oregon that evening, and the campaign manager realized that the broadcast was the best opportunity for Nixon to make his case. Humphreys suggested Nixon appear on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, but Chotiner rejected the suggestion, insisting that his candidate must have complete control of the broadcast &quot;without interruption by possibly unfriendly press questions&quot;. Humphreys mentioned that Summerfield was concerned about the cost of a television broadcast, but Chotiner noted that the cost of reprinting all campaign materials to reflect a change on the ticket would be far more than that of a telecast.

The avalanche of editorial opinion continued the following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment. Eisenhower considered asking retired Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts to evaluate the legality of the Fund, but time constraints ruled him out. Eisenhower decided to ask the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher for a legal opinion, while asking the accounting firm Price Waterhouse to audit the Fund&#x27;s records. Nixon, meanwhile, was encouraged by a supportive telegram from his mother and discouraged by one from former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen urging him to resign from the ticket. New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a Nixon supporter, called to tell Nixon that most Eisenhower aides favored his removal, and that if Nixon made the telecast, he should call for people to write to express their opinions. Dewey added that if the response was not strongly pro-Nixon, then he should leave the ticket.

Nixon finally got a call from Eisenhower at 10:00 pm, Pacific Time, Sunday night. Eisenhower expressed a reluctance to see him leave the ticket, and felt that he should have a chance to make his case to the American people. Nixon enquired if Eisenhower would be able to make a decision on whether to keep him as the running mate immediately after the broadcast, and when Eisenhower equivocated, he angrily burst out: &quot;General, there comes a time in matters like this when you&#x27;ve either got to shit or get off the pot.&quot; Eisenhower replied that it might take three or four days to gauge public reaction.

=== Preparation and setting ===
Through the night to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides arranged the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 () needed to buy the half-hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half-hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; show, but when Nixon indicated he could not be ready that soon, settled for 6:30 pm Tuesday night, 9:30 pm in the East, following the almost equally popular &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Radio City West. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.

On Monday morning, Nixon flew to Los Angeles, making notes for his speech aboard the plane. He jotted down the line he had said in Eugene regarding his wife&#x27;s coat. He made notes concerning the family finances, upsetting Pat Nixon, who asked why people had to know their financial details. Nixon responded that people in politics live in a fishbowl. He recalled the Fala speech, in which Franklin Roosevelt had sarcastically responded to Republican claims he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, and remembered the dog his children had recently received: A Texas traveling salesman named Lou Carrol had read a report that Pat Nixon said her children Tricia and Julie &quot;longed&quot; for a dog, and his own dog, an American Cocker Spaniel, had just had a litter. After a telegram exchange, he crated the puppy and shipped it by rail to the Nixons, and six-year-old Tricia Nixon named the dog &quot;Checkers&quot;. Nixon decided that including the anecdote evoking FDR would needle his enemies and delight his friends.

When the plane reached Los Angeles, Nixon secluded himself in a suite in The Ambassador Hotel, letting no one except his wife, Chotiner, and attorney and adviser William P. Rogers have any hint what he was planning. He called two professors he knew at his alma mater, Whittier College, seeking appropriate Abraham Lincoln quotes. They called back with two suggestions, one of which he used. Unwilling to have his message filtered, Nixon adamantly refused to provide the media with any advance text of his speech, convinced that it would reduce the size of his audience. Without any hard information on what would be said during the speech, rumors flew through the media. UPI reported that Nixon would resign from the ticket well before the scheduled time for the speech. On the evening of the 22nd, the media broke the story that Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson had a similar fund, as Chotiner had predicted. The Stevenson information had been leaked by Bob Humphreys at the RNC, but as he later ruefully noted, &quot;Nobody paid much attention to it.&quot;

The morning of the 23rd, the day of the speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no evidence of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon&#x27;s nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.

At 4:30 pm, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were discussing where the public should be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting the reason for the call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower&#x27;s aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state at the end of his telecast. Nixon asked what Eisenhower wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general&#x27;s view. Nixon replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. Dewey suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—he was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower&#x27;s aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, &quot;And tell them I know something about politics, too!&quot;

Nixon, somewhat dazed by the conversation with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into Nixon&#x27;s room, and told him that if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon&#x27;s departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner&#x27;s promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. The Nixons and the campaign staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future Nixon White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general&#x27;s aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager&#x27;s office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.

== Delivering the address ==
The El Capitan Theatre, at Nixon&#x27;s insistence, was entirely deserted. Press members were confined to a nearby room, where they could watch on television; stenographers were standing by at the Ambassador to ensure an accurate transcript of Nixon&#x27;s remarks for the press, who would be facing deadlines in the East. Chotiner and Rogers would watch from behind a screen in the theatre; Pat Nixon, wearing a dress knitted by supporters, would sit on stage a few feet from her husband. The chosen set was a &quot;GI bedroom den&quot; with a desk, two chairs, and bookshelves. Nixon usually preferred to work from a memorized text, but would work from notes for this speech to make the talk sound more spontaneous. Nixon spent some time practicing movements for the cameramen and finally went into the dressing room with his wife for a few minutes of solitude. He told her that he did not think he could go through with it, but she reassured him.

=== Introduction and office expenses ===
The speech opened with Nixon sitting at the desk. He began, &quot;My fellow Americans, I come before you tonight as a candidate for the Vice Presidency, and as a man whose honesty and integrity has been questioned.&quot; Nixon indicated that he would not follow the example of the Truman Administration and ignore charges, and that the best response to a smear &quot;is to tell the truth&quot;.

Nixon mentioned the $18,000 Fund, and that he was accused of taking money from a group of his supporters. After stating that the Fund was wrong if he had profited from it, if it had been conducted in secret, or if the contributors received special favors, he continued,

Nixon stated that no contributor to the fund got any service that an ordinary constituent would not have received, and then anticipated the skeptical questions, &quot;Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator? Why did you have to have it?&quot; In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but he stated that he was not rich. Another way was to put one&#x27;s spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a &quot;wonderful stenographer&quot; and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon for the first time to reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. Nixon indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.

=== Family finances, coat and dog ===
Nixon, continuing to ask skeptical rhetorical questions, indicated that some might feel that even with the opinions, he might have found some way to personally benefit. In response to his own question, he detailed his background and financial situation, beginning with his birth in Yorba Linda, and the family grocery store in which the Nixon boys helped out. He alluded to his work in college and law school, his service record, and stated that at the end of the war, he and Pat Nixon had $10,000 in savings, all of it patriotically in government bonds. He gave the dollar amounts of small inheritances that the Nixons had received from relatives, before turning to their life in Washington:

As Nixon discussed their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze was because she did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and that he and his wife owned no stocks or bonds.

While Nixon made these points, Murray Chotiner &quot;let out shouts of glee&quot; in his screened booth. As Chotiner exulted, Nixon moved ahead with the lines &quot;that would give the speech its name, make it famous, and notorious&quot;:

Nixon expressed pleasure that Stevenson, whom he termed a man who inherited wealth from his father, could run for president. But people &quot;of modest means&quot; must also get a chance, and he recited the quotation attributed to Lincoln: &quot;Remember Abraham Lincoln, you remember what he said: &#x27;God must have loved the common people—He made so many of them.&#x27;&quot;

=== Attack on Democrats; request for public to write ===
Nixon then called for Stevenson to give a full accounting of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. &quot;Because, folks, remember, a man that&#x27;s to be President of the United States, a man that&#x27;s to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m doing what I&#x27;m doing, and that&#x27;s why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing.&quot; As Nixon made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing that he would not be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.

Nixon warned that other smears would be made against him, and many of the same commentators who were attacking him now had also attacked him for his role in the Alger Hiss case, for which he made no apologies. He then rose to his feet, came out from behind the desk, and continued:

Nixon alleged that Stevenson had downplayed the threat of communism, and was thus unfit to be president. He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit to lead the country in ridding the government of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from the wife of a serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised that he would never cash that check.

With less than three minutes left in the allotted time, Nixon finally addressed the question: Would he stay or would he go? He indicated that he did not think he should go. &quot;Let me say this: I don&#x27;t believe that I ought to quit because I&#x27;m not a quitter. And, incidentally, Pat&#x27;s not a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, and you know the Irish never quit.&quot;

Seizing on the fact that the Republican National Convention had routinely given the RNC the power to fill vacancies on the ticket, Nixon evaded Eisenhower&#x27;s power as the general again slammed his pencil down, this time breaking it:

Advancing towards the camera, he completed the speech by praising Eisenhower, &quot;He&#x27;s a great man. And a vote for Eisenhower is a vote for what&#x27;s good for America.&quot;

== Aftermath ==

=== Candidates and public ===
Nixon was initially convinced that the speech was a failure. Despite the congratulations of Rogers and Chotiner, and the fact that one of the cameramen had tears running down his face, he reproved himself for not mentioning the address of the Republican National Committee. Though the Young Republicans continued their applause as the Nixon party left the theatre, he fixed on an Irish Setter running alongside his car as it pulled away from the curb. &quot;Well, we made a hit in the dog world anyway.&quot; Despite the senator&#x27;s despair, his wife was convinced that her husband had vindicated himself. Over sixty million Americans had watched or listened to the speech, including the largest television audience up to that point.

Nixon had left the Ambassador with the lobby quiet; he returned to a mob scene, and he was soon surrounded by well-wishers congratulating him. The party was able to get through to his suite, and after a few minutes of tense quiet, calls and telegrams began to pour in &quot;from everywhere&quot; praising the speech and urging him to remain on the ticket—but no word came from Eisenhower in Cleveland.

In Cleveland, as the speech concluded, General Eisenhower turned to RNC Chairman Summerfield, &quot;Well, Arthur, you sure got your money&#x27;s worth.&quot; Mamie Eisenhower was in tears, and the general told her that Nixon was a completely honest man. The 15,000 supporters waiting for Eisenhower to speak had heard the Checkers speech over the hall&#x27;s public address system, and when Congressman George H. Bender took the microphone and asked the crowd, &quot;Are you in favor of Nixon?&quot;, pandemonium ensued. As the crowd below chanted, &quot;We want Nixon!&quot;, Eisenhower quickly revised his speech.

Both Eisenhower&#x27;s speech to the excited crowd and telegram to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC had the power to elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where their campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower&#x27;s telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon&#x27;s suite, and the latter learned of his running mate&#x27;s position from a wire service report.

When he heard of Eisenhower&#x27;s posture, Nixon&#x27;s happiness at what he had finally been convinced was a &quot;&quot; turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy Eisenhower, nothing he could do would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left the room with her notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon&#x27;s rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that Nixon would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting. &quot;Dick is not going to be placed in the position of a little boy going somewhere to beg for forgiveness.&quot;

Just before the Nixon party left for the airport, Nixon friend and journalist Bert Andrews managed to reach him by phone. Andrews told Nixon that he should go to Wheeling; that public reaction had already foreordained the outcome. He advised Nixon that he should accede to Eisenhower&#x27;s desire to make the inevitable decision in his own way, advice Nixon acknowledged &quot;had the ring of truth&quot;. Nonetheless, the Nixon party flew to Missoula.

By this time, the first wave of what would eventually be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions to help pay for the cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC&#x27;s address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon&#x27;s request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.

Politicians generally reacted along party lines, with Republican Senator Mundt of South Dakota stating, &quot;Nixon&#x27;s speech is complete vindication against one of the most vicious smears in American history.&quot; Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico stated, &quot;I wish he had talked about the 18,000 bucks—not the puppy dog ... Suppose someone sets up a fund to buy my meals. I could say I didn&#x27;t get one red cent of the money.&quot;

On the morning of September 24, Summerfield and Humphreys called Nixon at his Missoula hotel. After securing his agreement to fly to Wheeling if Eisenhower agreed to Chotiner&#x27;s terms, the two reached Eisenhower and campaign leader New Hampshire Governor Sherman Adams in Portsmouth, Ohio, en route to Wheeling, and briefed them on the conversation with Nixon and on the flood of communications from the public. Eisenhower and Adams agreed that Nixon could come to Wheeling with the assurance he would remain on the ticket. After making speeches in Missoula and at a stop in Denver, and after Eisenhower made his own speech announcing that his running mate had been the victim of an &quot;attempted smear,&quot; Nixon arrived in Wheeling late in the day on the 24th. Eisenhower came to the airport to meet the plane, and hurried up the steps to greet the Nixons when the door was opened.

The candidates waved at the crowd of 3,000 which had come to meet the plane, and rode together, with Nixon in place of honor, to a rally at City Island Stadium as Eisenhower chatted to Nixon as if the crisis had never occurred. At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a &quot;colleague&quot; who had been subject to &quot;a vicious and unprincipled attack&quot; but who had &quot;vindicated himself&quot; and who &quot;stood higher than ever before&quot;. Eisenhower finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon&#x27;s mother assuring Eisenhower of her son&#x27;s integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that this was one of two moments when he was most proud to be an American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally &quot;the greatest moment of my life&quot;.

=== Media reaction ===
Editorial reaction to the address was divided. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which had criticized Nixon, and had even run stories with claims that he was under criminal investigation for the Fund, praised Nixon&#x27;s &quot;composure and assurance&quot;. The &quot;New York Journal American&quot; gushed, &quot;He was in our opinion, simply magnificent. We know of no other way to say it.&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; called the address &quot;an extraordinary speech&quot;. The &quot;Mobile Register&quot; stated that the Fund crisis &quot;confronted [Nixon] with an unsought opportunity which he made the most of.&quot;

However, some newspapers disagreed. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; noted that Nixon &quot;did not deal in any way with the underlying question of propriety,&quot; while the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; called the address &quot;a carefully contrived soap opera&quot;. Columnist Walter Lippmann called the wave of support for Nixon &quot;disturbing ... with all the magnification of modern electronics, simply mob law;&quot; discussing the speech with a dinner guest, he said, &quot;That must be the most demeaning experience my country has ever had to bear.&quot; Columnist Thomas Stokes criticized Eisenhower for equivocating on the question of his running mate until &quot;the young man himself—the accused—had to step in and take over. And how he took over!&quot; Through his presidency, Eisenhower would continue to be accused of being indecisive.

Nixon refused to answer further questions about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson&#x27;s fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson&#x27;s fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon&#x27;s book, the Democrats refused to answer questions about Stevenson&#x27;s fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.

== Legacy ==
With &quot;The New York Times&quot; finding that Nixon&#x27;s performance had given the Republican ticket &quot;a shot in the arm&quot;, Eisenhower and Nixon swept to victory in November, with the Republicans narrowly taking both Houses of Congress. According to Nixon biographer Conrad Black, the speech earned Nixon supporters throughout Middle America which he would keep through the rest of his life, and who would continue to defend him after his death. Critics, however, would later see the address as the &quot;ultimate expression&quot; of the controversial politician&#x27;s &quot;phoniness&quot;. Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose stated that part of the audience considered the address &quot;one of the most sickening, disgusting, maudlin performances ever experienced&quot;. In their analysis of the speech published just before Nixon&#x27;s election as president in 1968, Robert S. Cathcart and Edward A. Schwarz suggested that while Nixon &quot;met the accusation head-on
and accomplished his immediate goals successfully, he ultimately created an image which led to a decline in his political career.&quot;

The address was an unprecedented demonstration of the power of television to galvanize large segments of the American people to act in a political campaign. However, the onslaught of negative media attention leading up to the address &quot;left its scars&quot; on Nixon, and the future president never returned to the easy relationship with the press that he had enjoyed during his congressional career. His oft-stated view that the media was the enemy came to play a part in his downfall.
Nixon celebrated the anniversary of the speech each year. The future president disliked the fact that the address soon became popularly known as the &quot;Checkers speech&quot;. In his 1962 book, &quot;Six Crises&quot; (the Fund crisis being one of the six), he would object to the term, &quot;as though the mention of my dog was the only thing that saved my political career&quot;. Nixon preferred to call the address &quot;the Fund speech,&quot; and made it required reading for his speechwriters. As time passed, the Checkers speech became denigrated, and Nixon biographer Earl Mazo suggested that much of the attitude of &quot;I don&#x27;t like Nixon, but I don&#x27;t know why,&quot; which contributed to the failure of his 1960 presidential run, can be traced to the Checkers speech. Other commentators suggested that had he not made the Checkers speech, Nixon might have won in 1960. Nixon retorted that without the Checkers speech, he would not have been around to run in 1960.

Checkers died in 1964 and was buried in Wantagh, New York, at Long Island&#x27;s Bide-A-Wee Pet Cemetery. In 1999, 137 scholars of American public address were asked to recommend speeches for inclusion on a list of &quot;the 100 best American political speeches of the 20th century,&quot; based on &quot;social and political impact, and rhetorical artistry&quot;. This speech placed 6th on the list.

Despite the many criticisms of the speech in later years, Hal Bochin (who wrote a book about Nixon&#x27;s rhetoric) suggests that Nixon succeeded at the time because of his use of narrative, spinning a story which resonated with the public:

&quot;Checkers speech&quot; has since entered the English lexicon as an idiom meaning a personal, emotionally-charged speech given by a politician in order to win support from the public.

<text>The Verulamium Forum Inscription (tentatively dated to AD 79, during the reign of the emperor Titus) is one of the many Roman inscriptions in Britain. It is also known as the &quot;Basilica inscription&quot;, as it is believed to have been attached to the basilica of Verulamium (on the edge of modern St Albans). The surviving fragments have been reconstructed as a large dedication slab (approx. 4.3m x 1.0m) on display at Verulamium Museum.

The fragments were found in 1955 during construction work in the yard of St Michael&#x27;s Primary School, St Albans. The find-spot lay near the north-east entrance to the forum and basilica of Verulamium.
The inscription is notable because it mentions Gnaeus Julius Agricola, the Roman governor of Britain from AD 77–84, who is otherwise known from a biography written by his son-in-law Tacitus.

==Text==

The inscription was reconstructed by Professor Sheppard Frere to read as follows:
[IMP TITO CAESARI DIVI] VESPA[SIANI] F VES[PASIANO AUG]
[P M TR P VIIII IMP XV COS VII] DESI[G VIII CENSORI PATRI PATRIAE]
[ [ ET CAESARI DIVI VESPASIANI F DOMITIANO COS VI DESIG VII PRINCIPI ] ]
[ [ IVVENTVTIS ET OMNIVM COLLEGIORVM SACERDOTI ] ]
[CN IVLIO A]GRIC[OLA LEGATO AUG PRO] PR
[MVNICIPIVM] VE[RVLAMIVM BASILICA OR]NATA

This version would be expanded to read:
IMP(eratori) TITO CAESARI DIVI VESPASIANI F(ilio) VESPASIANO AVG(usto)
P(ontifici) M(aximo) TR(ibuniciae) P(otestatis) VIIII IMP(eratori) XV CO(n)S(uli) VII DESIG(nato) VIII CENSORI PATRI PATRIAE
ET CAESARI DIVI VESPASIANI F(ilio) DOMITIANO CO(n)S(uli) VI DESIG(nato) VII PRINCIPI IVVENTVTIS ET OMNIVM COLLEGIORVM SACERDOTI
GN(aeo) IVLIO AGRICOLA LEGATO AVG(usti) PRO PR(aetore)
MVNICIPIVM VERVLAMIVM BASILICA ORNATA
This translates as:
For the Emperor Titus Caesar Vespasian Augustus, son of the deified Vespasian,
Pontifex Maximus, in the ninth year of tribunician power, acclaimed Imperator fifteen times, having been consul seven times, designated consul for an eighth time, censor, Father of the Fatherland,
and to Caesar Domitian, son of the deified Vespasian, having been consul six times, designated consul for a seventh term, Prince of Youth, and member of all the priestly brotherhoods,
when Gnaeus Julius Agricola was legate of the emperor with pro-praetorian power,
the Verulamium basilica was adorned.
The last line is particularly fragmentary, and the alternative reconstruction CIVITAS CATVVELLAVNORVM FORO EXORNATA (&quot;the forum of the Catuvellaunian tribal council was embellished&quot;) has been considered, along with the less likely RESPVBLICA VERVLAMIVM LATIO DONA (&quot;... donated the funds to widen the Verulamium public-works&quot;).

The inscription can be dated either to AD 79, the year Vespasian died (he would not have been referred to as &quot;divus&quot; until after his death) and Titus had his seventh consulship, or to AD 81 (by altering the various numerals). The reference to his brother Domitian was defaced, as were most inscriptions referring to him, after &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; was pronounced on him in 96.

==Publication==
The inscription has been published as:

<text>Edward Watson McWhinney, QC (May 19, 1924 – May 19, 2015) was a Canadian lawyer and academic specializing in constitutional and international law. He was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2000 for the electoral district of Vancouver Quadra.

==Life and career==
Born in Lismore, New South Wales, Australia, McWhinney, received his secondary education at North Sydney Boys High School, which he followed by study at the University of Sydney, becoming President of the Sydney University Liberal Club and Student Representative Council. McWhinney was a professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University and an expert on the Canadian Constitution who was often called upon to advise the Canadian government. He reportedly advised successive Canadian prime ministers since John Diefenbaker, as well as several governors general.

He held professorships at Yale, the Sorbonne, Toronto, McGill, Indiana, the Collège de France, and at the Meiji University in Tokyo. He was a legal consultant to the United Nations; constitutional adviser to the Premier of Ontario and to the Premier of Quebec; chief adviser to the Canadian government&#x27;s Task Force on National Unity (the Pepin-Robarts Commission); Royal Commissioner of Enquiry to the Government of Quebec; Special Commissioner of Enquiry for the Government of British Columbia; special adviser to the Canadian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, as well as constitutional and international law adviser to a number of foreign governments.

The author of 24 books (two of them in French and one in German), editor of 11 symposium volumes, and author of several hundred scientific articles, he was the first jurist from Canada to be elected to the century-old Institut de Droit International. He was a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague and was a member of the Institut Grand-Ducal of Luxembourg, and of the Académie Internationale de Droit Comparé in Paris. He died on May 19, 2015.

==Legal theory==
In 2005, in anticipation of the publication of his book, &quot;The Governor General and the Prime Ministers&quot;, Canadian media sources reported that McWhinney, a professor of constitutional law and former Member of Parliament, had suggested that a future government of Canada could begin a process of phasing out the monarchy after the eventual demise of Elizabeth II &quot;quietly and without fanfare by simply failing legally to proclaim any successor to the Queen in relation to Canada&quot;. This would, he claimed, be a way of bypassing the need for a constitutional amendment that would require unanimous consent by the federal parliament and all the provincial legislatures. However, Ian Holloway, Dean of Law at the University of Western Ontario, criticised McWhinney&#x27;s proposal for its ignorance of provincial input and opined that its implementation &quot;would be contrary to the plain purpose of those who framed our system of government.&quot;

<text>KALW (91.7 MHz) is an educational FM public radio station, licensed to the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), which serves the San Francisco Bay Area. Its studios are located at Phillip and Sala Burton Academic High School off Mansell Avenue in San Francisco, and its transmitter tower is on Twin Peaks.

KALW operates as a community public station, incorporating local volunteers in its news and music programs. The station&#x27;s programming is also webcast with live streaming audio.

==Programming==
KALW is an independently operated National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate, carrying content from NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International and the BBC World Service. KALW also produces its own local news, music and interview shows, including the live weekday call-in program &quot;Your Call&quot;, the morning news magazine &quot;Crosscurrents&quot;, and the weekly two-hour live variety program &quot;West Coast Live!&quot;, which was broadcast each Saturday morning, and ceased production in December 2018. National shows produced at the station include &quot;Inflection Point with Lauren Schiller&quot;.

As a part of its affiliation with the San Francisco Unified School District, KALW carries broadcasts of its monthly board meetings plus daily listings of school lunch menus, which are occasionally read by celebrities who have come to the station for interview shows.

==History==

In the late 1930s, San Francisco was a major center for radio development for the western United States. In 1939, General Electric established a powerful shortwave station in conjunction with the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition on San Francisco Bay at Treasure Island, San Francisco. In August 1940, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) gave a demonstration of the then new technology of frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting at the National Association of Broadcasters convention being held in the city.

In May 1940, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that effective January 1, 1941 it was establishing a broadcast band for FM stations, operating on 40 channels spanning 42–50 MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. That same month the San Francisco Unified School District filed an application to construct a new educational FM station, operating on 42.1 MHz with 1,000 watts. The original station application, filed May 24, 1940, specified use of General Electric transmitters, but this was changed in January 1941 to specify an RCA FM-1-B transmitter.

KALW was constructed at Samuel Gompers Trades School and began test transmissions on March 10, 1941, becoming the first FM station to operate on the U.S. west coast, and the second U.S. educational station to begin broadcasting on the FM band. The station entered general service providing instructional programming on September 1.

In 1945 the FCC announced that, due to interference concerns, it was reallocating the current FM &quot;low band&quot; frequencies to other services and existing FM band stations would be relocated to 88–106 MHz (later expanded to 108 MHz). In July 1946 the FCC directed that FM stations currently operating on 42–44 MHz would have to move to new frequencies by the end of the year, and KALW changed its frequency from 42.1 to 44.3 MHz as an interim step. The station&#x27;s initial assignment on the new FM band was 91.3 MHz, and a subsequent reallocation in the fall of 1947 reassigned it to its current frequency of 91.7 MHz.

KALW was instrumental in helping KQED television sign on the air in 1954 as one of the first non-commercial educational television stations in the country, by providing technical training, studio space, and engineering advice to the KQED founding staff.

KALW provided Chinese-language simulcasts of KGO-TV newscasts in the 1970s, before local Asian language newscasts became established. During the 1970s and 1980s KALW also aired live coverage of SFUSD sporting events, the last such regular live coverage of high school sports in San Francisco broadcasting.

While KALW&#x27;s original transmitter had not been used since the switch to the modern FM band in the late 1940s, it was still located at John O&#x27;Connell Technical High School until the school was demolished in the mid-1990s.

In late October 2006, KALW suffered an antenna malfunction. The station continued to transmit with only three percent of normal power, causing many listeners to think the station had ceased broadcasting, although the audio stream was still available via the website. Fellow public broadcaster KQED-FM allowed KALW the use of their backup transmitter on San Bruno Mountain during the repair process. On November 2, 2006, station general manager Matt Martin posted an update on the station&#x27;s website explaining the problem and expressing his appreciation to KQED-FM for its technical assistance.

The City of San Francisco recognized &quot;KALW Day&quot; on the station&#x27;s 70th anniversary on September 8, 2011. Ten years later, on the station&#x27;s 80th birthday, San Francisco mayor London Breed declared September 1 to be &quot;KALW Day&quot;.

== License renewal challenge ==

In 1997, a group of disgruntled KALW employees filed a petition with the FCC to deny renewal of KALW&#x27;s broadcast license, alleging that station management had covered up violations of hiring rules and had lied about required record keeping. The case was inactive for several years and, according to KALW&#x27;s website, the group that filed the petition, known as Golden Gate Public Radio, was defunct.

In July 2004, the FCC resurrected the case. While it issued a warning to KALW about its employment practices, the commission determined that there was sufficient evidence supporting misrepresentation allegations to warrant formal hearings. The hearings concluded in June 2005, and FCC Chief Administrative Law Judge Richard Sippel ruled in April 2006 to grant a limited two-year license renewal for KALW, while reducing a fine for public file violations from $300,000 to $10,000. In its defense to the FCC, KALW management showed evidence of its meritorious service to the community. The school district also argued for a hardship case, saying it was incapable of paying the $10,000 fine, citing recent budget cuts in its local school programs for children as an example. The judge disagreed, however, and the SFUSD was given two years to pay the fine.

<doc id="1160300" wikidata="Q6395802" url="?curid=1160300" title="Kevin Bartlett (Australian rules footballer)">
<text>Kevin Charles Bartlett (born 6 March 1947) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Richmond Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Nicknamed &quot;KB&quot; or &quot;Hungry&quot; due to his appetite for kicking goals and apparent reluctance to handpass, Bartlett is a Legend of the Australian Football Hall of Fame and is the first VFL/AFL player to have reached the 400-game milestone, a feat since achieved by five other players as of 2024; he has played the fourth-most games of any player in VFL/AFL history. He is a key member of a golden era in Richmond&#x27;s history, playing in five premiership teams and winning five Jack Dyer Medals, equalling Jack Dyer&#x27;s tally.

Short and slender in stature, Bartlett possessed tremendous stamina, determination and a seemingly sixth sense to evade opposition players intent on negating his influence. He played much of his best football as Richmond&#x27;s starting rover but adapted superbly when moved to the half-forward flank towards the end of his career, as demonstrated in the 1980 VFL finals series.

When Bartlett returned to the Tigers in 1988 as senior coach, the club were in a shambles as a result of a bitter trade feud with . Although his record as coach appears disappointing, he nonetheless achieved some surprising results with very limited resources. After being sacked at the end of 1991, he distanced himself from Richmond for nearly two decades.

Following his retirement as a player, Bartlett developed a successful career as a sports commentator and broadcaster on both television and radio, currently working as a match caller for 3AW. He was a member of the AFL&#x27;s rules committee for many years—until he retired on 4 March 2014—as well as the selection panel for the All-Australian Team and AFL Rising Star awards.

In 2008, Bartlett was listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as the ninth-greatest player of all time in the AFL-commissioned book &quot;The Australian Game of Football&quot;.

==Early years and playing career==
Bartlett was born in the inner-northern Melbourne suburb of Carlton, the only son of Charles Bartlett, and grew up in Richmond. He supported as a young boy and was a spectator at the 1954 Grand Final triumph.

As a teenager, he walked from his home in Lennox Street, Richmond, to the Punt Road Oval, where he was greeted by the Richmond Fourths&#x27; coach Bill Boromeo.
It was this chance meeting that set in motion Bartlett&#x27;s path towards playing for Richmond. He began his career with the under-17s side, where he won the goalkicking and the best and fairest in 1962. In 1963, he won the best and fairest in the under-19s, and Richmond made the under-19s final series. Bartlett, however, was injured seconds into the first final against Geelong, which resulted in him being taken to the Prince Henry Hospital, where it was revealed that a cyst was embedded in his hip. It was while waiting for the ambulance to collect him in the MCG change rooms that he first met Jack Dyer. Dyer had appeared at the match, on the advice of Richmond under-19s coach Ray Jordon, and visited Bartlett in the rooms to tell him he would be okay. The following year for Bartlett (1964) involved rehabilitation, as he still experienced pain around his hip area.

===Records===
Bartlett was also the first player in elite Australian rules football to play 400 premiership games, with only six others achieving the feat as of 2023: four in the VFL/AFL (Hawthorn&#x27;s Michael Tuck, North Melbourne&#x27;s Brent Harvey, Essendon&#x27;s Dustin Fletcher and Port Adelaide and Hawthorn&#x27;s Shaun Burgoyne), one in the SANFL (Glenelg&#x27;s Peter Carey), and one in both leagues (Port Adelaide and Carlton&#x27;s Craig Bradley; Burgoyne also played 26 SANFL games for Port Adelaide prior to his AFL career).

His 403 premiership games remained an elite Australian rules football record until broken by Carey in Round 7 of the 1988 SANFL season, and an elite Victorian football record until broken by Tuck in Round 22 of the 1990 AFL season.

==Other matches and medal==
Bartlett also played 20 matches for Victoria in interstate football, 12 pre-season/night series matches (which are recognised as senior by the SANFL and WAFL but not the VFL/AFL), and four International Rules matches on the 1968 Australian Football World Tour (which are counted as senior by the VFL/AFL). If these are included, Bartlett played a total of 439 career senior matches.

The VFL/AFL record Bartlett&#x27;s total as 427 career senior games, excluding his pre-season/night series matches.

Despite the differing viewpoints, Bartlett was the first player to play 400 senior career games in elite Victorian football, which he achieved in either of Round 19 of 1982 (using the VFL/AFL&#x27;s total), Round 9 of 1982 (excluding his International Rules matches) or Round 5 of 1982 (using his overall total).

Depending on the viewpoint taken:
* The VFL/AFL&#x27;s total of 427 was an elite Australian rules football record until broken by Russell Ebert in Round 19 of the 1984 SANFL season, and an elite Victorian football record until broken by Tuck in Round 16 of the 1991 AFL season. 
* Excluding Bartlett&#x27;s International Rules matches, the total of 435 was an elite Australian rules football record until broken by Ebert in Round 11 of the 1985 SANFL season, and an elite Victorian football record until broken by Tuck in Round 19 of the 1990 AFL season.
* Including Bartlett&#x27;s International Rules matches, the total of 439 was an elite Australian rules football record until broken by Ebert in Round 15 of the 1985 SANFL season, and an elite Victorian football record until broken by Tuck in the 1990 AFL Elimination Final.
The substitution system was in use without interchange players for a large part of Bartlett&#x27;s 400 games, just the 19th and 20th man until the 3 Interchange player system was Introduced.

Bartlett&#x27;s total of senior career matches (using the VFL/AFL&#x27;s total) ranks third in elite Victorian football behind Tuck (437) and Brent Harvey (445), and seventh in elite Australian rules football. If his pre-season/night series matches are included, then Bartlett&#x27;s total of 435 or 439 senior career matches (depending on whether or not International Rules matches are included) either ranks third in elite Victorian football behind Tuck (466) and Harvey (480 or 491) and eighth in elite Australian rules football, or fourth in elite Victorian football behind Dustin Fletcher (441), Tuck and Harvey, and ninth in elite Australian rules football.

The Kevin Bartlett Medal is awarded each season to the player who finishes fifth in the Richmond Football Club&#x27;s best and fairest count, with places one to four being the Jack Dyer, Jack Titus, Maurie Fleming, and Fred Swift Medals respectively.

==Coaching career==
Bartlett was the Tigers&#x27; coach from 1988 to 1991. 
In the 1988 match against Hawthorn, after two Richmond players were felled, Bartlett was asked for a please explain by the VFL after comments he made. Controversy surrounding his dismissal as coach left him estranged from the football club for many years. However, on 30 March 2007 he attended his first official club function since 1991.

==Administrative career==
Kevin Bartlett was a key member and public face of the AFL &quot;Laws of the Game&quot; or Rules Committee until 4 March 2014. He was a selector of the Australian Football Hall of Fame from its inauguration in 1996 until his resignation in 2009, and is a selector of the yearly All-Australian team.

==Media career==
Bartlett joined Channel 7 in Melbourne immediately after his playing retirement, appearing regularly on World of Sport and hosting the Junior Supporters Club. In 1984, Bartlett was crowned &quot;King of Moomba&quot;. He also wrote for the Sun News Pictorial. His media commitments were put on hold during his four-year stint as Richmond coach. He has a great all-around interest in most sports and is one of the few ex-Australian football players who has carved out a career commentating on all manner of sports. From 2004, he was a radio host on Melbourne&#x27;s dedicated sports radio station, SEN – first with &quot;Hungry for Sport&quot;, a morning show playing on his nickname of &quot;Hungry&quot;, and then with &quot;KB and the Doc&quot; in the afternoon with John &quot;Dr Turf&quot; Rothfield beginning in 2018. He also commentated on Saturday and Sunday matches for SEN. He previously hosted the breakfast program on Sport 927 until 2003. He commentated on cable TV for Fox Footy and was the host of the popular nostalgia show &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; on Fox Footy until the channel&#x27;s closure at the end of the 2006 season. He also did a Richmond-centric official alternate commentary for FOX&#x27;s broadcast of Richmond vs. North Melbourne in June 2014 called &quot;Press Red for Kev&quot; in response to the &quot;Press Red for Ed&quot; Collingwood-centric alternate commentaries led by Eddie McGuire.

On 13 September 2008, he appeared in a Toyota Memorable Moments advertisement. The advertisement includes Bartlett recreating his seven goals from the 1980 VFL Grand Final, as well as his famous &#x27;comb-over&#x27; hairstyle, which comedian Dave Lawson recreates by shaving his own hair on camera. Geelong&#x27;s Matthew Scarlett impersonated the haircut, at his &#x27;Mad Monday&#x27; celebrations after the 2008 Grand Final.

Bartlett and fellow Richmond legend Matthew Richardson were also featured on an official 2018 recording of &quot;We&#x27;re From Tigerland&quot;.
In 2019, Bartlett departed SEN following a dispute with management. Following this he joined the 3AW football call team as a Sunday caller.

===Return===
Bartlett&#x27;s refusal to return to any Richmond Football Club function, or an official club arrangement lasted from the end of 1991 until 2007. In 2007, he attended a Tommy Hafey Club Function – in support of his lifelong friend Tom Hafey and on 22 November 2007, walked into the Punt Road ground (Richmond&#x27;s home ground) to launch the centenary publication &quot;Richmond F.C: A Century of League Football&quot;, which was written by his son Rhett. It was the first time KB had set foot into Punt Road since his sacking at the end of 1991.

==Recognition==
Bartlett was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1981, and was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame and Richmond Hall of Fame in 1996 and 2002, respectively; he was promoted to &quot;legend&quot; status in the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2000 and to &quot;immortal&quot; status in the Richmond Hall of Fame in 2004. He was also named as part of Richmond&#x27;s team of the century. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2006. On 22 March 2017, a statue of Bartlett was unveiled outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

==Personal life==
Bartlett married Denise Kilcullen, who was a talented runner as a youth, at St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in Ascot Vale on 28 November 1970. They have four children: three daughters – Sharna, Cara and Breanna – and one son, Rhett. All three of the Bartlett daughters starred in track and field during their school days. Rhett is a writer, broadcaster, and historian of the Richmond Football Club, having released books about both his father and the club&#x27;s history, as well as curating the &quot;Tigerland Archive&quot; website.

<doc id="1160310" wikidata="Q3491891" url="?curid=1160310" title="Battle of Komarów">
<text>The Battle of Komarów, or the Zamość Ring, was one of the most important battles of the Polish-Soviet War. It took place between 20 August and 2 September 1920, near the village of Komarowo (now Komarów) near Zamość. It was the last large battle in Europe in which cavalry was used as such and not as mounted infantry.

The battle ended in a disaster for the Soviet 1st Cavalry Army, which sustained heavy casualties and barely avoided being surrounded and destroyed. After the battle, the morale of the 1st Cavalry Army collapsed, and it no longer remained an effective fighting force.

== Eve of the battle ==
After the Battle of Zadwórze, the forces of the Bolshevik 1st Cavalry Army under Semyon Budyonny were halted for over a day. By this time the Russian cavalry units had lost much of their initiative and had not managed to reach or intervene in the Battle of Warsaw. After the Bolsheviks lost the struggle for the capital of Poland and started their retreat eastwards, the forces of Budyonny were ordered by Mikhail Tukhachevsky to march northwards to attack the right flank of Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s advancing forces in order to draw Polish forces away from the north and relieve pressure on the routed Western Army. Tukhachevsky believed that if Polish forces were required to turn south, he could reverse the disaster unfolding in the north and resume his westward offensive to capture Warsaw.

However, heavy fighting in the area of Lwów and the upper Bug River postponed the march. By the time the 1st Cavalry Army reached the area of Zamość on 30 August 1920, the Polish forces had already managed to redirect much of their troops to the area and organize a line of defense.

== Initial clashes ==
On 29 August, the 1st Cavalry Army fought the first battle with units of the Polish 1st Cavalry Division. A small &quot;Special Battalion&quot; led by Major Stanisław Maczek fought a successful delaying action near the village of Waręż. Later that day, the Polish 1st Krechowce Uhlan Regiment chanced upon several unprepared Bolshevik units and took 150 POWs, three pieces of artillery and seven machine guns in the villages of Łykoszyn and Tyszowce.

The following day, the Soviet units continued their advance towards Zamość, but found the Polish mobile defence difficult to break. The garrison of the fortress was composed of a number of units commanded by Captain Mikołaj Bołtuć. Among them were the remnants of Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic Army 6th Infantry Division under Colonel Marko Bezruchko, one regiment and two battalions of Polish infantry, three armoured trains and a number of smaller units, some 700 bayonets and 150 sabres altogether. At the same time, the Polish 1st Cavalry Division moved to the villages of Wolica Brzozowa and Komarów, to the west of the city.

On his arrival in the Zamość area, Budyonny was left with three choices: he could assault the heavily defended city, try to break through the trenches of the 13th Infantry Division in the forests west of it, or try to attack the unknown number of Polish cavalry units some to the west. Despite having little knowledge of the opposing forces, Budyonny did not expect significant opposition just yet and ordered his troops to bypass the city from the west.

== First phase ==
In the early morning of 31 August, a Soviet cavalry brigade crossed the belt of swamps to the north of the Polish positions. At the same time, the 11th Cavalry Division was engaged by Polish infantry in the village of Łubianki, while the 6th Cavalry Division was cut out overnight by Polish infantry to the west of Zamość.

At 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning, the 200 man 2nd Regiment of Grochow Uhlans was ordered to capture &quot;Hill 255&quot; to the north of the main lines of Polish cavalry. The hill was captured with no opposition. Soon afterwards, a large Soviet &quot;tabor&quot; was spotted, disorganised and mixed with a much larger unit of Soviet cavalry. The Polish forces charged, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy rear units. Soon afterwards, the Poles were successfully counter-attacked by Soviet troops and forced to abandon the hill and retreat into the nearby village of Wolica Śniatycka. There the Russian advance was stopped by Polish heavy machine gun fire and at 10 o&#x27;clock the Polish 9th Regiment of Lesser Poland Uhlans under Major (later General) Stefan Dembiński charged the Russian positions and managed to recapture Hill 255. The Russians counterattacked several times, but to no effect.

Meanwhile, the village of Wolica Śniatycka, lost to the Soviet cavalry, was charged by the Polish 8th Uhlan Regiment of Duke Jozef Poniatowski. After a short fight, the disorganised Bolshevik forces were forced to retreat, leaving behind a large part of their heavy equipment and Budyonny&#x27;s staff car. The commander himself evaded being captured. The 4th Cavalry Division was routed.

At 12 o&#x27;clock, the Polish 9th regiment started another charge down the hill on the Soviet 11th Cavalry Division that had replaced the withdrawing 4th Division. The assault was repelled, with heavy casualties on both sides. After approximately 30 minutes, the Soviet forces were forced to retreat; however, the Polish VII Cavalry Brigade was seriously depleted. Also, the 9th Regiment suffered serious casualties from friendly artillery fire.

The Polish VI Cavalry Brigade, until then kept as a reserve, started a pursuit down the hill. After a cavalry charge on the left flank of the withdrawing Bolshevik cavalry, the latter started a disorganised retreat towards Zamość. The pursuit was carried over by the 12th Podolian Uhlan Regiment under Captain (later General) Tadeusz Komorowski. During the retreat, the Poles inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. After the pursuit ended, the fighting was halted until 5 p.m.

== Second phase ==
At approximately 5 p.m., the 8th Regiment near the village of Wolica Śniatycka was yet again assaulted by Soviet cavalry. To counter the threat, Colonel Rómmel ordered the whole VI Cavalry Brigade (1st, 12th and 14th Regiment of Jazlowiec Uhlans) to charge the enemy&#x27;s flank. After a huge clash, the Russian forces in the area fell back northwards.

After a short rest, the whole Soviet 6th Cavalry Division, the strongest unit in the area, managed to finally break through a Polish infantry encirclement and arrived at the battlefield. The Polish VI Brigade was resting in and around the village of Niewirków, where it had withdrawn after the successful pursuit several hours earlier. The VII brigade started its march north-east to join the forces of VI Brigade near Niewirków. Halfway, it spotted a huge Russian line emerging from the forests around Wolica Śniatycka.

The Russian 6th Division (six regiments strong) formed a line, but had not yet initiated an assault. Juliusz Rómmel ordered all his available units to launch an all-out assault before the Russians started their attack. The 8th and 9th Regiments made a frontal charge, while the 1st Krechowce Uhlans Regiment was ordered to attack the left flank of the enemy. Soon it was joined by the remaining elements of the 12th Regiment from Niewirków, charging the enemy positions from the rear. After a 30-minute clash, Budyonny ordered his division to retreat.

The only available way led east, through the positions of the dug-in 2nd Legions Infantry Division under Colonel Michał Łyżwiński. The retreating Soviet forces managed to break through, but suffered heavy casualties. By the end of the day, the battle was over.

== Results and casualties ==

The Polish 1st Cavalry Division then pursued the retreating Soviets. The forces of Budyonny managed to break through Polish lines, but the Poles did not leave them enough time to rest and reorganise. On 2 September the Polish VI Cavalry Brigade reached Łaszczów, where it successfully outflanked the Soviet 44th Rifle Division and annihilated one of its regiments (only 100 POWs survived the battle). The 1st Cavalry Army itself was not surrounded and managed to avoid complete destruction, but it no longer posed a threat to the advancing Poles. Unable to regroup, on 5 September 1920 it lost the town of Hrubieszów, and Włodzimierz Wołyński the following day.

On 12 September 1920, Polish forces withdrawn from the Battle of the Niemen under General Władysław Sikorski started a successful offensive on Soviet-held Volhynia. Pressed from all directions, the 1st Cavalry Army lost Równe on 18 September and was forced to retreat further eastwards. By the end of September, the Polish forces reached the Słucza River, near the lines held by the Soviets before their offensive towards Warsaw started. Soon afterwards, Budyonny&#x27;s Army had to be withdrawn from the front, not to return until after the cease fire that October.

The Battle of Komarów was a disaster for the Russian 1st Cavalry Army. Numerically greatly superior, it failed to concentrate and act as an organised unit, which resulted in several consecutive waves of attacks, each of them repelled by the Polish forces. A lack of communication and disregard for intelligence reports resulted in heavy losses on the Russian side.

The Polish Army lost approximately 500 killed in action and 700 horses. No Poles were taken prisoner by the Red Army. The exact losses of the latter were never made public and are unknown.

Because of the numbers of forces involved, the Battle of Komarów is considered the greatest cavalry battle of the 20th century. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;the greatest cavalry battle after 1813&quot; or the &quot;Miracle at Zamość”, however, the “greatest cavalry battle after 1813” remains an error that is constantly repeated. The Battle of Brandy Station, 1863 had more cavalry forces involved, for example.

<text>The minister of industry is a cabinet position in a government.

The title may refer to the head of the governmental department that specializes in industry. This position may also be responsible for trade and employment, areas that fall under the ministries of commerce and labour in some governments. Depending on the country, the industry minister may have a wide range of responsibilities that could include making decisions regarding utilities and electricity production, presiding over business mergers, and lobbying corporations to build facilities in his or her respective country.

In the United States, industry is the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce, with an Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security specifically tasked with executing policy regarding industry. In the United Kingdom, the minister of industry is called the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, and bears the secondary title President of the Board of Trade.

<text>Michael Ritch (born April 26, 1981, in Tallassee, Alabama) is an American soccer striker, who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

Ritch played college soccer at Auburn University Montgomery in the NAIA from 1999 to 2002, where he helped lead the team to four straight conference championships. Ritch was named a second-team All-American in 2001, and as a senior, after scoring 29 goals with 15 assists in 23 games, he was named a first team All-American. Ritch finished his career at the school with 64 goals and 48 assists.

In December 2002, Ritch was selected as the #1 overall pick in the 2003 A-League College Draft by the Syracuse Salty Dogs. Upon graduating from college, Ritch was drafted 37th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the Columbus Crew, and signed a two-year contract with the club. This made Michael the first ever player drafted in the MLS from the state of Alabama. He only played 21 minutes over three games as a rookie, however in his second year, Ritch appeared in 12 games (4 as a starter) and finished the year with one goal and one assist. In 2003, the Crew sent Ritch on loan to the Salty Dogs for three games.

<text>The minister of Intergovernmental Affairs () is the Minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for the federal government&#x27;s relations with the governments of the provinces and territories of Canada. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs does not head a full-fledged department, but rather directs the Intergovernmental Affairs Secretariat within the Privy Council Office, and ministers have often been assigned additional duties. The current Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is Dominic LeBlanc, who serves concurrently as Minister of Finance.

Prior to the creation of full ministers responsible for this file, prime ministers occasionally appointed Ministers of State for Federal-Provincial Relations. That was the case from 1977 to 1980 and from 1986 to 1991. From 1991 to 1993, the Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs served a similar role focused on intergovernmental negotiation of a package of constitutional reforms. The resulting package, the Charlottetown Accord, was defeated in a 1992 referendum.

Several provincial governments, such as Ontario, Manitoba, and Quebec, have also created homologous ministerial positions responsible for relations with other provinces and the federal government.

<doc id="1160318" wikidata="Q491158" url="?curid=1160318" title="Revisionist Western">
<text>The revisionist Western is a sub-genre of the Western fiction. Called a post-classical variation of the traditional Western, the revisionist subverts the myth and romance of the traditional by means of character development and realism to present a less simplistic view of life in the &quot;Old West&quot;. While the traditional Western always embodies a clear boundary between good and evil, the revisionist Western does not.

Revisionist themes have existed since the early 20th century but it was not until 1968, when the Hays Code restrictions were relaxed, that revisionism finally supplanted the traditional. Although many earlier Westerns are labelled as revisionist, the distinction between them is often blurred by variable themes and plot devices. Some are labelled psychological Westerns, which is closely related to and sometimes overlaps with the psychological drama and psychological thriller genres because of their focus on character, at the expense of the action and thrills that predominate in the traditional. Other revisionist films, in which action and adventure remain prominent, are labelled Indian Westerns or outlaw/gunfighter Westerns because, instead of the traditional hero, the protagonist is a Native American, an outlaw, or a gunfighter. The term anti-Western is generally used in reference to particularly gruesome and/or nihilistic examples of the genre. The spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s, not bound by the Hays Code, were strongly revisionist by presenting morally ambiguous stories featuring an anti-hero or a sympathetic villain. From 1969, revisionism has prevailed in Western film production.

==Concept==
The traditional Western typically features a strong male lead character, often a lawman or cavalry officer, who takes direct action on behalf of supposedly civilized people against those deemed to be uncivilized (&quot;see also&quot;: Civilizing mission). The former are portrayed as honest townsfolk or travelers, and the latter as outlaws or hostile Native Americans.

In the revisionist Western, the traditional format and themes are subverted by such devices as the Native American protagonist; strong female characters; the outlaw protagonist; plots that are pre-eminently concerned with survival in a wild environment; or the presentation of a morally ambiguous storyline without definite heroes, these often featuring the so-called anti-hero or a sympathetic villain. The object is to blur the traditionally clear boundaries between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; (the &quot;good guy&quot; against the &quot;bad guy&quot;) by emphasizing the need for survival amidst ambiguity.

The traditional Western treats characters in simplistic terms as good or bad with minimal character development. The psychological Western, which began in the 1940s and was hugely popular through the 1950s and 1960s, prioritizes character development ahead of action whilst retaining most of the traditional aspects. For the most part, the psychological Western morphed into the revisionist Western as censorship restrictions were relaxed and removed in the 1960s.

&quot;Shane&quot; (1953), directed by George Stevens, is a psychological Western. The title character (Alan Ladd) seems at first to be a traditional Western drifter riding across a traditional Western landscape but it is soon apparent that he has entered a complex setting which is populated by, as Kim Newman puts it, &quot;believable characters with mixed motives&quot;. Even though rancher Ryker (Emile Meyer) is ostensibly the villain of the piece, he makes the point that he has striven for thirty years to develop the cattle range which is now being taken over by fence-building &quot;sodbusters&quot;, many of whom have the mixed motives noted by Newman. Despite the complexity of its characters, &quot;Shane&quot; is nevertheless filmed in a conventional setting and ends with the hero outshooting and killing the three main villains. There is, however, an element of revisionism in the ending when the disillusioned Shane admits to Ryker that he knows his day as a gunfighter is over. Shane rides away to an uncertain future, possibly to die (he is wounded), and it is farmer Starrett (Van Heflin) and his family who endure.

Fifteen years after Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Shane&quot;, Sergio Leone directed &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, a revisionist Western which completely subverts the traditional with complex characters and multiple plot devices, the key one being revenge – the motive of enigmatic gunfighter Harmonica (Charles Bronson). As in &quot;Shane&quot;, it is not the gunfighters who &quot;inherit the West&quot; but in this case the compassionate town-building ex-prostitute Jill (Claudia Cardinale). By the end of the film, all of the antagonists except Harmonica are dead and, like Shane, he rides away to an uncertain future.

==Development==
Opinion is divided on the origin of the revisionist or psychological Western but it is generally agreed that there were hints of a darker perspective in some films of the 1930s such as &quot;Westward Ho&quot; (1935), directed by Robert N. Bradbury and starring John Wayne, in which the hero leads a band of vigilantes on a quest for revenge. &quot;Westward Ho&quot; is the earliest film in AllMovie&#x27;s list of revisionist Westerns. The earliest films classified by AllMovie as psychological Westerns are &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; and &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (both 1943).

The Outlaw/Gunfighter sub-genre focused on outlaws and gunfighters as human beings rather than using them as stock characters, often dressed in black, as in traditional Westerns. The aim was to examine the impact of gunfights on the participants by revealing their neuroses and redeeming characteristics. AllMovie&#x27;s earliest films of this type are two silents: &quot;The Road Agent&quot; (1926), directed by J. P. McGowan and starring Al Hoxie; and &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1927), directed by Lloyd Ingraham and starring Fred Thomson.

In a similar vein, the Indian Western seeks to reverse negative stereotypes by sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans who, in the traditional Western, are nearly always the enemy of the &quot;heroic&quot; white settlers and cavalry. In the Indian Western, roles can be reversed with peaceful Native Americans driven to fight against white aggression. Usually, however, the Native American hero or heroine is played by brownface whites such as Burt Lancaster and Jean Peters in &quot;Apache&quot; (1954). In &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;, the female lead was Mary McDonnell playing a white who had been raised by the Lakota. There had been earlier films which portrayed Native Americans sympathetically, but the breakthrough for this sub-genre was &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950), directed by Delmer Daves and starring James Stewart, with Jeff Chandler as Cochise. Kim Newman wrote that Chandler&#x27;s performance established Cochise as &quot;the 1950s model of an Indian hero&quot; and the film inspired goodwill to other Native American chiefs such as Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Geronimo – as a result, &quot;it became fashionable for Westerns to be pro-Indian&quot;.

Many of the films were produced in the 1950s during the milieu of McCarthyism and attempted to strike back against blacklisting of the film industry at that time, notably &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) starring Gary Cooper. By the time of the loosening, and later abandonment, of the restrictive Hays Code in the 1960s, many directors of the New Hollywood generation such as Sam Peckinpah, George Roy Hill, and Robert Altman focused on the Western and each produced their own classics in the genre, including Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), Hill&#x27;s &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), and Altman&#x27;s &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971).

Meanwhile, European directors such as Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci had been making Western films unencumbered by American expectations nor Hays Code inspired censorship, and these spaghetti Westerns also provided a new perspective on the Western genre. Early examples of this sub-genre are Leone&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, starring Clint Eastwood, and Corbucci&#x27;s &quot;Minnesota Clay&quot;, starring Cameron Mitchell, both made in 1964.

The revisionist and psychological Westerns have been carried forward from their own standard settings into the neo-Western, a notable of which is the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007), based on the work of Cormac McCarthy, an author known for writing revisionist Western literature, such as the novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;.

==Spaghetti Westerns==

European countries, which had imported Western productions since their silent film inception, began creating their own versions and, in 1964, Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; became an international hit initiating the spaghetti Western filone. Although they were mostly shot in Spanish locations, featured U.S. actors, and were co-produced by European and U.S. producers, many of the most successful directors were Italian, resulting in these films being known by the misnomer Spaghetti Western. Leone is often credited with initiating the growth of these co-produced European Westerns as he played a seminal role due to the financial success of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars.&quot; Scholars such as Austin Fisher have begun to pay attention to how in this popular genre Italian directors such as Damiano Damiani, Sergio Sollima and Sergio Corbucci, in responding to international and national events, chose the Western as a way to represent Leftist doctrine in the second half of the 1960s, interpreting the conflict between Mexico and the U.S. through the lens of Italian politics. Leone popularized the morally ambivalent gunfighter through his representation of &quot;The Man with No Name,&quot; Clint Eastwood&#x27;s gritty anti-hero who was copied again and again in Spaghetti Westerns in characters such as Django and Ringo and which came to be one of its universal attributes.

==Counterculture==
Beginning in the late 1960s, independent filmmakers produced revisionist and hallucinogenic films, later retroactively identified as the separate but related subgenre of &quot;acid Westerns,” that radically turn the usual trappings of the Western genre inside out to critique both capitalism and the counterculture. Monte Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Shooting&quot; and &quot;Ride in the Whirlwind&quot; (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;El Topo&quot; (1970), Roland Klick&#x27;s &quot;Deadlock&quot; (1970), Robert Downey Sr.&#x27;s &quot;Greaser&#x27;s Palace&quot; (1972), Alex Cox&#x27;s &quot;Walker&quot; (1987), and Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995) fall into this category. Films made during the early 1970s are particularly noted for their hyper-realistic photography and production design. Other films, such as those directed by Clint Eastwood, were made by professionals familiar with the Western as a criticism and expansion against and beyond the genre. Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976) and &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992) made use of strong supporting roles for women and Native Americans.

==List of revisionist Western films==

This list is not exhaustive. It includes major films labelled revisionist Western, anti-Western, psychological Western, Indian Western, outlaw Western, gunfighter Western, or spaghetti Western. By 1970, revisionism had supplanted the traditional as the predominant Western sub-genre and so the list highlights the films released until then to illustrate the development of the concept.

<text>Devin Barclay (born April 9, 1983) is a former American football placekicker for The Ohio State Buckeyes. Prior to that, he was formerly a professional soccer player, who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

==Biography==
Barclay initially skipped college, opting instead to sign a Project-40 contract with MLS in 2001, at the age of 18, which allocated him to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Barclay made a significant impact on a very bad Mutiny team as a rookie, appearing in 23 games, 12 starts, and scoring three goals and two assists. The Mutiny was contracted after the 2001 season; Barclay was selected 8th overall in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft by the San Jose Earthquakes. Barclay did not make much of an impact on the side that had just won MLS Cup, disappointingly only appearing in 12 games, and registering no goals or assists. He was traded to D.C. United in exchange for a draft pick, but disappointed in D.C. as well; he only appeared in three games for United, as coach Ray Hudson preferred not to play young players. He was again traded after the 2003 season, joining the Columbus Crew, his fourth team in four seasons. He made little impact on the Crew, however, again appearing in only three games in 2004. After appearing only once in the 2005 season, Barclay was released by Columbus on November 15, 2005.

Barclay represented the U.S. national team at the Under-18, Under-20, and Under-23 levels, but his playing time with those teams dwindled as he was unable to break into an MLS side.

Stifled by the lack of playing time and hampered by injuries, Barclay retired from soccer. He began learning how to kick field goals and was able to walk on at Ohio State University. As a junior, Barclay was second on the placekicking depth chart at Ohio State until Aaron Pettrey was injured on October 31, 2009, in a game against New Mexico State. Barclay became the starting kicker going forward.

He scored the conference championship winning kick against the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 14, 2009. The win meant that Ohio State would play in the Rose Bowl, as well as ensuring Ohio State at least a share of the 2009 Big Ten Championship.

Barclay started off the 2010 season well, tying the Ohio State record with 5 field goals on 6 attempts in week 2 against the University of Miami. He was named the Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week for his efforts. He would finish the season 20-for-24 on field goals. Barclay never missed a point after touchdown in his career as a Buckeye.

Now, Devin working at Nike as men&#x27;s soccer athlete manager, before was the director of coaching at the Colorado Rush soccer team.

<text>The Lapis Satricanus (&quot;Stone of Satricum&quot;), is a yellow stone found in the ruins of the ancient town of Satricum, near Borgo Montello (), a village of southern Lazio, dated late 6th to early 5th centuries BC. It was found in 1977 during excavations by C.M. Stibbe.

== Historical context ==
The &quot;Lapis Satricanus&quot; is an ancient Latin inscription found in Satricum, a settlement in the region of Latium, dating back to the early 5th century BCE. This period in Roman history is critical for understanding the transition from the Roman monarchy to the early Republic. Satricum was one of several Latin settlements that played a significant role in the early territorial expansion of Rome and its interactions with neighboring tribes and cities, including the Volsci and the Aequi. The inscription provides evidence for early Latin language use and the sociopolitical structure of the region during this period .

Discovered in the 1970s, the &quot;Lapis Satricanus&quot; is notable for mentioning a &quot;Publius Valerius&quot;, which some scholars believe refers to Publius Valerius Publicola, an important figure during the establishment of the Roman Republic. However, there is ongoing debate among historians regarding whether this is the same person or another individual bearing the same name .

Linguistically, the inscription sheds light on the development of early Latin epigraphy. It follows forms and structures common to the archaic period, helping linguists trace the evolution of the Latin language. The text also indicates the influence of Roman political power over nearby Latin towns, showing the growing dominance of Rome in the region.

== Content ==
It reads:

: &quot;(?)IEI STETERAI POPLIOSIO VALESIOSIO&quot;
: &quot;SVODALES MAMARTEI&quot;

(&quot;The (?) dedicated this, as companions of Publius Valerius, to Mars&quot;)

== Points of interest ==

=== Old Latin origins ===
This inscription has attracted attention for several reasons. Its language has been identified as Old Latin or a closely related dialect. It is important for comparative Indo-European grammar, as it is the only Latin inscription to show the ending &quot;-osio&quot; for the genitive singular of the thematic noun declension. Latin later has &quot;-ī&quot; as the ending for this case, but by comparison with Sanskrit, Mycenaean and Homeric Greek and other languages, it becomes clear that &quot;-osio&quot; is a far earlier form.

=== Usage of word &quot;suodales&quot; ===

Another point of interest is the presence of the word &quot;suodales&quot; (Classical Latin &quot;sodales&quot;). In historic times, this word referred to a member of a &quot;sodalitas&quot;, a religious fraternity or brotherhood who met for ritual meals or as a burial organization. &quot;Since the &quot;suod-&quot; element in &quot;suodales&quot; is cognate with the English word &#x27;swear&#x27;&quot;, writes Gary Forsythe, &quot;the term suggests that some kind of oath was taken, binding the members of the group together in a common purpose.&quot; Forsythe uses this and that this was a dedication to Mars to suggest this indicates the existence of an armed group of sworn followers, similar to &quot;the war bands led by Homeric heroes, the warlike aristocratic companions of the Macedonian kings during the classical period, and the war bands surrounding the Celtic and Germanic chieftains described by Caesar and Tacitus&quot;. Forsythe notes this puts a new light on the account of the Battle of the Cremera, an event where the entire gens Fabia fought as a group the armed men of the rival town of Veii only to be tragically defeated.

=== Inscribed names ===
A third point of interest to historians and archaeologists of early Latium is the name preserved on the inscription. The archaic name of Poplios Valesios is rendered in Classical Latin as &quot;Publius Valerius&quot;. That has led to speculation that the inscription refers to Publius Valerius Publicola, the patrician ally of Lucius Junius Brutus who dominates the list of early consuls recorded by the &quot;Fasti Capitolini&quot; and is credited, in traditional accounts, as one of the primary founders of the Roman Republic. Positive identification is at least somewhat problematic because the town of Satricum was not part of Roman territory during the Publius Valerius tenure. However, the &quot;lapis&quot; itself may not have been dedicated in Satricum in the first place since it was found as part of a collection of recycled material used in the construction of a temple in the town, and it could well have been imported from elsewhere.

<text>John Russell Carnahan (; born July 10, 1958) is an American politician from the state of Missouri. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 to 2013.

At the time, the district included the southern third of the city of St. Louis (known as South City) and most of the southern St. Louis suburbs including most of Jefferson County and all of Ste. Genevieve County. Some cities located in the district include: Webster Groves, Mehlville, Affton, and Oakville, and the southern suburbs of Arnold, Herculaneum, Pevely, Crystal City, Barnhart, Imperial, and Festus, as well as Ste. Genevieve in the neighboring Ste. Genevieve County.

Dramatic losses in population in St. Louis in the 2010 Census contributed to Missouri losing a Congressional seat effective 2013. In the re-mapping of the state&#x27;s congressional districts, Carnahan&#x27;s district was dismantled. The bulk of the district, including Carnahan&#x27;s home, was drawn into Missouri&#x27;s 1st congressional district. The move placed Carnahan and William Lacy Clay Jr. in the same district; Carnahan lost the primary to Clay for the seat on August 7, 2012.

As of 2023, he is the Chair of the Missouri Democratic Party.

==Early life, education and career==
John Russell Carnahan was born in 1958 in Columbia, Missouri, and raised in Rolla. He is the son of the late Mel Carnahan, the former Governor of Missouri and posthumous U.S. Senator-elect, and Jean Carnahan (née Carpenter), who was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the seat to which her husband was posthumously elected.

His grandfather, A. S. J. Carnahan, served in Congress for seven terms, and also as U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone. Russ Carnahan is a recipient of the Eagle Scout Award. His sister Robin Carnahan was elected to the office of secretary state in 2004 and again in 2008 in which she received the most votes cast for a single candidate in the state&#x27;s history. His brother Randy was killed in the same plane crash that took the life of his father. Russ Carnahan received a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Missouri. He worked as a private practice attorney prior to entering politics.

Missouri Republicans criticized Carnahan&#x27;s vote, noting that passage of the bill resulted in $107 million in federal funding for Lost Creek Wind Farm, an alternative energy facility owned by Russ Carnahan&#x27;s brother, Tom Carnahan.
Environment &amp; Energy: Carnahan supported the regulation and enforcements of both the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. He supported further development and use of alternative fuels as well as the development of traditional energy resources, such as coal and natural gas. Carnahan also wanted to strengthen emission controls on all gasoline and diesel-powered engines, including cars, trucks, and SUVs. He has supported tax credits to consumers and manufacturers of hybrid vehicles. In addition, he supported international voluntary and mandatory emission targets to limit global warming.
Carnahan has supported the interests of groups trying to protect the environment, such as the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund. Russ Carnahan voted in favor of H.R. 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 also known as the Cap and Trade bill or Waxman/Markey act.

Health: Recently, Carnahan voted against a Health Care and Insurance Law amendment that would prohibit federal funding of abortion services. He supports the interests of pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.
Carnahan wants tax credits to be offered to individuals and small businesses to offset the cost of insurance. He also supports the importation of prescription drugs to the U.S., and wants to expand prescription drug coverage under Medicare so that more people can be covered. Carnahan would also like child healthcare programs to be expanded so that more children can be covered. Carnahan voted in favor of H.R. 3962: Affordable Health Care for America Act in 2009,

Foreign Policy In January 2010, Carnahan partnered with Republican Congressman Joseph Cao of Louisiana to create the American Engagement Caucus, its stated purpose being the promotion of a multilateral foreign policy in which the United States works closely with other countries to address global problems. As a joint editorial between the two congressmen stated, &quot;We live in an age of interdependence. America&#x27;s security, economic, environmental, and moral interests are inextricably linked with those of the international community. Simply put, it is in our vital national interest to support international engagement.&quot;. He has since introduced multiple other bills related to science diplomacy.

Guns The NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) rated Carnahan an &quot;F&quot; in 2004 and 2010. Robin Carnahan, Russ&#x27;s sister also has an F rating with the NRA-PVF, who backed her opponent in the 2004 election for Missouri Secretary of State. In 2016 during his run for Lt. Governor, Carnahan said,&quot;I&#x27;m a member of the NRA as well as a Democrat. Democrat or Republican, no decision is going to be made to be harmful to the people.&quot;

==Political campaigns==

Carnahan&#x27;s first campaign for political office was in 1990, when he unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the 8th Congressional District against Republican U.S. Representative Bill Emerson, losing by 14 points, 57% to 43%. His grandfather had previously represented much of this district&#x27;s western portion for all but two years from 1947 to 1961.

Prior to challenging Emerson, by his own telling the then-32-year-old Carnahan had already &quot;been active in government and politics for most of my adult life.&quot; Carnahan was active in several of his late father&#x27;s political campaigns, including successful bids for state treasurer (1980) and lieutenant governor (1988), and an unsuccessful race for governor (1984). In January 1980, Carnahan slept for five days on the floor outside the Secretary of State&#x27;s Office in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, to ensure that his father&#x27;s name would be first on the ballot for Missouri State Treasurer when filing opened on January 8. Said Carnahan, &quot;A lot of people get football tickets this way. It&#x27;s going to be a long five days, so I guess we&#x27;ll get some sleeping bags and a TV in here.&quot; And in 1984, when his father ran for state treasurer, Carnahan made stump speeches for him across Missouri. Carnahan also had already worked for Missouri House Speaker Bob F. Griffin, Missouri Secretary of State Jim Kirkpatrick, and Missouri House Majority Leader Tony Ribaudo; had served on the executive committee of the Missouri Democratic Party; and, was the deputy Missouri campaign manager for Dick Gephardt&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign.

In his race against Emerson, one newspaper remarked &quot;on Carnahan&#x27;s tactics of deliberate misinformation and distortion of facts&quot; and his &quot;negative and demagogic approach to the 8th District race.&quot; The &quot;Sikeston Standard-Democrat&quot; said, &quot;Democrat Russ Carnahan has brought more mud into a congressional campaign than the days of Bill D. Burlison.&quot; According to the &quot;Rolla Daily News&quot;, &quot;We have already heard enough from Carnahan, whose loose interpretation of Mr. Emerson&#x27;s record is grossly misleading. Mostly B.S., in other words. Couple that with Carnahan&#x27;s wild accusations of what Emerson is to be blamed for, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Carnahan doesn&#x27;t soon attribute Missouri&#x27;s recent fifth-down loss to Colorado to Emerson.&quot; Responding to this criticism, Carnahan alleged &quot;that the Sowers family, which publishes the &quot;Rolla Daily News&quot;, has endorsed Emerson because the congressman rents district office space from the family.&quot; The &quot;Southeast Missourian&quot; described Carnahan&#x27;s claim as &quot;amateurish.&quot; In the final days of the campaign, &quot;frustrated by ads being run by [Emerson],&quot; Carnahan &quot;lashed back by calling Emerson a &#x27;damn liar.&#x27;&quot; Emerson defeated Carnahan, 57% to 43%.

Carnahan considered running against Emerson again in 1994, but ultimately &quot;decided 1994 was not the time.&quot; He then moved to St. Louis, where in 2000 he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. He narrowly defeated political activist Jeanette Mott Oxford in the Democratic primary election by a scant 64 votes but went on to win the general election by a wide margin. He was reelected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2002.
In 2004, Carnahan ran for the 3rd Congressional District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives which was vacated by retiring U.S. Representative and former House Minority Leader and co-founder of the New Democratic Coalition Dick Gephardt. Carnahan narrowly won a crowded primary field of ten Democratic candidates in 2004 with 22.9 percent of the vote, finishing with less than 1,800 votes ahead of his nearest rival, political activist Jeff Smith, who garnered 21.3 percent. In the general election Carnahan faced Republican candidate William J. Federer, an author and Religious Right activist who had previously run against Gephardt on several occasions. The election was somewhat closer than expected. However, St. Louis&#x27;s strong Democratic tilt (a Republican had not represented this district or its predecessors since 1953) helped Carnahan win with 53 percent of the vote. The district reverted to form in 2006 and Carnahan was reelected with 65 percent of the vote.

===2008===
===2010===

Carnahan won re-election over Republican nominee Edward Martin Jr., Constitution Party nominee Nick Ivanovich, and Libertarian nominee Steven Hedrick. Brian Wallner qualified as a write-in candidate.

===2012===

During his time in Congress, Carnahan represented the southern third of St. Louis City, as well as much of southern St. Louis County and all of Jefferson and Ste. Genevieve counties. However, Missouri was due to lose a district after the 2010 census revealed sluggish population growth in Missouri, particularly in St. Louis.

On May 4, 2011, the Missouri Legislature overrode Governor Jay Nixon&#x27;s veto of the proposed elimination of the 3rd District, by a 109-44 vote in the Missouri House, and 28-6 in the Missouri Senate. The new map merged all of St. Louis, including Carnahan&#x27;s home, into the 1st District, represented by six-term Democrat Lacy Clay.

Carnahan challenged Clay in the primary for the redrawn 1st on August 7, 2012–the real contest in this heavily Democratic district–and lost by a landslide, 63% to 34%.

Carnahan was mentioned as a possible candidate to fill a vacancy in the 8th District after Rep. Jo Ann Emerson stepped down in 2013.

===2016===

Carnahan was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. &quot;Many of you have consistently encouraged me to continue serving our state in new ways — especially at a time when so many of our state officials are so very disconnected from the everyday needs and aspirations of Missourians,&quot; he wrote. He lost the general election to Republican Mike Parson.

<doc id="1160355" wikidata="Q723617" url="?curid=1160355" title="John Kirwan (rugby)">
<text>Sir John James Patrick Kirwan (born 16 December 1964) is a New Zealand mental health advocate, former rugby union and rugby league player, and former rugby union coach.

A wing, he played for Auckland in the 1980s and 1990s, when they dominated New Zealand rugby. He played in 63 tests for New Zealand, and scored 35 tries, making him one of the highest try scorers in international rugby union history. He was part of the New Zealand team that won the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. He also played rugby league for the Auckland Warriors in their first two seasons in 1995 and 1996.

After retiring, he moved into coaching, and was the head coach of Japanese club NEC, the Italy and Japan national teams, and the Blues in Super Rugby, until he stepped down in 2015.

He has written two books on the subject of mental health, has spoken openly about his battles with depression and been honoured for his services to mental health.

==Early life and family==
Kirwan was born in Auckland on 16 December 1964, the son of Patrick and Patricia Madeline Kirwan. He was educated at De La Salle College in Auckland.

His paternal grandfather, Jack Kirwan, was a wing three-quarter/five-eighths originally from Reefton who played for the New Zealand rugby league team on 28 occasions.

==Playing career==
===Rugby union===
Kirwan played for Marist Brothers Old Boys RFC and Auckland domestically, winning 142 caps with the latter during an era when the side dominated the NPC and Ranfurly Shield.

From 1985 to 1989 he also played in Italy, with Benetton Treviso, where he won the Italian championship in 1989. Also in the Treviso team was the All Black Craig Green, Kirwan&#x27;s teammate in the 1987 World Cup won by New Zealand.

After his spell in rugby league, he finished his rugby union playing career with NEC in Japan from 1997 to 1999.

====International====
Kirwan played 63 test matches for New Zealand from 1984 until 1994. Kirwan played a major role in the All Blacks&#x27; 23-test unbeaten run from 1987 to 1990, including winning the 1987 World Cup. He scored 10 tries in five tests against Wales and Australia during 1988. In all he scored 35 test tries for New Zealand. He also scored 67 tries in all appearances with the All Blacks (including non test matches) which is still the national record. His total of 199 first class tries remains a New Zealand record.

Kirwan was selected as one of the &quot;Five players of the year&quot; for the 1985,1986, 1987 and 1988 seasons, in the Rugby Almanack of New Zealand.

In 1986 Kirwan and David Kirk were the only All Blacks not to join the &#x27;rebel&#x27; New Zealand Cavaliers team that travelled to apartheid-era South Africa after a New Zealand court held that the All Blacks&#x27; playing in that country would be inconsistent with their mission of promoting rugby. As a result, he and Kirk were the only ones not barred from playing with the All Blacks after the tour.

===Rugby league===
At age 30 Kirwan signed for the newly formed rugby league club Auckland Warriors for the 1995 ARL season, with a mutual option for 1996. Playing on the wing, Kirwan was the Warriors&#x27; top try scorer in the 1996 season. He was a staunch opponent of the ARL during the Super League war.

==Coaching career==

Kirwan coached NEC Green Rockets in Japan, and in 2001 became an assistant coach with the Auckland Blues.

In 2002, he moved to Italy to become the coach of the Italy national team, which under his guidance recorded two victories over Wales in 2003 and Scotland in 2004. After a winless 2005 Six Nations campaign, he was dismissed on 8 April 2005. He continued to work as a consultant with NEC.

At the start of 2007 he was appointed the coach of the Japan national rugby union team. Kirwan said: &quot;The level of rugby has improved greatly in Japan in the last ten years and they did well at the last World Cup. But their recent performances at national level have [not been good]. I want to find that &#x27;Samurai Spirit&#x27; that all the players can identify with. And then that style of rugby can start to spread downwards throughout the country.&quot; At the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Japan drew 12–12 with Canada, breaking a 16-year, 13-match losing streak at World Cups. Kirwan remained head coach of Japan through the 2011 Rugby World Cup, when they again drew with Canada, but lost to New Zealand, France and Tonga.

In July 2012, Kirwan was announced as the new coach of the Blues. In the 2013 and 2014 seasons, the Blues finished in 10th place. After re-applying for the role for 2016 and beyond, he was forced to step down following just three wins - an all-time franchise low - in the 2015 season. In 2018 he stated that he is not likely to coach again.

==Health==
Kirwan has openly spoken of his battle with depression, and is actively involved in mental health and depression awareness campaigns in New Zealand. He has written about his depression in the books &quot;All Blacks Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

He established the Sir John Kirwan Foundation to help young people understand mental health. In 2020, he launched a mental wellbeing app called Mentemia.

==Personal life==
Kirwan is married to Fiorella, Lady Kirwan, and they have three children: Francesca, a beach volleyball player; Niko, who has played football for the All Whites, New Zealand&#x27;s national team, and Luca, who has represented New Zealand internationally in rowing at under-23 level. Kirwan speaks fluent Italian and good Japanese, having lived in Italy and Japan.

In 2016, Kirwan&#x27;s DNA heritage was investigated for a television programme, in which links to the Irish-American Kennedy family and Scottish mountaineer Alexander Kellas were shown.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1989 New Year Honours, Kirwan was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby.

In the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Kirwan was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to mental health. In the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours, he was promoted to Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to mental health and rugby.

Also in 2012, Kirwan was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>In music, a chorale concerto is a short sacred composition for one or more voices and instruments, principally from the very early German Baroque era. Most examples of the genre were composed between 1600 and 1650.

== Description ==

This use of the word &quot;concerto&quot; differs considerably from the more modern, and considerably more common usage: in the early Baroque the word meant vocal music accompanied by instruments, specifically in concertato style. The concertato style was brought north across the Alps by composers such as Hans Leo Hassler and Heinrich Schütz, who studied in Venice with the originators of the style, the Venetian School composers including Giovanni Gabrieli. Hassler, Schütz and others then applied their newly learned techniques to the German chorale to create a form roughly equivalent in expression and purpose to the motet which in the preceding Renaissance era was used in Roman Catholic context. The Protestant Reformation made necessary the development of new genres of music, most of which were related in form and function to equivalent genres in Roman Catholic parts of Europe, but which avoided the use of Gregorian Chant, using the chorale instead (many chorale tunes of which were derived directly from chant, but fitted with words in German). A chorale concerto is a sacred concerto based on a Lutheran chorale.

There were two basic types of chorale concerto:

# A simple composition for voice and basso continuo, sometimes with an obbligato solo instrument;
# A more elaborate polychoral setting, directly related to the music of the Venetian School, and often modeled after the work of Giovanni Gabrieli.

The chorale cantata, culminating in the works of J.S. Bach, evolved out of the chorale concerto, and became a popular liturgical form in Germany for more than a hundred years.

<text>Robert Mendel Laxer (September 10, 1915 – October 24, 1998) was a Canadian psychologist, professor, author, and political activist.

==Life and career==
Laxer was born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1915 and graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1936 and a Master of Arts degree in 1939.

Laxer joined the Communist Party of Canada during the Great Depression. He worked as a freelance journalist until 1941 when he joined the Canadian Army and served during the Second World War. Upon returning to Canada in 1947, he became a paid organizer for the Communist Party&#x27;s successor, the Labor-Progressive Party. Following the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the accusations by Nikita Khrushchev of crimes by Joseph Stalin, and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, Laxer joined many other disillusioned Communists in resigning from the party.

He returned to school and ultimately obtained a doctorate in clinical and learning psychology from the University of Toronto. From 1960 to 1964, he was a lecturer in the University of Toronto&#x27;s department of psychology and a clinical psychologist at Toronto General Hospital.

He then taught at York University, and later became an associate professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and became a full professor in 1968.

In 1969, he joined his son, James Laxer, and Mel Watkins to form the Waffle, a socialist group within the New Democratic Party. Through the 1970s, he wrote numerous articles and books advocating Canadian economic independence from the United States and, in particular, Canadian ownership of the oil industry. He was appointed by Pierre Trudeau to the board of directors of Petro-Canada which had been created as a state-owned crown corporation, in part, due to Laxer&#x27;s arguments.
In the 1980s, Laxer was active in the Council of Canadians, the peace movement, and as an opponent of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.

Laxer had two sons, James and Gordon, both of whom were political economists and writers, and a daughter, Linda, a social worker and therapist. James&#x27; son Michael Laxer also became a political activist.

<doc id="1160381" wikidata="Q5656653" url="?curid=1160381" title="List of hardy palms">
<text>Hardy palms are any of the species of palm (Arecaceae) that are able to withstand brief periods of colder temperatures and even occasional snowfall. A few palms are native to higher elevations of South Asia where true winter conditions occur, while a few others are native to the warmer parts of the temperate zone in southern Europe, and others are native throughout temperate and subtropical locales in the Americas and Oceania. A few of these temperate climate palms can tolerate hard freezes with little or no damage. Many of these &quot;hardy&quot; species can be cultivated in warmer parts of temperate and subtropical climates.

The cold hardiness of palms varies by species. The hardiest species are found in the tribe Trachycarpeae, &quot;Washingtonia,&quot; and &quot;Rhapis&quot;, with species which are found in the wild in areas where the mean temperature of the coldest month of the year is not much less than , and &quot;Trachycarpus&quot;, with species which are found in the wild in areas where the mean temperature of the coldest month of the year is as low as . Members of the above palms and other genera are sometimes grown in areas where they are not truly hardy, overwintering with the aid of various kinds of artificial protection.

==Fan palms==

The fan palms (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae; palms with fan-shaped leaves) include all of the hardiest palms.
*Windmill palms (&quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot;, &quot;T. takil&quot;) – Considered the most cold hardy arborescent palms in the world. These tough species are native to eastern China, Myanmar, and the Himalayas where severe (though brief) winter conditions occur. Hardy to about unprotected, with exceptional tolerance reaching near , they grow at high altitudes where temperatures are cool. It is also tolerant of low summer temperatures. Mature specimens can also be found in the southern coast of Ireland, the southern coast of England, southwestern Canada (in the city of Vancouver and on Vancouver Island), southern Switzerland (Ticino). &quot;Trachycarpus&quot; is also grown extensively in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. and along the Atlantic coast as far north as southern Connecticut. Large mature specimens can be found from Maryland south to Georgia, though numbers decline toward southern Georgia south toward Florida, where native palms exist. Across the interior of the United States, there are reports of long term specimens that have survived north to the Ohio River, with several long term plantings in the higher elevations of Tennessee and western North Carolina. It is rated as winter hardy to USDA zone 7. Windmill palms are the most cold and cool summer hardy of all the palms, although absolute minimum temperature may be exceeded by needle palms, &quot;Sabal minor&quot;, as well as very brief nighttime cold exposure to desert palms. For instance, on the northern coast of Estonia, in hardiness zone 6, individual &quot; Trachycarpus fortuneis&quot; are also grown.
*Bismarck palm (&quot;Bismarckia nobilis&quot;) – Native to the island of Madagascar off the east coast of Africa, this cold hardy palm is among the most sought-after palms for ornamentals in Florida, mainly due to its unique grey color and ability to withstand temperatures down to ; thus, it thrives in any subtropical environment. It can be found in states such as Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas. It is a very fast growing palm, and can go from in just 5 years under the right conditions. During late spring the tree will produce small, fragrant flowers. Once fully matured, it can reach heights of up to in the wild; however, most do not exceed . This palm produces sharp thorns on the frond stalks, so one must take proper precautions while pruning.

*Mediterranean fan palm (&quot;Chamaerops humilis&quot;) – The only palm native to southern Europe besides the Cretan date palm, it is very drought-tolerant and hardy to , but does prefer hot summers. Despite the fact that this palm is less hardy than many palms listed here, it has the northernmost native habitat. It is rated as winter hardy to USDA zone 8. It is found in abundance across most of southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa. It is a very slow-growing plant. The blue form of the species (cerifera), native to high elevations of the Atlas Mountains, has recently been introduced into the trade and early reports indicate that it may be or more degrees hardier than the green form.

*Needle palm (&quot;Rhapidophyllum hystrix&quot;) – This clustering and usually trunkless palm is native to the subtropical southeastern United States, from central Florida to Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama in the United States. It is considered hardy to -20 C (-5 F), and is cultivated along the East Coast from Florida to southern Massachusetts, and along the West Coast from California to Seattle. They have proven hardy in the Tennessee Valley region and up into the lower Ohio Valley. The needle palm is very slow-growing and rarely reaches heights of over , though very old specimens in the deep south can reach in height and width. There are documented specimens that have been growing in White County, Tennessee, since the early part of the 1960s, as well as the United States National Arboretum in the city of Washington D.C., that are at in height.

*Mazari palm (&quot;Nannorrhops richtiana&quot;) – This palm, native to the dry, mountainous terrains of northern Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and surrounding regions, is also thought to be extremely cold hardy (perhaps to about ), though also requiring hot summers and dry soils. However, due to its limited availability in cultivation, not much is known about this palm. Mazari palm is not easy to grow; perfect drainage and full sun are required for this palm to survive. This palm will not tolerate wet freezes.

*Saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;) – These palms are native to Florida and coastal areas from South Carolina to Louisiana. They are found in various pine-dominated habitats (such as Longleaf pine ecosystem, Loblolly pine areas, and South Florida pine flatwoods), and in scrub, dry hammocks, and dry and wet prairie.

*&quot;Sabal&quot; palms (palmettos; 13 species) – These palms are native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. The cabbage palmetto (&quot;Sabal palmetto&quot;), the state tree of both Florida and South Carolina, is widely cultivated along the south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coast of the United States, and needs hot and humid summers to grow. The species is considered hardy to USDA Hardiness Zone 8, and may survive short periods of temperatures as low as . Large and older specimens can be found from southeastern Virginia south to Florida and west to Texas. There are a few documented smaller specimens of cabbage palm growing in zone 7b in southern Maryland, Delaware, and coastal Connecticut in the city of Bridgeport. The Mexican palmetto (&quot;Sabal mexicana&quot;) is a close relative of the cabbage palmetto that is native to southern Texas and northern Mexico. Dwarf palmetto (&quot;Sabal minor&quot;) is considered hardy to USDA zone 6b, like the needle palm. It can tolerate short periods of temperatures as low as . Endemic to the swamps and lowlands of the south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coast of the United States, it can stand long periods of heat and drought. &quot;Sabal minor&quot; is successfully cultivated across the entire southern United States below 35 latitude, and up the East Coast to 41 latitude and up the West Coast to 45 latitude.

*Caranday palm (&quot;Trithrinax campestris&quot;) – The South American arecaceae palm is native of sabanas in Uruguay and northeastern Argentina. It is a rustic palm that grows in arid, well drained, rocky soils. Its distinctive features are its compact shape, short green to grayish foliage, and trunk fully hidden by dry dead branches (coat) remaining from several previous seasons. It is very resistant to drought, and -9 °C/-15 °C temperatures when not in growing season, although it tends to shed its leaves in these conditions. It is one of the most cold-hardy palms in the world, because it also grows in the mountains of Sierras de Córdoba.

*&quot;Washingtonia&quot; palms (&quot;Washingtonia filifera, W. robusta&quot;) – These palms are native to southern California and northwest Mexico, growing as high as in their native habitat. &quot;W. filifera&quot; is hardy to ; it prefers a dry Mediterranean climate, though it still grows in areas with humid subtropical climates like Brisbane, Sydney, Houston, and New Orleans. It is sometimes grown in containers, or planted as short-term specimens in areas where it is not quite hardy. &quot;W. robusta&quot; is somewhat less hardy, native to the Baja California Peninsula of northern Mexico It has a more robust trunk and stiffer leaves than &quot;W. filifera&quot;, and is hardy to .

*&quot;Livistona australis&quot; – It is native to southeastern Australia.
*&quot;Rhapis excelsa&quot; – It is native to China and it is hardy to about .
*Mexican blue palm (&quot;Brahea armata&quot;) – It is native to Baja California in Mexico and hardy to about .

==Pinnate-leaved palms==
Few palms with pinnate leaves tolerate much frost. They belong to several tribes of the Arecaceae, with the species listed here belonging to Tribe Areceae (&quot;Chamaedorea&quot;), Tribe Cocoseae (&quot;Butia, Jubaea&quot;) and Tribe Phoeniceae (&quot;Phoenix&quot;).

*Chilean wine palm (&quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;) – A contender for the hardiest pinnate-leaved palm, it is hardy to about and has been cultivated successfully as far north as Seattle, Vancouver and London. This palm does not perform well in hot, humid tropical climates.
*Butia palm or jelly palm, pindo palm (&quot;Butia odorata)&quot; – Along with &quot;Jubaea&quot;, possibly the hardiest known pinnate-leaved palm. &quot;B. odorata&quot; is a palm native to Brazil and Uruguay. This palm grows up to , exceptionally , in a slow but steady manner. It is easily identifiable with beautiful pinnate leaves that arch outwards from a thick stout trunk. &quot;B. odorata&quot; is notable as one of the hardiest feather palms, tolerating temperatures down to about ; it is widely cultivated in warm temperate regions. It is commonly grown on the East Coast of the United States as far north as Virginia Beach, Virginia and Portland and Seattle on the West coast. It thrives in humid subtropical climates. This tree is commonly known as the &quot;jelly palm&quot; because of the sticky, edible, date-like fruit it produces, which is used in many South American countries to make jelly.
*&quot;Butia eriospatha&quot; – Woolly helly palm – Though it may be more cold tolerant, in North America it is not found in cultivation as much as &quot;B. ordorata&quot;. This may be due to being native to a remote mountainous region of southern Brazil, at altitudes of , where the weather is more similar to the Pacific Northwest, with wet winters and cool summer days.
*&quot;Chamaedorea microspadix&quot; and &quot;Chamaedorea radicalis&quot; – the hardiest known species in the genus &quot;Chamaedorea&quot;. Both species come from Mexico and are considered stem hardy to about , although they will lose their leaves at temperatures below about .

*Canary Island date palm (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;) – This species is hardy to about , and is grown as far north as the south of England (50° N), producing viable seed (in Southsea, Hampshire, England). In North America mature specimens can be found as far north as Gold Beach, Oregon (42.5° N) on the West Coast, and Wilmington, North Carolina (35.2° N) on the East Coast. This palm is one of the most commonly grown palms in the world, and is well adapted to low humidity and little watering; it is used as an ornamental in both Mediterranean climates and desert climates. In more humid climates, these trees will often be seen with sword ferns sprouting just beneath the crown.
*Cretan date palm (&quot;Phoenix theophrasti&quot;) – Another species of &quot;Phoenix&quot; which shows similar frost tolerance, or it may be even hardier. Native to Crete in Greece and southwest Turkey, but has not been adequately tested for hardiness. 
*Date palm (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;) – This relative of the Canary Island date palm, and producer of the edible date fruit, is also hardy to about , but does not tolerate very wet areas. This palm is one of the staple plants of the Middle East for its versatility and edible fruit.
*&quot;Ceroxylon quindiuense&quot; – It is native to the Colombian Andes, where it is found at above sea level. At this altitude it tolerates occasional frosts for short periods of time. 
*&quot;Ceroxylon alpinum&quot; – Native to the Andes.
*&quot;Archontophoenix cunninghamiana&quot; – Native to Australia.
*&quot;Beccariophoenix alfredii&quot; – Native to Madagascar, slightly frost hardy. Resembles a coconut palm.
*&quot;Howea forsteriana&quot; – Native to Lord Howe Island in Australia.
*&quot;Rhopalostylis sapida&quot; – Native to New Zealand. It is the southernmost palm in the world, found as far south as 44°S.
*&quot;Caryota&quot; – Generally considered tolerant to occasional frosts.
*&quot;Dypsis decipiens&quot; – Native to Madagascar.
*&quot;Calamus caryotoides&quot; – Native to Queensland, Australia.
*&quot;Calamus erectus&quot; – Native to southern Asia.

==Plants referred to as palms==
Some plants used in subtropical landscaping in temperate climates like much of Europe, northern China/Japan, Korea, the northern USA, New Zealand, etc. that are commonly referred to as &quot;palms&quot;, but are not palms, i.e. not members of the Arecaceae family, include: &quot;Aloidendron barberae&quot;, &quot;Beaucarnea recurvata&quot;, &quot;Berberis eurybracteata&quot;, &quot;Cordyline australis&quot;, &quot;Cordyline indivisa&quot;, &quot;Cycas revoluta&quot;, &quot;Dasylirion&quot;, &quot;Cyathea australis&quot;, &quot;Cyathea capensis&quot;, &quot;Cyathea cooperi&quot;, &quot;Cyathea dealbata&quot;, &quot;Cyathea medullaris&quot;, &quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot;, &quot;Dicksonia squarrosa&quot;, &quot;Dioon angustifolium&quot;, &quot;Dioon edule&quot;, &quot;Encephalartos&quot;, &quot;Macrozamia communis&quot;, &quot;Macrozamia johnsonii&quot;, &quot;Macrozamia riedlei&quot;, &quot;Mahonia oiwakensis&quot;, &quot;Musa basjoo&quot;, &quot;Musa sikkimensis&quot;, &quot;Pseudopanax ferox&quot;, &quot;Rhus typhina&quot;, &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;, &quot;Yucca aloifolia&quot;, &quot;Yucca gigantea&quot;, &quot;Yucca rostrata&quot; and &quot;Zamia integrifolia&quot;.

==Hardiness==
In general, hardy palms can only tolerate &quot;brief&quot; periods with temperatures in the range . As such, this generally limits hardy palm cultivation and long term specimens to hardiness zone 7a or higher. Some hardy palms can be cultivated in areas with low temperatures slightly below this range when given wind sheltering (planted on the south side of a building). In the US, hardy palm cultivation is generally attempted from USDA zones 6b/7a southward.

In very cold winter areas below zone 6b, cold hardy palms have been cultivated by partially (or completely) covering plants with mini-green house coverings and wraps. Some garden enthusiasts in severe cold winter areas have gone as far as heating the interiors of these winter enclosures. As such, there are occasional reports of hardy palms be cultivated in areas with severe winters with low temperatures below .

<text>Monoral was a Japanese alternative rock band signed to Sony Music Japan. The band consisted of Anis Shimada (lead vocals and guitar) and Ali Morizumi (bass, guitar and keyboards).

==Members==
Anis, the band&#x27;s lead singer, born on February 23, 1975, is a British musician who speaks Japanese, English, French, and Arabic. Born in London, England to a Japanese father and a Moroccan-French mother, and raised in France, Anis was first discovered by Tetsuya Komuro, with whom he released a debut single in 1994 under the name of Aniss. He used to be a fashion model, as well as a MTV show host. He also used to support some famous musicians performing on TV as a guitarist. He is often involved with the creation of TV commercial songs, singing backup for other famous musicians, writing English lyrics and helping other artists as an English supervisor.

Ali, born in 1973, is a Japanese-American bassist and guitarist. Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan to an Iranian-American father and a Native Okinawan mother, he can speak both Japanese and English fluently. He was a VJ on MTV Japan, where he eventually met Anis. Ali is also a professional radio DJ and hosts a show on InterFM as well.

==History==
Their debut was in July 2001. Only two days after the release of their first mini album &quot;in stereo&quot;, they performed at the Fuji Rock Festival 2001. The band&#x27;s second minor debut album &quot;ammonite&quot;, which rose as high as No. 3 on the Tower Records Indie Charts in Japan, remained in the Top 50 for seven months. In 2005 they released their first major debut with the single &quot;Visions In My Head&quot;, under the label Haunted Records (a subsidiary of Sony Music Japan), which was created by the Japanese rock musician, HYDE, lead vocalist of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. They are now signed on HYDE&#x27;s label VAMPROSE.

The songs &quot;Pocketful of joy&quot; and &quot;Visions in my Head&quot; were used for a TV commercial for IXY digital camera by Canon. In 2006, the band performed &quot;Kiri&quot;, which became the opening theme to the anime series &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot;. The song was also released via the iTunes Store on May 25, 2006. Monoral also released their second major album, &quot;Turbulence&quot;, on July 4, 2007 and &quot;Via&quot;, on October 29, 2008. After the release of &quot;Via&quot;, they toured in Latin America, Europe and China.

==Collaborations==
Monoral&#x27;s support members are the guitarists Akira Yasue and Hirama Mikio (former member of Tokyo Incidents) and Daigo Kakijima on drums. Former support guitarist Eric Zay played for rock group FAKE?, another former guitarist Tomoya Tsusui has his own band called Tobyas.

<text>Water World (also known as, Hyland Hills Water World or Water World Colorado) is a water park that is part of the Hyland Hills Park and Recreation District and located in Federal Heights, Colorado, roughly north of downtown Denver, Colorado. The park first opened in August 1979 with the first two waterslides in the state of Colorado, the Bonzai Pipeline. Water World is generally open from Memorial Day through Labor Day, but may be closed some school days.

The park occupies , making it one of America&#x27;s largest water theme parks. In 2021, Amusement Today awarded Water World as the 5th best water park in the industry on their Golden Ticket Awards. , the park has 50 attractions including a multitude of water slides, a lazy river, inflatable tube rides, multi-guest inflatable raft rides, two wave pools, and a gondola, which offers access to and from the top of the park.

==Water attractions==
The park has several unique water attractions. One of the most notable is Screamin&#x27; Mimi, a ride where guests ride board-type vehicles down a roller coaster like track, reaching speeds of before landing in a pool and bouncing across the water. Other notable attractions include Glacier Run, an 8-lane head first mat slide with several steep drops; The Revolution, a 4-person cloverleaf tube ride that leads down into a tube bowl; Storm, a 4-person tube dark slide; and Sunset Racer, a racing slide that features eight side by side lanes and a timed open air finish.

Water World&#x27;s most famous attraction is Voyage to the Center of the Earth, in which riders ride in small circular multi-passenger inflatable rafts and travel through an artificial cavern. It is themed to a newly discovered cave that reportedly has creatures from the prehistoric era still inhabiting it. It includes steep downward spirals, sudden drop offs, and various dinosaurs, including an animatronic &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; encounter at the end of the ride. The ride is unusual for a water park attraction in its thematic emphasis, and in that it can take in excess of 5 minutes to complete, making it one of the longest rides at any water park. Since then, the ride has had two cosmetic upgrades, the most recent in the 2011 season. The Ride has a throughput capacity of over 1,000 guests per hour.

Water World has three wave pools: Turtle Bay, a very small wave pool for toddlers, Cowabunga Beach, a small wave pool, and Thunder Bay, a large pool which holds of water. Thunder Bay features a large Pepsi advertisement on the pool floor. Thunder Bay also sports a new engine that generates multiple wave types. The only wave cycle available for guests simulates medium ocean waves creating crashing waves and strong currents in certain areas of the pool. Thunder Bay has a maximum depth of , Cowabunga Beach has a maximum depth of about , and Turtle Bay has a maximum depth of . Both have multiple points of emergency shut-offs used to immediately cut engine power from the wave rooms for added guest safety.

In 1993, Water World installed The Fun House Express (now Alpine Springs Express) gondola connecting the lower and upper parts of the park. The fixed grip gondola, manufactured by Yan, was relocated to Water World from Circus Circus in Las Vegas, where it was lightly used. For most of its tenure at Water World, the gondola has circus theming at the bottom nodding to the origin of the lift. Some of the gondola towers are integrated into a The Peaks Speed Slides water slide platform. In 2021, Water World repainted and rethemed the bottom terminal.

In 2012, Water World announced the Mile High Flyer, a hydro-magnetic water coaster which launches riders up and down five unique hills taking only 45 seconds to complete.

In 2017, Water World changed the former Captain Jack&#x27;s wave pool into a smaller wave pool - Cowabunga Beach. This made room for Turtle Bay Kids Wave Pool directly next to Cowabunga Beach. Cowabunga Beach now acts as a Boogieboarding attraction during most hours through the day, but is open to as a play pool typically between 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM.

The newest area of the park is the Big Top, located adjacent to TurboRacer. Big Top is family oriented and features attractions for younger children as well as thrill seekers. In 2021, Water World renovated the Big Top area to a re-imagined and Colorado-themed Alpine Springs area. The area features Colorado landmarks throughout the entire area and has two new attractions, Roaring Forks, a 2-lane water coaster, and Centennial Basin, a tube bowl.

The park was included on a 2008 Travel Channel list of the top 10 water parks in the United States. USA Today readers named Water World one of the top 10 water parks in America in August 2013.

In 2021, Water World received a Golden Ticket Award for being one of the best water parks in the industry. The awards are handed out based on surveys given to experienced and well-traveled amusement and water park enthusiasts from around the world.

== Former Attractions==
* Space Bowls - Two body bowls that were removed to make way for Roaring Forks

== Pop culture reference ==

Water World was an inspiration for the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Pee&quot;, which features a water park named Pi Pi&#x27;s Splashtown. Many of the water parks rides appeared in the episode under slightly different names, including its most notable attraction Voyage to the Center of the Earth (retitled &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;).

The park was also featured in the 2006 film &quot;The Surfer King&quot;.

== Technology ==
Water World offers visitors a cashless payment option via RFID wristbands that can be preloaded with money at any POS terminal in the park. Season Passes (Splash Passes) can be upgraded to include a preloaded RFID cashless payment option. Water World also offers lockers that can be accessed via RFID wristbands. The wristbands are dispensed via a self-service kiosk located in Water World&#x27;s locker rental area. Unlike traditional single use lockers, the RFID wristbands allow users to access the locker multiple times throughout the day.

==2009 accident==

In 2009, a lifeguard pulled a 48-year-old man from Captain Jack&#x27;s Wave Pool (now Cowabunga Beach). Paramedics were unable to revive him. He was transported to the hospital and pronounced dead, with preliminary reports identifying drowning as the cause of death. This marked the first fatality in the park&#x27;s history.

<doc id="1160389" wikidata="Q5506300" url="?curid=1160389" title="Frozen Peas">
<text>Frozen Peas is the colloquial term for a blooper audio clip in which American actor and filmmaker Orson Welles performs narration for a series of British television advertisements for Findus. The clip is also known informally as In July, or Yes, Always, based on several of Welles&#x27;s complaints during the recording.

==Background==
The British Film Institute (BFI) database lists the titles &quot;Findus: Lincolnshire (Peas)&quot;, &quot;Findus: Sweden&quot; and &quot;Findus: Far West&quot;, all dated 1970, and attributed to the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency.

Jonathan Lynn, who acted in Welles&#x27;s film of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; made between 1969 and 1970, recalled being told about the recording session by Welles:
:::One night [Welles] told us about his voice over for Findus frozen peas. “An ad agency called and asked me to do a voice over. I said I would. Then they said would I please come in and audition.&quot; &#x27;Audition?&#x27; &quot;I said. &#x27;Surely to God there’s someone in your little agency who knows what my voice sounds like?&#x27; Well, they said they knew my voice but it was for the client. So I went in. I wanted the money, I was trying to finish &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;. I auditioned and they offered me the part! Well, they asked me to go to some little basement studio in Wardour Street to record it. I demanded payment in advance. After I&#x27;d gotten the cheque I told them &#x27;I can’t come to Wardour Street next week, I have to be in Paris.&#x27; I told them to bring their little tape-recorder and meet me at the Georges Cinq Hotel next Wednesday at eleven am. So they flew over to Paris, came to the hotel at eleven – and were told that I had checked out the day before.&quot; He chortled happily. &quot;I left them a message telling them to call me at the Gritti Palace in Venice. They did, and I told them to meet me there on Friday. When they got there I was gone – they found a message telling them to come to Vienna.&quot; Now he was laughing uproariously. &quot;I made them chase me all around Europe with their shitty little tape recorder for ten days. They were sorry they made me audition.&quot;

It is therefore possible that Welles recorded the session in Vienna, during the making of the &quot;Vienna&quot; segment of his unfinished &quot;Orson&#x27;s Bag&quot; TV special. 

Lynn’s second-hand story may be a recollection from the initial recording session with perhaps the same client (the director was heard to refer to a previous successful session). Also, the outtakes give many clues that they took place in a professional recording studio and not a hotel using a portable recorder. This also would better explain the client-mandated audition. 

The BFI database also lists four more 1970 Findus advertisements with place names: &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Highlands&quot;, &quot;Normandy and &quot;Shetland&quot;. These may be part of the same series, and possibly also voiced by Welles.

===Bootleg circulation===
The original recording was made in 1970. The outtake/blooper reel was presumably spliced to circulate as a bootleg recording, and nothing is known about who made it or their connection to Findus or J. Walter Thompson. The earliest record of the bootleg dates to 1979, when advertiser Peter Shillingford shared a copy with Welles, who enjoyed it.

It is not known whether a complete recording of the session exists (since, for example, the &quot;multiple takes&quot; Welles alludes to are not contained on the circulated recording, and the recording transitions between different commercials). It is also not known whether film copies of the final advertisements exist in the BFI National Archive.

==Summary==
The recording begins with Welles reading the introduction to a script for a commercial for frozen peas.

&quot;We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire, where Mrs. Buckley lives; every July, peas grow there...&quot;

Welles breaks from the script, expressing his dissatisfaction about the timing of the piece, as well as remarking that &quot;it&#x27;s so nice that you see a snow-covered field and say, &quot;Every &quot;July&quot;, peas grow there...we&#x27;re talking about &#x27;em growing and she&#x27;s picked &#x27;em.&quot;

A director requests that he emphasize the word &#x27;in&#x27; in the phrase &quot;in July;&quot; Welles claims this is impossible to do in a sensible fashion, claiming that the director isn&#x27;t thinking.

Why? That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Sorry. There&#x27;s no known way of saying an English sentence in which you begin a sentence with &#x27;in&#x27; and emphasize it. Get me a jury and show me how you can say &quot;&quot;in&quot; July&quot;, and I&#x27;ll go down on you. That&#x27;s just idiotic, if you&#x27;ll forgive me my saying so. That&#x27;s just stupid, &quot;&quot;in&quot; July&quot;; I&#x27;d love to know how you emphasize &#x27;in&#x27; in &quot;In July&quot;...impossible! Meaningless! 

A director apologizes because the script actually said &quot;Every July&quot; rather than &quot;in July&quot;, but Welles continues to complain that it was the other director who made the suggestion, and quips, &quot;Too much directing around here.&quot;

From here, the recording transitions to a different commercial for fish fingers, apparently at either the same recording session, or for the same director:

&quot;We know a certain fjord in Norway, near where the cod gather in great shoals. There, Jan St...&quot;

Welles struggles with the pronunciation of the fisherman&#x27;s name, cursing under his breath. The director requests a different pacing, but Welles refuses.

You don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m up against: because it&#x27;s full of, of, of things that are only correct because they&#x27;re grammatical but they&#x27;re tough on the ear, you see; this is a very wearying one, it&#x27;s unpleasant to read. Unrewarding.

Welles attempts to finish the script but gets tangled around the words &quot;crumb-crisp coating.&quot; The directors permit him to remove the word &quot;crumb.&quot;

The recording moves on to yet another advertisement, for hamburgers, but not before Welles slips in a complaint.

Here, under protest, is &quot;beef burgers.&quot; &quot;We know a little place in the American far west, where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes...&quot; This is a lot of shit, you know that?

The directors ask for one more take, as they don&#x27;t like the way he emphasizes &quot;prairie-fed&quot; over beef.

But you can&#x27;t emphasize &#x27;beef&#x27;; that&#x27;s like his wanting me to emphasize &#x27;in&#x27; before &#x27;July&#x27;! Come on, fellas, you&#x27;re losing your heads! I wouldn&#x27;t direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare, the way you do this! It&#x27;s impossible!

The directors try to calm him down, but Welles insists he&#x27;s giving it the right reading, to which a director responds, &quot;For the moment.&quot; Welles continues to gripe about the number of takes he&#x27;s made for these commercials, which he claims is twenty more than any other he&#x27;s made.

You&#x27;re such pests...now, what is it you want? In your depths of your ignorance, what is it you want? Well, whatever it is you want, I can&#x27;t deliver because I just don&#x27;t see it.

When the engineer attempts to give Welles some pointers, the actor reveals his frustration of being a performer, a &quot;hired hand&quot; on the commercial being given conflicting advice from different people in the booth.

I take direction from one person...under protest, but from two I don&#x27;t sit still.

The actual director continues to try to calm Welles down, but he storms out of the recording booth.

This isn&#x27;t worth it, no money is worth it!
==Parodies==
The tape has been parodied many times, often when parodying Welles himself. In the animated series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, an episode featuring Pinky and the Brain titled &quot;Yes, Always&quot;, featured a near-verbatim restaging (with vulgarities replaced by innocuous substitutes, e.g., &quot;...and I&#x27;ll make cheese for you&quot; in place of &quot;...and I&#x27;ll go down on you&quot;), with Brain playing the part of Welles and Pinky as the director. Brain&#x27;s voice actor, Maurice LaMarche, well known for his Welles impressions, would sometimes parody the &quot;frozen peas&quot; tape before recording sessions as a warm up, and parts of these warmup lines were incorporated into the cartoon&#x27;s script.

Another version portrayed in &quot;The Critic&quot; features Welles, again voiced by LaMarche, whispering &quot;Rosebud&quot; à la &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; before the shot pans out to reveal Welles at a table, with a plate of Rosebud Frozen Peas he is advertising. After reading his lines, describing the peas as &quot;full of country goodness and green pea-ness,&quot; he becomes disgusted and walks off, taking a handful of peas with him and eating them alongside a French fry stuck in his beard. In another episode, Welles, upset over having to read a living will, begins endorsing for &quot;Mrs. Pell&#x27;s Fish Sticks&quot; instead, eating them and declaring that &quot;they&#x27;re even better raw&quot;. He even appears later as a ghostly apparition to Margo Sherman to continue promoting and eating the fish sticks, declaring that &quot;they&#x27;re even better when you&#x27;re dead&quot;.

Another parody of the tape appeared in a skit on the Canadian sketch comedy show &quot;SCTV&quot;, where Welles, played by John Candy, is hired by Liberace, played by Dave Thomas, for a Christmas storytelling. Welles is frequently distracted by the TV crew and finally, he gets up and walks off (taking an entire roast turkey with him). Amongst Welles&#x27;s complaints in this scene are three direct quotes from the &quot;Frozen Peas&quot; recording: &quot;You don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m up against,&quot; &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare,&quot; and &quot;No money is worth this!&quot;

Yet another animated example, once more portrayed by LaMarche comes from the 2010 &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot; for which he won an Emmy Award. Welles (as a head in a jar) agrees to recreate his famous &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast for Lrrr, the Planet Express crew and a cheese log even when complaining on-air about obvious plot holes in the script.

The tape was referenced in the &quot;Bishop&quot; skit from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;, where it is mentioned that &quot;Bath and Wells&quot; is busy &quot;doing frozen peas for Nigel.&quot;

Will Ferrell&#x27;s bookend segments in the miniseries &quot;The Spoils of Babylon&quot;, as Eric Jonrosh (a Welles lookalike), feature Jonrosh breaking from the script frequently to complain of inane language and berate the unseen crew.

==Other media==
The experimental music group Negativland incorporated &quot;frozen peas&quot; in its entirety in the track &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot;, a collage also featuring sound effects and other archival recordings of commercials in production phase. The track appears on their 1998 EP &quot;Happy Heroes&quot;.

California punk band Swingin&#x27; Utters released an album in 2011 entitled Here, Under Protest and opens with a clip of Welles saying, &quot;Here, under protest, is beef burgers&quot;.

<doc id="1160403" wikidata="Q6598560" url="?curid=1160403" title="List of sultans of Sokoto">
<text>The sultan of Sokoto is the hereditary leader of the Sokoto Caliphate, a Sunni Muslim community in West Africa. The position may also be referred to as the &#x27;Sokoto Caliph&#x27; or the &quot;Commander of the Faithful&quot; (&quot;Amir-ul-Momineen&quot; in Arabic or &quot;Lamido Julbe&quot; in Fulani). The current holder of this title, since 2006, is Sa&#x27;adu Abubakar. 

The sultan of Sokoto is the leader of the Qadiriyya Sufi order, historically the most important Muslim position in Nigeria and senior to the Emir of Kano, the leader of the Tijaniyya Sufi order. The post has become increasingly ceremonial since British rule defeated the caliphate and replaced it with the Sokoto Sultanate Council in 1903, but the sultan – considered a spiritual leader in the Muslim community in Nigeria – can still carry much weight with Fulani and Hausa people from northern Nigeria.Usman dan Fodio, the founder of the dynasty of Sokoto State and of the Fulani Empire (consisting of the Fulbe Jihad states of which Sokoto was suzerain), never used the high style of Sultan but was simply titled &quot;Amir al-Mu´minin&quot; . The first to assume the title of Sultan was Fodio&#x27;s son Muhammed Bello, who ruled from 1817 to 1837. Since the creation of the title, there have been nineteen Sultans of Sokoto, all men from the Torodbe scholar caste who are descended from Usman dan Fodio. Siddiq Abubakar III was the longest serving Sultan, holding the position for 50 years from 1938 to 1988. The shortest reign was that of Muhammadu Attahiru I, who held the position for five months in 1902–03. The 17th sultan, Ibrahim Dasuki, was forcefully deposed in 1996 by the Sani Abacha military government of Nigeria.

Prior to the beginning of the Fulani Jihad of 1804, the ethnic category Fulani was not important for the Torodbe and their literature reveals the ambivalence they had defining Torodbe-Fulani relationships. They adopted the language of the Fulani and much ethos while maintaining a separate, non-ethnic identity. The Torodbe clan at first recruited members from all levels of Sūdānī society, particularly the poorer people.

==List of sultans==

As mentioned above, the sultans were also styled &quot;Amir al-Mu´minin&quot; and &quot;Sarkin Musulmi&quot; (&quot;King of the Muslims&quot;), basically the autochthonous form of the former, which is the Arabic style of caliphs and other independent sovereign Muslim rulers that claim legitimacy from a community of Muslims); Mai, occurring in various sultans&#x27; surnames, is another autochthonous title. The table below shows the historical list of the sultan of Sokoto, beginning from 1817.

<doc id="1160406" wikidata="Q3443771" url="?curid=1160406" title="Ontario Highway 2">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway2, commonly referred to as Highway2, is the lowest-numbered provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, and was originally part of a series of identically numbered highways which started in Windsor, stretched through Quebec and New Brunswick, and ended in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Prior to the 1990s, Highway2 travelled through many of the major cities in Southern Ontario, including Windsor, Chatham, London, Brantford, Hamilton, Burlington, Mississauga, Toronto, Oshawa, Belleville, Kingston and Cornwall, and many other smaller towns and communities.

Once the primary east–west route across the southern portion of Ontario, most of Highway2 was bypassed by Highway 401, which was completed in 1968. The August 1997 completion of Highway 403 bypassed one final section through Brantford. Virtually all of the length of Highway2 was deemed a local route and removed from the provincial highway system by January1, 1998, with the exception of a section east of Gananoque. The entire route remains driveable, but as &quot;County Road2&quot; or &quot;County Highway2&quot; in most regions.
Portions of what became Highway2 served as early settlement trails, post roads and stagecoach routes. While the arrival of the railroad in the mid-19th century diminished the importance of the route, the advent of the bicycle and later the automobile renewed interest in roadbuilding. A segment of Highway2 between Pickering and Port Hope was the first section of roadway assumed by the newly-formed Department of Public Highways (DPHO) on August21, 1917. By the end of 1920, the department had taken over roads connecting Windsor with the Quebec boundary at Rivière-Beaudette, which it would number as Provincial Highway2 in the summer of 1925. In 1930, the DPHO was renamed the Department of Highways (DHO), and provincial highways became King&#x27;s Highways. By this time, it was one of the dominant transportation arteries across southern Ontario and was long.

The section of Highway2 between Hamilton and Toronto along Lakeshore Road became the first paved intercity road in Ontario in 1914. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the DHO began reconstructing several portions of the highway into the new German-inspired &quot;dual highway&quot;, including east from Scarborough along Kingston Road. This would be the progenitor to Highway401, which was built in a patchwork fashion across Southern Ontario throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, often as bypass of and parallel to Highway2 (except between Woodstock and Toronto). Conversely, the importance of Highway2 for long-distance travel was all but eliminated, and coupled with the increasing suburbanization of the Greater Toronto Area, it became simply a series of urban arterials street between Hamilton and Oshawa.

Having been replaced in importance by the parallel freeways of Highway401, the Queen Elizabeth Way, and finally Highway403, the province gradually transferred sections of the route back to the municipal, county and regional governments that it passed through, a process known as &quot;downloading&quot;. In 1997 and 1998, the province downloaded of Highway2 and rescinded dozens of Connecting Link agreements, reducing the route to its current length.

== Route description ==
Since 1998, Highway2 has remained in the provincial highway system solely as a connection between westbound Thousand Islands Parkway and eastbound Highway401. Highway2 begins at the eastern town limits of Gananoque, and travels east a short distance before gently curving northward. It meets an interchange with the Thousand Islands Parkway—once referred to as Highway2S,
prior to becoming a temporary part of Highway401 in 1952—and ends at the westbound Highway401 offramp (Exit648). The roadway continues as Leeds and Grenville County Road 2 both east and west of the remaining highway segment.

=== Before 1997 ===
Before being mostly-decommissioned as a provincial highway in the mid-1990s, Highway2 was a continuous route from Highway 3 in Windsor to the Quebec border.
Prior to the arrival of Highway401 in the 1950s and early 1960s, Highway2 was the primary east–west route across the southern portion of Ontario.
At one time it connected with Quebec Route 2, which was renumbered in 1966 as multiple highways,
and onwards to New Brunswick Route 2 and Nova Scotia Trunk 2 to end in Halifax. New Brunswick reassigned Route2 to a new freeway running between Fredericton and Moncton in 2007,
while Nova Scotia kept its portion of Highway2 intact, numbering its bypass as Highway 102 and Highway 104.

In 1972, the Ontario and Quebec governments designated Highway/Route2 from Windsor to Rivière-du-Loup as the Heritage Highway (Route des Pionniers), a tourist route which continued eastward to the Gaspé Peninsula on what is now Quebec Route 132.
This tourist route included various side trips, such as highways to Ottawa and Niagara Falls.
While this signage is maintained in some counties, others have promoted local tours, including the Apple Route between Trenton and Brighton,
the Arts Route in Hastings County,
and the Chemin du Roy (The King&#x27;s Way, now Route 138) between Montreal and Quebec City.

==== Windsor–Mississauga ====
Within Ontario and prior to 1997, Highway2 began in Windsor at the interchange between the E. C. Row Expressway and Highway3 (Huron Church Road), where it also met the northern terminus of Highway 18. It followed the expressway east through Windsor, with the divided highway transitioning to an urban arterial road near Lesperance Road.
It travelled nearby the south shoreline of Lake St. Clair as it bisected Emeryville and Belle River before curving south briefly. It then turned east and travelled through a rural setting to Tilbury, where it met Highway401 at two interchanges (Exit56 and 63). Crossing from Essex County to Kent County, the highway curved northeast and passed through Chatham—where it intersected Highway 40—Louisville and Thamesville—where it intersected Highway 21—before entering Middlesex County near Bothwell—where it met Highway 79.

Between Chatham and Delaware, Highway2 travelled roughly parallel to and north of the Thames River. It passed through the communities of Wardsville, Strathburn—intersecting Highway 76 and Highway 80—and Melbourne before encountering an interchange with Highway 402 and crossing the Thames River. Within Delaware, the highway intersected Highway 81 and turned east. At Lambeth it met Highway 4 and the two highways travelled concurrent northeast into London. In downtown London, Highway2 and Highway4 parted at the intersection of York Street and Richmond Street, with Highway2 continuing east along the former. It intersected the northern end of Highway100, now known as the Veterans Memorial Parkway. While the route was south of the Thames River between Delaware and London, it continued east along Dundas Street between the two branches of the river between London and Woodstock, intersecting Highway 19 between the two in the community of Thamesford.

At Woodstock, Highway2 intersected Highway 59 and met Highway401 at an interchange near the split with Highway403. It then continued east, becoming parallel with the latter towards Hamilton. It intersected with Highway 53 at Eastwood and passed through the communities of Creditville, Gobles and Falkland before entering Paris. Within Paris, the highway intersected Highway 24A and met the western terminus of Highway 5, with which it remained within through to Toronto. Highway2 branched southeast through Brantford, where it intersected Highway 24 and became concurrent with Highway53 before meeting the end of Highway403 at Cainsville; Highway 54 branched south from there.

Before 1997, Highway403 was discontinuous between Cainsville and Ancaster, intersecting and merging into Highway2 at both locations. The combined Highway2/53 travelled east through Alberton, before splitting at Duff&#x27;s Corners. Highway2 split to the northeast, and Highway403 resumed at what is now Exit58. Highway2 then travelled through Ancaster, became concurrent with Highway 8 and entered into Hamilton. Following a series of streets, the routes split, and Highway2 travelled north, now concurrent with Highway 6. The two routes split northeast of Burlington Bay, with Highway2 turning northeast into Burlington, encountering an interchange with the Queen Elizabeth Way at North Shore Boulevard. North Shore becomes Lakeshore Road, which the highway followed through Oakville and Mississauga along the shore of Lake Ontario towards Toronto.

==== Toronto–Quebec ====
At the Etobicoke Creek, Highway2 entered Etobicoke, one of the six municipalities in Metropolitan Toronto that amalgamated to form the present City of Toronto in 1998. At that point Lakeshore Road also transitioned to Lake Shore Boulevard. It intersected the southern end of Highway 27 and travelled through the community of New Toronto, where numerous motels flourished during the golden age of the automobile which have since given way to condominium development. Approaching the west bank of the Humber River which was the eastern terminus of the Queen Elizabeth Way until 1998, the Highway2 route merged onto the Gardiner Expressway via an on-ramp from Lake Shore Boulevard. Highway2 proceeded to follow the Gardiner around Humber Bay and then through Downtown Toronto on the Gardiner&#x27;s elevated section. Beyond the Don Valley Parkway interchange, the Gardiner descended to ground level and ended, so Highway2 rejoined Lakeshore Boulevard near Leslie Street. Highway2 continued east, splitting into two routes; one continuing along Lake Shore until it curved north as it transitioned into Woodbine Avenue and the second via Coxwell Avenue and a short stretch of Queen Street to then follow Kingston Road. The two routes then rejoined at Woodbine and Kingston, following the latter northeast into Scarborough.Prior to the construction of the Gardiner and Lakeshore Boulevard, the original alignment of Highway 2 through Downtown Toronto split into three separate routes to disperse traffic through the core. The northernmost route ran along Queen Street until Kingston Road. Another route split from Queen on both ends and ran along the entire length of King Street. The southernmost route consisted of streets which are now partially or wholly absorbed into Lake Shore: Fleet, Cherry, and Keating Streets; as well as short sections of Leslie Street and Eastern Avenue until meeting with the Queen Street route at Kingston Road. All three routes rejoined at and followed Kingston Road along the newest pre-1998 alignment., although after the construction of Lake Shore, the aforementioned later branches along Coxwell and Woodbine Avenues were created.

After crossing the Highland Creek valley, Highway2 and Kingston Road followed an off-ramp at the Highland Creek Overpass since the main road defaulted to Highway 2A, travelling parallel to and north of Highway 2A (the latter route being a short freeway connecting directly Highway401). Highway2 continued along Kingston Road as it passed under Highway401 and then crossed the Rouge River into Pickering and Durham Region, initially alongside Highway401 before departing farther north. It bisected Pickering Village and passed through Ajax. Entering Whitby—where it intersected Highway 12 at Brock Street—Kingston Road became Dundas Street, while in Oshawa it became King Street. Highway2 then split into a one-way pairing within the latter, with westbound traffic following the adjacent Bond Street. It continued eastward through Courtice, Bowmanville and Newcastle as it drifted closer to Highway401 and Lake Ontario; an interchange with Highway 35/115 was encountered immediately west of Newcastle.
After passing through Newtonville, Highway2 entered Northumberland County, passing through the communities of Morrish and Welcome before turning southeast and crossing Highway401 into Port Hope and intersecting the southern end of Highway 28. It continued near the shoreline of Lake Ontario through the town of Cobourg, where it intersected the southern end of Highway 45, as well as the communities of Grafton, Wicklow, Colborne and Salem. At the town of Brighton, where it intersected the southern end of Highway 30, the highway entered Hastings County and moved inland from Lake Ontario. In Trenton, the route crossed the Trent–Severn Waterway, intersected Highway 33, and began to travel along the northern shoreline of the Bay of Quinte.

Continuing northeast, Highway2 passed south of CFB Trenton and through the community of Bayside before travelling through the city of Belleville, where it intersected both Highway 62 and Highway 37. After passing through the communities of Shannonville and Marysville, it turned south and bisected the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory. Highway2 turned east at an intersection with Highway 49 and travelled through Deseronto, after which it entered Lennox and Addington County. At Napanee, the highway met the southern terminus of Highway 41 then travelled through the communities of Morven, Odessa and Westbrook before entering Kingston.

Within Kingston, Highway2 followed Princess Street and intersected Highway 38 and Highway33, crossed the Cataraqui River and Rideau Canal on the La Salle Causeway, then intersected the southern end of Highway 15 near CFB Kingston. For the remainder of its length, the highway followed close to or along the northern shoreline of the St. Lawrence River. Travelling northeast from Kingston, Highway2 passed through the communities of Barriefield, Ravensview and Pitts Ferry before reaching Gananoque and intersected the southern terminus of Highway 32. By 1997, the portion of Highway2 between the interchanges at Exit648 east of Gananoque and Exit687 west of Brockville along Highway401 was maintained by the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, serving the communities of Wilstead, Mallorytown and Butternut Bay. The highway intersected Highway 29 at Brockville, then passed through the communities of Maitland, Prescott and Johnstown, intersecting the southern end of Highway 16 at the latter. It passed through Cardinal, as well as the Lost Villages relocated towns of Iroquois, Morrisburg—where it intersected Highway 31—Ingleside and Long Sault before entering Cornwall. It met the southern terminus of Highway 138 and continued northeast through the communities of Glen Walter and Summerstown. At Lancaster—the final notable community along Highway2—the route met Highway 34, and shortly thereafter crossed into Quebec.

=== Current routes ===
Despite being decommissioned as a provincial highway in the 1990s, almost the entirety of the former highway remains driveable, and is now maintained by the various counties, regions, and cities through which it passes. The various sections have the following designations, from west to east:
== History ==
Highway 2 was the first roadway assumed under the maintenance of the Department of Public Highways (today&#x27;s Ministry of Transportation of Ontario). The section from the Rouge River to Smith&#x27;s Creek, now Port Hope, was inaugurated on August 21, 1917, as &quot;The Provincial Highway&quot;. On June 7, 1918, the designation was extended east approximately to the Quebec border.

=== Footpaths ===

The forerunners to Highway 2 are numerous paths constructed during the colonization of Ontario. While some portions may have existed as trails created by Indigenous peoples for hundreds of years, the first recorded construction along what would become Highway 2 was in late October 1793, when Captain Smith and 100 Queen&#x27;s Rangers returned from carving &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Road&quot; through the thick forests between Dundas and the present location of Paris. John Graves Simcoe was given the task of defending Upper Canada (present day Ontario) from the United States following the American Revolution and with opening the territory to settlement. After establishing a &quot;temporary&quot; capital at York (present day Toronto), Simcoe ordered an inland route constructed between Cootes Paradise at the tip of Lake Ontario and his proposed capital of London. By the spring of 1794, the road was extended as far as &quot;La Tranche&quot;, now the Thames River, in London. In 1795, the path was connected with York. Asa Danforth Jr., recently immigrated from the United States, was awarded the task, for which he would be compensated $90 per mile.
Beginning on June 5, 1799, the road was extended eastwards. Danforth was hired once more, and tasked with clearing a road east from York through the bush, with (preferably in the centre) cut to the ground. It was carved as far as Port Hope by December, and to the Trent River soon after. Danforth&#x27;s inspector and acting surveyor general William Chewett declared the road &quot;good&quot; for use in the dead of winter, but &quot;impassible&quot; during the wet summers, when the path turned to a bottomless mud pit. He went on to suggest that rather than setting aside land for government officials which would never be occupied, the land be divided into lots for settlers who could then be tasked with statute labour to maintain the path. Danforth agreed, but the province insisted otherwise and only four settlers took up residence along the road between Toronto and Port Hope;
like many other paths of the day, it became a quagmire.
Danforth&#x27;s road did not always follow the same path as today&#x27;s Kingston Road. Beginning near Victoria Park Avenue and Queen Street East, the road can be traced along Clonmore Drive, Danforth Road, Painted Post Drive, Military Trail and Colonel Danforth Trail. Other sections of the former roadway exist near Port Hope and Cobourg, as well as within Grafton. Otherwise the two roads more or less overlap until they reach the Trent River; beyond this point Danforth&#x27;s road is continued (1802) on a more southern route to reach the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (now Glenora). As the route straying through Scarborough avoided many of the settlers who had taken up residence near the lake, Danforth&#x27;s road was bypassed by 1814 by William Cornell and Levi Annis. The &quot;Cornell Road&quot; (as it was known for a short time) shortened the journey from Victoria Park to West Hill, but remained mostly impassible like Danforth&#x27;s route to the north. Finally succumbing to increasing pressures, the government raised funds to straighten the road and extend it through Belleville to Kingston. The work was completed by 1817 and the road renamed &quot;The Kingston Road&quot;.

Downriver from Kingston, roads built along the St. Lawrence for War of 1812 military use became a popular means to avoid rapids on the river by travelling overland.
===Stagecoach and mail road===
The creation of a post road extended year-round communication which had already existed on the Chemin du Roy from Quebec City-Montreal westward, with the first stagecoaches reaching York (Toronto) in January 1817. This link proved economically vital to enterprises such as the Bank of Montreal, established 1817 with branches in Quebec, Montreal, Kingston and Toronto. The original coaches left Montreal every Monday and Thursday, arriving in Kingston two days later; the full Montreal-York run took a week.

As with earlier routes (such as the Danforth Road), coaching inns prospered in every wayside village as the stagecoaches made frequent stops for water, food or fresh horses.

The original &quot;York Road&quot; (from Kingston) aka &quot;Kingston Road&quot; (from York) was initially little more than a muddy horse path. In 1829, a ferry crossing on the Cataraqui River in Kingston was replaced by a draw bridge. In the 1830s, efforts were made by various toll road operators to macadamise the trail as a gravel stagecoach road. On one section between Cobourg and Port Hope the Cobourg Star on October 11, 1848, expressed &quot;surprise and deep regret, that the Cobourg and Port Hope Road Company have placed a tollgate on their road, although only just gravelled&quot; adding a week later &quot;On Sunday night last, the Toll House and Gate on the Port Hope Road were burned to the ground. We regret to say that there is no doubt as to its having been done designedly as a very hard feeling has grown up against the Company, from their having exacted Toll before the road was properly packed. They might have known that no community would quietly submit to drive their teams and heavy loads through six inches of gravel and pay for the privilege. But we would not be understood to sanction the lawless proceeding which has taken place.&quot;

Despite these issues, this road would remain the principal means of winter travel until the Grand Trunk Railway connected Montreal and Toronto in 1856. As intercity traffic formerly carried by the various stagecoach operators migrated to the iron horse, stagecoach roads faded to primarily local importance, carrying regional traffic.

This changed as the 20th century and the invention of the motorcar quickly made evident a need for better roads in the young but growing Dominion. The macadamised Lake Shore Road between Toronto and Hamilton, in poor condition with ongoing erosion, was the first section to be upgraded with concrete. The Toronto–Hamilton Highway, proposed in 1914, was opened along the lakeshore in November 1917. The Cataraqui Bridge, a toll swing bridge, was replaced by the La Salle Causeway that same year.

In 1918, the province subsidised the county and municipal purchase of various former toll roads (Brockville-Prescott, Paris-Brantford, Cobourg-Port Hope and Cobourg-Baltimore) to be improved and incorporated into the provincial highway system. Later acquisitions included a road from Cobourg to Grafton. As the roads became publicly owned, toll gates were removed.

In 1925, the Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, both adjacent to 1854 Grand Trunk Railway bridges which were the first fixed mainland links to Montreal, brought Route 2 onto Montreal Island.

=== Provincial highway ===

Ontario has published an official highway map since at least 1923, an era when many provincial highways were still gravel or unimproved road. To accommodate the passenger cars of the Roaring Twenties, efforts to pave Ontario&#x27;s roads had begun in earnest. The 1926 Official Road Map of Ontario boasted the &quot;Highway from Windsor to the Quebec border, via London will all be paved at the end of the present year&quot; and &quot;a person will then be able to travel over 700 miles of pavement without a detour&quot;. Twenty-five years after the first provincial road improvement efforts, Ontario maps boastfully listed fifteen king&#x27;s highways (numbered 2-17, as 1 and 13 were never assigned) and a growing network of county roads. While thousands of miles of dirt and gravel road still remained throughout the system, the steel rails which crossed the region now had a credible rival in southern Ontario.

Beginning in 1935, Highway Minister Thomas McQuesten applied the concept of a second roadway to several projects along Highway 2: a stretch west of Brockville, a stretch from Woodstock eastward, and a section between Birchmount Road to east of Morningside Avenue in Scarborough Township. When widening in Scarborough reached the Highland Creek ravine in 1936, east of Morningside, the Department of Highways began construction on a second bridge over the large valley (the original having been constructed as a bypass of the former alignment through West Hill in 1919). From here the highway was constructed on a new alignment to Oshawa, avoiding construction on the congested Highway 2. As grading and bridge construction neared completion between Highland Creek and Ritson Road in September 1939, World War II broke out and gradually money was siphoned from highway construction to the war effort.
The wartime rationing of the 1940s soon gave way to the fifties neon era of growing prosperity, increased vehicle ownership and annual paid vacations. Service stations, diners, motels and tourist-related establishments were proliferating on long strips of highway such as Toronto&#x27;s Lakeshore Boulevard and Kingston Road to accommodate the growing number of travellers.

Increased traffic initially led to a construction boom, but soon the most congested sections were among the first candidates to be bypassed by freeway. By 1955, businesspeople along the north shore of Lake Erie were organising efforts to promote tourism on Highways 2 and 3, both of which stood to lose traffic upon the construction of Highway 401. In 1956, the 401 provided a continuous Toronto Bypass from Weston to Oshawa.

A portion of the highway in the area of Morrisburg was permanently submerged by the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958. The highway was rebuilt along a Canadian National Railway right-of-way in the area to bypass the flooded region. The town of Iroquois was also flooded, but was relocated 1.5 kilometres north rather than abandoned. This event led to the nickname of &quot;The Lost Villages&quot; for a number of communities in the area.

Countless roadside motels from Windsor to Montreal were bypassed in the 1960s, with the 401 freeway completed in 1968. Growing hotel chains built new facilities near the 401 offramps, saturating the market in some areas. By the 1980s, Toronto&#x27;s portion of the Kingston Road was in steep decline. Some motels were used to shelter homeless or refugee populations, others were simply demolished.
The section of Highway 2 between Woodstock and Ancaster (today a part of Hamilton) was not bypassed by 401 (which followed a more northerly corridor to serve Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph), but was ultimately bypassed by Highway 403. As the main street in many communities Highway 2 remained busy with stop-and-go local traffic, sustaining countless shopkeepers and restaurateurs but offering little comfort to independent tourist motels. Outside urban areas, numerous former service stations were converted to other uses, demolished or abandoned.

The last section from Ancaster to Brantford, was bypassed on August 15, 1997. On January 1, 1998, most of the former length of Highway 2 was &quot;downloaded&quot;, transferring the highway from provincial responsibility to local counties or municipalities. The route lost its King&#x27;s Highway designation in the process, along with much of its visibility on printed Ontario maps. Many Ontario highways which originally ended at Highway 2 (as the backbone of Ontario&#x27;s highway system) were truncated or simply decommissioned, most often becoming county roads.

One token provincially maintained section of Highway 2 remains east of Gananoque; this section remains provincially maintained because the Thousand Islands Parkway does not have a complete interchange with Highway 401, meaning that some drivers must use the Highway 2 interchange to transfer between the two roads.

<doc id="1160411" wikidata="Q1334654" url="?curid=1160411" title="Emanuel Cleaver">
<text>Emanuel Cleaver II (born October 26, 1944) is a United Methodist pastor and American politician who has represented in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2005. He was previously the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri from 1991–1999.

Cleaver represents a district that primarily consists of the inner ring of the Kansas City metropolitan area, including nearly all of Kansas City and some of its suburbs in Clay and Jackson counties, including North Kansas City, Gladstone, Independence, Lee&#x27;s Summit, and some of Blue Springs. He is a member of the Democratic Party, and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2011 to 2013.

In his 11th term in Congress , Cleaver previously served three terms on the Kansas City Council from 1979 to 1991, until he was elected mayor, serving two terms from 1991 to 1999.

== Early life, education, and career ==
Emanuel Cleaver II was born on October 26, 1944, in Waxahachie, Texas. He grew up in public housing in Wichita Falls, Texas. He graduated from Prairie View A&amp;M University, where he was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, in 1972. Cleaver then moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he founded a branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and received a Master of Divinity degree from St. Paul School of Theology.

Cleaver was the pastor at the St. James United Methodist Church in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1972 to 2009.

== Kansas City councilman and mayor ==
Cleaver served as a Kansas City councilman from 1979 to 1991 and as mayor of Kansas City from 1991 until 1999. He was Kansas City&#x27;s first African American mayor.

David Helling, an opinion columnist for the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot;, wrote of Cleaver&#x27;s tenure as mayor: &quot;Kansas City&#x27;s first African-American mayor defined the modern concept of the job: a professional staff, high visibility and a clear agenda. He was also a moral leader. His speech at a local rally after the Rodney King verdict averted a riot and was his finest moment. Yet Cleaver&#x27;s actual record as mayor is spotty. Tax and spending initiatives floundered at the polls, and City Hall scandal was common. The crime rate was far too high.&quot;

Cleaver is a cousin of exiled Kansas City Black Panther leader Pete O&#x27;Neal. In 1997, Cleaver unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a pardon for O&#x27;Neal from President Bill Clinton. Cleaver is also a cousin of the late Eldridge Cleaver, another prominent figure in the Black Panther Party.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
After the compromise Budget Control Act deal had been reached to resolve the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, Cleaver called the deal a &quot;sugar-coated Satan sandwich&quot;.

=== Committee assignments ===
*Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Capital Markets

=== Caucus membership ===
* Congressional Black Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption
* Congressional Equality Caucus
* Congressional Caucus for the Equal Rights Amendment
* Rare Disease Caucus

=== Tenure ===
During his tenure, Cleaver has voted with the Democratic Party 95.8% of the time. He has been recognized as &quot;not shy about earmarks&quot; and has brought many federal tax dollars back to Kansas City. As of 2022, he had voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time, according to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;.

Cleaver has called for ethics charges against fellow U.S. Representatives Charlie Rangel and Maxine Waters to be dropped, saying, &quot;The process has been tainted.&quot;

On December 18, 2019, Cleaver voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and is one of only two Missouri House members to do so, along with Lacy Clay.

=== Office attack ===
On September 11, 2014, around 2:50 a.m., what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of Cleaver&#x27;s Kansas City office. He was in Washington D.C. at the time and no staff members were present during the attack.

== Political campaigns ==

In late 2003, Karen McCarthy, who had represented the 5th congressional district since 1995, announced her retirement. Though he served in city government for 20 years, including eight as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections, but defeated former Clinton Administration official Jamie Metzl in the Democratic primary, 60%-40%. In the general election, Republican Jeanne Patterson made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as Missouri&#x27;s second-most Democratic district, behind the St. Louis-based 1st. The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949. McCarthy won 65% of the vote in 2002.

=== 2008 Democratic presidential primary election ===
During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, Cleaver endorsed Hillary Clinton. He claimed that African American superdelegates who supported Clinton were subjected to harassment, threatened with primary opponents and called &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot; He said they were told, &quot;&#x27;You’re not black if you’re not supporting Barack Obama&#x27; … It&#x27;s ugly.&quot; On March 30, 2008, Cleaver said he realized he was on the losing team: &quot;Even though I don&#x27;t expect the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Indianapolis Colts, I cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs.&quot; According to BlackMissouri.com., U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois asked Cleaver, &quot;If it comes down to the last day and you&#x27;re the only superdelegate? … Do you want to go down in history as the one to prevent a black from winning the White House?&quot; Cleaver said, &quot;I told him I&#x27;d think about it.&quot; Cleaver said during the primary he&#x27;d be shocked if Obama wasn&#x27;t the next president but made clear he still supported Clinton until she suspended her bid.

== Political positions ==
Cleaver voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

== Electoral history ==



























== Personal life ==
Emanuel Cleaver and his wife, Dianne, have four children. They reside in Kansas City.

In 2000, a road in Kansas City was renamed Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard. The new route consisted of Brush Creek Blvd., E. 47th St., and the portion of Van Brunt Blvd. south of 31st St.

In 2012, Bank of America sued Emanuel and Dianne Cleaver and Cleaver Company LLC, alleging that the company had defaulted on a $1.46 million commercial real estate loan obtained a decade earlier for a Grandview car wash. In 2013, the lawsuit was settled. Cleaver&#x27;s congressional wages were garnished to repay the money owed.

In June 2023, Emanuel Cleaver officiated the wedding of fellow Democratic Congressman and former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

<doc id="1160412" wikidata="Q392355" url="?curid=1160412" title="Rambo III">
<text>Rambo III is a 1988 American action film directed by Peter MacDonald and co-written by Sylvester Stallone, who also reprises his role as Vietnam War veteran John Rambo. A sequel to &quot;&quot; (1985), it is the third installment in the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise.

The film depicts fictional events during the Soviet–Afghan War. In the film, Rambo sets out on a dangerous journey to Afghanistan in order to rescue his former commander and his longtime best friend, Col. Sam Trautman, from the hands of an extremely powerful and ruthless Soviet Army colonel who is bent on killing both Trautman and Rambo, while helping a local band of Afghan rebels fight against Soviet forces threatening to destroy their village.

&quot;Rambo III&quot; was released worldwide on May 25, 1988. At the time of its release, &quot;Rambo III&quot; was the most expensive film ever made with a production budget between $58 and $63 million. The film was not well received by critics and grossed less than its predecessor, &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot;, earning $189 million worldwide.

A sequel, &quot;Rambo,&quot; was released in 2008 with Stallone reprising his role and also directing the film.

==Plot==

After leaving the military behind, former U.S. Army Green Beret John Rambo has settled in a Thai Buddhist monastery, helping with construction work and competing in krabi–krabong matches in Bangkok, donating his winnings. His old friend and ally Colonel Sam Trautman visits and explains that he is putting together a mercenary team for a CIA-sponsored mission to supply the Mujahideen and other tribes as they fight the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. Despite being shown photos of civilians suffering at the hands of the Soviets, Rambo refuses to join, as he is tired of fighting. Trautman proceeds anyway but is ambushed at the border by Soviet forces, who kill his team and capture him. Trautman is sent to a large mountain base to be interrogated by Soviet Colonel Zaysen and his henchman Sergeant Kourov.

Embassy official Robert Griggs informs Rambo of Trautman&#x27;s capture but refuses to approve a rescue mission for fear of drawing the U.S. into the war. Aware that Trautman will die otherwise, Rambo receives permission to undertake a solo rescue on the condition that he will be disavowed in the event of capture or death. Rambo flies to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he convinces arms dealer Mousa Ghani to bring him to Khost, the town closest to the Soviet base where Trautman is held captive.

The Mujahideen in the village, led by chieftain Masoud, hesitate to help Rambo free Trautman. Meanwhile, a Soviet informant in Ghani&#x27;s employ alerts the Soviets, who send two attack helicopters to destroy the village. Though Rambo destroys one with a DShK heavy machine gun, the rebels refuse to aid him any further. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid, Rambo attacks the base and inflicts significant damage before being forced to retreat. Rambo and Hamid are wounded during the battle, and Rambo sends him and Mousa away before resuming his infiltration.

Evading base security, Rambo reaches and frees Trautman before he can be tortured with a flamethrower. He and Trautman rescue several other prisoners and hijack a helicopter to escape the base, but it is damaged during takeoff and crashes, forcing the escapees to flee on foot. An attack helicopter pursues Rambo and Trautman to a nearby cave, where Rambo destroys it with an explosive arrow. A furious Zaysen sends Spetsnaz commandos under Kourov to kill them, but they are routed and killed. An injured Kourov fights Rambo in hand-to-hand combat, but is overcome and killed as well.

Rambo and Trautman make their way to the Pakistani border but are intercepted by Zaysen and his mechanized infantry. Suddenly, Masoud&#x27;s Mujahideen forces, including Mousa and Hamid, arrive to rescue them in a massive cavalry charge. In the midst of the battle, Rambo hijacks a tank and fights Zaysen&#x27;s Mi-24 Hind-D, culminating in a head-on charge as both unleash their vehicles&#x27; weaponry on each other; Rambo survives by destroying the Hind-D with his tank main gun before it can ram him, killing Zaysen. After the battle, Rambo and Trautman bid farewell to the Mujahideen and leave Afghanistan.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
Sylvester Stallone later said his original premise of the film &quot;was more in keeping with the theme of &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot;, but set in Afghanistan.&quot;

&quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;Red Heat&quot; scribe Harry Kleiner was hired to write a draft, but his script was rejected by Stallone.
Several weeks into filming, many of the film&#x27;s crew were fired including the director of photography and director Russell Mulcahy. Stallone said:

The canvas of this movie is so large you have to constantly think 10 scenes ahead. You can&#x27;t wing it. They didn&#x27;t go into the Battle of Waterloo not knowing what their strategy would be. Well, this movie is kind of like a cinematic warfare. We have a huge cast and crew (more than 250 people) and tough locations to deal with. Everyone and everything has to coordinate.

===Pre-production===
In a 2008 online Q&amp;A, Stallone stated that a disagreement over casting led to him firing Russell Mulcahy as the director:
He went to Israel two weeks before me with the task of casting two dozen vicious looking Russian troops. These men were to make your blood run cold. When I arrived on the set, what I saw was two dozen blond, blue-eyed pretty boys that resembled rejects from a surfing contest. Needless to say Rambo is not afraid of a little competition but being attacked by third rate male models could be an enemy that could overwhelm him. I explained my disappointment to Russell and he totally disagreed, so I asked him and his chiffon army to move on.

Mulcahy was replaced by Peter MacDonald, a veteran second unit director. It was MacDonald&#x27;s first film as director but he was very experienced and had directed the second unit action sequences in &quot;&quot;. MacDonald later said, &quot;I tried very hard to change the Rambo character a bit and make him a vulnerable and humorous person, I failed totally.&quot; &quot;I knew instinctively what was a good and bad shot,&quot; he added. &quot;Stallone knew his character because it was his third outing as Rambo. I wasn&#x27;t shooting Shakespeare and at times it was hard to take it seriously.&quot; MacDonald shot the stick fighting sequence in Bangkok himself using a handheld camera.

The character Masoud, played by Greek actor Spiros Focás, was named after Mujahideen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud who fought the Soviets and later the Taliban.

===Filming===
The film was shot in Israel, Thailand, and Arizona. According to MacDonald, the producers :

There were so many restrictions in Israel, where you could and couldn&#x27;t shoot. The producers and Stallone decided they would go back to Arizona where they had looked long before I was on the film. There was a group there called the re-enactors. We had around two hundred and fifty of these guys who re-enact the American Civil War. They were called on to do fight sequences, which they loved.

The scenes at the Thai temple at the beginning of the film were filmed at Wat Phra Phutthabat Tak Pha in Lamphun province.

===Equipment===
The Mil Mi-24 helicopters seen in the film are modified Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma transport helicopters with fabricated bolt-on wings similar to the real Hind-Ds which were mainly used in the former Eastern Bloc. The other helicopter depicted is a slightly reshaped Aerospatiale Gazelle.

===Dedication===
The film ends with the on-screen caption, &quot;This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan.&quot; At some point after the September 11 attacks, an urban legend began that the dedication had actually read &quot;... to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan&quot; when the film was released in theaters, but then changed to &quot;the gallant people of Afghanistan&quot; after the 2001 attacks, since the Mujahideen were now associated to some extent with the Taliban. This urban legend has been repeated by some scholars. However, this is untrue, and some reviews of the film upon its release even mentioned the &quot;gallant people of Afghanistan&quot; dedication.

==Music==
An extensive film score was written by Oscar-winning American composer Jerry Goldsmith, conducting the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra; however, much of it was not used. Instead, much of the music Goldsmith penned for the previous installment was recycled. The original album, released by Scotti Bros., contained only a portion of the new music as well as three songs, only one of which was used in the film (Bill Medley&#x27;s version of &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;, played over the end credits).

==Release==
===Marketing===
The trailer to the film had a negative response with reports of US audiences booing it.

===Cut version===
Potentially owing to the proximity of its release to the Hungerford massacre, one minute and five seconds of footage was removed from the film before it could be granted an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification; the amount of deletions was then nearly tripled for its initial video release. Almost all of this footage was restored to the film upon video submission in 2000, aside from a compulsory cut for animal cruelty.

===Home media===
&quot;Rambo III&quot; was released on DVD on November 23, 2004, and a Blu-Ray release followed on May 23, 2008. &quot;Rambo III&quot; was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on November 13, 2018.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Rambo III&quot; opened in the United States on May 25, 1988, at 2,562 theaters in its opening weekend (the four-day Memorial Day weekend), ranking #2 behind &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot;. Overall, the film grossed $53.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $135.3 million overseas, giving &quot;Rambo III&quot; a box office total of $189 million. The film was considered to have under-performed in comparison to the previous film in the series, which grossed nearly three times as much domestically. Some critics noted that the timing of the movie, with its unabashedly anti-Soviet tone, ran afoul of the opening of communism to the West under Mikhail Gorbachev, which had already changed the image of the Soviet Union to a substantial degree by the time the film was finished.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 37 reviews, and with an average rating of 4.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Rambo III&quot; finds its justice-dispensing hero far from the thoughtful drama that marked the franchise&#x27;s beginning -- and just as far from quality action thriller entertainment.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 36 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

On &quot;At the Movies&quot;, prominent critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert agreed that &quot;Rambo III&quot; delivers all the mechanical elements that audiences expect from a big budget action movie but lacks the heart seen in similar films such as the &quot;James Bond&quot; series and even its immediate predecessor, &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot;. Siskel gave it a &quot;thumbs up&quot;, while Ebert said he was undecided; however, at the end of the show Ebert&#x27;s vote was logged as a &quot;thumbs down&quot;.

Janet Maslin, reviewing the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described &quot;Rambo III&quot; as a modernization of the western film and said that &quot;modern special-effects technology, a huge budget and Mr. Stallone&#x27;s own derring-do have conspired to let the film pack a wallop that no traditional western or war film could match.&quot; She criticized the political themes as one-dimensional, but applauded the film&#x27;s sense of fun and willingness to engage in self-deprecating humor, though she noted that there are also many unintentionally humorous lines.

In West Germany, the Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung (FBW), a government film rating office whose ratings influence financial support to filmmakers, earned criticism after it awarded a &quot;worthwhile&quot; rating (in German: &quot;wertvoll&quot;) to &quot;Rambo III&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Other media==

===Sequel===

A sequel titled &quot;Rambo&quot;, was released in 2008.

===Novelization===
David Morrell, author of &quot;First Blood&quot;, the novel the first &quot;Rambo&quot; film is based on, wrote a novelization called &quot;Rambo III&quot;.

===Comic books===
A comic book adaptation of the film was published by Blackthorne Publishing. Blackthorne also published a 3D version of its &quot;Rambo III&quot; comic.

===Video games===
Various companies released video games based on the film, including Ocean Software and Taito. In 1990, Sega released its own game based on the film for the Master System and Genesis/Mega Drive. Sega later adapted some of the battle scenes in the film for the 2008 arcade game &quot;Rambo&quot;. In 2014, the film was incorporated into &quot;&quot;, based on the first three &quot;Rambo&quot; films.

===In popular culture===

* In the film &quot;Twins&quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character looks at a poster of &quot;Rambo III&quot; featuring Stallone. He compares his biceps to Stallone&#x27;s, but waves it off with a smile while shaking his head and walks away.
* In the film &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;, an American parody film of &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot; and &quot;Rambo III&quot; with the colonel role reprised by Richard Crenna

<text>Luminate Data, LLC (formerly MRC Data and P-MRC Data) is a provider of music and entertainment data. Established as a joint-venture in 2020, it brought together Nielsen Music, Alpha Data (formerly BuzzAngle Music) and Variety Business Intelligence (formerly TVtracker). 

In December 2019, Eldridge Industries&#x27; Valence Media, then parent company of &quot;Billboard&quot;, acquired Nielsen&#x27;s music data business, reuniting it with &quot;Billboard&quot; for the first time since its spin-off to E5 Global Media from Nielsen Business Media. It was renamed MRC Data in 2020 after Eldridge Industries merged Valence with the film and television studio MRC. and was then brought under its PMRC joint venture with Penske Media Corporation as P-MRC Data. It was renamed once more to Luminate Data in March 2022. In August 2022, the MRC merger was unwound, with Eldridge Industries taking sole ownership of its stake in PMRC.

== Nielsen Music ==
Nielsen Music, originally established by Mike Fine and Mike Shalett in 1991, collects music consumption and sales weekly and makes this available every Sunday (for album sales) and every Monday (for song sales) to subscribers, which include record companies, publishing firms, music retailers, independent promoters, film and TV companies, and artist managers. It is the source of sales information for the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts. The company operates the analytics platform Music Connect, Music 360 and Broadcast Data Systems (which tracks airplay of music), the latter of which was shut down in September 2022.

Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for Nielsen on March 1, 1991. The May 25 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; published &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Country Album charts based on SoundScan &quot;piece count data&quot;, and the first Hot 100 chart to debut with the system was released on November 30, 1991. Previously, &quot;Billboard&quot; tracked sales by calling stores across the U.S. and asking about sales—a method that was inherently error-prone and open to outright fraud. Indeed, while transitioning from the calling to tracking methods, the airplay and sales charts (already monitored by Nielsen) and the Hot 100 (then still using the calling system) often did not match (for instance Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Promise of a New Day&quot; and Roxette&#x27;s &quot;Fading Like a Flower&quot; reached much higher Hot 100 peaks than their actual sales and airplay would have allowed them to). Although most record company executives conceded that the new method was far more accurate than the old, the chart&#x27;s volatility and its geographical balance initially caused deep concern, before the change and the market shifts it brought about were accepted across the industry. Tower Records, the country&#x27;s second-largest retail chain, was originally not included in the sample because its stores were equipped with different technology to measure sales. At first, some industry executives complained that the new system—which relied on high-tech sales measurement rather than store employee estimates—was based on an inadequate sample, one that favored established and mainstream acts over newcomers.

The Recording Industry Association of America also tracks sales (or more specifically, shipments minus potential returns) on a long-term basis through the RIAA certification system; it has never used either Nielsen SoundScan or the store-calling method.

The first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one song via Nielsen SoundScan was &quot;Set Adrift on Memory Bliss&quot; by P.M. Dawn.

Other changes would also largely impact the Hot 100 in the future, consisting of radio-only songs being able to chart in 1998, and YouTube views playing part of how a Hot 100 is decided in 2013.

Sales data from cash registers is collected from 14,000 retail, mass merchant, and non-traditional (on-line stores, venues, digital music services, etc.) outlets in the United States, Canada, UK and Japan.

The requirements for reporting sales to Nielsen Music are that the store has Internet access and a point of sale (POS) inventory system. Submission of sales data must be in the form of a text file consisting of all the UPCs sold and the quantities per UPC on a weekly basis. Sales collected from Monday–Sunday or Sunday–Saturday are reported every Monday and made available to subscribers every Wednesday. Anyone selling a music product with its own UPC or ISRC may register that product to be tracked by Luminate.

Not all retailers participate in the SoundScan program, so total CD sales are projected from the collected data using a statistical calculation called &quot;weighting&quot;. This assigns a multiplier to each category of stores, to compensate for the number of similar stores not covered by the sampling program. Sales in each category are multiplied accordingly.

Such a system is vulnerable to exploitation if it is known which stores are included in the sampling program. To inflate their reported chart sales, some indie labels were reported to purposefully target stores in the program for on-site sales promotions. Also, other labels were found shipping boxes of their CDs to be scanned by complicit retailers in the program.

The incorporation of SoundScan tracking by the &quot;Billboard&quot; charting system was cited by the industry as a possible cause of the early &#x27;90s popularization of alternative music in the United States. An explanation floated was that the previous call system under-represented marginal genres. Under SoundScan, more accurate data on alternative music sales allowed these acts to appear higher in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts than before, and their chart success helped increase the genre&#x27;s popularity. In addition, SoundScan sales data quickly found use in the promotion departments at major record labels, to persuade radio station music directors to play tracks by high-selling alternative artists such as Nirvana.

<text>Worms Armageddon is a 1999 turn-based strategy video game developed and published by Team17 as part of the &quot;Worms&quot; series. It was originally released for the Microsoft Windows operating system, and was later ported to the PlayStation, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Color. In the game, the player controls a team of up to eight earthworms tasked with defeating an opposing team using a wide range of weapons at their disposal. The game takes place on a destructible and customizable two-dimensional board and is characterized by cartoonish graphics and a unique brand of humour.

The third installment in the series, &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was originally developed as an expansion pack to &quot;Worms 2&quot; (1997) and initially titled &quot;Wormageddon&quot; before it was released as a standalone game. As a result the game is very similar to &quot;Worms 2&quot; but has a new single-player mode and adds a number of pieces of new content as well as being released on a wider variety of platforms. &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was acclaimed by critics, who praised the refined gameplay and stylized graphics, and it has been featured in a number of &quot;greatest games of all time&quot; lists. &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; on PC is still updated periodically, most recently in 2020. The game was succeeded by &quot;Worms World Party&quot; (2001), which added further content without drastic change and which was the last 2D-based &quot;Worms&quot; game before the series moved to 3D.

In August 2024, a port of the PC version to then-current and last generation consoles, titled &quot;Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&quot;, was announced for release on 26 September. This version includes a digital museum and the emulated version of the Game Boy Color port as bonus features.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is turn-based, with each team moving in sequence, which is determined randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move one of their worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.

Each worm begins the round with a specific amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending upon the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced to zero or by being knocked into the water around and below the level.

The game includes a wide variety of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

===Gameplay modes===
&quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; includes a series of training missions, a single-player campaign with premade missions, a deathmatch mode in which the player fights increasingly difficult and outnumbered battles against the computer, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer.

Local multiplayer allows the player to select which teams participate in the battle as well as the number of worms and handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color – they will still operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.

Online multiplayer is set up similarly to local multiplayer but allows the players to be at separate computers. Additionally, hotseat can be combined with online play, so multiple human players can use each computer.

&quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; features a multiplayer Internet service called WormNet. This service allows one player to host a game online and others to join it. The host can choose settings such as the landscape and scheme. In the past, it used to keep a score and ranking system for the players.

===Customization===
&quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; includes a very high level of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, how long a turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.

The game offers players the ability to create their own custom teams. Each team has its own name and includes eight individually named worms. The player can also change the team&#x27;s special weapon, grave marker, flag, victory fanfare, and voice set. In addition to numerous defaults available, the game offers the ability to import custom voices.

The game includes a random terrain generator, a basic terrain editor which allows the user to create the shape of the terrain with brushes, and a more complex terrain-import system which allows the user to import custom-made terrains in image format, which the game automatically converts into playable terrains.

==Development==
&quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was originally intended to be an expansion pack to &quot;Worms 2&quot;, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It was intended to be the last game of the &quot;Worms&quot; franchise, but &quot;Worms&quot; creator Andy Davidson felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of &quot;Worms World Party&quot;. It was also going to be released under the name &quot;Wormageddon&quot;, but Team17 changed the name to &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; because of close similarities to the name of the game &quot;Carmageddon&quot;. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and North America, published by Hasbro Interactive under the MicroProse brand. The game was eventually ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation in December 1999, Game Boy Color in January 2000, and Nintendo 64 in March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game&#x27;s lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game&#x27;s lead artist.

&quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was initially released on the Steam platform for a limited time as the preorder bonus for &quot;Worms Revolution&quot;. The Steam release included all improvements from the previously-released updates. This release was made available on 12 September 2012. &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was released onto the Steam store as a standalone game on 20 March 2013.

Despite its age, &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; still receives periodic updates, mainly from two programmers known as Deadcode and CyberShadow, recruited by Team17. These updates address bugs and compatibility issues, and also add new features to the game, such as support for a greater number of worms in a match and support for arbitrarily-sized colour levels. The latest update was on 16 July 2020.

==Reception==
The game received favorable reviews on all platforms. The main element across all the versions of the game that the critics considered praiseworthy is the gameplay.

The PC version was critically successful. Whilst writing that veterans of &quot;Worms 2&quot; would find the game to be similar, Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game for being easy to play and control and humorous and the game&#x27;s graphics, physics, and seemingly endless customization as well as the game&#x27;s WormNet. He also likened the single-player missions to the classic game of &quot;Lemmings&quot; in that the missions often required the player to precisely utilize a limited supply of weapons and tools to accomplish the objective. Among his only criticisms are that the AI-controlled worms do not utilize their full arsenals and that the player would wish that there were more weapons, more diverse graphics and sound, and more content. Matthew Pierce of &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; commended Team17 for addressing the problems of single-player (i.e. the missions and AI) that the original &quot;Worms&quot; and &quot;Worms 2&quot; had always been criticized for. Chris Hudak of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; gave it a perfect ten, calling it &quot;a gaming masterpiece.&quot; Tom Chick of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;For all its similarities to previous cans of &quot;Worms&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot; is still a classic example of the joy of computer gaming. It&#x27;s right up there with rare, benevolent gems like &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; and &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;--games that&#x27;ll make you smile and even giggle like a schoolgirl. And when it comes right down to it, I&#x27;d rather giggle for an hour than spend all day grimly swinging away at orcs or aiming plasma weapons.&quot; Dan Toose of &quot;Hyper&quot; gave it 87%, calling it &quot;A fitting end to an excellent series of games [and a] perfect blend of serious strategy and ludicrous humour.&quot; Nick Smith of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it four stars out of five, calling it &quot;very, very addictive&quot;. Cindy Vanous of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; gave it a similar score of four stars out of five, saying, &quot;In short, it seems that Team 17 figured out every detail that might have detracted even slightly from &quot;Worms 2&quot;, then recreated the game without those tiny flaws. The result is eminently playable and often hysterical—in fact, the only thing serious in &quot;Armageddon&quot; is its strategy.&quot;

The Dreamcast version&#x27;s reception was positive. Johnny Liu of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; praised the version for its &quot;addictive&quot; gameplay, its loads of personality, and not having to save money to buy multiple controllers for multiplayer, but criticized the version for the lack of Internet support, reduced customizations compared to the PC version, and the lack of a multiple-controller option. On the contrary, Ben Stahl of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the multiple controller ports as well as multiplayer for being fast-paced and turned into a &quot;barrage of havoc&quot;, but criticized the single-player for the AI-controlled worms&#x27; nearly perfect accuracy and the length of time that it takes for such worms to complete their turns. He also pointed out that the worms&#x27; high-pitched voices are &quot;only mildly cute&quot; and can potentially be annoying, but praised the soundtracks for lending in realism to an otherwise unrealistic experience and the background music for helping players stay on task. Joel Durham Jr. of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it four stars out of five, saying, &quot;With fabulous gameplay and a stunning amount of options, &quot;Worms: Armageddon&quot; is sure to please. The sheer amount of effort that went into this title is commendable in its own right. Every development house could learn something by taking a few pages from Team 17&#x27;s book.&quot; Cam Shea of &quot;Hyper&quot; gave it 79%, saying, &quot;if this is the kind of no frills PC port we can expect for the Dreamcast, don&#x27;t toss out your N64 just yet. You may just need it if you want to play the best version of &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; on the block.&quot;

Jeff Nash of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; gave the PlayStation version nine out of ten almost a year after it was released, calling it &quot;a wonderful breath of fresh air for strategy gaming. With its carefree, happy-go-lucky attitude, it&#x27;s easy to just fall in love with this title. With a multi-player mode thrown in for good measure, this game has a fantastic one-two punch of great gameplay, and an easy setup for sharing it with others, making it a very fun experience. With a liberal dose of humor present as well, this game is a wonderful romp through the grueling world of worm warfare.&quot; However, Mark Kanarick of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, &quot;Although not the best version of &quot;Worms&quot;, &quot;Worms: Armageddon&quot; for the PlayStation is a good party game and an occasionally fun single-player game.&quot;

The Game Boy Color port slightly favorable reviews. Concluding that the port is an &quot;abridged edition of the overall game&quot;, Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the version&#x27;s great lack of the PC version&#x27;s features (e.g. weapons) and personality and pointed out its &quot;quirky&quot; graphics. The reviewer felt that the game&#x27;s front end was &quot;extremely thrown together&quot;. He concluded that it was still fun to play. Hudak of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; gave it seven out of ten, similarly criticized the lack of weapons, and also criticized the lack of soundbites and complete lack of voices and what he perceived to be &quot;microscopic&quot; worms that are tough for the eye to see. He did, however, praise the terrain and physics engine for being well translated from the other versions of the game. Jason White of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it three stars out of five, saying that it &quot;has so much going for it in the fun department that the odd controls and sometimes hard to navigate terrain will be easily forgotten. Go out and give this one a try. It&#x27;s well worth the time.&quot;

Many publications gave the Nintendo 64 version favorable reviews while it was still in development months before its U.S. release date. Lou Gubrious of &quot;GamePro&quot; said that the game&#x27;s European import &quot;won&#x27;t dazzle you with graphics or stun you with sound, but it will suck you in with its simple playability. Before you know it, you&#x27;ll glance up from the TV only to be greeted by the sun, rising like an eye-piercing, flaming disk punishing you for staying up all night again.&quot; Arthur Adam of &quot;Hyper&quot; gave the same Nintendo 64 version 89%, saying, &quot;This strategy game has proved to be dynamite on the N64, making it possibly the best multi-player title for the console.&quot; Marin Kitts of &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; gave it 85%, calling it &quot;A welcome conversion of one of the most original four-player games you can buy.&quot; However, Michael Wolf of &quot;NextGen&quot; called the same console version &quot;A good rental if you&#x27;re planning a gaming party, but for day-to-day gaming, these annelids just don&#x27;t cut it.&quot;

The PlayStation version received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units in the UK.

===Awards===
The PlayStation and Dreamcast versions won the award for &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot; at the &quot;EGM&quot; Game Blast Awards. The PC version was nominated for the same category at the Sixth Annual &quot;PC Gamer&quot; Awards, which went to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;. The staff wrote that the game &quot;put up one hell of a fight [for the award] and should not be overlooked by fans of the genre.&quot; The console versions were nominated for the same category at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, which went to &quot;Ogre Battle 64&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; has been placed on several lists of the greatest games of all time. &quot;Digital Spy&quot; ranked &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; at No. 18 on their list of the top 20 Nintendo 64 games of all time. In 2014, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; ranked the game at No. 13 on their list of the top 50 PlayStation games of all time. In 2015, they also ranked it at No. 68 on their list of the top 100 video games of all time. In 2014, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the game at No. 100 on their similar list. &quot;TechRadar&quot; listed the game as one of their favourite PC games of all time.

Team17 chose to base the source code of the 2016 game &quot;Worms W.M.D&quot; entirely on that of &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot;, because fans frequently told them upon questioning that &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; was their favourite game in the series. Additionally, the 2009 game &quot;Worms 2: Armageddon&quot; was named in honor of &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; despite not being a direct sequel.

In 2022, the PlayStation versions of &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Worms World Party&quot; were added to the PlayStation Store as part of the first batch of downloadable PlayStation titles; the games run on emulation on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, but do not feature trophies.

<doc id="1160429" wikidata="Q950713" url="?curid=1160429" title="Foreshock">
<text>A foreshock is an earthquake that occurs before a larger seismic eventthe mainshockand is related to it in both time and space. The designation of an earthquake as &quot;foreshock&quot;, &quot;mainshock&quot; or aftershock is only possible after the full sequence of events has happened.

==Occurrence==
Foreshock activity has been detected for about 40% of all moderate to large earthquakes, and about 70% for events of M&gt;7.0. They occur from a matter of minutes to days or even longer before the main shock; for example, the 2002 Sumatra earthquake is regarded as a foreshock of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake with a delay of more than two years between the two events.

Some great earthquakes (M&gt;8.0) show no foreshock activity at all, such as the M8.6 1950 India–China earthquake.

The increase in foreshock activity is difficult to quantify for individual earthquakes but becomes apparent when combining the results of many different events. From such combined observations, the increase before the mainshock is observed to be of inverse power law type. This may either indicate that foreshocks cause stress changes resulting in the mainshock or that the increase is related to a general increase in stress in the region.

==Mechanics==
The observation of foreshocks associated with many earthquakes suggests that they are part of a preparation process prior to nucleation. In one model of earthquake rupture, the process forms as a cascade, starting with a very small event that triggers a larger one, continuing until the main shock rupture is triggered. However, analysis of some foreshocks has shown that they tend to relieve stress around the fault. In this view, foreshocks and aftershocks are part of the same process. This is supported by an observed relationship between the rate of foreshocks and the rate of aftershocks for an event. In practice, there are two main conflicting theories about foreshocks: earthquake triggering process (described in SOC models and ETAS-like models) and the loading process by aseismic slip (nucleation models). This debate about the prognostic value of foreshocks is well known as Foreshock Hypothesis.

==Earthquake prediction==
An increase in seismic activity in an area has been used as a method of predicting earthquakes, most notably in the case of the 1975 Haicheng earthquake in China, where an evacuation was triggered by an increase in activity. However, most earthquakes lack obvious foreshock patterns and this method has not proven useful, as most small earthquakes are not foreshocks, leading to probable false alarms. Earthquakes along oceanic transform faults do show repeatable foreshock behaviour, allowing the prediction of both the location and timing of such earthquakes.

== Examples of earthquakes with foreshock events ==
* The strongest recorded mainshock that followed a foreshock is the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, which had a magnitude of 9.5 MW.

<doc id="1160435" wikidata="Q6517386" url="?curid=1160435" title="Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard">
<text>The Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard is a set of file format specifications intended to facilitate electronic data transmission in the legal industry. The phrase is abbreviated LEDES and is usually pronounced as &quot;leeds&quot;. The LEDES specifications are maintained by the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC), which started informally as an industry-wide project led by the Law Firm and Law Department Services Group within PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1995. In 2001, the LEDES Oversight Committee was incorporated as a California mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation and is now led by a seven-member Board of Directors. 

The LOC maintains four types of data exchange standards for legal electronic billing (ebilling); budgeting; timekeeper attributes; and intellectual property matter management.

The LOC also maintains five types of data elements in the LEDES data exchange standards: Uniform Task-Based Management System codes, which classify the work performed by type of legal matter; activity codes, which classify the actual work performed; expense codes, which classify the type of expense incurred; timekeeper classification codes; and error codes, which assist law firms with understanding invoice validation errors. 

The LOC has also created an API that allows for system-to-system transmission of legal invoices from law firms and other legal vendors required by their clients to ebill, to the third-party ebilling systems. Other functionality is also supported in this very complex standard, which is intended to ease the burden at the law firm for managing client-required ebilling.
==Electronic billing formats==
The electronic billing data exchange format types provide a standard data format for electronically transmitted invoices, typically from a law firm to a corporate client. The LEDES e-billing format currently has the following variations:
* LEDES 1998, the first &quot;LEDES&quot; format, created in 1998, but no longer in use. The format does not appear on www.LEDES.org. 
* LEDES 1998B, a pipe-delimited plain text file. The standard was adopted in 1998, and it is the more commonly used LEDES format in the US. It lacks flexibility, having a rigid structure, and does not support taxes on legal fees. Another disadvantage of LEDES 1998B is that invoice-level data is repeated on every line item even though it is only needed once, as it does not vary per line. Many clients attempt to impose nonstandard customizations, thus defeating the purpose of having a standard. Nonetheless, US-based law firms prefer it for its simplicity and familiarity.
* LEDES XML 2000, adopted in 2000, is an older XML format that uses a DTD. In LEDES 2000, although the structure is well defined, the specification defines &quot;extend&quot; segments, allowing the insertion of client-specific fields without breaking the format or violating the standard. The format is no longer supported by the LEDES Oversight Committee and information on the format will be removed from www.LEDES.org on February 1, 2024.
* LEDES 1998BI (international), a pipe-delimited plain text file, proposed in 2004 by the Legal IT Innovators Group (LITIG) and ratified by the LEDES Oversight Committee in 2006. Based on the LEDES 1998B standard, it includes all of the fields in the LEDES 1998B format, plus additional ones. This format was designed to accommodate legal bills generated outside of the United States and allows for one tax per line item. 
*LEDES XML 2.0, an XML format that uses XSD. It was ratified in 2006 and addresses international needs in XML format. Unlike earlier LEDES formats, XML 2.0 represents the nature of the financial transaction between the parties. It supports multiple taxes on line-items and provides AFA Support. It contains 15 segments and 156 data elements.
*LEDES XML 2.1, ratified in 2008. It contains all of the data points in XML 2.0, plus additional segments and data elements to provide: enhanced tax functionality with support for Withholding and Credit Notes; and invoice-level global extensibility. It contains 16 segments and 194 data elements.
*LEDES XML 2.2, ratified in 2020. It contains all of the data points in XML 2.1, plus additional segments and data elements to support tiered taxes. It contains 18 segments and 206 data elements. 

==Other data exchange formats==
The other LEDES data exchange formats are as follows:
*LEDES Budget was ratified in 2006. This XML format facilitates the exchange of budget data between law firms and clients.
*LEDES Timekeeper Attribute was ratified in 2007 and revised in 2014. This XML format used to transmit timekeeper and rate data to from law firms to clients.
*IPMM Invention Disclosure Standard was ratified in 2015. This is a set of XML schemas that can validate an XML document containing invention disclosure data.

==UTBMS==

The Uniform Task-Based Management System is a widely used system for coding legal work.

In April 2006, the UTBMS Update Initiative voted to merge into the LEDES Oversight Committee. Shortly thereafter, the LEDES Oversight Committee established www.UTBMS.com as the global reference for all known UTBMS standards, regardless of the organization that established the standard.
==LEDES Error Codes - Version 2==

In 2020, the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC) ratified Version 1 of the LEDES Error Codes, which aimed to establish a standardized framework for identifying errors in electronic billing (e-billing) submissions. In September 2024, Version 1 was fully updated and replaced by Version 2, which was ratified by the LEDES Board. This new version continues the mission of standardizing the identification of errors in e-billing submissions across different systems and clients.

Why LEDES Error Codes?

The introduction of LEDES Error Codes addresses a longstanding issue expressed by many law firm members. Prior to the standardization, law firms and corporate legal departments spent significant time tracking down errors caused by non-standardized and often unintelligible error messages in e-billing submissions. These error messages gave little indication of what needed to be fixed, resulting in wasted hours and inefficient workflows.

The standardized Error Codes are designed to make e-billing error identification more consistent and easier to understand, which will help reduce the time law firms, corporate legal departments, and software vendors spend on correcting billing errors. The hope is that the implementation of these standardized error codes across the industry will streamline the billing process and reduce the administrative burden on legal teams, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of legal billing practices.

==2024 LEDES Oversight Committee Board of Directors==

The 2024 Board of Directors of the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC) plays a critical role in overseeing the development and implementation of LEDES standards, including the new version of the LEDES Error Codes. The following individuals serve on the 2024 LOC Board:

President: Jane A. Bennitt, Global Legal Ebilling, LLC

<doc id="1160439" wikidata="Q5291068" url="?curid=1160439" title="Dominion Range">
<text>The Dominion Range () is a broad mountain range, about long, forming a prominent salient at the juncture of the Beardmore and Mill glaciers in Antarctica. The range is part of the Queen Maud Mountains
The range was discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907–09 and named by Ernest Shackleton for the Dominion of New Zealand, which generously aided the expedition.

==Location==
Plunket Point, at the northern tip of the Meyer Desert, is the northernmost point of the range, where the Mill Glacier to the east of the range converges with the Beardmore Glacier to the west.
The Rutkowski Glacier forms to the west of the Meyer Desert and flows south past Mount mills.
The Koski Glacier flows east past the Kane Rocks to the south and Browns Butte to the north into Mill Glacier.
The Vandament Glacier is south of the Kane Rocks and west of Safety Spur.
The south of the range includes Mount Saunders, Mount Nimrod and Mount Tennent.
The Davis Nunataks and Mount Ward are to the south of the range.

The Polar Subglacial Basin lies between the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains and the Dominion Range.

== Key geographical features ==
Features, from north to south, include:

===Plunket Point===
A conspicuous rock point marking the northern end of the Dominion Range and the confluence of the Beardmore and Mill Glaciers. 
Discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition (1907–09) and named for Lord Plunket, at that time Governor of New Zealand.

===Meyer Desert===
A triangular ice-free area of about at the north end of the Dominion Range, near the confluence of the Beardmore and Mill Glaciers. 
Named by New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) (1961–62) for George Meyer of the United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP), who was scientific leader at McMurdo Station, 1961, and led a field party into this area, summer 1961-62.

===Rutkowski Glacier===
A glacier which drains the northern part of the Dominion Range icecap eastward of Mount Mills. 
It descends northeastward into Meyer Desert where it terminates without reaching Beardmore Glacier. 
Named by United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Richard L. Rutkowski, USARP meteorologist at the South Pole Station, 1962.

=== Mount Mills ===
A mountain, high, forming part of the north escarpment of the Dominion Range, overlooking the Beardmore Glacier north of Mount Saunders.

<text>God Lives Underwater was an American rock band, formed during 1993 in Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania by vocalist/programmer David Reilly and guitarist/programmer Jeff Turzo. They were later joined by guitarist Andrew McGee and drummer Adam Kary (who was replaced by Scott Garrett in 1998). After recording a self-titled EP in late 1993 and self-distributing it the following year, the band signed to Rick Rubin&#x27;s label American Recordings, and the EP was nationally released in early 1995. Later that same year, the band released the full-length album &quot;Empty&quot;. God Lives Underwater then signed with A&amp;M Records and released &quot;Life in the So-Called Space Age&quot; in 1998, which spawned their most successful single &quot;From Your Mouth&quot;. After a period of internal issues and label shifts, the band&#x27;s final album was released in 2004, &quot;Up Off the Floor&quot;. Reilly then unexpectedly died at the age of 34 on October 16, 2005.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;God Lives Underwater&quot; (1993–1995)===
David Reilly had recorded various home demos in the late 1980s and early 1990s as he handled the vast majority of the vocals and instruments on his own. Jeff Turzo was a studio engineer as he created remixes and assisted in the studio for artists such as Pop&#x27;s Cool Love and Fishbone among others. Reilly and Turzo had attended the same high school together in the town of Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania (near the city of Philadelphia), and after graduation, the duo decided to form a band which had electronica and industrial influences, eventually named God Lives Underwater. In late 1993, they recorded a six-track demo tape on their own. Throughout 1994, the pair had self-released the EP (titled as &quot;God Lives Underwater&quot;) as they also passed it on to various labels and friends. Prolific producer Rick Rubin obtained the EP, and subsequently signed the duo to his label American Recordings. Reilly and Turzo then decided to transform their project into a full-fledged band; thus, they added drummer Adam Kary and guitarist Andrew McGee into the lineup. American then gave &quot;God Lives Underwater&quot; a proper national release in January 1995. It gained coverage in various publications as it peaked at No. 82 on &quot;CMJ&quot;&#x27;s Radio Top 150 chart. &quot;No More Love&quot; was released as the sole single, and a music video was produced which depicted the band outdoors near a nuclear power plant. Around the same time, &quot;Drag Me Down&quot;, also from &quot;God Lives Underwater&quot;, had appeared in the comedy film &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;.

About four months after the release of &quot;God Lives Underwater&quot;, &quot;No More Love&quot; was featured during the end credits of the film &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; and was included on its soundtrack. Another music video was created for the track, which intertwined scenes of &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; and of the band. During the first half of 1995, God Lives Underwater went on a national tour, co-headlining with the band Maids of Gravity (which was formed by former Medicine founding member Eddie Ruscha). At a June show in Rochester, New York, Reilly had attempted to hype the fans in attendance. Numerous people then started to throw objects at the security guards and police officers, and the officers ended up using pepper spray on the audience. Kary was physically assaulted and maced while Reilly was arrested, and he spent the night at the local jail along with a dozen other fans. He was later charged with a misdemeanor for inciting a riot. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 40 hours of community service. Around the same time, Reilly and Turzo recorded two songs (&quot;Someone Else&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;) for a Nitrus Records compilation (simply titled &quot;The Compilation&quot;) under the alias of Heavy. McGee had also contributed two tracks to the compilation (&quot;Sunking&quot; and &quot;Track #12&quot;) under the alias of Sputnik.

===&quot;Empty&quot; and increased activity (1995–1997)===
God Lives Underwater had recorded their full-length album throughout 1995. In September 1995, the song &quot;Tortoise&quot; (off of the then-upcoming album) was featured in the movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Senior Trip&quot;. The following month, American released the band&#x27;s full-length album &quot;Empty&quot;. It peaked at No. 83 on &quot;CMJ&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 chart. &quot;No More Love&quot; was included on its tracklist, while both &quot;All Wrong&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Know How to Be&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s singles. The video for &quot;All Wrong&quot; had exclusively premiered on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; program. God Lives Underwater initially embarked on a tour of the U.S. with KMFDM, and they followed it with a tour of Europe with Filter. Afterwards, they headlined their own tour throughout the U.S. and then opened for Spacehog. After a show in Florida, God Lives Underwater was kicked off of Spacehog&#x27;s tour. God Lives Underwater claimed that they were drawing in more fans and selling more merchandise than Spacehog which led to the majority of the attendees leaving prior to Spacehog&#x27;s performance; however, Spacehog claimed that God Lives Underwater&#x27;s fans were too violent and had caused too much trouble during the shows.

In early 1996, God Lives Underwater had recorded the music for the shooting video game &quot;Slamscape&quot;, released on PlayStation and PC. They had created original compositions for the in-game music. The videos for &quot;No More Love&quot; (the original 1994 version), &quot;Don&#x27;t Know How to Be&quot;, and &quot;All Wrong&quot; was included as bonus content. &quot;Slamscape&quot; received below average reviews, although many critics praised the band&#x27;s contributions. Also in 1996, God Lives Underwater contributed the song &quot;Weight&quot; to the &quot;Mortal Kombat: More Kombat&quot; compilation. It was an outtake from the &quot;Empty&quot; recording sessions. The band also toured with Far for a brief U.S. tour in the middle of 1996. Towards the end of the year, the band decided to add a fifth member to the lineup, Dave Alverado. He was on-stage as an extra bassist in an attempt to make the band&#x27;s live-sound thicker; however, by 1997, Alverado was no longer in the band and the lineup reverted to four members. After the extensive touring schedule, God Lives Underwater&#x27;s manager Gary Richards started his own label, 1500 Records. They were in a partnership with the major label A&amp;M Records for distribution purposes and God Lives Underwater became one of the first acts signed with the label.

===&quot;Life in the So-Called Space Age&quot; and mainstream success (1997–2000)===
In 1997, God Lives Underwater went to Los Angeles, California to record their follow-up album with producer Gary Dobbins. During the recording process, there were creative tensions with drummer Kary. Afterwards, he was dismissed from the band, and was ultimately replaced by Scott Garrett. Garrett was previously a member of The Cult and also Pop&#x27;s Cool Love, who Turzo worked with in the early 1990s.

The resulting album, &quot;Life in the So-Called Space Age&quot;, was released in March 1998. It became the band&#x27;s best-selling effort (eventually selling over 90,000 copies) as it peaked at No. 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers chart and at No. 137 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Its lead single, &quot;From Your Mouth&quot;, appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart at No. 17 and on &quot;R&amp;R&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Top 50 chart at No. 18. Its music video was directed by Roman Coppola (the son of famed director Francis Ford Coppola). The video was a single take played in reverse and it featured champion hot-dog eater Hirofumi Nakajima taking food out of his mouth. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Rearrange&quot; was also released as a single, but it failed to match its predecessor&#x27;s success. God Lives Underwater supported &quot;Life in the So-Called Space Age&quot; by embarking on a U.S. tour with Stabbing Westward and Econoline Crush. 

Also in 1998, God Lives Underwater was at the helm of the Depeche Mode tribute album &quot;For the Masses&quot;, released on 1500. They had kickstarted the project and had recorded a cover of &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot; for the compilation. Other artists that were brought in for the compilation included The Cure, Failure, The Smashing Pumpkins, GusGus, Veruca Salt, Dishwalla, Meat Beat Manifesto, Monster Magnet, Apollo 440, Deftones, Rammstein, Rabbit in the Moon, Self, Locust, and Hooverphonic. The compilation eventually peaked at No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

===Various issues and &quot;Up Off the Floor&quot; (2000–2004)===
God Lives Underwater had begun recording their subsequent album in 2000, but various problems emerged. The band&#x27;s manager, Richards, and his 1500 label had faced financial difficulty. They were unable to sufficiently promote God Lives Underwater, and Richards eventually sold the label to the website &quot;Riffage&quot;. In addition, tragedy struck the band when Reilly&#x27;s fiance, Monica &quot;Seven&quot; Young, was accidentally killed on-foot by a train while crossing the tracks with headphones on. Her death had impacted Reilly greatly, and his drug usage increased as a result. He also spent time in various jails and facilities, and claimed to be homeless at one point as well.

The band played a live show on July 13, 2000 in Hollywood, California. A few songs in their setlist were tracks off of the band&#x27;s then-upcoming album; however, the live show ultimately ended up being the band&#x27;s final performance. They continued recording regardless of the various issues, and in early 2001 the band contributed a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;15 Minutes&quot; (which starred Robert De Niro and Edward Burns). &quot;Fame&quot; was also released as a standalone single to promote the soundtrack. The single ended up being the final God Lives Underwater release by 1500 as shortly after, 1500&#x27;s then-new parent company &quot;Riffage&quot; had declared bankruptcy, thus dropping the band before their album was released.

From 2001 to 2003, God Lives Underwater was mostly inactive as the members pursued different projects. Turzo got married and then focused on studio work for various bands such as Incubus, Taproot, and Lostprophets. Garrett briefly rejoined The Cult and also worked with artists such as Kottonmouth Kings, The Mission UK, and J. McGee took a break from the music industry, and didn&#x27;t appear with any other acts during that time. Reilly released a solo album titled &quot;Robot Teen America&quot; in May 2001. He then reconciled with God Lives Underwater&#x27;s original drummer Kary, and they formed the band Fluzee in 2002. They released an EP that same year before disbanding.

In late 2003, the Spanish label Locomotive Music (owned by Megaforce Records) had bought the rights to release God Lives Underwater&#x27;s completed album. They had reportedly paid the band upfront to exclusively release it. The album, titled &quot;Up Off the Floor&quot;, was officially released in early 2004, but it had contained numerous errors. There were various grammatical errors in the liner notes, two songs from the same era were excluded from the tracklist (the aforementioned &quot;Fame&quot; cover and also the outtake &quot;Choir Boy&quot;), and the album itself was not sourced from the master recordings; thus, the volume and mix was lowered and the quality suffered as a result. Promotional copies of &quot;Up Off the Floor&quot; had also existed which had superior audio quality, and overall, the band members were dismissive of the Locomotive pressing; however, Locomotive attempted to promote the album by issuing the track &quot;Tricked&quot; as a radio single without much success.

===Reilly&#x27;s death and subsequent events (2004–2014)===
After the troublesome release of &quot;Up Off the Floor&quot;, God Lives Underwater remained in hiatus. The following year, Reilly decided to embark on a solo career once again. In June 2005, Reilly signed to RuffNation Records (which was a division of the major label Universal Records). He also began collaborating and recording new material centered around the death of his fiancée with former Spiritualized guitar player Gregg Hale. A few months later Reilly died on October 16. He was 34. It was later discovered that he had died due to an untreated tooth infection. In 2006, Turzo formed the band Wired All Wrong with Matt Mahaffey of the band Self. They both bonded over the loss of their former bandmates (as Matt Mahaffey&#x27;s brother Mike Mahaffey also of Self had died in May 2005). Both Garrett and McGee also eventually joined Wired All Wrong as the drummer and guitarist respectively.

In October 2007, Brian Paone (a close friend of Reilly and the band) released the book &quot;Dreams are Unfinished Thoughts&quot;, which chronicled his relationship with God Lives Underwater and Reilly in particular. In 2010, Reilly&#x27;s RuffNation/Universal solo album, &quot;How Humans Rx&quot;, was released in limited form. Various other unreleased recordings by Reilly also surfaced afterwards, and Paone also updated &quot;Dreams are Unfinished Thoughts&quot; in 2014 with extra passages which detailed events from 2007 to 2014.

<doc id="1160447" wikidata="Q16147973" url="?curid=1160447" title="Disability in the United States">
<text>People with disabilities in the United States are a significant minority group, making up a fifth of the overall population and over half of Americans older than eighty. There is a complex history underlying the U.S. and its relationship with its disabled population, with great progress being made in the last century to improve the livelihood of disabled citizens through legislation providing protections and benefits. Most notably, the Americans with Disabilities Act is a comprehensive anti-discrimination policy that works to protect Americans with disabilities in public settings and the workplace.

== Definitions ==
According to the Social Security Advisory Board, when the federal government first began provisioning funds for state-run disability assistance programs, eligible beneficiaries were defined as needing to be &quot;totally and permanently disabled&quot;. In 1956, this definition was expanded by the Disability Insurance Program to describe disability as the &quot;inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration.&quot; Critics indicated that this language limited the concept of disability to an occupational scope, and more holistic definitions were adopted as time passed. The modern consensus on disability within governmental, medical, sociological realms in the United States is that it includes impairments that either physically or mentally incapacitate individuals from engaging in significant life activities, or the perception of possessing such an impairment. For instance, in a 2013 study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluated disability across five dimensions: vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living. Specific conditions that fall under this umbrella vary circumstantially, however it is broadly accepted that disability includes, but is not limited to the following:

* Autism
* Autoimmune conditions (ex. lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS)
* Blindness or poor vision
* Cancer
* Cardiovascular or heart disease
* Celiac disease
* Cerebral palsy
* Deaf or hard of hearing
* Depression or anxiety
* Diabetes
* Epilepsy
* Gastrointestinal disorders (ex. Crohn&#x27;s disease, Irritable bowel syndrome)
* Intellectual disability
* Missing limbs or partially missing limbs
* Nervous system conditions (ex. migraine headaches, MS, Parkinson&#x27;s disease)
* Psychiatric conditions (ex. bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia)

== History ==
At a federal level, legislation pertaining to disability was limited in the 18th and 19th centuries, with notable laws at that time including an act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, which was signed by John Adams in 1798. In the early 1900s eugenic sterilization laws were passed in several states, permitting governments to conduct forced sterilization on individuals with mental disorders. The 1927 Supreme Court case &quot;Buck v Bell&quot; upheld the constitutionality of such legislation, with such laws being banned nearly half a century later with the 1978 Federal Sterilization Legislation, although loopholes have been exploited with such sterilizations continuing into modern times. The burgeoning of disability rights legislation in the 1900s came after World War I with congress&#x27; establishment of the Rehabilitation Programs, which provided education and healthcare support to recovering veterans. Significant progress came in the 1930s with the presidential election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was physically disabled himself, and his signage of the Social Security Act.

One of the first prominent groups that formed together to advocate for Disability Rights in America, was the League of the Physically Handicapped. The League of the Physically Handicapped was organized in the early 1930s. This group was very outspoken against Franklin D. Roosevelt, and about how disabled people were being discriminated against in the workplace. As a result, The League of the Physically Handicapped were targeted by the Roosevelt administration. More progress towards disability justice came in hand with the civil rights movement in the latter half of the 20th century. In 1961 the American National Standards Institute published a document overviewing building accessibility limitations for physically disabled individuals, which supported the passage of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and encouraged several states to adopt inclusive accessibility legislation in the &#x27;70s. Additionally in the 1960s, Medicaid and the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act were passed, allocating funds towards healthcare and the developments of statewide councils, advocacy frameworks, and post-secondary education pathways for disabled citizens. In the 1970s major anti-discrimination legislation was enacted with the repeal of the last &quot;Ugly law&quot;, which permitted law enforcement to incarcerate people for appearing disabled, as well as the 1973 Rehabilitation Act and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which prevented institutions that received public funding from discriminating on disability status. The 1980s oversaw saw an additional movement towards accessibility with the passage of the Air Carrier Access Act, Fair Housing Amendments Act, and Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act and justice with the creation of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).

In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) served as a landmark bill outlining more comprehensive protections and accommodations for the disabled community, with other legislation, introduced later that decade such as the 1996 Telecommunications Act and the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA) expanding upon the ADA. The turn of the Millennium oversaw crucial Supreme Court cases such as &quot;Olmstead v. L.C.&quot; and &quot;Tennessee v. Lane&quot; which upheld federally outlined disability rights.

==Demographics==
According to the &quot;Disability Status: 2019 - Census 2019 Brief&quot; approximately 20 percent of Americans have one or more diagnosed psychological or physical disability:

This percentage varies depending on how disabilities are defined. It may be helpful to note that disability in the United States is classified under different types of physical or mental impairments of which include one&#x27;s ability to physically function, mental status, including decision skills and memory, the ability of sight, if they are self-sufficient, and finally, if they depend on anyone to help them do tasks . According to &quot;Census Brief 97-5&quot;, &quot;About 1 in 5 Americans have some kind of disability, and 1 in 10 have a severe disability. Not only does this statistic affect those who are disabled, but individuals with disabilities not only endure disadvantages but so do their children or possibly grandchildren as they can potentially be left facing health care disadvantages as well as education.&quot;

The United States Census Bureau is legally charged with developing information on the type and prevalence of disability in the population. Statistics reveal the highest percentage of individuals with a disability reside in southern areas such as Texas, Florida, Mississippi, and anywhere along the southern coast. The states that include the fewest disabled individuals are western areas of which will include Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. These disabled people are protected by three primary laws. They include the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The primary purpose of collecting ACS data on disability is to help the U.S. Congress determine the allocation of federal funds and inform policies. It is also used to identify the characteristics of the disabled population of the United States. Determining the number and geographical location of people with disabilities is crucial for policies aimed at providing services like public transportation.

ACS does not directly measure disability There are other smaller survey studies that provide some insight on disability in the U.S. While studies like the National Health Interview Survey the Health and Retirement Study, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study are used to infer valuable disability-related health characteristics in the U.S. population. While responses to these items are commonly refer to as &quot;disability&quot;, it could be argued the 
—it uses self- and proxy-reports to evaluate perceived ability to perform functional tasks. Existing publications have delineated details on the U.S. population regarding disability by using information from the ACS. Publications have also outlined issues with disability data in the ACS. Research on disability continues to improve, and potential remedies are found for current methodological challenges. Because of the uniqueness, regarding federal funding and policy, researchers from various fields (e.g., sociology, epidemiology, and government) make wide use of ACS data to better understand disability in the U.S.

===African Americans===
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the African American community has the highest rate of disability in the United States at 20.8 percent, slightly higher than the overall disability rate of 19.4 percent. Given these statistics, it can be suggested that African Americans with disabilities experience the most severe underemployment, unemployment, and under-education compared to other disability groups. For instance, the 2015 American Community Survey indicates that African Americans who have disabilities live in poverty at a rate of 1.5 to 2 times greater than other racial groups in America.

==== Criminal justice ====
Data obtained in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth indicates that Black men with disabilities encounter the greatest cumulative probability of being arrested by age 28, in contrast to others with either different gender, disability, or race status. With respect to African American women re-entering society after serving time, a &quot;JHCPCU&quot; article identified disability, more specifically positive HIV/HCV status, as a major factor correlated with lowered usage of various modes of health care such as alternative and emergency care. Calls for civil rights and criminal justice reform with the Black Lives Matter movement have brought into public eye how Black individuals with disabilities disproportionately experience police violence. Instances cited as police brutality, such as the 2018 killing of Marcus-David Peters, an unarmed black man experiencing a mental health crisis, has motivated legislation such as Virginia&#x27;s Mental Health Awareness Response and Community Understanding Services (MARCUS) alert bill, which would necessitate that cases of individual mental distress be attended to by both police and mental health professionals. Viral footage of the killing of Walter Wallace, a black man with a history of mental illness who was killed during a police encounter, has helped bring the Black Disabled Lives Matter movement into the public eye.

==== Education ====
Work published in the &quot;Journal of African American History&quot; suggest that the enduring consequences of segregation and separation of special education classrooms can potential have a negative compound effect on the quality of education for African American students with disabilities. An article in the &quot;Harvard Educational Review&quot; suggests that educational pedagogy designed to &quot;cross-pollinate&quot; across race and disability coalitions is an effective way to combat exclusion that particularly impacts Black disabled children.

==== Employment ====
According to a study published in the &quot;Journal of Disability Policy&quot;, Black people with disabilities experience significantly higher unemployment and lower monthly wages compared to the overall disabled community and general population. A research paper in the &quot;Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling&quot; reported that counseling professionals identified that disability status can limit employment prospects of Black and Latino offenders seeking work opportunities.

==== Healthcare ====
Disabled Black Americans face barriers to receiving comprehensive medical care to address their pre-existing health conditions. In studies published in the &quot;Journals of Applied Gerontology&quot; it was noted that elderly African American women face a greater likelihood of acquiring disability in comparison their white counterparts, and additionally are more likely to rely on medicaid for coverage. The same journal articles established a correlation between being uninsured or utilizing medicaid coverage with greater levels of disability. With respect to disabled youth, it was found that when controlling for socioeconomic and insurance status, Hispanic and Black children with disabilities were less likely to have received specialty medical care in comparison to children from other racial backgrounds according to research published in the journal &quot;PEDIATRICS&quot;.

==Disparities==
===Discrimination in employment===

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires all organizations that receive government funding to provide accessibility programs and services. A more recent law, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which came into effect in 1992, prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, or in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. This includes organizations like retail businesses, movie theaters, and restaurants. They must make reasonable accommodation to people with different needs. Protection is extended to anyone with (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (B) a record of such an impairment, or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. The second and third criteria are seen as ensuring protection from unjust discrimination based on a perception of risk, just because someone has a record of impairment or appears to have a disability or illness (e.g. features which may be erroneously taken as signs of an illness). Employment protection laws make discrimination against qualified individuals with a disability illegal and may also require the provision of reasonable accommodation. Reasonable accommodations includes changes in the physical environment like making facilities more accessible but also include increasing job flexibility like job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules or reassignment to vacant position. Though many hold attitudes that are more enlightened and informed than past years, the word &quot;disability&quot; carries few positive connotations for most employers. Negative attitudes by employers toward potential employees with disabilities can lead to misunderstanding and discrimination.

=== Healthcare disparities ===

The disability paradox, a concept that recognizes the tendency for individuals without disabilities to perceive their disabled counterparts as having poorer livelihoods than disabled individuals would view themselves, is perpetuated in healthcare settings, with research published in the &quot;Handbook of Disability Studies&quot; identifying that practitioners award lower quality of life scores to disabled individuals than a member of the general population would. An article in the &quot;Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal&quot; expresses that as a consequence physicians frequently go into consults with rigid, skewed perceptions of their patient&#x27;s disabilities. Anita Ho, a bioethicist, argues that heightened practitioner confidence can harmfully impact disabled individuals in this regard as it increases the likelihood that patients may distrust their physicians or conversely place excessive faith in their care provider&#x27;s insight into their condition. Disparate in healthcare access also impact disabled populations, for instance, most rural areas — especially in the Great Plains region — have little or no government-organized medical support infrastructure for the permanently disabled indigent population which results in disability in the United States not only affecting individuals physically and mentally but socioeconomically as well.

===Poverty===

Investigations on the &quot;poverty and disability nexus&quot; have consistently shown poverty and disability are correlated for all race-ethnic groups within the United States. Financial stability of people with disabilities would decrease the dependence on governmental support programs. Studies have been done with the U.S. Census Bureau data to examine the high prevalence of disabilities among welfare recipients. Thirteen percent of families with children under the age of 18, who are also receiving welfare benefits, had at least one child with a disability. Families with income below twice the poverty line were 50 percent more likely to have a child with a disability than those families with higher incomes. Children with disabilities from families with annual household incomes of higher than $50,000 were more likely to attend higher education.

Research suggests higher education does impact employment and income opportunities for people with disabilities. It is also noted near equivocal employment opportunities and salaries for people with disabilities to their peers without disabilities. While only one-fifth of people in the U.S. have at least a four-year college degree, some studies note possessing a four-year degree is the difference between absolute job security and joblessness.

==Public resources==
===Social Security Administration===
The Social Security Administration (SSA), defines disability in terms of an individual&#x27;s inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA), by which it means &quot;work paying minimum wage or better&quot;. The agency pairs SGA with a list of medical conditions that qualify individuals for disability benefits. Individuals who are disabled will receive insurance and this ensures they will always be getting paid when they must take time off work or cannot work due to the severity of their illness. The SSDI and the SSI are both social security programs that will assist in payments.

The SSA makes available to disabled Americans two forms of disability benefits: Social Security Disability Insurance, (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Briefly, the SSDI is a program that is useful in the sense that it is like welfare, but you must have been able to work enough hours throughout your life and you must have paid social security taxes in order to be approved. This benefit is most useful for those who do not have severe disabilities or illnesses because those who are immobile will not have been able to work. The good thing about this benefit does not only do it benefit the individual, but it will benefit their family members as well. To go more in-depth, Social Security pays disability benefits to citizens who have worked long enough and have a medical condition that has prevented them from working or is expected to prevent them from working for at least 12 months or end in death. 
Looking at the SSI, the SSI insurance, or the Social Security Insurance program, is there to pay individual benefits who could not have worked or have little capital. However, for both of these insurances, the same approval is required by the individual&#x27;s disability.
Some assistance ends if the beneficiary starts working. If that assistance (such as personal care or transportation) is necessary for work, it creates a welfare trap where it is not possible to work despite potentially being willing and able. Some programs do provide incentives to work.

===Education===
====K-12====
Before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed, children with disabilities were at-risk of not receiving a free, appropriate public education, but each act protecting the disabled individuals protects different criteria of which include differentiation in schools, the law by which schools must be up to date on the K-12 act, and equal service for the public who extend any services. For IDEA to apply, the child must first be determined to be able to benefit from public education. This benefit is not exclusively limited to school-aged children but applies to children with disabilities from infancy.

Due to the societal stigma of disability, children are sometimes treated like disabled children, and not included in activities in which other children were able to participate. However, for These individuals with any type of disablement such as learning disabilities or physical disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act covers them. This act ensures no one is discriminated against beyond their own home of which includes work, school, and anywhere in public. The places it does not cover will include sanctioned or private areas including one&#x27;s home. Educators can hold students with disabilities to lower expectations, which impacts their future educational attainment. Although their future may be impaired the K-12 act is broad amongst education and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act will help clarify. This act ensures individuals who attended schools, play on school sports teams, or attend any off or on-campus events will be protected unless that school is not funded by the government. These students must be given compromises that other students may not receive due to their impairments.

Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the school district must provide every disabled child with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The IEP is compiled by a team of school administrators and guardians and may include a child advocate, counselors, occupational therapists, or other specialists. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures all fees for schooling are discharged, but these children must be approved under IDEA and must be in a certain category of disabilities. This act allows for any student or child to be assessed and is provided extra incentives that may apply to their condition. The IEP also evaluates the goals for the child and determines what needs to be done in order for those goals to be met. Children with disabilities who do not have a parent or guardian advocating on their behalf are not as well served in the education system as their peers with parent or guardian advocates.

Transition preparation from K-12 education to post-secondary education or career was initially written into IDEA to begin at age 12, but in the existing law, transition preparation does not begin until age 16. While this law provides a maximum age at which to begin transition preparation, students with disabilities have been known to receive transition preparation at a younger age, as the states might mandate a younger age, or the IEP team might determine a younger age is appropriate to begin the transition preparation of the student. Some students with disabilities have noted not receiving any transition preparation at all. The transition services are to be designed to be results-oriented rather than outcome-oriented. This is to ensure the transition services are designed for the student&#x27;s success. Students are intended to attend their transition planning meetings with the IEP, yet not all students do. Some do attend, yet generally not take a leadership role - only fourteen percent do. This places the students with a disability in a passive role instead of an agentic role in their own life plans. In a 2007 study of a higher education institution located in the Midwestern United States, it was found that one-third of students with disabilities felt their transition preparation was lacking. Many in this group were unaware of laws that pertained to disability and higher education. This leaves them without an understanding of their learning needs and unable to advocate for themselves.

====Higher Education====
Self-advocacy plays an important role in the success of students with disabilities in higher education. While the examination of self-advocacy skills has been largely limited to the impact in academic settings, self-advocacy skills, or the lack thereof, do also impact non-academic situations. A 2004 study noted that only 3 percent of students with disabilities had self-advocacy training. Students with disabilities who are confident about their disability identity and self-advocacy skills are more likely to disclose their disabilities and advocate for their needs when interacting with faculty and staff. Advocacy service is also provided to students as staff from different programs help instructors in college, understand the needs of disabled students who are attending their classes. So much so that when disable students need extra time to complete their course then some arrangements are made to accommodate such students. Students with disabilities who were embarrassed of their disability identity and did not understand their needs as learners looked to faculty and staff for solutions to accommodation needs. Education helps students with disabilities learn self-advocacy skills that affect their ability to advocate for their health, insurance, and other needs.

In spite of IDEA and Section 504 providing support for the education of people with disabilities, the educational outcomes of people with disabilities vary significantly from the outcomes of people without disabilities. After high school, a 2005 study found students with disabilities enroll in postsecondary education, whether college, technical school or vocational school, at a rate of 46 percent compared to the rate of 63 percent for students without disabilities. This rate is up 23 percent since 1990, when the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was passed. Specifically to four-year degree-granting higher education institutions, 27 percent of students with disabilities attend compared to 54 percent of students without disabilities. High school completion and postsecondary education enrollment vary per disability type.

Students with disabilities are responsible for advocating for their accommodations and needs as learners in higher education environments. Many higher education institutions have staff to work with students with disabilities on their accommodation requests. Higher education institutions do vary in process to obtain accommodations and accommodations provided. The staff members at the higher education institutions can recommend accommodations. The faculty members, however, may choose to vary or not implement the accommodations at all based upon concerns of weakening the academic integrity of the course or risking the possibility of endless accommodation requests. When working with faculty members about accommodations, nearly half of the students with disabilities recalled receiving a negative response, while the other half felt their faculty members were accommodating.

For people with disabilities, having a four-year college degree provides significant employment and salary advantages.

===Employment and minimum wage exemption===
More than 56 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare.
Disabled citizens in the United States receive Medicare insurance and social security benefits to varying degrees. For those that seek employment for therapeutic or economic reasons, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is applicable. This act was an attempt to facilitate the large number of disabled servicemen returning from the front lines &quot;to the extent necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment&quot;. Section 14(c) provides the employers with a method of paying their disabled employees less than applicable federal minimum wage. The Secretary of Labor issues certificates that align wages with the employee&#x27;s productivity.

 there are 420,000 §14(c) employees being paid less than the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Administratively, the wage for disabled people was informally set at 75 percent. Those working in sheltered work centers have no minimum floor for their wage. The Fair Wages for Workers with Disabilities Act was proposed in 2013 to repeal §14(c) but was not passed.

===Insurance===
It is illegal for California insurers to refuse to provide car insurance to properly licensed drivers solely because they have a disability. It is also illegal for them to refuse to provide car insurance &quot;on the basis that the owner of the motor vehicle to be insured is blind&quot;, but they are allowed to exclude coverage for injuries and damages incurred while a blind unlicensed owner is actually operating the vehicle (the law is apparently structured to allow blind people to buy and insure cars which their friends, family, and caretakers can drive for them).

==Policies and legislation==

The Department of Labor&#x27;s 2014 rules for federal contractors, defined as companies that make more than $50,000/year from the federal government, required them to have as a goal that 7 percent of their workforce must be disabled people. In schools, the ADA requires that all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible. The U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, commonly known as the Access Board, created the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to help offer guidelines for transportation and accessibility for physically disabled people.

About 12.6 percent of the U.S. population are individuals who have a mental or physical disability. Many are unemployed because of prejudiced assumptions that a person with disabilities is unable to complete tasks that are commonly required in the workforce. This became a major human rights issue because of the discrimination that this group faced when trying to apply for jobs in the U.S. Many advocacy groups protested against such discrimination, asking the federal government to implement laws and policies that would help individuals with disabilities.

===Rehabilitation Act of 1973===
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was enacted with the purpose of protecting individuals with disabilities from prejudicial treatment by government-funded programs, employers, and agencies. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has not only helped protect U.S. citizens from being discriminated against but it has also created confidence amongst individuals to feel more comfortable with their disability. There are many sections within The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that contains detailed information about what is covered in this policy.

; Section 501
: An employer must hire an individual who meets the qualifications of a job description despite any preexisting disabilities.
; Section 503
: Requires contractors or subcontractors, who receive more than $10,000 from the government to hire people with disabilities and to accommodate them with the needs that they need to achieve in the workforce.
; Section 504
: States that receive federal money may not discriminate against any person with disabilities who qualifies for a program or job.

On June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in &quot;Olmstead vs. L. C.&quot; that said unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities constitutes discrimination in violation of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This has been interpreted as meaning people with disabilities must be given all opportunities by the government to stay in their own homes as opposed to assisted living, nursing homes or worse, institutions for disabled people. It has been interpreted as meaning the government must make all reasonable efforts to allow people with disabilities to be included in their respective communities and enjoy family and friends, work if possible, get married, own homes and interact with nondisabled people.

===The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990===
The federal government enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which was created to allow equal opportunity for jobs, access to private and government-funded facilities, and transportation for disabled people. This act was created with the purpose to ensure that employers would not discriminate against any individual despite their disability. In 1990, data was gathered to show the percentage of disabled people who worked in the U.S. Out of the 13 percent who filled out the survey, only 53 percent of individuals with disabilities worked while 90 percent of this group population did not, the government wanted to change this, they wanted Americans with disabilities to have the same opportunities as those who did not have a disability. The ADA required corporations to not only hire qualified disabled people but also accommodate them and their needs.

; Title I: Employment
: An employer must give a qualified individual with disabilities the same opportunities as any other employee despite their disability. The employer must offer equal work privileges to someone who has a disability including but not limited to pay, work hours, training, etc. The employer must also create accommodations suitable for the person and their physical or mental disabilities.
; Title II: State and Local Government Activities
: Requires that the government give disabled people the same opportunities involving work, programs, building access, and services. Title II also requires that buildings create easy access for disabled people and provide communicators who will be able to help those with hearing or speaking impairments. Public spaces are however not required to create accommodations that would, in turn, alter their services as long as the services proved that they did all they could to prevent discrimination against disabled people.
; Title II: Transportation
: Public transportation should be customized so that disabled people may have easy access to public transit. Paratransit is a service that provides transportation to people who are unable to get from one destination to another due to their mental or physical disability.
; Title III: Public Accommodations
: Public accommodations require that private businesses create accommodations that will allow disabled people easy access to buildings. Private businesses may not discriminate against disabled people and must provide accommodations that are reasonable, alterations may be made so that a person with disabilities can have equal access to facilities that are provided, communicators for the hearing impaired, devices for the visually impaired, and wheelchair access. Facilities must regulate with the ADA, when regulating the building&#x27;s infrastructure so it meets the ADA regulations.
; Title IV: Telecommunication Relay Services
: Requires telephone companies to have TRS seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. It requires telephone companies to create accommodations for deaf and hard-of-hearing people by providing a third party able to assist both parties in communicating with one another.

==Disability culture==

===Media===
The National Center on Disability and Journalism (NCDJ) provides resources and support to journalists and communications professionals covering disability issues. The center is headquartered at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.

===Arts===
There are many government initiatives that support the participation of people with disabilities in arts and cultural programs. Most U.S. state governments include an accessibility coordinator with their state arts agency or regional arts organization. There are a variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and non-profit groups that support initiatives for inclusive arts and culture.
* Office for Accessibility at the National Endowment for the Arts
* Media Access Group at WGBH WGBH is the Public Television broadcaster for the Boston region. It has three divisions: the Caption Center, Descriptive Video Services (DVS), and the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM). WGBH pioneered accessible television and video in the U.S.
* International Center on Deafness and the Arts provides education, training, and arts projects in areas such as theatre, arts festivals, museums, dance, distance learning, and children&#x27;s programming.

The development of disability arts in the U.S. is also tied to several non-profit organizations such as Creative Growth in Oakland, California, that serves adult artists with developmental, mental and physical disabilities, providing a professional studio environment for artistic development, gallery exhibition and representation and a social atmosphere among peers. Organizations with similar mandates in the Bay Area include Creativity Explored in San Francisco, and NIAD Art Center in Richmond, California.

<doc id="1160459" wikidata="Q5104952" url="?curid=1160459" title="Chorale monody">
<text>In music, a chorale monody was a type of a sacred composition of the very early German Baroque era. It was for solo voice and accompanying instruments, usually basso continuo, and was closely related to the contemporary Italian style of monody. Almost all examples of chorale monodies were written in the first half of the 17th century.

A chorale monody used the text of a chorale, but rarely if ever used the chorale tune, at least not in a recognizable form. It was also related to the concertato madrigal, another contemporary Italian form. While the vocal part in Schein&#x27;s early examples of the genre retained the rhythmic and melodic flexibility of the Italian monody, he replaced the rhythmically vague bass lines of his model with a stricter rhythmic beat in the instrumental accompaniment. The chorale monody formed the basis for the later development of the solo cantata.

== Composers ==

Composers of chorale monodies included:
*Christoph Bernhard
*Andreas Hammerschmidt
*Johann Erasmus Kindermann
*Sebastian Knüpfer
*Tobias Michael
*Johann Hermann Schein
*Johann Schelle
*Heinrich Schütz
*Thomas Selle
*Johann Staden
*Franz Tunder

<text>St. James Town (sometimes misspelled St. Jamestown) is a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It lies in the northeast corner of the downtown area. The neighbourhood covers the area bounded by Jarvis Street to the west, Bloor Street East to the north, Parliament Street to the east, and Wellesley Street East to the south.

St. James Town is the largest high-rise community in Canada. 
It has been identified as one of 13 economically deprived neighbourhoods within the city.
It consists of 19 high-rise buildings (14 to 32 stories). These residential towers were built in the 1960s. Officially, approximately 17,000 people live in the neighbourhood&#x27;s 19 apartment towers and 4 low rise buildings, making it one of Canada&#x27;s most densely populated communities.

==History==
St. James Town began to grow in the 19th century when it became a semi-suburban area home to the city&#x27;s middle class. It was also part of the City Liberties bounded roughly by Bloor, Don River, Dundas and Bathurst.

St. James Ward was rezoned in the 1950s, and the nineteenth century homes were leveled, and apartment towers — inspired by Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Towers in the Park&quot; concept — were erected. Each tower was named after a major Canadian city with some accommodating over 1000 residents. The 14 story Quebec was completed in 1959, the 18 story Victoria in 1965, and The Toronto&#x27;s 24 floors in 1967. In the same census time period (1961 - 1971) St. James Town&#x27;s population grew to 11,462 from only 862.

In the late 1960s, the developers attempted to acquire land south of Wellesley, as far as Carlton Street, to expand the St. James Town development. Many residents of the area resisted, with the support of civic activist and future Mayor of Toronto John Sewell. The St. James Town expansion was cancelled, and the homes that had been demolished were replaced with several housing cooperatives.

The plan for St. James Town&#x27;s highrises was conceived in the 1950s to house young middle class residents who worked downtown. It was spurred forward by the federal government, which saw city building as a key to the nation&#x27;s recovery after the Depression and the Second World War. The buildings failed to attract the large number of demographics the developer envisioned, and the neighbourhood was designed without proper amenities to support the spike in density. Parallel to the development of St. James Town were large suburban developments of detached family homes in the Toronto suburbs. Many prospective tenants chose suburban houses in the developing areas of Scarborough, Etobicoke, and North York. After the first generation of tenants left the buildings, the area quickly started attracting tenants of a lower income bracket. Four buildings were later built by the province to provide public housing. The towers are now mostly home to newly arrived immigrant families, with only 33% being born in Canada, according to the 2011 Census.

After the provincial health care restructuring of the mid-1990s, the Princess Margaret Hospital site on Sherbourne Street became available. In 2001, the City of Toronto launched a major initiative to add social amenities in the area and began the construction of a new Toronto Public Library branch and community centre, which opened in 2004 at the corner of Sherbourne and Wellesley. Lanterra Developments has also proposed plans to replace some of the remaining Victorian homes in St. James Town with several more towers.

On September 24, 2010, a fire broke out on the 24th floor of 200 Wellesley St. East (the white building behind the library and community centre). Fourteen people were taken to hospital due to injuries, including three firefighters and two children. Three of the injuries were classed as serious. The cause of the fire was determined to be a cigarette thrown from a balcony above.

In 2013, St. James Town became the host of the world&#x27;s tallest mural, pending approval by Guinness.

On August 21, 2018, a fire broke out in an electrical box at 650 Parliament St. Two people suffered only minor injuries, but the entire building, containing 1,500 or more people, had to be evacuated. It took six hours to douse the flames. Reports indicated that evacuees would have to wait &quot;several days&quot; before they would be allowed to return. As of May 2019, re-occupancy had been postponed to late that year due to the complexities of restoration work, including the discovery of a &quot;minor amount&quot; of asbestos.

During the heat dome in June 2024, one of the towers had the water supply cut for 13 hours due to an emergency. 

==Demographics==
Census tract 0065.00 of the 2006 Canadian census covers St. James Town. According to that census, the neighbourhood had 14,666 residents at that time. By the 2011 Canadian census, population had fallen to 13,910. In the 2021 Canadian census, the combined census tracts of 0065.01 and 0065.02 showed a population of 13,770.

Average income reported in the 2006 census was $22,341, one of the lowest in Toronto. In the 2011 National Household Survey, the average income of residents in Ontario is reported to be $42,264. When compared to the average income of residents in this Census Tract from the 2011 Census year, this is a difference of $19,923. When further examined against the average income of residents in Canada, whereby it is reported to be $40,650 in the 2011 National Household Survey, the difference remains similar at $18,309. Both of these differences therefore shows us the sharp income disparities in this Census Tract and its resulting socio-economic impacts on its residents (Census 2006, Census 2011). In addition, this can be seen in the income distribution of the neighbourhood in 2011 with 57% of the inhabitants earning less than $19,999 and only 6% earning more than $60,000. In fact the majority of individuals (82.6%) over the age of 15 earn an income of less than $39,999 before tax.

Property ownership in the area is falling. According to census data, in 2006, 50 people owned one of the limited number of older model properties in the area, but by 2011 that number had fallen to 40.

In terms of the 2011 National Household Survey, there was Global Non-Response rate of 21.7% which means that only 25.8% of the population completed the survey. This number is actually higher than the 20% response rate of the 2006 Long Form census, however due to the voluntary nature of the census, the data is not as reliable compared to the mandatory long form census of 2006. This is because when it is a voluntary census rather one required by law, there is a high chance of non-response bias especially as the GNR grows larger which means that there is a higher chance that those who are responding to the voluntary survey is not completely randomized. In comparison to Canada, which has a GNR of 26.1%, and Ontario, which has a GNR of 27.1%, CT5350065.0 has a lower GNR rate which that there may be less of a non-response bias.

=== Immigration Status ===
The 2006 census recorded a total of 14,666 residents in St. James Town, 14,606 of whom identified themselves as immigrants. In 2011, the population was recorded at 13,974, a decline of only 632 people. However, only 8,180 people (59%) identified as immigrants on the census, a decline of 6,426 from five years earlier. 8% of the population identified as non-permanent residents and 33% identified as non-immigrants.

=== Generation Status ===
According to the 2006 long form census and the 2011 National Household Survey the majority of individuals in St. James Town (census tract 5350065.00) would be categorized as being of first generation status (Statistics Canada, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2011). First generation status applies to people who were born outside of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011). Second generation refers to people born in Canada but their mother and father were born outside of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011). The final category, third generation and more, covers people who were born and Canada and both their mother and father were also born in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011).

The following is a breakdown of the percentages of those considered first, second, and third generation or more in St. James Town in both 2006 and 2011.

2006:

First Generation Status: 78%

Second Generation Status: 8%

Third Generation Status and more: 14%

2011:

First Generation Status: 67%

Second Generation Status: 20%

Third Generation Status and more: 13%

From 2006 to 2011 the biggest change in the generation status occurred in the second-generation category where those considered second generation rose 12% from 8% to 20%. This indicates that individuals that were born in Canada with a mother or father born outside of Canada increased from 2006 to 2011. First generation status, on the other hand, decreased (despite still containing the majority of the population both years) and those considered third generation and more decreased by 1%. It can therefore be concluded that the majority of people living in St. James Town were not born in Canada according to both the 2006 long form census (where they accounted for 78% of those who completed the survey) and the 2011 National Household Survey (where they accounted for 67% of those who completed the survey). This information can be related to previously mentioned data on income and immigration status and diversity.

In 2006 the long form census had a 20% completion rate compared to the 2011 National Household Survey, which had a 25.85% completion rate. Therefore, more people completed the survey in 2011 compared to 2006, but as previously mentioned, one must be aware of a possibility of a non-response bias, meaning those answering the survey might not be random and may have affected the data.

=== Languages spoken ===
Due to its cultural and minority demographics, &quot;St. James Town is a world within a block.&quot; It is largely filled with immigrants — especially those who arrived in the 1990s. The ten most common languages in the neighbourhood, after English, are:

#Tagalog - 8.1%
#Tamil - 5.5%
#Unspecified Chinese - 2.5%
#Mandarin - 2.5%
#Korean - 1.9%
#Spanish - 1.8%
#Russian - 1.8%
#Serbian - 1.4%
#Bengali - 1.4%
#Urdu - 1.4%

<doc id="1160466" wikidata="Q6811967" url="?curid=1160466" title="Melbourne tram route 70">
<text>Melbourne tram route 70 is a tram route on the Melbourne tramway network serving the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Operated by Yarra Trams, the route is coloured pink and extends from Waterfront City to Wattle Park over 16.5 kilometre of double track via Harbour Esplanade, Flinders Street, Richmond, Burnley, Hawthorn, Hawthorn East, Camberwell and Surrey Hills. It is serviced out of Camberwell depot utilising A and B class trams.

==History==
Most of the line currently used by route 70 was initially built and run by the Hawthorn Tramways Trust (HTT) in 1916–17. It ran between the Batman Avenue terminus (opposite Flinders Street station) to the intersection of Warrigal Road (then Boundary Road) and Riversdale Road. At the time, the HTT&#x27;s Batman Avenue line was Melbourne&#x27;s only electric tram line that reached the CBD. The Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1920, and in 1928, extended the line a further two kilometres to Wattle Park at the Riversdale Road and Elgar Road intersection. In 1934, the line was given the route 70 designation, which it still holds today.

On 6 June 1999 it was diverted to operate via the Exhibition Street extension with a four-lane divided road built over the Jolimont Yard, enabling Batman Avenue west of Melbourne Park to be closed with route 70 extended to terminate at the intersection of Flinders and Spencer Streets. This new route was better able to serve all of the Melbourne Park venues such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Rod Laver Arena. Extra sidings were also built along the route in order to accommodate special events. On 5 December 1999, at the City end, the route was amended to terminate at new sidings west of Spencer Street.

On 4 May 2003, the route was extended along Spencer Street to the intersection of Spencer and La Trobe Streets, swapping route termini with route 75. Between May and November 2005, the route temporarily terminated at Market Street due to the closure and removal of the Flinders Street Overpass over King Street. After the works were completed, on 21 November 2005, the route was re-extended along Flinders Street and its permanent terminus was altered to the intersection of Bourke Street and Harbour Esplanade at Docklands, no longer running along Spencer Street. The route was extended to Waterfront City in September 2009 to replace route 48 which was re-routed away from Flinders Street and Waterfront City.

==Route==
The route begins at Waterfront City, and runs along Docklands Drive, Harbour Esplanade and Flinders Street in the city, behind Melbourne Park at Richmond and then along Swan Street and Riversdale Road through Hawthorn and Camberwell to the eastern end of Wattle Park, terminating at Elgar Road.

==Operation==

Route 70 is operated out of Camberwell depot with A class trams. Occasionally, B class trams are also used. During the Australian Open, additional services run between Melbourne Park and the city. These services are numbered as route 70a and operated by E class trams.

<doc id="1160467" wikidata="Q503760" url="?curid=1160467" title="Gale Sayers">
<text>Gale Eugene Sayers (May 30, 1943 – September 23, 2020) was an American professional football halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In a relatively brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. He was known for his elusiveness and agility and was regarded by his peers as one of the most difficult players to tackle.

Nicknamed &quot;the Kansas Comet&quot;, Sayers played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks football team of the University of Kansas, where he compiled 4,020 all-purpose yards over three seasons and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American. In Sayers&#x27; rookie NFL season, he set a league record by scoring 22 touchdowns—including a record-tying six in one game—and gained 2,272 all-purpose yards en route to being named the NFL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. He continued this production through his first five seasons, earning four Pro Bowl appearances and five first-team All-Pro selections. A right knee injury forced Sayers to miss the final five games of the 1968, but he returned in 1969 to lead the NFL in rushing yards and be named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. An injury to his left knee in the 1970 preseason as well as subsequent injuries kept him sidelined for most of his final two seasons.

His friendship with Bears teammate Brian Piccolo, who died of cancer in 1970, inspired Sayers to write his autobiography, &quot;I Am Third&quot;, which in turn was the basis for the 1971 made-for-TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;.

Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 at age 34 and remains the youngest person to have received the honor. He is one of five players in the Super Bowl era to be enshrined in the Hall of Fame without ever playing a postseason game. He was named to the NFL&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team as a halfback and kick returner, the only player to occupy two positions on the team. In 2019, he was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. For his achievements in college, Sayers was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the same year. His jersey number is retired by both the Bears and the University of Kansas. Following his NFL career, Sayers began a career in sports administration and business and served as the athletic director of Southern Illinois University from 1976 to 1981.

==Early life==
Gale Eugene Sayers was born to Roger Earl Sayers and Bernice Ross in Wichita, Kansas, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. His father was a mechanic for Goodyear, farmed, and worked for auto dealerships. Sayers&#x27; younger brother, Ron, later played running back for the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League. Roger, his older brother, was a decorated college track and field athlete. Gale graduated from Omaha Central High School, where he starred in football and track and field. A fine all-around track athlete, he set a state long jump record of 24 ft 10 in (7.58m) as a senior in 1961.

==College career==
Sayers was recruited by several major Midwestern colleges before deciding to play football at the University of Kansas. While being interviewed during a broadcast of a Chicago Cubs game on September 8, 2010, Sayers said he had originally intended to go to the University of Iowa. Sayers said that he decided against going to Iowa after the Iowa head coach, Jerry Burns, did not have time to meet Sayers during his one campus visit. During his Jayhawks career, he rushed for 2,675 yards and gained a Big Eight Conference-record 4,020 all-purpose yards. He was three times recognized as a first-team All–Big Eight selection and was a consensus pick for the College Football All-America Team in both 1963 and 1964.

As a sophomore in 1962, his first year on the varsity team, Sayers led the Big Eight Conference and was third in the nation with 1,125 rushing yards. His 7.1 yards-per-carry average was the highest of any player in the NCAA that season. Against Oklahoma State, he carried 21 times for a conference single-game-record 283 yards to lead Kansas to a 36–17 comeback victory. In 1963, Sayers set an NCAA Division I FBS record with a 99-yard run against Nebraska. He finished the year with 917 rushing yards, again leading all rushers in the Big Eight. He earned first-team All-America recognition from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and United Press International (UPI), among others. In 1964, his senior year, he led the Jayhawks to a 15–14 upset victory over Oklahoma with a 93-yard return of the game&#x27;s opening kickoff for a touchdown. He finished the year with 633 rushing yards, third most among Big Eight rushers, and also caught 17 passes for 178 yards, returned 15 punts for 138 yards, and returned seven kickoffs for 193 yards. He earned first-team All-America honors from each of the same selectors as in the previous year, in addition to the Associated Press (AP), among others.

==Professional career==

===1965: Rookie season===
Sayers was the fourth overall selection in the 1965 NFL draft, taken by the Chicago Bears, and was also picked fifth overall by the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League in the AFL draft. After consulting his wife, he decided he would rather play in Chicago, signing with George Halas&#x27;s Bears. In his rookie year, Sayers scored an NFL-record 22 touchdowns: 14 rushing, six receiving, and one each on punt and kickoff returns. He gained 2,272 all-purpose yards, a record for an NFL rookie, with 1,371 of them coming from scrimmage. Sayers averaged 5.2 yards per rush and 17.5 yards per reception. His return averages were 14.9 yards per punt return and a league-high 31.4 yards per kickoff return.

Against the Minnesota Vikings on October 17, Sayers carried 13 times for 64 yards and a touchdown; caught four passes for 63 yards and two touchdowns; and had a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the 45–37 Bears victory. He was the last NFL player to score a rushing, receiving, and kickoff return touchdown in the same game until Tyreek Hill accomplished the feat over 50 years later, in 2016. Bears coach Halas lauded Sayers after the game, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t ever remember seeing a rookie back who was as good,&quot; and deemed his talents equal to former Bears greats Red Grange and George McAfee. &quot;And remember,&quot; said Halas, &quot;we used to call George &#x27;One-Play McAfee&#x27;.&quot; On December 12, Sayers tied Ernie Nevers&#x27; and Dub Jones&#x27; record for touchdowns in a single game, scoring six in a 61–20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers that was played in muddy conditions at the Chicago Cubs&#x27; Wrigley Field. He accounted for 326 yards in the game: 113 rushing, 89 receiving, and 134 on punt returns. Sayers was the consensus choice for NFL Rookie of the Year honors from the AP, UPI, and NEA.

He was quoted as saying at the time:

===1966: First rushing title===
In his second season, Sayers led the league in rushing with 1,231 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry with eight touchdowns, and becoming the first Chicago Bears halfback to win the rushing title since 1949. He also led the Bears in receiving with 34 catches, 447 yards, and two more touchdowns. He surpassed his rookie season&#x27;s kick return numbers, averaging 31.2 yards per return with two touchdowns. He also supplanted his all-purpose yards total from the previous season, gaining 2,440 to set the NFL record. The first of his kickoff return touchdowns that season came against the Los Angeles Rams, as he followed a wedge of blockers en route to a 93-yard score. Against the Minnesota Vikings in the Bears&#x27; final game of the season, and the first of Sayers&#x27; pro career with his parents in attendance, he carried 17 times for a franchise-record 197 yards after returning the opening kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. Sayers was named to All-Pro first-teams by the AP, UPI, the NEA, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and the Pro Football Writers Association, among others. Starring in his second straight Pro Bowl, Sayers carried 11 times for 110 yards and was named the back of the game. The Bears finished the season with a 5–7–2 record, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; tabbed Sayers as &quot;the one bright spot in Chicago&#x27;s pro football year.&quot;

===1967: Shared workload===
In Halas&#x27;s final season as an NFL coach, Sayers again starred. Sharing more of the rushing duties with other backs, such as Brian Piccolo, Sayers gained 880 yards with a 4.7-yard average per carry. His receptions were down as well. He had three kickoff returns for touchdowns on 16 returns, averaging 37.7 yards per return. Only rarely returning punts—he returned three all season—Sayers still managed to return one for a score against the San Francisco 49ers, a game in which he also returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and scored a rushing touchdown on a rain-soaked field in San Francisco&#x27;s Kezar Stadium. &quot;It was a bad field, but it didn&#x27;t stop some people,&quot; said 49ers coach Jack Christiansen of Sayers&#x27; performance. Christiansen said that after Sayers&#x27; kickoff return, he ordered that all punts go out of bounds. But Sayers received the punt and ran 58 yards through the middle of the field for the score. In a November game against the Detroit Lions, a cutback by Sayers caused future hall of fame cornerback Lem Barney to fall over, after which Sayers sprinted for a 63-yard gain. Later in the game he returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. After the season, Sayers was chosen for his third straight Pro Bowl, in which he returned a kickoff 75 yards and scored a three-yard rushing touchdown and again earned player of the game honors. Chicago finished in second place in the newly organized Central Division with a 7–6–1 record.

===1968–1969: Right knee injury and comeback season===
Sayers had the most productive rushing yardage game of his career on November 3, 1968, against the Green Bay Packers, during which he carried 24 times for 205 yards. His season ended prematurely the following week against the 49ers&#x27; Kermit Alexander, when he tore several ligaments in his right knee including his anterior cruciate ligament, his medial collateral ligament, and his meniscus cartilage. Garry Lyle, the teammate nearest Sayers at the time, said, &quot;I saw his eyes sort of glass over. I heard him holler. I knew he was hurt.&quot; Sayers had again been leading the league in rushing yards through the first nine games, and finished the year with 856 yards. After surgery, Sayers went through a physical rehabilitation program with the help of Piccolo, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. Despite missing the Bears&#x27; final five games, he earned first-team All-Pro recognition from several media outlets, including the AP, UPI, and NEA.

In the 1969 season, after a slow start and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers led the league in rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He averaged 4.4 yards per carry and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears&#x27; all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL&#x27;s Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West&#x27;s leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the &quot;Back of the Game&quot;.

===1970–1971: Left knee injury and retirement===

In the 1970 preseason, Sayers suffered a second knee injury, this time bone bruises to his left knee. Attempting to play through the injury in the opening game against the Giants, his production was severely limited. He sat out the next two games and returned in Week 4 against the Vikings, but he was still visibly hampered, most evidently when he was unable to chase down Vikings defensive lineman Alan Page during a 65-yard fumble return. Sayers carried only six times for nine yards before further injuring his knee. He underwent surgery the following week and was deemed out for the remainder of the season. He had carried 23 times for 52 yards to that point. During his off time, Sayers took classes to become a stockbroker and became the first black stockbroker in his company&#x27;s history. He also entered a Paine Webber program for 45 nationwide stockbroker trainees and placed second highest in sales.

After another knee operation and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback in 1971. He was kept out of the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers&#x27; final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later at age 29.

=== Career statistics ===
==Playing style==

Sayers&#x27; ability as a runner in the open field was considered unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. He possessed raw speed and was also highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, likened his running to &quot;ballet&quot; and &quot;poetry&quot;. Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers&#x27; for two seasons, called him &quot;the greatest player I&#x27;ve ever seen. That&#x27;s right—the greatest.&quot; Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers:

He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you could never get a clean shot on Gale. Never.

On his tendency to escape from tight situations, Sayers once proclaimed, &quot;Just give me 18 inches of daylight. That&#x27;s all I need.&quot; He felt if his blockers created 18 inches of space for him to run through, he could break a run into the open field. This quick acceleration became a hallmark of his running style, although some of it was lost following the injury to his right knee. After the injury, he relied more on tough running and engaging tacklers for extra yards.

Despite the production from Sayers, the Bears as a whole struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers&#x27; main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East&#x27;s attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season&#x27;s game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the &quot;Back of the Game&quot;, an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. &quot;The Pro Bowl is the time to prove how good you are, playing against the best of your peers,&quot; recalled Sayers. &quot;I took it as a challenge. I came into the game in shape, came to play.&quot;

==Brian Piccolo==
In 1967, Sayers and Bears teammate Brian Piccolo became roommates in the NFL. Sayers&#x27; ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo&#x27;s struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity) became the subject of the made-for-TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers&#x27; account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, &quot;I Am Third&quot;. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo&#x27;s side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.

==Later life==

===Sports administration and business career===

Sayers worked in the athletic department at his alma mater, the University of Kansas, for three and half years, before he was named the athletic director at Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1976. He resigned from his position at Southern Illinois in 1981. From 1985 to 1986, Sayers worked as the athletic director at Tennessee State University in Nashville, TN.

In 1984, Sayers founded Crest Computer Supply Company in the Chicago area. Under Sayers&#x27; leadership, this company experienced consistent growth and was renamed Sayers 40, Inc. He was chairman of Sayers 40, Inc., the aforementioned technology consulting and implementation firm serving Fortune 1000 companies nationally with offices in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Walpole, Massachusetts, Clearwater, Florida, and Atlanta. Sayers, along with his wife Ardythe, were also active philanthropists in Chicago. He supported the Cradle Foundation—an adoption organization in Evanston, Illinois, and founded the Gale Sayers Center in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. The Gale Sayers Center is an after-school program for children ages 8–12 from Chicago&#x27;s west side and focuses on leadership development, tutoring, and mentoring. In 2009, Sayers joined the University of Kansas Athletic Department staff as Director of Fundraising for Special Projects.

===Concussion lawsuits===
In September 2013, Sayers reportedly sued the NFL, claiming the league negligently handled his repeated head injuries during his career. The lawsuit claimed Sayers suffered headaches and short-term memory loss since retirement. It stated he was sometimes sent back into games after suffering concussions, and that the league did not do enough to protect him. The case was withdrawn after Sayers initially claimed it was done so because the case was filed without his permission, but was actually withdrawn due to other litigation that Sayers was involved in at the time. Sayers filed a new lawsuit in January 2014 along with six other former players. The lawsuit was finally settled in late October, 2017. Sayers was represented by James Acho.

===Legacy and honors===

====Records====
Sayers&#x27; record of 22 touchdowns in a season was broken by O. J. Simpson in 1975, who scored 23; his 22 touchdowns remains a rookie record as of 2021. Sayers was the last player to score at least six touchdowns in a game until 2020, when Alvin Kamara scored six against the Minnesota Vikings. His career kickoff return average of 30.56 yards is an NFL record for players with at least 75 attempts, and he is one of several players to have scored two return touchdowns in a game. He is tied with four other players for the second most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. Sayers&#x27; rookie record of 2,272 all-purpose yards was broken in 1988 by Tim Brown, who gained 2,317 yards through 16 games, which was two more games than Sayers set the record in. His single-season all-purpose yards record of 2,440 set in 1966 was broken in 1974 by Mack Herron, who surpassed it by four yards.

====Post-career recognition====

Sayers was elected to the &quot;Lincoln Journal&quot;&#x27;s Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 1973, the first black athlete to be so honored. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977. His number 48 jersey is one of three retired by the Kansas Jayhawks football team.

Later in 1977, Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of a Monday night game, the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, which is composed of the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1969, Sayers was selected to the NFL 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1994, Sayers was selected for the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 2019, he was one of twelve running backs selected to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked 22nd on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

===Illness and death===
In March 2017, Sayers&#x27; wife, Ardythe, revealed that he had been diagnosed with dementia four years prior. She stated that a Mayo Clinic doctor confirmed it was likely caused by his football career. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t so much getting hit in the head,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s just the shaking of the brain when they took him down with the force they play the game in.&quot; While he remained physically healthy, the disease had an adverse effect on his mental health and memory in particular, making simple tasks such as signing his own name difficult. After suffering from dementia for several years, Sayers died on September 23, 2020, at the age of 77.

<text>The Mitchell Bowl is one of the two semifinal bowls of U Sports football, Canada&#x27;s national competition for university teams that play Canadian football. It is held in the more westerly location of the two semifinal venues. The winner of this game goes on to play against the Uteck Bowl champions for the Vanier Cup. The home of the Mitchell Bowl, as well as the two conference champions, changes each year on a rotating basis. The Mitchell Bowl was named after Douglas H. Mitchell, a former Canadian Football League commissioner and member of the National Hockey League board of governors.

==History==
In 2001, U Sports, then known as CIS, voted to change the permanent site of the Atlantic Bowl in the interest of competitive fairness. In 2002, the Mitchell Bowl was first awarded, replacing the Atlantic Bowl. During 2002, the Mitchell Bowl played opposite to the Churchill Bowl. In 2003, the Uteck Bowl replaced the Churchill Bowl.

The 2020 game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==List of Mitchell Bowl champions==
==Future participants==
The teams and host sites of the Mitchell Bowl and the Uteck Bowl rotate on a six-year cycle, so that in each cycle each of the four conferences hosts and visits every other conference once. With the 2020 game cancelled, the cycle was delayed by one year with the 2020 teams playing in 2021.

The participants and sites for future Mitchell Bowl games are listed below:

All Mitchell Bowl games have been played at the home field of the host conference&#x27;s champion. As of 2024, home teams have a record of 14–9.

<text>Mount Nimrod (officially Mount Nimrod/Kaumira since 2010) is a hill in the Hunters Hills area of Canterbury, New Zealand.

==Naming==
The English name first appears on a map in 1863 but the reason for it being used is unknown. Nimrod was a biblical hunter which has led to speculation. The Hunters Hills are named as they were a significant hunting area for the local Māori at the time of European settlement. Known in the Māori language as Te Tari a Te Kaumira meaning &quot;the long range of Te Kaumira&quot; who perished there in a snowstorm, hence the Māori name for Mount Nimrod.

==Geology==
The uplifted Hunter Hills are built on greywacke basement with overlaying sediments including coal deposits. The uplift is related to the predominantly reverse Hunter Hills fault. The fault zone is not particularly active and has been mapped for , with a slip rate of less than /year, an average displacement at events between that occur more than 10,000 years apart.

==Recreation==

===Hunting===
The western slopes of the mountain are situated in public conservation land with hunting permits being required.

===Mount Nimrod Reserve===
On the mountains north eastern slopes is the Mount Nimrod Reserve northwest of the White Rock River. This is a haven for bird life and contains a waterfall. Access from the reserve to the hunting conservation areas on the far side of the mountain is not possible as the land in between is in private hands.

<text>Fiske Terrace is a planned community and neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Fiske Terrace is located in south central Brooklyn in the southern edge of the community of Flatbush and north of the community of Midwood. It is bounded by Foster Avenue on the north, Ocean Avenue on the east, the Bay Ridge Branch of the Long Island Rail Road/New York and Atlantic Railway right-of-way on the south, and the New York City Subway BMT Brighton Line subway line () on the west.

== Overview ==
Fiske Terrace was developed, along with Midwood Park, with individually designed housing by the T.B. Ackerson Company in 1905; after the T. B. Ackerson Company bought what was then a forest, it was razed within 18 months, giving way to about 150 custom-made houses as well as streets and utilities, and the Midwood Malls. Prominent past residents included Richard Hellmann, creator and founder of &quot;Hellmann&#x27;s Mayonnaise&quot;, and Charles Ebbets, owner of Ebbets Field Baseball Stadium and the Brooklyn Dodgers. On March 18, 2008, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously approved designation of the Fiske Terrace-Midwood Park Historic District. 250 homes were designated. The community is served by the Avenue H (formerly Fiske Terrace) station of the BMT Brighton Line, whose century-old station house is a New York City designated landmark.

<doc id="1160477" wikidata="Q386415" url="?curid=1160477" title="Hironori Ōtsuka">
<text>was a Japanese master of karate who created the Wadō-ryū style of karate. He was the first Grand Master of Wadō-ryū karate, and received high awards within Japan for his contributions to karate.

==Early life==
Ōtsuka was born on June 1, 1892, in Shimodate City, Ibaraki, Japan. He was one of four children to Tokujiro Ōtsuka, a medical doctor. At the age of 5 years, he began training in the martial art of jujutsu under his great-uncle, Chojiro Ebashi (a samurai). Ōtsuka&#x27;s father took over his martial arts education in 1897. At the age of 13, Ōtsuka became the student of Tatsusaburo Nakayama in Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu.

In 1911, while studying business administration at Waseda University in Tokyo, Ōtsuka trained in various jujutsu schools in the area. Before his studies were complete, his father died and he was unable to continue studying; he commenced work as a clerk at the Kawasaki Bank. Although he wished to become a full-time instructor, he did not pursue this course at this point out of respect for his mother&#x27;s wishes.

==Shotokan karate==
On June 1, 1921
, Ōtsuka received the &quot;menkyo kaiden&quot; (certificate of mastery and licence to teach) in Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu from Tatsusaburo Nakayama. While a valid licence, a common misconception is that along with this certificate he became the &quot;4th grandmaster&quot; of Shindō Yōshin-ryū. This is inaccurate – the 3rd grandmaster (Tatsuo Matsuoka) actually outlived Ōtsuka by almost 8 years.

Jujutsu was not to become his primary art, however; in 1922, Ōtsuka began training in Shotokan karate under Gichin Funakoshi, who was a new arrival in Japan. In 1927, he also established a medical practice and specialised in treating martial arts training injuries.

By 1928, Ōtsuka was an assistant instructor in Funakoshi&#x27;s school. He also trained under Chōki Motobu and Kenwa Mabuni, and studied kobudo, around this time. Ōtsuka began to have philosophical disagreements with Funakoshi, and the two men parted ways in the early 1930s. This may have come, in part, from his decision to train with Motobu. Funakoshi&#x27;s karate emphasized &quot;kata&quot;, a series of movements and techniques linked by the fighting principles. Funakoshi did not believe that sparring was necessary for realistic training. Motobu, however, emphasized the necessity of free application, and created a series of two-person &quot;kumite&quot; called &quot;yakusoku kumite&quot;.

==Wado-ryu karate==
On April 1, 1934, Ōtsuka opened his own karate school the Dai Nippon Karate Shinko Kai at 63 Banchi Suehiro-Cho, Kanda, Tokyo. He blended Shotokan karate with his knowledge of Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu to form Wadō-ryū karate, although the art would only later take on this name several years later. With recognition of his style as an independent karate style, Ōtsuka became a full-time instructor. In 1940, his style was registered at the Butokukai, Kyoto, for the demonstration of various martial arts, together with Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, and Gōjū-ryū.

Following World War II, the practice of martial arts in Japan was banned. After a few years, however, the ban was lifted; through the 1950s, Ōtsuka held various karate competitions. In 1964, three of Ōtsuka&#x27;s students Tatsuo Suzuki, Toru Arakawa, and Hajime Takashima) from Nihon University toured Europe and the United States of America, demonstrating Wadō-ryū karate.

==Later life==
On April 29, 1966, Emperor Hirohito awarded Ōtsuka the Order of the Rising Sun, Fifth Class for his contributions to karate. In the next few years, Ōtsuka wrote two books on karate: &quot;Karate-Do, Volume 1&quot; (1967, focused on &quot;kata&quot;) and &quot;Karate-Do, Volume 2&quot; (1970, focused on &quot;kumite&quot;). On October 9, 1972, the Kokusai Budoin International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF Japan) awarded Ōtsuka the title of &quot;Shodai Karate-do Meijin Judan&quot; (first-generation karate master 10th &quot;dan&quot;); this was the first time this honour had been bestowed on a karate practitioner.

On March 22, 1970, Ōtsuka was presented with the key to the City of Niagara Falls, NY. Mayor E. Dent Lackey awarded Ōtsuka with the key to the city which was presented to Ōtsuka by one of his students (Robert Heisner, a Niagara Falls resident) who had recently been promoted to Nidan - Second Dan Black Belt by Ōtsuka.

Ōtsuka continued to teach and lead Wadō-ryū karate into the 1980s, and died on January 29, 1982. In 1983, his son, Jiro Ohtsuka, became the second Grand Master of Wadō-ryū karate and honoured his father by taking the name &quot;Hironori Ōtsuka II.&quot;

==Notes==

a. Ōtsuka&#x27;s surname is sometimes also spelled as Ohtsuka.

<doc id="1160478" wikidata="Q3555576" url="?curid=1160478" title="Thompson shell">
<text>The Thompson shell was the first Unix shell, introduced in the first version of Unix in 1971, and was written by Ken Thompson.
It was a simple command interpreter, not designed for scripting, but nonetheless introduced several innovative features to the command-line interface and led to the development of the later Unix shells.

==History==
The name &quot;shell&quot; for a command-line interpreter and the concept of making the shell a user program outside of the operating system kernel were introduced in Unix&#x27;s precursor Multics.

An early feature of the Thompson shell was a compact syntax for input/output redirection. In Multics, redirecting the input or output of a command required separate commands to start and stop redirection; in Unix, one could simply add an argument to the command line consisting of the &lt; symbol followed by a filename for input or the &gt; symbol for output, and the shell would redirect I/O for the duration of the command. This syntax was already present by the release of the first version of Unix in 1971.

A later addition was the concept of pipes. At the suggestion of Douglas McIlroy, the redirection syntax was expanded so that the output of one command could be passed to the input of another command. The original pipe syntax, as described in the Version 3 manual, was:

 command1 &gt;command2&gt;

This syntax proved too ambiguous and was easily confused with redirection to files—the system cannot tell whether &quot;command2&quot; is a command or a file. By Version 4, the syntax had changed to use both the | and ^ symbols to denote pipes:

 command1 | command2

This produces exactly the same result as:

 command1 ^ command2

The &gt; symbol changed into:

 command1 &gt; file1

This would put the output of command1 into file1.

The Thompson shell syntax for redirection with &lt; and &gt;, and piping with |, has proven durable and has been adopted by most other Unix shells and command shells of several other operating systems, most notably on DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows.

== Design ==
The shell&#x27;s design was intentionally minimalistic; even the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;goto&quot; statements, essential for control of program flow, were implemented as separate commands.

The shell has no facilities for comments besides a builtin command . Programmers simply write text after this command, which ignores all parameters and simply succeeds. Other builtins include , , , , , and .

The &quot;if&quot; command combines the uses of modern-day Bourne shell &quot;test&quot; and &quot;if&quot;. The command first looks for an expression (which can be similar to modern-day &quot;test&quot; or involve an external command) then treats the rest of the command-line as the command to execute if the condition turns out true. There is no &quot;else&quot; branch.

&quot;goto&quot; is implemented in an interesting way, as it is separate from the shell. When asked to jump to &quot;LABEL&quot;, it seeks the current command file for a line that says (recall that is simply ignored), then exits. When the shell tries to read a next line, the repositioned file descriptor will direct it to the labelled location.

There is no redirection of additional file descriptors other than standard input and output (0 and 1) in Thompson shell. Redirection of stderr (file descriptor 2) also requires an external program wrapper, .

The shell supports globbing, but actually implements it by deferring it to a command that replaces the arguments and calls the requested command.

Thompson shell has positional parameters, but no named variables nor access to environmental variables. It understands the creation of background commands with , similar to Bourne shell. It offers quoting and backslash escapes, though the single quotes work differently from Bourne shell.

==Decline and replacements==
As a result of the simplistic design, by the 1975 release of Version 6 Unix, it was becoming clear that the Thompson shell was inadequate for most serious programming tasks.

At this time, the developers of the Programmer&#x27;s Workbench UNIX distribution, most notably John Mashey, began modifying the Thompson shell to make it more suitable for programming.
The result, known as the PWB shell or the Mashey shell, included more advanced flow-control mechanisms and introduced shell variables, but remained limited by the necessity to remain compatible with the Thompson shell.

Finally, the Thompson shell was replaced as the main Unix shell by the Bourne shell in Version 7 Unix and the C shell in 2BSD, both released in 1979. Since virtually all modern Unix and Unix-like systems are descended from V7 and 2BSD, the Thompson shell is generally no longer used. It is, however, available as open-source as part of several Ancient Unix source distributions, and has been ported to modern Unices as a historical exhibit.

<text>Einion Yrth ap Cunedda ( – c. 500; – c. 480), also known as Einion Yrth (Welsh for &quot;the Impetuous&quot;), was a king of Gwynedd. He is claimed as an ancestor of the later rulers of North Wales.

One of the sons of Cunedda, he travelled with his father to North Wales in the early 450s to expel Irish raiders from the region. After his father&#x27;s death, Einion inherited control over the newly founded kingdom of Gwynedd. Aided by his brother Ceredig, ruler of Ceredigion, and his nephew Meirion, ruler of Meirionnydd, Einion built upon his father&#x27;s successes and further established his family&#x27;s rule in the region. He was succeeded by two sons: Cadwallon Lawhir and Owain Danwyn.

<text>The Deepwater Railway was an intrastate short line railroad located in West Virginia in the United States which operated from 1898 to 1907.

William N. Page, a civil engineer and entrepreneur, had begun a small logging railroad in Fayette County in 1896, sometimes called the Loup Creek and Deepwater Railway. It extended from an interchange at Deep Water with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) on the south bank of the navigable Kanawha River up a steep grade into the mountainous terrain southward, following the winding Loup Creek to reach a sawmill at Robson which was owned by the Loup Creek Estate. It was operated by the C&amp;O under a verbal agreement.

In 1898, the Deepwater Railway was incorporated, and an extension was planned to reach nearby coal deposits at Page. In 1902, assisted by silent partner, millionaire industrialist Henry H. Rogers of Standard Oil fame, Page expanded his plans, first to extend further in West Virginia to Matoaka. In 1907, the Deepwater Railway was acquired by its sister Tidewater Railway to form the Virginian Railway.

<doc id="1160484" wikidata="Q1134367" url="?curid=1160484" title="Phrase structure grammar">
<text>The term phrase structure grammar was originally introduced by Noam Chomsky as the term for grammar studied previously by Emil Post and Axel Thue (Post canonical systems). Some authors, however, reserve the term for more restricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy: context-sensitive grammars or context-free grammars. In a broader sense, phrase structure grammars are also known as &quot;constituency grammars&quot;. The defining character of phrase structure grammars is thus their adherence to the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation of dependency grammars.

== History ==
In 1956, Chomsky wrote, &quot;A phrase-structure grammar is defined by a finite vocabulary (alphabet) Vp, and a finite set Σ of initial strings in Vp, and a finite set F of rules of the form: X → Y, where X and Y are strings in Vp.&quot;

==Constituency relation==
In linguistics, phrase structure grammars are all those grammars that are based on the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation associated with dependency grammars; hence, phrase structure grammars are also known as constituency grammars. Any of several related theories for the parsing of natural language qualify as constituency grammars, and most of them have been developed from Chomsky&#x27;s work, including

* Government and binding theory
* Generalized phrase structure grammar
* Head-driven phrase structure grammar
* Lexical functional grammar
* The minimalist program
* Nanosyntax

Further grammar frameworks and formalisms also qualify as constituency-based, although they may not think of themselves as having spawned from Chomsky&#x27;s work, e.g.

* Arc pair grammar, and
* Categorial grammar.

<text>The Lenin Prize (, ) was one of the most prestigious awards of the Soviet Union for accomplishments relating to science, literature, arts, architecture, and technology. It was originally created on June 23, 1925, and awarded until 1934. During the period from 1935 to 1956, the Lenin Prize was not awarded, being replaced largely by the Stalin Prize. On August 15, 1956, it was reestablished, and continued to be awarded on every even-numbered year until 1990. The award ceremony was April 22, Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s birthday.

The Lenin Prize is different from the Lenin Peace Prize, which was awarded to foreign citizens rather than to citizens of the Soviet Union, for their contributions to the peace cause. Also, the Lenin Prize should not be confused with the Stalin Prize or the later USSR State Prize. Some persons were awarded both the Lenin Prize and the USSR State Prize.

On April 23, 2018, the head of the Ulyanovsk Oblast, Sergey Morozov, reintroduced the Lenin Prize for achievements in the humanities, literature, and art to coincide with the 150th birthday of Lenin in 2020.

<text>Joseph Francis Joy (September 13, 1883 – February 1957) was born in the small mining town of Cumberland, Maryland. Joy is known for being an inventor. He accumulated 190 patents in his lifetime.

His major inventions were the first continuous mining machines recognized as milestones in the history of underground mining mechanization. He had pioneered new concepts in hydraulics, modern control and power circuits, trackless mining equipment, efficient gearing and seal designs as well as dozens of other &quot;firsts&quot; in the industry. His mining machines changed forever the way minerals are mined dramatically improving production. Many of his machines are still in use today. 

Joy is also known for founding the company that bears his name in Franklin Pennsylvania: Joy Mining Machinery.

<doc id="1160492" wikidata="Q2999382" url="?curid=1160492" title="Uteck Bowl">
<text>The Uteck Bowl is one of the two semifinal bowls of U Sports football, Canada&#x27;s national competition for university teams that play Canadian football. It is held in the easternmost of the two semifinal venues. The Uteck Bowl champion moves on to face the Mitchell Bowl champion for the Vanier Cup. It was named for Larry Uteck, a former professional football player and university coach who died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2002.

==History==
The Atlantic Bowl traditionally saw the Atlantic University Sport champions face a champion from another conference at Huskies Stadium in Halifax. However, in the interests of competitive fairness, the Atlantic Bowl was replaced by the Mitchell Bowl, its venue, like the Churchill Bowl that had paralleled it for so long, rotating among two of the conference champions.

Larry Uteck was a longtime football coach at Saint Mary&#x27;s University and, at the time, the university&#x27;s athletic director. It was decided that the Churchill Bowl would be retired, the Mitchell Bowl would take the place of the Churchill Bowl, and a new championship would be named in Uteck&#x27;s memory. Thus, the Uteck Bowl formally replaced the Atlantic Bowl.

The inaugural Uteck Bowl was played at Huskies Stadium, where two-time defending Vanier Cup champions and home team Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies defeated the Simon Fraser Clan.

The 2020 game was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Uteck Bowl champions==
==Future participants==
The teams and host sites of the Uteck Bowl and the Mitchell Bowl rotate on a six-year cycle, so that in each cycle each of the four conferences hosts and visits every other conference once. With the 2020 game cancelled, the cycle was delayed by one year with the 2020 teams playing in 2021.

The participants and sites for future Uteck Bowl games are listed below:

To date, the Uteck Bowl games hosted by Quebec have been played at the champion&#x27;s home field, while the first four games hosted by Atlantic University Sport (AUS) were played at Huskies Stadium in Halifax. The 2011 game was held in Moncton at the newly built Moncton Stadium. All subsequent games were hosted by the Loney Bowl champion. As of 2023, home teams have a record of 11–9.
