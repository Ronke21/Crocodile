<text>Confession (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ), or My Confession, is a short work on the subject of melancholia, philosophy and religion by the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy. It was written in 1879 to 1880, when Tolstoy was in his early fifties.

== Content ==
The book is a brief autobiographical story of the author&#x27;s struggle with a mid-life existential crisis. It describes his search for the answer to the ultimate philosophical question: &quot;If God does not exist, since death is inevitable, what is the meaning of life?&quot; Without the answer to this, for him, life had become &quot;impossible&quot;.

The story begins with the Eastern fable of the dragon in the well. A man is chased by a beast into a well, at the bottom of which is a dragon. The man clings to a branch inside the well that is being gnawed on by two mice (one black, one white, representing night and day and the relentless march of time). In this hopeless situation the man looks for and finds a few drops of honey which stick to a leaf on his branch. In the original fable the man drinks them and delights. Tolstoy on the other hand is no longer able to enjoy that which these drops represent for him: The love of his family and his writing. The certainty of death drains any joy out of his life.

Tolstoy goes on to describe four possible attitudes towards this dilemma. The first is ignorance. If one is oblivious to the fact that death is approaching, life becomes bearable. The problem with this for him personally is that he is &quot;not&quot; ignorant. Having become conscious of the reality of death, there is no going back.

The second possibility is what Tolstoy describes as Epicureanism. Being fully aware that life is ephemeral, one can enjoy the time one has. Tolstoy&#x27;s problem with this is essentially moral. He states that Epicureanism may work fine and well for the minority who can afford to live &quot;the good life,&quot; but one would have to be morally empty to be able to ignore the fact that the vast majority of people do not have access to the wealth necessary to live this kind of life.

Tolstoy next states that the most intellectually honest response to the situation would be suicide. In the face of the inevitability of death and assuming that God does not exist, why wait? Why pretend that this vale of tears means anything when one can just cut to the chase? For himself, however, Tolstoy writes that he is &quot;too cowardly&quot; to follow through on this most &quot;logically consistent&quot; response.

Finally, Tolstoy says that the fourth option, the one he is taking, is the one of just holding on; living &quot;despite the absurdity of it,&quot; because he is not willing &quot;or able&quot; to do anything else. So it seems &quot;utterly hopeless&quot; - at least &quot;without God&quot;.

So Tolstoy turns to the question of God&#x27;s existence: After despairing of his attempts to find answers in classic philosophical arguments for the existence of God (e.g. the Cosmological Argument, which reasons that God must exist based on the need to ascribe an original cause to the universe), Tolstoy turns to a more mystical, intuitive affirmation of God&#x27;s presence. He states that as soon as he said &quot;God is Life,&quot; life was once again suffused with meaning. Tolstoy&#x27;s original title for this work indicates as much, and his own personal &quot;conversion&quot; is suggested by an epilogue that describes a dream he had some time after completing the body of the text, confirming that he had undergone a radical personal and spiritual transformation.

== History ==

The book was originally titled An Introduction to a Criticism of Dogmatic Theology, as the first part of a four-part work that also included &quot;A Criticism of Dogmatic Theology&quot;, &quot;The Four Gospels Harmonized and Translated&quot; (the basis for &quot;The Gospel in Brief&quot;), and &quot;What I Believe&quot; (also published in English as &quot;My Religion&quot; and &quot;My Faith&quot;).

The first attempt at its publication took place in 1882 (&quot;Russkaya Mysl&quot;, No 5), but Tolstoy&#x27;s work was removed virtually from the whole edition of the journal (i.e. periodical magazine) by Eastern Orthodox Church censorship. The text was later published in Geneva (1884), and in Russia as late as 1906 (&quot;Vsemirnyj Vestnik&quot;, No 1).

The book is discussed at length and quoted from in William James&#x27; &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; and also in Maurice O&#x27;Connor Drury&#x27;s &quot;The Danger of Words&quot;.

<doc id="1187083" wikidata="Q1768028" url="?curid=1187083" title="Balanoglossus">
<text>Balanoglossus is a genus of ocean-dwelling acorn worms. It has zoological importance because, being hemichordates, they are an &quot;evolutionary link&quot; between invertebrates and vertebrates. &quot;Balanoglossus&quot; specimens are deuterostomes, and resemble the chordates in that they possess branchial openings. 

Their heads are between 2.5 mm (1/10 in) and 5 mm (1/5 in) wide.

==Discovery==
Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz discovered &quot;Balanoglossus&quot; in 1825 on Mashail Island, and described it as a worm-like holothurian. The discovery of gill slits in these animals by Alexander Kovalevsky (1865) led to the creation of the class Enteropneusta by Carl Gegenbaur (1870).

==Classification==
William Bateson (1885) originally included them in phylum Chordata. Hyman (1959), however, placed them near Echinodermata and gave Hemichordata a status of an independent phylum.

==Habitat==

&quot;Balanoglossus&quot; are burrowing, exclusively marine animals. They are found in shallow waters between tide marks along the coast of warm and temperate oceans.

==Species==
The World Register of Marine Species lists the following species:
* &quot;Balanoglossus apertus&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus aurantiaca&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus australiensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus biminiensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus borealis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus capensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus carnosus&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus clavigerus&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus gigas&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus hydrocephalus&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus jamaicensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus misakiensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus natalensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus numeensis&quot; 
* &quot;Balanoglossus occidentalis&quot;

<doc id="1187088" wikidata="Q422033" url="?curid=1187088" title="Islam in Egypt">
<text>Islam is the dominant religion in Egypt, with approximately 90% of Egyptians identifying as Muslims. The majority of Egyptian Muslims are adherents of Sunni Islam,&lt;ref name=&quot;The world factbook/Egypt/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while a small minority adhere to Shia Islam. Since 1980, Islam has served as Egypt&#x27;s state religion. Due to the lack of a religious census, owing to the alleged undercounting of non-Muslim minorities in Egyptian censuses, the actual percentage of Muslims is unknown; the percentage of Egyptian Christians, who are the second-largest religious group in the country, is estimated to be between 5% and 10% of the population.

A study at the University of Kent, citing a 2018 survey by Arab Barometer, stated that around 11% of Egyptians identified themselves as not religious. While in the same 2018 Wave survey, 47.2% of Egyptians said they were religious, 39.8% said they were somewhat religious and 10.4% said they were not religious. In the same Arab Barometer 2018 Wave V survey it was reported that, 90.4% said they were Muslim, 9.6% said they were Christian, and 0.1% said they had no religion.

Prior to the French campaign in Egypt and Syria under Napoleon Bonaparte, almost all of Egypt&#x27;s educational, legal, public health, and social welfare issues were in the hands of religious functionaries. Under the Ottoman Empire, the public and political roles of the (i.e., Muslim religious scholars) were reinforced, in an effective continuation of the policies of the Mamluk Sultanate. Traditionally, political divisions in the country were based on religious divisions. During the 19th and 20th centuries, successive governments made extensive efforts to limit the role of the in public life, and religious institutions were increasingly brought under closer levels of state control.

After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the new government assumed responsibility for appointing officials to mosques and Islamic schools. Likewise, it mandated the reform of Al-Azhar University, beginning in 1961. These policies permitted department heads to be drawn from outside the ranks of the traditionally-trained orthodox .

==History==
===Arab caliphate===
In the 7th century, Egypt was invaded and
conquered by the Islamic caliphate by the Muslim Arabs. When they defeated the armies of Byzantine Empire in Egypt, the Arabs brought Islam to the country.
In 639 an army of some 4,000 men were sent to Egypt by the second Rashidun caliph, Umar, under the command of Amr ibn al-As. This army was joined by another 5,000 men in 640 and defeated a Byzantine army at the battle of Heliopolis. Amr next proceeded in the direction of Alexandria, which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on 8 November 641. Alexandria was regained for the Byzantine Empire in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by Constans II was repulsed. From that time no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country.
The Arabs founded the capital of Egypt called Fustat, which was later burned down during the Crusades. Cairo was later built in the year 986 to grow to become the largest and richest city in the Arab caliphate, and one of the biggest and richest in the world.

The Abbasid period was marked by new taxations, and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule. At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under Abdallah ibn Tahir, who decided to reside at Baghdad, sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him. In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out, and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government. Eventually the power loss of the Abbasids in Baghdad has led for general upon general to take over rule of Egypt, yet being under Abbasid allegiance, the Tulunid dynasty (868–905) and Ikhshidid dynasty (935–969) were among the most successful to defy the Abbasid Caliph.

=== The Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks ===
Muslim rulers remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries, with Cairo as the seat of the Fatimid Caliphate. With the end of the Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluks, a Turco-Circassian military caste, took control about 1250. By the late 13th century, Egypt linked the Red Sea, India, Malaya, and East Indies. The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 40% of the country&#x27;s population.
In the late 10th century, the Shia Ismaili caliphate of the Fatimids made Egypt their centre and Cairo their capital. Egypt flourished and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song dynasty, which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages. Many traces of Fatimid architecture exist in Cairo today, the most defining examples include the Al Azhar University and the Al Hakim mosque. The Fatimid palace in Cairo had two parts. It stood in the Khan el-Khalili area on Bin El-Qasryn street.

In the early 20th century, Egyptian Islam was a complex and diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith&#x27;s basic tenets, the country&#x27;s various social groups and classes applied Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar University generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a private matter for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.

===Islam and state===
Muhammad Ali, who assumed power in Egypt in the early 1800s, nationalized all land, including hundreds of thousands of hectares of land belonging to Al Azhar Mosque, putting the funding of that institution under state control. This put an end to the political independence of the Ulama. Awqaf, traditionally independent endowments for mosques and Islamic schools, became a ministry of the government. In 1961, Gamal Abdel Nasser made Al Azhar part of the Ministry of Awqaf or Religious Endowments. He also made the appointment of the grand sheikh the prerogative of the Egyptian president, just as the appointment of any other state official. In time, the school became responsible for assigning imams to all major mosques, and all these imams were required to be graduates of the school.

===Ulama===
Orthodox ulama or &quot;the religious establishment&quot; found themselves in a difficult position during the wave of Islamic activism that swept through Egypt in the 1970s and 1980s. Most Ulama, including those of Al-Azhar University, are employees of the Egyptian state who &quot;recognize the regime’s primacy, support its stability, and legitimize its policies&quot;. Radical Islamists viewed them as puppets of the status quo. To maintain their influence in the country, the ulama espoused more conservative stances. After 1974, for example, many al-Azhar ulama, who had acquiesced to family planning initiatives in the 1960s, openly criticized government efforts at population control. The ulama also supported moves to reform the country&#x27;s legal code to conform to Islamic teaching. They remained, nonetheless, comparatively moderate; they were largely loyal to the government and condemned the violence of radical Islamist groups. Outside of the state-mosques are more than 40,000 independent mosques throughout Egypt.

==Beliefs==
===Contemporary belief===

Egyptian Muslims believe that Islam defines one&#x27;s relationship to God, to other Muslims, and to non-Muslims. Some devout Muslims believe that there can be no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular. Many Muslims say that Egypt&#x27;s governments have been secularist and even anti-religious since the early 1920s. Politically organized Muslims who seek to purge the country of its secular policies are referred to as &quot;Islamists&quot;.

Egypt&#x27;s largely uneducated urban and rural lower classes are intensely devoted to Islam, but they usually lack a thorough knowledge of the religion. Even village religious leaders usually have only a rudimentary knowledge of Islam. The typical village imam or prayer leader has at most a few years of schooling; his scholarly work was limited to reading prayers and sermons prepared by others and to learning passages from the Qur&#x27;an. Popular religion include a variety of unorthodox practices, such as veneration of saints, recourse to charms and amulets, and belief in the influence of evil spirits.
Popular Islam is based mostly on oral tradition. Imams with virtually no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur&#x27;an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual&#x27;s rites of passage. Predestination plays an important role in popular Islam. This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the Qur&#x27;an form the basis of Monotheism merged with a belief in angels, jinn and afarit (spirits).

Popular Islam ranges from informal prayer sessions or Qur&#x27;an study to organized cults or orders. Because of the pervasive sexual segregation of Egypt&#x27;s Islamic society, men and women often practice their religion in different ways. A specifically female religious custom is the Zār, a ceremony for helping women placate spirits who are believed to have possessed them. Women specially trained by their mothers or other women in zar lore organize the ceremonies. A zar organizer holds weekly meetings and employs music and dance to induce ecstatic trances in possessed women. Wealthy women sometimes pay to have private zars conducted in their homes; these zars are more elaborate than public ones, last for several days, and sometimes involve efforts to exorcise spirits. However, while once common, the zar is rarely practiced today, under fire for its perception as a religious heresy.

There are more than 45 million citizens 35 years old or younger. The Influence of digital/youth culture is found in preachers such as the very popular Amr Khaled who &quot;maintains a disciplined focus on the lives, issues and problems of the upper middle classes&quot;; espouses &quot;living a comfortable life&quot;; talks to youth about &quot;getting closer to God&quot; without changing one&#x27;s lifestyle; promotes hijab while &quot;joking about dating and flirting&quot;. The young &quot;sheikhs&quot; deliver their sermons over the Internet, on private satellite channels and in sports clubs, away from the control of Al-Azhar and the state.

===Sufism===
A primarily male spiritual manifestation of Islam is Sufism, an Islamic mystical tradition. It has been called the &quot;default setting&quot; of Muslim religious life in Egypt although many Sufis are thought to have voted for the Muslim Brotherhood Freedom and Justice Party.

Sufism exists in a number of forms, most of which represent an original &quot;tarika&quot; (&quot;path&quot;) developed by an inspired founder, or sheikh. These sheikhs gradually gathered about themselves murids, or disciples, whom they initiated into the tarika. Gradually the murids formed orders, also known as turuq, which were loyal to the Sheikh or his successors (also called sheikhs). In Egypt there are 74 Sufi orders (tarikas), each headed by its own sheikh. Overseeing them is the Supreme Council for Sufi Orders and the president of Egypt is directly in charge of Sufi affairs.

The devotions of many Sufi orders center on various forms of the dhikr, a ceremony at which music, body movements, and chants induce a state of ecstatic trance in the disciples. Since the early 1970s, there has been a revival of interest in Sufism. Egypt&#x27;s contemporary Sufis tend to be young, college-educated men in professional careers.

Estimates of the number of Sufis in Egypt include at least a third of the adult male Muslim population in Egypt, being members of a Sufi order; fifteen million of the country&#x27;s roughly 80 million citizens &quot;claim&quot; Sufism &quot;as a practice&quot;, still others say that while 15 million are registered as Sufis, &quot;the true figure is likely to be higher&quot;. Participation at the festivals (moulids) the Sufi orders organize, is perhaps twice that (and includes women and children). The moulids are a major manifestation of Sufi Islam in Egypt, and are held in honor of holy men and women (In Egypt the term Moulid is not reserved for Muslim festivals and may be in honor of Christian, and until recently Jewish holy men). Sufi Muslim moulids not only venerate the prophet Muhammad and his descendants (such as Hussein, the second son of the fourth Caliph Ali whose moulid in Cairo can draws crowds of more than a million people), but founders of Sufi orders, down to dozens of lesser-known sheikhs celebrated mostly in remote rural communities. The largest moulid in Egypt takes place in Tanta, which draws an even larger number of pilgrims than hajj in Mecca. As many as three million Egyptians and other Arabs gather there every October to celebrate the life of Sayid Ahmad al-Badawi, a thirteenth-century Sufi leader. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic charity), there are officially more than forty such annual commemorations, and the Sufi Council in Egypt lists eighty other festivals for lesser-known founders of Sufi orders.

According to a report issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 
Egypt&#x27;s Islamic religious establishment is strongly Sufi in character. Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the al-Azhar mosque and university system. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. The current Shaykh al-Azhar (rector of the school), Ahmed el-Tayeb, is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the current Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar Ali Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.

===Salafi===
An estimated 5–6 million Egyptians are Salafis. Scholar Tarek Osman describes Salafis before the 2011 revolution as the &quot;most important or pervasive Islamic force in the country&quot; with an influence &quot;many times more than that of organized political Islam.&quot; With &quot;no history of violence, no organizational structure, no manifestos and no obvious political ambitions&quot;, they were tolerated by the Mubarak regime and ignored by the news media. The Salafi movement benefited from government support the 1990s when the government hoped to &quot;combat and undermine&quot; the violence of the Jihadi Salafi al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya with the preaching of the apolitical Salafis. It has also benefited from some of the $70 billion spent by Saudi Arabia to promote &quot;Wahhabi&quot; ideology worldwide through mosques, schools and books, that is similar or &quot;virtually identical to Salafi beliefs and with which Sufis have had difficulty competing.&quot;

During the Mubarak era most Salafis considered participation in politics to be &quot;religiously forbidden&quot;, however since then Salafis have shown themselves to be not only tolerant of political participation but very adept. In the 2011–12 Egypt parliamentary elections, the Islamist Bloc led by salafi Al-Nour Party received 27.8% of votes cast or 127 of the 498 parliamentary seats contested, second-place after the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party. Al‑Nour party itself won 111 of the 127 seats.

Sufi Islam is a sore point with Salafi Muslims. Salafi and other Islamists believe Sufi tombs are unIslamic and have sometimes sabotaged or vandalized tombs and moulids.

===Quranism===
Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in Egypt. During the early 20th century, the ideas of Egyptian Quranists like Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi (1881–1920) are thought to have grown out of Salafism – specifically a rejection of taqlid. Notable Egyptian Quranists include Sidqi, Rashad Khalifa, Ahmed Subhy Mansour, and Tawfik Hamid.

===Shia===

While almost all of Egypt&#x27;s Muslims are Sunni, there are a small number of Shia. (Estimates of their number range from 800,000 to &quot;at most&quot; three million.) The Syrian civil war has brought on an increase in anti-Shia rhetoric by Sunnis, harassment and arrest, and in at least one case bloodshed. In June 2013 a mob of several hundred, including Muslim brotherhood members, attacked a house in the village of Abu Musallim near Cairo, dragging four Shia worshipers through the street before lynching them. Eight other Shia were injured.

===Ahmadiyya===

The Ahmadiyya movement in Egypt, which numbers up to 50,000 adherents in the country, was established in 1922 but has seen an increase in hostility and government repression as of the 21st century. The Al-Azhar University has denounced the Ahmadis and Ahmadis have been hounded by police along with other Muslim groups deemed to be deviant under Egypt&#x27;s defamation laws. On 15 March 2010, nine Ahmadis were detained due to their adherence to the movement.

===Nondenominational Muslims===
There are a significant amount of Nondenominational Muslims in Egypt. Roughly twelve percent of Egyptians, when asked about their religious affiliation, answered that they were &quot;just a Muslim&quot; or &quot;just Muslim&quot;. Their lack of identifying with a particular sect was noteworthy. Besides Kosovo, Egypt has had the largest positive net change of Muslims identifying as non-denominational Muslims. Roughly five percent of Egyptian Muslims who were raised in a different affiliation began identifying as non-denominational Muslims as adults.

==State involvement==
The Ministry of Awqaf or Religious Endowments, oversees mosques in Egypt. There are more than 110,000 mosques registered with the state in Egypt. The ministry assigns ulama to registered mosques, which critics complain inevitably involves favoritism and political connections.

In the wake of the 2013 coup the state imposed tighter controls on mosques. The Awqaf Ministry command the mosques be locked between prayer times and took control of donation boxes. In September 2013 it declared that only imams who had graduated from Al Azhar University (estimated at 58,000) would be allowed to hold Friday sermons. This effectively banned an estimated 53,000 imams from preaching in mosques, although it is not clear if this edict can be enforced. In 2015, the Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments initiated a campaign to remove any books authored by Salafi scholars from all mosques in Egypt.

Critics have complained that the actions of Awqaf reflect the government that controls them. Mahmoud Zakzouk, Minister of Awqaf from 1995 to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, was appointed by Mubarak and dismissed at his overthrow. Under the Mohamed Morsi government, critics alleged the Muslim Brotherhood put &quot;its allies in high positions&quot;. And under the post-coup government the new Awqaf minister is reportedly &quot;quietly purging all Brotherhood appointees&quot;.

==Clothing==

The hijab became more unpopular with educated women, including devout Muslims, in the early 20th century as the British authorities discouraged it and as women sought to gain modern positions of power. The hijab became more popular in the 1970s, with women choosing to adopt it.

In 2012, Misr International films was producing a television series based on the novel &quot;Zaat&quot; by Sonallah Ibrahim. Filming of scenes set at Ain Shams University was scheduled to occur that year, but Muslim Brotherhood student members and some teachers at the school protested, stating that the 1970s era clothing worn by the actresses was indecent and would not allow filming unless the clothing was changed. Gaby Khoury, the head of the film company, stated that engineering department head Sherif Hammad &quot;insisted that the filming should stop and that we would be reimbursed ... explaining that he was not able to guarantee the protection of the materials or the artists.&quot;

==Islamic political movements==

Islamic political activism has a lengthy history in Egypt. Several Islamic political groups started soon after World War I ended. The most well-known Islamic political organization is the Muslim Brotherhood (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, also known as the Brotherhood), founded in 1928 by Hassan al Banna. After World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood acquired a reputation as a radical group prepared to use violence to achieve its religious goals. The group was implicated in several assassinations, including the murder of one prime minister. The Brotherhood had contacts with the Free Officers before the 1952 Revolution and supported most of their initial policies. The Brotherhood, however, soon came into conflict with Gamal Abdel Nasser. The government accused the Brotherhood of complicity in an alleged 1954 plot to assassinate the president and imprisoned many of the group&#x27;s leaders. In the 1970s, Anwar Sadat amnestied the leaders and permitted them to resume some of their activities. But by that time, the Brotherhood was divided into at least three factions. The more militant faction was committed to a policy of political opposition to the government. A second faction advocated peaceful withdrawal from society and the creation, to the extent possible, of a separate, parallel society based upon Islamic values and law. The dominant moderate group advocated cooperation with the regime.

The Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s reemergence as a political force coincided with the proliferation of Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt&#x27;s defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 Six-Day War was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism. Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to their vision of a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, incumbent on believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted jihad and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, Islamists perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of Anwar Sadat in October 1981.
Disruptive social changes and Sadat&#x27;s relative tolerance toward political parties contributed to the rapid growth of Islamic groups in the 1970s. On university campuses, for example, Sadat initially viewed the rise of Islamic associations (Gama&#x27;at Islamiya) as a counterbalance to leftist influence among students. The Gama&#x27;at Islamiya spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the segregation of classes by gender. Secular university administrators opposed these goals. In 1979 Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At Asyut University, which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, secularists, and Copts), the president and other top administrators—who were Islamists—supported Gama&#x27;at Islamiya demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment. Public opinion in Egypt supported political Islam to some extent, one poll in the mid-1980s found 96% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the application of the Sharia.

, the Islamists sought to make Egypt a community of the faithful based on their vision of an Islamic social order. They rejected conventional, secularist social analyses of Egypt&#x27;s socioeconomic problems. They maintained, for example, that the causes of poverty were not overpopulation or high defense expenditures but the populace&#x27;s spiritual failures—laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life. The Islamists created their own alternative network of social and economic institutions through which members could work, study, and receive medical treatment in an Islamic environment.

Islamists rejected Marxism and Western capitalism. Indeed, they viewed atheistic communism, Jewish Zionism, and Western &quot;Crusader-minded&quot; Christianity as their main enemies, which were responsible for the decadence that led to foreign domination and defeat by Zionists. They were intolerant of people who did not share their worldview. Islamists tended to be hostile toward the orthodox ulama, especially the scholars at Al Azhar who frequently criticized the Islamists&#x27; extreme religious interpretations. Islamists believed that the established social and political order had tainted the ulama, who had come to represent stumbling blocks to the new Islamic order. In addition, Islamists condemned the orthodox as &quot;pulpit parrots&quot; committed to a formalist practice of Islam but not to its spirit.

The social origins of Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed primarily to urban civil servants and white and blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from a broad spectrum of social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose fathers were middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study—medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy—were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the lower-middle class, and the urban working class.

Various Islamist groups espoused different means for achieving their political agenda. All Islamists, however, were concerned with Islam&#x27;s role in the complex and changing society of Egypt in the late twentieth century. A common focus of their political efforts has been to incorporate the Shari&#x27;a into the country&#x27;s legal code. In deference to their increasing influence, the Ministry of Justice in 1977 published a draft law making apostasy by a Muslim a capital offense and proposing traditional Islamic punishments for crimes, such as stoning for adultery and amputation of a hand for theft. In 1980 Egypt supported a referendum that proposed a constitutional amendment to make the Shari&#x27;a &quot;the sole source of law.&quot; The influence of the Islamists temporarily waned in the aftermath of Sadat&#x27;s assassination in 1981, but the election of nine members of the Muslim Brotherhood to the People&#x27;s Assembly in 1984 revived Islamists&#x27; prospects. In 1985 the People&#x27;s Assembly voted to initiate a procedure for the gradual application of the Shari&#x27;a, beginning with an indefinite education period to prepare the population for the legal changes; the next step would be to amend all existing laws to exclude any provisions that conflict with the Shari&#x27;a. Moves to reform the legal code received support from many Muslims who wanted to purify society and reject Western legal codes forced on Egypt in the 19th and 20th centuries. As of 2009, the Grand Mufti also has another title, Dar al-Iftaa, a part of the Ministry of Justice. While his rulings are nonbinding, they are &quot;influential.&quot; His office issues 5,000 fatwas a week.

By the beginning of the 21st century, only the Gama&#x27;at Islamiya leaders who were in prison after the assassination of Sadat were released after several books they wrote and interviews showed that they revised their points of view and changed the radical tone of their speeches.

==Status of religious freedom==


The Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the practice of religion; however, the Government places restrictions on this right. According to the Constitution, Islam is the official state religion, and Shari&#x27;a is the primary source of legislation; religious practices that conflict with the official interpretation of Shari&#x27;a are prohibited. However, since the Government does not consider the practice of Christianity or Judaism to conflict with Shari&#x27;a, for the most part members of the non-Muslim minority worship without legal harassment and may maintain links with coreligionists in other countries. Members of other religions that are not recognized by the Government, such as the Baháʼí Faith, may experience personal and collective hardship.

An 1856 Ottoman decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain a presidential decree to build a place of worship. In addition Interior Ministry regulations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Government must consider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construction of a church. These conditions include the location of the proposed site, the religious composition of the surrounding community, and the proximity of other churches. The Ottoman decree also requires the President to approve permits for the repair of church facilities.

In December 1999, in response to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, President Mubarak issued a decree making the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code. The decree is significant symbolically because it places churches closer to an equal footing with mosques before the law. The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities&#x27; approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time-consuming and insufficiently responsive to the wishes of the Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.

According to a 1995 law, the application of family law, including marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody, inheritance, and burial, is based on an individual&#x27;s religion. In the practice of family law, the State recognizes only the three &quot;heavenly religions&quot;: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Muslim families are subject to the Personal Status Law, which draws on Shari&#x27;a (Islamic law). Christian families are subject to canon law, and Jewish families are subject to Jewish law. In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man, the courts apply the Personal Status Law.

Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir&#x27;s inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents&#x27; estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents&#x27; property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it easier for a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband&#x27;s consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony and the return of her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law that would have made it easier for a woman to travel without her husband&#x27;s consent, was rejected. Although later in 2000, after a court ruling, Egyptian women were given the right to apply for a passport and travel without the husband&#x27;s consent.

<text>Merritt College is a public community college in Oakland, California, United States. Merritt, like the other three campuses of the Peralta Community College District, is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges. The college enrolls approximately 6,000 students.

==History==

Merritt College (named for physician Samuel Merritt) was opened as a general campus in 1954. Merritt College was originally located on Grove Street in North Oakland but later moved to Campus Drive in the hills of East Oakland.

===Grove Street===

The original Merritt College was located at what is now 5714 Martin Luther King Jr. Way (then called Grove Street) in the flatlands of North Oakland. In 1923, the campus of University High School was built for children of faculty of the University of California in Berkeley. The campus closed during World War II, but was reopened as the Merritt School of Business in 1946. In 1954, the Oakland Unified School District, then operating the Merritt campus and the Laney Trade and Technical School, formed Oakland Junior College (later renamed Oakland City College). In 1960, the same year as the opening of Skyline High School, OUSD decided to relocate Merritt College from Grove Street to the hills of East Oakland.

Although the demographics of North Oakland changed throughout the 1950s and 1960s, it was not until the mid-to-late-1960s that the student and faculty population began to change. After the 1960 California Master Plan for Public Higher Education, more Black students began to attend Merritt. In the early 1960s, the Afro-American Association began recruiting Merritt students. By 1964, students formed the Soul Students Advisory Council, predecessors to the Black Student Union (BSU). Merritt Community College was the meeting place for prominent leaders of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton. The two met in September 1962 and shortly after began organizing the Black Panther Party. There were many public displays of unrest on the campus during this time, speaking to the Cuban blockade, the black experience, and other political topics. The two leaders also attended many politically charged classes at the school such as experimental sociology, Black History, and Negro History. This occurred in September 1966 and started as Huey and Bobby brainstorming a ten-point platform. As the two grew closer, they first became involved in local organizations in Oakland only to eventually create their own.

Against numerous protests by students and community members, Merritt was relocated from Grove Street to the hills of East Oakland in 1971. Merritt was renamed North Peralta Community College but was commonly known as Grove Street College. In 1975, a judge ordered the physical plant closed for seismic issues. The Grove Street campus was used as the primary filming location for the 1987 film, &quot;The Principal.&quot;

This site, now rehabilitated and serving as the north campus of the Children&#x27;s Hospital and Research Center Oakland, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

===Campus Drive===

The present campus was opened in 1971. Funding came primarily as a result of a 1965 bond issue which also established a new downtown Oakland (&quot;Civic Center&quot;) campus building for Laney College and the founding of the College of Alameda.

==Occupational programs==

Merritt College&#x27;s occupational programs include nursing and health professions, community social services/substance abuse counseling, environmental management and technology, cybersecurity, computer information systems, landscape horticulture and environmental management, paralegal studies, real estate and restoration technology. A one-year Microscopy Certificate is also offered.

<text>Photokina is a trade fair held in Europe for the photographic and imaging industries. It is the world&#x27;s largest such trade fair. The first Photokina was held in Cologne, Germany, in 1950, and since 1966 it has been held biennially in September at the Koelnmesse Trade Fair and Exhibition Centre in Deutz. The final Photokina under the then-current biennial cycle took place in 2018. Initially, the promoters planned to start a new annual cycle in 2019, with future shows to be held in May, but they later decided not to begin the new annual cycle until 2020. The worldwide outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 and its effect on the imaging industry made Koelnmesse decide to cancel both Photokina 2020 and Photokina 2021. Many photographic and imaging companies introduce and showcase state of the art imaging products at Photokina.

==Similar trade shows==
The show has two main competitors, both of which are annual shows held in different parts of the world. The CP+ show in Yokohama, Japan, originally the Japan Camera Show, has been held since the early 1960s. In the U.S., the main photography show is PMA@CES, which since 2012 has coincided with the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

==History==
The first Photokina was held in 1950 at the initiative of . U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a greeting telegram marking the opening of Photokina in 1956.
* The 2008 show featured 1,579 exhibitors from 46 countries and had over 169,000 visitors from 161 countries.
* The 2010 Photokina took place from 21 to 26 September. It featured 1,251 suppliers from 45 countries and had over 180,000 visitors from 160 countries.
* The number of visitors still increased to 185,000 from 166 countries for Photokina 2012, which took place from 18 to 23 September 2012 and hosted 1,158 suppliers from 41 countries. The 2014 attendance remained roughly constant, at an estimated 185,000. The 2016 Photokina had about 191,000 visitors.
* Photokina 2018 was held in Cologne, Germany from 26 to 29 September 2018. The dates were originally announced as 25–30 September, but the format was shortened as a part of the change to an annual event.
*Photokina 2020, the first in the new annual cycle of events, was planned held once again in Cologne, 27–30 May 2020, but was cancelled because of the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 as well as Photokina 2021.
*On November 27, 2020, Koelnmesse announced that Photokina is suspended until further notice.

<text>American River College (ARC) is a public community college in unincorporated Sacramento, California. It is part of the California Community Colleges System.

==History==
The college was opened in 1955 as American River Junior College (ARJC), on the site of the old Grant Technical College. It moved to its current location in 1958, occupying eight newly built office complexes and the original Cameron ranch house. In 1965 the college became a part of the Los Rios Community College District and became American River College. Today, along with Cosumnes River College, Folsom Lake College and Sacramento City College, ARC is directed by a seven-member board of trustees elected by voters residing in the district.

The climactic police showdown of the 1986 Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore film &quot;Wisdom&quot; was filmed on the American River campus, including in and around Beaver Stadium.

During the period of 2004–2013, the college opened a variety of new facilities, including buildings for Health Education, Theater &amp; Music, Kinesiology, and Life Science and Fine Arts. In addition, the college also expanded its bookstore and library and opened a new Student Center and parking garage. In 2014 the college opened the 19,000 square foot Evangelisti Culinary Arts Center, which houses the college&#x27;s hospitality management program and student-run Oak Cafe restaurant and bakery. In 2021 the college opened the 57,000 square foot Diane Bryant STEM Innovation Center, which houses a variety of academic programs.

In 2008, the student body association supported California Proposition 8 which sought to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples. In 2010 the Board of Trustees lost a lawsuit against the student body association.

== Campus ==

The college occupies a site on the old Cameron Ranch in northern Sacramento County.

== Students ==
The college enrolls about 35,000 full-time and part-time students, making it one of the largest community colleges in California. ARC has published its own literary journal since 1984, the &quot;American River Review&quot;.

== Student life ==

<doc id="1187122" wikidata="Q20035" url="?curid=1187122" title="Linguine">
<text>Linguine (, ; English: ; sometimes anglicized as linguini) is a type of Italian pasta similar to fettuccine and &quot;trenette&quot;, but elliptical in section rather than flat. It is about in width, which is wider than spaghetti, but not as wide as fettuccine. Linguine was traditionally served with sauces such as pesto, but others such as tomato or fish based sauces are popular as well.

Linguine originated in Italy and is based on more traditional pastas. It is a type of pasta that finds its origin in the city of Genoa. Linguine is typically available in both white flour and whole-wheat versions, but was originally made with durum wheat. In the United States, National Linguine Day occurs on 15 September every year.

==Etymology==
Linguine comes from the Latin word &quot;lingua&quot;, meaning &#x27;tongue&#x27;. The modern language closest to Latin is Italian, and the Italian word &quot;linguine&quot;, plural of the feminine &quot;linguina&quot;, means &#x27;little tongues&#x27;. A thinner version of linguine is called &quot;linguettine&quot;. Linguine is one of the types of pasta whose name describes its shape (narrow flat pasta).

==History==
Linguine, a type of flattened spaghetti, was initially documented in the 1700s in Genoa, Italy, by Giulio Giacchero, an economist writer; Giacchero, author of a book on the economy of Genoa in the 1700&#x27;s, writes about linguine served with green beans, potatoes and a Genovese specialty—basil pesto. He claims it was the typical festive dish of Ligurian families of the 1700s.

Liguria is the coastal region in far northwest Italy on the Ligurian Sea, dominated by the ancient port of Genoa. Basil pesto is a traditional dish there, and is often called by its full name &quot;pesto alla genovese&quot;. That is why pesto dishes are typically served over linguine.

==Production==
The production of linguine involves mixing semolina flour or durum flour and water to form a dough, which is then rolled out and cut into flat strands. Traditionally, pasta-making was a labor-intensive process carried out by hand, but modern production methods have streamlined the process.

Wheat can also be ground into whole-wheat flour, then kneaded with water to make whole grain linguine.

==Nutrition==
Linguine provides sources of energy, carbohydrates, fibers, fat, protein, and minerals.

==Preparation==
Dry linguine is cooked in a pot of salted, boiling water.

The linguine is stirred gently to prevent sticking together and cooked for 8–10 minutes or until al dente.

While the noodles cook, desired sauce is prepared in a separate pan. Linguine is then drained using a colander. A small cup of pasta water is reserved as it is used to adjust the consistency of sauce later.

==Linguine vs. spaghetti==
Linguine and spaghetti are two pasta types in Italian cuisine. These pastas have several similarities and one key difference:

Shape:

* The primary difference between linguine and spaghetti.
* Linguine is a flat noodle.
* Spaghetti is a round noodle.
* Linguine&#x27;s flat shape provides a surface area for clinging to sauces, making it more common for seafood dishes.

Wheat:

* Linguine and spaghetti are traditionally made with durum or semolina flour.
* These types of pasta can technically be made from any type of flour, such as potato or rice, but the traditional forms use wheat.

Long pasta:

* There are many different types of pasta with varying pasta shapes, such as penne, farfalle, rigatoni, macaroni, fusilli, ziti, lasagna, and tagliatelle.
* Linguine and spaghetti belong to the category of pasta known as long pasta. 
* Other pastas with long noodles include fettuccine, angel hair, and capellini.

Preparation:

* Many pasta recipes call for noodles to be prepared al dente, meaning they are removed from the hot water while still slightly firm.
* Both spaghetti and linguine dishes are cooked this way.

<doc id="1187124" wikidata="Q2872182" url="?curid=1187124" title="Australian Technology Network">
<text>The Australian Technology Network (ATN) is a network of six Australian universities, with a strong history of innovation, enterprise and working closely with industry. ATN traces its origins back to 1975 as the Directors of Central Institutes of Technology (DOCIT), and was revived in 1999 in its present form with changes to its membership announced in 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2023.

ATN is the second largest university grouping in Australia, in terms of student numbers and research funding.

==History==
The ATN originated in 1975 as the &quot;Directors of Central Institutes of Technology (DOCIT)&quot;, a conference group consisting of the directors of Australia&#x27;s leading &quot;institutes of technology&quot;. Each of DOCIT&#x27;s original member institutions (NSWIT, QIT, RMIT, SAIT and WAIT) were located in the central business district of their respective state&#x27;s capital city, hence they were deemed &quot;central institutes of technology&quot;.

DOCIT founded its original member institutes&#x27; distinctiveness on their size (they enrolled almost one third of all full-time advanced education students), on the advanced level of their teaching (most of their programs were degrees rather than the diplomas like that of other advanced education institutions) and their conduct of applied research (DEET, 1993:18). They were therefore like a &quot;technology-focused&quot; group.

DOCIT encountered too much opposition to its aspirations, and disbanded in 1982. The conference group was later revived in 1999 as the Australian Technology Network, consisting of: the Curtin University of Technology, Queensland University of Technology, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, University of South Australia and University of Technology Sydney. Each ATN member university was granted public university status between 1986 and 1992, however their antecedents make them some of the oldest tertiary institutions in Australia.

QUT departed ATN on 28 September 2018.

Deakin University was announced as a new ATN member on 8 December 2020, bringing the Network&#x27;s membership back up to five universities and making the network Australia&#x27;s second largest university grouping in terms of student numbers and research funding. Deakin&#x27;s membership bolsters ATN&#x27;s geographic footprint with a presence in the regional gateway city of Geelong and regional Victoria.

In November 2021, the University of Newcastle joined the Australian Technology Network as an Associate Member, becoming the sixth member of the network. Newcastle&#x27;s membership further enahnced ATN&#x27;s regional footprint into the Central Coast and Hunter regions. The University of Newcastle became a full member in 2023.

<text>The Natural is a 1952 novel about baseball by Bernard Malamud, and is his debut novel. The story follows Roy Hobbs, a baseball prodigy whose career is sidetracked after being shot by a woman whose motivation remains mysterious. The story mostly concerns his attempts to return to baseball later in life, when he plays for the fictional New York Knights with his self-made bat &quot;Wonderboy&quot;.

Based loosely on the shooting incident and subsequent comeback of Philadelphia Phillies player Eddie Waitkus, the story of Roy Hobbs takes some poetic license and embellishes what was a memorable account of a career lost too soon. Apart from both Waitkus and Hobbs both being shot by women, there are few other similarities. It has been alternately suggested by historian Thomas Wolf that the shooting incident might have been inspired by Chicago Cubs shortstop Billy Jurges, who was shot by a showgirl with whom he was romantically linked, but Wolf offered no evidence to support this claim.

A film adaptation, &quot;The Natural&quot;, starring Robert Redford as Roy Hobbs, was released in 1984.

==Plot==

Nineteen-year-old Roy Hobbs is traveling by train to Chicago with his manager Sam to try out for the Chicago Cubs. Other passengers include sportswriter Max Mercy; Walter &quot;The Whammer&quot; Whambold, the leading hitter in the American League and three-time American League Most Valuable Player (based on Babe Ruth); and Harriet Bird, a beautiful and mysterious woman. The train stops at a carnival along the rail where The Whammer challenges Hobbs to strike him out. Hobbs does, to everyone&#x27;s surprise and The Whammer&#x27;s humiliation. Back on the train Harriet Bird strikes up a conversation with Hobbs, who never suspects that Bird has an ulterior motive. In fact, she is a lunatic obsessed with shooting the best baseball player.

In Chicago, Hobbs checks into his hotel and receives a call from Bird, who is also staying there. When he goes to her room, she shoots him in the stomach.

The novel picks up 16 years later in the dugout of the New York Knights, a National League baseball team. The team has been on a losing streak, and manager Pop Fisher&#x27;s and assistant manager Red Blow&#x27;s careers appear to be winding to an ignominious end. During one losing game, Roy Hobbs emerges from the clubhouse tunnel and announces that he is the team&#x27;s new right fielder, having just been signed by Knights co-owner Judge Banner. Pop and Red take Hobbs under their wing, and Red tells Hobbs about Fisher&#x27;s plight as manager of the Knights. The Judge wants to take over Pop&#x27;s share in the team but cannot until the season ends and provided the Knights fail to win the National League pennant.

Roy has practical jokes played upon him, including the theft of his &quot;Wonderboy&quot; bat. Once he gets his first chance at the plate, however, he proves to be a &quot;natural&quot; at the game. During one game, Pop substitutes Hobbs as a pinch hitter for team star Bump Bailey, intending to teach Bailey a lesson for not hustling. A few days later, a newly hustling Bump attempts to play a fly ball. He runs into the outfield wall, later dying from the impact. Roy takes over Bump&#x27;s position.

Max Mercy reappears, searching for details of Hobbs&#x27; past. At the same time, Hobbs has been attempting to negotiate a higher salary with the judge. Mercy introduces Hobbs to bookie Gus Sands, who is keeping company with Memo Paris, Pop&#x27;s niece. Hobbs has been infatuated with Memo, and his magic tricks appear to impress her.

Max Mercy writes a column about the judge&#x27;s refusal to grant Hobbs a raise, and a fan uprising ensues. Pop warns Hobbs about Memo, saying she imparts bad luck on the people she associates with. Hobbs dismisses the warning and falls into a hitting slump. He finally hits a home run during a game where a mysterious woman rises from her seat. Her name is Iris Lemon, and Roy courts her. However, upon learning she is a grandmother at age 33, he loses interest and returns his attention to Memo Paris.

Memo rebuffs Roy&#x27;s advances; he leads the Knights to a 17-game winning streak. With the Knights one game from winning the National League pennant, Roy attends a party hosted by Memo. He collapses there and awakens in the hospital. The doctor says he can play in the final game of the season but must retire after that if he wants to live. Hobbs wants to start a family with Memo and realizes he will need money.

The judge offers Hobbs a bribe to lose the Knights’ final game. That night, he reads a letter from Iris. After seeing the word &quot;grandmother&quot; in the letter, he discards it. He plays the next day and fouls a pitch into the stands that injures Iris and splits the Wonderboy bat down its length. Iris tells Roy that she is pregnant with his child, and now he is determined to do his best for their future. At the end of the game, Hobbs sees a chance to win. He comes to bat against Herman Youngberry, a brilliant young pitcher similar to Hobbs at the same age. Youngberry strikes out Hobbs, ending the season for the Knights. As Hobbs sits bemoaning the end of the season and possibly his career, Mercy finds out that Hobbs was paid to throw the game. If this report from Mercy is true, Roy will be expelled from the game and all of his records removed.

==Major characters==

*Roy Hobbs – &quot;The Natural&quot; – Roy Hobbs, who is the protagonist of this story, is a former teenage pitching phenomenon whose career dreams were derailed after a mysterious woman shot and seriously wounded him as he traveled to Chicago to try out for a Major League baseball team. This story follows Roy’s comeback to be one of the greats of the game, where he ultimately falls short in the spiritual, and intellectual capacity area. But his talent on the baseball field makes him look like a mythical hero. Although in the end, in this case the hero is unable to deliver. Money, lust, and human weakness triumph over heroism in many cases in life. This story shows how, like life, the same thing can happen in baseball. Life, and baseball create circumstances in which people are left with choices, and what Roy did with those choices in this story determined the outcome of his life, and or your game. In life the good guy can not always come out on top, he doesn’t always win. The same goes for baseball. This novel uses Roy to discuss the beautiful parallel between the two, and how they compare well, while also complementing each other. Baseball, which has a rich history, is the most relatable sport when it comes to relatability, triumph, and failure, highs, and lows.
*Memo Paris – Roy&#x27;s main love interest throughout the story, Memo is Pop Fisher&#x27;s niece and is often in the company of Sands. She is generally unhappy and leads Roy on for most of the novel.
*Pop Fisher – The grizzled manager of the New York Knights, Pop was once a fine player who is remembered for making a crucial error in his playing career and for never winning the big game. His name and situation are suggestive of the Fisher King of legend.
*Max Mercy – A seedy journalist who is more concerned with unearthing facts about the players&#x27; personal lives than covering the sport itself. Mercy meets Hobbs in the beginning of the novel and later spends most of his time trying to uncover his dark secrets.
*Gus Sands – A morally bankrupt bookie who enjoys placing bets against Hobbs until he persuades him to take a dive in the final game. He is also always around Memo, despite Roy&#x27;s protests.
*Iris Lemon – A fan of Roy&#x27;s who helps him break his slump in the middle of the season. Iris makes a deep connection with Roy, although he favors Memo over her until the end of the novel.
*Harriet Bird – The mysterious woman the teen-aged Roy meets on the train when he is en route to Chicago at the beginning of the novel. She later shoots him in her hotel room before committing suicide. Her character is loosely based on Ruth Ann Steinhagen, a disturbed 19-year-old baseball fan who, obsessed with Eddie Waitkus, shot and nearly killed him in 1949.

<text>Goa Vidyaprasarak Mandal, founded in 1911, is one of the prominent educational institutions in Goa, a small state on the west coast of India. It operates two senior colleges, including a college of education, one higher secondary school, five high schools and one kindergarten and primary school.

==History==
Dr. Dada Vaidya, Sitaram Kerkar and Vinayak Sarjyotishi founded Goa Vidyaprasarak Mandal and its first institution, A.J. de Almeida High School, in the Ponda taluk of central Goa. The school was named after António José de Almeida, a Portuguese republican statesman during Portugal&#x27;s rule in Goa. 

During the campaign against Portuguese colonial rule, the Goa Vidyaprasarak Mandal and A.J. de Almeida High School were centres of nationalist activities and thus have a long list of freedom fighters as their alumni. The founders thought of imparting education for white-collared jobs and for upgrading the standards of the common man through vocational training.

After Portuguese rule ended in 1961, four more high schools were founded in Bandora, Savoi Verem, Borim and Khandepar between 1962 and 1965. All of these are villages in the Ponda region of Goa. In 1975, a primary and kindergarten school was started in Ponda and, with the introduction of 10+2+3 pattern of education (which involves ten years of schooling, followed by two years of &#x27;higher secondary&#x27;, and finally three more years in college before being awarded a Bachelor&#x27;s degree), a higher secondary school was started in 1975 in Ponda.

In 1985, Goa University came into existence. During its &quot;amrit mahotsav&quot; (platinum jubilee) year, Goa Vidyaprasarak Mandal planned to start a senior college in Ponda, which became a reality on June 12, 1986 with the cooperation of Goa University, Goa Government authorities, well-wishers, teachers, members and students. On March 13, 1994 the college was named after late &quot;Gopal Govind Poy Raiturcar&quot;.

<doc id="1187135" wikidata="Q3139123" url="?curid=1187135" title="Islam in the Comoros">
<text>Islam is the largest religion in the Comoros. According to the 2006 estimate by the U.S. Department of State, roughly 98% of the population in the Comoros is Muslim. Virtually all Muslims in the Comoros are Sunni belonging to Shafi&#x27;i school of jurisprudence. Most adherents are Arab-Swahili, but there are also people of Indian, largely Gujarati, descent.

==History==
Local legend claims Islam was brought to the islands during Muhammad’s lifetime, brought by two Comorian nobles, Fey Bedja Mwamba and Mtswa Mwandze, who visited Mecca. Foreign Muslim merchants likely had a presence in the area as far back as the 9th or 10th century, due to the Comoros being actively involved in the Indian Ocean trade at the time. It&#x27;s possible that small minorities of native Comorians could have converted to Islam during that time.

Historical evidence suggests Arab merchants and exiled Zayidi Persian Shirazi princes first introduced the religion. Islam has long played a central role in the Comoros. Ruling families learned Arabic, performed &quot;Hajj&quot;, and maintained ties with other Muslim communities, such as Kilwa, Zanzibar and Hadramawt. Several Sufi &quot;tariqa&quot;, including the Shadhili, the Qadiriya, and the Rifa&#x27;i, are also active.

Hassan ibn Issa, a 16th-century Shirazi chief who claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, encouraged conversion and constructed numerous &quot;masaajid&quot;. In the 19th century, Sheikh Abdalah Darwesh initiated the Shadiliya &quot;tariqa&quot; in the Comoros. Born in Grande Comore, Sheikh Darwesh traveled throughout the Middle East and later converted Said Muhammad Al-Maarouf (d. 1904), who became the Shadilya’s supreme guide. Sheikh Al-Ami ibn Ali al-Mazruwi (d. 1949) was the first of the region&#x27;s &quot;ulama&quot; to author Islamic literature in Swahili. Al-Habib Omar b. Ahmed Bin Sumeit (d. 1976) studied in Arab countries before serving as teacher and &quot;qadi&quot; in Madagascar, Zanzibar, and, after 1967, the Comoros.

==Mosques and holy places==

Hundreds of mosques are scattered throughout the islands, as well as numerous &quot;madrassah&quot;. Practically all children attend Quranic School for two or three years, usually starting around the age of five; there they learn the rudiments of Islam and Arabic linguistics. When rural children attend these schools, they sometimes move away from home and assist their teacher in working his land. In 1998, a new Grand Mosque, financed by the emir of Sharjah, was inaugurated in Moroni. The tombs of Islamic holy men and founders of ṭarīqah are frequently visited on religious occasions.

==Holidays and festivals==
Comorians follow religious observances conscientiously and strictly adhere to religious orthodoxy. During colonization, the French did not attempt to supplant Islamic practices and were careful to respect the precedents of &quot;sharia&quot; as interpreted by the Shafi&#x27;i school of thought. All Muslim holidays are observed, including &quot;Id al-Adha, Muharram, Ashura, Mawlid, Laylat al-Mi&#x27;raj&quot; and Ramadan. Mawlid is marked by celebrations culminating in a feast prepared for the ulama. Many women wear the &quot;chirumani&quot;, a printed cloth worn around the body. Comorians often consult mwalimus or and marabouts for healing and protection from &quot;jinn&quot;. &quot;Mwalimus&quot; activate &quot;jinn&quot; to determine propitious days for feasts, have a successful marriage, conduct healing ceremonies, and prepare amulets containing Quranic &quot;ayat&quot;.

==Political Islam==
The chaotic economic and political climate since independence in 1975 has been detrimental to the development of human rights and social justice. Rival factions have sought to mobilize religious support both to uphold and contest political power and social inequality. Political opponents have relied on their own interpretation of the Quran and &quot;hadith&quot;, advocating &quot;Shariah&quot; to rectify political corruption. Competing Islamic views have entered politics, both to justify and challenge the government. European trained government officials have adopted Western political ideologies and secularism while continuing to support leaders of Islamic brotherhoods. Islamism and Wahhabism has become increasingly as students returned from Islamic studies abroad. In response to perceived injustice and chaos within the Comorian government, Islamists hope to create an Islamic republic. Suspected al-Qaeda member Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was born in Moroni in the Comoros and has Kenyan as well as Comorian citizenship.

<doc id="1187139" wikidata="Q587388" url="?curid=1187139" title="Mohelnice">
<text>Mohelnice (; ) is a town in Šumperk District in the Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 9,600 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Mohelnice consists of eight municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Mohelnice (7,717)
*Křemačov (157)
*Květín (134)
*Libivá (212)
*Podolí (390)
*Řepová (154)
*Studená Loučka (176)
*Újezd (201)
Studená Loučka forms an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Geography==
Mohelnice is located about south of Šumperk and northwest of Olomouc. The eastern part of the municipal territory of Mohelnice lies in the Mohelnice Depression lowland. The western part lies in the Zábřeh Highlands. The highest point is the hill Hekelův kopec at above sea level.

In the eastern part are located two artificial lakes created by flooding sandstone quarries, Mohelnické and Moravičanské. The easternmost part of Mohelnice with Moravičanské Lake is situated in the Litovelské Pomoraví Protected Landscape Area. The Mírovka Creek flows through the town into the Morava River, which forms the eastern municipal border.

==History==

The first written mention of Mohelnice is in a deed of bishop Jindřich Zdík from 1141, when it was owned by the Olomouc bishopric. In 1273, Mohelnice was first referred to as a town.

In 1307 and 1312, the town was devastated by plague. In 1424, it was conquered by the Hussites and 700 people died. During the first half of the 16th century, the town was rebuilt and the town fortifications were built. The Thirty Years&#x27; War devastated Mohelnice – in 1623 it was plundered by the Swedish troops and over 30% of the inhabitants died of the plague. The Swedes looted the town again in 1642, 1643, 1644 and 1647. Half of the town was destroyed by fire in 1662. 1685 saw the notorious witch trials during which a local vicar Alois Lautner was burned at the stake.

The town&#x27;s textile industry began operating in 1713, and in 1714 the town suffered another plague. There was another significant fire in 1739, which destroyed more than half of the town. During the Silesian Wars the town was plundered several times. In 1772 Mohelnice had 1,867 inhabitants, in 1792 it was 3,887. There were cholera epidemics in 1832, 1849, 1851 and 1866. The town suffered from fire in 1841 and few smaller fires later. In 1863 Mohelnice built its first sanitation system.

In the 19th and 20th century the town was industrialised and various factories were established. In 1910 most of the old town walls were demolished.

Before World War II, the town had a German-speaking majority population. In 1938, the town was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. After the war, the German population was expelled. This caused the town to become almost deserted. Within a few months, however, the town was repopulated by families from other parts of Czechoslovakia.

In the second half of the 20th century the town went through major urban changes, including the narrowing of the Mírovka Creek.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Mohelnice is predominantly industrial town with significant electrotechnical, engineering and construction industries. There is an industrial zone on the eastern outskirts of the town. The largest employer based in the town are Hella Autotechnik Nova, manufacturer of lighting for the automotive industry. With more than 3,000 employees, it is the largest industrial company in the Olomouc Region. The second most notable company in the town is Montix (manufacturer of plastic parts, especially for the automotive industry).

The I/35 road (part of the European route E442) passes through the town. It replaces the unfinished section of the D35 motorway from Olomouc to the Hradec Králové Region. The I/44 road splits from it and connects Mohelnice with Šumperk and Jeseník.

Mohelnice is located on the railway lines Prague–Olomouc (further continuing to Vsetín or Staré Město) and Nezamyslice–Kouty nad Desnou.

==Culture==
From 1975, Mohelnice was known for the folk and country music festival &quot;Mohelnický dostavník&quot;. The tradition ended in 2020.

==Sights==

The historic centre consists of the historic floor plan of the town with a central square and annular streets. The Svobody Square is partially lined by two-storey burgher houses. Remains of the walls and the northern entrance gate from 1540 have been preserved from the town fortifications.

The second important area is the Kostelní Square with the parish Church of Saint Thomas of Canterbury. The original church on this site was first mentioned in 1247. This church was expanded in the 14th century, and rebuilt in the 15th century after it was burned down. Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque style intertwines in its construction. The last modifications were in the Neo-Gothic style. It has a rich baroque interior decoration. The church tower is the landmark of the town.

The Church of St. Stanislaus was built in 1584. It was baroque reconstructed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The Bishop&#x27;s Castle on the Kostelní Square is one of the oldest preserved buildings in whole region. It was built in the 13th century at the latest. Today, there is a regional museum.

<text>Major-General Charles Howard Foulkes, CB, CMG, DSO (1 February 1875 – 6 May 1969) was a Royal Engineers officer in the British Army and also a British international field hockey player who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics in the bronze medal-winning team. He saw service in World War I and, following the first German use of gas on 22 April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres, became Britain&#x27;s chief advisor on gas warfare. He also advised on the use of gas to suppress the uprisings in Afghanistan (1919) and Waziristan (1920), but gas was never actually deployed in these conflicts.

==Military career==
Foulkes was educated at Bedford Modern School, and was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant on 27 February 1894, followed by promotion to lieutenant on 27 February 1897. He served in Sierra Leone 1898–99 (later known as the Hut Tax War), for which he received the East and West Africa Medal. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, he was appointed on the Staff of the army in South Africa, and took part in a number of engagements and operations. He became Assistant Commissioner for the Anglo-French Boundary Commission in the East of Niger in late 1902, with the local rank of captain. After taking part in the Kano-Sokoto expedition which brought the Emirs in Nigeria under British control in 1903, he became Commander of the Ordnance Survey of Scotland in 1904. He was a member of the bronze medal-winning team for the field hockey in the 1908 Summer Olympics. He went on to be Commander of 31st (Fortress) Company in Ceylon in 1909 and Commander of &#x27;L&#x27; Company at the Royal Engineers Depot in Chatham in 1913.

Foulkes served in World War I as Commander of 11th (Field) Company, taking part in the First Battle of Ypres in 1914 before becoming Britain&#x27;s chief advisor on gas warfare in 1915 and General Officer Commanding the Special Brigade responsible for Chemical Warfare and Director of Gas Services in June 1917, for which he was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general, taking over from Henry Fleetwood Thuillier.

He advised on the use of gas to suppress the uprisings in Afghanistan in 1919 and Waziristan in 1920, although gas was never actually deployed in these conflicts, before becoming Commander Royal Engineers in Fermoy and Director of Irish Propaganda in 1921. He went on to be Commander, Royal Engineers in Northumbria in 1922, Deputy Chief Engineer at Southern Command in 1924 and Chief Engineer at Aldershot Command in 1926 before retiring in 1930. In June 1928 he was appointed a personal aide-de-camp to King George V.

<text>Andrew Cecil Bradley, (26 March 1851 – 2 September 1935) was an English literary scholar, best remembered for his work on Shakespeare.

==Life==
Bradley was born at Park Hill, Clapham, then in Surrey but now part of London. His father was the preacher Charles Bradley (1789–1871), vicar of Glasbury, a noted evangelical Anglican preacher and leader of the so-called Clapham Sect. Charles had thirteen children (twelve surviving) by his first wife, who died in 1831, and nine by his second wife Emma Linton. Bradley was the youngest of the nine born to Emma and Charles; his older brother, philosopher Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924), was the fifth. An older half-brother was Rev. George Granville Bradley (1821–1903), who was Dean of Westminster.

Bradley studied at Balliol College, Oxford. He obtained a Balliol Fellowship in 1874 and lectured first in English and subsequently in philosophy until 1881. He then took a permanent position at the University of Liverpool where he lectured on literature. In 1889 he moved to Glasgow as Regius Professor. In 1901 he was elected to the Oxford professorship of poetry. During his five years in this post he produced &quot;Shakespearean Tragedy&quot; (1904) and &quot;Oxford Lectures on Poetry&quot; (1909). He was later made an honorary fellow of Balliol and was awarded honorary doctorates from Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh (1899), and Durham, and was offered (but declined) the King Edward VII chair at Cambridge. Bradley never married; he lived in London with his sister and died at 6 Holland Park Road, Kensington, London, on 2 September 1935. His will established a research fellowship for young scholars of English Letters.

==Work==
The outcome of his five years as professor of poetry at the University of Oxford were Bradley&#x27;s two major works, &quot;Shakespearean Tragedy&quot; (1904), and &quot;Oxford Lectures on Poetry&quot; (1909). All his published work was originally delivered in the form of lectures. Bradley&#x27;s pedagogical manner and his self-confidence made him a real guide for many students to the meaning of Shakespeare. His influence on Shakespearean criticism was so great that the following poem by Guy 
Boas, &quot;Lays of Learning&quot;, appeared in 1926:

:I dreamt last night that Shakespeare’s Ghost
:Sat for a civil service post.
:The English paper for that year
:Had several questions on King Lear
:Which Shakespeare answered very badly
:Because he hadn’t read his Bradley.
::(Hawkes 1986 as cited in Taylor 2001: 46)

Though Bradley has sometimes been criticised for writing of Shakespeare&#x27;s characters as though they were real people, his book is probably the most influential single work of Shakespearean criticism ever published.

==Reputation==
&quot;Shakespearean Tragedy&quot; has been reprinted more than two dozen times and is itself the subject of a scholarly book, Katherine Cooke&#x27;s &quot;A. C. Bradley and His Influence in Twentieth-Century Shakespeare Criticism&quot;.
By the mid-twentieth century his approach became discredited for many scholars; often it is said to contain anachronistic errors and attempts to apply late 19th century novelistic conceptions of morality and psychology to early 17th century society. Kenneth Burke&#x27;s 1951 article &quot;Othello: An Essay to Illustrate a Method&quot; counters a Bradleyan reading of character, as L. C. Knights had earlier done with his 1933 essay &quot;How Many Children Had Lady Macbeth?&quot; (John Britton has pointed out that this was never a question actually posed by Bradley, and apparently was made up by F. R. Leavis as a mockery of &quot;current irrelevancies in Shakespeare criticism.&quot;) Since the 1970s, the prevalence of poststructuralist methods of criticism resulted in students turning away from his work, although a number of scholars have recently returned to considering &quot;character&quot; as a historical category of evaluation (for instance, Michael Bristol). Harold Bloom has paid tribute to Bradley&#x27;s place in the great tradition of critical writing on Shakespeare: &quot;This [Bloom&#x27;s] book – &quot;&quot; – is a latecomer work, written in the wake of the Shakespeare critics I most admire: Johnson, Hazlitt, Bradley.&quot; 

Bradley delivered the 1907–1908 Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, entitled &quot;Ideals of Religion.&quot; He also delivered the 1909 Adamson Lecture of the Victoria University of Manchester and the 1912 Shakespeare Lecture of the British Academy. Bradley&#x27;s other works include &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s Conception of the State&quot; in &quot;Hellenica&quot;, ed. Evelyn Abbott, London : Longmans, Green, 1st ed. 1880, 2nd ed., 1898, &quot;Poetry for Poetry&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1901), &quot;A Commentary on Tennyson&#x27;s in Memoriam&quot; (1901), and &quot;A Miscellany&quot; (1929).

<text>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is a subset of outsourcing that involves the contracting of the operations and responsibilities of a specific business process to a second-party service provider. Originally, this was associated with manufacturing firms, such as Coca-Cola that outsourced large segments of its supply chain.

BPO is typically categorized into back office outsourcing, which includes &quot;internal business functions&quot; such as human resources or finance and accounting, and front office outsourcing, which includes &quot;customer-related services&quot; such as contact centre (customer care) services.

BPO that is contracted outside a company&#x27;s country is called offshore outsourcing. BPO that is contracted to a company&#x27;s neighbouring (or nearby) country is called nearshore outsourcing.

One new concept in business process outsourcing (BPO) is mediation, which highlights the function of a third party in helping to choose outsourcing service providers. Agencies often juggle multiple brands and churn out cookie-cutter result, that heavily pulls growth. For example, companies like Brevon using a data-driven approach to eliminate the common challenges businesses face while outsourcing. 

Often the business processes are information technology-based, and are referred to as ITES-BPO, where ITES stands for Information Technology Enabled Service. Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) and legal process outsourcing (LPO) are some of the sub-segments of business process outsourcing industry.

== Benefits ==
The main advantage of any BPO is the way in which it helps increase a company&#x27;s flexibility. In early 2000s BPO was all about cost efficiency, which allowed a certain level of flexibility at the time. Due to technological advances and changes in the industry (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies who choose to outsource their back-office increasingly look for time flexibility and direct quality control. Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:

* BPO services are Financial and Accounting Services, Taxation and Insurance Services, E-Publishing and Web Promotion, Legal Services and Content Writing. Most services provided by BPO vendors are offered on a fee-for-service basis, using business models such as Remote In-Sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models. This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into variable costs. A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.
* Another way in which BPO contributes to a company’s flexibility is that a company is able to focus on its core competencies, without being burdened by the demands of bureaucratic restraints. Key employees are herewith released from performing non-core or administrative processes and can invest more time and energy in building the firm’s core businesses. The key lies in knowing which of the main value drivers to focus on – customer intimacy, product leadership, or operational excellence. Focusing more on one of these drivers may help a company create a competitive edge.
* A third way in which BPO increases organizational flexibility is by increasing the speed of business processes. Supply chain management with the effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing increases the speed of several business processes, such as the throughout in the case of a manufacturing company.
* Finally, flexibility is seen as a stage in the organizational life cycle: A company can maintain growth goals while avoiding standard business bottlenecks. BPO therefore allows firms to retain their entrepreneurial speed and agility, which they would otherwise sacrifice in order to become efficient as they expanded. It avoids a premature internal transition from its informal entrepreneurial phase to a more bureaucratic mode of operation.
* A company may be able to grow at a faster pace as it will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people or equipment that may take years to amortize, may become outdated or turn out to be a poor match for the company over time.

Although the above-mentioned arguments favour the view that BPO increases the flexibility of organizations, management needs to be careful with the implementation of it as there are issues, which work against these advantages. Among problems, which arise in practice are: A failure to meet service levels, unclear contractual issues, changing requirements and unforeseen charges, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. Consequently, these challenges need to be considered before a company decides to engage in business process outsourcing.

A further issue is that in many cases there is little that differentiates the BPO providers other than size. They often provide similar services, have similar geographic footprints, leverage similar technology stacks, and have similar Quality Improvement approaches.

== Threats ==
Risk is the major drawback with business process outsourcing. Outsourcing of an information system, for example, can cause security risks both from a communication and from a privacy perspective. For example, security of North American or European company data is more difficult to maintain when accessed or controlled in other countries. From a knowledge perspective, a changing attitude in employees, underestimation of running costs and the major risk of losing independence, outsourcing leads to a different relationship between an organization and its contractor.

Risks and threats of outsourcing must therefore be managed, to achieve any benefits. In order to manage outsourcing in a structured way, maximising positive outcome, minimising risks and avoiding any threats, a business continuity management model is set up. This model consists of a set of steps, to successfully identify, manage and control the business processes that are, or can be outsourced.

Analytic hierarchy process is a framework of BPO focused on identifying potential outsourceable information systems. L. Willcocks, M. Lacity and G. Fitzgerald identify several contracting problems companies face, ranging from unclear contract formatting, to a lack of understanding of technical IT processes.

=== Technological pressures ===
Industry analysts have identified robotic process automation software as a potential threat to the industry and speculate as to the likely long term impact. In the short term, however, there is likely to be little impact as existing contracts run their course: it is only reasonable to expect demand for cost efficiency and innovation to result in transformative changes at the point of contract renewals. With the average length of a BPO contract being 5 years or more – and many contracts being longer – this hypothesis will take some time to play out.

On the other hand, an academic study by the London School of Economics was at pains to counter the so-called &quot;myth&quot; that robotic process automation will bring back many jobs from offshore. One possible argument behind such an assertion is that new technology provides new opportunities for increased quality, reliability, scalability and cost control, thus enabling BPO providers to increasingly compete on an outcomes-based model rather than competing on cost alone. With the core offering potentially changing from a &quot;lift and shift&quot; approach based on fixed costs to a more qualitative, service-based and outcomes-based model, there is perhaps a new opportunity to grow the BPO industry with a new offering.

=== Financial risks ===
One of the primary reasons businesses choose to outsource is to reduce costs. However, this can also come with significant financial risks. If the cost of outsourcing increases due to changes in the global market or if the outsourced company increases its fees, the financial benefits can be eroded. In addition, hidden costs, such as transition and management costs, can also emerge. This can make outsourcing less financially viable than originally anticipated.

=== Loss of control ===
Outsourcing also potentially leads to a loss of control over certain business operations. This can create challenges in terms of managing and coordinating these operations. Moreover, the outsourced company might not fully understand or align with the hiring company&#x27;s business culture, values, and objectives, leading to potential conflicts and inefficiencies.

=== Quality control ===
Quality control can become more challenging when business operations are outsourced. While third-party companies might be experts in their fields, they may not maintain the same standards as the hiring company. This can result in a decline in the quality of goods or services, potentially damaging the company&#x27;s brand and customer relationships.

== Industry size ==

One estimate of the worldwide BPO market from the BPO Services Global Industry Almanac 2017, puts the size of the industry in 2016 at about US$140 billion.

India, China and the Philippines are major powerhouses in the industry. In 2017, in India the BPO industry generated US$30 billion in revenue according to the National Industry Association. The BPO industry is a small segment of the total outsourcing industry in India. The BPO industry workforce in India is expected to shrink by 14% in 2021.

The BPO industry and IT services industry in combination are worth a total of US$154 billion in revenue in 2017. The BPO industry in the Philippines generated $22.9 billion in revenues in 2016, while around 700 thousand medium and high skill jobs would be created by 2022.

In 2015, official statistics put the size of the total outsourcing industry in China, including not only the BPO industry but also IT outsourcing services, at $130.9 billion.

<text>The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant is a former factory located within the Milwaukee Junction area of Detroit, Michigan, in the United States. Built in 1904, it was the second center of automobile production for the Ford Motor Company, after the Ford Mack Avenue Plant. At the Piquette Avenue Plant, the company created and first produced the Ford Model T, the car credited with initiating the mass use of automobiles in the United States. Prior to the Model T, several other car models were assembled at the factory. Early experiments using a moving assembly line to make cars were also conducted there. It was also the first factory where more than 100 cars were assembled in one day. While it was headquartered at the Piquette Avenue Plant, Ford Motor Company became the biggest U.S.-based automaker, and it would remain so until the mid-1920s. The factory was used by the company until 1910, when its car production activity was relocated to the new, larger Highland Park Ford Plant.

Studebaker bought the factory in 1911, using it to assemble cars until 1933. The building was sold in 1936, going through a series of owners for the rest of the 20th century before becoming a museum in 2001. The Piquette Avenue Plant is the oldest purpose-built automotive factory building open to the public. The museum, which was visited by over 31,000 people in 2018, has exhibits that primarily focus on the beginning of the United States automotive industry. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, became a Michigan State Historic Site in 2003, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006.

==History==
===Ford period===
Henry Ford, Detroit coal merchant Alexander Y. Malcomson, and a group of investors formed the Ford Motor Company on June 16, 1903, to assemble automobiles. The company&#x27;s first car model, the original Ford Model A, began to be assembled that same month at the Ford Mack Avenue Plant, a rented wagon manufacturing shop in Detroit, Michigan. The company quickly outgrew this facility and, on April 10, 1904, bought a parcel of land off of Piquette Avenue in Detroit to accommodate a larger factory. The land was located in the Milwaukee Junction area, whose name is derived from a railroad junction within it. The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant&#x27;s construction started on May 10, 1904. The company moved into its new factory the following October.

The Detroit-based architectural firm Field, Hinchman &amp; Smith designed the Piquette Avenue Plant. It is an example of late Victorian-style architecture and was modeled after New England textile mills. Designing factories based on this type of mill was common practice in the United States at the time. The building is three stories high, wide, and long. Its load-bearing exterior brick walls contain 355 windows, and its maple floors, supported by square oak beams and posts, cover . The Piquette Avenue Plant contains two elevator-stairwell combinations, one located on its northwest corner and the other located on its southwest side. Recalling a fire in March 1901 that destroyed the Olds Motor Works factory in Detroit, Henry Ford and the architects included a fire sprinkler system in the building&#x27;s design, a rare feature for industrial buildings of the period. This and several other original safety features in the factory, such as its firewalls, fire doors, and fire escapes, are still present. Water for the sprinkler system was supplied by a wooden water tank located on the building&#x27;s roof. A brick powerhouse, measuring wide by long, was the original electricity provider for the factory, and was located near its northwest corner. The water tank and powerhouse no longer exist.
From October 1904 to the end of 1909, Ford Motor Company assembled car models B, C, F, K, N, R, S, and T at the Piquette Avenue Plant. Ford models B and C were the first car models produced at the factory starting in late 1904, and production of the Ford Model F began the following February. Most of the factory tasks were done by men, except for magneto assembly, which was done by women. Hand tools were used for the assembly work at fixed stations, and the completed components would be brought by hand to the chassis for final assembly. Completed cars were shipped to the company&#x27;s distributors and dealers by rail using a spur line behind the building, which connected to a Michigan Central Railroad main line. Due to variations in demand and car model changeover, the number of employees varied constantly, ranging from as low as 300 to as high as 700. The company did not recognize labor unions at the factory. Ford Motor Company was a member of the Employers’ Association of Detroit, an organization that prevented most of the city&#x27;s factories from unionizing until the 1930s.

In 1905, Ford Motor Company was the fourth-largest car producer in the United States, behind Cadillac, Rambler, and Oldsmobile. In the company&#x27;s early years, most major components in its cars were manufactured by outside companies, including the &quot;running gear&quot; (the chassis, engine, transmission, drive shaft, and axles), which was supplied by the Dodge Brothers Company. That began to change in early 1906, when the Ford Manufacturing Company, a new, separate company created by Henry Ford and some Ford Motor Company stockholders, started to make engines and transmissions for the upcoming Ford Model N. The Ford Manufacturing Company was located at the Bellevue Avenue Plant, a leased factory off of Bellevue Avenue in Detroit. The Bellevue Avenue Plant was used until 1908, by which time almost all manufacturing of major components for Ford Motor Company cars was taking place at the Piquette Avenue Plant. Model N production began at the Piquette Avenue Plant in July 1906. That same month, Henry Ford bought the Ford Motor Company shares owned by fellow company co-founder Alexander Malcomson. While Malcomson was with the company, he and Henry Ford disagreed over the type of car that the company should produce. Malcomson preferred expensive cars, like the Ford Model K; Henry Ford favored inexpensive cars, like the Model N. Once Malcomson was no longer part of the company, Henry Ford, now with uncontested control, focused the company&#x27;s efforts towards making cheap cars exclusively. The success of the Model N made Ford Motor Company the largest automaker in the United States by the end of 1906, a distinction that it would hold for twenty years.

In January 1907, in a room located on the Piquette Avenue Plant&#x27;s third floor in the northeast corner, the design process began for the Ford Model T, the car credited with starting the mass use of cars in the United States. Much of the design and experimental work for the new car was done by Henry Ford, draftsman Joseph Galamb, engineer Childe Harold Wills, and machinist C.J. Smith. Vanadium steel, an alloy lighter and stronger than standard steel, which was first used sparingly with the Ford Model N, R, and S, was used extensively with the Model T. The company revealed the plans for the Model T to its dealers on March 19, 1908.

During July 1908, a few months before the Model T&#x27;s introduction, a group of Piquette Avenue Plant employees experimented with the concept of using a moving assembly line to make cars, where the chassis would be moved to the workers for components to be installed. This effort was led by Charles E. Sorensen, the assistant to Peter E. Martin, who was the factory&#x27;s superintendent. Sorensen believed that a moving assembly line would make car assembly faster, simpler, and easier. The experiments consisted of tying a rope to a Model N chassis and pulling it across the factory&#x27;s third floor on skids until its axles and wheels were added. The chassis would then be rolled across the floor in notches, where specific components would be attached. At least one Model N was completed at the Piquette Avenue Plant using this process. Although Henry Ford encouraged these experiments, he did not implement a formal moving assembly line at the Piquette Avenue Plant, as all of his attention was focused on getting Model T production started on time. Despite not having a moving assembly line, the Piquette Avenue Plant, aided by the usage of interchangeable parts and other production improvements, produced 101 completed cars in a single day on June 4, 1908, an auto industry record at the time.

The first production Model T was completed at the Piquette Avenue Plant on September 27, 1908. On May 1, 1909, due to overwhelming demand, Ford Motor Company stopped taking Model T orders for two months. To satisfy the unprecedented demand for the Model T, the company moved most of its car production activity to the new, larger Highland Park Ford Plant in Highland Park, Michigan, by January 1910. The company completely vacated the Piquette Avenue Plant by October 1910. The concept of using a moving assembly line to manufacture cars would be fully implemented at the Highland Park Ford Plant, starting on October 7, 1913. Over 15 million Model T&#x27;s would eventually be built, and the first 14,000 made in the United States were assembled at the Piquette Avenue Plant.

===After Ford in the 20th century===

The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant was sold in January 1911 to Studebaker, a major maker of various horse-drawn road vehicles since the 1850s. That same year, when the railroad spur line serving the factory was raised above street level, the loading dock behind the building was replaced with an elevated platform, level with the second floor. Also in 1911, Studebaker acquired the E-M-F Company, which owned a different car manufacturing complex on Piquette Avenue. Studebaker began to put its name on the cars formerly produced by the E-M-F Company in 1912. In 1913, the plant was one of the sites affected by the 1913 Studebaker strike, the automotive industry&#x27;s first major labor strike. In 1920, Studebaker built a four-story, reinforced concrete building, known as the &quot;Studebaker Detroit Service Building&quot;, immediately west of the Piquette Avenue Plant. In 1926, the elevator-stairwell combination on the Piquette Avenue Plant&#x27;s southwest side was moved slightly northwards. This enabled the Detroit Service Building to be connected to the Piquette Avenue Plant&#x27;s southwest corner on the second and third floors, which created a ground-level, drive-through access point to the court between the two buildings. Also in 1926, the machinery for both of the Piquette Avenue Plant&#x27;s elevators was replaced. Studebaker used the Piquette Avenue Plant for car production until 1933.

In 1936, Studebaker sold the Piquette Avenue Plant to the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), a producer of rubber auto parts and non-adhesive paper tape. Around 1937, the powerhouse and several other small buildings previously built by Ford Motor Company west of the factory were demolished. The Cadillac Overall Company, a work clothes supplier, purchased the building in 1968. The Heritage Investment Company bought the building in 1989 and owned it until 2000. Since the early 1990s, a company named &quot;General Linen &amp; Uniform Service&quot; has occupied part of the Piquette Avenue Plant&#x27;s first floor. The Detroit Service Building next door is now used by Henry Ford Health System to store medical records. The openings that previously allowed direct access between the two buildings on the second and third floors are now sealed. The Piquette Avenue Plant still stands in spite of the decline of Detroit, which began in the mid-20th century.

==Model T Automotive Heritage Complex==

The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant was sold to the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex in April 2000. Model T Automotive Heritage Complex is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that has run the building as a museum since July 27, 2001. The Piquette Avenue Plant is the oldest purpose-built automotive factory building open to the public. The museum, located north of Midtown Detroit at 461 Piquette Avenue, attracted 31,018 visitors in 2018. It contains over 40 early automobiles built by Ford Motor Company and other Detroit-area car makers, as well as recreations of Henry Ford&#x27;s office and the room where the Ford Model T was designed. One of the cars on display is Model T Serial No. 220, which was built at the factory in December 1908, and is one of the oldest surviving examples of that car model. The museum&#x27;s regular operating days are Wednesdays through Sundays.

The Piquette Avenue Plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, designated as a Michigan State Historic Site in 2003, and became a National Historic Landmark in 2006. The building has also been a contributing property for the surrounding Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District since 2004. The factory&#x27;s front façade was fully restored to its 1904 appearance and revealed to the public on September 27, 2008, the 100th anniversary of the completion of the first production Model T. On August 11, 2011, Model T Automotive Heritage Complex membership chairman Tom Genova was honored with a ROSE Award from the Detroit Metro Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau in the Volunteers category. On May 18, 2012, the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex won a NAAMY Award from the National Association of Automobile Museums in the Films and Videos category for Division I (museums with budgets less than $300,000). On November 10, 2015, the Window Restoration Team at the Piquette Avenue Plant received a MotorCities National Heritage Area Award of Excellence in the Preservation category. Around 2016, the National Park Service considered adding the Piquette Avenue Plant to a list of places in the United States eligible for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. It was ultimately not added, because it did not have enough of its original factory equipment, and because of recommendations that its nomination be expanded to include other Detroit-area Ford Motor Company sites, such as the Highland Park Ford Plant and the Ford River Rouge Complex.

<doc id="1187181" wikidata="Q46055" url="?curid=1187181" title="Western Outlands">
<text>The Western (Bulgarian) Outlands () is a term used in Bulgarian to denote several regions located in ex-Yugoslavia, today southeastern Serbia and southeastern North Macedonia, that were traditionally part of Bulgaria and which were predominantly inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians (Bulgarians in Serbia, Bulgarians in North Macedonia).

The territories in question were ceded by Bulgaria to the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1920 as a result of the Treaty of Neuilly, following the First World War. According to the 2022 Serbian census, two municipalities, Bosilegrad and Dimitrovgrad, are populated primarily by ethnic Bulgarians.

==Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organization==

The Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organization (), IWORO, was a Bulgarian separatist organization active in the Western Outlands between 1921 and 1941 in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (until 1929), and then its successor, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

The organization was established in 1921 on the basis of several detachments created straight after the cession of the Western Outlands to Serbia in 1920. The IWORO initially concentrated on propaganda and delivery of Bulgarian literature. The period of armed conflict started in 1922 and the organisation carried out numerous assaults on the Tzaribrod–Belgrade railway, on bridges, Yugoslav garrisons and barracks until 1941 when the region was occupied by Bulgarian troops.

Unlike the other three Bulgarian revolutionary organizations active in the interwar period — the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation in Macedonia, the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation in Thrace and the Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organization in Dobruja — IWORO did not put up the tactical slogan demanding autonomy for the region but had an open separatist agenda; it fought “for the liberation of the Western Outlands and their restoration to Bulgaria”.

==Controversy==
The Serbian state deems the term controversial, considering that referring to parts of a neighboring country&#x27;s territory as &quot;western outlands&quot; can imply territorial claims, as in the example of Germany regarding Alsace in France.

For this reason, the term has not been used by Belgrade in contacts with Sofia since 1948. It was mentioned once, in the 1947 Bled Agreement by Josip Broz Tito and Georgi Dimitrov. This was in the period of discussion for a Communist super-state in the Balkans, the Balkan Federative Republic, which was to include Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria. It foresaw the return of the Western Outlands to Bulgaria. The BFR idea was abandoned with the Informbiro Resolution of 1948, when the split between Tito and Stalin occurred. Despite not being used internationally (until the 1990s when it was revived), it is very widely used in internal social and political communication in Bulgaria.

<text>Mírovka () is a creek in Šumperk District, Moravia, right tributary of the Morava River.
Its length is 20,2 km and its drainage basin covers 49.6 km2. The mean annual discharge at its mouth is 0.25 m³/s.

The Mírovka originates near Maletín village, 400 meters above sea level.

The Mírovka flows through settlements of Maletín, Starý Maletín, Svojanov and Nový Maletín which are grouped into single municipality called Maletín. Two water reservoirs were built in this place – the Svojanov reservoir and the Maletín reservoir. Upper the Maletín reservoir occupies approximately 2.6 ha, lower The Svojanov Reservoir occupies approximately 1.5 ha. Both are primarily used for fishing.

The Mírovka then goes east into forest of Moravsko-Třebovská pahorkatina (literally Moravská Třebová Hills), flowing next to a paved road. Mírov, the super-maximum security prison, is located in this area. Lower reaches are situated in agricultural flatland of Mohelnická brázda, feeding Křemačovský rybník, which area is 3 ha. Then the creek flows through Mohelnice. It empties into a millrace that is connected with the Morava, just few meters away from a border of the Litovelské Pomoraví Protected Landscape Area.

Moravičanské jezero (literally Moravičany lake) is in a neighborhood of the creek mouth. This manmade lake, which is a consequence of a sand mining, is widely used for recreation and fishery. It occupies about 90 ha.

<text>William George Bonin (January 8, 1947 – February 23, 1996), also called the Freeway Killer and the Freeway Strangler, was an American serial killer and sex offender who raped, tortured, and murdered young men and boys between November 1968 and June 1980 in southern California. He was convicted of 14 murders, but he confessed to 21 and is suspected of even more.

Bonin&#x27;s first known murder victim was killed in May 1979. He generally operated by luring his victims into his van under the pretense of having consensual sex. He became known as the &quot;Freeway Killer&quot; because most of his victims&#x27; bodies were discovered beside freeways. On many occasions, he was helped by one of his four known accomplices. One of them, Vernon Butts, was listed in court as an accomplice for 12 murders; he died via suicide before his trial in 1982.

Described by the prosecutor at his first trial as &quot;the most arch-evil person who ever existed&quot;, he spent 14 years on death row before his execution by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison in 1996. He was the first prisoner in California to die by this method.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
William George Bonin was born in Willimantic, Connecticut, on January 8, 1947, the second of three sons to Robert Leonard Bonin Sr. and Alice Dorothy Cote. Both parents were alcoholics, and his father an ill-tempered World War II veteran who physically abused his wife and children. His mother suffered from severe mood swings and frequented a bingo parlor while her sons remained unattended. She was regarded as having a domineering and emasculating presence in Bonin&#x27;s early life.

In January 1950, Bonin&#x27;s a compulsive gambler⁠gambled away their home in Andover, Connecticut, forcing the family to reside with Bonin&#x27;s maternal grandmother in Willimantic. In spite of this dysfunctional environment, Bonin and his brothers were actively raised Catholic and baptized according to church doctrine. They attended St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School, where staff repeatedly made complaints of Bonin&#x27;s aggression toward other students, truancy, and other misbehavior. After riding his bike into a group of young girls, he was briefly placed in juvenile hall. After returning home, he was reportedly more uncooperative toward his parents than before.

In September 1953, Bonin and his older brother, Robert Jr., were placed at the Franco-American School, a Catholic convent, in Lowell, Massachusetts. The convent enforced harsh discipline by staff, with extreme assault being commonplace. Bonin recalled nuns forcing him to punch a fence when he misbehaved. Records indicate he was observed to function well in this structured environment.

According to witnesses, Bonin was bullied, and was once sexually assaulted by an older boy in 1955. According to Bonin, the older boy approached Bonin for sex, and Bonin asked the boy to tie his hands behind his back, which he said would allow him to feel &quot;secure and less frightened.&quot; Bonin was then bound and sexually assaulted. 

During this time at the convent, neither parent visited Bonin or his brother, and Bonin became worried his parents had died. Bonin was to remain at the convent until May 1955, when he returned to live with his parents in a home owned by Bonin&#x27;s maternal grandfather in Mansfield.

In Mansfield, Bonin attended Annie Vinton Elementary School with his younger brother Paul, where he was ridiculed as &quot;Bugsie Bonin&quot;. He became a juvenile delinquent who quarreled with students. Bonin recalled feeling shame at his sexual attraction to younger children and male teachers. Neighbors later failed to recollect his parents spending time with their children, and one worried neighbor, observing they were unkempt and hungry, provided meals and clean clothes to Bonin and Paul out of sympathy.

Until Bonin&#x27;s first incarceration, the children were left with their maternal grandfather by Bonin&#x27;s mother, a known child molester who had sexually abused her. She later speculated her father molested his grandsons. Bonin and Paul were also left with Robert Jr., having received the brunt of their father&#x27;s abuse⁠often beat and belittled his siblings.

Largely devoid of consequences and parental supervision, Bonin stole hubcaps, license plates and metal tags off vehicles around town. In 1957 he was placed in a juvenile detention center for these and other petty crimes. While incarcerated, Bonin was molested by an adult counselor. Following his release, he began sexually fondling his younger brother Paul. After six months, however, Paul informed their mother of Bonin&#x27;s fondling, and Bonin was forced to sleep in a separate bedroom. Bonin later confessed to molesting young boys and exposing himself to a 10-year-old girl.

=== Adolescence ===

In 1959, Bonin attended middle school adjacent to Coventry High School. Despite showing a strong aptitude for math and science, he had otherwise mediocre grades. In late 1960, the family faced the prospect of foreclosure, and Bonin&#x27;s mother kicked their father out of the home, winning custody of the siblings. The parents reconciled however, after their father was offered lucrative employment as a machinist in Downey, California. In early 1962, they purchased a tract home in nearby Torrance.

Bonin attended North High School in Torrance, where he was regarded as a social outcast. However, Paul later recalled him as an outwardly well-behaved teenager. Bonin was uncomfortable around his peers, and is not known to have formed any friendships throughout his adolescence. He spent his time frequenting a local bowling alley.

By his teenage years, Bonin held an intense interest in pedophilia, but kept his emerging feelings a secret. His pederasty became the basis of conflict with his mother, leading to frequent arguments. He rarely attempted to interact with girls, but once reluctantly dated a girl named Linda to please his mother.

After dropping out of high school in 1966, Bonin molested several neighborhood children. His mother reportedly refused to acknowledge these acts, or his escalating antisocial behavior, but frequently worried he would be arrested. She prayed for him and warned him often, much to his frustration. Eventually, she evicted him from their house, for undisclosed reasons. 

Lacking motivation, and frequently borrowing money from his parents, Bonin joined the United States Air Force (with his mother&#x27;s encouragement) in December 1966. He became engaged to Linda, a decision largely determined by Bonin&#x27;s mother, who felt it would quell his attraction to pubescent boys. During the engagement, he repeatedly told Linda that he had recurring nightmares about the sexual assault and murder of a young woman.
=== Engagement and U.S. Air Force ===

During his military service, Bonin completed a General Equivalency Diploma, and served as a cook for four months in Alaska. He was arrested for theft on October 25, 1967, but the charges were dropped due to his imminent deployment to Vietnam. Stationed in Phu Loi Base Camp, he served five months of active duty in the 205th Assault Support Helicopter Unit as an aerial gunner, logging over 700 hours of combat and patrol time.

Bonin later claimed that his wartime experiences instilled misanthropic beliefs. Despite this, he is known to have risked his own life on one occasion while under enemy fire to save a wounded fellow airman. For this act, Bonin received a medal in recognition of his gallantry, among other medals. Bonin said he engaged in allegedly consensual relations with four young girls, and had a &quot;number of homosexual encounters&quot; in Vietnam, and once in Hong Kong. He also confessed to sexually assaulting two soldiers under his command at gunpoint, around the time of the Tet Offensive.

Bonin served nearly three years, before receiving an honorable discharge on October 25, 1968, at age 21. Upon returning home, he discovered that Linda, who had given birth to their son, had left him to marry another man. The end of their relationship reportedly left him extremely frustrated. Working as a gas station attendant, Bonin returned to Downey to live with his parents, whom he resented for frequently requesting his help. Several family members noted differences in his behavior after his military service, although Bonin refused to explain these changes.

== First convictions ==
On November 17, 1968, Bonin picked up 14-year-old Billy Jones in Arcadia, California, while driving his mother&#x27;s car. Bonin offered to take him home, but Jones attempted to flee the vehicle in response to Bonin&#x27;s repeated questions regarding homosexuality. Driving him to a nearby shopping center, Bonin handcuffed and raped him, knocking him unconscious in the process. He then dropped Jones off at a park. Returning home, Jones&#x27; mother promptly reported Bonin to police.

On November 26, Bonin picked up 17-year-old hitchhiker John Treadwell of Torrance. Bonin began asking him about &quot;fags&quot; and homosexuality before accelerating the vehicle and producing a handgun. Bonin parked in a secluded area. He then raped Treadwell and bludgeoned him with a tire iron. Bonin threatened that he had friends who would aid in avenging him if Treadwell told &quot;The Man&quot; of what had happened.

On December 4, it was reported to the Torrance Police Department by 17-year-old Allen Pruitt that a man with medium-length dark hair and olive complexion had offered him a ride before deviating from the highway and handcuffing the boy, who was extensively sexually assaulted in the vehicle.

On January 1, 1969, Bonin offered a ride to 12-year-old Lawrence Brettman in Hermosa Beach. Ignoring the boy&#x27;s pleas to let him go, Bonin began threatening Brettman. He parked, and forced Brettman to perform oral sex on him, molesting and robbing him at gun point. He then threatened to kill Brettman if he ever reported the incident.

On January 12, Bonin reportedly picked up 18-year-old hitchhiker Jesus Monge, asking him about homosexuality before offering him twenty dollars to perform oral sex. When Monge attempted to exit the vehicle, Bonin physically and sexually assaulted him. He was then handcuffed and raped. Bonin threatened Monge, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ll rip your nuts off if you don&#x27;t cool it.&quot;

By this point, extensive efforts were being made by local police to locate a potential serial rapist that fit Bonin&#x27;s description. On the 28th an El Segundo policewoman confronted Bonin, who had frightened 16-year-old runaway Timothy Wilson, who was present with Bonin in Bonin&#x27;s mother&#x27;s vehicle, Noting Bonin&#x27;s frantic state and similar profile to the rapist, she searched and handcuffed him. Bonin repeatedly advised her to incarcerate him, before insisting he was not responsible for his actions. He was indicted on five counts of kidnapping, four counts of sodomy, one count of oral copulation, and one count of child molestation against the five individuals he had abducted and assaulted (or attempted to assault) since the previous November.

In March, Bonin underwent two psychiatric examinations, after which he was determined as being a sexual psychopath, who had little control over his impulses and showed signs of depression and inappropriate emotional responses. Initially denying childhood abuse, Bonin confessed to being molested at age eight, and suspected he was molested on various occasions between 9 and 12 years old. In May, Bonin recounted to a probation officer his recent stressful separation, and admitted his guilt in molesting male youths, although he also expressed desire to start a family and become a pilot upon his release. He said that his Vietnam service contributed to his criminal behavior, emphasizing his difficulties in seducing female partners since his return. He was evaluated to be &quot;seriously lacking insight and responsibility&quot; for crimes committed since his childhood. He pleaded guilty to molestation and forced oral copulation, and was sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital in June 1969 as a mentally disordered sex offender considered amenable to treatment.

== Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison ==

Bonin arrived at the Atascadero State Hospital on June 17, 1969; he was subjected to a battery of psychiatric examinations which revealed that he possessed an IQ of 121 and displayed traits of manic depression, sexual sadism disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. A physical examination revealed extensive scars on Bonin&#x27;s head and buttocks, which he claimed to have no memory of obtaining, but were likely sustained in the Franco-American Orphanage. This lack of acknowledgement led experts to conclude Bonin repressed memories of the more extreme aspects of his childhood abuse. They also noted the psychological and emotional implications of Bonin&#x27;s unhealthy relationship with his mother, upon whom he remained emotionally dependent, in spite of her low opinion of him (she considered him &quot;worthless as a human being&quot;).

Bonin regularly attended group therapy sessions while incarcerated. Psychiatrists noted his defensive, aggressive attitude toward other patients, and his refusal to acknowledge his homosexuality. Bonin divulged his intentions to eliminate any future victims of his sexual assaults, if he deemed it necessary. He was classified as an extreme sociopath with a high probability of recidivistic behavior under periods of psychotic breakdown. He was regarded as &quot;extremely disturbed&quot; and his poor social skills with others were also viewed as hindering his own treatment. Despite this, Bonin willingly participated in experimental programs and was generally considered a non-violent, helpful, and conscientious patient by staff. He had recited what he perceived psychiatrists desired to hear from him, believing he could manipulate them into granting him an early release. One psychiatrist wrote of Bonin that he &quot;wanted to straighten himself out, but doesn&#x27;t know how to go about it.&quot;

In 1971, Bonin was sent to the California Medical Facility, having been declared unsuitable for further treatment due to repeated sexual engagement with inmates (two of whom were mentally challenged). This, as well as alienating and irritating fellow patients, resulted in Bonin being beaten on several occasions. Bonin was subject to further psychiatric examination, which dealt with hostility toward his father and older brother. It was noted that his sexual behaviors were compulsive in response to stress. He also sought to raise money for the family of another prisoner, and reportedly applied willingly for at least one treatment program. Bonin was released from prison on June 11, 1974, after doctors concluded he was &quot;no longer a danger to the health and safety of others&quot;.

=== Further offenses and imprisonment ===
In July, Bonin rented an apartment in Hollywood, Los Angeles, with intentions of circulating within the local gay community, but was largely unsuccessful due to poor social skills and soon relocated to his parents&#x27; new house on 10282 Angell Street in Downey. He briefly worked as a bartender in Fountain Valley, and switched to being a truck driver for a Montebello delivery firm named Dependable Drive-Away in December 1974. He was fired from the job in February 1975 for wrecking a trailer. In March, Bonin attended community college classes for two semesters. Around this time, he would pick up hitchhikers for the purposes of having sex, eventually establishing a serious relationship with a single mother.
While cruising for young boys on the night of September 8, 1975, he encountered 14-year-old David Allen McVicker hitchhiking in Garden Grove. McVicker accepted Bonin&#x27;s offer to drive him to his parents&#x27; home in Huntington Beach. Shortly after McVicker entered the car, Bonin asked him if he had engaged in homosexuality. McVicker replied that he had not. He asked to leave the vehicle, which prompted Bonin to accelerate it. When McVicker attempted to leave, Bonin produced a gun and drove him to a deserted field. Bonin ordered him to undress, and then beat and raped him. Bonin strangled him with his T-shirt and a tire iron. McVicker pleaded for his life. Bonin immediately stopped and apologized, before reverting to casual conversation. He then drove McVicker to his home, stating on the way, &quot;You know what? You&#x27;re an alright guy. I was going to kill you but I want to come back for you and use you again.&quot;

Soon, McVicker phoned his mother, who promptly informed Garden Grove police of the incident. On October 11, 1975, Bonin was arrested for two assaults months later. Upon arrest, he informed law enforcement that &quot;next time there won&#x27;t be any more witnesses.&quot; He was charged with the rape and forcible oral copulation of a minor, and the attempted abduction of a 15-year-old boy two days after Bonin&#x27;s assault on McVicker. This second victim rejected Bonin&#x27;s offer of $35 for sex, before exiting Bonin&#x27;s van and telling him to leave. In response, Bonin drove the van onto the sidewalk in an attempt to strike him.

Bonin pleaded guilty to both charges and on December 31, 1975, he was sentenced to serve between one and fifteen years&#x27; imprisonment at the California Men&#x27;s Facility in San Luis Obispo. In 1977, Bonin was subject to further psychiatric examination. It was indicated his sexual involvement with young boys related to his mother&#x27;s micromanagement of his life. In March 1978, Bonin&#x27;s father suffered a major stroke (presumably induced by his alcohol addiction) causing him to be hospitalized at the Long Beach Veterans Administration Hospital, where his mother worked as a vocational nurse. In prison, Bonin completed mathematics courses and training as a machinist, in order to secure employment. He also showed significant progress in individual therapy sessions. As a result, he was released from detention on October 11, with eighteen months&#x27; supervised probation.

== Release ==
On November 1, 1978, Bonin moved to an apartment in the Kingswood Village complex, located approximately one mile from his parents&#x27; house. He became acquainted with his 43-year-old neighbor, Everett Scott Fraser. Bonin became a regular attendee at Fraser&#x27;s parties, where young men, drugs, and alcohol were rife. Fraser considered him a respectful and placid individual and frequently introduced Bonin to his young male acquaintances. The two also talked about their homosexuality. The following month, Bonin established a relationship with a married mother who held a criminal record for child cruelty. He would take trips to Anaheim with her and her kids.

In April 1979, Bonin&#x27;s parole supervision concluded. Later, Bonin and his brother Paul relocated to Silverado, and ran a bar called the Alpine Inn. It was continually under scrutiny for noise violations. An incident occurred involving Bonin reportedly locking a 16-year-old runaway in a room of the building, threatening at knife-point to bury his body in the hills. Unable to obtain a permanent liquor license due to Bonin&#x27;s criminal record, the business venture was short-lived. Later, Bonin purchased a Ford van while working at his older brother&#x27;s plumbing business.

=== Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley ===
Through his frequent attendance at Fraser&#x27;s parties, Bonin became acquainted with 21-year-old Vernon Robert Butts and 18-year-old Gregory Matthews Miley.

Born and raised in Norwalk, Butts was nine years old when his father died, and reportedly hailed from a broken home. Described by acquaintances as &quot;shy and easily led&quot; by others, Butts attempted suicide on three occasions prior to meeting Bonin. At the time of his initial acquaintance with Bonin, Butts had developed a local reputation as an eccentric figure who had recently been fired from his employment as a magic store clerk due to his unkempt appearance and increasingly strange and unpredictable behavior. He was bisexual and frequently abused drugs and alcohol.

Butts was a drifter who had been in and out of penal institutions and held an extensive criminal record for offenses such as burglary and arson. He was later speculated by prosecutors to have developed a fascination with sadistic homosexual activity while incarcerated. He claimed to have been both enamored with and terrified of Bonin, whom he claimed held a &quot;kind of hypnotic&quot; control over him. In contrast, Bonin held Butts in high regard for his social popularity, dominance, and intelligence. Although both lived externally heterosexual lifestyles, the two soon became lovers. Butts also held &quot;Mystery Parties&quot; in which up to sixteen people searched for various murder artifacts in the city of Downey, such as a hairpin or ice pick. As a result, Bonin and Butts frequently discussed the subject of death.

Miley was an illiterate Texas native and high school dropout with an IQ of 56. Raised in Lakewood, Miley&#x27;s mother reportedly had a series of dysfunctional marriages and severely neglected him. Miley viewed Bonin as something of a father figure, and he often spent time with Bonin in exchange for a sexual relationship.

== Murders ==

Bonin usually selected young male hitchhikers, schoolboys or, occasionally, male prostitutes as his victims. The victims, aged 12 to 19, were predominantly Caucasian or Latino, slender, pale, and long-haired. He either enticed or forced them into his Ford Econoline van, where they were overpowered and had their limbs bound with a combination of handcuffs, wire, or cords. They were then sexually assaulted, extensively beaten, and tortured, before typically being killed by strangulation with their own T-shirts and a tire iron.

In order to minimize the chances of a victim escaping from the van, Bonin removed the door handles on the passenger-side and rear-door. He stowed ligatures, knives, pliers, wire coat hangers, and other such instruments in his vehicle to restrain and torture of his victims. The victims were usually killed inside his van, before their bodies were discarded around and near various freeways. In an apparent effort to weaken investigators, Bonin often discarded his victims&#x27; bodies in counties far from their abduction.

One attorney present for Bonin&#x27;s eventual court case said the escalating levels of brutality he had exhibited toward his victims had been similar to that of a drug addict, requiring an ever-greater increase of dosage to maintain their euphoria. Bonin also likened his urges to addiction, emphasizing to neurologists his feelings of extreme restlessness and sexual frustration in the hours prior to his murders, and that he had felt an intense sense of excitement as he drove in search of his victims. Reserving Sundays for his girlfriend, he typically cruised the freeways on Fridays and Saturdays. Bonin also later described his feeling pleasure at hearing his victims scream, and sodomizing them. Dr. Albert Rosenstein, a forensic psychologist, predicted the killer was an intelligent sex offender in his late twenties or early thirties, had spent time in a psychiatric facility, and was abused as a child. He said that, while bisexual, the killer has never been comfortable with their homosexuality, and is repulsed by his actions.

In a minimum of twelve of the murders, Bonin was assisted by one or more of his four known accomplices. Bonin later confessed that he felt a sense of social belonging with his accomplices that he had never experienced with anyone else. Butts is suspected of accompanying or assisting Bonin on at least nine of Bonin&#x27;s murders.

He would scrapbook newspaper clippings of his murders, and boast to Butts and Fraser about them. Following media coverage of the murders, Bonin enthusiastically mentioned them to co-workers at Dependable Drive-Away. To those unaware of his crimes, Bonin seemed obsessed with the case. He made daily trips to Orange County to buy newspapers. He would also tell people, &quot;this guy is giving good gays like us a bad name.&quot;

=== 1979 ===

==== May ====

The first murder for which Bonin was charged was that of 13-year-old Thomas Glen Lundgren. Lundgren was last seen leaving his parents&#x27; house in Reseda on May 28, 1979. Shortly before his abduction, Lundgren had reportedly told friends a man had offered to meet him at a skatepark to take photos of him for a skateboarding magazine.

Lundgren&#x27;s partially-clothed body was found the same afternoon in Agoura. His clothes and severed genitals were discovered in a nearby field. An autopsy revealed that Lundgren had suffered emasculation and extensive bludgeoning. In addition, he had been slashed across the throat, stabbed, and strangled to death. An expert postulated that Bonin&#x27;s brutality was likely an attempt to &quot;silence&quot; his homosexual attraction to Lundgren. Bonin was assisted by Butts.

==== August ====

On August 4, Bonin drove from Silverado Canyon to Westminster to spend time with Butts. He soon suggested that they rape and murder a teenage hitchhiker. Butts was amenable to this suggestion, and Bonin encountered 17-year-old boy Mark Shelton near Beach Boulevard. Bonin offered $400 for sexual services. According to Bonin, he masturbated Shelton before Butts began sexually assaulting him. Bonin drove into Cajon Pass in San Bernardino County, as Shelton had oral sex with him. Bonin soon parked the vehicle and raped him. Enraged with his fear and resistance, Bonin sexually assaulted him, and Bonin and Butts physically assaulted him until he lost consciousness. He was violated with foreign objects, including a stick, causing him to enter a state of shock which proved fatal. He was discarded beside a gravel road in Cajon Pass.
The night of the following day, Bonin and Butts encountered 17-year-old West German student Markus Grabs, attempting to hitchhike from the Pacific Coast Highway. According to Bonin, he engaged in consensual relations with the youth, who agreed to be bound with lengths of cord and ignition wire. Bonin then retrieved a knife, and intimidated Grabs, as Butts drove toward Bonin&#x27;s home. There, Grabs was again raped and beaten, and Grabs reportedly broke loose and punched Bonin. This caused Bonin to strangle him and stab him 77 times. His body was discarded in Malibu Creek the following day.

On August 9, Bonin was again detained for molesting a 17-year-old boy from Dana Point. This violation of the conditions of his parole should have resulted in Bonin being returned to prison at Orange County Jail; however, an administrative error committed prior to Bonin&#x27;s scheduled court date resulted in his release. On August 13, Fraser drove to collect Bonin from jail. He later recollected that as he drove Bonin home, Bonin said, &quot;No one&#x27;s going to testify again. This is never going to happen to me again.&quot; At the time, Fraser had interpreted this as a statement of remorse.

Resuming his murder spree, Bonin did not show at his court appointment. Bonin had also returned to his parents&#x27; house. He gradually developed a reputation as a child molester among local residents, due to his habit of inviting young boys into his house, under the guise of providing alcohol and viewing pornography with them. Some neighbors recalled observing young boys accompany Bonin inside, and they would later hear screaming and crying. Bonin&#x27;s family, who were occasionally present, claimed to have never witnessed Bonin abuse them.

On August 20, Bonin picked up 18-year-old Robert Wirostek in Newport Beach. Bonin allegedly coaxed him to perform oral sex by offering him $50. At knife-point, Bonin bound and raped him, and then drove to Butts&#x27; residence. On the drive, Butts performed oral sex on Wirostek, before striking him and taking Bonin&#x27;s place as driver. Bonin then tortured Wirostek by bending his fingers, then sexually assaulting and bludgeoning him, before strangling him. Wirostek&#x27;s body was found on September 27, alongside Interstate 10.

On August 27, Bonin and Butts abducted 15-year-old Hollywood boy Donald Ray Hyden on Santa Monica Boulevard. Butts was driving the van. Bonin offered him $50 for consensual sex. When Butts made an accidental wrong turn, Hyden became frantic, causing Bonin to beat, bind, torture, and sodomize him. Bonin then strangled him to death. Butts performed oral sex on his corpse before the pair dumped his body at a construction site near the Ventura Freeway. It was discovered hours later. Hyden&#x27;s rectal damage lead to a coroner&#x27;s theory that he had been impaled by a large object.

==== September through December ====
On September 9, Bonin and Butts encountered a 17-year-old boy from La Mirada, David Louis Murillo, cycling. After Murillo entered the van, Bonin offered him money for sex, which was refused. He then attempted to fondle Murillo before binding him and driving to Butts&#x27; residence. As Butts drove, Bonin sexually assaulted and raped him. He then traded places with Butts, who performed oral sex on and beat Murillo. They then parked the vehicle, bound him, and raped him more. He was extensively bludgeoned, then strangled. His body was discovered alongside Highway 101 on the 12th.

Bonin is not known to have killed again until on or about November 1. He and Butts abducted and murdered an unidentified young man with brown hair, whom Bonin claimed to be tall, and 18-years-old. At some point, Bonin allegedly said the man was to die because &quot;your folks paid us to find you and kill you&quot;. The two beat him, and Bonin strangled him to death before inserting an ice pick into his head. His body was discarded alongside State Route 99, south of Bakersfield.

On November 30, an unassisted Bonin abducted 17-year-old Frank Dennis Fox, from Bellflower. Bonin sodomized him and strangled him until he died. His body was found two days later alongside the Ortega Highway, five miles east of San Juan Capistrano. The body bore signs of binding and blunt force trauma. Ten days later, a 15-year-old boy from Long Beach, John Fredrick Kilpatrick, left his home and was offered money for sexual services by Bonin. After engaging in mutual oral sex, Kilpatrick was bound and raped by Bonin before being transported to his parents&#x27; house, where he was flagellated with string, and then strangled to death with it. His body was discarded near Rialto. It was found on December 13, but Kilpatrick remained known as a John Doe until August 5, 1980. Because of his troubled background, which caused him to disappear for days at a time, his mother hesitated to report the disappearance. His friends also mistakenly reported seeing him at the mall. As a result, he was not reported missing until February.

=== 1980 ===

==== January and February ====
On January 1, 1980, Bonin encountered 16-year-old Ontario boy Michael Francis McDonald near the Chino Airport. Under the guise of providing drugs for him to sell, Bonin parked behind an apartment building. In the van, Bonin bound, beat, and raped him. His body was found alongside Highway 71 in the outskirts of Chino, and his body was not identified until March 24.

On the morning of February 3, Bonin invited a 16-year-old boy into his parents&#x27; house to drink and have sex. Bonin allegedly caught him stealing $100 from his billfold, and furiously resolved to commit a murder. Later that evening, he drove to Hollywood with Gregory Miley with the specific intention of committing a murder with him. They encountered 15-year-old Charles Miranda nearby the Starwood nightclub along Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Miley, Bonin and Miranda had consensual sex in the van as he drove. Bonin then told Miley that Miranda was going to die. Miley asked why Bonin would not just let him go. Bonin replied, &quot;because he&#x27;ll know us and know the van.&quot; Bonin beat, bound, and gagged Miranda, and informed him that he had to be killed due to his earlier robbery. Miranda began begging for his life. Bonin began sexually assaulting Miranda, and Miley unsuccessfully attempted to rape him. In frustration, the two started physically assaulting him and Bonin strangled him to death. His body was later dumped in a Los Angeles alleyway.

Five minutes after discarding the body, Bonin suggested to Miley to &quot;do another one&quot;. Miley initially protested and stated he wanted to go home, but eventually complied. A few hours later, in Huntington Beach, the pair encountered 12-year-old James Macabe. Macabe had been dropped off at a corner bus stop by his older brother, who had given him money to take the bus to Disneyland. He was lured into Bonin&#x27;s van on the promise he would be driven to his intended destination, and that he would be given marijuana.

According to Miley, Macabe got in the van, and Bonin drove to a grocery store. Bonin parked the van, and began hugging and kissing Macebe, before binding him, and telling him he was being kidnapped for ransom. Bonin began punching him, and as Miley drove around, Bonin raped him and bludgeoned him with a tire iron. Bonin then forced him to sleep in his arms. Upon Macabe&#x27;s waking, Miley and Bonin beat him into unconsciousness, and Bonin crushed his neck with a tire iron. Bonin then strangled Macabe to death, and he and Miley discarded the corpse at a construction site in Walnut. Macabe&#x27;s body was discovered three days later. The next day, Bonin was arrested for violating the conditions of his parole; he was remanded in custody at the Orange County Jail until March 4.

==== March ====
Following his release, he was hired as a truck driver at Dependable Drive-Away. Bonin angered his boss (who was unaware of his status as a sex offender) by picking up hitchikers in his presence on one occasion, and by taking long, unnecessary routes (which detectives later took interest in). On March 14, Bonin abducted 18-year-old Van Nuys man Ronald Gatlin. Bonin beat and sodomized him, and hacked at him with an ice pick. The following day, his bound body was found behind an industrial building.

On March 21, Bonin offered a ride to 14-year-old hitchhiker Glenn Norman Barker. Barker was beaten and raped with objects, then strangled with a ligature, burned with a cigarette and had his rectum distended. Later that day, 15-year-old Russell Duane Rugh was abducted in Garden Grove. He was bound, beaten, and strangled to death, after an estimated eight hours of captivity. The two boys&#x27; bodies were discarded in Cleveland National Forest, close to the Ortega Highway, and found on the 23rd.

One Friday evening in March, Bonin offered 17-year-old William Ray Pugh a ride home, as the pair left Fraser&#x27;s residence. Pugh accepted, and during the ride, Bonin asked him to have sex. According to Pugh, he attempted to leave the van once Bonin had slowed down at a stoplight. Bonin grabbed him, dragged him back inside, and admitted that he enjoyed abducting, restraining, torturing, and strangling hitchhikers. Bonin then informed Pugh how to murder without getting caught. Bonin said that he had chosen to refrain from sexually assaulting and murdering Pugh not out of sentiment, but because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser&#x27;s party together. Pugh was driven to what he claimed was his home, and when the van left, he ran to his house.

Pugh kept associating with Bonin. On March 25, Bonin and Pugh abducted 15-year-old runaway Harry Todd Turner from a Los Angeles street. Turner had escaped a boys&#x27; home in Lancaster four days prior. Pugh later testified that he and Bonin lured Turner into Bonin&#x27;s van with an offer of $20 for sex. After binding and sodomizing Turner, Bonin bit into his penis until it tore, and then ordered Pugh to beat him up. After Pugh bludgeoned and beat him, Bonin strangled him to death. His body was discarded behind a Los Angeles business.

==== April ====
On April 10, Bonin was discharged from parole. He encountered 16-year-old Bellflower youth Steven John Wood walking to school. Wood&#x27;s older brother had introduced him to Bonin, so he willingly entered Bonin&#x27;s van. His hogtied body was discarded in a Long Beach alleyway, close to the Pacific Coast Highway. Bonin allegedly waited until dusk to discard it. Wood&#x27;s autopsy revealed he had been killed by strangulation.

On April 29, Bonin encountered 19-year-old Darin Kendrick at his workplace in Stanton. Bonin lured Kendrick into the van on the pretext of selling him drugs. Bonin then drove to Butts&#x27; apartment in Lakewood. There, he asked Kendrick whether he was gay. Kendrick attempted to flee; Bonin and Butts bound him, and Butts sodomized him. Bonin raised the volume of Butts&#x27; sound system to cover Kendrick&#x27;s screams. Butts then held Kendrick&#x27;s mouth open while Bonin poured chloral hydrate down his throat, causing him to sustain caustic chemical burns.
Kendrick fought his attackers, but stopped, before complaining of dizziness. Bonin then strangled him, and Butts drove an ice pick into his ear, fatally wounding his cervical spinal cord. His body was discarded behind a warehouse close to the Artesia Freeway.

==== May ====
On May 12, Bonin abducted and murdered an acquaintance of his; he later stated that he decided to kill them when he had awoken that morning, because he was &quot;tired of having him around&quot;. The body of 17-year-old Lawrence Sharp was discarded behind a Westminster gas station. His body was found on the 18th, and his autopsy revealed that he had been bound, sodomized, beaten, and strangled.

On May 19, Bonin asked Butts to accompany him on a killing. However, Butts reportedly refused. Unassisted, Bonin abducted 14-year-old South Gate boy Sean King in Downey. King was strangled to death before his body was discarded in Yucaipa. Bonin then visited Butts&#x27; apartment and bragged to him about the murder.

By early 1980, Bonin&#x27;s murders were receiving considerable media attention, and leading gay rights activists had offered a reward totaling $50,000 for information leading to the conviction of the suspect or suspects. Having by this stage determined a definitive link between many of the recent murders, investigators from the jurisdictions where victims had been abducted or discovered had begun sharing information in their hunt for the suspect or suspects. Six officers from three of the jurisdictions formed a task force dedicated to their apprehension.

By May, Pugh had been arrested for auto theft. On May 28, he overheard the details of the ongoing murders on a local radio broadcast, and confided to a counselor that he knew the perpetrator&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot;, which was described to him by Bonin two months prior. This counselor reported Pugh&#x27;s suspicions to the police, who in turn relayed a confidential tip to Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) homicide sergeant John St. John. St. John conducted an extensive interview with Pugh the next day. Although Pugh withheld the fact that he had accompanied Bonin on one of his murders, the information he provided led St. John to deduce that Bonin might be the Freeway Killer.

That same day, Bonin invited 18-year-old homeless drifter James Michael whom he had encountered while cruising for young male prostitutes⁠to move into his family&#x27;s home in exchange for sex. Munro was a runaway from St. Clair, Michigan, who had been evicted from his family&#x27;s home in early 1980. Munro had gone to California to meet a friend, but became homeless after he was robbed of money that he earned as a male prostitute in Hollywood.

==== June ====
While at Bonin&#x27;s home, Munro (who was bisexual) began a consensual sexual relationship with him. He accepted an offer of employment at Dependable Drive-Away. Munro later described his initial impression of Bonin as being &quot;a good guy&quot; and &quot;really normal&quot;. On June 1, Bonin informed Munro that he wanted them both to abduct, sexually assault, and murder a hitchhiker.

A police investigation into Bonin&#x27;s background revealed his extensive history of convictions for sexually assaulting teenage boys. St. John assigned a surveillance team to monitor his movements. They began surveilling Bonin on the evening of June one hour prior to Bonin and Munro discarding the body of Bonin&#x27;s final victim. Hours earlier, Bonin and Munro encountered 18-year-old Steven Jay Wells on El Segundo Boulevard. Bonin and Munro enticed him into the van. According to the pair, upon learning Wells was bisexual, Bonin had consensual sex with Wells, before persuading him to go to his parents&#x27; house. There, the two continued having sex. Later, Bonin paid Wells $200 to allow himself to be bound with clothesline. Wells became suspicious of their intentions, and frantic. Bonin retreated to the kitchen, telling Munro they were both going to kill Wells. They then gagged and beat him in a hallway. Wells pleaded for his life, but Bonin strangled him to death. Bonin ordered Munro to retrieve a cardboard box, which the two placed Wells&#x27; body inside of, and carried to Bonin&#x27;s van.

Later, while driving to Butts&#x27; apartment Bonin informed Munro that he, Butts, and others had committed many of the &quot;Freeway Killer&quot; murders. At the apartment, Bonin invited Butts to view Wells&#x27; body in the van. Bonin then asked where he should dispose of the corpse. Munro later testified that Butts dissuaded Bonin from discarding it in the nearby canyons, and recommended discarding him near a gas station. They drove to a disused gas station in Huntington Beach, and discarded him there. The body was discovered five hours later, by two brothers who had parked nearby. Bonin and Munro returned to Bonin&#x27;s house. Later that night, Bonin hinted to Munro (who was fearful for his life) that he should stay quiet regarding Wells&#x27; murder, or else face potential death.

== Arrest ==
After nine days of uneventful surveillance, on June 11, plainclothes police observed Bonin driving throughout Hollywood, unsuccessfully attempting to lure five separate boys into his van, before succeeding in luring one. The police followed Bonin until he parked at a service station close to the Hollywood Freeway, then discreetly approached the vehicle. Upon hearing screams and banging sounds coming from inside the van, the officers forced their way inside. They discovered Bonin raping 17-year-old Orange County runaway Harold Eugene Tate, whom he had handcuffed and bound.

Bonin was initially charged with the rape of a minor, and held on suspicion of Miranda&#x27;s murder. He was detained in lieu of $250,000 bond. Later, Bonin&#x27;s girlfriend notified his boss of his arrest, adding that the arrest was in connection to the Freeway Killer case. This caused Munro (who was already apprehensive at Bonin&#x27;s absence from work that day) to become frantic. The next day, Munro stole Bonin&#x27;s car and fled back to Michigan, where he temporarily resided before being arrested.

Inside Bonin&#x27;s van, investigators discovered numerous artifacts which proved his culpability in the Freeway Killer murders. These included various restraining devices, knives, and a tire iron. They also noted the removed door handles. A forensic examination of the van and Bonin&#x27;s home revealed extensive traces of bloodstains. Inside the glove box, investigators discovered a scrapbook of newspaper clippings related to the murders. Bonin&#x27;s 61-year-old father died of cirrhosis of the liver on October 11, 1980, four months after Bonin&#x27;s arrest. His condition sourced from his excessive alcohol addiction.

=== Confession ===

Although initially alleging his innocence in the murders, Bonin confessed his guilt to St. John after reading a letter from Sean King&#x27;s mother, imploring him to reveal the location of her son&#x27;s body. Bonin made sure to clarify, however, that it was not to ease the mother&#x27;s pain, but on the knowledge that, because King was buried in San Bernardino County, police would likely buy him a hamburger for lunch on the extensive trip.

Over the course of several evenings, Bonin confessed to abducting, raping, and killing 21 young men and boys in graphic detail. He expressed no remorse for his actions, but showed extreme embarrassment and regret over being caught. An Orange County investigator recalled that there &quot;was not a policeman in that room that did not want to kill Bonin&quot; for his confession. Bonin stated that his primary accomplice in the murders had been Butts, while Miley and Munro were accomplices in other murders.

Bonin was physically linked to many of the murders by blood and semen stains. Numerous carpet fibers found upon seven of the victims&#x27; bodies were a precise match with the carpeting in Bonin&#x27;s van. Furthermore, on three bodies, investigators found hair samples which were a precise match with Bonin. Medical evidence revealed that six of the murders for which he was charged were committed by a unique windlass strangulation method, which was later referred to by Bonin&#x27;s prosecutor as &quot;a signature&quot; or &quot;a trademark&quot;.

Initially formally arraigned for the murder of Grabs on July 25, by July 29, Bonin had been charged with an additional 15 murders to which he had confessed, and upon which the prosecution believed they had sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction. In addition to the 16 murder indictments, he was also charged with 11 counts of robbery, one count of sodomy, and one count of mayhem. He was held without bond.

Bonin was not brought to trial for the murders of Mark Shelton, Robert Wirostek, John Kilpatrick, Michael McDonald, or the November 1979 John Doe, because police did not find sufficient evidence linking him alone to the crimes. This is despite Bonin confessing to the murders of Kilpatrick and McDonald.

On August 8, all charges were formally submitted against Bonin. Three days later, attorney Earl Hanson was appointed as his legal representative. He remained Bonin&#x27;s attorney until October 1981, when, at Bonin&#x27;s request, he was replaced by William Charvet and Tracy Stewart.

=== Accomplices&#x27; arrest ===

Based on Bonin&#x27;s confession, police obtained a warrant authorizing a search of Butts&#x27; Lakewood property on the same date as Bonin&#x27;s initial arraignment; this July 25 search uncovered evidence linking Butts to several murders which Bonin had already confessed to. Butts was brought before a Municipal Court on July 29, and charged with accompanying Bonin on six murders, and with three counts of robbery. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department told the press: &quot;Bonin and Butts are believed to be responsible for the kidnapping, torture and murder of at least 21 young males between May 1979 and June 1980&quot;, 14 of which had been committed in their jurisdiction.

Despite initially proclaiming his innocence, Butts soon confessed to having accompanied Bonin upon each of the murders he was charged with, and to have sexually abused several victims. Butts claimed to have participated in the murders primarily out of fear, claiming, &quot;It was either go, or become the next victim&quot;, adding he only found the courage to confess upon learning Bonin was in custody. Butts was adamant he had had only a limited role in the victims&#x27; torture, but confessed to actively torturing one of them. He claimed that, upon their successfully luring a victim into the van, he would typically drive a short distance, before stopping the vehicle in order to assist Bonin in restraining and torturing their captive. He claimed his participation in the murders was typically limited to restraining the victims, but he admitted to mutilating one victim with a wire coat hanger. He said that some victims had been subjected to more extensive blunt force trauma than others because Bonin would escalate the beatings if the victim resisted his sexual advances.

Butts rejected an offer to plead guilty to all charges filed against him in exchange for a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years before the possibility of parole. He did not agree to accept any form of plea bargain, or to testify against Bonin. He was brought before Orange County Municipal Court Judge Richard Orozco on November 14, 1980, where he was formally charged with participating in three further murders committed in the county. His trial was scheduled for July 27, 1981.

On July 31, 1980, Munro was arrested in his hometown, Port Huron, Michigan. He was extradited to California, and charged with Wells&#x27; murder. He pleaded innocent to all charges against him on August 14. Miley, who was in Texas, discussed his role in the Miranda and Macabe murders in a recorded phone conversation with a friend, thus substantiating Bonin&#x27;s earlier confession. On August 22, Miley was arrested, and he was charged by California authorities with the murders of Miranda and Macabe. On December 18, he pleaded not guilty to two charges of first-degree murder, but at two pretrial hearings in May 1981, he pleaded guilty.

First-degree murder charges were brought against the 20-year-old acquaintance of Bonin, Eric Marten Wijnaendts, in December 1980. After police learned Pugh had willingly accompanied Bonin in Harry Todd Turner&#x27;s murder, Wijnaendts&#x27; charges were dropped in January 1981, with the county prosecutor citing insufficient evidence as the cause.

== Preliminary hearings ==
At a preliminary hearing held in Los Angeles County before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Julius Leetham on January 2, 1981, Bonin formally pleaded innocent to 14 first-degree murder charges and numerous counts of sodomy, robbery and mayhem. In eleven of these indictments, a felony-murder-robbery special circumstance was also alleged. Bonin was ordered to return to court on January 7 for pretrial motions and the formal setting of a trial date.

On the 7th, Butts was arraigned on five counts of murder, and three counts of robbery. By this point, he had been listed as an accomplice in the murders of Lundgren, Shelton, Grabs, Hyden, Murillo, Wirostek, Kendrick, Wells, and the November 1979 John Doe. Four days after his formal plea, he committed suicide by hanging himself with a towel in his cell. He had attempted suicide at least four times prior to his arrest; his attorney, Joe Ingber, theorized that his depressive state had been magnified by the impending release of transcripts of his client&#x27;s testimony at the preliminary hearing, in which Butts had graphically described his victims&#x27; torture. He was worried about the effect it would have on his friends and family. The suicide rendered Butts&#x27; recorded testimony in three cases inadmissible as evidence. The charges against Bonin in relation to Shelton, Wirostek and the John Doe were therefore dropped in early 1981. 

Both Miley and Munro agreed to testify against Bonin in court in exchange for being spared the death penalty, and the dismissal of additional charges of sodomy and robbery filed against Munro. In the case of Miley, Norris agreed to accept two separate pleas of guilty to first-degree murder. This was in exchange for two concurrent sentences of life imprisonment, with a possibility of parole after 25 years if Miley agreed to testify against Bonin at both upcoming trials. William Pugh also agreed to testify, having pleaded guilty to one count of voluntary manslaughter, for which he later received six years in prison.

== Murder trials ==

=== Los Angeles County ===
On October 19, Bonin was brought to trial in Los Angeles County, charged with the murder of 12 of his victims whose bodies had been found within this constituency. He was tried before Superior Court Judge William Keene. The trial commenced on November 5.

Norris, acting as prosecutor, sought the death penalty for each count of murder for which Bonin was tried. Norris described Bonin&#x27;s routine and technique with regards to his victims&#x27; torture, and how he would reach the &quot;climax of the orgy&quot; by killing them. He asserted that Bonin murdered as a group sport, with accomplices that he had groomed because of their &quot;low mentality&quot;. Miley and Munro testified against Bonin, describing their murders in graphic detail. Miley testified to his participation in the murders of Miranda and Macabe, describing how the two victims were beaten and tortured before being murdered. He said that Bonin had pressed a tire iron against Miranda&#x27;s neck, and Miley &quot;jumped down on him&quot;, killing him.

The strategy of Charvet and Stewart was to challenge the credibility of the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses, and to suggest that significant mitigating factors as to the causes of Bonin&#x27;s behavior lay in the extensive physical, sexual, and emotional abuse he had endured throughout his early life. They summoned Dr. David Foster, an expert on the developmental effects of abuse on children, to testify as to the conclusions of his psychological examinations of Bonin. He opined that as a result of repeated abandonment as a child, Bonin had not received the nurturing, protection, and behavioral feedback necessary for sufficient psychological development. He said the abuse of Bonin had been so consistent and prevalent that he was confused as to the differences between violence and love.

In a direct rebuttal, the prosecution summoned forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, a noted expert in impulse control disorder and sexual sadism disorder, who testified that Bonin&#x27;s behavior was inconsistent with an inability to control his impulses, and that his actions were reflective of planning as opposed to impulsive behavior. He concluded that Bonin was a sexual sadist, and that although he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, neither of these conditions had impaired his ability to control his actions.

On November 24, prison inmate Lloyd Douglas testified that Bonin had bragged to him of his culpability in the Freeway Killer murders, while both were in Los Angeles County Jail in 1980. Douglas then alleged salacious details regarding Bonin&#x27;s torture of victims that were otherwise not supported with valid evidence. In cross-examination, Douglas conceded he had only related these claims to authorities after pleading guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and second-degree burglary against him. He also testified to being Lawrence Sharp&#x27;s cousin.

Against overruled objections from the defense, Fresno-based reporter David López waived his previously sought immunity under California&#x27;s shield law, and agreed to testify on behalf of the prosecution as to the details of seven interviews Bonin had granted him (between December 1980 and April 1981). López testified that Bonin had said he would refuse to talk with any other reporter if López would agree not to broadcast the precise details of the interview. When López had agreed to these conditions, Bonin confessed to him that he was the Freeway Killer, and that he had killed 21 victims. Allegedly, Bonin had confided that although he resented the prospect of being executed, he had opted to commit murder simply because he had enjoyed the &quot;sound of kids dying&quot;. When López asked Bonin what he would be doing if he were still at large, Bonin had replied he would still be killing, because &quot;it got easier with each one we did.&quot;

Upon cross-examination, Bonin&#x27;s defense attorney ensured that López conceded that his testimony was based upon what he had recalled from the interviews, as opposed to any handwritten notes. He also denied he had received any form of payment to testify.

==== Closing arguments ====
Closing arguments were in late December. Norris described Bonin as someone who derived extreme pleasure from his victims&#x27; suffering, and that he acted with malice aforethought. Norris outlined the torture Bonin&#x27;s victims had endured, before concluding his closing arguments by urging the jury to &quot;give him what he has earned&quot;.

Charvet did not specifically ask the jurors to find Bonin not guilty, instead requesting they only return the &quot;reasonable verdict you can bring&quot;. This indicated a likelihood of not guilty verdicts on at least some counts Bonin was charged with. Charvet doubted the credibility of some of Miley and Munro&#x27;s testimony; he emphasized their turning state&#x27;s evidence made them tailor their testimony to the desires of the police. He reminded the jury he had exposed inconsistencies in Munro&#x27;s account of Wells&#x27; murder, that Munro lied on numerous occasions, that Bonin had been extensively abused as a child, and of the diagnoses the doctors in Atascadero had reached. He said the prosecution&#x27;s case was &quot;full of holes&quot;, and alleged they had resorted to &quot;revulsion tactics&quot;, in the hope Bonin would be convicted upon that basis.

==== Conviction ====
On December 28, the jury formally began their deliberations. On January 6, 1982, they convicted Bonin of ten of the murders for which he was tried. He was found not guilty of the murders of Lundgren and King, of committing sodomy upon Grabs, of committing mayhem upon Lundgren, and of robbing one other victim. Later, the prosecution and defense made alternate pleas for the actual sentence the jury should decide, with Norris requesting the death penalty and Charvet requesting life imprisonment. The jury further found that the special circumstances required within California state law (multiple murders and robbery) had been met in the cases for which Bonin was found guilty, and thus unanimously recommended he receive the death penalty.

Bonin was cleared of King&#x27;s sodomy and murder, because he had led police to King&#x27;s body in 1980 under the agreement that his doing so could not be used against him in court. Therefore, the prosecutors had discussed King&#x27;s disappearance at the trial, but not the discovery of his body. He was cleared of the charges of mayhem and murder against Lundgren because, according to López, he had strenuously denied committing this particular killing in their interviews.

==== Sentencing ====
In February, Charvet argued against imposition of the death verdict returned by the jury. Despite his impassioned appeal, Keene formally sentenced Bonin to death for the ten murders, and ordered that if his death sentence were commuted to one of life imprisonment, the sentences should run consecutively. Bonin was then ordered to await his execution via the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison. He remained unmoved upon learning of the sentence, having earlier informed his attorney he fully expected to receive the death penalty.

Prior to his scheduled second trial in Orange County, Bonin was temporarily removed from death row and held in solitary confinement, where he remained until the conclusion of this trial. This was largely due to the fact he had previously received a severe beating by an incarcerated gang member with whom he had shared a cell. While Bonin was in solitary confinement, Charvet attempted to secure a change of venue, saying the extensive pretrial publicity surrounding the case in Orange County would minimize the chances of securing an untainted jury within the jurisdiction. This motion was refused by Judge Kenneth Lae, who ruled in November that there had only been minimal publicity surrounding Bonin&#x27;s case in Orange County following his earlier convictions.

=== Orange County ===
Bonin was brought to trial in Orange County on March 21, 1983. He was charged with the robbery and murder of four further victims whose bodies had been found within the jurisdiction. He was tried before Superior Court Judge Kenneth Lae. Two hundred and four prospective jurors were subjected to &quot;voir dire&quot; jury selection, until sixteen were picked in June. Bonin&#x27;s attorney then renewed an earlier filed motion that the trial should be moved outside of Orange County due to pretrial publicity tainting the jury pool. This motion was again rejected by Judge Lae, who ruled that the trial would begin on June 14.

The prosecutor, Bryan Brown, contended that all four victims killed within the constituency had been abducted while hitchhiking, then ordered to strip before being bound, raped, beaten, tortured, and strangled. In each instance, the ligature had left an impression upon the victim&#x27;s neck. He also noted similarities in each murder, and between these and two of those for which Bonin had earlier been convicted in Los Angeles County: Miranda and Wells. Emphasis was placed upon the fibers found upon each of the Orange County and three Los Angeles County being a precise match to the carpeting in Bonin&#x27;s van. As such, Brown stated, the four Orange County victims had been killed by the same individual who had killed Miranda and Wells, and his accomplices in the Miranda and Wells murders, Miley and Munro, would testify as to their participation. The prosecution presented forensic experts who testified on the matching fibers, and blood found in the van.

Charvet refuted these contentions, saying that any similarities in &quot;modus operandi&quot; did not automatically prove his client&#x27;s guilt, and that the evidence presented did not support the prosecution&#x27;s contention, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Bonin had murdered any of the four Orange County victims, or the two Los Angeles County victims. Charvet attacked the credibility of Munro, and contended Bonin was simply a scapegoat for four unsolved murders. He also argued that Brown had &quot;spent more time discussing the two Los Angeles cases&quot; Bonin had been convicted for more than actually proving Bonin had committed any of the Orange County murders.

During the six-week trial, Bonin&#x27;s attorneys called two witnesses in his defense. One of them was Munro, who conceded Bonin had communicated with him prior to his testifying in this second trial, requesting that he lie when testifying.

==== Second conviction ====
On August 1, both counsels delivered their closing arguments, and the jury retired. They deliberated for less than three hours, before announcing on the 2nd that they had found Bonin guilty of each count of murder and robbery. After three days deliberating Bonin&#x27;s penalty, on August 22, the jury announced their recommendations that he be sentenced to death on each count. On August 26, Bonin received four further death sentences. Following these convictions, Bonin was transferred from the Orange County jail back to San Quentin State Prison, to await execution via the gas chamber.

== Death row ==

In his years on death row, Bonin undertook painting and writing. He wrote a series of short stories called &quot;Doing Time: Stories from the Mind of a Death Row Prisoner&quot;. He became close friends with convicted murderers Lawrence Bittaker, Randy Kraft (who shared the nickname &quot;Freeway Killer&quot;), Douglas Clark, and Jimmy Lee Smith. He also corresponded with numerous individuals, including the mothers of some of his victims. To the mothers, he never expressed regret or remorse over the murders, purposefully withholding information his victims&#x27; families sought, and seemingly deriving pleasure from their discontent. Bonin once informed the mother of Sean King that her son had been his favorite victim as &quot;he was such a screamer&quot;.

Bonin told both his defense attorneys and several people with whom he corresponded that Butts had been the actual ringleader behind the murders, and that he had simply been Butts&#x27; accomplice. These claims would be refuted by prosecutor Stirling Norris at Bonin&#x27;s Los Angeles County murder trial, who said before Bonin&#x27;s execution: &quot;He was the leader, and he chose weak people he could use.&quot;

Bonin was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in 1992, following the execution of Robert Alton Harris (the first inmate California had executed since 1967). Harris had exhibited evident symptoms of discomfort, including convulsions, for up to four minutes throughout his 15 minutes in the gas chamber. As such, the state of California opted to use lethal injection as an alternate execution method, branding the gas chamber as &quot;cruel and unusual&quot;.

=== Appeals ===
Bonin filed numerous appeals against his convictions and sentencing, citing issues such as jury prejudice, the potential of jury inflammation via listening to numerous victim impact statements (to which his defense counsel had offered to stipulate), and inadequate defense. For these appeals, Bonin hired new lawyers, who initially submitted contentions that Charvet had provided inadequate defense at his trials, by failing to place sufficient emphasis upon Bonin&#x27;s bipolar disorder and childhood sexual abuse. These lawyers contended that, had Charvet placed further emphasis on these issues, Bonin would have been &quot;humanized&quot; in the eyes of his juries. Each successive appeal proved unsuccessful.

Despite upholding the convictions, the Supreme Court poured scorn upon Judge Keene for failing to fully heed a warning given by the prosecution prior to the Los Angeles County trial, that Munro had discussed the possibility of agreeing to legal representation by Charvet prior to his testimony. Despite admonishing Charvet for a potential conflict of interest, Judge Keene had permitted him to act as Bonin&#x27;s defense attorney at his first trial. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that Charvet had effectively cross-examined Munro at trial, and that Keene&#x27;s actions, though &quot;inexplicable&quot;, had not effectively harmed Bonin&#x27;s legal defense. Merit was given to Bonin&#x27;s contention that his defense should have been allowed to stipulate to the testimony of the victims&#x27; parents, rather than their being allowed to identify photographs of their sons in both life and death at his trials. Despite this ruling, this finding was also deemed not to have affected the overall verdict.

A final submission to the United States Court of Appeals was submitted in 1994. Bonin contended issues such as his being denied the effective assistance of counsel at his trials, that he had been denied due process at his Los Angeles trial due to the judge&#x27;s refusal to suppress Munro and Miley&#x27;s testimonies, that Charvet failed to point out Bonin&#x27;s brain damage and other mitigating circumstances, and that the judge at his Orange County trial had denied his counsel&#x27;s motion for a change of venue upon the basis that pretrial publicity had effectively minimized any chance of obtaining an unbiased jury. This appeal was rejected in 1995, with the appellate judges stating they had found no evidence of legal misconduct, and that no evidence existed that the 13 jurors who served upon the Orange County trial had been incapable of judging Bonin with impartiality. As such, the judges declared their satisfaction with Bonin&#x27;s convictions, concluding that his verdict would not have changed with further mitigating circumstances revealed.

The various experts who had examined Bonin would find conflict with one another&#x27;s assertions, with Dr. Park Dietz opining that fellow Dr. Foster largely mischaracterized and exaggerated the evidence used to prove Bonin was extensively abused as a child, and mistakenly assumed Bonin&#x27;s Babinski reflex and other symptoms were indicative of brain damage that influenced his crimes. On February 20, 1996, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Bonin&#x27;s plea for clemency on the grounds of inadequate legal representation at both trials.

== Execution ==
Bonin was executed by lethal injection inside the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison on February 23, 1996, 14 years after his first death sentence had been imposed. He was the first person to be executed by lethal injection in the history of California.

In his final interview, given to a local radio station less than 24 hours before his death, Bonin said that he had &quot;made peace&quot; with the fact he was about to die, adding that his only major regret in life was that he had not pursued his teenage passion of bowling long enough to turn professional. He expressed his disagreement with the State&#x27;s decision to execute him, saying he thought the death penalty is wrong. He denied responsibility for his actions, saying that he had no control over his actions. He also said he would not be able to live a normal life outside prison.

At 6 p.m. on the 23rd, Bonin was moved from his cell to a death-watch cell, where he ordered his last meal: two large pizzas, three pints of ice cream and three six-packs of Coca-Cola. His last hours were spent with five people he had chosen, including his attorney, his chaplain, and a prospective biographer. His attorney said that he had not detected any remorse in Bonin.

Around one hour prior to his scheduled execution, the Supreme Court refused to hear Bonin&#x27;s final plea to overturn his death sentence, deciding that Bonin&#x27;s attorneys had not failed to give him adequate legal representation by not earlier submitting claims of discovered evidence attesting to Bonin&#x27;s innocence. The Court of Appeals ruled that his attorneys should not have waited until the last minute to submit arguments to overturn or postpone the death sentence. They also rejected Bonin&#x27;s claim that he had a right to choose between the gas chamber or lethal injection as his method of execution.

At 11:45 p.m., Bonin was escorted from his holding cell into the execution chamber. In his final statement, given to the prison warden an hour before his scheduled execution at midnight, Bonin again expressed no remorse for his crimes; he left a note that stated:

Bonin was pronounced dead at 12:13 a.m. He was 49. None of Bonin&#x27;s relatives chose to witness his execution, although the event was witnessed by several relatives of his victims. According to several witnesses, Bonin&#x27;s execution passed without complications, and he was heavily sedated throughout the latter stages of the procedure. On this subject, Governor Pete Wilson, who had rejected a submitted plea for clemency from Bonin&#x27;s attorneys three days before the execution, called Bonin the &quot;poster boy for capital punishment&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Bonin&#x27;s family refused to claim his remains following his execution. His remains were cremated in a private ceremony with none of his family members present, and his ashes were later scattered over the Pacific Ocean. Three weeks after the execution, authorities discovered that his mother had openly exploited an administrative error pertaining to her son&#x27;s social security disability which Bonin had begun receiving for a mental disability in 1972 and which should have terminated upon his 1982 to maintain payments on her Downey home. This administrative error (totaling approximately $79,424) was only discovered after a funeral director notified the Social Security Administration of Bonin&#x27;s death. His mother agreed to pay restitution for receiving these payments in March, claiming neither she nor her son were aware of the illegality of their actions.

Throughout Bonin&#x27;s trials, and in the years of his subsequent incarceration on death row, experts devoted much speculation and debate as to whether the root cause of his crimes lay in his abusive and dysfunctional upbringing. One of Bonin&#x27;s lawyers was quoted stating it was &quot;virtually impossible for [Bonin] to be a successful human being&quot; given the abuse he had endured, while a prospective biographer said he was essentially unable to handle minute problems in his day-to-day life due to trauma. Opponents and advocates of the death penalty alike acknowledged Bonin had endured extensive abuse throughout his childhood, but much scorn was given to the claims from his attorneys and supporters that his murders had been a direct manifestation of the abuse.

David McVicker , who witnessed Bonin&#x27;s execution, was traumatized by his ordeal for several years. He was haunted by nightmares on a nightly basis concerning the incident, dropped out of high school and became dependent on drugs and alcohol. He described the execution as being symbolic of closure. In the following years, he actively campaigned to ensure that his accomplices, Miley and Munro, remain incarcerated.&quot;

Munro was sentenced to a term of 15 years to life for the second degree murder of Wells in 1981. He has repeatedly appealed the sentence, claiming that he had not known Bonin was the Freeway Killer until after Wells&#x27; murder, and that he had been tricked into accepting a plea bargain whereby he pleaded guilty to this second degree murder charge. He has also written to successive governors, requesting he be executed, rather than undergo life imprisonment for what he claims is &quot;a crime I didn&#x27;t commit&quot;. He has repeatedly been denied parole and is incarcerated at Mule Creek State Prison. He is next available for parole in 2029.

Miley was sentenced to a term of 25 years to life for the first-degree murder of Miranda in 1982. He was informed he would need to serve a minimum of 16 years and eight months before he would be considered for parole. While incarcerated, Miley was frequently reprimanded for violating prison rules. He was later sentenced to a concurrent term of 25 years to life for the abduction and murder of Macabe. On May 25, 2016, Miley died of injuries he had sustained two days previously, when he was attacked by another inmate in an exercise yard at Mule Creek State Prison. At the time, his next scheduled parole hearing was to be held in 2019.

Pugh was sentenced to six years in prison for the voluntary manslaughter of Harry Turner in 1982. He had initially been charged with the first-degree murder of Turner, in addition to companion charges of robbery and sodomy. However, after five days of deliberation, the jury found Pugh guilty of the reduced charge of manslaughter, and innocent of robbery and sodomy. He served less than four years of his sentence, and was released from prison in 1985.

<text>Ole Knutsen Singstad (June 29, 1882 – December 8, 1969) was a Norwegian-American civil engineer best known for his work on underwater vehicular tunnels in New York City. Singstad designed the ventilation system for the Holland Tunnel, which subsequently became commonly used in other automotive tunnels, and advanced the use of the immersed tube method of underwater vehicular tunnel building, a system of constructing the tunnels with prefabricated sections.

He also designed the Lincoln Tunnel, Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, and Queens–Midtown Tunnel. By 1950, Singstad had designed and overseen the construction of more underwater tunnels than all other engineers combined. In 1946, the Triborough Bridge Authority under Robert Moses took over tunnel construction in New York, and Singstad was subsequently sidelined as Moses favored bridges over tunnels.

== Early life ==
Ole Singstad was born at Singstad farm in the Lensvik area of Rissa Municipality (now part of Orkland Municipality in Trøndelag county), Norway. He was the seventh of nine children born to Knut Jacobsen Singstad (17 May 1831 – 24 November 1906) and Anne Mikkelsdatter Auset Singstad (10 July 1843 – 30 April 1947).

In 1898, Singstad attended grammar school in Ålesund. Later, his sister Marie, a midwife, encouraged Singstad to further his education. He studied in Trondheim at the Trondheim Technical School from 1901 to 1905, where he was chairman of the student body.

In 1905, he emigrated to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen in 1911.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
Ole Singstad first worked for the Central Railroad of New Jersey. In 1907, he moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where he worked on railroads and bridges for the Virginian Railway. He returned to New York City and worked at the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, designing tunnels under the Hudson River in 1909–1910, and later spent seven years in charge of work on subways and rail tunnels in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and under the East River. During this time he worked with Clifford Holland for the New York Public Service Commission of the first district of New York.

In 1917–1918, Singstad worked at the Chile Exploration Company, and in 1918–1919, he worked with Barclay, Parsons, and Klapp (now WSP USA, formerly Parsons Brinckerhoff), where he was in charge of designing a rapid-transit system for Philadelphia, and made preliminary designs for a vehicular tunnel under the Delaware River.

=== New York City tunnels ===
Singstad is widely known for work on the underwater road tunnels in New York City and for designing the ventilation system that made long underwater road tunnels possible, first used in the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River. He began working under chief engineer Clifford Milburn Holland in 1915, and he finished directing construction of the Holland Tunnel after the death of Holland in the fall of 1924 and of Holland&#x27;s successor Milton H. Freeman, who died in March 1925.

Singstad also designed the Lincoln Tunnel, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, the latter two as chief engineer of the New York City Tunnel Authority. In this capacity he clashed with Robert Moses, who not just preferred bridges but also sought to consolidate power and eliminate competition in civil engineering politics:

In 1946, the Tunnel Authority was taken over by the Triborough Bridge Authority, forming the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, whereupon Singstad was fired, and the incomplete Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel was finished to specifications by TBTA chief engineer Ralph Smillie, which were mostly based on Singstad&#x27;s original designs. This new design leaked, and the TBTA reverted to Singstad&#x27;s original design. Singstad later claimed that Smillie had caused &quot;excessive&quot; leakage by not using Singstad&#x27;s experimental caulking design to prevent leaks. Smillie denied that the leakage was excessive and that Singstad&#x27;s caulking method had been replaced because that method was actually the cause of the leak.

=== Other work ===
Singstad was instrumental in numerous underwater vehicular tunnels worldwide.

From 1930 to 1933, he designed and led construction of the Waasland tunnel under the Schelde River in Antwerp. The retreating French set explosives in the tunnel when the war began in 1940; the damage was repaired in weeks under German occupation. Later, the Germans tried again to explode the tunnel when they withdrew in 1944, and this time the tunnel was more seriously damaged. The tunnel was inundated with river water, and repairs took several years.

* He consulted on the Posey Tube, the second tube in the world, which used the same ventilation system that he had designed for the Holland Tunnel.
* He consulted on the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel, the third one, designed by fellow Norwegian-American engineer Søren Anton Thoresen, and designed the ventilation system.
* With Thoresen, he designed the Waasland tunnel under the river Scheldt in Antwerp, Belgium. On this project, Singstad designed the lining, the tunnel shield, the ventilation, and the equipment.
* He established the company &quot;Singstad and Kehart Consulting Engineers&quot; in 1945, which with 50 to 60 staff engineers engineered the final design of The Big Walker Mountain Tunnel in Virginia.
* With his firm Singstad and Baillie in New York, he designed the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, which opened in 1957.

Singstad also designed tunnels in Argentina, Canada, Cuba, and Venezuela.

== Pioneering techniques ==

=== Ventilating the Holland Tunnel ===
Thomas Edison had contended it was impossible to ventilate a tunnel with the volume of traffic envisioned for the Holland Tunnel. At the time of its construction, underwater tunnels were a well-established part of civil engineering, but no long vehicular tunnels had been built, as all of the existing tunnels under New York City waterways carried only railroads and subways. These tubes did not have as much of a need for ventilation, since the trains that used the tubes were required to be electrically powered, and thus emitted very little pollution. On the other hand, the traffic in the Holland Tunnel consisted mostly of gasoline-driven vehicles, and ventilation was required to evacuate the carbon monoxide emissions, which would otherwise asphyxiate the drivers. There were very few tunnels at that time that were not used by rail traffic; the most notable of these non-rail tunnels, the Blackwall Tunnel and Rotherhithe Tunnel in London, did not need mechanical ventilation. However, a tunnel of the Hudson River Tunnel&#x27;s length required an efficient method of ventilation, so Chief Engineer Singstad pioneered a system of ventilating the tunnel transversely (perpendicular to the tubes).

In October 1920, General George R. Dyer, the chairman of the New York Tunnel Commission, published a report in which he stated that Singstad had devised a feasible ventilation system for the Hudson River Tunnel. Working with Yale University, the University of Illinois, and the United States Bureau of Mines, Singstad built a test tunnel in the bureau&#x27;s experimental mine at Bruceton, Pennsylvania, measuring over long, where cars were lined up with engines running. Volunteer students were supervised as they breathed the exhaust in order to confirm air flows and tolerable carbon monoxide levels by simulating different traffic conditions, including backups. The University of Illinois, which had hired the only professors of ventilation in the United States, built an experimental ventilation duct at its Urbana campus to test air flows. In October 1921, Singstad concluded that a conventional, longitudinal ventilation system would have to be pressurized to an air flow rate of along the tunnel. On the other hand, the tunnel could be adequately ventilated transversely if the compartment carrying the tube&#x27;s roadway was placed in between two plenums. A lower plenum below the roadway floor could supply fresh air, and an upper plenum above the ceiling could exhaust fumes at regular intervals.

Two thousand tests were performed with the ventilation system prototype. The system was determined to be of sufficiently low cost, relative to the safety benefits, that it was ultimately integrated into the tunnel&#x27;s design. By the time the tunnel was in service, the average carbon monoxide content in both tunnels was 0.69 parts per 10,000 parts of air. The highest recorded carbon monoxide level in the Holland Tunnel was 1.60 parts per 10,000, well below the permissible maximum of 4 parts per 10,000. The public and the press proclaimed air conditions were better in the tubes than in some streets of New York City; after the tunnel opened, Singstad stated that the carbon monoxide content in the tubes were half of those recorded on the streets.

=== Prefabricated tunnel sections ===
During construction of Baltimore Harbor Tunnel from 1955 to 1957, Singstad adopted a cost-saving method for the construction of the tunnel in the river mud. Previously, hydraulic shields or pressurized caissons had been used — with the constant danger of divers suffering the bends, and the necessity for constant diligence. A sunk-tube method had been earlier proposed and used by Olaf Hoff on the Detroit River tunnel and Harlem River Tunnel.

Singstad advanced Hoff&#x27;s ideas and proposed first digging a large ditch in the river bottom and lowering cable-suspended pre-fabricated tunnel sections in length (weighing 23,000 tons each) into the ditch from overhead barges. Interior chambers were filled with water to lower the sections, the sections then aligned, bolted together by divers, the water pumped out, and the tunnels finally covered with earth. This technique was followed in numerous later tunnel projects by other engineers, on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel, for example.

== Personal life ==
Ole Singstad married Else Johansen (June 28, 1890 – July 8, 1964). Together they had two children, Rita (May 2, 1918 – May 3, 1975) and Paul (April 25, 1925 – March 27, 1976).

Singstad returned to Norway five times in his life: first for his mother&#x27;s 80th birthday in 1923, to Lensvik in 1930, and again in 1933 while working on the tunnel at the river Schelde. He missed his mother&#x27;s 100th birthday in 1943 because of World War II, but he returned in 1953 and again a final time in 1967 at age 85, while he was still active in his consulting firm.

He was an avid fisherman.

Singstad died on December 8, 1969. At the time of his death, he lived on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He is buried at the Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

== Honors and awards ==
Singstad received honorary doctorates from the Stevens Institute of Technology of Hoboken, New Jersey; the New York Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn; St. Olaf College of Northfield, Minnesota; and the College of Engineering Newark, New Jersey.

Singstad was elected president of the American Council of Engineering Companies during 1941; he and Søren Anton Thoresen received gold medals and were decorated by King Albert I of Belgium for their work on the Waasland tunnel; a wooden statue has been erected in his honor at Lensvik Samfunnshus; and in 2008, a lecture in his honor was held at the Museum of Modern Art.

Singstad was named 1933 Officer of the Order of the Crown of Belgium, received the 1939 Ridder order of First Class, the 1956 Medal of Honor from the American Society of Engineers and the 1960 Commander of the Order of Merit (Chile).

At age 48, Singstad received the Royal Norwegian Academy of Science Society, an award normally reserved for much older people.

<doc id="1187194" wikidata="Q524475" url="?curid=1187194" title="Congress for Cultural Freedom">
<text>The Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF) was an anti-communist cultural organization founded on 26 June 1950 in West Berlin. At its height, the CCF was active in thirty-five countries. In 1966 it was revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency was instrumental in the establishment and funding of the group. The congress aimed to enlist intellectuals and opinion makers in a war of ideas against communism.

Historian Frances Stonor Saunders writes (1999): &quot;Whether they liked it or not, whether they knew it or not, there were few writers, poets, artists, historians, scientists, or critics in postwar Europe whose names were not in some way linked to this covert enterprise.&quot; Peter Coleman argues that the CCF was a participant in a struggle for the mind &quot;of Postwar Europe&quot; and the world at large.

== Origins, 1948–1950 ==
The CCF was founded on 26 June 1950 in West Berlin, which had just endured months of Soviet blockade. Formation of the CCF came in response to a series of events orchestrated by the Soviet Union: the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace in Wrocław (Poland) in August 1948; a similar event in April the following year in Paris, the World Congress of Peace Partisans; and their culmination in the creation of the World Peace Council, which in March 1950 issued the Stockholm Appeal. As part of this campaign there had also been an event in New York City in March 1949: the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was attended by many prominent U.S. liberals, leftists and pacifists who called for peace with the Soviet Union. Prominent participants included Dmitri Shostakovich and Aaron Copland. Anti-communist opponents to the conference took up residence in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in an attempt to discredit the peace conference. The anti-communists attempted to enlist a range of international supporters for their cause, including Benedetto Croce, T. S. Eliot, Karl Jaspers, André Malraux, Bertrand Russell and Igor Stravinsky.

The founding conference of the Congress for Cultural Freedom was attended by leading intellectuals from the U.S. and Western Europe. Among those who came to Berlin in June 1950 were writers, philosophers, critics and historians: Franz Borkenau, Karl Jaspers, John Dewey, Ignazio Silone, Jacques Maritain, James Burnham, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Bertrand Russell, Ernst Reuter, Raymond Aron, A. J. Ayer, Benedetto Croce, Arthur Koestler, Richard Löwenthal, Melvin J. Lasky, Tennessee Williams, Irving Brown and Sidney Hook. There were conservatives among the participants, but non-Communist (or former Communist) left-wingers were more numerous. Irving Kristol, who would become known as the &quot;godfather of neoconservatism,&quot; was also present. During the Berlin conference, Nicolas Nabokov proclaimed: &quot;With this Congress we must build a war organization&quot;. The Manifesto of the Congress was drafted by Arthur Koestler, with amendments added on a motion proposed by historian Hugh Trevor-Roper and philosopher A. J. Ayer.

== Executive Committee and Secretariat ==
An Executive Committee was elected in 1950 at the founding conference in Berlin, with seven members and six alternate members: Irving Brown (Haakon Lie), Arthur Koestler (Raymond Aron), Eugen Kogon (Carlo Schmid), David Rousset (Georges Altman), Ignazio Silone (Nicola Chiaromonte), Stephen Spender (Tosco Fyvel) and Denis de Rougemont who became President of the committee.

The management of the CCF was entrusted to its secretariat, headed by Michael Josselson. By the time Josselson joined the Congress of Cultural Freedom in 1950 he was &quot;undoubtedly a CIA officer&quot;. A polyglot able to converse fluently in four languages (English, Russian, German and French), Josselson was heavily involved in the CCF&#x27;s growing range of activities – its periodicals, worldwide conferences and international seminars – until his resignation in 1967, following the exposure of funding by the CIA.

== Activities, 1950–1966 ==
At its height, the CCF had offices in 35 countries, employed dozens of personnel, and published over twenty prestigious magazines. It held art exhibitions, owned a news and features service, organized high-profile international conferences, and rewarded musicians and artists with prizes and public performances.

Between 1950 and 1966 the Congress sponsored numerous conferences. A selective list describes 16 conferences in the 1950s held principally in Western Europe, but also in Rangoon, Mexico City, Tokyo, Ibadan (Nigeria) and South Vietnam: the Founding Conference in Berlin was followed in 1951 by the First Asian Conference on Cultural Freedom, held in Bombay. A further 21 conferences over an even wider geographical area are listed for the first half of the 1960s.

In the early 1960s, the CCF mounted a campaign against the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, an ardent communist. The campaign intensified when it appeared that Neruda was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964 but he was also published in &quot;Mundo Nuevo&quot;, a CCF-sponsored periodical. Other prominent intellectuals targeted by the CCF were Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Thomas Mann who was becoming increasingly pro-Soviet. From 1950 to 1969, the CCF financed German writers such as Heinrich Böll and Siegfried Lenz.

== CIA involvement revealed, 1966 ==
In April 1966, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a series of five articles on the purposes and methods of the CIA. The third of these 1966 articles began to detail false-front organizations and the secret transfer of CIA funds to, for example, the US State Department or to the United States Information Agency (USIA) which &quot;may help finance a scholarly inquiry and publication, or the agency may channel research money through foundations – legitimate ones or dummy fronts.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; cited, among others, the CIA&#x27;s funding of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, &quot;Encounter&quot; magazine, &quot;several American book publishers&quot;, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Center for International Studies, and a foreign-aid project in South Vietnam run by Michigan State University.

In 1967, the US magazines &quot;Ramparts&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; reported on the CIA&#x27;s funding of a number of anti-communist cultural organizations aimed at winning the support of supposedly Soviet-sympathizing liberals worldwide. These reports were lent credence by a statement made by a former CIA covert operations director admitting to CIA financing and operation of the CCF. The CIA website states that &quot;the Congress for Cultural Freedom is widely considered one of the CIA&#x27;s more daring and effective Cold War covert operations.&quot;

That same year in May, Thomas Braden, head of the CCF&#x27;s parent body the International Organizations Division, responded to the &quot;Ramparts&quot; report in an article entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Glad the CIA is &#x27;Immoral&#x27;&quot;, in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, defending the activities of his unit within the CIA. For more than ten years, Braden admitted, the CIA had subsidized &quot;Encounter&quot; through the CCF, which it also funded; one of the magazine&#x27;s staff, he added, was a CIA agent.

== Legacy ==
In 1967, the organization was renamed the International Association for Cultural Freedom (IACF) and continued to exist with funding from the Ford Foundation. It inherited &quot;the remaining magazines and national committees, the practice of international seminars, the regional programs, and the ideal of a worldwide community of intellectuals.&quot; There was also, until 1970, &quot;some continuity of personnel&quot;.

Under Shepard Stone and Pierre Emmanuel the dominant policy of the new Association shifted from positions held by its predecessor. No &quot;public anti-Soviet protests&quot; were issued, &quot;not even in support of the harassed Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov&quot;. The culmination of this approach was a vast seminar at Princeton on &quot;The United States: Its Problems, Impact, and Image in the World&quot; (December 1968) where unsuccessful attempts were made to engage with the New Left. From 1968 onwards national committees and magazines (see CCF/IACF Publications below) shut down one after another. In 1977 the Paris office closed and two years later the Association voted to dissolve itself.

Certain of the publications that began as CCF-supported vehicles secured a readership and ongoing relevance that, with other sources of funding, enabled them to long outlast the parent organisation. &quot;Encounter&quot; continued publishing until 1991, as did &quot;Survey&quot;, while the Australian &quot;Quadrant&quot; and the &quot;China Quarterly&quot; survive to this day. While the revelation of CIA funding led to some resignations, notably that of Stephen Spender from &quot;Encounter&quot;, outside Europe the impact was more dramatic: in Uganda, President Milton Obote had Rajat Neogy, the editor of the flourishing &quot;Transition&quot; magazine, arrested and imprisoned. After Neogy left Uganda in 1968 the magazine ceased to exist.

The European Intellectual Mutual Aid Fund (&quot;Fondation pour une Entraide Intellectuelle Européenne&quot;) set up to support intellectuals in Central Europe, began life as an affiliate of the Congress for Cultural Freedom. In 1991 it merged with the Open Society Foundations, set up and supported by financier and philanthropist George Soros. The records of the International Association for Cultural Freedom and its predecessor the Congress for Cultural Freedom are today stored at the Library of the University of Chicago in its Special Collections Research Center.

==Publications==
The Congress founded, sponsored or encouraged a number of publications to disseminate its ideas. Some of them are the following:

Although &quot;The Paris Review&quot; was co-founded by novelist and CIA operative Peter Matthiessen, who was affiliated with the CCF, the magazine was reportedly a cover for Matthiessen, and not part of the CCF&#x27;s operations. However, &quot;The Paris Review&quot; often sold interviews it conducted to CCF-established magazines.

<text>Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum (JFCBS) is a NATO command with its headquarters at Brunssum, the Netherlands. It was established in 2004, as part of a reorganisation that reduced the number of NATO Military Command Structure headquarters. 

== History ==

=== Allied Forces Central Europe from 1953 ===
The command traces its history to Headquarters, Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT), which was activated in August 1953 in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, France.

Ensuring interoperability among land forces of the different NATO Member States has always been a challenge, which is why a variety of NATO standardization activities, such as the NATO Standardization Office, have been underway since the 1950s.

After General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in 1950, he found that devising command arrangements in the Central Region, which contained the bulk of NATO&#x27;s forces, was to be complicated. General Eisenhower considered naming an overall Commander-in-Chief (CINC) for the Central Region but soon realized it would be difficult to find an arrangement that would satisfy all three major powers with forces in the Centre - the United States, United Kingdom and France - because their views on the proper relationship of air and ground power differed significantly. Moreover, he wanted to control the most important region, Central Region, himself.

Drawing upon his Second World War experience, Eisenhower decided to retain overall control himself and did not appoint a CINC for the Central Region. Instead there would be three separate commanders-in-chief (for Allied Air Forces Central Europe, Allied Land Forces Central Europe and Flag Officer Central Europe (FLAGCENT)), all reporting directly to SACEUR. Vice Admiral Robert Jaujard of the French Navy was appointed as Flag Officer Central Europe, and served from 2 April 51 until 20 August 1953. On 20 August 1953 General Ridgeway, Eisenhower&#x27;s successor, established a single Commander-in-Chief (CINCENT) for the region with subordinate land, air and naval commanders (COMLANDCENT, COMAIRCENT, and COMNAVCENT respectively).

One of the command&#x27;s exercises in the 1950s was Operation Counter Punch. Counter Punch was a September 1957 AFCENT air-ground military exercise that also tested NATO&#x27;s integrated air-defense system in its central European front. The exercise involved the national air-defense systems of Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, with Général d&#x27;Armée Jean-Étienne Valluy, French Army, NATO&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Central Europe (CINCENT), in overall command. Operation Counter Punch revealed deficiencies in the Integrated NATO Air Defense System as well as air force responsiveness to theoretical Soviet and Warsaw Pact ground advances.

After July 1962 and the establishment of Commander Allied Forces Baltic Approaches (COMBALTAP), German naval forces were shifted into that command. Thereafter there was no longer any need for the small headquarters of Allied Naval Forces Central Europe and its two subordinate commands, and they were disestablished in 1962, leaving naval liaison provided by a US naval officer.

AFCENT remained in France under French command until 1967, when France removed itself from the military command structure. The headquarters was moved to Brunssum in 1967 and activated under German command.

=== Subordinate AFCENT commands in 1989 ===

During the Cold War, AFCENT commanded the following units:

* Allied Command Europe, in Mons, Belgium
** Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT), in Brunssum, Netherlands
*** Northern Army Group (NORTHAG), at JHQ Rheindahlen, West Germany
**** I Dutch Corps
**** I German Corps
**** I British Corps
**** I Belgian Corps
*** Central Army Group (CENTAG), in Heidelberg, West Germany
**** III German Corps
**** V US Corps
**** VII US Corps
**** II German Corps
*** Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE), in Ramstein Air Base, West Germany
**** Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF)
**** Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4 ATAF)

The III Corps (US) was allocated as NORTHAG reserve. On activation, it would have deployed to Europe from bases in the United States. A forward element, 3rd Brigade, US 2nd Armored Division, was located at Garlstedt, Germany. The U.S. III Corps also maintained a forward headquarters at Tapijn Kazerne, Maastricht, Netherlands.

The commander of US Army Europe, Gen. William W. Crouch, assumed an additional role as commander of NATO LANDCENT on 15 February 1996. He was the first American to command LANDCENT since its 1993 activation. Originally, the LANDCENT command was to be rotated between German and Dutch generals. The dual command of United States Army Europe (USAREUR) and LANDCENT allowed the continued integration of US Army Europe into NATO&#x27;s post-Cold War structure. All NATO corps, except for the :de:IV. Korps (Bundeswehr), were then multinational. In the mid-late 1990s there were four multinational main defence corps in NATO&#x27;s Central Region: one Danish-German (LANDJUT), one Dutch-German (I GE/NL Corps) and two German-United States (II GE/US and V US/GE). In addition, an agreement was made which set out the arrangements under which the European Corps, consisting of units from Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain, would be made available to NATO in times of crisis.
LANDCENT&#x27;s missions were to:
#Protect the peace and deter aggression in NATO&#x27;s central region (Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands). 
#Plan, prepare and direct operations of land forces under NATO command. 
#Plan, coordinate and conduct the land and air subcampaign jointly with NATO&#x27;s Allied Air Command, Central. 
#Develop plans for, and participate in, the MCP and Partnership for Peace (PfP) initiative. 
#Support the flanks of the area of responsibilities. 
The departure from the Cold War era brought the implementation of a new NATO Integrated Military Structure and LandCENT was formally designated Joint Headquarters Centre (JHQ CENT) in a ceremony held on March 9, 2000.

=== Establishment of JFC Brunssum ===
In 2000, the deactivation of Headquarters, Allied Forces Northern Europe (AFNORTH) in Kolsås, Norway led to the redesignation of AFCENT as Regional Headquarters, Allied Forces Northern Europe (RHQ AFNORTH). The headquarters operated as RHQ AFNORTH until 2004, when it was renamed Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum (JFC-B) to add flexibility to the military command structure by removing regional restrictions.

Circa 2010, JFC Brussum appears to be responsible for Contingency Plan Eagle Guardian, NATO&#x27;s Article 5 plan to defend Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

Until March 2013 Command Component Land Heidelberg (FC Heidelberg (Land)), the land component command, was under the control of this headquarter and located at Heidelberg in Germany.

==Facilities==
=== Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk Camp ===
Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk Camp is the headquarters and main base area of JFC Brunssum. Other organizations located on Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk Camp are the NATO Communication and Information Systems Services Agency, Sector Brunssum (NCSA-B) and the NATO Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Programme Management Agency (NAPMA).

Hendrik van Nassau-Ouwerkerk Camp also boasts an all ranks club called Club 13, a small tax-free department store called the B&amp;S Store, a film theatre, a swimming pool, tennis courts and a gymnasium. Additional services are provided by the AAFES on US Army Garrison Brunssum.

===Static War Headquarters Castlegate===

Static War Headquarters Castlegate is a NATO command and communications bunker located approximately 2 km north-east of the town of Linnich, Germany. SWHQ Castlegate is operated in caretaker status by a German military contingent.

==Commanders==
The commander of JFC-B is known as Commander, Joint Force Command Brunssum. The position was formerly known as Commander-in-Chief North (CINCNORTH) and Commander-in-Chief Central (CINCCENT). JFC-B is normally commanded by a German General.

<text>Marcin Kazanowski, (1563/66 – 19 October 1636) was a Polish noble, magnate, castellan of Halice from 1622, voivode of Podole Voivodeship from 1632 and Field Crown Hetman of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1633.

Married to Katarzyna Starzycka in 1600, he was the father of Dominik Aleksander Kazanowski (1605–1648), voivode of Bracław. His family, the Kazanowski family, descendants of Mediolan Comeses, founded the town of Kazanów in 1566.

Under Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, he was one of the commanding officers in the Battle of Górzno in 1629 against the Swedes.

The discovery legend of the Madonna Bołszowiecka relates that during one of the battles against Tatars, Hetman Kazanowski discovered the icon of the Blessed Virgin. This was viewed by his troops as a miracle and boosted their morale, leading to a victory.

Under King Władysław IV Vasa, he also participated in the wars against the Russian Tsardom.

<doc id="1187206" wikidata="Q746960" url="?curid=1187206" title="Otto Kerner Jr.">
<text>Otto Kerner Jr. (August 15, 1908 – May 9, 1976) was an American jurist and politician. He served as the 33rd governor of Illinois from 1961 to 1968 and chaired the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission). He was then appointed a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. He was forced to step down from the bench after being convicted of mail fraud in 1974.

== Early life==
Kerner was born in Chicago, Illinois, on August 15, 1908, the son of Rosalie [née Chmelíková] (1885–1979) and Otto Kerner Sr. (1884–1952). His father, born in Chicago to Czech immigrants from Ronov nad Doubravou and Hrazánky, served as Illinois Attorney General and a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. His mother was born in Lišov and came to America with her parents and sisters. Born into the Czech community of Chicago, he was named after his father.

After graduating with an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Brown University in 1930, Kerner attended Trinity College, Cambridge in England from 1930 to 1931. In 1934, he received a Bachelor of Laws from Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago and was admitted to the Illinois bar. On October 20, 1934, he married Helena Cermak, daughter of the late Anton Cermak, who had been mayor of Chicago before he was shot and mortally wounded in Miami, Florida, in 1933 by Giuseppe Zangara in what may have been an attempt on the life of president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Kerner joined the 33rd Division of the Illinois National Guard in 1934 and because of his time in the National Guard he was quickly granted a commission when the Second World War broke out. In 1942, he entered active duty in World War II, serving as a field artillery officer in the 9th Infantry Division of the United States Army in North Africa and Italy and in the 32nd Infantry Division in the Pacific. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for merit and the Soldier&#x27;s Medal for rescuing a drowning soldier off the coast of Sicily. He was released from active duty in 1946 as a lieutenant colonel and rejoined the Illinois National Guard. In the 33rd Division, Kerner was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Illinois Army National Guard that same year and to brigadier general in 1951. He retired from the Army National Guard in 1954 as a major general. During his time in the Army, Kerner deeply impressed his commanding officer at the time, Jacob Arvey, who was also the leader of the Cook County Democratic party. This friendship proved beneficial to Kerner as it garnered him much support from local politicians, notably Richard J. Daley, who supported Kerner as a Democratic nominee.

== Political career ==
In 1947, Kerner was appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, a post which he held until 1954. He then became a judge in the Illinois Circuit Court of Cook County from 1954 to 1961. In both of those posts, Kerner was an advocate for reforming adoption laws and procedures. He also prosecuted famed automobile executive Preston Tucker for fraud, but Tucker was acquitted.

He defeated incumbent William G. Stratton by more than 500,000 votes in the 1960 Illinois gubernatorial election and was re-elected in 1964, defeating moderate Republican Charles H. Percy. As governor, Kerner promoted economic development, education, mental health services, and equal access to jobs and housing. Some of his major economic developments were when he won the contract to build the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. In 1965 Kerner submitted an article called &quot;Illinois Opens the Export Doors&quot; in which he explained his goal to initiate the full employment granted by export trade citing a potential 250.000 workers that could be put to work. The primary goal was job creation, which to him was achieved through the improvement of trade. As a result, Kerner funded an Illinois Committee for Trade Expansion. His first mission to Europe in 1963 saw an additional $5 million generated for Illinoisan agriculturists. At that time Japan was the state&#x27;s largest trading partner, with $145 million of annual trade. Kerner saw Japan as a valuable asset and thus funded the Illinois Far Eastern Movement which included many corporate delegates. Relations with Japan remained good; the Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, who had been previously invited by Kerner in 1965, gave an impressive speech in 1967 praising the State of Illinois for its continued trade with Japan.

Kerner also proved competent in terms of welfare arrangements. Later on, his advances in mental health programs were so successful that they became a model for the coming national health reform. He served on the National Governors&#x27; Conference Executive Committee from 1967 to 1968, and chaired the Midwestern Governors&#x27; Conference that same year. In July 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson formed the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders and named Kerner its chairman. As chairman of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, Kerner sent a number of letters to Lyndon Johnson urging him to increase the number of black officers in the United States Army, which was drastically low (Army 1.15%, Air Force 0.6%). He also sent a number of letters to Attorney General Ramsey Clark and Rosel H Hyde, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, pressing them for more effective radio equipment for the police force as well as improved riot training. The letters stressed the need to not overlook the major points of the commission&#x27;s findings but to use the lessons learned in the riots to further promote law and order across the nation. Kerner did not run for a third term and resigned as governor on May 20, 1968, to accept a federal judicial appointment.

==Federal judicial service==
Kerner was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on March 11, 1968, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated by Judge Winfred George Knoch. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 11, 1968, and received his commission on April 22, 1968. His service terminated on July 22, 1974, due to his resignation.

== Scandal and conviction ==
In 1969, Marje Lindheimer Everett, manager of Arlington Park and Washington Park race tracks, engaged by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator, was accused of bribing then-Governor Kerner and his Finance Director, Ted Isaacs, to gain choice racing dates for her Arlington Park racetrack. The alleged bribes were in the form of stock options in 1961 that Kerner bought at a reduced price and then sold in 1968 at a profit. The events came to light because Everett had deducted the value of the stock on her federal income tax returns in the belief that the stock option was an ordinary business expense in Illinois. Everett denied at trial that she intended to bribe Kerner, and the government never identified her as a briber.

Even though Kerner reported the profits in his tax returns he was charged with bribery and retained Paul Connolly and Thomas Patton of Williams &amp; Connolly to represent him. Following a 1973 trial in which his prosecutors were future Illinois Republican governor James R. Thompson and future White House Chief of Staff, Republican Samuel K. Skinner. Kerner was convicted on 17 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy, perjury, and related charges. On appeal 13 counts were overturned. Four counts of mail fraud were upheld. He was sentenced to three years in federal prison in Chicago and fined $50,000. Faced with almost certain impeachment, he resigned his position on the federal bench on July 22, 1974.

Kerner began his sentence at a minimum security Federal prison hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. He was released early from prison when it was determined that he was suffering from terminal cancer.

==Death==
Kerner died in Chicago on May 9, 1976. Due to his military service, he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia.

== Awards ==
Otto Kerner was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1977 in the area of Government.

<doc id="1187209" wikidata="Q7419482" url="?curid=1187209" title="Santa Fe–Southern Pacific merger">
<text>The Santa Fe–Southern Pacific merger was an attempted corporate consolidation of two of the major railroads in the Western United States at the time: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Southern Pacific Railroad. The approximately deal (US$ in dollars) was announced in September 1983 and in December 1983, both companies were acquired by a new holding company, the Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation and both companies&#x27; extensive non-railroad related assets were immediately combined. However, the Southern Pacific Railroad remained in a voting trust and the railroads continued to be operated independently and competitively while the merger worked through the regulatory process.

In March 1984, the companies asked the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for approval to merge their railroads. Confident the deal would be approved, the company began repainting their locomotives into a new unified paint scheme that would allow the future railroad to be called SPSF.

In a surprise July 1986 decision, the ICC denied the merger and gave the companies two years to split. Southern Pacific was sold to Rio Grande Industries for in October 1988, the companies&#x27; California real estate holdings were spun off into a new company called Catellus Development Corporation which would become the State&#x27;s largest private landowner, and the former holding company would rename itself Santa Fe Pacific Corporation and retain the Santa Fe Railroad and all the non-railroad businesses of both predecessors.

==History==
Amid an era of major railroad mergers and acquisitions, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company announced on September 27, 1983, that they too would merge. Both were major railroads in the Western United States at the time. The merger had long been seen as a logical move, especially since other recent mergers had turned the Burlington Northern Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad into much larger western railroads, with about the same annual rail revenue of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific combined, and the nation&#x27;s third-largest railroad.

In December 1983, both companies were acquired by a new holding company, the Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation, through a swap of approximately in stock. On March 23, 1984, Santa Fe Southern Pacific formally petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to approve the merger of the two railroads and while the application was pending, the Southern Pacific remained in a voting trust, and the railroads continued to be operated independently and competitively while the merger worked through the regulatory process. So confident the deal would be approved, the company began repainting their locomotives into a new unified paint scheme that would allow the future railroad to be called the SPSF Railway.

Immediately combined were the company&#x27;s extensive non-railroad holdings. Santa Fe had holdings in gold mines in California and Nevada, and owned part of oil and gas complex in California valued at close to $2 billion. Southern Pacific owned more California real estate than any other corporation, with huge amounts of forest land and prime urban property including 200 acres in Downtown San Francisco and more than 150 acres near Disneyland, estimated to be worth as much as $5 billion.

The Justice Department and competing railroads strongly criticized the merger, but industry analysts largely expected the deal to be approved. In an argument for the merger, John J. Schmidt, the head of Santa Fe Southern Pacific, said in testimony in front of the ICC board that since 1982 Southern Pacific had either lost money or made very little profit each year, and suggested that Santa Fe was not financially healthy enough to survive independently. After the testimony, ICC staff recommended to the board that the merger be approved, with some conditions that he said the staff believed would solve the competition problem.

The company was stunned on July 24, 1986, when the ICC board rejected the proposed merger, saying that the anti-competitive problems outweighed the public benefits of joining the rail systems. Specifically, in the 4-1 decision, the ICC cited that the railroads had extensive parallel operations in California and across the Southwest, and that merging the lines would have a “substantial adverse effect” on competition.

The company quickly moved to strike a deal with competitor Union Pacific to grant them rights to use some of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific tracks. The company also started the process of selling off some of its non-railroad businesses. After those changes, on December 9, 1986, the company appealed the ICC decision. On April 20, 1987, Santa Fe Southern Pacific Chairman and CEO John J. Schmidt resigned under pressure, reportedly ousted by the company&#x27;s board of directors who were displeased with the way the merger was handled.

Ultimately, despite the changes, on June 30, 1987, the ICC declined to reconsider the merger and orders the company to sell one or both of the rail lines within two years.

Southern Pacific was sold to Rio Grande Industries for in October 1988, the companies California real estate holdings were spun off into a new company called Catellus Development Corporation which would become the State&#x27;s largest private landowner, and the former holding company would rename itself Santa Fe Pacific Corporation and retain the Santa Fe Railroad and the remaining the non-railroad businesses of both predecessors.

In 1995, the Santa Fe railroad merged with Burlington Northern to form BNSF Railway, and the Southern Pacific was acquired by the Union Pacific Corporation the following year.

==&quot;Kodachrome&quot; paint scheme==
The Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation was so confident the merger would be approved, the company began repainting their locomotives into a new unified paint scheme that would allow the future railroad to be called the SPSF Railway. Because the railroads were legally required to operate separately, the paint scheme included the letters SP or SF and an adjacent empty space where the other two letters could be added after the merger was approved.

The locomotive livery was based on the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Yellowbonnet&quot; with a red stripe on the locomotive&#x27;s nose; the remainder of the locomotive body was painted in Southern Pacific&#x27;s scarlet red (from their &quot;Bloody Nose&quot; scheme) with a black roof and black extending down to the lower part of the locomotive&#x27;s radiator grills. The number boards were red with white numbers. In large block letters within the red portion of the sides was either &quot;SP&quot; (for Southern Pacific-owned locomotives) or &quot;SF&quot; (for Santa Fe-owned locomotives).
This paint scheme, combining yellow, red and black, has come to be called the &quot;Kodachrome&quot; paint scheme due to the colors&#x27; resemblance to those on the boxes that Kodak used to package its Kodachrome slide film (which was heavily used by railfans of the time). After the ICC&#x27;s denial, railroad industry writers, employees of both railroads and railfans alike joked that SPSF really stood for &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Paint So Fast&quot;.

The lettering was positioned on the locomotive sides so that the other half of the lettering could be added after the merger became official. Two ATSF EMD SD45-2s (ATSF #7219 and #7221) were painted with the full SPSF lettering to show what the unified paint scheme would look like after the merger was complete. One Santa Fe caboose was also painted with &quot;SPSF&quot; in a similar situation.

At the time of merger denial, approximately 306 ATSF locomotives, four ATSF cabooses, 10 ATSF slugs, 96 SP locomotives, and one SP caboose had been painted in this fashion. The two railroads made an effort to repaint locomotives in their standard paint schemes after the merger was denied. Santa Fe repainted all Kodachromes still on roster by 1990, while Southern Pacific&#x27;s less numerous Kodachromes were repainted much more slowly; some remained active on the Union Pacific after the SP buyout.

One EMD GP9 locomotive in the &quot;Kodachrome&quot; livery (ex-SP 2873) was preserved by the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, California.

<doc id="1187216" wikidata="Q319645" url="?curid=1187216" title="Christian Michelsen">
<text>Peter Christian Hersleb Kjerschow Michelsen (15 March 1857– 29 June 1925), better known as Christian Michelsen, was a Norwegian shipping magnate and statesman. He was the first prime minister of independent Norway from 1905 to 1907. Michelsen is most known for his central role in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, and was one of Norway&#x27;s most influential politicians of his time.

==Background==
Born in Bergen, he was named after his grandfather, bishop Peder Christian Hersleb Kjerschow. He was the eldest of five siblings born into a merchant family. Michelsen attended the Bergen Cathedral School. He studied law at The Royal Frederick University and went on to become a lawyer. He later established the shipping company, Chr. Michelsen &amp; Co., which became one of the largest in Norway.

==Political career==
He became a member of the Norwegian Parliament (&quot;Storting&quot;) in 1891, representing the Liberal Party of Norway. He considered himself mostly above petty party strifes, and one of his major aims was to create a coalition of parties reaching from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Party, which he called the Coalition Party. He served as Finance Minister in the second cabinet Hagerup, and was one of the strongest proponents of a more firm policy towards the union between Sweden and Norway. In March 1905, Michelsen replaced Francis Hagerup as Prime Minister, and immediately became the leader of the movement towards dissolution of the union (&quot;Unionsoppløsningen i 1905&quot;).

The formal basis for the dissolution was King Oscar II&#x27;s refusal to accept the Norwegian consular laws (&quot;Konsulatsaken&quot;). The Swedish government had for several years insisted that laws governing foreign affairs had to be a part of the union agreement, and as such, consular laws could not be passed by the Norwegian Storting without consent of the Swedish Parliament (&quot;Riksdag&quot;). The Swedes were willing to accept the Norwegian urge for separate consular affairs, but they demanded that Norway accept the precedent under which the union had operated for 90 years, namely that the Foreign Minister be Swedish. This, the Norwegians felt, acknowledged Sweden as having the upper hand in the Union. While this supremacy existed in reality, Norwegians were unwilling to accept the unequal relationship on a formal, legal basis.

On 27 May 1905 King Oscar refused to sign the bill, and in response the Norwegian cabinet ministers resigned collectively. The king took no further action, probably aware that a dissolution of the Union was imminent, and the Swedish politicians did nothing, probably believing that this was another Norwegian political retreat. On 7 June, the Norwegian Storting declared that because the King had been unable to form a new government in Norway after Michelsen&#x27;s resignation, he had lost the capacity to rule and hence ceased to be king of Norway. This strategic move gave the dissolution a somewhat legal basis, and was primarily the work of Christian Michelsen. He knew that the Norwegian people, after months of well-directed information in a unanimous press, was united in a way that is extremely rare in a democracy. In the referendum that proved the Norwegian will to dissolve the union, retention of the union garnered a mere 184 votes nationwide, which represented only one vote out of every 2000 cast.

Michelsen, though a believer in a democratic republic in Norway, accepted that a democratic monarchy would have the greatest chances to be accepted abroad and among a majority of Norwegians. Prince Carl of Denmark became King Haakon VII of Norway after a new referendum had given the monarchy proponents approximately 79% of the votes cast.

In 1906 Michelsen won the election on an &quot;above-the-parties&quot; ticket, which quickly alienated the leading Liberals from him. In 1907 he resigned, having tired of petty squabbles among the political leaders, and accepting that his political views had been defeated. Jørgen Løvland carried on Michelsen&#x27;s work, but lacked the will to force the coalition to stand united, and in 1908 the coalition broke down. In social policy, Michelsen&#x27;s time as prime minister saw the passage of the 1906 Law on Central and Local Government Contributions to Unemployment Funds, which introduced voluntary insurance.

In 1925, he, along with the polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen and the industrialist Joakim Lehmkuhl, founded the Fatherland League.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1881 to Johanne Benedicte Wallendahl (1861–1910). In 1905, he was awarded the Grand Cross of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and in 1907 he received the Collar as well.

===Gamlehaugen===

In the year 1899, Michelsen began the construction of the Gamlehaugen mansion, which was completed in 1900. The estate today functions as a residence of the Norwegian royal family and is open to the public.

==Chr. Michelsen Institute==

Michelsen bequeathed most of his estate to a fund which made possible the establishment and operation of . In recent times, the Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) was established as an independent centre for research on international development and policy. Founded in Bergen in 1930, CMI conducts both applied and theoretical research, and has a multidisciplinary profile anchored in four thematic research groups, namely human rights, democracy and development, peace, conflict and the state, poverty reduction and public sector reform.

<doc id="1187218" wikidata="Q619980" url="?curid=1187218" title="Bergen Airport, Flesland">
<text>Bergen Airport (; ), alternatively Bergen Flesland Airport or simply Flesland Airport, is an international airport located at Flesland in the city and municipality of Bergen, Vestland, Norway. Opened in 1955, it is the second-busiest airport in Norway, with 6,306,623 passengers in 2018. Flesland is operated by the state-owned Avinor. Until 1999, Flesland Air Station of the Norwegian Air Force was co-located at the airport.

Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Norwegian Air Shuttle and Widerøe are the largest airlines operating at the airport. The route to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, is among the busiest in Europe. Substantial traffic is generated by CHC Helikopter Service and Bristow Norway to offshore oil platforms in the North Sea.

Originally, Bergen was served by water aerodromes at Flatøy, Sandviken, and Herdla. Financing of Flesland was largely secured through NATO funds, and the airport opened on 2 October 1955. Until the 1980s, Bergen was the Norwegian airport used for intercontinental flights by SAS to New York. New terminals were opened in 1988 and in August 2017. The Bergen Light Rail was extended to the airport in April 2017.

==History==

===Construction===
The first aircraft to operate in Bergen was a demonstration flight by Carl Gustav Cederström on 25 September 1911. The first airport in the Bergen area was Flatøy Air Station, built by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service on the island of Flatøy. The water aerodrome was established in 1919; it remained in use until 1940. Norway&#x27;s first scheduled airline service was started by Det Norske Luftfartsrederi between Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger in 1920, and operated out of Bergen Airport, Sandviken, a water aerodrome just north of the city center. The aerodrome became the Bergen base for both Norwegian Air Lines and Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap.

Planning of an airport with an airstrip took place during the 1930s. A series of public institutions made various reports between 1931 and 1938, which largely recommended Flesland as a location, which was at the time located in the then independent municipality of Fana. The main alternative was Herdla, an island northernmost in Askøy, which was first recommended in 1933. The main disadvantage with Flesland was the topography and that it would not be possible to build longer runways than , respectively. A municipal committee recommended therefore in 1938 that Herdla be chosen, to be jointly financed by the state and the municipality

After the German occupation of Norway, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; started looking for a location for an airstrip. They were partially in need for a counteraction against British raids and in part in need to protect German ship traffic. Four locations were considered: Nesttun, Haukåsmyrene in Åsane, Flesland and Herdla. The choice of Herdla was taken after a German bomber emergency landed in a field and was later able to take off from there. Herdla received two runways, the longest long.

The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) started working on plans for an airport for Bergen in 1947. Herdla was by them seen as the prime candidate, again based on the poor topography around Bergen. The CAA recommended that Herdla be chosen and that the two runways be expanded. However, its director, Einar Bøe, was skeptical to the Herdla plans, citing the lack of possibilities to extend the runway past the initially proposed and the long travel distance from Herdla to the city. At the time there was no bridge either from Herdla to Askøy nor from Askøy to the mainland, nor was there a road across the island. Transport would therefore have to be carried out from Bergen using a ferry. The Minister of Transport and Communications Nils Langhelle from Bergen supported Bøe&#x27;s concerns and recommended that Parliament place construction of an airport serving Bergen on hold.

Engineering reports were made of both Herdla and Flesland in 1950 and 1951. Previous investigations of Flesland had concluded that the length of the runway was limited to a small valley which is located at about the middle of the current runway. The new report proposed connecting the proposed area to a larger area to the south of the valley, which was at the right elevation. This would allow for a long runway. A political concern was the high cost of constructing a new airport. By 1950, land airports had been built for Oslo Airport, Fornebu, Stavanger, Trondheim and Kristiansand. This was supplemented with SAS deciding to terminate the services to Oslo and instead provide a feeder service to Stavanger.

Alternatives were launched by two competing airlines: Braathens SAFE proposed a minor upgrade to Herdla which would allow them to operate with their de Havilland Heron aircraft. Widerøe on their side proposed using their Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, but these proved to expensive. At the same time the Royal Norwegian Air Force stated looking at Flesland as a suitable air station. Military engineers surveyed the area and concluded that it was well-suited for military purposes. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) granted funding for seven air stations in Norway in 1952, but these did not include Flesland.

Financing was instead secured through a national military communications project, of which 16 million Norwegian krone (NOK) was set aside over a period of three years, which would secure construction of a runway. A further NOK 4 million was presumed financed by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana to build a terminal, eminent domain and a road. The plans were passed by Parliament on 25 April 1952. The military funding was arranged by Langhelle, who by then had been appointed Minister of Defence. Flesland received additional NATO grants in 1953, which would finance NOK 50 million and the Ministry of Defence NOK 5 million. The increased funding allowed the runway to be extended to .

Construction started on 14 August 1952 with construction of a road from Blomsterdalen. Construction on the airport itself started in early 1953. Between 200 and 300 people worked on the construction, some of whom lived in sheds at Nordheim. Work was carried out in two shifts. Thirty farms were partially expropriated. Half a million cubic meters (18 million cu ft) of rock were blasted and a similar amount of earthwork moved in the construction process. The work consisted of a runway and an equivalently long taxiway, although it was only half the width. The terminal building cost NOK 200,000 and was located next to a parking lot with space for 70 cars. A long barbed wire fence circumferenced the airport. The airport had an instrument landing system from the start.
Two people were killed in the construction, which had a total cost of NOK 70 million.

===Early operational history===
The first aircraft to land at the airport was a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter of the Air Force on 18 June 1954. At the time, of the runway was completed. The paved section was extended to and several Douglas DC-3 aircraft landed. The first revenue flight was a charter carried out by Braathens SAFE for SK Brann, who flew to Oslo to play a football match. The military officially took the airport into use on 14 September 1954. The official civilian opening took place on 2 October 1955. By then, the airport had a temporary terminal and control tower, the airport road was not paved, aviation fuel tanks were not installed and there was no snow-removal equipment.
From the opening, Flesland was served by three airlines. SAS flew three round trips to Oslo and once per day to Stavanger, Kristiansand and onwards to Aalborg in Denmark, with correspondence onwards to Copenhagen. Twice per week, the Stavanger flight corresponded with services to London and Amsterdam. Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap flew services northwards along the coast to towns in Møre og Romsdal and to Trondheim. Iceland-based Loftleiðir received permission to operate a flight from Flesland via Reykjavík to New York twice per week.
The airport had 70,000 passengers during its first twelve months of operations and exceeded 100,000 the following year. The temporary terminal was too small for this traffic and already during construction there was designed a larger terminal by Halfdan Grieg. By 1956, it was determined that the new terminal building would be too small. Also, an expansion of the runway was discussed that year. SAS announced that they would take delivery of the intercontinental jetliner Douglas DC-8, which would require a longer runway than was available at both Flesland and Fornebu. The cost of extending the runway to would cost NOK 3.5 million in Bergen and NOK 30 million in Oslo.

Helikopter Service established itself at Flesland in 1958, two years after the Stavanger-based company was established. The same year, Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap filed for bankruptcy and Ålesund Airport, Vigra, opened. Thus Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession for the route Stavanger–Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. Both SAS and Braathens were granted concession to operate the route from Kristiansand via Stavanger to Bergen. The same year, a new terminal building opened.

During a short period in 1959, there was a squadron stationed at Flesland. From 1962, there were regular detachments within NATO that were earmarked for Flesland. Every other year, there were larger exercises with about a dozen aircraft and lasting for several weeks. Smaller training sessions were held every six weeks. The air station was upgraded in 1962 and consisted of a series of mountain halls, which could house more than twenty-five fighter aircraft. These also included barracks and commando facilities. Flesland was designated as a deployment site for nuclear warheads by NATO, which had prior to 1962 been designated to Sola Air Station. Components for nuclear bombs were most probably stored at Flesland, although the warheads themselves were probably not stored there.
With the delivery of DC-8-aircraft, SAS started a direct service to New York. The runway at Fornebu was too short to handle the DC-8, so Flesland became the main intercontinental hub in Norway. Another important factor during the 1960s was the low range of the aircraft—thus Bergen was a stop-over for aircraft from Stockholm and Copenhagen. Later, the route was taken over using the Boeing 747. SAS started a direct service from Bergen to Tromsø in 1965. Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, opened in 1970, with Braathens SAFE receiving the route concession from Bergen. Two years later, in a national realignment of concessions, SAS lost their right to fly to Tromsø. Instead Braathens SAFE was granted the right to fly from Bergen via Ålesund, Kristiansund, and the newly opened Molde Airport, Årø, to Bodø and Tromsø.

The first four regional airports in Sogn og Fjordane and Møre og Romsdal were opened in 1971, and Widerøe started flights to Florø, Førde, Sogndal and Ørsta–Volda. They were operated with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft, and passengers had to transfer at Flesland to reach Oslo. A SAS service to New York from Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, was introduced in 1974, and gradually the service was reduced, in part because of the increased range of newer aircraft. Haugesund Airport, Karmøy, opened in 1975, and SAS opened a service between the two cities.

Because of the increase of traffic was making the terminal building more cramped, a new administration building opened in the early 1970s, with a fire station in the ground floor. At the peak in 1976 and 1977, the air station had 60 employees and 15 conscripts. Helikopter Service started services to offshore oil platforms in May 1976; the first services were to Statfjord and were flown using Sikorsky S-61 helicopters. Busy Bee started a competing service from Bergen via Haugesund to Stavanger in 1982. Two years, late Norsk Air started a service from Sandefjord. Braathens SAFE was allowed to operate the Oslo to Bergen route from 1987. Automatic check-in machines were introduced the following year.

===Demilitarization and deregulation===
The current terminal opened in 1988, was also designed by Halfdan Grieg and cost NOK 250 million. This was followed up with a new control tower which opened in 1991. It had a limited height because of restrictions caused by the military designation of the main parallel taxiway as an emergency runway. By the mid-1980s there were 35 to 40 daily offshore helicopter flights out of Flesland each day. This was causing a press on the runway&#x27;s capacity as the helicopters had to cross the runway to reach the North Sea. As estimates showed up to 60 flights per day, the airport started working on plans for a separate helicopter terminal, which would have been located southwest of the old main terminal and would have its own helicopter runway. Instead the traffic flatted out and the old main terminal was converted to a helicopter terminal. Braathens Helikopter established a base with two helicopters at Flesland in 1990. Within two years it had secured a thirty-percent market share of the offshore traffic. However, the airline was taken over by Helikopter Service in 1993.

With the ending of the Cold War following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the military activity at Flesland diminished. Planning of the downgrading of the air station had started in 1988, and from 1995 only personnel necessary for maintaining infrastructure was left, reducing the crew to 33. Braathens SAFE introduced its first international Bergen service in 1991, to Newcastle. Norwegian Air Shuttle, originally a regional airline, took over Braathens&#x27; and Busy Bee&#x27;s regional services from Bergen following the latter&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1992. Norwegian originally flew to Kristiansand, Haugesund, Molde and Kristiansund. The domestic airline market was deregulated on 1 April 1994, so airlines no longer needed a concession to operate domestic routes. The immediate consequence was an increase of the number of flights by Braathens SAFE to Oslo.

Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998, replacing the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Bergen using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The following price war on the route saw lower ticket prices and increased capacity. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion. The final demise of the air station came in 1999, when all stationary assets were sold, including 30 vehicles. The daily operation of the air station was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy, who have six employees at the base. Flesland Air Station has since only held mobilization status and will only be used by the air force in case of war and larger emergencies. Bergen Air Transport started flights to Notodden in 1999. A new secondary surveillance radar was built between 1999 and 2001 at Sotra. The domestic terminal was expanded with and a new baggage sorting area with in 2001.

SAS bought Braathens in 2001, and from the following year, only SAS flew the Oslo route. Within months, Norwegian started a low-cost route to Gardermoen. SAS Commuter took over Norwegian&#x27;s regional routes in 2003. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute closed its office at the airport in 2003 and all meteorological observations have since been carried out by Avinor. In 2004, SAS and Braathens merged to form SAS Braathens. The airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. The international arrival section was expanded with in 2005, followed by an extra story over part of the terminal, used as offices and allowed a doubling of the size of the duty-free.

&quot;Wanderlust&quot; announced Flesland as Europe&#x27;s best and the world&#x27;s sixth-best international airport in 2009. The helicopter terminal was renovated in 2009. An airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010 and a new backup radar was installed in 2011. An additional of office space was added in 2010. Widerøe took over SAS&#x27; regional routes to Bergen in 2010. From May to September 2022, United Airlines offered service to Newark.

==Facilities==

The main terminal covers an area of , of which is used for passenger areas. The terminal has reached its capacity for simultaneous passengers, and especially security, check-in, arrival hall and baggage handling have limited space.

All passengers traveling on international flight must pass through the duty-free shop in order to get to their flight. There is a possibility for some passengers (for example, those allergic to perfume) to ask security to use a narrow corridor which bypasses the shop. Nonetheless, the layout has been criticized by teetotalist organizations. The airport&#x27;s response is that the layout was needed due to the terminal&#x27;s small size. The shop has also been criticized for informing passengers who purchase less than their permitted tax-free quota of alcohol that they are allowed to purchase more. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs indicated that this may violate the ban on alcohol advertising.

The gates at the new terminal are numbered B15 to B20. They are served by domestic flights. International flights depart from the older 1988 terminal which has 9 jet bridges, numbered 23 through 29, 31 and 32. Gate 30, next to gate 29, is used for apron buses. Gate 24 has the largest parking space and can take category E aircraft (such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747), the rest are category C (such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320). Gates 28 to 32 can be configured to serve domestic flights as well as international flights.
The helicopter terminal is located in the old terminal from the airport&#x27;s opening and covers an area of . There are nine helicopter stands, of which six are outside the terminal building. The control tower is next to the helicopter terminal and has an area of . It lacks visual sight lines to stands south of the terminal, the de-icing and parts of the taxiway. Nearby is the fire station; the building is also used for offices. There are a series of other hangars and buildings at the airport, owned by various airlines, ground handling companies, aviation clubs and general aviation companies.

The airport has a single runway numbered 17–35 (roughly north–south). The runway has shoulders on each side and has between the touchdown points. The runway has a parallel taxiway (Y), with nine intersections. There is also a taxiway further in along between the terminal and technical area (W). There are six intersections between W and Y, one of which leads to the military area. There is instrument landing system (ILS) category I on both directions. The airport has an airport surveillance radar; there are both a surveillance radar and a backup radar located on Sotra. The runway has a capacity of maximum twenty landings and twenty departures per hour.

The runway, main taxiway and all areas to the north of the civil aviation area are owned by the military. Flesland Air Station no longer has stationed aircraft, but there is activity in several of the military installations. Flesland is occasionally used during exercises. The military has indicated that it may choose to sell its estate at the airport in the future. Avinor and the military have initiated a process that may result in the runway and taxiway being transferred to Avinor ownership.

==Airlines and destinations==
As of June 2023, Bergen Airport serves 63 destinations in regular services and 28 seasonal or charter destinations primarily during the summer. In addition, offshore oil platforms are served from the helicopter terminal. Twenty-three airlines operate regular flights out of Flesland. They are served by two ground handling agents, SAS Ground Services and Norport Handling.

The largest airlines at Flesland are Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Widerøe. SAS and Norwegian exclusively operate jetliners on main-haul international and domestic routes. Widerøe operates the routes to Florø, Sogndal and Ørsta–Volda on public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airline&#x27;s remaining routes are commercial. The airline uses various sizes of the Bombardier Dash 8. Bergen Air Transport is based at Flesland, and offers general aviation and executive jet operations. Bristow Norway and CHC Helikopter Service operate to offshore oil platforms from the helicopter terminal. Lufttransport transport maritime pilots to ships on behalf of the Norwegian Coastal Administration.


==Traffic==

In 2014, Bergen Airport had 6,078,589 passengers, 106,225 aircraft movements and 5,199 tonnes of cargo, making it the country&#x27;s second-busiest airport. The passenger numbers consisted of 3,669,600 domestic scheduled, 2,162,781 international scheduled, 138,252 transit passengers, 246,208 helicopter passengers. Bergen has ten percent of the Norway&#x27;s international traffic.

Sixty-four percent of the airport&#x27;s domestic traffic was business, compared to thirty-five percent for international flights. Seventy-one percent of the international traffic was generated by people living in Norway. For domestic flights, SAS has a market share of 46 percent, Norwegian 38 percent, Widerøe 15 percent and others 1 percent. For international flights, Norwegian has a market share of 36 percent, SAS 23 percent, KLM 18 percent, Lufthansa 9 percent and others 15 percent. In comparison, in 2003 SAS had a market share of 71 percent for international routes and 78 percent for domestic routes.

In 2011, the route Oslo–Bergen had 1,680,000 passengers, making it the second busiest route in Norway (after Oslo–Trondheim). It was in 2007 the seventh-busiest route in Europe. The routes from Bergen to Stavanger and Trondheim are the busiest routes in Norway which do not operate through Oslo. Norwegian and SAS nearly split the Oslo market evenly, although SAS has 54 percent of the business market and Norwegian 58 percent of the leisure market. Since 2003, the percentage of passengers traveling from Bergen who are dependent on transferring abroad before reaching their ultimate destination has fallen from about 60 percent to below 40 percent.

==Ground transport==

Flesland is located along National Road 580, about from the city center and about 30 minutes drive. Avinor has 3,500 parking spaces at the airport, of which 1,500 are in a parking garage. An additional 700 parking spaces are provided by the private Flesland Parkering; although located further away, it provides a shuttle bus service to the terminal. The airport has five car rental companies with a combined fleet of 100 vehicles.

The Bergen Light Rail has its final stop at the airport and opened in April 2017.

Tide&#x27;s coaches have a travel time of about 20 minutes, and operate every 10 minutes. They alternate operating via Fjøsanger and Fyllingsdalen, At Flesland Quay, connected to the airport by shuttle bus, there are several fast ferry services to Austevoll, Sunnhordland, Haugesund and Stavanger. Four taxi companies operate at the airport. The modal distribution of ground transport is 21 percent use bus, 31 percent use taxis, 27 percent are driven by others and 20 percent use their own car. This is less than half the public transport share of Trondheim and almost a third of Gardermoen, but much higher than Stavanger.

==Accidents and incidents==
Helikopter Service Flight 165, a crash of a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter into the North Sea northwest of the airport, took place on 26 June 1978. The aircraft was en route from Flesland to Statfjord A, an offshore oil platform. The accident was caused by a fatigue crack in the knuckle joint, causing one of the rotor blades to loosen. All eighteen people on board were killed in the crash.

A helicopter crashed on Turøy near Bergen on 29 April 2016, when flying from the Gullfaks B oil platform to the Bergen Airport. It was a Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma. All thirteen people on board (2 crew, 11 passenger) were killed in the crash.

==Future==
Avinor is currently in the final stages of building a new terminal building immediately southeast of the current terminal. Based on a design by Narud Stokke Wiig Arkitekter og Planleggere (now Nordic — Office of Architecture), it is scheduled for completion in 2016 and is estimated to have sufficient capacity until 2026. The new terminal will have an area of and have a capacity for 10 million annual passengers. In addition to larger terminal capacity, it will give the airport six new gates. The price is estimated at NOK 2 Billion and will also include an expansion of the Bergen Light Rail to the airport.

The runway is considered upgraded to ILS Cat II or III, which will allow for landing during less visibility. There are only a few minor investments needed for the upgrade. Avinor estimates that there will be a need for a second runway at about the mid-2030s. The runway can be located on the current military area and be entirely located north of the terminal area. This would allow a runway, which would be sufficient for Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft. The master plan of 2011 includes plans for expanding the new terminal by placing gates on both sides of the pier and building a new pier to the north, by demolishing the current terminal. By Phase 3C, which is estimated to be carried out by 2060, the airport will have 32 gates and 14 additional apron stands. The last phases of the long-term plan involve demolishing the current terminal and the airport hotel. The Norwegian State Railways has looked at the possibility of building a mainland railway airport rail link from Bergen Station in the city center. The proposal was launched as a response to the idea that a new freight terminal be built at Flesland. If built, the line would run in a tunnel through Løvstakken and travel time would be twenty minutes.

<text>Flesland is a village in the borough of Ytrebygda in the municipality of Bergen in Vestland county, Norway. It sits on the western coast of the Bergen Peninsula, about southwest of the city centre of Bergen. It is the site of Bergen Airport, Flesland and Flesland Air Station.

The village has a population (2019) of 352 and a population density of .

==Name==
The village is named after the old &quot;Flesland&quot; farm, and the Old Norse form of the name was probably &quot;Flesjaland&quot;. The first element is the genitive plural of &quot;fles&quot; which means &quot;skerry&quot; or &quot;sunken rock&quot; and the last element is &quot;land&quot; which means &quot;land&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;.

<doc id="1187224" wikidata="Q10777021" url="?curid=1187224" title="Owlbear">
<text>An owlbear (also owl bear) is a fictional creature originally created for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. An owlbear is depicted as a cross between a bear and an owl, which &quot;hugs&quot; like a bear and attacks with its beak. Inspired by a plastic toy made in Hong Kong, Gary Gygax created the owlbear and introduced the creature to the game in the 1975 &quot;Greyhawk&quot; supplement; the creature has since appeared in every subsequent edition of the game. Owlbears, or similar beasts, also appear in several other fantasy role-playing games, video games and other media.

==Creation==
In the early 1970s, Gary Gygax was playing &quot;Chainmail&quot;, a wargame that also served as a precursor of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. In order to give his players as many different challenges as possible, Gygax was always on the look-out for new monsters. Although he was able to draw on pulp fiction and sword and sorcery stories for many of them, he also looked through dime stores for figurines that could be used in battle. On one of those occasions, he came across a bag of small plastic toys erroneously labeled &quot;prehistoric animals&quot;. Made in Hong Kong, the set included monsters from Japanese &quot;Kaiju&quot; films such as Ultraman and the Godzilla franchise. Several of these were odd enough to catch his eye, and he used them to represent several new monsters, including the owlbear, the bulette and the rust monster.

==Concept==
The owlbear is depicted as an eight to ten foot (2.5–3 meter) tall cross between a bear and an owl. According to descriptions in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; source books, owlbears are carnivorous creatures, famed for their aggression and ferocity; they live in mated pairs in caves and hunt any creature bigger than a mouse. They use a &quot;hug&quot; and their beak to attack. In the game&#x27;s third edition, it was categorized as a &quot;magical beast&quot;.

The actual in-game origin of the owlbear has never been definitively revealed, but the various &quot;Monster Manual&quot; editions indicate that it is probably the product of a wizard&#x27;s experiments. Within the franchise&#x27;s mythology, the lich Thessalar claims to have created them, but his insanity and egomania put the accuracy of this claim in doubt. In the 5th edition, some elves claim that owlbears have existed for millennia and older fey say that they have always existed in the Feywild.

Within the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; system and in other role-playing games, the owlbear usually serves as a monster.

==Publication history==
The owlbear is among the earliest monsters in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and, like the bulette and the rust monster, was inspired by a Hong Kong–made plastic toy purchased by Gary Gygax for use as a miniature in a &quot;Chainmail&quot; game.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
The owl bear was introduced to the game in its first supplement, &quot;Greyhawk&quot; (1975). It is described as a &quot;horrid creature&quot; which &quot;hugs&quot; like a bear, and deals damage with its beak. The owlbear is also listed on random encounter tables in &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot;, the third supplement. The illustration shows a bear-like creature on all fours, and bears no resemblance to the plastic toy that had given Gygax his original inspiration.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition===
The owlbear appears in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977), where it is described as a &quot;horrible creature that inhabits tangled forest regions, and attacks with its great claws and snapping beak&quot;. The illustration of the owlbear shown in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was done by Dave Sutherland, and closely correlates to Gygax&#x27;s original plastic toy.

===Basic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
This edition of the&quot; D&amp;D&quot; game included its own owl bear, in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; (1981 and 1983). The owl bear was also later featured in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game&quot; set (1991), the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia&quot; (1991), the &quot;Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game&quot; set (1994), and the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Game&quot; set (1999).

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition===
The owlbear appears first in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume One&quot; (1989), and is reprinted in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993).

The owlbear appeared in the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; setting in the adventure &quot;Black Spine&quot; (1994).

The owlbear was detailed in &quot;Dragon&quot; #214 (February 1995), in &quot;The Ecology of the Owlbear&quot;, which also included the arctic owlbear and the winged owlbear. These variants were later reprinted in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Three&quot; (1996).

The greater owlbear appeared in an adventure in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #63 (July 1997).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition===
The owlbear appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2000).

The owlbear appeared on the Wizards of the Coast website for the &quot;Chainmail&quot; game, in 2000.

The winged owlbear in adult and juvenile form appeared in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #84 (January 2001).

The supplemental book &quot;Unapproachable East&quot; features a feat, an ability that player characters can obtain, named &quot;owlbear berserker&quot; that allows a player character to use a ferocious owlbear-like fighting style.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 ===
The owlbear appears in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2003) as well as the owlbear skeleton under the skeleton entry.

The ancient owlbear appeared in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #107 (February 2004).

The Ankholian owlbear appeared in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Bestiary of Krynn&quot; (2004) and the &quot;Revised Bestiary of Krynn&quot; (2007).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition===
The owlbear appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2008) along with the winterclaw owlbear. The flavor text mentions that owlbears can be tamed to serve as guards.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials&quot;===
The &quot;Monster Vault&quot; boxed set contains the owlbear as well as various subtypes like the young owlbear, trained owlbear, wind-claw owlbear and again the winterclaw owlbear. The cover of the monster book included in the box and the box itself feature an owlbear alongside other monsters.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition===
In May 2012, Wizards of the Coast employee Jon Schindehette announced that the inclusion and design of the owlbear for the upcoming fifth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was being discussed.

The monster was included in the &quot;bestiary&quot; of the &quot;D&amp;D Next Playtest Package&quot;, a compilation of files available for gamers interested in playtesting this &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; version before its official release.

The owlbear is included in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; of the full release of the game, published in 2014. The flavor text states that remote settlements have used owlbears for racing, and it also states the fact that owlbears are more likely to attack their tamer, than actually begin the race.

==In other role-playing games==
===&quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;===
The owlbear is an official monster in the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot; that is based on &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition. It is included in the game&#x27;s first bestiary, and elaborated on in &quot;Dungeon Denizens Revisited&quot;. &quot;Dungeon Denizens Revisited&quot; also includes a variant named siege owlbear. Furthermore, Paizo released a part of the series &quot;Behind the Monsters&quot; dedicated to the owlbear, which features the bearowl, the possibly &quot;even stranger offspring&quot; of an owlbear. Additional official &quot;Pathfinder&quot; variants of the owlbear are the arctic owlbear, Darklands owlbear, fruss owlbear, great hook-clawed owlbear, screaming owlbear, sleeyk owlbear, slime owlbear, sloth owlbear as well as the spectral owlbear.

The adventure module &quot;Pathfinder #7 – Curse of the Crimson Throne Chapter 1: &quot;Edge of Anarchy&quot;&quot; originally published by Paizo Publishing for &quot;Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition&quot; under the OGL contains a taxidermic owlbear. It is a regular owlbear with the skeleton template allowing the game master to turn a regular monster into an undead one. A skeletal owlbear illustration was also done by Goodman Games artist Nick Greenwood.

===Retro-clones and OSR RPGs===
As only the design of a role-playing game, not the rules are protected by U.S. copyright law, it is possible for third-party publishers to release RPG systems based on the rules of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; without using the actual name or trademarks associated with the brand. These systems are referred to as &quot;retro-clones&quot; or &quot;simulacra&quot;. Games not directly using rules of a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; edition but claiming to capture the style are often called Old School Renaissance (OSR) games.

The following retro-clones and OSR systems feature the owlbear as an opponent:

*&quot;Swords &amp; Wizardry&quot;, modelled after the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; from 1974 and published by Mythmere Games.
*&quot;Labyrinth Lord&quot; by Goblinoid Games.
*&quot;Dark Dungeons&quot;, &quot;Darker Dungeons&quot; and &quot;Darkest Dungeons&quot; (later renamed &quot;Blood, Guts and Glory&quot;) by Gratis Games all include the owlbear in their bestiary.
*&quot;OSRIC&quot;, a system emulating &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.
*&quot;Mazes &amp; Perils&quot;, inspired by the 1977 Holmes version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.
*&quot;Adventurer Conqueror King&quot; by Autarch.
*&quot;Dungeon Crawl Classics&quot; by Goodman Games.
*In &quot;Basic Fantasy&quot;, the owlbear appears together with the fire-breathing owlbear.
*&quot;Microlite74 Basic&quot;, &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Extended&quot; all have owlbears as monsters.
*&quot;For Gold &amp; Glory&quot;, emulating &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition.
*&quot;Castles &amp; Crusades&quot; by Troll Lord Games.
*&quot;Burning THAC0&quot;, a variation of &quot;The Burning Wheel&quot;.

===Other systems===
A male half-owlbear, half-blue dragon hybrid named Dragore is featured as an antagonist in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.0 supplement &quot;Foul Locales: Beyond the Walls&quot; by Mystic Eye Games.

The &quot;Manual of Monsters&quot; for &quot;&quot; suggest to use the owlbear as an opponent. A &quot;Warcraft&quot;-exclusive owlbear-like creature named wildkin is included as well.

Later on, &quot;Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game&quot; was renamed &quot;World of Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game&quot;. This edition&#x27;s &quot;Monster Guide&quot;, equivalent to the &quot;Manual of Monsters&quot;, includes the owlbear-like &quot;wildkin&quot; described as a benign creature and associated with the game&#x27;s Night Elf faction. A larger and more ferocious subtype listed is the &quot;owlbeast&quot;.

A third-party &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition quick reference card for the owlbear has been published as part of a series of &quot;Monster Knowledge Cards&quot;.

The owlbears appears in the &quot;HackMaster 4th edition Hacklopedia of Beasts Volume VI&quot; and the &quot;HackMaster 5th edition Hacklopedia of Beasts&quot;. Variants included are the lesser owlbear, great horned owlbear and the spotted owlbear.

The &quot;HackMaster&quot; adventure module &quot;Little Keep on the Borderlands&quot; features owlbears as enemies and an owlbear on the cover.

&quot;Blood &amp; Treasure&quot;, modelled after &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5 edition, features the owlbear as an opponent.

==In video games==
===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-licensed games===

Several video games based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; feature the owlbear:

* The owlbear appears as a regular enemy in the arcade beat &#x27;em up &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Tower of Doom&quot; as well as in its sequel &quot;Shadow over Mystara&quot;. The games were later re-released in a bundle for the Sega Saturn as the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Collection&quot;.

===&quot;Warcraft&quot; franchise===

Adaptations of the owlbear appear in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; universe in several forms:

* Non-player characters known as &quot;wildkin&quot; appear in &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; and its expansion &quot;The Frozen Throne&quot;. Variants are the &quot;enraged wildkin&quot; and &quot;berserk wildkin&quot;. The actual term &quot;owlbear&quot; is only used in &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; and its manual, and not used in its expansion.
* The MMORPG &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; contains a variety of owlbear-like creatures named &quot;wildkin&quot;, mostly as NPCs. The alternative term &quot;owlkin&quot; is used of wildkin living in the fictional Ammen Vale. A variant is the mutated owlkin. A more powerful wildkin is the owlbeast, with deranged owlbeast and raging owlbeast being subtypes. Some wildkin are also called &quot;moonkin&quot;, which is also a creature players of the druid class can transform into. A quest for players with the druid class involves defeating a moonkin named Lunaclaw.

<text>The Battle of Vercellae or Battle of the Raudine Plain was fought on 30 July 101 BC on a plain near Vercellae in Gallia Cisalpina (modern-day Northern Italy). A Celto-Germanic confederation under the command of the Cimbric king Boiorix was defeated by a Roman army under the joint command of the consul Gaius Marius and the proconsul Quintus Lutatius Catulus. The battle marked the end of the Germanic threat to the Roman Republic.

== Background ==
In 113 BC, a large migrating Germanic-Celtic alliance headed by the Cimbri and the Teutones entered the Roman sphere of influence. They invaded Noricum (located in present-day Austria and Slovenia) which was inhabited by the Taurisci people, friends and allies of Rome. The Senate commissioned Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, one of the consuls, to lead a substantial Roman army to Noricum to force the barbarians out. An engagement, later called the battle of Noreia, took place, in which the invaders completely overwhelmed the Roman Legions and inflicted a devastating loss on them.

After the Noreia victory, the Cimbri and Teutones moved westward towards Gaul. In 109 BC, they moved along the Rhodanus River towards the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul. The Roman consul, Marcus Junius Silanus, was sent to take care of the renewed Germanic threat. Silanus marched his army north along the Rhodanus River to confront the migrating Germanic tribes. He met the Cimbri approximately 100 miles north of Arausio where a battle was fought and the Romans suffered another humiliating defeat. The Germanic tribes then moved to the lands north and east of Tolosa in south-western Gaul.

To the Romans, the presence of the Germanic tribes in Gaul posed a serious threat to the stability in the area and to their prestige. Lucius Cassius Longinus, one of the consuls of 107 BC, was sent to Gaul at the head of another large army. He first fought the Cimbri and their Gallic allies the Volcae Tectosages just outside Tolosa, and despite the huge number of tribesmen, the Romans routed them. Unfortunately for the Romans, a few days later they were ambushed while marching on Burdigala. The Battle of Burdigala destroyed the Romans&#x27; hopes of definitively defeating the Cimbri and so the Germanic threat continued.

In 106 BC the Romans sent their largest army yet; the senior consul of that year, Quintus Servilius Caepio, was authorized to use eight legions in an effort to end the Germanic threat once and for all. While the Romans were busy getting their army together, the Volcae Tectosages had quarrelled with their Germanic guests, and had asked them to leave the area. When Caepio arrived he only found the local tribes and they sensibly decided not to fight the newly arrived legions. In 105 BC, Caepio&#x27;s command was prorogued and a further six legions were raised in Rome by Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, one of the consuls of 105 BC. Mallius Maximus led them to reinforce Caepio who was near Arausio. Unfortunately for the Romans, Caepio who was a patrician, and Mallius Maximus, who was a &#x27;new man&#x27;, clashed with each other. Caepio refused to take orders from Mallius Maximus who as consul outranked him. All this led to a divided Roman force with the two armies so uncooperative that they were unwilling to support each other when the fighting started. Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes had combined their forces. First they attacked and defeated Caepio&#x27;s army and then, with great confidence, took on Mallius Maximus&#x27;s army and defeated it too. The Battle of Arausio was considered the greatest Roman defeat since the slaughter suffered at the Battle of Cannae during the Punic Wars.

In 104 BC the Cimbri and the Teutones seemed to be heading for Italy. The Romans sent the senior consul of that year, Gaius Marius, a proven and capable general, at the head of another large army. The Germanic tribes never materialized so Marius subdued the Volcae Tectosages capturing their king Copillus. In 103 BC, Sulla, one of Marius&#x27;s lieutenants, succeeded in persuading the Germanic Marsi tribe to become friends and allies of Rome; they detached themselves from the Germanic confederation and went back to Germania. In 102 BC Marius marched against the Teutones and Ambrones in Gaul. Quintus Lutatius Catulus, Marius&#x27;s consular colleague, was tasked with keeping the Cimbri out of Italy. Catulus&#x27;s army suffered some losses when the Cimbri attacked him near Tridentum, but he retreated and kept his army intact. Meanwhile, Marius had completely defeated the Ambrones and the Teutones in a battle near Aquae Sextiae in Transalpine Gaul. In 101 BC the armies of Marius and Catulus joined forces and faced the Germanic invaders in Galia Cisalpina (Italian Gaul).

By July 101 BC the Cimbri were heading westwards along the banks of the Po River. Unfortunately for them, the armies of Marius and Catulus had merged and now camped around Placentia. Marius had been elected consul again (his fifth consulship) and was therefore in supreme command. He began negotiations with the Cimbri, who demanded land to settle on. Marius refused and instead sought to demoralize the Cimbri by parading captured Teuton nobles before them. Neither side genuinely sought negotiations; the Romans not intending to hand over their land to foreign invaders and the Cimbri believing themselves to be the superior force.

Over the next few days, the armies manoeuvred against each other, the Romans initially refusing to give battle. Eventually Marius chose the optimal location for the battle, an open plain (the Raudine Plain) near Vercellae, and then met with the Cimbri leader Boiorix to agree on the time and place of battle. Marius had some 52,000–54,000 men (mainly heavy infantry), the Cimbri had 120,000–180,000 warriors. (Modern historians are always somewhat sceptical about the overwhelming numbers the legions are reported to have fought, but there is no way to determine the true numbers today.)

== Prelude ==
Marius and Catulus had stationed their army in a defensible position near the River Po, to prevent the Cimbri from moving into Italy. The combined force was led by Marius who held senior rank. Seeing that the Cimbri were not advancing towards them, he crossed the river and neared their position. The Cimbri sent an embassage to the Roman camp. Marius offered battle, but the envoys refused, claiming they were waiting for their allies. They, in their turn, demanded land to be settled on for themselves and for their allies. Marius inquired as to which allies they were referring. The emissaries responded they meant the Teutones and/or Ambrones. Marius replied: &#x27;Then don&#x27;t trouble yourself with your brethren, for they have land, and they will have it forever – land which we have given them.&#x27; 
The Cimbri did not understand, therefore, Marius produced a number of captive Teutonic kings, possibly including Teutobod, from a nearby tent.

The envoys returned to the Cimbric camp and informed their leaders of the fate of their allies. The Cimbric king, Boiorix, convinced his people to fight the Romans as soon as possible as he wanted to settle the conflict sooner rather than later. Boiorix met with Marius and offered battle, he gave the Romans the choice of where and when the battle would take place. Marius informed the king that the Romans did not allow the enemy to dictate their military affairs. However, Marius, was willing to make an exception for the Cimbri. He instructed the king to meet him near Vercellae, also called the Raudian Plain.

== Location ==
Traditionally, most historians locate the site of the battle in or near the modern Vercelli, Piedmont, in northern Italy. Some historians think that &quot;vercellae&quot; is not a proper name and may refer to any mining area at the confluence of two rivers.

The latter historians think that the Cimbri followed the river Adige after having crossed the Brenner Pass, instead of &quot;unreasonably&quot; turning west to the modern Vercelli; this way, the location of the battle would be in the modern Polesine instead, possibly near the modern Rovigo. At Borgo Vercelli, near the river Sesia, 5 km from Vercelli, items have been found that supposedly strengthen the tradition.

Another suggested location is the hamlet of Roddi, in what is now the province of Cuneo, Piedmont.

==Battle==
On 30 July 101 BC, the Roman army marched onto the Raudine Plain. Marius split up his own 30,000–32,000 men strong army in two lots each forming the wings of the army while Catulus and his 20,000–24,000 less experienced troops formed the centre. Marius took command of the left wing, with Sulla commanding the cavalry on the extreme right. Marius had also very sensibly formed up his lines facing west, therefore the Cimbri had to fight with the morning sun in their eyes. The wind was blowing towards the enemy so any dust kicked up by their manoeuvering blew towards the Cimbri, impairing their eyesight. The Cimbri arrived second, marching onto the plain in a basic square formation with their warriors as deep as they were wide covering an area of over ten square miles. The 15,000 strong Cimbric cavalry rode in front of the square forming the vanguard.

According to Plutarch, Marius made a final sacrifice to the gods: &quot;Marius washed his hands, and lifting them up to heaven, vowed to make a sacrifice of 100 beasts should victory be his&quot; while Catulus promised the day&#x27;s spoils to the gods for their help.

The Romans took a position first and remained stationary, the sun reflected off their bronze helmets. Since the Romans held their position, the Cimbri had to come to them, forcing them to expend additional energy. Meanwhile, the sun kept reflecting off the Romans helmets giving the Cimbri the impression the sky was on fire, unnerving them. Sensing their anxiety, the Romans attacked. Marius led his wing against the Cimbri right. He marched into a huge dust cloud created by thousands of men on the move across dry fields. When he emerged, he did not find the enemy, the battle was taking place somewhere else. The Cimbri had launched themselves in a huge wedge towards Catulus&#x27;s centre, their cavalry to the front. The Cimbri cavalry then suddenly turned right hoping to draw the Romans out of their ordered ranks or trying to outflank them. Some of the legionaries fell for the ruse and pursued the Cimbri cavalry. While these legionaries were in pursuit, another segment of the Cimbri advanced and attacked the vulnerable and disorderly Romans. Unfortunately for the Cimbri, their horsemen were taken completely by surprise by the superior Roman cavalry under the command of Sulla. The Cimbri horses were forced back into the main body of their infantry, causing chaos. Seeing an opportunity, Catulus ordered his legions to advance and attack. When they reached the Cimbri they threw their pila into their disorganized ranks, the legionaries drew their swords and were soon in hand-to-hand combat. The other wings of the Roman army moved in on the Cimbri flanks, hemming them in. The Roman forces were smaller but more highly trained and disciplined. Furthermore, Roman legionaries excelled at close-quarters combat and, being so tightly packed, were in their element. The summer heat also worked against the barbarians who were not accustomed to fighting in these temperatures, unlike the Romans. The battle became a rout, stopped by the wagons drawn up (as was customary among Germanic and Celtic peoples) at the rear of the battlefield. At this point, the rout became a massacre that stopped only when the Cimbri began to surrender &quot;en masse&quot;. Boiorix and his noblemen made a last stand in which they were all killed. The Romans had won a complete and stunning victory.

==Aftermath==

The victory of Vercellae, following close on the heels of Marius&#x27; destruction of the Teutones at the Battle of Aquae Sextiae the previous year, put an end to the Germanic threat to Rome&#x27;s northern frontiers. The Cimbri were virtually wiped out, with Marius claiming to have killed 100,000 warriors and capturing and enslaving many thousands, including large numbers of women and children. Children of the surviving captives may have been among the rebelling gladiators in the Third Servile War.

The news of the decisive victory at Vercellae was brought to Rome by Marius&#x27;s brother-in-law, Gaius Julius Caesar (father of the famous Julius Caesar), who in the next year would become father to his only son.

Marius and Catulus were soon at odds with each other about who deserved the most credit. Marius tried to claim all the credit for the victory (which was his right as overall commander), but Catulus took citizens of nearby Parma to the battlefield and showed them the bodies of the Cimbri many of whom still had the pilums that killed them embedded in their corpses, and the vast majority of these pilums (pila) carried the markings of Catulus&#x27; legionaries.

Eventually, Marius and Catulus held a joint Triumph with Marius getting the most praise as overall commander.

Politically, this battle had great implications for Rome as well. The main reason (the Germanic threat) for Marius&#x27;s string of continuous consulships (104 BC-101BC) was gone. Although Marius, riding a wave of popularity after the Vercellae victory, was elected consul (for 100 BC) again, his political opponents exploited this. The end of the war also saw the beginning of a growing rivalry between Marius and Sulla, which would eventually lead to the first of Rome&#x27;s great civil wars. As a result of his role in the Vercellae victory Sulla&#x27;s prestige had risen considerably. Marius&#x27;s career was at its peak while Sulla&#x27;s was still on the rise.

Immediately after the battle Marius granted Roman citizenship to his Italian allied forces without consulting or asking permission from the Senate first. When some senators questioned this action, he would claim that in the heat of battle he could not distinguish the voice of a Roman from that of an ally. From that day, all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions.

This action by Marius was the first time a victorious general had openly defied the Senate but it would not be the last. In 88 BC, Sulla, in defiance of both the Senate and tradition, would lead his troops into the city of Rome itself. And Julius Caesar, when ordered by the Senate to lay down his command and return to Rome to face misconduct charges, would instead lead one of his legions across the Rubicon in 49 BC. This would mark the start of the civil war between himself and senatorial forces under Pompey which would lead to the end of the Roman Republic.

==In literature==
* Colleen McCullough describes the battle in some detail in her novel The First Man in Rome, the first book in her Masters of Rome series. Marius is one of the main characters and the novel focusses on his rise to power.

<text>Sheffield, Brightside was a parliamentary constituency in the City of Sheffield. Created for the 1885 general election, and replaced at the 2010 general election by the new constituency of Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, it elected one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, using the first-past-the-post voting system.

In its first fifty years, Brightside returned a variety of Liberal, Conservative and Labour MPs. However, from 1945 onwards, it became one of the Labour Party&#x27;s safest seats in the United Kingdom. It was represented by David Blunkett from 1987 until its abolition; he continued to hold the successor seat until he retired in 2015, becoming the seat&#x27;s longest-serving MP.

==Boundaries==
1885–1918: The Municipal Borough of Sheffield ward of Brightside.

1918–1950: The County Borough of Sheffield wards of Brightside and Burngreave.

1950–1955: The County Borough of Sheffield wards of Brightside, Firth Park, and Tinsley.

1955–1983: The County Borough of Sheffield wards of Brightside, Firth Park, Nether Shire, and Southey Green.

1983–2010: The City of Sheffield wards of Brightside, Firth Park, Nether Shire, Owlerton, and Southey Green.

Sheffield Brightside covered the north of the city. It bordered the constituencies of Rotherham, Sheffield Central, Sheffield Heeley and Sheffield Hillsborough.

Following their review of parliamentary representation in South Yorkshire, the Boundary Commission for England recommended that Sheffield Brightside should gain all of Burngreave and Hillsborough wards, with Walkley moving to Sheffield Central, and that the constituency be renamed Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough.

==History==
Sheffield Brightside was created in 1885 when the former Sheffield constituency was split into five constituencies.

<doc id="1187256" wikidata="Q5209706" url="?curid=1187256" title="Daisy Dormer">
<text>Daisy Dormer (born Kezia Beatrice Stockwell, 16 January 1883 – 13 September 1947) was a British music hall performer.

==Early life==
Kezia Beatrice Stockwell was born on 16 January 1883 in Southsea to Mary and Henry John Stockwell. Her father was a riveter at HM Dockyard Portsmouth. She began her stage career as a dancer in her home town at the age of six. She was pretty, slight and dark-haired and projected a figure of innocence.

==Career==
She started her performing career as Dainty Daisy Dimple and appeared in theatres and music halls under this name until February 1901, when she announced in &quot;The Era&quot; that she ‘will in future be known as Dainty Daisy Dormer’.

The song which launched her career was a Charles Collins and Tom Mellor composition, “I Wouldn’t Leave My Little Wooden Hut For You”, which she first sang in 1905.

A pretty, waif-like presence, Dormer sang &quot;After the Ball is Over&quot; among other popular songs. &quot;After the Ball is Over&quot;, which was written by Charles K. Harris, helped to establish Tin Pan Alley as a centre for the music business in the 1890s. The sheet music sold over five million copies in the 1890s.

==Pantomime==

Daisy had a long career in pantomime, appearing as Queen Zaza in &quot;Hop-O&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane production in 1911. The cast also included Barry Lupino, Will Evans, George Graves and Violet Loraine. In 1915, Daisy appeared as Principal Girl, Goody, in &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot; at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre, Park Row, Bristol. Lupino Lane was also in the cast.

== Film ==
Daisy appeared in only one silent film, &quot;Potted Pantomimes&quot;, directed by W.P. Kellino, starring famous stage star Lillian Russell and music hall comedians the Egbert Brothers made at Vaudefilms (Gaumont) Film Co in 1914.

She appeared in one talkie playing the role of Mrs. Deakin in &quot;City of Beautiful Nonsense&quot; with Emlyn Williams in 1935.

==Personal life==
She married Albert Jee in April 1908, better known by his stage name, Albert Egbert, one-half of the Egbert Brothers. They ran The Sun Hotel in Godalming.

==Death==
Daisy Dormer died at her home in Clapham, London on 13 September 1947. She was cremated at Streatham Park Cemetery.

Her name is commemorated by Daisy Dormer Court on the Trinity Gardens estate in Brixton.

== Works ==

<doc id="1187265" wikidata="Q1574420" url="?curid=1187265" title="Supreme Court of Norway">
<text>The Supreme Court of Norway (Norwegian Bokmål: ; Norwegian Nynorsk: ; lit. &#x27;Highest Court&#x27;) is the highest court in the Norwegian judiciary. It was established in 1815 on the basis of section 88 in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway, which prescribed an independent judiciary. It is located in the capital Oslo. In addition to serving as the court of final appeal for civil and criminal cases, it can also rule whether the Cabinet has acted in accordance with Norwegian law and whether the Parliament has passed legislation consistent with the Constitution.

==Appointment process==

Section 21 of the Norwegian Constitution grants the King of Norway sole authority to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. In Norwegian tradition, however, this section is interpreted as delegating the privilege to the Council of State, i.e. the cabinet. The cabinet makes their appointments on the advice of the Judicial Appointments Board, a body whose members are also appointed by the Council of State.

==Information==
The Supreme Court is Norway&#x27;s highest court. It has the entire Kingdom as its jurisdiction. It is a court of appeal, i.e. cases cannot be brought before the court if they have not been tried in a district court () and in most cases also in a regional court (). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has the prerogative to decide itself which cases of appeal it shall hear. This leads the court to hear cases of principal importance, where clarification is needed or where standards need to be set. Rulings set substantial precedence for the lower courts as well as for the Supreme Court itself.

As a subject to Norwegian law, one has no right to be heard in the Supreme Court, as the universal Human Rights article on a fair trial is believed to be satisfied with the district courts and as courts of appeal the regional courts.

The Supreme Court has a committee consisting of three justices who decide what cases shall be tried in the Supreme Court. The same committee decides in procedural questions appealed from the lower courts. Once approved, the case is heard and decided by 5 justices. A case may be decided in grand chamber, set with 11 justices, if the court decides that clear precedence needs to be set. In rare circumstances, a case may be heard in plenary session by all 20 justices. This happens when the court needs to decide if legislation conflicts with the constitution or a case involves fundamental questions.

The court is chaired by a Chief Justice together with 19 other justices. The current Chief Justice is Toril Marie Øie.

To be eligible to apply for the position as a Supreme Court justice, the Constitution of Norway states that one must be a Norwegian citizen, have a law degree with excellent academic record and be at least 30 years old. Justice may only be removed by impeachment through conviction in the Riksrett. As of 2013, this has never happened. Justices face mandatory retirement at age 70.

The court&#x27;s salary is regulated by the Storting. Since October 1, 2011, justices have been paid NOK 1,487,000 ($262,600) and the chief justice NOK 1,724,000 ($304,500).

<doc id="1187268" wikidata="Q2666479" url="?curid=1187268" title="Rational agent">
<text>A rational agent or rational being is a person or entity that always aims to perform optimal actions based on given premises and information. A rational agent can be anything that makes decisions, typically a person, firm, machine, or software.

The concept of rational agents can be found in various disciplines such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, decision theory, economics, ethics, game theory, and the study of practical reason.

==Economics==

In reference to economics, rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a free market. This concept is one of the assumptions made in neoclassical economic theory. The concept of economic rationality arises from a tradition of marginal analysis used in neoclassical economics. The idea of a rational agent is important to the philosophy of utilitarianism, as detailed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s theory of the felicific calculus, also known as the hedonistic calculus.

The action a rational agent takes depends on:
* the preferences of the agent
* the agent&#x27;s information of its environment, which may come from past experiences
* the actions, duties and obligations available to the agent
* the estimated or actual benefits and the chances of success of the actions.

In game theory and classical economics, it is often assumed that the actors, people, and firms are rational. However, the extent to which people and firms behave rationally is subject to debate. Economists often assume the models of rational choice theory and bounded rationality to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals and firms. Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-intuitive to many people, as in the traveler&#x27;s dilemma.

=== Alternate theories ===
Neuroeconomics is a concept that uses neuroscience, social psychology and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions. Unlike rational agent theory, neuroeconomics does not attempt to predict large-scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case-by-case scenarios.

==Artificial intelligence==
Artificial intelligence has borrowed the term &quot;rational agents&quot; from economics to describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior. Today there is a considerable overlap between AI research, game theory and decision theory. Rational agents in AI are closely related to &quot;intelligent agents&quot;, autonomous software programs that display intelligence.

<doc id="1187277" wikidata="Q2131030" url="?curid=1187277" title="Thesaurus Linguae Graecae">
<text>The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) is a research center at the University of California, Irvine. The TLG was founded in 1972 by Marianne McDonald (a graduate student at the time and now a professor of theater and classics at the University of California, San Diego) with the goal to create a comprehensive digital collection of all surviving texts written in Greek from antiquity to the present era. Since 1972, the TLG has collected and digitized most surviving literary texts written in Greek from Homer to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE, and beyond. Theodore Brunner (1934–2007) directed the project from 1972 until his retirement from the University of California in 1998. Maria Pantelia, also a classics professor at UC Irvine, succeeded Theodore Brunner in 1998, and has been directing the TLG since. TLG&#x27;s name is shared with its online database, the full title of which is &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: A Digital Library of Greek Literature&quot; (the &quot;TLG&quot;, in italics, for short).

The challenge of this huge undertaking was originally met with the help of several classicists and technology experts but primarily thanks to the efforts of David W. Packard and his team who created the Ibycus system, the hardware and software originally used to proofread and search the corpus. Packard also developed Beta code, a character and formatting encoding convention used to encode Polytonic Greek. The collection was originally circulated on CD-ROM. The first CD-ROM was released in 1985, and was the first compact disc that did not contain music. Subsequent versions were released in 1988 and in 1992, thanks to technical support provided by Packard.

By the late 1990s, it became obvious that the old Ibycus technology was outdated. Under the direction of Professor Maria Pantelia, a number of new projects were undertaken, including the massive migration out of Ibycus, the development of a new system to digitize, proofread, and manage the textual collection, a new CD-ROM (TLG E), released in 1999, and eventually the move of the corpus to the web environment in 2001. At the same time, the TLG started working with the Unicode Technical Committee to include all characters needed to encode and display Greek in the Unicode standard. The corpus continues to be expanded significantly to include Byzantine, medieval, and eventually modern Greek texts. More recent projects include the lemmatization of the Greek corpus (2006) – a substantial undertaking, given the highly inflected nature of Greek and the complexity of the corpus, covering more than two millennia of literary development – and the Online Liddell–Scott–Jones &quot;Greek–English Lexicon&quot; (commonly referred to as the LSJ), released in February 2011.

Since 2001, the TLG corpus has been searchable online by members of subscribing institutions, which number close to 1500 worldwide. All bibliographical information and a subset of the texts are available to the general public.

The number of Greek words in the corpus amounts to 110 million, while the number of unique wordforms amount to 1.6 million and the number of unique lemmata to 250,000.

<doc id="1187279" wikidata="Q3234153" url="?curid=1187279" title="Islam in Bangladesh">
<text>Islam is the largest and the state religion of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. According to the 2022 census, Bangladesh had a population of about 150 million Muslims, or 91.04% of its total population of million. Muslims of Bangladesh are predominant native Bengali Muslims. The majority of Bangladeshis are &quot;Sunni&quot;, and follow the &quot;Hanafi&quot; school of &quot;Fiqh&quot;. Bangladesh is a &quot;de facto&quot; secular country.

The Bengal region was a supreme power of the medieval Islamic East. In the late 7th century, Muslims from Arabia established commercial as well as religious connection within the Bengal region before the conquest, mainly through the coastal regions as traders and primarily via the ports of Chittagong. In the early 13th century, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji conquered Western and part of Northern Bengal and established the first Muslim kingdom in Bengal. During the 13th century, Sufi missionaries, mystics and saints began to preach Islam in villages. The Islamic Bengal Sultanate was founded by Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah who united Bengal on an ethno-linguistic platform. Bengal reached in her golden age during Bengal Sultanate&#x27;s prosperous ruling period. Subsequently, Bengal viceroy Muhammad Azam Shah assumed the imperial throne. Mughal Bengal became increasingly independent under the Nawabs of Bengal in the 18th century.

== History ==
=== Early explorers ===
One of the earliest mosques in South Asia is under excavation in northern Bangladesh, indicating the presence of Muslims in the area around the lifetime of Muhammad. By the 9th century, Muslim merchants had increased trade with Bengali seaports, introducing Islam to the region. Coins from the Abbasid era have been discovered across Bengal, further evidencing this connection. Additional evidence of these early Arab traders includes inscriptions found near the Meghna River close to Sandwip on the Bay of Bengal. Arab writers of the time also mentioned the kingdoms of Samrup and Rumi, the latter being identified with the empire of Dharmapal of the Pala Empire.

In the 10th century, Samatata, located in southeastern Bengal, was home to a diverse population with various religious backgrounds. During this period, the Arab geographer Al-Masudi visited the region and documented a thriving Muslim community in his work &quot;The Meadows of Gold.&quot; Islam first appeared in Bengal during Pala dynasty&#x27;s rule, as a result of increased trade between Bengal and the Arab Abbasid Caliphate, facilitating the presence of Arab traders along the coast of Bengal which includes Port of Chittagong.

In addition to trade, Islam was also being introduced to the people of Bengal through the migration of Sufi missionaries prior to conquests. The earliest known Sufi missionaries were Syed Shah Surkhul Antia and his students, most notably Shah Sultan Rumi, in the 11th century. Rumi settled in present-day Netrokona, Mymensingh where he influenced the local ruler and population to embrace Islam.

The first Muslim conquest of Bengal was undertaken by the forces of General Bakhtiyar Khilji in the thirteenth century. This opened the doors for Muslim influence in the region for hundreds of years up until the present-day. Many of the people of Bengal began accepting Islam through the influx of missionaries following this conquest. Sultan Balkhi and Shah Makhdum Rupos settled in the present-day Rajshahi Division in northern Bengal, preaching to the communities there. Numerous small sultanates emerged in the region. During the reign of the Sultan of Lakhnauti Shamsuddin Firuz Shah, much of present-day Satgaon, Sonargaon and Mymensingh came under Muslim dominion. A community of 13 Muslim families headed by Burhanuddin resided in the northeastern city of Srihatta (Sylhet), claiming their descendants to have arrived from Chittagong. Srihatta (Sylhet) was ruled by an oppressive king called Gour Govinda. After being informed of Raja Gour Govinda&#x27;s oppressive regime in Sylhet, Firuz Shah sent numerous forces led by his nephew Sikandar Khan Ghazi and subsequently his military commander-in-chief Syed Nasiruddin to conquer Sylhet. By 1303, over three hundred Sufi preachers led by Shah Jalal aided the conquest and confirmed a victory. Following the conquest, Jalal disseminated his followers across different parts of Bengal to spread Islam. Jalal is now a household name among Muslims in Bangladesh.

=== Sultanate of Bengal ===

The establishment of a single united Bengal Sultanate in 1352 by Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah finally gave rise to a &quot;Bengali&quot; socio-linguistic and cultural identity. The Ilyas Shahi dynasty highly acknowledged Muslim scholarship. Usman Serajuddin, also known as &quot;Akhi Siraj Bengali&quot;, was a native of Gaur in western Bengal and became the Sultanate&#x27;s court scholar during Ilyas Shah&#x27;s reign. The sovereign Sunni Muslim nation-state also enabled the language of the Bengali people to gain patronage and support, contrary to previous states which exclusively favoured Sanskrit, Pali and Persian. The converted Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah funded the construction of Islamic seminaries as far as Mecca and Madina in the Middle East. The people of Arabia came to know these institutions as al-Madaris al-Bangaliyyah (&quot;Bengali madrasas&quot;).

Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta&#x27;s diary is one of the best known accounts of the prelude to the Bengal Sultanate. Ibn Battuta visited Bengal during the reign of Sultan Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah, a rebel governor of the Delhi Sultanate who established a city state in Sonargaon. At the time, Bengal was divided into the three city states of Sonargaon, Satgaon and Lakhnauti. In 1352, the three city states were united by Ilyas Shah into a single, unitary, independent Bengal Sultanate. The creation of the Bengal Sultanate sparked several Bengal-Delhi Wars, which resulted in Delhi recognizing Bengal&#x27;s independence. The Ilyas Shahi dynasty consolidated Bengali statehood, the economy and diplomatic relations. A network of Mint Towns - provincial capitals which produced the Sultan&#x27;s sovereign currency called the &quot;taka&quot; - was established across Bengal. The Bengali state followed the Persian model of statecraft. Muslims from other parts of the world were imported for military, bureaucratic and household services. These immigrants included Turks from northern India who were originally recruited in Central Asia; as well as Abyssinians imported via East Africa into the Bengali port of Chittagong. A highly commercialized and monetized economy evolved. Islamic architecture was introduced on a major scale. A huge mosque called the Adina Mosque was built following the design of the Great Mosque of Damascus. A distinct Bengali Muslim architectural style developed, with terracotta and stone buildings showing a fusion of Persian and Bengali elements. Mosques included two categories, including multi-domed rectangular structures and single-domed square structures. A distinct style of Bengali &quot;mihrabs&quot;, &quot;minbars&quot;, terracotta arabesque, and &quot;do-chala&quot; roofs developed; this influence also spread to other regions.

The Bengal Sultanate was ruled by five dynastic periods, with each period have a particular ethnic identity. The Ilyas Shahi dynasty was of Turkic origin. It was replaced by the Bengali-origin dynasty of Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah and Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah for a few decades before being restored. In the 1490s, a series of Abyssinian generals took turns in becoming the Sultan of Bengal. They were succeeded by the Hussain Shahi dynasty which was of Arab origin. They were in turn replaced by the Pashtun rulers of the Suri dynasty, who first acted as regional governors before restoring Bengali independence. The last dynasty, the Karrani dynasty, was also of Pashtun origin. The sultanate period saw a flourishing of Islamic scholarship and the development of Bengali literature. Scholars, writers and poets of sultanate-era Bengal included Usman Serajuddin, Alaul Haq, Sheikh Nur Qutb Alam, Alaol, Shah Muhammad Sagir, Abdul Hakim, Syed Sultan, Qadi Ruknu&#x27;d-Din Abu Hamid Muhammad bin Muhammad al-&#x27;Amidi, Abu Tawwama, Syed Ibrahim Danishmand, Syed Arif Billah Muhammad Kamel and Syed Muhammad Yusuf among others. Bengal&#x27;s tradition of Persian prose was acknowledged by Hafez. The &quot;Dobhashi&quot; tradition saw Bengali transliteration of Arabic and Persian words in Bengali script to illustrate Islamic epics and stories.

During the independent sultanate period, Bengal forged strong diplomatic relations with empires outside the subcontinent. The most notable of these relationships was with Ming China and its emperor Yongle. At least a dozen embassies were exchanged between China and Bengal. The Sultan of Bengal even gifted an East African giraffe to the Emperor of China as a tribute to China-Bengal relations. The Chinese Muslim admiral Zheng He visited Bengal as an envoy of the Emperor of China. Bengali ships transported the embassies of Sumatra, Brunei and Malacca to the port of Canton. China and the Timurid ruler of Herat mediated an end to the Bengal Sultanate-Jaunpur Sultanate War. The Sultan of Bengal also acknowledged the nominal authority of the Abbasid caliph in Cairo. The Portuguese was the first European state entity to establish relations with the Bengal Sultanate. The Bengal Sultan permitted the opening of the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong.

During the Sultanate period, a syncretic belief system arose due to mass conversions. As a result, the Islamic concept of &quot;tawhid&quot; (the oneness of God) was diluted into the veneration of saints or &quot;pirs&quot;. Deities such as Shitala (goddess of smallpox), Olabibi (goddess of cholera) and Manasa (goddess of snakes) became venerated as &quot;pirs&quot;.

===Under Mughal Empire===
In pre-Mughal times, there is less evidence for widespread adoption of Islam in what is now Bangladesh. What mention of Muslims there was usually in reference to an urban elite. Ibn Battuta met with Shah Jalal in Sylhet and noted the inhabitants of the plains were still Hindu. In 1591, Venetian traveller Cesare Federici mentioned Sondwip near Chittagong as having an entirely Muslim population. The seventeenth century European travellers generally understood Islam as being implanted after the Mughal conquest.

During the Mughal Empire, much of the region of what is now East Bengal was still heavily forested, but highly fertile. The Mughals incentivised the bringing of this land under cultivation, and so peasants were incentivised to bring the land under cultivation. These peasants were primarily led by Muslim leaders and so Islam became the main religion in the delta. Most of the Zamindars in the modern Barisal division, for instance, were upper caste Hindus who subcontracted actual jungle clearance work to a Muslim pir. In other instances, pirs themselves would organise the locals to clear the jungle and then contact the Mughals to gain legitimacy. In other instances, such as the densely-forested interior of Chittagong, Muslims came from indigenous tribals who never followed Hindu rituals.

===In British India===

The British East India Company was given the right to collect revenue from Bengal and Bihar by the Treaty of Allahabad after defeating the combined armies of Nawab Mir Qasim of Bengal, Nawab of Awadh, and Mughal emperor at the Battle of Buxar. They annexed Bengal in 1793 after abolishing local rule (Nizamat). The British looted the Bengal treasury, appropriating wealth valued at US$40 billion in modern-day prices. Due to high colonial taxation, Bengali commerce shrank by 50% within 40 years, while at the same time British imports flooded the market. Spinners and weavers starved during famines and Bengal&#x27;s once industrious cities became impoverished. The East India Company forced opium and indigo cultivation and the permanent settlement dismantled centuries of joint Muslim-Hindu political, military and feudal cooperation.

The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765. Rural eastern Bengal witnessed the earliest rebellions against British rule, including the Faraizi movement led by Haji Shariatullah and the activities of Titumir and Karamat Ali Jaunpuri. The mutiny of 1857 engulfed much of northern India and Bengal, including in Dhaka and Chittagong. Following the end of the mutiny, the British Government took direct control of Bengal from the East India Company and instituted the British Raj. The influence of Christian missionaries increased during this period. To counter this trend, Reazuddin Ahmad Mashadi, Muhammad Reazuddin Ahmad of the &quot;Sudhakar&quot; newspaper and Munshi Mohammad Meherullah played prominent roles.

The colonial capital Calcutta, where Bengali Muslims formed the second largest community, became the second largest city in the British Empire after London. The late 19th and early 20th-century Indian Renaissance brought dramatic social and political change. The introduction of Western law, government and education introduced modern enlightenment values which created a new politically conscious middle class and a new generation of leaders in science, politics and the arts. The First Partition of Bengal incubated the broader anti-colonial struggle and in 1906 the All India Muslim League was formed during the Muhammadan Education Conference in Dhaka. During this period a Muslim middle class emerged and the University of Dhaka played a role at the beginning of the emancipation of Bengali Muslim society, which was also marked by the emergence progressive groups like the Freedom of Intellect Movement and the Muslim Literary Society. Bengali Muslims were at the forefront of the Indian Independence Movement, including the Pakistan Movement.

===Bangladesh War of Independence===

Islamic sentiments powered the definition of nationhood in the 1940s, when Bengali people united with Muslims in other parts of the subcontinent to form Pakistan. In the 70s, the society they then envisioned was based on principles such as socialism, nationalism and democracy. While Islam was still a part of faith and culture, it was no longer the only factor that formed national identity.

Bangladesh was established as a constitutionally secular state and the Bangladeshi constitution enshrined secular, socialist and democratic principles.

==Denominations==

===Sunni===

Majority of the Muslims in Bangladesh are &quot;Sunni&quot;, who mainly follow the &quot;Hanafi&quot; school of Islamic jurisprudence and the &quot;Maturidi&quot; school of theology. 

===Small minorities===

There are also few Shi&#x27;a Muslims, particularly belonging to the Bihari community. The Shi&#x27;a observance commemorating the martyrdom of Ali&#x27;s sons, Hasan and Husayn, are still widely observed by the nation&#x27;s Sunnis, even though there are small numbers of Shi&#x27;as. Among the Shias, the Dawoodi Bohra community is concentrated in Chittagong.

Those who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, are present in Bangladesh, though having not expressed publicly but are active virtually due to fear of gruesome persecution considering the present political situation. The Ahmadiyya community, which is widely considered to be non-Muslim by mainstream Muslim leaders, is estimated to be around 100,000, the community has faced discrimination because of their beliefs and have been persecuted in some areas. There is a very small community of Bangladeshis whom are adherents to the Mahdavia creed. There are some people who do not identify themselves with any sect and just call themselves Muslims.

==Demography==

The population of Bangladesh have gone up from 28.92 million in 1901 to 150.36 million in 2022, as per as statistics the same way the high fertility rate among Muslims have led to over population of the country as according to census, Muslim population have gone up from 19.12 million in 1901 to 150.36 million in 2022. The Muslim percentage have also got increased from 66.1% in 1901 to 91.04% in 2022. Socio-Economic and Demographic Survey 2023 Report of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics estimates the Muslim share 91.58% of the population.


Estimation shows that over 1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees live in Bangladesh who have came here during the period of (2016–17) crisis. On 28 September 2018, at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said there are 1.1-1.3 million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh.

According to Pew research center, Muslim population of Bangladesh will reach 218.5-237.5 million by the year 2050, and will constitute overwhelming 95% of the country&#x27;s population, thus making the country 4th largest Muslim populated around that time.
===Islam by Districts===
== Islamic culture in Bangladesh ==

Although Islam played a significant role in the life and culture of the people, religion did not dominate national politics because Islam was not the central component of national identity. When in June 1988 an &quot;Islamic way of life&quot; was proclaimed for Bangladesh by constitutional amendment, very little attention was paid outside the intellectual class to the meaning and impact of such an important national commitment. However, most observers believed that the declaration of Islam as the state religion might have a significant impact on national life. Aside from arousing the suspicion of the non-Islamic minorities, it could accelerate the proliferation of religious parties at both the national and the local levels, thereby exacerbating tension and conflict between secular and religious politicians. Unrest of this nature was reported on some college campuses soon after the amendment was promulgated.

== Law and politics ==
===Legal issues===
In Bangladesh, where a modified Anglo-Indian civil and criminal legal system operates, there are no official sharia courts. Most Muslim marriages, however, are presided over by the &quot;qazi&quot;, a traditional Muslim judge whose advice is also sought on matters of personal law, such as inheritance, divorce, and the administration of religious endowments.

The inheritance rights of Muslim in Bangladesh are governed by The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act (1937) and The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (1961). Article 2 of The Muslim Personal Law Application Act provides that questions related to succession and inheritance are governed by Muslim Personal Law (Shariat).
Article 2 proclaims: &quot;any custom or usage to the contrary, in all questions (save questions relating to agricultural land) regarding intestate succession, special property of females, including personal property inherited or obtained under contract or gift or any other provision of Personal Law, marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq, ila, zihar, lian, khula and mubaraat, maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and trust properties, and waqfs (other than charities and charitable institutions and charitable and religious endowments) the rule of decision in cases where the parties are Muslims shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat).&quot;

===Political issues===
Post-1971 regimes sought to increase the role of the government in the religious life of the people. The Ministry of Religious Affairs provided support, financial assistance, and endowments to religious institutions, including mosques and community prayer grounds (Idgahs). The organization of Hajj also came under the auspices of the ministry because of limits on the number of pilgrims admitted by the government of Saudi Arabia and the restrictive foreign exchange regulations of the government of Bangladesh. The ministry also directed the policy and the program of the Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, which was responsible for organizing and supporting research and publications on Islamic subjects. The foundation also maintains the Baitul Mukarram (National Mosque), and organized the training of imams. Some 18,000 imams were scheduled for training once the government completed establishment of a national network of Islamic cultural centers and mosque libraries. Under the patronage of the Islamic Foundation, an encyclopedia of Islam in the Bengali language was being compiled in the late 1980s.

Another step toward further government involvement in religious life was taken in 1984 when the semi-official Zakat Fund Committee was established under the chairmanship of the president of Bangladesh. The committee solicited annual zakat contributions on a voluntary basis. The revenue so generated was to be spent on orphanages, schools, children&#x27;s hospitals, and other charitable institutions and projects. Commercial banks and other financial institutions were encouraged to contribute to the fund. Through these measures the government sought closer ties with religious establishments within the country and with Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.

==Leaders and organizations==

The members of the Ulama include Mawlānā, Imams, Ulama and Muftis. The first two titles are accorded to those who have received special training in Islamic theology and law. A maulvi has pursued higher studies in a madrassa, a school of religious education attached to a mosque. Additional study on the graduate level leads to the title Mawlānā.

===Educational institutions===
The madrassas are also divided in two mainstreams; Alia Madrasah and Qawmi Madrasah.

== Status of religious freedom ==

The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion but upholds the right to practice—subject to law, public order, and morality—the religion of one&#x27;s choice. The Government generally respects this provision in practice. The Government (2001–2006) led by an alliance of four parties Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, Islami Oikya Jote and Bangladesh Jatiyo Party banned Ahmadiya literature by an executive order. However, the government, led by Bangladesh Awami League strongly propagates secularism and respect towards other religions. Despite all Bangladeshis saying that religion is an important part of their daily lives, Bangladesh&#x27;s Awami League won a landslide victory in 2008 on a platform of secularism, reform, and a suppression of radical Islamist groups. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2009, simultaneous strong support of the secular Awami League and the near unanimous importance of religion in daily life suggests that while religion is vital in Bangladeshis&#x27; daily lives, they appear comfortable with its lack of influence in government. The current interim government led by Muhammad Yunus also propagates secularism. 

In Bangladesh, the International Crimes Tribunal tried and convicted several leaders of the Islamic Razakar militias, as well as Bangladesh Muslim Awami league (Forid Uddin Mausood), of war crimes committed against Hindus during the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. The charges included forced conversion of Bengali Hindus to Islam.

<text>Bounty Bay is an embayment of the Pacific Ocean into Pitcairn Island. It is named after the &quot;Bounty&quot;, a British naval vessel whose eighteenth-century mutiny was immortalized in the novel &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, and the numerous subsequent motion pictures made of it. The mutineers sailed the &quot;Bounty&quot; to Pitcairn Island and destroyed it by fire in the bay. Current Pitcairn Islanders are largely patrilineal descendants of the mutineers and their Tahitian wives, as exhibited by some of their surnames. 

Travellers to Pitcairn are usually brought by longboat into Bounty Bay.

<text>SSL International plc was a British manufacturer of healthcare products. Its best known brands were Durex and Scholl; other significant brands were Sauber and Mister Baby. The company&#x27;s name was an abbreviation of &quot;Seton Scholl London International&quot;, its predecessor businesses. The company was founded in 1929 and was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In November 2010, SSL International was folded into Reckitt.

==Background==

===Scholl plc===

Dr. Scholl&#x27;s was founded in 1906, by Chicago-based podiatrist William M Scholl. Opening its first shop in London in 1913, after the death of Dr Scholl it was listed publicly on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972, and became a member of the Fortune 500. Bought by Schering-Plough in 1978, the company sold the global brand and non-North American operations to Basingstoke-based home appliance electrical manufacturer European Home Products in 1984.

===London Rubber Company===
The London Rubber Company was founded in 1915 by LA Jackson, selling imported condoms and barber shop supplies. Subsequently renamed London International Group (LIG) plc, it developed a consumer based product portfolio, spanning health and beauty products including Durex, medical markets with Regent surgical gloves, and business-to-business with Marigold Industrial Gloves.

===Seton Healthcare plc===
Seton Healthcare plc was founded in 1952 by Ivor Stoller, selling tubular bandages. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1990 and, in 1992, it added over the counter consumer drugs to its portfolio when it bought Blackburn-based patent medicines maker Cupal - and with it brands including Cuprofen, Full Marks Mousse and Meltus - for the equivalent of $12.4 million, as well as acquiring the rights to manufacture and market Betadine antiseptics.

==Merger of Seton and Scholl==
In July 1998, Scholl and Seton merged to become Seton Scholl plc. In 1999, Seton Scholl and LIG merged to become &quot;Seton Scholl London International Group plc,&quot; shortened to SSL International. The integration of these two businesses was led by Stuart Wallis, the first chairman of SSL, who left the company in 2001.

From 2002 to 2004 the company disposed of its medical and industrial products to focus on its two main brands as part of a &quot;strategic repositioning&quot;. The first major diversification was of 21 OTC brands to Thornton &amp; Ross Limited in March 2002. Marigold Industrial Gloves was sold to Comasec SAS in November 2003. The wound management products were sold to Medlock Medical Limited (owned by Apax Partners) in May 2004. Regent Infection Control (makers of Biogel surgical gloves and Hibi antiseptics) was also sold to a business owned by Apax Partners in May 2004 for £173 million. The final sale was of the minor Silipos business to Langer Inc in October 2004.

In November 2007 the company acquired &quot;Orthaheel&quot;, an Australian business selling insoles designed and marketed by podiatrist Phillip Vasyli.
In 2008, the company acquired Crest Condoms, a Swiss based condom brand.

==Takeover==
By the beginning of 2010, the company was listed on the FTSE 250, and had a commercial presence in over thirty countries, and manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom, Spain, China, India, Thailand and CIS. In July 2010, SSL agreed to be bought by household products company Reckitt in a £2.5 billion deal. The takeover was completed in November 2010 and SSL was then folded into Reckitt.

<text>Belief revision (also called belief change) is the process of changing beliefs to take into account a new piece of information. The logical formalization of belief revision is researched in philosophy, in databases, and in artificial intelligence for the design of rational agents.

What makes belief revision non-trivial is that several different ways for performing this operation may be possible. For example, if the current knowledge includes the three facts &quot;formula_1 is true&quot;, &quot;formula_2 is true&quot; and &quot;if formula_1 and formula_2 are true then formula_5 is true&quot;, the introduction of the new information &quot;formula_5 is false&quot; can be done preserving consistency only by removing at least one of the three facts. In this case, there are at least three different ways for performing revision. In general, there may be several different ways for changing knowledge.

==Revision and update==
Two kinds of changes are usually distinguished:

; update : the new information is about the situation at present, while the old beliefs refer to the past; update is the operation of changing the old beliefs to take into account the change;

; revision : both the old beliefs and the new information refer to the same situation; an inconsistency between the new and old information is explained by the possibility of old information being less reliable than the new one; revision is the process of inserting the new information into the set of old beliefs without generating an inconsistency.

The main assumption of belief revision is that of minimal change: the knowledge before and after the change should be as similar as possible. In the case of update, this principle formalizes the assumption of inertia. In the case of revision, this principle enforces as much information as possible to be preserved by the change.

===Example===
The following classical example shows that the operations to perform in the two settings of update and revision are not the same. The example is based on two different interpretations of the set of beliefs formula_7 and the new piece of information formula_8:

; update : in this scenario, two satellites, Unit A and Unit B, orbit around Mars; the satellites are programmed to land while transmitting their status to Earth; and Earth has received a transmission from one of the satellites, communicating that it is still in orbit. However, due to interference, it is not known which satellite sent the signal; subsequently, Earth receives the communication that Unit A has landed. This scenario can be modeled in the following way: two propositional variables formula_9 and formula_10 indicate that Unit A and Unit B, respectively, are still in orbit; the initial set of beliefs is formula_7 (either one of the two satellites is still in orbit) and the new piece of information is formula_8 (Unit A has landed, and is therefore not in orbit). The only rational result of the update is formula_8; since the initial information that one of the two satellites had not landed yet was possibly coming from the Unit A, the position of the Unit B is not known.

; revision : the play &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; will be performed in one of the two local theatres. This information can be denoted by formula_7, where formula_9 and formula_10 indicates that the play will be performed at the first or at the second theatre, respectively; a further information that &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; will be performed at the first theatre indicates that formula_8 holds. In this case, the obvious conclusion is that &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; will be performed at the second but not the first theatre, which is represented in logic by formula_18.

This example shows that revising the belief formula_19 with the new information formula_8 produces two different results formula_21 and formula_18 depending on whether the setting is that of update or revision.

==Contraction, expansion, revision, consolidation, and merging==
In the setting in which all beliefs refer to the same situation, a distinction between various operations that can be performed is made:

; contraction : removal of a belief;

; expansion : addition of a belief without checking consistency;

; revision : addition of a belief while maintaining consistency;

; extraction : extracting a consistent set of beliefs and/or epistemic entrenchment ordering;

; consolidation : restoring consistency of a set of beliefs;

; merging : fusion of two or more sets of beliefs while maintaining consistency.

Revision and merging differ in that the first operation is done when the new belief to incorporate is considered more reliable than the old ones; therefore, consistency is maintained by removing some of the old beliefs. Merging is a more general operation, in that the priority among the belief sets may or may not be the same.

Revision can be performed by first incorporating the new fact and then restoring consistency via consolidation. This is actually a form of merging rather than revision, as the new information is not always treated as more reliable than the old knowledge.

==The AGM postulates==
The AGM postulates (named after their proponents Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson) are properties that an operator that performs revision should satisfy in order for that operator to be considered rational. The considered setting is that of revision, that is, different pieces of information referring to the same situation. Three operations are considered: expansion (addition of a belief without a consistency check), revision (addition of a belief while maintaining consistency), and contraction (removal of a belief).

The first six postulates are called &quot;the basic AGM postulates&quot;. In the settings considered by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson, the current set of beliefs is represented by a deductively closed set of logical formulae formula_23 called belief set, the new piece of information is a logical formula formula_24, and revision is performed by a binary operator formula_25 that takes as its operands the current beliefs and the new information and produces as a result a belief set representing the result of the revision. The formula_26 operator denoted expansion: formula_27 is the deductive closure of formula_28. The AGM postulates for revision are:

# Closure: formula_29 is a belief set (i.e., a deductively closed set of formulae);
# Success: formula_30
# Inclusion: formula_31
# Vacuity: formula_32
# Consistency: formula_29 is inconsistent only if formula_24 is inconsistent
# Extensionality: formula_35 (see logical equivalence)
# Superexpansion: formula_36
# Subexpansion: formula_37

A revision operator that satisfies all eight postulates is the full meet revision, in which formula_29 is equal to formula_27 if consistent, and to the deductive closure of formula_24 otherwise. While satisfying all AGM postulates, this revision operator has been considered to be too conservative, in that no information from the old knowledge base is maintained if the revising formula is inconsistent with it.

==Conditions equivalent to the AGM postulates==
The AGM postulates are equivalent to several different conditions on the revision operator; in particular, they are equivalent to the revision operator being definable in terms of structures known as selection functions, epistemic entrenchments, systems of spheres, and preference relations. The latter are reflexive, transitive, and total relations over the set of models.

Each revision operator formula_25 satisfying the AGM postulates is associated to a set of preference relations formula_42, one for each possible belief set formula_23, such that the models of formula_23 are exactly the minimal of all models according to formula_42. The revision operator and its associated family of orderings are related by the fact that formula_29 is the set of formulae whose set of models contains all the minimal models of formula_24 according to formula_42. This condition is equivalent to the set of models of formula_29 being exactly the set of the minimal models of formula_24 according to the ordering formula_42.

A preference ordering formula_42 represents an order of implausibility among all situations, including those that are conceivable but yet currently considered false. The minimal models according to such an ordering are exactly the models of the knowledge base, which are the models that are currently considered the most likely. All other models are greater than these ones and are indeed considered less plausible. In general, formula_53 indicates that the situation represented by the model formula_54 is believed to be more plausible than the situation represented by formula_55. As a result, revising by a formula having formula_54 and formula_55 as models should select only formula_54 to be a model of the revised knowledge base, as this model represent the most likely scenario among those supported by formula_24.

==Contraction==
Contraction is the operation of removing a belief formula_24 from a knowledge base formula_23; the result of this operation is denoted by formula_62. The operators of revision and contractions are related by the Levi and Harper identities:

: formula_63
: formula_64

Eight postulates have been defined for contraction. Whenever a revision operator satisfies the eight postulates for revision, its corresponding contraction operator satisfies the eight postulates for contraction and vice versa. If a contraction operator satisfies at least the first six postulates for contraction, translating it into a revision operator and then back into a contraction operator using the two identities above leads to the original contraction operator. The same holds starting from a revision operator.

One of the postulates for contraction has been longly discussed: the recovery postulate:

: formula_65

According to this postulate, the removal of a belief formula_24 followed by the reintroduction of the same belief in the belief set should lead to the original belief set. There are some examples showing that such behavior is not always reasonable: in particular, the contraction by a general condition such as formula_19 leads to the removal of more specific conditions such as formula_9 from the belief set; it is then unclear why the reintroduction of formula_19 should also lead to the reintroduction of the more specific condition formula_9. For example, if George was previously believed to have German citizenship, he was also believed to be European. Contracting this latter belief amounts to ceasing to believe that George is European; therefore, that George has German citizenship is also retracted from the belief set. If George is later discovered to have Austrian citizenship, then the fact that he is European is also reintroduced. According to the recovery postulate, however, the belief that he also has German citizenship should also be reintroduced.

The correspondence between revision and contraction induced by the Levi and Harper identities is such that a contraction not satisfying the recovery postulate is translated into a revision satisfying all eight postulates, and that a revision satisfying all eight postulates is translated into a contraction satisfying all eight postulates, including recovery. As a result, if recovery is excluded from consideration, a number of contraction operators are translated into a single revision operator, which can be then translated back into exactly one contraction operator. This operator is the only one of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery; among this group, it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible.

==The Ramsey test==
The evaluation of a counterfactual conditional formula_71 can be done, according to the Ramsey test (named for Frank P. Ramsey), to the hypothetical addition of formula_9 to the set of current beliefs followed by a check for the truth of formula_10. If formula_23 is the set of beliefs currently held, the Ramsey test is formalized by the following correspondence:

: formula_75 if and only if formula_76

If the considered language of the formulae representing beliefs is propositional, the Ramsey test gives a consistent definition for counterfactual conditionals in terms of a belief revision operator. However, if the language of formulae representing beliefs itself includes the counterfactual conditional connective formula_77, the Ramsey test leads to the Gärdenfors triviality result: there is no non-trivial revision operator that satisfies both the AGM postulates for revision and the condition of the Ramsey test. This result holds in the assumption that counterfactual formulae like formula_78 can be present in belief sets and revising formulae. Several solutions to this problem have been proposed.

==Non-monotonic inference relation==
Given a fixed knowledge base formula_23 and a revision operator formula_25, one can define a non-monotonic inference relation using the following definition: formula_81 if and only if formula_82. In other words, a formula formula_24 entails another formula formula_84 if the addition of the first formula to the current knowledge base leads to the derivation of formula_84. This inference relation is non-monotonic.

The AGM postulates can be translated into a set of postulates for this inference relation. Each of these postulates is entailed by some previously considered set of postulates for non-monotonic inference relations. Vice versa, conditions that have been considered for non-monotonic inference relations can be translated into postulates for a revision operator. All these postulates are entailed by the AGM postulates.

==Foundational revision==
In the AGM framework, a belief set is represented by a deductively closed set of propositional formulae. While such sets are infinite, they can always be finitely representable. However, working with deductively closed sets of formulae leads to the implicit assumption that equivalent belief sets should be considered equal when revising. This is called the &quot;principle of irrelevance of syntax&quot;.

This principle has been and is currently debated: while formula_86 and formula_87 are two equivalent sets, revising by formula_8 should produce different results. In the first case, formula_9 and formula_10 are two separate beliefs; therefore, revising by formula_8 should not produce any effect on formula_10, and the result of revision is formula_93. In the second case, formula_94 is taken a single belief. The fact that formula_9 is false contradicts this belief, which should therefore be removed from the belief set. The result of revision is therefore formula_96 in this case.

The problem of using deductively closed knowledge bases is that no distinction is made between pieces of knowledge that are known by themselves and pieces of knowledge that are merely consequences of them. This distinction is instead done by the &quot;foundational&quot; approach to belief revision, which is related to foundationalism in philosophy. According to this approach, retracting a non-derived piece of knowledge should lead to retracting all its consequences that are not otherwise supported (by other non-derived pieces of knowledge). This approach can be realized by using knowledge bases that are not deductively closed and assuming that all formulae in the knowledge base represent self-standing beliefs, that is, they are not derived beliefs. In order to distinguish the foundational approach to belief revision to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases, the latter is called the &quot;coherentist&quot; approach. This name has been chosen because the coherentist approach aims at restoring the coherence
(consistency) among &quot;all&quot; beliefs, both self-standing and derived ones. This approach is related to coherentism in philosophy.

Foundationalist revision operators working on non-deductively closed belief sets typically select some subsets of formula_23 that are consistent with formula_24, combined them in some way, and then conjoined them with formula_24. The following are two non-deductively closed base revision operators.

; WIDTIO : (When in Doubt, Throw it Out) the maximal subsets of formula_23 that are consistent with formula_24 are intersected, and formula_24 is added to the resulting set; in other words, the result of revision is composed by formula_24 and of all formulae of formula_23 that are in all maximal subsets of formula_23 that are consistent with formula_24;

;Williams : solved an open problem by developing a new representation for finite bases that allowed for AGM revision and contraction operations to be performed. This representation was translated to a computational model and an anytime algorithm for belief revision was developed.

; Ginsberg–Fagin–Ullman–Vardi : the maximal subsets of formula_28 that are consistent and contain formula_24 are combined by disjunction;

; Nebel : similar to the above, but a priority among formulae can be given, so that formulae with higher priority are less likely to being retracted than formulae with lower priority.

A different realization of the foundational approach to belief revision is based on explicitly declaring the dependences among beliefs. In the truth maintenance systems, dependence links among beliefs can be specified. In other words, one can explicitly declare that a given fact is believed because of one or more other facts; such a dependency is called a &quot;justification&quot;. Beliefs not having any justifications play the role of non-derived beliefs in the non-deductively closed knowledge base approach.

==Model-based revision and update==
A number of proposals for revision and update based on the set of models of the involved formulae were developed independently of the AGM framework. The principle behind this approach is that a knowledge base is equivalent to a set of &quot;possible worlds&quot;, that is, to a set of scenarios that are considered possible according to that knowledge base. Revision can therefore be performed on the sets of possible worlds rather than on the corresponding knowledge bases.

The revision and update operators based on models are usually identified by the name of their authors: Winslett, Forbus, Satoh, Dalal, Hegner, and Weber. According to the first four of these proposal, the result of revising/updating a formula formula_23 by another formula formula_24 is characterized by the set of models of formula_24 that are the closest to the models of formula_23. Different notions of closeness can be defined, leading to the difference among these proposals.

; Peppas and Williams : provided the formal relationship between revision and update. They introduced the Winslett Identity in the Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic.

; Dalal : the models of formula_24 having a minimal Hamming distance to models of formula_23 are selected to be the models that result from the change;

; Satoh : similar to Dalal, but distance between two models is defined as the set of literals that are given different values by them; similarity between models is defined as set containment of these differences;

; Winslett : for each model of formula_23, the closest models of formula_24 are selected; comparison is done using set containment of the difference;

; Borgida : equal to Winslett&#x27;s if formula_23 and formula_24 are inconsistent; otherwise, the result of revision is formula_119;

; Forbus : similar to Winslett, but the Hamming distance is used.

The revision operator defined by Hegner makes formula_23 not to affect the value of the variables that are mentioned in formula_24. What results from this operation is a formula formula_122 that is consistent with formula_24, and can therefore be conjoined with it. The revision operator by Weber is similar, but the literals that are removed from formula_23 are not all literals of formula_24, but only the literals that are evaluated differently by a pair of closest models of formula_23 and formula_24 according to the Satoh measure of closeness.

==Iterated revision==
The AGM postulates are equivalent to a preference ordering (an ordering over models) to be associated to every knowledge base formula_23. However, they do not relate the orderings corresponding to two non-equivalent knowledge bases. In particular, the orderings associated to a knowledge base formula_23 and its revised version formula_29 can be completely different. This is a problem for performing a second revision, as the ordering associated with formula_29 is necessary to calculate formula_132.

Establishing a relation between the ordering associated with formula_23 and formula_29 has been however recognized not to be the right solution to this problem. Indeed, the preference relation should depend on the previous history of revisions, rather than on the resulting knowledge base only. More generally, a preference relation gives more information about the state of mind of an agent than a simple knowledge base. Indeed, two states of mind might represent the same piece of knowledge formula_23 while at the same time being different in the way a new piece of knowledge would be incorporated. For example, two people might have the same idea as to where to go on holiday, but they differ on how they would change this idea if they win a million-dollar lottery. Since the basic condition of the preference ordering is that their minimal models are exactly the models of their associated knowledge base, a knowledge base can be considered implicitly represented by a preference ordering (but not vice versa).

Given that a preference ordering allows deriving its associated knowledge base but also allows performing a single step of revision, studies on iterated revision have been concentrated on how a preference ordering should be changed in response of a revision. While single-step revision is about how a knowledge base formula_23 has to be changed into a new knowledge base formula_29, iterated revision is about how a preference ordering (representing both the current knowledge and how much situations believed to be false are considered possible) should be turned into a new preference relation when formula_24 is learned. A single step of iterated revision produces a new ordering that allows for further revisions.

Two kinds of preference ordering are usually considered: numerical and non-numerical. In the first case, the level of plausibility of a model is representing by a non-negative integer number; the lower the rank, the more plausible the situation corresponding to the model. Non-numerical preference orderings correspond to the preference relations used in the AGM framework: a possibly total ordering over models. The non-numerical preference relation were initially considered unsuitable for iterated revision because of the impossibility of reverting a revision by a number of other revisions, which is instead possible in the numerical case.

Darwiche and Pearl formulated the following postulates for iterated revision.

# if formula_139 then formula_140;
# if formula_141, then formula_140;
# if formula_143, then formula_144;
# if formula_145, then formula_146.

Specific iterated revision operators have been proposed by Spohn, Boutilier, Williams, Lehmann, and others. Williams also provided a general iterated revision operator.

; Spohn rejected revision : this non-numerical proposal has been first considered by Spohn, who rejected it based on the fact that revisions can change some orderings in such a way the original ordering cannot be restored with a sequence of other revisions; this operator change a preference ordering in view of new information formula_24 by making all models of formula_24 being preferred over all other models; the original preference ordering is maintained when comparing two models that are both models of formula_24 or both non-models of formula_24;

; Natural revision : while revising a preference ordering by a formula formula_24, all minimal models (according to the preference ordering) of formula_24 are made more preferred by all other ones; the original ordering of models is preserved when comparing two models that are not minimal models of formula_24; this operator changes the ordering among models minimally while preserving the property that the models of the knowledge base after revising by formula_24 are the minimal models of formula_24 according to the preference ordering;

; Transmutations : Williams provided the first generalization of belief revision iteration using transmutations. She illustrated transmutations using two forms of revision, conditionalization and adjustment, which work on numerical preference orderings; revision requires not only a formula but also a number or ranking of an existing belief indicating its degree of plausibility; while the preference ordering is still inverted (the lower a model, the most plausible it is) the degree of plausibility of a revising formula is direct (the higher the degree, the most believed the formula is);

; Ranked revision : a ranked model, which is an assignment of non-negative integers to models, has to be specified at the beginning; this rank is similar to a preference ordering, but is not changed by revision; what is changed by a sequence of revisions are a current set of models (representing the current knowledge base) and a number called the rank of the sequence; since this number can only monotonically non-decrease, some sequences of revision lead to situations in which every further revision is performed as a full meet revision.

==Merging==
The assumption implicit in the revision operator is that the new piece of information formula_24 is always to be considered more reliable than the old knowledge base formula_23. This is formalized by the second of the AGM postulates: formula_24 is always believed after revising formula_23 with formula_24. More generally, one can consider the process of merging several pieces of information (rather than just two) that might or might not have the same reliability. Revision becomes the particular instance of this process when a less reliable piece of information formula_23 is merged with a more reliable formula_24.

While the input to the revision process is a pair of formulae formula_23 and formula_24, the input to merging is a multiset of formulae formula_23, formula_166, etc. The use of multisets is necessary as two sources to the merging process might be identical.

When merging a number of knowledge bases with the same degree of plausibility, a distinction is made between arbitration and majority. This distinction depends on the assumption that is made about the information and how it has to be put together.

; Arbitration : the result of arbitrating two knowledge bases formula_23 and formula_166 entails formula_169; this condition formalizes the assumption of maintaining as much as the old information as possible, as it is equivalent to imposing that every formula entailed by both knowledge bases is also entailed by the result of their arbitration; in a possible world view, the &quot;real&quot; world is assumed one of the worlds considered possible according to at least one of the two knowledge bases;

; Majority : the result of merging a knowledge base formula_23 with other knowledge bases can be forced to entail formula_23 by adding a sufficient number of other knowledge bases equivalent to formula_23; this condition corresponds to a kind of vote-by-majority: a sufficiently large number of knowledge bases can always overcome the &quot;opinion&quot; of any other fixed set of knowledge bases.

The above is the original definition of arbitration. According to a newer definition, an arbitration operator is a merging operator that is insensitive to the number of equivalent knowledge bases to merge. This definition makes arbitration the exact opposite of majority.

Postulates for both arbitration and merging have been proposed. An example of an arbitration operator satisfying all postulates is the classical disjunction. An example of a majority operator satisfying all postulates is that selecting all models that have a minimal total Hamming distance to models of the knowledge bases to merge.

A merging operator can be expressed as a family of orderings over models, one for each possible multiset of knowledge bases to merge: the models of the result of merging a multiset of knowledge bases are the minimal models of the ordering associated to the multiset. A merging operator defined in this way satisfies the postulates for merging if and only if the family of orderings meets a given set of conditions. For the old definition of arbitration, the orderings are not on models but on pairs (or, in general, tuples) of models.

==Social choice theory==
Many revision proposals involve orderings over models representing the relative plausibility of the possible alternatives. The problem of merging amounts to combine a set of orderings into a single one expressing the combined plausibility of the alternatives. This is similar with what is done in social choice theory, which is the study of how the preferences of a group of agents can be combined in a rational way. Belief revision and social choice theory are similar in that they combine a set of orderings into one. They differ on how these orderings are interpreted: preferences in social choice theory; plausibility in belief revision. Another difference is that the alternatives are explicitly enumerated in social choice theory, while they are the propositional models over a given alphabet in belief revision.

==Complexity==
From the point of view of computational complexity, the most studied problem about belief revision is that of query answering in the propositional case. This is the problem of establishing whether a formula follows from the result of a revision, that is, formula_82, where formula_23, formula_24, and formula_84 are propositional formulae. More generally, query answering is the problem of telling whether a formula is entailed by the result of a belief revision, which could be update, merging, revision, iterated revision, etc. Another problem that has received some attention is that of model checking, that is, checking whether a model satisfies the result of a belief revision. A related question is whether such result can be represented in space polynomial in that of its arguments.

Since a deductively closed knowledge base is infinite, complexity studies on belief revision operators working on deductively closed knowledge bases are done in the assumption that such deductively closed knowledge base are given in the form of an equivalent finite knowledge base.

A distinction is made among belief revision operators and belief revision schemes. While the former are simple mathematical operators mapping a pair of formulae into another formula, the latter depend on further information such as a preference relation. For example, the Dalal revision is an operator because, once two formulae formula_23 and formula_24 are given, no other information is needed to compute formula_29. On the other hand, revision based on a preference relation is a revision scheme, because formula_23 and formula_24 do not allow determining the result of revision if the family of preference orderings between models is not given. The complexity for revision schemes is determined in the assumption that the extra information needed to compute revision is given in some compact form. For example, a preference relation can be represented by a sequence of formulae whose models are increasingly preferred. Explicitly storing the relation as a set of pairs of models is instead not a compact representation of preference because the space required is exponential in the number of propositional letters.

The complexity of query answering and model checking in the propositional case is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for most belief revision operators and schemas. Most revision operators suffer from the problem of representational blow up: the result of revising two formulae is not necessarily representable in space polynomial in that of the two original formulae. In other words, revision may exponentially increase the size of the knowledge base.

==Relevance==
New breakthrough results that demonstrate how relevance can be employed in belief revision have been achieved. Williams, Peppas, Foo and Chopra reported the results in the &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; journal.

Belief revision has also been used to demonstrate the acknowledgement of intrinsic social capital in closed networks.

==Implementations==
Systems specifically implementing belief revision are:

*SATEN – an object-oriented web-based revision and extraction engine (Williams, Sims)
*ADS – SAT solver–based belief revision (Benferhat, Kaci, Le Berre, Williams)
*BReLS
*Immortal

Two systems including a belief revision feature are SNePS and Cyc.

<text>Sir Alan Geoffrey Wilson (born 8 January 1939) is a British mathematician and social scientist, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds and a professor at University College London.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in Bradford on 8 January 1939, and educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Darlington and the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and studied the Mathematical Tripos, graduating in 1960.

==Career and research==
Wilson converted in the 1960s from theoretical physics to the social sciences through research on the mathematical modelling of cities (working in Oxford and London). From 1961 to 1964, he was a Scientific Officer in the Theoretical Physics Group at the Rutherford Laboratory; from 1964 to 1966, a Research Officer at the Institute of Economics and Statistics in the University of Oxford; from 1966 to 1968, Head of the Mathematical Advisory Group at the Ministry of Transport; and from 1968 to 1970, assistant director of the Centre for Environmental Studies in London. He was appointed Professor of Urban and Regional Geography at the University of Leeds in 1970, Pro-Vice-Chancellor in 1989 and was Vice Chancellor from 1991. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1994, and was knighted in 2001.

Sir Alan retired in May 2004 after 13 years as Vice-Chancellor. During his time the university underwent unprecedented growth and transformation. Student numbers increased from 12,000 to 31,500, turnover increased from £100m to £320m and research income increased by more than 400% to £71m.

His knowledge of the university sector led to his appointment as first Director General for Higher Education by the UK Government at the Department for Education and Skills, a post which he took up part-time in February 2004 and full-time on 1 June 2004 until 2007. In this role, he was a key adviser to secretaries of state Charles Clarke, Ruth Kelly and Alan Johnson, and played a critical role in the government&#x27;s drive to widen participation in higher education and maintaining a world-class education system.

In May 2006 he was appointed Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and took up the post in October. He resigned from the post of Master of Corpus Christi on 1 May 2007, after only seven months in post.

In September, 2007, he joined University College London to serve as Professor of Urban and Regional Systems at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis He was the Chairman of the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) from 2007 to 2013.
Since 2013, he has been Chair of the Home Office Science Advisory Council and Chair of the Lead Expert Group of the Government Office for Science Foresight project on the Future of Cities.

In 2016, he was appointed as Interim CEO of the Alan Turing Institute before becoming director of special projects when Adrian Smith took over. He retired as executive chair of the Ada Lovelace Institute in February 2020, having overseen the organisation&#x27;s development phase, and was succeeded by Dame Wendy Hall.

In 2022, he took on a new role at the London Interdisciplinary School (LIS) as the Director of Research and a Board Observer. In this role, as of 2024, he is responsible for applying his extensive experience and expertise in Interdisciplinary studies to support the institution&#x27;s interdisciplinary educational and research initiatives.

<text>[[Postage stamp|Stamp]] albums are books used to house a collection of postage stamps.

== Overview ==
Albums are a popular means of storing and displaying stamp collections for both beginners as well as accomplished collectors. They range from simple bound volumes intended to hold a fixed number of stamps to large multi-volumed collections with loose leafed pages to allow for expansion as the collection grows.
Preprinted albums which are commercially available are the mainstay of the stamp collecting hobby. However, many collectors prefer the flexibility of laying out their own album pages.

== Preprinted albums ==

Many collectors buy preprinted albums and pages, which are produced by several manufacturers. The gamut ranges from worldwide albums, with only enough spaces for the common stamps and a few more, to one-country albums with spaces for every type of stamp known. The usual format is to print a black-and-white picture of the stamp in each space, reduced in size so that a real stamp will cover it up, and add a thin frame around the stamp. Captions range from minimal mentions of perforation or watermark, up to a paragraph giving a little background on the stamp&#x27;s subject. Album pages are almost always one-sided; two-sided pages save space, but require interleaving sheets to prevent stamps from catching on each other. Pre-printed albums come in various formats where the collector can mount a used stamp with a hinge, create a pocket for the individual stamp using a pre-cut mount to stick to the page, or the easiest type called a &quot;hingeless album&quot; system where the pre-printed album page includes a place to put your postage stamp.

== Album layout ==

For ultimate flexibility, many collectors prefer to layout their own album pages. 
The arrangement of stamps on the page depends on the taste of the collector and the purpose of the collection. A collection with &quot;one of each&quot; stamp may have rows of stamps placed on each page, while a specialist&#x27;s page might have a dozen examples of similar stamps, differing in watermarks, colour shades, perforations etc.
Traditionally page creation has been done by hand using pen and ink; in recent years, however, with the advent of personal computers, home-printed pages have become popular. Ready to print album files may be found on the web, both free and commercial, or created by the collector using general-purpose software such as Microsoft Word or Scribus, or by means of a dedicated stamp album page layout program such as AlbumEasy.

== History ==

One of the first albums was the Stanley Gibbons “V.R.” published in the early 1870s. This was followed by the “Improved”, and then the illustrated “Imperial” albums. Present-day makers include Safe, Lighthouse (Leuchturm), Lindner, Palo, Scott, and White Ace. Once collectors have started using a particular brand, they have a strong incentive to stay with it, and the manufacturers offer annual updates for the stamps issued during the previous year.

In the earliest albums, stamps were adhered to the pages, using either their own gum (as if put on an envelope) or glue. Stamp hinges were introduced soon after, allowing stamps to be removed without major damage to either the stamp or the album page. In the second half of the 20th century, stamp mounts were introduced. Mounts typically hold the stamp between two layers of plastic, with the front layer transparent, and are attached to an album page, allowing the stamp to be displayed without an adhesive touching the stamp. When properly used, mounts allow the stamp to be removed from the album in the same condition in which it was inserted. An album in which the mounts are affixed at the factory, either as mounts for individual stamps or as larger strips, is called &quot;hingeless&quot;.



== Using albums ==
Better-quality albums have padded covers, which reduces possible pressure on the stamps exerted by adjacent albums on a shelf. Careful collectors do not cram albums tightly together, so as allow for a bit of air movement through the pages, and to prevent gum oozing or sticking.

<doc id="1187318" wikidata="Q1429217" url="?curid=1187318" title="Larry Hama">
<text>Larry Hama (; born June 7, 1949) is an American comic-book writer, artist, actor, and musician who has worked in the fields of entertainment and publishing since the 1960s.

During the 1970s, he was seen in minor roles on the TV shows &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and appeared on Broadway in two roles in the original 1976 production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;.

He is best known to American comic book readers as a writer and editor for Marvel Comics, where he wrote the licensed comic book series &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;, based on the Hasbro toyline. He has also written for the series &quot;Wolverine&quot;, &quot;Nth Man: The Ultimate Ninja&quot;, and &quot;Elektra&quot;. He co-created the character Bucky O&#x27;Hare, which was developed into a comic book, a toy line and television cartoon.

In October 2024, Hama was inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Hama was born June 7, 1949, in New York City. Growing up, Hama studied Kodokan Judo and later studied Kyūdō (Japanese archery) and Iaido (Japanese martial art swordsmanship). Planning to become a painter, Hama attended Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Art and Design, where one instructor was former EC Comics artist Bernard Krigstein. He was in the same graduating class as Frank Brunner and Ralph Reese.

==Career==

===Early career===
Hama sold his first comics work to the fantasy film magazine &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot; when he was 16 years old, and he followed by collaborating with Bhob Stewart on pages for the underground tabloid &quot;Gothic Blimp Works&quot;. After high school, Hama took a job drawing shoes for catalogs, and then served in the United States Army from 1969 to 1971, during the Vietnam War, where he became a firearms and explosive ordnance expert. Hama&#x27;s experiences in Vietnam informed his editing of the 1986-1993 Marvel Comics series &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot;. Upon his discharge, Hama became active in the Asian community in New York City.

High-school classmate Ralph Reese, who had become an assistant to famed EC and Marvel artist Wally Wood, helped Hama get a similar job at Wood&#x27;s Manhattan studio. Hama assisted on Wood&#x27;s comic strips &quot;Sally Forth&quot; and &quot;Cannon&quot;, which originally ran in &quot;Military News&quot; and &quot;Overseas Weekly&quot; and were later collected in a series of books. During this time, he also had illustrations published in such magazines as &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and Reese and he collaborated on art for a story in the underground comix-style humor magazine &quot;Drool&quot; #1 (1972). Through contacts made while working for Wood, Hama began working at comic-book and commercial artist Neal Adams&#x27; Continuity Associates studio; with other young contemporaries there, including Reese, Frank Brunner and Bernie Wrightson, Hama became part of the comic-book inking gang credited as the &quot;Crusty Bunkers.&quot; His first known work as such is on the Alan Weiss-penciled &quot;Slaves of the Mahars&quot; in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Weird Worlds&quot; #2 (Nov. 1972).

Hama began penciling for comics a year-and-a-half later, making an auspicious debut succeeding character co-creator Gil Kane on the feature &quot;Iron Fist&quot; in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;, taking over with the martial arts superhero&#x27;s second appearance and his next three stories (#16-19, July-Nov. 1974). He went on to freelance for start-up publisher Atlas/Seaboard (writing and penciling the first two issues of the sword &amp; sorcery series &quot;Wulf the Barbarian&quot;, writing the premiere of the science fiction/horror &quot;Planet of Vampires&quot;); some penciling work on the seminal independent comic book &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot; #1 (Sept. 1975); and two issues of the jungle-hero book &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; before beginning a long run at DC Comics.

At DC, Hama became an editor of the titles &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Mister Miracle&quot;, &quot;Super Friends&quot;, and &quot;The Warlord&quot;, and the TV-series licensed property &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; from 1977 to 1978. He then joined Marvel as an editor in 1980. 

===Acting===

Hama had a brief acting career in the mid-1970s, despite never having pursued the field. The casting director for the musical &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, Joanna Merlin, called Hama because an actor friend of his gave her his name when asked if he knew any other Asian actors. He told her that he had never acted before and could neither sing nor dance, but Merlin was persistent, and when informed that casting was less than a minute away from his workplace at Continuity Comics, he agreed to audition and was ultimately cast in three roles.

He also played a role in the 1976 &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;The Korean Surgeon&quot; and a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; spoof of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. However, though he had made a living as an actor for roughly a year, Hama ultimately discarded his acting career, explaining, &quot;I always basically saw myself as an artist, not as anything else.&quot;

===&quot;G.I. Joe&quot;===
Hama is best known as the writer of the Marvel Comics licensed series &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, based on the Hasbro line of military action figures. Hama said in a 2006 interview that he was given the job by then editor-in-chief Jim Shooter after every other writer at Marvel had turned it down. Hama at the time had recently pitched a &quot;Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Fury Force&quot;, about a special mission force. Hama used this concept as the back-story for &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;. He included military terms and strategies, Eastern philosophy, martial arts and historical references from his own background. The comic ran 155 issues (February 1982 – October 1994).

Hama also wrote the majority of the G.I. Joe action figures&#x27; file cards—short biographical sketches designed to be clipped from the G.I. Joe and Cobra cardboard packaging. In 2007 these filecards were reprinted in the retro packaging for the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero 25th Anniversary line.

Hama said in 1986 that &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; had an unexpected female following due to such strong female characters as Cover Girl, Lady Jaye, and Scarlett (whose personality was based upon his wife). &quot;Most of the girls that write in [with letters to the comic] say that the reason they like the comic is that the women characters are simply part of the team. They’re not treated as any different from the other team members. They don&#x27;t go around with their palms nailed to their foreheads. They’re competent, straightforward, and they go ahead and get the job done. They also participate emotionally. They have their likes and dislikes. They’re not ill-treated and they&#x27;re not running around being worrywarts.&quot;

Hasbro sculptors sometimes used real people&#x27;s likenesses when designing its action figures. In 1987, Hasbro released the Tunnel Rat action figure. The character is an explosive ordnance disposal specialist, whose likeness was based on Hama.

In 2006, Hama returned to his signature characters with the Devils Due Publishing miniseries &quot;G.I. Joe Declassified&quot;, which chronicled the recruitment of the squad&#x27;s first members by General Hawk. In 2007, the company added the spin-off series &quot;Storm Shadow&quot;, written by Hama and penciled by Mark A. Robinson, which ceased publication with issue 7.

In December 2007, Hasbro released 25th-anniversary comic-book figure two-packs that featured original stories by Hama. These new Hasbro-published issues were designed to take place between the panels of the Marvel series.

In September 2008, IDW announced a new line of G.I. Joe comics with one series, &quot;G.I. Joe Origins&quot;, to be primarily written by Hama. He wrote the first five issues, as the series was originally intended to be a miniseries, and returned to write four more issues (including #19, which was a Snake Eyes &quot;silent issue&quot;) over the course of the book&#x27;s 23-issue run. IDW later revived the Marvel Comics continuity with Hama taking the helm of a new ongoing series, picking up where the Marvel series left off with issue #155 1/2.

In June 2023, Skybound announced the continuation of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero at Image. This would continue on from the IDW run, starting with issue #301.

===Other work===

At Marvel in the early 1980s, Hama edited the humor magazine &quot;Crazy&quot; and the Conan titles, and from 1986 to 1993, he edited the acclaimed comic book &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot;, a gritty Marvel series about the Vietnam War.

He also was an editor on &quot;Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham&quot; from 1983–1987.

Hama wrote the 16-issue Marvel series &quot;Nth Man: The Ultimate Ninja&quot; (Aug. 1989 - Sept. 1990), concerning the adventures of John Doe, an American ninja and Special Forces commando in an alternate reality in which World War III is sparked after the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons stockpiles are all destroyed. Hama also edited a relaunch of Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white comics magazine &quot;Savage Tales&quot;, overseeing its change from sword-and-sorcery to men&#x27;s adventure. Other comics Hama has written include &quot;Wolverine&quot;, &quot;Before the Fantastic Four: Ben Grimm and Logan&quot;, &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot;, and the X-Men brand extension &quot;Generation X&quot; for Marvel; and Batman stories for DC Comics. He wrote filecards for Hasbro&#x27;s line of sci-fi/police action figures, &quot;C.O.P.S. &#x27;n&#x27; Crooks&quot;.

While working at Neal Adams&#x27; Continuity Associates, Hama co-developed a series he and comic book artist Michael Golden first created in 1978, &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare&quot;, the story of a green anthropomorphic rabbit and his mutant mammal sidekicks in an intergalactic war against space amphibians. Bucky O&#x27;Hare went on to become a comic, cartoon, video game, and toy line.

Hama is credited as a writing consultant on the 2004 independent animated film &quot;The Easter Egg Adventure&quot; and he also contributed scripts to the second season of the animated series &quot;Robotboy&quot;.

In 2006, Osprey Publishing announced that Hama had been commissioned to write for their &quot;Osprey Graphic History&quot; series of comic books about historical battles, including the titles &quot;The Bloodiest Day—Battle of Antietam&quot;, and &quot;Surprise Attack—Battle of Shiloh&quot; (both with artist Scott Moore) and &quot;Fight to the Death: Battle of Guadalcanal&quot; and &quot;Island of Terror—Battle of Iwo Jima&quot; (with artist Anthony Williams).

In February 2008, Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing published &quot;Spooks&quot;, a comic book about a U.S. government antiparanormal investigator/task force. Hama created the military characters and R.A. Salvatore the monster characters. He was also the writer of DDP&#x27;s &quot;Barack the Barbarian&quot; series, a Conan the Barbarian parody starring U. S. President Barack Obama.

On September 19, 2012, Hama released his three-part vampire novel entitled &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

On December 17, 2012, Hama portrayed himself in a Christmas-themed episode of the Adult Swim series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.
In 2014, Hama began working with award-winning filmmaker Mark Cheng on an original film project, called &quot;Ghost Source Zero&quot;. The film was distributed by Sony Pictures in 2018.

In August 2014, Red Giant Entertainment announced that Hama would be writing the company&#x27;s new &quot;Monster Isle&quot; monthly series debuting that November.

On October 11, 2024, the Harvey Awards announced that Hama was one of five comics creators to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame at the 36th annual Harvey Awards ceremony on October 18 at the New York Comic Con. The other four inductees were Arthur Adams, Akira Toriyama, Sergio Aragonés, and John Buscema. Hama reacted to the accolade by stating, &quot;I am deeply honored to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame. I first met Harvey Kurtzman in 1966, when as a student at the High School of Art and Design, I would visit the office of &quot;HELP!&quot; magazine. He and art director Terry Gilliam were extremely kind to this nerdy fanboy cartoonist wannabe, and opened flat-file drawers to show me original art by R. Crumb, Willy Elder, John Severin, Jack Davis, and many others. His open, welcoming nature made me feel that my goals were not as unreachable as I feared them to be.”

<text>William &quot;Bill&quot; Wall (born 6 July 1955) is an Irish novelist, poet and short story writer.

==Early life and education==
Wall was born in Cork city in 1955, but he was raised in the coastal village of Whitegate. He received his secondary education at the Christian Brothers School in Midleton. He progressed to University College Cork where he graduated in Philosophy and English.

==Career==
William Wall is the author of seven novels, five collections of poetry and three volumes of short stories. For many years he taught English at Presentation Brothers College, Cork, where he inspired Cillian Murphy to enter acting.

In 1997, Wall won the Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award. He published his first collection of poetry in that year. His first novel, &quot;Alice Falling&quot;, a dark study of power and abuse in modern-day Ireland, appeared in 2000.

In 2005, &quot;This Is The Country&quot; appeared. A broad attack on politics in &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; Ireland, as well as a rite of passage novel, it was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and shortlisted for the Irish Book Awards. It can be read as a satirical allegory on corruption, the link between capitalism and liberal democracy exemplified in the &#x27;entrepreneurial&#x27; activities of minor drug dealers and gangsters, and reflected in the architecture of business parks and sink estates. This political writing takes the form of &quot;an insightful and robust social conscience&quot;, in the words of academic John Kenny. Dr Kenny also focused on what he saw as Wall&#x27;s &quot;baneful take on the Irish family, his fundamentally anti-idyllic mood&quot; which has &quot;not entirely endeared Wall to the more misty-eyed among his readers at home or abroad&quot;. The political is also in evidence in his second collection of poetry &quot;Fahrenheit Says Nothing To Me&quot;. He is not a member of Aosdána, the Irish organisation for writers and artists. In 2006, his first collection of short fiction, &quot;No Paradiso&quot;, appeared. In 2017, he became the first European to win the Drue Heinz Literature Prize.

In 2022 he published his seventh novel. It appeared in Italian translation first as La Ballata Del Letto Vuoto, with the English original “Empty Bed Blues” published in 2023. He has described the Italian debut as &#x27;an experiment that so far has gone well&#x27;. His next novel was also published first in Italian in May 2024 as “Ti ricordi Mattie Lantry?”.

His provocative political blog, &quot;The Ice Moon&quot;, has increasingly featured harsh criticism of the Irish government over their handling of the economy, as well as reviews of mainly left-wing books and movies. He writes for literary journals such as Studi Irlandesi. His work has been translated into several languages.

He was one of the Irish delegates at the European Writers Conference in Istanbul in 2010.

==Critical response to his work==
Described by writer Kate Atkinson as &quot;lyrical and cruel and bold and with metaphors to die for&quot;, critics have focused on Wall&#x27;s mastery of language, his gift for &quot;linguistic compression&quot;, his &quot;poet&#x27;s gift for apposite, wry observation, dialogue and character&quot;, his &quot;unflinching frankness&quot; and his &quot;laser-like ... dissection of human frailties&quot;, which is counterbalanced by &quot;the depth of feeling that Wall invests in his work&quot;. A &quot;New Yorker&quot; review of his first novel declares &quot;Wall, who is also a poet, writes prose so charged—at once lyrical and syncopated—that it&#x27;s as if Cavafy had decided to write about a violent Irish household&quot;. In a recent review, his long poem &quot;Job in Heathrow&quot;, anthologised in &quot;The Forward Book of Poetry 2010&quot; but originally published in &quot;The SHOp&quot;, was described as &quot;a chilling airport dystopia&quot;. Poet Fred Johnston suggests that Wall&#x27;s poetry sets out to &quot;list the shelves of disillusion under which a thinking man can be buried&quot;. &quot;His apocalyptic vision of the ecological demise of our planet is suffused with humility and resignation where the global catastrophe is transformed &quot;into a universal truth / the days are shorter / today than yesterday&quot;, according to Borbála Faragó. For Philip Coleman &quot;Ghost Estate&quot; is a deeply political book, but it also articulates a profound interest in and engagement with questions of aesthetics and poetics&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wall is a longtime sufferer from Still&#x27;s disease and described his efforts to circumvent the disabling effects of the disease using speech-to-text applications as &quot;a battle between me and the software&quot;.

<text>The Bung language is a nearly extinct, endangered language of Cameroon spoken by three people (in 1995) at the village of Boung on the Adamawa Plateau. It is remembered best by one speaker who learned the language at a young age, though it is not his mother tongue. A wordlist shows its strongest resemblance to be with the Ndung dialect of Mambiloid language Kwanja, although that may simply be because this has become the dominant language of the village where Bung&#x27;s last speakers reside. It also has words in common with other Mambiloid languages such as Tep, Somyev and Vute, while a number of words&#x27; origins remain unclear (possibly Adamawan). For lack of data, it is not definitively classified.

<doc id="1187327" wikidata="Q917479" url="?curid=1187327" title="Small-waterplane-area twin hull">
<text>A small waterplane area twin hull, better known by the acronym SWATH, is a catamaran design that minimizes hull cross section area at the sea&#x27;s surface. Minimizing the ship&#x27;s volume near the surface area of the sea, where wave energy is located, minimizes a vessel&#x27;s response to sea state, even in high seas and at high speeds. The bulk of the displacement necessary to keep the ship afloat is located beneath the waves, where it is less affected by wave action. Wave excitation drops exponentially as depth increases, so wave action normally does not affect a submerged submarine at all. Placing the majority of a ship&#x27;s displacement under the waves is similar in concept to creating a ship that rides atop twin submarines.

== Effects ==

The twin-hull design provides a stable platform and large, broad decks. Compared with conventional catamarans, SWATH vessels have more surface drag, but less wave drag. They are less susceptible to wave motion but more sensitive to payload, which affects draught. Additionally, SWATH vessels cannot operate in planing or semi-planing modes and thus gain no drag reduction when operating at speeds normally associated with such modes. They require a complex control system, have a deeper draft, and have higher maintenance requirements. The design of SWATH vessels is also considerably more complex due to the structural complexities inherent to the design.

== History ==

The SWATH form was invented by Canadian Frederick G. Creed, who presented his idea in 1938, and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. The first full-scale SWATH vessel to be built and put into service was MV &quot;Duplus&quot;, a diving support vessel built in the Netherlands in 1968. In the 1970s, several units were built in different countries (including the by the US Navy, and an ferry in Japan). Since the 1980s, oceanographic research vessels, pilot tenders, yachts and other craft are more routinely being built with the SWATH hull type.

<doc id="1187337" wikidata="Q1541234" url="?curid=1187337" title="Pressure-gradient force">
<text>In fluid mechanics, the pressure-gradient force is the force that results when there is a difference in pressure across a surface. In general, a pressure is a force per unit area across a surface. A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force, which can result in an acceleration according to Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, if there is no additional force to balance it. The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher-pressure to the region of lower-pressure. When a fluid is in an equilibrium state (i.e. there are no net forces, and no acceleration), the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium. In the case of atmospheres, the pressure-gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. In Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, for example, air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth&#x27;s surface, thus providing a pressure-gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere.

== Magnus effect==
The Magnus effect is an observable phenomenon that is commonly associated with a spinning object moving through a fluid. The path of the spinning object is deflected in a manner that is not present when the object is not spinning. The deflection can be explained by the difference in pressure of the fluid on opposite sides of the spinning object. The Magnus effect is dependent on the speed of rotation.
== Formalism ==
Consider a cubic parcel of fluid with a density formula_1, a height formula_2, and a surface area formula_3. The mass of the parcel can be expressed as, formula_4. Using Newton&#x27;s second law, formula_5, we can then examine a pressure difference formula_6 (assumed to be only in the formula_7-direction) to find the resulting force, formula_8.

The acceleration resulting from the pressure gradient is then,
formula_9

The effects of the pressure gradient are usually expressed in this way, in terms of an acceleration, instead of in terms of a force. We can express the acceleration more precisely, for a general pressure formula_10 as,
formula_11

The direction of the resulting force (acceleration) is thus in the opposite direction of the most rapid increase of pressure.

<doc id="1187338" wikidata="Q731016" url="?curid=1187338" title="Stamp hinge">
<text>In philately, stamp hinges, or mounts, are small, folded, transparent, rectangular pieces of paper coated with a mild gum. They are used by stamp collectors to affix postage stamps onto the pages of a stamp album.

== Use ==
The short end is moistened and affixed to the stamp, the long end is likewise affixed to the page. The hinge keeps the stamp on the page while still allowing it to be lifted to examine the back, for instance to see the watermark or expert marks.

== Abbreviation ==
Collectors categorise their stamps as follows:
* MUH/MNH – Mint Unhinged/Never Hinged
* H – Hinged
* LH – Lightly Hinged
* HH – Heavily Hinged
* HR – Hinge Remnant (portion of the hinge could not be removed and remains on the stamp)

== Risks ==
The best stamp hinges are designed to be &quot;peelable&quot;, meaning that the stamp may be removed from the page, and the hinge from the stamp, without damage to either. Not all makes of hinge have this property, and the backs of many stamps have &quot;hinge remnants&quot;, where the hinge has torn away rather than releasing the stamp. This is especially common for mint stamps, where the stamp&#x27;s own gum adheres tightly to the hinge. Some old stamps may have multiple hinge remnants layered on top of each other. Conversely, careless removal of a hinge may take away a layer of the stamp&#x27;s paper, resulting in a type of &quot;stamp thin&quot; known as a &quot;hinge thin&quot;. The thinner paper will be noticeable when the stamp is held up to the light and is considered a serious fault in a stamp.

Even with the use of peelable hinges and care to minimize the moisture used, the hinge will leave a visible disturbance in the gum of an unused stamp. While this was formerly a matter of indifference, since about the middle of the 20th century many collectors have come to prefer &quot;unhinged stamps&quot; showing no trace of hinging.

Collectors preferring unhinged stamps typically use pocket-like or sleeve-like hingeless mounts, often for higher-value or unused stamps.

== Re-gumming ==

Since the time that unhinged stamps became popular, considerable numbers of old stamps with intact gum have appeared on the market, raising suspicion that many of these have been regummed.

<text>Valerian Aleksandrovich Zorin (; 14 January 1902 – 14 January 1986) was a Soviet diplomat best remembered for his famous confrontation with Adlai Stevenson on 25 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Life and career==
Zorin was born in Novocherkassk. After joining the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1922, Zorin held a managerial position in a Moscow city committee and the Central Committee of the Komsomol until 1932. In 1935, he graduated from the Communist Institute of Education (Высший коммунистический институт просвещения). From 1935 to 1941, Zorin worked on numerous Party assignments and as a teacher. From 1941 to 1944, he was employed at the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. From 1945 to 1947, Zorin was the Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia. In 1948, he helped to organise the Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état. From 1947 to 1955 and again from 1956 to 1965, he was Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. At the same time, he held other positions, including that of the permanent Soviet representative at the UN Security Council from 1952 to 1953. From 1955 to 1956, Zorin was the first Soviet ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany. From 1956 to 1965, he again represented the Soviet Union at the UN Security Council, which led to his famous confrontation with Adlai Stevenson on 25 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, Zorin released a controversial statement on the potential causes of the president&#x27;s murder that dismissed beliefs that Kennedy had been killed by a leftist fanatic, Lee Harvey Oswald, and instead speculated that it might have been a result of Kennedy&#x27;s progressive views concerning civil rights and the &quot;scum&quot; of the American South.

From 1965 to 1971, Zorin served as the Soviet ambassador to France. In 1971, he became an ambassador on special missions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. At the 22nd and 23rd Congress of the CPSU in 1961 and 1966, Zorin was elected to the Central Committee of the CPSU.
==In popular culture==
*In the 1974 television play &quot;The Missiles of October&quot;, Zorin is portrayed by Will Kuluva.
*In the 2000 film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, he is portrayed by Oleg Vidov.
*In the 2013 television series, &quot;Czech Century&quot; (&quot;České století&quot;), he is portrayed by the opera singer Vladimír Koval.

<text>Stanisław Żółkiewski (; 1547 – 7 October 1620) was a Polish nobleman of the Lubicz coat of arms, a magnate, military commander, and Chancellor of the Polish Crown in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth who took part in many military campaigns in the Commonwealth and on its southern and eastern borders. 

He held high posts in the administration of the Commonwealth, including those of Castellan of Lwów (from 1590), Governor of Kiev Province, and Great Chancellor of the Crown (from 1618). From 1588 he was also a Field Crown Hetman, and in 1618 was promoted to Grand Hetman of the Crown. He won major battles against Sweden, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and the Tatars. Żółkiewski&#x27;s best-known victory was against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the 1610 battle of Klushino, in whose wake the Poles seized and occupied Moscow. 

He died in the 1620 Battle of Cecora against the Ottomans, after allegedly refusing to retreat. The fame of the already renowned Żółkiewski was further boosted by his heroic death. He was one of the most accomplished military commanders of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==Life==
===Youth===

Stanisław Żółkiewski was born in the village of (then Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, now western Ukraine) in 1547 to of the Lubicz coat of arms, voivode of Ruthenia, and Zofia Lipska. The exact date of his birth is unknown, and even the year is disputed: most sources agree on 1547, although a few suggest 1550.

Żółkiewski attended a cathedral school in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine). Unlike many of his peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies on his own and was particularly interested in history and historical literature. In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus, as an aid to the king&#x27;s secretary Jan Zamoyski. There he became familiar with the executionist movement, which advocated numerous reforms including military ones. In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France, sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France, and on his way back he was sent to Vienna to appease the Habsburgs.

===Early career===
Żółkiewski gained his first military experience under King Stefan Batory during the Danzig rebellion in which he commanded a rota of Polish hussars. He subsequently participated in Batory&#x27;s Livonian campaign, fighting at Polotsk, Rossony (Sokół), Velizh and at the Siege of Pskov. Żółkiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family after those campaigns ended, particularly in their conflict with the Zborowscy. On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured Samuel Zborowski, whose subsequent execution caused much controversy. Żółkiewski became notorious for his role in the incident, and was the subject of heated debates during the Sejm of 1585.

In 1588, during the War of the Polish Succession between factions of Sigismund III Vasa and Maximilian III, Żółkiewski supported Sigismund. Żółkiewski commanded the right flank of Commonwealth forces in the battle of Byczyna, during which he received a knee wound that lamed him for the remainder of his life. For his part in the battle he was appointed a Field Crown Hetman, and became the starost of Hrubieszów.

===Field Crown Hetman===
Soon after becoming a Hetman, Żółkiewski was sent to Ukraine to repel a Tatar invasion. In 1590 he became the castellan of Lwów, but his requests for military reinforcements against the Tatars went unheeded.

In 1595 Żółkiewski participated in the Moldavian campaign and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river. The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko. Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, which led to a deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo.

In 1601 Żółkiewski operated in the north, in Livonia (Inflanty), during the Polish–Swedish War. He also took part in the successful siege of Wolmar, and in 1602 the taking of Fellin. That same year he led Polish forces at the battle of Reval, which led to a Swedish capitulation at the siege of Biały Kamień. Żólkiewski became ill near the end of the campaign and had to relinquish command of his forces to Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz.

In 1606 Żółkiewski returned to Ukraine, where he defeated the Tatars at the battle of Udycz. Later that year he decided to support the king during the Zebrzydowski rebellion. His decision was not an obvious one, as his mentor Zamoyski opposed the king. Additionally, Żółkiewski was related to the Zebrzydowski family and was sympathetic to some of the rebels&#x27; arguments. In the battle of Guzów he commanded the left flank of the royal forces, but his troops took relatively little part in the battle. Unimpressed with Żółkiewski&#x27;s performance, the king did not give him the Grand Crown Hetmanship that he coveted, although he was appointed to the office of the voivode of Kiev.

In the second half of 1609, Żółkiewski took part in the Polish–Russian War (also known as the &quot;Dymitriads&quot;). He supported the election of Władysław IV Vasa for the title of tsar of Russia and the idea of a personal union between the Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia (the Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth). During the De la Gardie Campaign in 1610 he achieved another significant victory against combined Russian and Swedish forces at the battle of Klushino. As a result of his successful campaign Żółkiewski seized Moscow and captured the tsar Vasiliy Shuisky and his brothers, Ivan Shuisky and Dmitry Shuisky. Sigismund rejected Żółkiewski&#x27;s political plan however, which would have required Władysław to convert to Orthodoxy.

Żółkiewski began to write his memoirs after his return from Russia. The &quot;Początek i progres wojny moskiewskiej&quot; (&quot;The beginning and Progress of the Muscovite War&quot;), published in 1612, is a critique of Sigismund&#x27;s policies. In 1612, he became a teacher and tutor of Stanisław Koniecpolski, future hetman and military commander. Also that year he returned to Ukraine to defend against continuing Tatar and Moldovan incursions, as well as Cossack unrest. In 1616 during a Sejm he presented a project &quot;O chowaniu żołnierza kwarcianego&quot; (&quot;On the raising of the kwarciane soldiers&quot;), in which he argued for the need to raise a larger army to deal with the Tatars and the Cossacks. The project was however not approved by the parliament.

===Final years===

Żółkiewski&#x27;s popularity waned in the latter years of his career. He was accused of not supporting Samuel Korecki during the battle of Sasowy Róg in 1616, of signing the Treaty of Jaruga (Busza) in 1617 which relinquished influence in some borderlands to Moldova and the Ottoman Empire; and of failing to stop the Tatars at the battle of Orynin in 1618. But in 1618 he finally received his coveted buława of the Grand Crown Hetman, and shortly afterwards the office of Grand Crown Chancellor. He was thus for a brief period the most powerful individual in the Commonwealth after the king, a position he reached not through wealth or family but by military achievement and reputation.

Despite being more than 70 years old, Żółkiewski continued in active service as a military commander until the very end. He died on 7 October 1620, during the Commonwealth&#x27;s retreat after the battle of Cecora against the Turks, during the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–1621) which marked the end of the Moldavian campaigns. The battle comprised several engagements, in which Polish forces were routed. During the last rout Żólkiewski was killed; according to an anecdote he refused to retreat, preferring to stay with the rear guard till the very end. Before his death he received the blessing of his confessor, Father Szymon Wybierski (Wybierek) of the Society of Jesus, who stood fearlessly at his side (7 October). {see painting &quot;Battle of Cecora (1620)&quot; by Walery Eljasz Radzikowski}

After the battle Żółkiewski&#x27;s corpse was desecrated by the removal of its head and sent to Constantinople as a trophy of war. His widow bought his body from the Turks and ransomed their son, who had been captured during the battle. Żółkiewski was buried in St Lawrence Church in Żółkiew (now Zhovkva, Ukraine), the town he enlarged and where he built the Żółkiew Castle.

==Remembrance==
Żółkiewski&#x27;s heroic death – portrayed in several works of art by contemporaries such as and Stanisław Witkowski – boosted his reputation and guaranteed him a place among the pantheon of the most famous of Polish military commanders. In the years following his death he was mentioned in the works of writers such as Stefan Żeromski, Józef Szujski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Maria Konopnicka. Up to the present day, the story of his death is the best remembered aspect of his life, with a number of sources discussing the &quot;legend of Żółkiewski&quot;.

A monument was built at the site of Żółkiewski&#x27;s death (now in Berezovca in Ocnița District, Moldova) by his son Jan, in 1621. It is inscribed with a motto from Horace: &quot;Quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; (How sweet and fitting it is to die for one&#x27;s country). The monument was destroyed in 1868, rebuilt in 1912, and renovated in 2003. It is a venue for events organized by the Polish minority in Moldova.

In 1903 a statue of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was demolished in 1939 by Soviet troops in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Poland. In modern Poland Źółkiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia&#x27;s Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison. As of 2011, the St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainian conservators.

==Family and assets==

Żółkiewski was married to Regina Herbutówna; they had a son, , and two daughters, Katarzyna and Zofia. Over the course of his career Żółkiewski amassed a large fortune, and acquired lands near Boryspil, Brody, Vinnytsia and Żółkiew. His annual income of more than 100,000 zlotys made him one of the wealthiest magnates in the Commonwealth. Żółkiewski&#x27;s assets were eventually inherited by Jakub Sobieski, whose son Jan became a Polish king and another renowned Polish commander.

<text>Västra Hoby Church (&quot;Västra Hoby kyrka&quot;) is a church in Lund Municipality, Sweden. The church is in the parish of Torns of the Diocese of Lund. 

==History==
Most of the church was built in 1886 after most of the previous church had been demolished. The tower from the 15th century was preserved.

On a wall in the back of the church room there is a reredos from the 15th century. It was stored at the Kulturen museum of cultural history in Lund, but has now been moved back to Västra Hoby Church.
The reredos is divided into 19 fields. The first nine fields show the childhood of Jesus. The tenth field is much larger than the others and shows the crucifixion of Jesus. The last nine fields show the Story of the Passion.

The baptismal font is made of sandstone and was made in the Middle Ages. 
The altarpiece is a copy of a Carl Bloch-painting made in 1886 by Hjalmar Berggren.
In 2002 the present church organ was moved from Odarslöv Church which was deconsecrated in 2004. Odarslöv Church was consecrated on November 14. It has 528 pipes and was made by Eskil Lundin in 1904. 
Before the vintage organ was installed, the church had a modern organ made in 1966 by Mårtenssons orgelfabrik.

<text>Neuropathic pain is pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Neuropathic pain may be associated with abnormal sensations called dysesthesia or pain from normally non-painful stimuli (allodynia). It may have continuous and/or episodic (paroxysmal) components. The latter resemble stabbings or electric shocks. Common qualities include burning or coldness, &quot;pins and needles&quot; sensations, numbness and itching.

Up to 7–8% of the European population is affected by neuropathic pain, and in 5% of persons it may be severe. The pain may result from disorders of the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Neuropathic pain may occur in isolation or in combination with other forms of pain. Medical treatments focus on identifying the underlying cause and relieving pain. In cases of peripheral neuropathy, the pain may progress to insensitivity.
== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of pain conditions relies on the character of the pain with a sharp stabbing character and the presence of particular features such as mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia. Neuropathic pain also tends to affect defined dermatomes and there may be limits to the area of pain. For neuropathic pain, clinicians look for an underlying lesion to the nervous system or an inciting cause consistent with the development of neuropathic pain. The obvious presence of an underlying feature or cause is not always detectable, and response to treatment may be used as a surrogate particularly in cases where diagnosis of the underlying lesion leaves the patient in pain for a prolonged period of time. MRI may be helpful in the identification of underlying lesions, reversible causes or serious underlying conditions such as primary presentation of a tumor or multiple sclerosis. Quantitative sensory testing (QST), a system of detailed analysis of the somatosensory system, is frequently used in research situations to identify neuropathic pain and a more detailed analysis of its components. It has been suggested by some authorities that QST may have a future role in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain and in particular the identification of neuropathic pain subtypes. Neuropathic pain can occur alone or in combination with other types of pain. The identification of neuropathic pain components is important as different classes of analgesic are required.

The gold standard for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy as the etiology of neuropathic pain is skin biopsy. Sudomotor assessment, through electrochemical skin conductance, an accurate objective technique, could be considered as a good screening tool to limit skin biopsy in patients in whom it is not suitable.

== Causes ==
Neuropathic pain may be divided into peripheral, central or mixed (peripheral and central) types. Central neuropathic pain is found in spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Peripheral neuropathies are commonly caused by diabetes, metabolic disorders, herpes zoster infection, HIV-related neuropathies, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, immune mediated disorders and physical trauma to a nerve trunk. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer as a direct result of cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), or as a side effect of chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), radiation injury or surgery.

== Comorbidities ==
Neuropathic pain has profound physiological effects on the brain which can manifest as psychological disorders. Rodent models where the social effects of chronic pain can be isolated from other factors suggest that induction of chronic pain can cause anxio-depressive symptoms and that particular circuits in the brain have a direct connection. Depression and neuropathic pain may have a bidirectional relationship and relief of co-morbid depression may underlie some of the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants in neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain has important effects on social well-being that should not be ignored. People with neuropathic pain may have difficulty working exhibiting higher levels of presenteeism, absenteeism and unemployment, exhibit higher levels of substance misuse (which may be related to attempted self-medication), and present difficulties with social interactions. Moreover, uncontrolled neuropathic pain is a significant risk factor for suicide. Certain classes of neuropathic pain may cause serious adverse effects necessitating hospital admission, for instance trigeminal neuralgia can present as a severe crisis where the patient may have difficulty talking, eating and drinking. As neuropathic pain may be comorbid with cancer, it can have important dose limiting effects on certain classes of chemotherapeutic.

== Treatments ==
Neuropathic pain can be very difficult to treat with only some 40-60% of people achieving partial relief.

=== General approach ===
First line treatments are certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), and anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin). Opioid analgesics are recognized as useful agents but are not recommended as first line treatments. A broader range of treatments are used in specialist care. There are limited data and guidance for the long-term treatment of pain. Notably, strong evidence from randomized controlled trials is not available for all interventions.

=== Primary interventions ===

==== Anticonvulsants ====
Pregabalin and gabapentin may reduce pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. The anticonvulsants carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are especially effective in trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is a voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor, and reduces neuronal excitability by preventing depolarisation. Carbamazepine is most commonly prescribed to treat trigeminal neuralgia due to clinical experience and early clinical trials showing strong efficacy. Gabapentin may reduce symptoms associated with neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia in some people. There is no predictor test to determine if it will be effective for a particular person. A short trial period of gabapentin therapy is recommended, to determine the effectiveness for that person. 62% of people taking gabapentin may have at least one adverse event, however the incidence of serious adverse events was found to be low.

Meta analysis of randomized clinical trials suggests that Lamotrigine is not useful for the majority of patients although it may have use in treatment of refractory cases.

==== Antidepressants ====
Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in particular duloxetine, as well as tricyclic antidepressants in particular amitriptyline, and nortriptyline are considered first-line medications for this condition.

==== Opioids ====
Opioids, while commonly used in chronic neuropathic pain, are not a recommended first or second line treatment. In the short and long term they are of unclear benefit, although clinical experience suggests that opioids like tramadol may be useful for treating sudden onset severe pain In the intermediate term evidence of low quality supports utility.

Several opioids, particularly levorphanol, methadone and ketobemidone, possess NMDA receptor antagonism in addition to their μ-opioid agonist properties. Methadone does so because it is a racemic mixture; only the l-isomer is a potent μ-opioid agonist. The d-isomer does not have opioid agonist action and acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist; d-methadone is analgesic in experimental models of chronic pain.

There is little evidence to indicate that one strong opioid is more effective than another. Expert opinion leans toward the use of methadone for neuropathic pain, in part because of its NMDA antagonism. It is reasonable to base the choice of opioid on other factors. It is unclear if fentanyl gives pain relief to people with neuropathic pain. The potential pain relief benefits of strong opioids must be weighed against their significant addiction potential under normal clinical use and some authorities suggest that they should be reserved for cancer pain. Importantly, recent observational studies suggest a pain-relief benefit in non-cancer related chronic pain of reducing or terminating long-term opioid therapy.

=== Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions ===
Non-pharmaceutical treatments such as exercise, physical therapy and psychotherapy may be useful adjuncts to treatment.

=== Secondary and research interventions ===

==== Botulinum toxin type A ====
Local intradermal injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A may be helpful in chronic focal painful neuropathies. However, it causes muscle paralysis which may impact quality of life.

==== Cannabinoids ====
Evidence for the use of Cannabis based medicines is limited. Any potential utility might be offset by adverse effects.

==== Neuromodulators ====
Neuromodulation is a field of science, medicine and bioengineering that encompasses both implantable and non-implantable technologies (electrical and chemical) for treatment purposes.

Implanted devices are expensive and carry the risk of complications. Available studies have focused on conditions having a different prevalence than neuropathic pain patients in general. More research is needed to define the range of conditions that they might benefit.

====Deep brain stimulation====
The best long-term results with deep brain stimulation have been reported with targets in the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter (79%), or the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter plus thalamus and/or internal capsule (87%). There is a significant complication rate, which increases over time.

====Motor cortex stimulations====
Stimulation of the primary motor cortex through electrodes placed within the skull but outside the thick meningeal membrane (dura) has been used to treat pain. The level of stimulation is below that for motor stimulation. As compared with spinal stimulation, which is associated with noticeable tingling (paresthesia) at treatment levels, the only palpable effect is pain relief.

====Spinal cord stimulators====
Spinal cord stimulators use electrodes placed adjacent to but outside the spinal cord. The overall complication rate is one-third, most commonly due to lead migration or breakage but advancements in the past decade have driven complication rates much lower. Lack of pain relief occasionally prompts device removal.

==== NMDA antagonism ====
The &quot;N&quot;-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor seems to play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and dextromethorphan can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance. Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very short half life (ketamine), weak activity (memantine) or unacceptable side effects (dextromethorpan).

==== Intrathecal drug delivery ====
Intrathecal pumps deliver medication to the fluid filled (subarachnoid) space surrounding the spinal cord. Opioids alone or opioids with adjunctive medication (either a local anesthetic or clonidine). Rarely there are complications such as serious infection (meningitis), urinary retention, hormonal disturbance and intrathecal granuloma formation have been noted with intrathecal infusion, associated with the delivery method.

==== Photopharmacology ====
Photoswitchable analogues of the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine have been developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light, with the purpose to reduce adverse systemic effects. One of these compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination in a rat model of neuropathic pain.

==== Conotoxins ====
Ziconotide is a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker which may be used in severe cases of ongoing neuropathic pain it is delivered intrathecally.

==== Ambroxol ====
Ambroxol is a drug that reduces mucus. Preclinical research suggests it may produce analgesic effects by blocking sodium channels in sensory neurons.

==== Gene therapy ====
The use of gene therapy is a potential treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. In animals a gene therapy for local transgenes encoding for GABA synthesizing-releasing inhibitory machinery has been demonstrated and was effective for months at a time. It increases synaptically GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition in the spinal cord (or in the brain) via the induced expression of genes GAD65 and VGAT without any detected systemic or segmental side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.ymthe.2022.04.023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Topical agents ====
In some forms of neuropathy the topical application of local anesthetics such as lidocaine may provide relief. A transdermal patch containing lidocaine is available commercially in some countries.

Repeated topical applications of capsaicin are followed by a prolonged period of reduced skin sensibility referred to as desensitization, or nociceptor inactivation. Capsaicin causes reversible degeneration of epidermal nerve fibers. Notably the capsaicin used for the relief of neuropathic pain is a substantially higher concentration than capsaicin creams available over the counter, there is no evidence that over the counter capsaicin cream can improve neuropathic pain and topical capsaicin can itself induce pain.

=== Surgical interventions ===
Orthopaedic interventions are frequently used to correct underlying pathology which may contribute to neuropathic pain. Many orthopaedic procedures have more limited evidence. Historically, neurosurgeons have attempted lesions of regions of the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. Whilst they cause some short term analgesia, these are considered to be universally ineffective.

If neuropathic pain is caused by nerve compression, this may be treatable with a nerve decompression. When nerves are subject to chronic pressure, they exhibit a pathological progression resulting in reversible and partially reversible nerve injuries that cause pain, paresthesias, and potentially muscle weakness. In a nerve decompression, a surgeon explores the entrapment site and removes tissue around the nerve to relieve pressure. In many cases the potential for nerve recovery (full or partial) after decompression is excellent, as chronic nerve compression is associated with low-grade nerve injury (Sunderland classification I-III) rather than high-grade nerve injury (Sunderland classification IV-V). Nerve decompressions are associated with a significant reduction in pain, in some cases the complete elimination of pain.

For patients with diabetic peripehral neuropathy (which affects 30% of diabetes patients) and superimposed nerve compression, this may be treatable with multiple nerve decompressions. The theory behind this procedure is that diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) predisposes peripheral nerves to compression at anatomic sites of narrowing, and that the majority of peripheral DPN symptoms may actually be attributable to nerve compression rather than DPN itself. The surgery is associated with lower pain scores, higher two-point discrimination (a measure of sensory improvement), lower rate of ulcerations, fewer falls (in the case of lower extremity decompression), and fewer amputations.

=== Alternative therapies ===

==== Herbal products ====
There is no good evidence that herbal products (nutmeg or St John&#x27;s wort) are useful for treating neuropathic pain.

==== Dietary supplements ====
A 2007 review of studies found that injected (parenteral) administration of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) was found to reduce the various symptoms of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. While some studies on orally administered ALA had suggested a reduction in both the positive symptoms of diabetic neuropathy (dysesthesia including stabbing and burning pain) as well as neuropathic deficits (paresthesia), the meta-analysis showed &quot;more conflicting data whether it improves sensory symptoms or just neuropathic deficits alone&quot;. There is some limited evidence that ALA is also helpful in some other non-diabetic neuropathies.

Benfotiamine is an oral prodrug of Vitamin B1 that has several placebo-controlled double-blind trials proving efficacy in treating neuropathy and various other diabetic comorbidities.

== History ==
The history of pain management can be traced back to ancient times. Galen also suggested nerve tissue as the transferring route of pain to the brain through the invisible psychic pneuma. The idea of origination of pain from the nerve itself, without any exciting pathology in other organs is presented by medieval medical scholars such as Rhazes, Haly Abbas and Avicenna. They named this type of pain specifically as &quot;vaja al asab&quot; [nerve originated pain], described its numbness, tingling and needling quality, discussed its etiology and the differentiating characteristics.
The description of neuralgia was made by John Fothergill (1712-1780). In a medical article entitled &quot;Clinical Lecture on Lead Neuropathy&quot; published in 1924 the word &quot;Neuropathy&quot; was used for the first time by Gordon.

== Proposed mechanistic basis for neuropathic pain ==
The underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain remains a contested topic. The etiology and mechanism of pain are related to the cause of the pain. Certain forms of neuropathic pain are associated with lesions to the central nervous system such as thalamic pain associated with certain lesions (for instance strokes) to the thalamus whereas other forms of pain have a peripheral inciting injury such as traumatic neuropathies. The inciting cause of neuropathy has important consequences for its mechanistic basis as different tissues and cells are involved. The mechanistic basis of neuropathic pain remains controversial as do the relative contributions of each pathway. Notably our understanding of these processes is largely driven by rodent models in part because studying these tissues in living adults is difficult.

=== Peripheral ===
With peripheral nervous system lesions, a number of processes may occur. Intact neurons may become unusually sensitive and develop spontaneous pathological activity and abnormal excitability.

During neuropathic pain, ectopic activity arises in the peripheral nociceptors and this appears to be due in part to changes in the ion channel expression at the level of the periphery. There may be an increase in the expression or activity of voltage gated sodium and calcium channels which will support action potential generation. There may also be a decrease in potassium channels which would normally oppose action potential generation. Each of these changes appears to support an increase in excitability, which may allow endogenous stimuli to cause spontaneous pain.

=== Central ===
Central mechanisms of neuropathic pain involve a number of major pathways. Nociception is ordinarily transduced by a polysynaptic pathway through the spinal cord, and up the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and then the cortex. Broadly speaking in neuropathic pain, neurons are hypersensitized, glia become activated and there is a loss of inhibitory tone.

==== Pain gates ====

A major hypothesis in the theory of pain perception is the gate control theory of pain, proposed by Wall and Melzack in 1965. The theory predicts that the activation of central pain inhibitory neurons by non-pain sensing neurons prevents the transmission of non-harmful stimuli to pain centers in the brain. A loss of inhibitory neurons, GAD65/67 expression (the enzymes that synthesise GABA; the predominant inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain), has been observed in some systems following peripheral neuropathy such as in rats, and mice. However, these observations remain controversial with some investigators unable to detect a change. The loss of inhibitory inputs may allow fibers to transmit messages via the spinothalamic tract thus causing pain in normally painless stimuli. This loss of inhibition may not be limited to the spinal cord and a loss of GABA has also been observed in chronic pain patients in the thalamus.

==== Glia ====

During neuropathic pain, glia become &quot;activated&quot; leading to the release of proteins that modulate neural activity. The activation of glia remains an area of intense interest for researchers. Microglia, the brain and spinal cord resident immune cells, respond to extrinsic cues. The source of these cues may include neurons secreting chemokines such as CCL21 and surface immobilized chemokines such as CX3CL1. Other glia such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes may also release these extrinsic cues for microglia and microglia themselves may produce proteins that amplify the response. The effect of microglia on neurons that leads to the neurons being sensitized is controversial. Brain derived neurotrophic factor, prostaglandins, TNF and IL-1β may be produced by microglia and cause changes in neurons that lead to hyperexcitability.

==== Central sensitization ====
Central sensitization is a potential component of neuropathic pain. It refers to a change in synaptic plasticity, efficacy, and intrinsic disinhibition that leads to an uncoupling of noxious inputs. In the sensitized neuron, outputs are no longer coupled to the intensity or duration and many inputs may be combined.

==== Circuit Potentiation ====
During high frequency stimulation synapses conveying nociceptive information may become hyper efficient in a process that is similar although not identical to long-term potentiation. Molecules such as substance P may be involved in potentiation via neurokinin receptors. NMDA activation also triggers a change in the post synapse, it activates receptor kinases that increase receptor trafficking and post-translationally modify receptors causing changes in their excitability.

==== Cellular ====
The phenomena described above are dependent on changes at the cellular and molecular levels. Altered expression of ion channels, changes in neurotransmitters and their receptors, as well as altered gene expression in response to neural input, are at play. Neuropathic pain is associated with changes in sodium and calcium channel subunit expression resulting in functional changes.  In chronic nerve injury, there is redistribution and alteration of subunit compositions of sodium and calcium channels resulting in spontaneous firing at ectopic sites along the sensory pathway.

<text>Les Rencontres Trans Musicales (generally referred to as &quot;Les Transmusicales de Rennes&quot;) is a music festival that lasts for 3 or 4 days. It is held annually in December. The festival takes place in Rennes, Brittany, France.
Since the festival&#x27;s beginning, it has been renowned for revealing the &quot;next big thing&quot; in music.
The festival has become one of the most significant musical events in Europe, attracting over 62,000 people in 2013. It attracted over 80 groups and artists from over 26 nationalities and music industry professionals coming from all continents.

== History ==

Les Rencontres Trans Musicales, often called &quot;Les Trans&quot;, was created in 1979 by , , Hervé Bordier (until 1996), Jean-René Courtès (until 1989), and other music students. The association was initially in debt, which led to programming a benefit concert. The first concert took place in la salle de la Cité in June. Twelve bands performed on two nights to an audience of approximately 1800 people. The second concert was in December 2013. 
Jean-Louis Brossard is the artistic director and Sandrine Poutrel is the production manager. Jean-Louis Brossard and Béatrice Macé together lead Les Rencontres Trans Musicales. From the first concerts, before the word &#x27;festival&#x27; had been attached to the event, the artistic bias of the line up was toward originality and new artistic forms. The artists who participated in the festival would often rise to the top of the music charts within a few months following their performance. Björk, Ben Harper and Lenny Kravitz all performed for the first time in public in the festival. It is considered that the festival boosted the popularity of Étienne Daho, Arno, Stephan Eicher, Les Négresses Vertes, Nirvana, Bérurier Noir, Denez Prigent, Daft Punk, Amadou &amp; Mariam, Birdy Nam Nam, Justice, Fugees, Stromae, London Grammar and many other bands.

In 2004, the festival moved to the Parc Expo, close to Rennes Bretagne Airport. Some concerts are still organized in the town of Rennes. In 2004, the festival moved to the Parc Expo
Since 1979, TRANS has shown the ability to capture the musical zeitgeist and to maintain with it a combination of discovery and influence.
TRANS exported itself to China, Norway, Czech Republic and Russia. On 8 December 2010, l&#x27;Association des Trans Musicales launched a website that recounts the history of the festival.

The Trans Musicales made it clear from the first edition, in June 1979, and their philosophy never changed:
* Reflect the reality of musical life
* Showcase emerging artists
* Find and promote artistic originality
* Help fulfill all the necessary conditions for experimentation

== The International Trans project ==

The international work has been going on since the end of the 1980s.
Turned towards research and exploration of musical movements and where they originate, the programming puts us in touch with artists, labels, editors and agents on all continents. On the other hand, the Trans collaboration with foreign media and professionals is strong and continuous.
Since the 2001 edition, the International Trans project consolidates and extends their work overseas, in partnership with Cultures France, a governmental operator on all international actions.
The project was conceived as a way to extend the collaboration with the artists beyond the time span of a single edition. The line-up included bands that have performed or are about to perform the Trans in Rennes; they are joined by local artists.

=== Previous actions ===

==== Expo 2002 ====
The Trans Musicales team programmed two evenings at the Cargo, in Neuchâtel, for the Expo.

==== Trans/Ubu/Bato Fou ====
In March 2003 two evenings and two residencies opposing Dj Morpheus vs. El Diabolo (Réunion) and Dj Buddha vs. Tamm Ha Tamm (Réunion).

==== Norway 2005 ====
During the festival, By-Larm, one evening in honour of Rennes and one improvised concert at the top of a glacier.

==== Beijing ====
18 and 19 June 2005 at Chaoyang Park. A huge stage, 16 artists in front of 16 000 spectators for the first open air festival in the Chinese capital.

==== Russia ====
In 2010, concerts took place in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Hip-Hop, jazz and electronic music were the main events.

== Trans on Tour ==
Co-produced by the association Trans Musicales, Trans on Tour offers for the ninth year in a row, the opportunity for local bands to perform in the venues of the Great West.
Kick-starting the festival, the main aim of this tour is to assist artists in developing their professionalism. The high point of this tour is a performance at the Trans Musicales for each participating band. The aim is to challenge aspiring artists with a stream of events requiring total immersion in a professional framework.
Being on tour means many concert dates, in this case ending with a performance at a festival visited by professionals: this project is a life-size rehearsal for the life of a professional performer.
Trans on Tour, conceived first as a boost to the local artistic scene, offers a wide range of tools to the bands: interviews at the beginning and the end of the tour, working time on the stage of the Ubu (local stage in Rennes), a regular follow-up by a specialised team, a promotional video and a dedicated stand at the festival&#x27;s Village.
During this tour with its twenty bands - out of which eight are on an accompaniment program – each concert concludes with the performance of an artist recommended by the host venue.

<text>The Battle of Cecora (also known as the &quot;Battle of Țuțora&quot;) took place during the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21) between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (aided by rebel Moldavian troops) and Ottoman forces (backed by Nogais), fought from 17 September to 7 October 1620 in Moldavia, near the Prut River.

== Prelude ==
Because of the failure of the Commonwealth diplomatic mission to Constantinople, and violations of the Treaty of Busza by both sides (as Cossacks and Tatars continued their raids across the borders), relations between the Ottomans and the Commonwealth rapidly deteriorated in early 1620. Both sides began preparing for war, as neither was quite ready for it at the time. The Ottomans declared war against Poland in 1620 and planned to attack in the spring of 1621. The Commonwealth Sejm denied most funds the hetmans had asked for. The Senate&#x27;s secret council finally decided, convinced by the Habsburgs&#x27; representative, to contribute the Commonwealth forces in 1620—even though many members of the Sejm thought that Polish–Lithuanian forces were neither sufficient nor fully prepared. Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, who was by then over 70 years old (as Commonwealth policy didn&#x27;t allow for a possibility of forced retirement from government offices such as that of hetman), foresaw the coming confrontation with the Ottoman Empire and decided to meet Ottoman troops on foreign soil, Moldavia being the obvious choice. However, the sultan sent Iskender Pasha to Moldavia to remove Hospodar Gaspar Graziani, who had allied himself with Poland.

Hetmans Zółkiewski and Koniecpolski led the army to Țuțora (&quot;Cecora&quot; in Polish sources), a commune in Iași County, Romania, to fight the Horde of Khan Temir (Kantymir). The army numbered between 5,000 to 9,000 (2,000 infantry but only about 1600 Cossack cavalry), with many regiments being made up of the private forces of magnates Koreckis, Zasławskis, Kazanowskis, Kalinowskis, and Potockis. The army entered Moldavia in September. The Moldavian ruler, hospodar Gaspar Graziani, nominally a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, decided to rebel and support the Commonwealth against the Ottomans. Graziani killed the janissaries in Iași, imprisoned envoys of Sultan Osman II (who had ordered his removal from power and his transport to Istanbul) and then prepared to flee, but was forced by Żółkiewski to attach his troops to the Polish–Lithuanian camp. However, many of the Moldavian boyars left the camp in order to defend their own estates against pillaging by undisciplined Commonwealth magnates&#x27; troops, others decided to wait and see what the outcome appeared to be so they could join the winning side, and others joined the Turks. Consequently, only about 600–1000 rebel Moldavian troops appeared in the Commonwealth camp. Żółkiewski ordered the army to proceed to the fortified camp (standing from previous wars) at Cecora.

== Battle ==
On 10 September, near Țuțora (close to Iași, Romania), the Commonwealth army encountered the Tatar and Ottoman forces, 13,000–22,000 strong, under the command of Iskender Pasha, the beylerbey of Ochakiv (Ozi). The Ottoman sultan&#x27;s force included Gabriel Bethlen&#x27;s Transylvanian army. The Tatar forces surprised the Commonwealth defenders, taking many prisoners. On the 18th, during the first day of fighting, most of the rebel Moldavians decided to switch sides and quickly attacked the Polish–Lithuanian flank. Mercenaries, private troops and their magnate leaders were lacking in discipline and morale. Stanisław Koniecpolski commanded the right flank of the Commonwealth forces during the ensuing battle. On 19 September it had become clear that the Polish–Lithuanian forces were defeated, although they still managed to hold their positions; on 20/21 September, Koniecpolski prevented the army from disintegrating. On 29 September, Commonwealth troops had broken through Ottoman ranks with tabor wagon trains and started their retreat. However, after Graziani bribed some magnates, units of private troops begun to flee and some mercenary cavalry panicked and also ran. This was a prelude of things to come. Consecutive attacks during the retreat (including a particularly violent one on 3 October) were repelled, but troop units started disintegrating as soon as soldiers caught sight of the Dniester and the Polish–Lithuanian border.

During another heavy assault on 6 October, most of the magnates and nobles broke and fled north, leaving infantry and camp, thus sealing the fate of the whole expedition: most of the Polish–Lithuanian troops were killed or captured. The ensuing battle saw the death of Żólkiewski Koniecpolski, and many others including Samuel Korecki, Mikolaj Struś, Mikołaj Potocki, Jan Żółkiewski, Łukasz Żołkiewski, while Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki and Bohdan Khmelnytsky were taken captive. Before his death, Żółkiewski received the blessing of his confessor, Father Szymon Wybierski (Wybierek) of the Society of Jesus, who stood by his side (7 October). Żółkiewski&#x27;s head was mounted on a pike and sent to the sultan; Duke Korecki, having often meddled in Moldavian territories, was executed in prison in Constantinople.

In the face of such an important victory, advised by grand vizier Ali Pasha and Gabriel Bethlen, Osman II decided that he could reinforce his rule or even extend it. Alexandru Iliaș was appointed as the ruler of Moldavia, the rebel Graziani having been killed during his flight on 29 September.

==Aftermath==
Between 1,000 and 1,500 Commonwealth men survived the battles, while the Tatars moved into Podolia, Wołyń and eastern Lesser Poland.

In 1621 an army of 200,000–250,000 Ottoman veterans, led by Osman II, advanced from Edirne towards the Polish frontier. The Ottomans, following their victory in the Battle of Cecora, had high hopes of conquering the southern part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Polish commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz crossed the Dniester in September with approximately 35,000 Polish troops and Cossack supporters and entrenched himself at the Chocim (Khotyn) Fortress, blocking the path of the slow Ottoman march. During the Battle of Khotyn, for more than a month (2 September – 9 October 1621), the Commonwealth hetman held the sultan at bay until the first autumn snow. The lateness of the season and the loss of approximately 40,000 men in battle compelled Osman II to initiate negotiations. A few days before the siege was to be lifted, on 24 September, the aged grand hetman died of exhaustion in the fortress. The battle was a stalemate and the resulting Treaty of Khotyn reflected it, providing some concessions to the Commonwealth but meeting some Ottoman demands.

Osman II blamed the stalemate of war on the lack of zeal and the &quot;degeneracy&quot; of the Janissaries. His efforts at modernizing the Ottoman army were not well received by the Janissaries and the conservative &quot;learned&quot; class. A revolt led by Janissaries and the students of the madrases erupted on 18 May 1622 and Osman II was deposed, and two days later he was killed by the rebels.

==Commemoration==
The Battle of Cecora is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;CECORA 18 – 29 IX 1620&quot;.

<text>The francisca (or francesca) was a throwing axe used as a weapon during the Early Middle Ages by the Franks, among whom it was a characteristic national weapon at the time of the Merovingians (about 500 to 750 AD). It is known to have been used during the reign of Charlemagne (768–814).
Although generally associated with the Franks, it was also used by other Germanic peoples of the period, including the Anglo-Saxons; several examples have been found in England.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;francisca&quot; first appeared in the book &quot;Etymologiarum sive originum, libri XVIII&quot; by Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636) as a name used in Hispania to refer to these weapons &quot;because of their use by the Franks&quot;.

The historian Gregory of Tours (c. 538–594) in his &quot;History of the Franks&quot; uses two Latin terms for the Frankish axe: &quot;securis&quot; and &quot;bipennis&quot;.

The régime of Vichy France used the image of a stylised double-headed &quot;francisque&quot; as part of its iconography (compare fasces).

==Description==
The francisca is characterized by its distinctly arch-shaped head, widening toward the cutting edge and terminating in a prominent point at both the upper and lower corners. The top of the head is usually either S-shaped or with the lower portion curving inward and forming an elbow with the short wooden haft. Sometimes the head is more upswept, forming a wider angle with the haft. Most franciscas have a round or teardrop-shaped eye designed to fit the tapered haft, similar to Viking axes. Based on the measurements of modern replicas, the francisca had a haft length of around and a cutting edge with an average weight of around . Based on the surviving heads of franciscas recovered at Burgh Castle and Morning Thorpe in county Norfolk, England, the length of the head itself measured from the edge to the back of the socket.

==Use==

The Byzantine historian Procopius (c. 500–565) described the Franks and their use of throwing axes:

Procopius makes it clear that the Franks threw their axes immediately before hand-to-hand combat with the purpose of breaking shields and disrupting the enemy line while possibly wounding or killing an enemy warrior. The weight of the head and length of the haft would allow the axe to be thrown with considerable momentum to an effective range of about . Even if the edge of the blade were not to strike the target, the weight of the iron head could cause injury. The francisca also had a psychological effect in that, on the throwing of the francisca, the enemy might turn and run in the fear that another volley was coming.

Some sources, strangely, describe the francisca as both the &quot;main weapons&quot; of the Frankish infantry around the time of Clovis and also describe the francisca as being a fierce melee weapon.

<doc id="1187375" wikidata="Q3322729" url="?curid=1187375" title="Islam in Sudan">
<text>Islam is the most common religion in Sudan and Muslims have dominated national government institutions since independence in 1956. According to UNDP Sudan, the Muslim population is 97%, including numerous Arab and non-Arab groups. The remaining 3% ascribe to either Christianity or traditional animist religions. Muslims predominate in all but Nuba Mountains region. The vast majority of Muslims in Sudan adhere to Sunni Islam of Maliki school of jurisprudence, deeply influenced with Sufism. There are also some Shia communities in Khartoum, the capital. The most significant divisions occur along the lines of the Sufi brotherhoods. Two popular brotherhoods, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist Parties respectively. Only the Darfur region is traditionally lacking the presence of Sufi brotherhoods found in the rest of the country.

Shari&#x27;a law has been installed by various military regimes, and its application to non-Muslims in the capital was a contentious issue during the negotiations, but it and the other major issues underlying the north–south conflict have been largely resolved in the agreements. Shari&#x27;a is to continue to be the basis of the national legal system as it applies in the north; national legislation applicable to the south is to be based on &quot;popular consensus, the values, and the customs of the people.&quot; In states or regions where a majority hold different religious or customary beliefs than those on which the legal system is based, the national laws may be amended to accord better with such beliefs. Throughout the country, the application of Shari&#x27;a to non-Muslims is to be limited, and courts may not exercise their discretion to impose the harsher physical forms of Shari&#x27;a penalties on non-Muslims. Sudan has had three democratic governments since 1956, all of which abolished Shari&#x27;a law.

In September 2020, Sudan constitutionally became a secular state after Sudan&#x27;s transitional government agreed to separate religion from the state, ending 30 years of Islamic rule and Islam as the official state religion in the North African nation. This new legislation also ended the former apostasy law and public flogging. However, after 1 year of military coup took place, Sharia got installed once again and harsh punishment like floggings still exist according to article 146.

==History==

There had been cultural contact between Nubians and Arabs long before the rise of Islam. Islam spread to Sudan from the north, after the Islamic conquest of Egypt under the government of Amr ibn al-Aas. Nubia had already been Christianized, also from Egypt, hence the old Nubian church followed Coptic Christianity. The Nubian Christian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia fell to the Islamic invasions in 650, 1312 and 1504, respectively. From 1504, northern Sudan was ruled by the Muslim Funj Sultanate.

Southern Sudan, i.e. South Kordofan and what is now South Sudan was neither Christianized nor Islamized until the 19th century. This region fell under Islamic rule under Muhammad Ali, and there has been religious and ethnic conflict ever since; the Mahdiyah uprisings (1881–1899) can even be seen as the origin of political Islamism and resulted in British control during 1899–1955. Racial and religious conflicts between the Arab Muslim north and the Black African Christian South re-erupted in the First Sudanese Civil War (1955–1972), the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005), the War in Darfur (2003–2010) and the ongoing conflict since 2011.

<doc id="1187382" wikidata="Q17432840" url="?curid=1187382" title="Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters">
<text>Edith Jessie Thompson (25 December 1893 – 9 January 1923) and Frederick Edward Francis Bywaters (27 June 1902 – 9 January 1923) were a British couple executed for the murder of Thompson&#x27;s husband Percy. Their case became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;.

==Early life==
Edith Thompson was born Edith Jessie Graydon on 25 December 1893, at 97 Norfolk Road in Dalston, London, the first of the five children of William Eustace Graydon (1867–1941), a clerk with the Imperial Tobacco Company, and his wife Ethel Jessie Graydon (née Liles) (1872–1938), the daughter of a police constable. During her childhood, Edith was a happy, talented girl who excelled at dancing and acting, and was academically bright, with a natural ability in arithmetic. After leaving school in 1909 she joined a firm of clothing manufacturers, Louis London, near Aldgate station in London. Then, in 1911, she was employed at Carlton &amp; Prior, wholesale milliners, in the Barbican and later in Aldersgate. Edith quickly established a reputation as a stylish and intelligent woman and was promoted by the company several times, until she became their chief buyer and made regular trips to Paris on behalf of the company.

In 1909, at the age of 15, Edith met Percy Thompson who was three years her senior. After a six-year engagement, they were married at St Barnabas, Manor Park on 15 January 1916. At first, the couple lived in Retreat Road in Westcliff-on-Sea, before buying a house at 41 Kensington Gardens in the then-fashionable London suburb of Ilford in July 1920. With both their careers flourishing, they lived a comfortable life.

==Acquaintance with Bywaters==

In 1920, the couple became acquainted with 18-year-old Frederick Bywaters, although Bywaters and Edith Thompson had met nine years earlier when Bywaters, then aged nine, had been a schoolfriend of Edith&#x27;s younger brothers.

Frederick Bywaters had enlisted in the merchant navy. The 26-year-old Edith was immediately attracted to Bywaters, who was handsome and impulsive and whose stories of his travels around the world excited Edith&#x27;s love of romantic adventure. To Edith, the youthful Bywaters represented her romantic ideal; by comparison, 29-year-old Percy seemed staid and conventional. Percy – oblivious to the emerging romantic attraction between his wife and Bywaters – welcomed the youth into their company. Shortly thereafter, the trio – joined by Edith&#x27;s sister Avis – holidayed in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight. Upon their return, Percy invited Bywaters to lodge with them.
===Affair===
While holidaying upon the Isle of Wight in June 1921, Edith and Bywaters began an affair. Initially, Percy was unaware of this although he gradually noticed his wife was drifting away from him. Matters came to a head barely a month after the affair started. A trivial incident in the Thompsons&#x27; garden triggered a violent row during which Percy Thompson struck his wife and caused her to fall over some furniture. Bywaters intervened and Thompson ordered him out of the house. The Thompsons&#x27; sitting tenant, a Mrs Lester, commented on Mrs Thompson&#x27;s bruises in one of her statements to police. From September 1921 until September 1922, Bywaters was at sea and during this time Edith Thompson wrote to him frequently. After his return, they met up again.

==Murder==
On 3 October 1922, the Thompsons attended a performance at the Criterion Theatre in Piccadilly Circus, London, together with Edith&#x27;s uncle and aunt, Mr and Mrs J. Laxton. They left the theatre at 11 pm and all went to Piccadilly Circus tube station, where they separated. The Thompsons caught the 11:30 pm train to Ilford. As they walked along Belgrave Road, between De Vere and Endsleigh Gardens, a man jumped out from behind some bushes near their home and attacked Percy. After a violent struggle, during which Edith Thompson was knocked to the ground, Percy was stabbed. Mortally wounded, he died before Edith could summon help. The attacker fled. Neighbours later reported hearing a woman (here assumed to have been Edith) screaming hysterically and shouting &quot;Oh don’t, oh don’t&quot; several times. By the time police arrived Edith had not composed herself. At the police station the following day she was distressed. She was unaware that Bywaters was already a suspect: he was arrested that evening and taken to Ilford Police Station. The police confronted her with Bywaters. One of the inspectors, Frank Hall, untruthfully told her that Bywaters had already confessed. She then admitted to the police that she knew who the assailant was and provided the police with details of her association with Bywaters.

The police investigated further and discovered a series of more than 60 love letters from Edith Thompson to Bywaters. The letters were the only tangible evidence linking Edith Thompson to the killer. In Stratford, London Magistrates Court her defence argued that the letters did not connect Mrs Thompson to the place or manner of the murder. Accordingly they did not allow for consideration of common purpose, namely that if two people agree to achieve the death of a third, and one of these people acts on the expressed intentions of both, both are equally guilty. The presiding magistrate decided that the letters should be admitted and that the court at the Old Bailey would rule on it again. Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters were each committed for trial, charged with murder.

==Trial==
The trial began on 6 December 1922 at the Old Bailey, before Mr Justice Shearman, with Bywaters defended by Cecil Whiteley KC, and Thompson by Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett KC. The prosecution for the Crown was led by the Solicitor-General Sir Thomas Inskip, assisted by Travers Humphreys. Bywaters had cooperated completely. He had led police to the murder weapon he concealed after the murder, and consistently maintained that he had acted without Edith&#x27;s knowledge.

Edith Thompson&#x27;s love letters were produced as evidence of incitement to murder. The extant letters date from November 1921 to the end of September 1922. They run to over 55,000 words and afford a day-to-day account of her life in London when her lover Bywaters was at sea. In a few passages of these letters, she writes about her longing to be free of her husband, Percy. She refers to grinding glass light bulbs to shards and feeding them to Percy mixed into mashed potato, and on another occasion feeding him poison. She wrote of a woman who had lost three husbands and remarked, “I can’t even lose one.” Thompson described how she had carried out her own abortion after becoming pregnant by Bywaters.

Edith Thompson&#x27;s counsel urged her not to testify, stressing that the burden of proof lay with the prosecution and that there was nothing they could prove other than that she had been present at the murder, but she rejected his advice. She was determined to give evidence, imagining that she could save Bywaters. As Curtis-Bennett later observed, she had no conception of the danger she was in. She made a poor impression on the judge and the jury, particularly when she repeatedly contradicted herself. She had claimed that she had never attempted to poison her husband and references in her letters to attempting to kill him were merely attempts to impress her paramour. In answer to several questions relating to the meaning of some of the passages in her letters, she simply said &quot;I have no idea.&quot;

Bywaters stated that Edith Thompson had known nothing of his plans, nor could she have, as he had not intended to murder her husband. His aim had been to confront Percy, he claimed, and to force him to deal with the situation. When Percy threatened to shoot him and reacted in a superior manner, Bywaters lost his temper. Edith Thompson, he repeatedly claimed, had made no suggestion to him to kill Percy, nor did she know that Bywaters intended to confront him. In discussing the letters, Bywaters stated that he had never believed Edith had attempted to harm her husband, but that he did believe she had a vivid imagination, which was fuelled by the novels she enjoyed reading. He felt that in her letters she viewed herself in some way as one of the fictional characters she had read about.

===Conviction===
On 11 December the jury returned a verdict of guilty against both defendants. Both Thompson and Bywaters were sentenced to death by hanging. Edith Thompson became hysterical and started screaming in the court while Bywaters loudly protested Edith Thompson&#x27;s innocence, stating: &quot;I say the verdict of the jury is wrong. Edith Thompson is not guilty.&quot;

==Imprisonment==
Before and during the trial, Thompson and Bywaters were the subjects of highly sensationalist and critical media commentary, but after they were sentenced to death there was a dramatic shift in public attitudes and in media coverage. Nearly a million people signed a petition against the death sentences. Bywaters in particular attracted admiration for his fierce loyalty and protectiveness towards Edith Thompson but she was widely regarded as the controlling mind that had set it all up. It was generally considered abhorrent to hang a woman (no woman had been executed in Britain since the baby farmer Rhoda Willis in 1907). Despite the petition and a new confession from Bywaters (in which he once again declared Thompson to be completely innocent), Home Secretary, William Bridgeman refused a reprieve. A few days before their executions, Edith Thompson was told that the date of execution had been fixed, at which point she lost her composure. She spent the last few days of her life in a state of near-hysteria, crying, screaming, moaning and unable to eat.

===Execution===
On 9 January 1923 in Holloway Prison, the 29-year-old Edith Thompson collapsed in terror at the prospect of her hanging. Heavily sedated by the prison governor, almost unconscious, she was carried to the gallows by four prison warders. In Pentonville Prison, the 20-year-old Frederick Bywaters, who had tried since his arrest to save Thompson from imprisonment and execution, was himself hanged.

The ordeal of executing Edith Thompson had a profound effect on her hangman John Ellis.

The two executions occurred simultaneously at 9:00 am, only about apart. Holloway and Pentonville prisons (respectively for women and men) are very close together in North London. Later, as was the rule, the bodies of Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters were initially buried within the walls of the prisons in which they had been executed.

==Burial==

The body of Edith Thompson was initially buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of Holloway Prison, as was customary. In 1971, the prison underwent an extensive programme of rebuilding, during which the bodies of all the executed women were exhumed for reburial outside the confines of the prison.
With the exception of Ruth Ellis, the remains of the women executed at Holloway (Edith Thompson, Styllou Christofi, Amelia Sach and Annie Walters) were reburied in a single grave at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.

The new grave (in plot 117) remained unmarked for over 20 years. It was acquired in the 1980s by René Weis and Audrey Russell, who had interviewed Avis Graydon (Edith Thompson&#x27;s surviving sister) at length in the 1970s. On 13 November 1993, a grey granite memorial was placed on plot 117, and dedicated to the memory of the four women buried there. The grave and plot were formally consecrated by the Reverend Barry Arscott of St. Barnabas, Manor Park, the church in which Edith Thompson was married in January 1916. Edith Thompson&#x27;s details appear prominently on the face of the tombstone, together with the epitaph: &quot;Sleep on beloved. Her death was a legal formality&quot;. The names of the other three women are inscribed around the edges of the tombstone. The precise location of Thompson&#x27;s former grave within Brookwood Cemetery is .

The remains of Frederick Bywaters still lie in an unmarked grave within the walls of HMP Pentonville, where they were buried shortly after his execution in January 1923.

The remains of Percy Thompson are buried at the City of London Cemetery and Crematorium.

On 22 November 2018, Edith Thompson&#x27;s remains were exhumed from Brookwood Cemetery, and two days later formally buried alongside her parents, in accordance with her mother&#x27;s wishes, in the City of London Cemetery.

==Critiques of the case and the trial==

René Weis echoes a trend of recent and older suggestions that Edith Thompson was innocent of murder. In his letter to the Home Secretary in 1988, he notes that the Crown used a selection of her letters in Court to generate a climate of prejudice against her as an immoral adulteress who seduced a young man eight years her junior. Weis writes: &quot;Despite the fact that there is no evidence of any kind in the letters or otherwise that Edith Thompson knew that her husband would be assaulted that night in that particular place and in that manner, the Solicitor-General stated in his opening address to the jury that ‘there is the undoubted evidence in the letters upon which you can find that there was a preconcerted meeting between Mrs Thompson and Bywaters at the place.’ As only half of Edith Thompson&#x27;s correspondence was submitted in Court, the jury may well have been led to believe, by this erroneous claim, that a reference to the place, the time, and the manner occurred in one of the letters withheld from them. That the jury was furthermore influenced by the judge&#x27;s openly expressed disgust concerning the sexual immorality of the correspondence is on record in a letter which a juror wrote to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; thirty years later: ‘It was my duty to read them [the letters] to the members of the jury … “Nauseous” is hardly strong enough to describe their contents ... The jury performed a painful duty, but Mrs Thompson&#x27;s letters were her own condemnation.&quot;

It is true that Mr Justice Shearman did instruct the jury to find Edith Thompson guilty only if they were convinced that she had lured her husband to the place where he was murdered. In his charge to the jury, he noted: &quot;Now, I am going to ask you to consider only one question in your deliberations, and that is, was it an arranged thing between the woman and the man? … if you think that when she saw him [Bywaters] there that evening he came there under her direction and information that she had given him as to where she would be about that time – if you think she knew perfectly well as soon as she set eyes on him that he was there to murder, she is guilty of murder too.&quot; The judge then turned to Edith Thompson’s letters, focusing on the ones referring to poison and ground glass, directing the jury to ‘look at these words’ when Edith related to Bywaters how she had pretended to Avis that Percy&#x27;s state of health worried her. Avis had testified in court that this incident was a fabrication regarding a bottle of medicinal tincture of opium which she, Avis, had poured down the sink. The judge saw it differently and restated the prosecution&#x27;s case: &quot;It is said that she is already preparing for witnesses in case there should be a murder case; that is what is said.&quot; He failed to acknowledge that this point had been tackled head-on by the defence, as it was his duty to do. Again, commenting on a passage in the letters in which Edith Thompson refers to &quot;this thing that I am going to do for both of us, will it ever at all make any difference between us, darlint [sic], do you understand what I mean; will you ever think any the less of me?&quot;, the judge simply restates the Crown&#x27;s interpretation, after pretending to the jury that he will resist interpreting the passage: &quot;The meaning of that is for you to judge; you will fully understand that it is not for me to tell you what the letters mean … It is said the meaning of that is ‘If I poison him is it going to make any difference to you afterwards’; that is what is suggested as the plain meaning of the words.&quot; The Court of Appeal would interpret the passage similarly as self-evident proof of intent to murder, overlooking the fact that this was not a charge that was being tried. The judge discredited Edith Thompson&#x27;s account of the murder. She swooned (according to her, the judge notes) and she lied to shield the killer. Above all the witnesses who claimed to have heard her scream of &quot;Oh don’t, oh don’t!&quot; may not be reliable. In his closing comments, Mr Justice Shearman impugned the integrity of the important witness John Webber, whose house was close to the scene of the murder. Webber&#x27;s is, according to the judge, a &quot;very curious piece of evidence&quot;. If Webber can be trusted to tell the truth, then there is corroborative proof of Edith Thompson&#x27;s spontaneous panic and hysteria during the fight and stabbings. The judge directs the jury: &quot;You know he [Webber] is some way off; I am not saying it is true; it is for you to say whether it is accurate, or whether it is imaginary, or whether he has made a mistake.&quot; Such direct undermining of a bona fide witness chimed with the judge&#x27;s evident hostility towards Edith Thompson. His wider anti-feminist bias at the trial was evident and extensively commented on at the time. Thus he consistently referred to the jury as &quot;gentlemen&quot; in spite of the fact that the jury included a woman juror.

Shearman labelled Edith an &quot;adulterer&quot; and therefore deceitful and wicked and, by implication, easily capable of murder. Her letters were full of &quot;insensate silly affection&quot;. He similarly repeatedly called Bywaters an &quot;adulterer&quot;. However, Filson Young, in writing contemporaneously with the trial in &quot;Notable British Trials&quot; (1923), suggests that it was the young of that generation who needed to learn morality:
&quot;Mr Justice Shearman frequently referred to Bywaters as &#x27;the adulterer&#x27;, apparently quite unconscious of the fact that, to people of Bywaters&#x27; generation, educated in the ethics of dear labour and cheap pleasure, of commercial sport and the dancing hall, adultery is merely a quaint ecclesiastical term for what seems to them the great romantic adventure of their lives. Adultery to such people may or may not be &#x27;sporting,&#x27; but its wrongness is not a matter that would trouble them for a moment. Sinai, for them, is wrapped in impenetrable cloud. And if we are not prepared to adapt the laws of Sinai to the principles of the night club and &quot;thé dansant&quot;, I see no other alternative but to educate again our young in the eternal verities on which the law is based.&quot;
The Court of Appeal endorsed the judge&#x27;s description of the accused as adulterers: &quot;Now, the learned judge, in his summing-up to the jury, spoke of the charge as a common or ordinary charge of a wife and an adulterer murdering the husband. That was a true and appropriate description.&quot; The deficit in evidence as to direct arrangement was conceded by the Court of Appeal. However, it pursued a line of reasoning to the effect that proof of instigation of murder in a community of purpose without evidence of rebuttal raises an &quot;inference of preconcerted arrangement&quot;. The Court of Appeal held that her earlier prolonged incitement to murder revealed in her letters, combined with her lies about what happened on the night of the murder told to several witnesses, up until her second witness statement, which was open to being found untrustworthy, her meetings with Bywaters on the day of the murder, and the content of her last letter, was sufficient to convict her of arranging the murder.
The Court of Appeal seemed to take a narrower approach to &quot;principal in the second degree&quot; than the Court, but it is unclear, because &quot;preconcerted arrangement&quot; admits of different shades of meaning. The Court of Appeal seemed determined to forestall any argument based on the mere method or timing of the murder being unagreed to, if there was other plausible evidence of a preconcerted object of murder. Its narrow judgment is unsatisfactory to those who now allege Edith played no part in the murder itself. However, its judgement is limited in extent to the point it was addressing, which was continuity of purpose up until the commission of the murder. If non-agreement as to the means and timing of the murder be conceded, there was merit to its claim that the case &quot;exhibits from beginning to end no redeeming feature&quot;.

In his address to the jury Curtis-Bennett attempted to cast her adultery as defensible in the context of the &quot;glamorous aura&quot; of a &quot;great love&quot;, seeking to overlook the point continually being made by the judge at the trial that the case concerned only an adulterer and an (adulterous) wife. In his summing-up, Curtis-Bennett said of Edith:
&quot;This is not an ordinary charge of murder ... Am I right or wrong in saying that this woman is one of the most extraordinary personalities that you or I have ever met? ... Have you ever read ... more beautiful language of love? Such things have been very seldom put by pen upon paper. This is the woman you have to deal with, not some ordinary woman. She is one of those striking personalities met with from time to time who stand out for some reason or another ... You are men of the world and you must know that where there is a liaison which includes some one who is married, it will be part of the desire of that person to keep secret the relations from the other partner. It is not the sort of thing that they would bring to the knowledge of their partner for life.&quot;
Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett KC later claimed that he could have saved her had she not rejected his advice not to take the witness stand. His failure to secure her acquittal had affected him deeply. He maintained her innocence of murder throughout his life, claiming that Edith &quot;paid the extreme penalty for her immorality&quot;. In &quot;Notable British Trials&quot;, Filson Young takes a similar approach, suggesting that Curtis-Bennett should have resigned his brief at her insistence on going into the witness box, although his quest for fame and fortune could never have allowed it. The famous defender Sir Edward Marshall Hall KC similarly stated that he would have surrendered his defence brief if she had defied him the way she did Curtis-Bennett. Curtis-Bennett said to Mr Stanley Bishop, a journalist, &quot;She spoiled her chances by her evidence and by her demeanour. I had a perfect answer to everything which I am sure would have won an acquittal if she had not been a witness. She was a vain woman and an obstinate one. She had an idea that she could carry the jury. Also she realised the enormous public interest, and decided to play up to it by entering the witness-box. Her imagination was highly developed, but it failed to show her the mistake she was making.&quot; One mistake that Edith appeared to make was in testifying that Bywaters had led her into the poison plots. Delusion was no defence to murder and this could not save her. Curtis-Bennett argued a more legally secure but evidentially weak defence based on Edith acting the part of poisoner, or engaging in a fantasy. The fact that the two Home Office pathologists, Sir Bernard Spilsbury and Dr John Webster, both concluded categorically in their independent post mortem reports that there were no traces of poison or glass in Percy Thompson&#x27;s body should have been proof of the fantasy defence.

One of her main lines of defence – that she was constantly seeking a divorce or separation from her husband, and that it rather than murder was the main object of the attested five-year compact between her and Bywaters shown in her letters – was dismissed by the judge as a sham. &quot;If you think these letters are genuine, they mean that she is involved in a continual practice of deceit; concealing the fact of her connection with Bywaters, and not reiterating it with requests for her husband to let her go.&quot;
Filson Young argues that the defence used the wrong tactics. He said: &quot;If the defence had said on behalf of Mrs Thompson, &#x27;I did not murder Percy Thompson, I had nothing to do with it. I had no knowledge of it, and I was stunned and horrified when it took place, and I defy the prosecution to introduce any evidence with which that denial is not absolutely compatible,&#x27; and had rested on that, I do not think you could have found a British jury to convict her.&quot; There is undoubtedly an air of a presumption of guilt surrounding her trial. However, Young&#x27;s point – that the burden of proof was on the Crown to prove murder, rather than on the defence to rebut a presumption of murder – is certainly a valid one.
The judge, Mr Justice Shearman, placed much weight on inconsistencies in her evidence, particularly her statements to the police concerning the night of the murder that suggested she had intended to conceal her witness of the crime, and perhaps conversations of criminal intent with Bywaters preceding it, although she always vigorously denied foreknowledge of it. In &quot;The Innocence of Edith Thompson&quot;, Lewis Broad states that the judge&#x27;s summing up was considered to be at the time &quot;deadly, absolutely against her&quot; and that he &#x27;was pressing the case much more strongly than the Solicitor-General had done.&#x27;
The defence did succeed in some points, showing that guesswork by the prosecution over ambiguous content of some of the letters was fanciful and wrong. An autopsy on Percy Thompson had failed to reveal any evidence that he had been fed ground glass or any type of detectable poison. That her letters did not necessarily reflect her deeds in respect of the so-termed poison plots was fairly clear. Even though perceived in her favour by Lewis Broad, Filson Young, Edgar Lustgarten, René Weis, Laura Thompson and other students of the case, the Court of Appeal held the poison-plots against her and against him: &quot;If the question is, as I think it was, whether these letters were evidence of a protracted, continuous incitement to Bywaters to commit the crime which he did in the end commit, it really is of comparatively little importance whether the appellant was truly reporting something which she had done, or falsely reporting something which she merely pretended to do.&quot; Moreover, &quot;it matters not whether those letters show or, at any rate, go to show, that there was between this appellant and Mrs Thompson an agreement tending to the same end. Those letters were material as throwing light, not only upon the question by whom was this deed done, but what was the intent, what was the purpose with which it was done&quot; said the Court of Appeal to Bywaters.

James Douglas, the chief reporter for the &quot;Express&quot; papers covering the trial in 1922/23, also took issue with the verdict, writing &quot;I think the hanging of Mrs Thompson is a miscarriage of mercy and justice ... I believe she was an adulteress. But we do not hang a woman for adultery. The Mosaic Law stoned the adulteress to death. Our law punishes adultery by divorce, not by death. Therefore, in judging Mrs Thompson we must not mix up the crime of murder with the sin of adultery ... Let us condemn her as being guilty of all she charges herself with in her letters. Having done so, let us see what she is not guilty of.
1. It was not her hand that struck down her husband.
2. Her husband did not die by poison or powdered glass administered by her hand.
3. There is no evidence that she put poison or glass in his food.
4. There is no evidence that at any time in any way she ever made any attempt on the life of her husband.
5. There is no evidence that she was guilty or premeditated connivance, collusion, or complicity in the actual crime.
6. There is no evidence that she was an accessory before the fact, apart from the incitements in her own letters.
7. There is no evidence that she actually aided and abetted the striking of the fatal blows.
8. There is no evidence of wilful murder against her. Therefore, in her case murder is not murder, but merely a legal extension of the legal definition of murder. It is a moral, not a physical, crime. It is a sin of the soul, and not a consummation of sin in the act of slaying.
I might amplify this catalogue of the innocence or non-guiltiness of Mrs Thompson, but my eight points suffice to drive home my argument that her guilt stopped short of wilful murder if only by a hair&#x27;s breadth was a broad abyss separating the will from the deed.
One last word. If Mrs Thompson had not been walking with her husband when he was murdered, would the jury have found her guilty of wilful murder? Why should she be hanged by reason of what may have been the unforeseen accident of her presence?&quot;

In &quot;Verdict in Dispute&quot; (1949), Edgar Lustgarten states that &quot;The Thompson verdict is now recognized as bad, and the trial from which it sprang stands out as an example of the evils that may flow from an attitude of mind.&quot; He continues with &quot;There was no failure of law; there was no failure of procedure; there was no failure to observe and abide by all the rules. It was from first to last a failure in human understanding; a failure to grasp and comprehend a personality not envisaged in the standard legal textbooks and driven by forces far more powerful and eternal than those that are studied in the Inns of Court.&quot; From this it may be reasonably surmised that his essay is something of an apology for Edith, whose culpability he diminishes on the basis that &quot;she was a woman of quality whose talents were frustrated&quot;. He adds: &quot;She was a remarkable and complex personality, endowed with signal attributes of body and of mind. She had intelligence, vitality, a natural grace and poise, sensitiveness, humour and illumining all these that quintessential femininity that fascinates the male.&quot; He writes: &quot;[In the absence of her letters] all that could be said against her was that she had lied in a futile attempt to protect and cover Bywaters. That might make her an accessory after the fact. It could not bring her into danger of the rope.&quot; Although Lustgarten does not allege any defect in legal procedure, he says that the Court was unable to understand questions of &quot;sex and psychology&quot; and the consequent possibility of fantasy.

A critique of the conduct of her trial and the state of the law was made by Lewis Broad. He argued that it was the misfortune of Edith Thompson that she was unable to separate herself from the prejudice due to her immorality whereas, if it had been a former crime, she was entitled not to have it mentioned. He also attacked the judge for using morally prejudiced language to incite the prejudice of the jury. He concedes that it was within the rules for the jury to decide what the words in Edith&#x27;s letters meant and what was intended by them. Broad went on to attack the general conduct of the trial:
1. She should have been granted a separate trial in that she was handicapped by having to appear alongside Bywaters.
2. The judge allowed the jury to be inflamed by prejudice on account of her immorality.
3. Suspicion based on prejudice was allowed to take the place of proof of meaning, motive and intention in respect of her letters.
Broad also levels criticism against the prosecution for the unfair use of her letters at trial, covering such matters as:
a) 1,500 word extract used at trial from 25,000 words in total, which in turn were less than half of her total of 51,000 or so words. Many of the letters were censored by the court during the trial, because they dealt with subjects such as menstruation and orgasm, subjects that were not then considered fit for public discussion.
b) There was only one unambiguous reference to poison in the five months preceding the murder.
c) The meaning of uncertain phrases were allowed to be suggested by the Crown and were determined to prejudice the jury.
d) The context of the murder suggested no element of planning.
e) Despite their meandering and casual discussion of the subject matter, Percy&#x27;s murder, there is nothing in the letters that amounted to agreement or one.
f) There was a break in the chain of causation after Bywaters had indicated he did not want to continue to see Edith, evidenced from her letters from 20 June to 12 September 1922.
g) That the letters were part of a fantasy between the parties was not put forth to the jury.

The &quot;broken chain&quot; theory of the case, favoured by Broad, arguing that there is no causal link between Edith&#x27;s letters and the actual murder, because of the length of time separating them and the manner of the murder, is developed by the UCL professor of jurisprudence William Twining. In &quot;Rethinking Evidence: Exploratory Essays&quot; (2006), pp. 344–396, Twining argues that a Wigmorean, &quot;decompositional&quot; analysis of the charges brought against Edith Thompson demonstrates how unsatisfactory the verdict against her was in law. Twining writes that &quot;For the prosecution to convict Edith, they had to prove that the attack was premeditated. Even if one totally discounts Freddy&#x27;s evidence about the events of the evening (and his story of the period up to 11 p.m. was generally consistent and was largely corroborated by the Graydons), there is almost nothing to support the proposition that the attack was premeditated. There was no evidence to support the proposition that the knife was purchased recently in order to attack Percy; there was no evidence in support of the proposition that Bywaters put the knife in his pocket that morning because he planned to attack Percy – the best that the prosecution could do was point out that there was no corroboration for his claim that he was in the habit of carrying it.&quot; The &quot;tea-room&quot; passage (exhibit 60) – &quot;Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room, I’ll still risk and try if you will – we only have 3½ years left darlingest. Try and help.” – was interpreted by the judge as referring to either poisoning Percy Thompson or to using a dagger. This was also the prosecution theory, that &quot;what&quot; referred to killing Percy; the defence claimed that &quot;what&quot; referred to Freddy trying to find Edith a post abroad so that they could elope. Twining argues that a close Wigmorean analysis allows for the following conclusions: &quot;For example, the judge&#x27;s suggestion can be attacked on the following grounds:
1. it is sheer speculation, with no evidence to support it;
2. it involves a &quot;petitio principii&quot; in that it assumes what is seeks to prove;
3. it does not make sense of the passage: ‘Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room [about whether to use poison or a dagger], I’ll still risk and try if you will we have only 3 years left darlingest.’&quot;
Twining continues with &quot;Even if we totally discount testimony of both accused that it referred to eloping (the ‘risks’ being financial and/or of social stigma), the context of the letter as a whole and the words ‘3½ years left’ both tend to support the judgement that an innocent explanation is a good deal more likely than the prosecution&#x27;s interpretation. At the, very least, such factors seem to me to cast a reasonable doubt on that interpretation, yet this passage was the main item of evidence in support of the conspiracy theory.&quot;

A feminist review of the case occurs in Laura Thompson&#x27;s 2018 book, &quot;Rex v Edith Thompson: A Tale of Two Murders&quot;. Thompson (not a relative) claims that Edith Thompson was the victim of a highly prejudicial &quot;gendered&quot; trial, with the trial judge&#x27;s and the Appeal Court judges&#x27; bias against the accused woman playing a key part in her conviction.

In March 2018 the BBC presented a thoughtful evaluation in an episode of the series &quot;Murder, Mystery and My Family&quot; in which barristers Sasha Wass and Jeremy Dein reviewed the case. Although they were unable to determine any new evidence, they agreed that there were serious issues to be addressed regarding the final summing up by the trial judge, Mr Justice Shearman. Despite acting as prosecution and defence, Wass and Dein presented a joint submission to Senior Crown Court Judge David Radford for consideration, arguing that there was no case to answer by Edith Thompson with regard to the charge that was brought against her. Judge Radford gave his opinion that the summing up in the case was deficient and had failed to offer correct direction to the jury. He considered that it had been unfair and unbalanced and that there were grounds for coming to a decision that the conviction of Edith Thompson was both unsafe and unsatisfactory. This was followed by a second BBC Two programme in 2019, with the same participants, to take account of the reburial of Edith Thompson in November 2018.

== Application for a posthumous pardon for Edith Thompson ==
In January 2023 it was reported that an application for a posthumous pardon for Edith Thompson, using the royal prerogative of mercy, would be reconsidered by the Ministry of Justice; the application, made on behalf of Thompson&#x27;s heir and executor, René Weis, had initially been rejected in 2022 by the then Justice Secretary Dominic Raab.
On 6 March 2023 BBC News reported that the Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab, had referred René Weis’s application on behalf of Edith Thompson to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), &quot;as a potential miscarriage of justice&quot;. The BBC quotes Mr Raab’s letter to Prof Weis stating that this will
&quot;allow a full investigation of your application to take place&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; of 7 March 2023 heads its piece on the CCRC referral with &quot;Pardon for hanged woman is step nearer after 100 years&quot;.

<text>George Onions VC (2 March 1883 – 2 April 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Onions was born in Bilston Staffordshire. He had a varied early life working in mining and as a commercial traveller. He spent three years in Australia and at the start of the War was an Iron and Steel Merchant living in Scotland and married with a son. On the declaration of War he enlisted with the 3rd Hussars and was involved in the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916.

Onions was commissioned into The Rifle Brigade in September 1916. In December 1916 he was involved in a fracas in a London restaurant. He was found to be absent without leave and was court martialed and cashiered. Given the shortage of experienced junior officers this would seem to be unduly harsh. Most Commanding Officers preferred to deal with junior officers&#x27; misdemeanours in house. There were fewer than 60 cashierings in the entire war. There may have been other reasons why 2Lt Onions was dealt with so severely.

Onions immediately reenlisted as a private in the Devonshire Regiment. He was determined to redeem himself and insisted on returning to the Front as soon as possible. He was back in France by April 1917.

Onions was 35 years old, and a Lance-Corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Devonshire Regiment, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On the foggy morning of 22 August 1918, south of Achiet-le-Petit, France, Lance-Corporal Onions had been sent out with Private Henry Eades to make contact with the battalion on their right flank when they saw the enemy advancing in large numbers to counter-attack the positions gained the previous day. Seizing the opportunity, they boldly placed themselves on the flank of the advancing enemy and opened fire. When the enemy were about 100 yards from them the line wavered and some hands were thrown up, whereupon Lance-Corporal Onions rushed forward and, helped by his comrade, took about 200 of the enemy prisoner. He then formed them up in column of fours and marched them back to his company commander.

Private Eades was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal but died of wounds that he received only a few days later.

On his application Onions had his commissioned restored into the Rifle Brigade in August 1919. However, it was an honorary apportionment as he had to resign the commission on the same day. Like many temporary gentlemen Onions found life difficult after the War. He served in the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary. He lost two jobs due to neglect and in June 1925 was changed with fraud - namely bouncing a cheque for £5:00. He was treated leniently due to his military service and previous good record. In 1939 he was commissioned a captain in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment for National Defence, but resigned his commission in 1941.

He was killed in a motoring accident in 1944.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Keep Military Museum, Dorchester, Dorset, England.

<text>The Denver Art Museum (DAM) is an art museum located in the Civic Center of Denver, Colorado. With an encyclopedic collection of more than 70,000 diverse works from across the centuries and world, the DAM is one of the largest art museums between the West Coast and Chicago. It is known for its collection of American Indian art, as well as The Petrie Institute of Western American Art, which oversees the museum&#x27;s Western art collection. The museum&#x27;s Martin Building (formerly known as the North Building) was designed by famed Italian architect Gio Ponti in 1971.

In 2018, the museum began a transformational $150 million renovation project to unify the campus and revitalize Ponti&#x27;s original structure, including the creation of new exhibition spaces, two new dining options, and a new welcome center.

==History==

=== 1893–1923 ===
The museum&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the founding of the Denver Artists Club in 1893. The Club renamed itself the Denver Art Association in 1917 and opened its first galleries in the City and County building two years later. The museum opened galleries in the Chappell House in 1922. The house, located on Logan Street, was donated to the museum by Mrs. George Cranmer and Delos Chappell. In 1923, the Denver Art Association became the Denver Art Museum (DAM).

=== 1948–1974 ===
In 1948, the DAM purchased a building on Acoma and 14th Avenue on the south side of Civic Center Park. Denver architect Burnham Hoyt renovated the building, which opened as the Schleier Memorial Gallery in 1949. While the Schleier Gallery was a significant addition, the DAM still sought to increase its space. Additional pressure came from the Kress Foundation, who offered to donate three collections valued at over $2 million on the condition that DAM construct a new building to house the works. DAM sought help from the city and county of Denver to raise funds. However, in 1952 voters failed to approve a resolution bond. Despite this setback, the museum continued to raise funds and eventually opened a new building, the South Wing (now known as the Bach Wing), in 1954. This made it possible for DAM to receive the three Kress Foundation collections.

The North Building, a seven-story 210,000-square-foot addition, opened in 1971. The building was designed by Italian modernist architect Gio Ponti, with local architects James Sudler Associates of Denver. Ponti said, &quot;Art is a treasure, and these thin but jealous walls defend it.&quot; It is his only completed design built in the United States. Ponti designed the DAM building to break from the traditional museum archetypes. The two-towered &quot;castle-like&quot; façade has 24 sides, and more than one million reflective glass tiles, designed by Dow Corning, cover the building&#x27;s exterior.

The museum is included in the area of the Civic Center Historic District, which was listed on
the National Register of Historic Places. The museum building was deemed &quot;non-contributing&quot;.&quot;

=== 2006–present ===
The Duncan Pavilion and the Frederic C. Hamilton Building were both added to the museum in 2006. The Duncan Pavilion, a 5,700-square-foot second story addition to the Bach Wing, was created to accommodate the bridge traffic from the new Hamilton Building and the existing North Building (1971). Duncan Pavilion was designed to be kid- and family-friendly while also suitable for multi-use, including the museum&#x27;s &quot;Untitled Final Friday&quot; series as well as wedding receptions and other events.
In December 2016, the Denver Art Museum announced a transformational $150 million project to unify the museum&#x27;s campus and revitalize Ponti&#x27;s building (now called the Martin Building), including the creation of new gallery spaces, two new dining options and the new Sie Welcome Center. With architecture and design led by Machado Silvetti and Denver-based Fentress Architects, the renovation project is slated for completion in 2021 in time for the 50th anniversary of Ponti&#x27;s original building. The Duncan Pavilion was demolished in 2019.

===Hamilton Building===

The Frederic C. Hamilton Building houses the museum&#x27;s Modern and Contemporary Art, African Art and Oceanic Art collections, along with part of the Western American art collection and special exhibition spaces. Designed as a joint venture by Studio Daniel Libeskind and Denver firm Davis Partnership Architects (architect of record), the glass and titanium- clad building opened on October 7, 2006. Recognized by the American Institute of Architects as a successful Building Information Modeling project, the Hamilton Building is Libeskind&#x27;s first completed building in the United States.
Recognized for its bold design, the four-story, 146,000 square foot, the Hamilton building serves as the main entrance to the rest of the museum complex. This project doubled the size of the museum, allowing for an expansion of the art on view.

The angular design of the Hamilton building juts in many directions, supported by a 2,740-ton structure that contains more than 3,100 pieces of steel. One of the angled elements extends 167 feet over and 100 feet above the street below. None of the 20 planes is parallel or perpendicular to another.

Similar to the many-peaked roof of the Denver International Airport, the Hamilton Building emulates the sharp angles of the nearby Rocky Mountains, as well as the geometric crystals found at the mountains&#x27; base near Denver. Architect Daniel Libeskind said, &quot;I was inspired by the light and geology of the Rockies, but most of all by the wide-open faces of the people of Denver.&quot;

;Context
Regarding the design concept, Libeskind commented, &quot;The project is not designed as a standalone building but as part of a composition of public spaces, monuments and gateways in this developing part of the city, contributing to the synergy amongst neighbors large and intimate.&quot;

Libeskind designed a landscaped pedestrian plaza for the DAM complex. Sculptures on display include &#x27;Scottish Angus Cow and Calf&#x27; by Dan Ostermiller, &#x27;Big Sweep&#x27; by Coosje van Bruggen and Claes Oldenburg, and &#x27;Denver Monoliths&#x27; by Beverly Pepper.

;Awards
Due to the distinct configuration of the steel to produce the building, the Hamilton Building expansion of the DAM received a Presidential Award of Excellence from the American Institute of Steel Construction—AISC’s 2007 Innovative Design in Engineering and Architecture with Structural Steel (IDEAS2) Awards competition.

;Architectural reviews
The design of the Hamilton extension of DAM has received mixed reviews. Christopher Hawthorne, architecture critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said the architectural achievement of the building does not mean it works well as a museum. He called the Hamilton Building &quot;a stunning piece of architectural sculpture,&quot; but &quot;a pretty terrible place for showing and looking at art.&quot; &quot;Museum architecture does not always blend cohesively with a great architectural achievement.&quot;

Lewis Sharp (DAM director, 1989–2009) said one of the most thrilling things about the Hamilton Building is that visitors can see the artworks in a new environment, as there are at least 20 different ways to display and hang artists’ work in the sloping and angular galleries. &quot;I think you often see things that you had never seen before,&quot; Sharp said. &quot;It just raises all types of potentially new ways to engage a visitor.&quot;

Some visitors and Denver residents appreciate the design, such as the Andreesons, who said, &quot;We’re in normal looking buildings every single day. It’s just kind of an experience to walk into a room that doesn’t look like rooms that we would normally be in.&quot; Sharp said that was exactly what the museum was looking for in their expansion. He said the museum&#x27;s board was seeking the opportunity to draw people to the city.

===Martin Building===

On January 10, 2018, the Denver Art Museum broke ground on a comprehensive renovation of its North Building—the only completed structure in North America designed by Italian architect Gio Ponti. One of the first-ever high rise art museums, the North Building was renamed in 2019 in honor of Lanny and Sharon Martin, who made the lead gift of $25 million to revitalize the building as part of the museum&#x27;s ongoing campus transformation project. Additionally, the Elevate Denver Bond Program contributed $35.5 million in funding to DAM&#x27;s project.

The renovation includes updates to all seven floors of galleries, the creation of new learning and engagement spaces, as well as a new restaurant, café, and the Sie Welcome Center. The design includes skylights, which reveal new aspects of his design, and exterior site improvements such as lighting as well as revitalizing the glass tiles on the façade of the building. Machado Silvetti and Denver-based Fentress Architects are the design teams behind the $150 million project slated for reopening timed to the building&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2021.

When Ponti&#x27;s original structure was built in 1971, it was designed to accommodate 100,000 visitors per year. In 2017, the museum estimated an average attendance of 850,000 visitors annually. To accommodate growing audiences, the museum&#x27;s renovation project will add more than 72,000 square feet (6,689 m2) of new and refurbished gallery and visitor spaces, in addition to the implementation of crucial safety and infrastructure upgrades.

===Sie Welcome Center===

As part of the Denver Art Museum&#x27;s major transformation project, the new Sie Welcome Center was constructed to create a new visitor-friendly entrance to the Martin Building and as a connector to the Hamilton Building. Named in honor of Anna and John J. Sie who pledged $12 million in support of the project, the round, glass-clad structure designed by Machado Silvetti and Fentress Architects will serve as the Martin Building&#x27;s new visitor entrance and ticketing center.

When the Sie Welcome Center opens, it will be home to The Ponti, a restaurant focused on local ingredients led by chef Jennifer Jasinski, as well as a more casual café for lighter fare. On the second floor of the Sie Welcome Center is the Sturm Grand Pavilion, one of downtown Denver&#x27;s largest and most distinctive special event spaces. Over 10,000 square feet, the pavilion&#x27;s curved, glass panels offer a view of the city.

Bonfils-Stanton Foundation Galleries

As part of the Martin Building renovation, the new Bonfils-Stanton Foundation Galleries will present 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of new gallery space for the museum&#x27;s permanent collection. Reclaiming square footage previously used for art storage, this completely renovated space on level one of the Martin Building will be dedicated to temporary exhibitions pulled from the museum&#x27;s extensive global art collections.

New Design Galleries

As part of the renovation of the museum&#x27;s Martin Building (formerly known as the North Building), Machado Silvetti and Fentress Architects horizontally bisected the Martin Building&#x27;s original Bonfils-Stanton Gallery on level one to create 10,000 square feet (929 m2) of new gallery space on the second level within the original footprint of the building: the Joanne Posner-Mayer Mezzanine Gallery, the Amanda J. Precourt Design Galleries, and the Ellen Bruss Design Studio. To realize the interior design of these new exhibition spaces, the museum partnered with New York-based design firm OMA, who collaborated with the museum previously for the 2018 blockbuster exhibition Dior: From Paris to the World.

===Duncan Pavilion=== 
The Duncan Pavilion was a second story addition to the Bach Wing of the Denver Art Museum and opened in February 2006. The pavilion was demolished in 2017, and the site is now the location of the Sie Welcome Center, part of the museum&#x27;s transformational renovation project. The Duncan Pavilion served as a link between the Daniel Libeskind-designed Hamilton Building and the 1971 Gio Ponti-designed North Building.
The project&#x27;s intent included preserving the integrity of the oldest part of the museum, the Bach Wing built in 1954, while providing a significant mechanical upgrade for it.

The Duncan Pavilion&#x27;s open assembly area received the pedestrian bridge from the Hamilton Building with a pedestrian elevator and glass staircase linking pedestrian traffic to the Signature Gallery on the first floor. An upgraded extension of the existing freight elevator created the final link in the system facilitating artwork traffic between buildings so that artwork could be received and serviced in the Hamilton Building and transported to and from the Ponti building&#x27;s galleries without exiting the protective environment of the museum.

==Collections==
The Denver Art Museum has nine curatorial departments: African Art; Architecture and Design; Art of the Ancient Americas; Asian Art; Modern and Contemporary; Native Arts (African, American Indian and Oceanic); New World (pre-Columbian and Spanish Colonial); Painting and Sculpture (European and American); Photography; Western Art; and Textile Art and Fashion.

=== African Art ===
The collection of African art is made up of roughly 1,000 pieces, mostly from the 19th and 20th centuries. It includes many rare works in sculpture, textiles, jewelry, painting, printmaking, and drawings. While a majority of their collection focuses on west African works, there are pieces from many regions and mediums, such as wood, metals, fibers, terra cotta, and mixed media compositions.

=== Art of the Ancient Americas ===
The museum&#x27;s Ancient Americas collection covers over four thousand years of art, including historic works from peoples and communities throughout Mesoamerica, Central and South America, and the Caribbean and Southwestern United States. The department was formed in 1968, and is known for its collection of Central American ceramics, jade, and stone sculpture.

===Architecture and Design===
The Denver Art Museum&#x27;s Architecture, Design and Graphics department was founded in 1990 by former director Lewis I. Sharp. The collection has concentrations in areas including Italian design from the 1960s and 1970s, American graphic design from the 1950s to the present day, post-World War II furniture and product design in America and western Europe and contemporary western European and Japanese design.

===Asian Art===
The museum&#x27;s Asian art collection includes galleries devoted to the arts of India, China, Japan and Southwestern Asia, as well as works from Tibet, Nepal and Southeast Asia. The collection, which originated in 1915 with a donation of Chinese and Japanese art objects, spans a period from the fourth millennium B.C. to the present.

===European and American Art Before 1900===
The Denver Art Museum began receiving significant examples of European from the 1930s with Horace Havemyer&#x27;s donations of works by Corot, Courbet, and Millet and seven others. From 1932 onwards, funds from the Helen Dill Bequest enabled the museum to acquire works by Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir as well as paintings by American artists Thomas Hart Benton, Winslow Homer, John Twachtman, and William Merritt Chase. The Dill bequest comprised thirty-seven works purchased for a sum of $65,650 by 1961.

Artists represented include Claude Monet (&quot;Waterlilies&quot;), Camille Pissarro (&quot;Autumn, Poplars, Éragny&quot;), Winslow Homer (&quot;Two Figures by the Sea&quot;), Gustave Courbet (&quot;Valley of the Black Pool&quot;), Lucien Lévy-Dhurmer (&quot;The Dolomites&quot;), Edgar Degas (&quot;Examen de Danse&quot;), Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (&quot;Deucalion and Pyrrha&quot;), Giuseppe Arcimboldo (&quot;Summer&quot;) and Thomas Cole (&quot;Dream of Arcadia&quot;).

;The Berger Collection
The Berger Collection is a major private collection largely of British art that includes approximately 200 works and spans more than six centuries. Renaissance portraits, including works by Hans Holbein the Younger, are a strength of the collection. Other artists represented include Nicholas Hilliard, Thomas Gainsborough, Angelica Kauffman, Benjamin West, Edward Lear and David Hockney.

==== The Hamilton Collection ====
Frederic C. Hamilton bequeathed 22 Impressionist works from his private collection to the museum in 2014, including Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Edge of a Wheat Field With Poppies&quot;, fours works by Claude Monet, three paintings by Eugène Boudin and works by Paul Cézanne, Edouard Manet, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, William Merritt Chase and Childe Hassam.

===Indigenous Arts of North America===
Works by contemporary artists such as Jeffrey Gibson, Kent Monkman, D.Y. Begay, Rose B. Simpson, Fritz Scholder, T.C. Cannon, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, James Luna, Marie Watt, Nicholas Galanin, Virgil Ortiz, Roxanne Swentzell, Nora Naranjo Morse, Julie Buffalohead, Wendy Red Star, Cannupa Hanska Luger, Edgar Heap of Birds, Rick Bartow, Cara Romero, Shan Goshorn, Diego Romero (artist), Harry Fonseca, Kay WalkingStick, Melanie Yazzie, David Bradley (Native American artist), Truman Lowe, Norval Morrisseau, Allan Houser, Will Wilson (photographer), Jim Denomie, Dyani White Hawk, Jamie Okuma, James Lavadour, Gail Tremblay, Preston Singletary, Bently Spang, Richard Zane Smith, and Dan Namingha are included in the collection.

=== Latin American Art ===
In the United States, the Denver Art Museum currently houses the largest collection of art produced in Latin America between the 1600s and the 1800s. It is made up of over 6,000 objects, representing historic works from Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Southwestern United States. Spanish Colonial Period paintings on display include 17th and 18th Century paintings by these painters associated with Mexico: Cristobal Villalpando, Juan Correa, Luis Juarez, Gaspar Munoz de Salazar, Diego Borgraf, and Sebastian Lopez de Arteaga.

===Modern and Contemporary Art===
DAM&#x27;s Modern and Contemporary art collection includes works by artists including Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Henri Matisse and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, as well as 33 paintings, drawings and collages by the acclaimed abstract expressionist Robert Motherwell. The collection also holds representative works from the major post-war art movements, including abstract expressionism, minimalism, pop art, conceptual art and contemporary realism. The department includes the Herbert Bayer Collection and Archive, containing more than 8000 objects.

;Herbert Bayer Collection and Archive
The Herbert Bayer Collection and Archive contains over 8,000 works, along with extensive documentary material. This repository is dedicated to the legacy of the Austrian-born Bauhaus master who lived in Colorado for 28 years. The core of this collection and archive came through the artist&#x27;s bequest, and scholars visit from around the world to engage the collection for research. While the Bayer art works are part of the Denver Art Museum&#x27;s Modern and Contemporary Art collection, and works not on public view are available for scholarly study by appointment. The archive of non-art materials was transferred to the Denver Public Library in September 2018.

;&quot;Linda&quot;
A visitor favorite, &quot;Linda&quot;, by Denver artist John DeAndrea, is a life-size realistic sculpture of a sleeping woman. Made of polyvinyl, the piece is sunlight-sensitive and is shown only for short periods of time. It is so lifelike people often think it is breathing.

;&quot;The Shootout&quot;
In 1983 the museum became the home of the controversial pop-art sculpture &quot;The Shootout&quot; by Red Grooms. It represents a cowboy and an Indian shooting at one another. The sculpture, now on the roof of the museum restaurant, had been evicted from two other downtown Denver locations after Native American activists protested and threatened to deface the work. The sculpture was removed from view in November 2017, and the display space where it had been located was replaced with the Sie Welcome Center, which opened to the public in October 2021.

;&quot;AS TO BE IN PLAIN SIGHT&quot;
One of the most photogenic pieces in the museum, the piece is an aluminum cutout of the words &quot;AS TO BE IN PLAIN SIGHT&quot; made by contemporary artist Lawrence Weiner. The piece is hung on a wall in the museum&#x27;s third floor, and the view of it is obscured from most points of the museum, ironically hiding it in plain sight. The piece was originally on display outside the museum, but was moved to its current location in 2009.

=== Oceanic Art ===
The Oceanic art collection encompasses about 1,000 objects, with an emphasis on 20th century New Guinea art and 19th century Polynesian art. These collections include works of sculpture, bark cloth, wood carvings, and even some work by contemporary artists.

===Photography===
The DAM established a dedicated curatorial department to photography in 2008. The department&#x27;s collection includes numerous 19th-century works, notably of the American West, as well as holdings of European and American modernist photography. Works by early Western photographers William Bell and Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan, 19th-century artists William Henry Fox Talbot and Henry Bosse and modernist photographers such as Gyorgi Kepes and Man Ray are included in the collection.

=== Textile and Fashion ===
The Textile Art and Fashion department of the museum houses over 5,000 pieces from Asia, Europe and North and South America. These pieces form a collection that spans from archaeological textiles to contemporary works of art and fashion from the 18th century to the modern day.

===Western American Art===
The institute is organized to support the study, collection, preservation and exhibition of art created about the American West, its people, its history and its landscape. &quot;In the Enemy&#x27;s Country&quot; by Charles M. Russell, &quot;The Cheyenne&quot; by Frederic Remington and &quot;Long Jakes, &quot;The Rocky Mountain Man&quot;&quot; by Charles Deas are the anchors for the museum&#x27;s collection. Other highlights include Thomas Moran&#x27;s &quot;Mount of the Holy Cross&quot;, Albert Bierstadt&#x27;s &quot;Wind River Country&quot; and E. Martin Hennings&#x27; &quot;Rabbit Hunt&quot;.

;The Harmsen Collection
In 2001, the Western American Art collection was augmented by a gift of more than 700 art objects from the Bill and Dorothy Harmsen Family; this was the impetus for establishing the institute of western American art at the DAM. The institute received its new title—the Petrie Institute of Western American Art—in 2007, following a gift from the Thomas A. Petrie family to partially endow the department.

==== The Roath Collection ====
In 2013, the museum received a gift of American art from Henry Roath that doubled the importance of its existing western collection. The Roath Collection comprises more than 50 works, ranging in date from 1877 to 1972, by artists such as Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Moran, Frederic Remington and Ernest L. Blumenschein.

==Selected collection highlights==
==Learning and Engagement==
The museum&#x27;s Learning &amp; Engagement department has emphasized three areas: 1) Research in making museum visits successful and enjoyable; 2) Creation of installed learning materials (e.g., audio tours, labeling, video and reading areas, response journals and hands-on and artmaking areas); and 3) Interactive learning for young people both in school and family groups. Family-friendly programs and activities include the Just for Fun Family Center, gallery games, the Discovery Library, Kids Corner and Family Backpacks. Access programs at the DAM include Art &amp; About tours, for visitors with early-stage Alzheimer&#x27;s or dementia; Low Sensory Mornings; and Tactile Tables.

A key priority of the Denver Art Museum&#x27;s ongoing campus transformation project is to center the DAM&#x27;s educational programs at the heart of the campus. The new Bartlit Learning and Engagement Center features more than 12,000 square-feet of flexible programming space, workshop rooms and the Singer Pollack Family Wonderscape, which will present student-created exhibitions and host school and community events. With interactive spaces designed by Mexico City-based Esrawe + Cadena, the interactive Bartlit Center also features the Morgridge Creative Hub. Spanning more than 5,600 square-feet.

==Funding==
The museum is run by a non-profit organization separate from the City of Denver. Major funding for the museum is provided by a 0.1% sales tax levied in the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD), which includes seven Colorado counties (Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas and Jefferson) in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The district provides funding to about 300 arts, cultural and scientific organizations in the seven counties. About 65% of this tax is used to provide funding for the Denver Art Museum and four other major science and cultural facilities in Denver: the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Zoo, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. In addition, the museum receives large private donations and loans from private collections. Over the past five years, the Denver Art Museum has averaged more than 600,000 visitors a year.

==Media Mentions==
The museum was mentioned in Smithsonian Channel&#x27;s &quot;Aerial America&quot; &quot;Colorado&quot; episode in 2012. Ten years later, it was mentioned in a &quot;How Do they Build That?&quot; episode (also on Smithsonian). In 2022, the Denver Post published an investigative series into the role of Emma Bunker, a museum trustee, in the looted antiquities trade. On January 11, 2024, The Denver Post broke the story that a supermajority of the Denver Art Museum&#x27;s employees announced their intention to unionize wall to wall, including all eligible employees across all departments during the all-staff meeting that morning. Despite the employees having a supermajority of pro-union workers, the director of the museum, Christoph Heinrich, verbally rejected to voluntarily recognize the union during the all-staff, and later in an email to all of the museum&#x27;s employees.

<text>Nunavut is a territory of Canada, inhabited predominantly by the Inuit and to a much smaller degree other members of the First Nations. Inuit folk music has long been based primarily off percussion, used in dance music, as well as vocals, including the famous Inuit throat singing tradition.

Early European immigration brought new styles and instruments to Nunavut, including country music, bluegrass, square dancing, the button accordion and the fiddle.

Drum-led dancing has long been an important part of Inuit life in Nunavut, and was used to mark all the major occasions of life – a birth, changing of the seasons, a successful hunt or a marriage. In a traditional dance, a group of women sat in a circle and sang while men danced one at a time. If no man volunteered to dance, a woman would choose a personal song of one of the men in the audience, and he would be obliged to dance. These dances lasted throughout the night, save for a few tea breaks. By the end of the night, women and children begin participating in the drumming. This dance is rarely performed in the modern era, and is almost always done as attractions for tourists.

Traditional Inuit songs from Nunavut included satirical, obscene, humorous, romantic and jesting songs, as well as rivalry songs, in which enemies insulted each other through lyrics. Most adults had their own personal song, which could be of any type. Personal songs may be given, either to someone bearing the same name, or as an object of appreciation for some help rendered.

Inuit throat-singing is performed by two women standing face to face. They repeat different sounds in a swift rhythm in a form of contest to see who can last the longest.

Modern musicians from Nunavut generally blend traditional Inuit music with mainstream forms of popular music such as rock, pop, country or gospel, though traditional music and other styles retain some popularity.

Well-known musicians from the territory include Lucie Idlout, Itulu Itidlui, Simon Sigjariaq, Mary Atuat Thompson, William Tagoona, Charlie Panigoniak, Tanya Tagaq, Tudjaat, Kelly Fraser, The Jerry Cans, Riit, Northern Haze and Peter and Susan Aningmiuq. Susan Aglukark, a major recording star in Canada, was raised in Arviat in Nunavut.

The True North Concert, held every year, has helped increase coverage of Inuit music.
