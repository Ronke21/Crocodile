<text>Stalag Luft III (; literally &quot;Main Camp, Air, III&quot;; SL III) was a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;-run prisoner-of-war (POW) camp during the Second World War, which held captured Western Allied air force personnel.

The camp was established in March 1942 near the town of Sagan, Lower Silesia, in what was then Nazi Germany (now Żagań, Poland), south-east of Berlin. The site was selected because its sandy soil made it difficult for POWs to escape by tunnelling.

It is best known for two escape plots by Allied POWs. One was in 1943 and became the basis of a fictionalised film, &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; (1950), based on a book by escapee Eric Williams. The second breakout—the so-called Great Escape—of March 1944, was conceived by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was authorised by the senior British officer at Stalag Luft III, Herbert Massey. A fictionalised version of the escape was depicted in the film &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), which was based on a book by former prisoner Paul Brickhill. The camp was liberated by Soviet forces in January 1945. The site of the former POW camp is now the &#x27;Stalag Luft III Prisoner Camp Museum&#x27;.

==Camp life (1942–1944)==

The German military followed a practice whereby each branch of the military was responsible for the POWs of equivalent branches. Hence the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was normally responsible for any Allied aircrew taken prisoner. That included captured naval aviators, such as members of the British Fleet Air Arm. In a few cases, non-air force personnel were also held at Stalag Luft III.

&quot;Stammlager Luft&quot; (literally &quot;Main Camp, Air&quot;) was &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; nomenclature for a POW camp. While the camp initially held only POWs who were officers, it was not known by the usual terms for such camps – &quot;Offizierslager&quot; or &quot;Oflag&quot;. Later camp expansions added compounds for non-commissioned officers (NCOs).

The first compound of the camp (East Compound) was completed and opened on 21 March 1942. The first POWs, or , as they called themselves (from &quot;Kriegsgefangene&quot;, German for &quot;prisoner of war&quot;), to be housed at Stalag Luft III were British and other Commonwealth officers, arriving in April 1942. The Centre Compound was opened on 11 April 1942 and originally held British and other Commonwealth NCOs. By the end of 1942, they were replaced by USAAF personnel. The North Compound for British airmen, (where the &quot;Great Escape&quot; later occurred) opened on 29 March 1943. A South Compound for Americans was opened in September 1943. USAAF prisoners began arriving at the camp in significant numbers the following month and the West Compound was opened in July 1944 for US officers. Each compound consisted of fifteen single-story huts. Each bunkroom slept fifteen men in five triple-deck bunks. Eventually the camp grew to approximately in size and housed about 2,500 RAF officers, about 7,500 US Army Air Force officers and about 900 officers from other Allied air forces, for a total of 10,949 inmates, including some support officers.

The prison camp had a number of design features that made escape extremely difficult. The digging of escape tunnels, in particular, was made difficult by several factors, the barracks housing the prisoners were raised approximately off the ground to make it easier for guards to detect tunnelling; the camp had been constructed on land that had a very sandy subsoil; the surface soil was dark grey, so it could easily be detected if anyone dumped the brighter, yellow sand found beneath it above ground, or even just had some of it on their clothing. The loose, collapsible sand meant the structural integrity of any tunnel would be very poor. A third defence against tunnelling was the placement of seismograph microphones around the perimeter of the camp, which were expected to detect any sounds of digging.

A substantial library with schooling facilities was available, where many POWs studied for and took exams in subjects such as languages, engineering or law. The exams were supplied by the Red Cross and supervised by academics such as a Master of King&#x27;s College who was a POW in Luft III. The prisoners also built a theatre and put on high-quality bi-weekly performances featuring all the current West End shows. The prisoners used the camp amplifier to broadcast a news and music radio station they named &quot;Station KRGY&quot;, short for &quot;Kriegsgefangener&quot; (POWs) and also published two newspapers, the &quot;Circuit&quot; and the &quot;Kriegie Times&quot;, which were issued four times a week.

POWs operated a system whereby newcomers to the camp were vetted, to prevent German agents from infiltrating them. Any POW who could not be vouched for by two POWs who knew the prisoner by sight was severely interrogated and afterwards escorted continually by other prisoners, until such time as he was deemed to be a genuine Allied POW. Several infiltrators were discovered by this method and none is known to have escaped detection in Luft III.

The German guards were referred to by POWs as &quot;goons&quot; and, unaware of the Allied connotation, willingly accepted the nickname after being told it stood for &quot;German Officer Or Non-Com&quot;. German guards were followed everywhere they went by prisoners, who used an elaborate system of signals to warn others of their location. The guards&#x27; movements were then carefully recorded in a logbook kept by a rota of officers. Unable to stop what the prisoners called the &quot;Duty Pilot&quot; system, the Germans allowed it to continue and on one occasion the book was used by &quot;Kommandant&quot; Lindeiner to bring charges against two guards who had slunk away from duty several hours early.

The camp&#x27;s 800 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; guards were either too old for combat duty or young men convalescing after long tours of duty or from wounds. Because the guards were &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; personnel, the prisoners were accorded far better treatment than that granted to other POWs in Germany. Deputy Commandant Major Gustav Simoleit, a professor of history, geography and ethnology before the war, spoke several languages, including English, Russian, Polish and Czech. Transferred to Sagan in early 1943, he proved sympathetic to Allied airmen. Ignoring the ban against extending military courtesies to POWs, he provided full military honours for Luft III POW funerals, including one for a Jewish airman.

Food was always a matter of concern for the POWs. The recommended daily dietary intake for a normal healthy inactive adult male is . Luft III issued &quot;non-working&quot; German civilian rations which allowed per day, with the balance made up from American, Canadian and British Red Cross parcels and items sent to the POWs by their families. As was customary at most camps, Red Cross and individual parcels were pooled and distributed to the men equally. The camp also had an official internal bartering system called a &quot;Foodacco&quot; – POWs marketed surplus goods for &quot;points&quot; that could be &quot;spent&quot; on other items. The Germans paid captured officers the equivalent of their pay in internal camp currency (&quot;Lagergeld&quot;), which was used to buy what goods were made available by the German administration. Every three months, weak beer was made available in the canteen for sale. As non-commissioned officers (NCOs) did not receive any &quot;pay&quot; it was the usual practice in camps for the officers to provide one-third for their use but at Luft III all &quot;Lagergeld&quot; was pooled for communal purchases. As British government policy was to deduct camp pay from the prisoners&#x27; military pay, the communal pool avoided the practice in other camps whereby American officers contributed to British canteen purchases.

Stalag Luft III had the best-organised recreational program of any POW camp in Germany. Each compound had athletic fields and volleyball courts. The prisoners participated in basketball, softball, boxing, touch football, volleyball, table tennis and fencing, with leagues organised for most. A pool used to store water for firefighting, was occasionally available for swimming.

As described by J. Frank Diggs, many amenities were made possible by Swedish lawyer Henry Söderberg, who was the YMCA representative to the area and frequently brought to its camps sports equipment, religious items supporting the work of chaplains, the wherewithal for each camp&#x27;s band and orchestra and well-equipped library.

===Stalag Luft III radio transmitter===
Specialist observers from the Telecommunications Research Establishment volunteered to fly on bombing missions to make radio and radar observations. Observers received RAF commissions in case they were lost or captured on operations so that their presence would not be questioned. Howard Cundall, RAF, had volunteered for a night bombing mission, during which Cundall would make observations over France. Cundall and all crew were forced to bail out in the early hours of 4 November 1941. All of the crew survived and were captured except for the second pilot, who escaped unnoticed to Spain. The Germans were unaware that Cundall was an additional, non-standard crew member and that the second pilot was missing. They believed that they had captured every member of a standard bomber crew. Cundall&#x27;s specialized knowledge of British radar would have made him a potentially valuable source of information for the Germans. Due to the Germans&#x27; belief that they had captured a standard bomber crew, they did not suspect the true nature of Cundall&#x27;s duties. While in Stalag Luft III, Cundall concealed his knowledge of new radar devices. He also built a radio transmitter with which he opened contact between the camp and London, maintaining the transmitter even during the final westward marches in 1945 as the Germans consolidated POW camps in the late stages of the war. In this way he provided information from captured air crews regarding their experiences with the German night defenses, helping the bombing offensive from within the camp.

===US covert assistance to Stalag Luft III===
Having been informed of the necessity and methods via similar British programmes, there were secret efforts to train American aircrews in secret letter writing home from the POW Camps. In the US, these were MIS-X and P.O. Box 1142 run out of Fort Hunt in Virginia, as well as a secret programme of sending escape aids into camps disguised inside care packages from two covert relief agencies. These went to American prisoners in many camps, including Stalag Luft III. The American POWs in Stalag Luft III were moved weeks prior to the &#x27;Great Escape&#x27; attempt and were not able to participate.

===Escape and evasion programme===
Even more secret than the strategic interrogation programme was Fort Hunt&#x27;s escape and evasion (E&amp;E) program (MIS_X). Even the fort&#x27;s commandant was unaware of this mission to prepare US servicemen to evade capture and, if captured, to escape, modelled on the British programme. One mission of the E&amp;E programme was to create maps of areas where bombers were going so downed airmen could use them to find their way back. Silk maps created at P.O. Box 1142 were distributed to the Air Force, and five million uniform buttons were created containing hidden compasses. For five months prior to the escape of March 1944, MIS-X had been sending escape aids to the camp.

==First escape (1943)==
The first escape occurred in October 1943 in the East Compound. Conjuring up a modern Trojan Horse, &quot;kriegies&quot; (prisoners) constructed a gymnastic vaulting horse largely from plywood from Red Cross parcels. The horse was designed to conceal men, tools and containers of soil. Each day the horse was carried out to the same spot near the perimeter fence and while prisoners conducted gymnastic exercises above, a tunnel was dug. At the end of each day, a wooden board was placed over the tunnel entrance and covered with surface soil. The gymnastics disguised the real purpose of the vaulting horse and kept the sound of the digging from being detected by the microphones. For three months Lieutenant Michael Codner, Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams and Flight Lieutenant Oliver Philpot, in shifts of one or two diggers at a time, dug over of tunnel, using bowls as shovels and metal rods to poke through the surface of the ground to create air holes. No shoring was used except near the entrance. On the evening of 19 October 1943, Codner, Williams and Philpot made their escape. Williams and Codner were able to reach the port of Stettin where they stowed away on a Danish ship and eventually returned to Britain. Philpot, posing as a Norwegian margarine manufacturer, was able to board a train to Danzig (now Gdańsk) and from there stowed away on a Swedish ship headed for Stockholm, from where he was repatriated to Britain. Accounts of this escape were recorded in the book &quot;Goon in the Block&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;) by Williams, the book &quot;Stolen Journey&quot; by Philpot and the 1950 film &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;.

==The &quot;Great Escape&quot; (1944)==
===Background===

In March 1943, Squadron Leader Roger Bushell conceived a plan for a mass escape from the North Compound, which took place on the night of 24/25 March 1944. He was being held with the other British and Commonwealth airmen and ran the Escape Committee that managed all escape opportunities from the north compound. Falling back on his legal background to represent his scheme, Bushell called a meeting of the Escape Committee to advocate his plan.

Group Captain Herbert Massey, as senior British officer, authorised the escape attempt which would have good chance of success; in fact, the simultaneous digging of three tunnels would become an advantage if any one of them was discovered, because the guards would scarcely imagine that another two were well under way. The most radical aspect of the plan was not the scale of the construction, but the number of men intended to pass through the tunnels. While previous attempts had involved up to 20 men, in this case Bushell was proposing to get over 200 out, all wearing civilian clothes and some with forged papers and escape equipment. As this escape attempt was unprecedented in size, it would require unparalleled organisation. As the mastermind of the Great Escape, Roger Bushell inherited the codename of &quot;Big X&quot;. More than 600 prisoners were involved in the construction of the tunnels.

===Tunnels===

Three tunnels, &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot;, were dug for the escape. The operation was so secretive that everyone was to refer to each tunnel by its name. Bushell took this so seriously that he threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word &quot;tunnel&quot;. &quot;Tom&quot; began in a darkened corner next to a stove chimney in hut 123 and extended west into the forest. It was found by the Germans and dynamited. &quot;Dick&quot;&#x27;s entrance was hidden in a drain sump in the wash room of hut 122 and had the most secure trap door. It was to go in the same direction as &quot;Tom&quot; and the prisoners decided that the hut would not be a suspected tunnel site as it was further from the wire than the others. &quot;Dick&quot; was abandoned for escape purposes because the area where it would have surfaced was cleared for camp expansion. &quot;Dick&quot; was used to store soil and supplies and as a workshop.

&quot;Harry&quot;, which began in hut 104, went under the &quot;Vorlager&quot; (which contained the German administration area), sick hut and the isolation cells to emerge at the woods on the northern edge of the camp. The entrance to &quot;Harry&quot; was hidden under a stove. Ultimately used for the escape, it was discovered as the escape was in progress with only 76 of the planned 220 prisoners free. The Germans filled it with sewage and sand and sealed it with cement. After the escape, the prisoners started digging another tunnel called &quot;George&quot;, but this was abandoned when the camp was evacuated.

===Tunnel construction===
The tunnels were very deep – about below the surface. They were very small, only square, though larger chambers were dug to house an air pump, a workshop and staging posts along each tunnel. The sandy walls were shored up with pieces of wood scavenged from all over the camp, much from the prisoners&#x27; beds (of the twenty or so boards originally supporting each mattress, only about eight were left on each bed). Other wooden furniture was also scavenged.


Other materials were also used, such as Klim tin cans that had held powdered milk supplied by the Red Cross for the prisoners. The metal in the cans could be fashioned into various tools and items such as scoops and lamps, the latter fuelled by fat skimmed off soup served at the camp and collected in tiny tin vessels, with wicks made from worn clothing. The main use of the Klim tins was for the extensive ventilation ducting in all three tunnels.

As the tunnels grew longer, a number of technical innovations made the job easier and safer. A pump was built to push fresh air along the ducting, invented by Squadron Leader Bob Nelson of 37 Squadron. The pumps were built of odd items including pieces from the beds, hockey sticks and knapsacks, as well as the Klim tins.

The usual method of disposing of sand from all the digging was to scatter it discreetly on the surface. Small pouches made of towels or long underpants were attached inside the prisoners&#x27; trousers; as they walked around, the sand could be scattered. Sometimes, they would dump sand into the small gardens they were allowed to tend. As one prisoner turned the soil, another would release sand while they both appeared to be in conversation. The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges from the sand, and were referred to as &quot;penguins&quot; because of their supposed resemblance. In sunny months, sand could be carried outside and scattered in blankets used for sun bathing; more than 200 were used to make an estimated 25,000 trips.

The Germans were aware that something was going on but failed to discover any of the tunnels until much later. To break up an escape attempt, nineteen of the top suspects were transferred without warning to Stalag VIIIC. Of those, only six had been involved with tunnel construction. One of these, a Canadian named Wally Floody, was actually originally in charge of digging and camouflage before his transfer.

Eventually the prisoners felt they could no longer dump sand above ground because the Germans became too efficient at catching them doing it. After &quot;Dick&#x27;s&quot; planned exit point was covered by a new camp expansion, the decision was made to start filling it up. As the tunnel&#x27;s entrance was very well hidden, &quot;Dick&quot; was also used as a storage room for items such as maps, postage stamps, forged travel permits, compasses, and clothing. Some guards cooperated by supplying railway timetables, maps and many official papers so that they could be forged. Some genuine civilian clothes were obtained by bribing German staff with cigarettes, coffee or chocolate. These were used by escaping prisoners to travel from the camp more easily, especially by train.

The prisoners ran out of places to hide sand, and snow cover made it impractical to scatter it undetected. Under the seats in the theatre there was a large empty space, but when it was built the prisoners had given their word not to misuse the materials; the parole system was regarded as inviolate. Internal &quot;legal advice&quot; was taken and the senior British officers (&quot;SBOs&quot;) decided that the completed building did not fall under the parole system. A seat in the back row was hinged and the sand-dispersal problem was solved.

German prison camps began to receive larger numbers of American prisoners. The Germans decided that new camps would be built specifically for US airmen. To allow as many people to escape as possible, including the Americans, efforts on the remaining two tunnels increased. This drew attention from guards and in September 1943 the entrance to &quot;Tom&quot; became the 98th tunnel to be discovered in the camp; guards in the woods had seen sand being removed from the hut where it was located. Work on &quot;Harry&quot; ceased and did not resume until January 1944.

===Tunnel &quot;Harry&quot; completed===
&quot;Harry&quot; was finally ready in March 1944. By then the Americans, some of whom had worked on &quot;Tom&quot;, had been moved away; despite the portrayal of three in the Hollywood film, only one American, Major Johnnie Dodge, participated in the &quot;Great Escape&quot;, and he had become a British citizen. Previously, the attempt had been planned for the summer for its good weather, but in early 1944 the Gestapo visited the camp and ordered increased effort to detect escapes. Rather than risk waiting and having their tunnel discovered, Bushell ordered the attempt be made as soon as it was ready. Many Germans willingly helped in the escape itself. The film suggests that the forgers were able to make near-exact replicas of just about any pass that was used in Nazi Germany. In reality, the forgers received a great deal of assistance from Germans who lived many hundreds of miles away on the other side of the country. Several German guards, who were openly anti-Nazi, also willingly gave the prisoners items and assistance of any kind to aid their escape.

In their plan, of the 600 who had worked on the tunnels only 200 would be able to escape. The prisoners were separated into two groups. The first group of 100, called &quot;serial offenders&quot;, were guaranteed a place and included 30 who spoke German well or had a history of escapes, and an additional 70 considered to have put in the most work on the tunnels. The second group, considered to have much less chance of success, was chosen by drawing lots; called &quot;hard-arsers&quot;, they would have to travel by night as they spoke little or no German and were only equipped with the most basic fake papers and equipment.

The prisoners waited about a week for a moonless night, and on Friday 24 March, the escape attempt began. As night fell, those allocated a place moved to Hut 104. Unfortunately for the prisoners, the exit trap door of Harry was frozen solid and freeing it delayed the escape for an hour and a half. Then it was discovered that the tunnel had come up short of the nearby forest; at 10.30 p.m. the first man out emerged just short of the tree line close to a guard tower. (According to Alan Burgess, in his book &quot;The Longest Tunnel,&quot; the tunnel reached the forest, as planned, but the first few trees were too sparse to provide adequate cover). As the temperature was below freezing and there was snow on the ground, a dark trail would be created by crawling to cover. To avoid being seen by the sentries, the escapes were reduced to about ten per hour, rather than the one every minute that had been planned. Word was eventually sent back that no one issued with a number above 100 would be able to escape before daylight. As they would be shot if caught trying to return to their own barracks, these men changed back into their own uniforms and got some sleep. An air raid then caused the camp&#x27;s (and the tunnel&#x27;s) electric lighting to be shut down, slowing the escape even more. At around 1 a.m., the tunnel collapsed and had to be repaired.

Despite these problems, 76 men crawled through to freedom, until at 4:55 a.m. on 25 March, the 77th man was spotted emerging by one of the guards. Those already in the trees began running, while New Zealand Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent VC who had just reached the tree line stood up and surrendered. The guards had no idea where the tunnel entrance was, so they began searching the huts, giving men time to burn their fake papers. Hut 104 was one of the last to be searched, and despite using dogs the guards were unable to find the entrance. Finally, German guard Charlie Pilz crawled back through the tunnel but found himself trapped at the camp end; he began calling for help and the prisoners opened the entrance to let him out, finally revealing its location.

An early problem for the escapees was that most were unable to find the way into the railway station, until daylight revealed it was in a recess of the side wall to an underground pedestrian tunnel. Consequently, many of them missed their night time trains, and decided either to walk across country or wait on the platform in daylight. Another unanticipated problem was that March 1944 was the coldest March in the region for thirty years, with snow up to deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.

===Murders of escapees===


Following the escape, the Germans made an inventory of the camp and uncovered how extensive the operation had been. Four thousand bed boards had gone missing, as well as 90 complete double bunk beds, 635 mattresses, 192 bed covers, 161 pillow cases, 52 twenty-man tables, 10 single tables, 34 chairs, 76 benches, 1,212 bed bolsters, 1,370 beading battens, 1,219 knives, 478 spoons, 582 forks, 69 lamps, 246 water cans, 30 shovels, of electric wire, of rope, and 3,424 towels. 1,700 blankets had been used, along with more than 1,400 Klim cans. Electric cable had been stolen after being left unattended by German workers; because they had not reported the theft, they were executed by the Gestapo. Thereafter each bed was supplied with only nine bed boards, which were counted regularly by the guards.

Of 76 escapees, 73 were captured. Adolf Hitler initially wanted every recaptured officer to be shot. Hermann Göring, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Major-General Westhoff and Major-General Hans von Graevenitz (inspector in charge of war prisoners) pointed out to Hitler that a massacre might bring about reprisals to German pilots in Allied hands. Hitler agreed, but insisted &quot;more than half&quot; were to be shot, eventually ordering SS head Heinrich Himmler to execute more than half of the escapees. Himmler passed the selection on to General Arthur Nebe, and fifty were executed singly or in pairs. Roger Bushell, the leader of the escape, was shot by Gestapo official Emil Schulz just outside what is today Ramstein Air Base near Kaiserslautern, Germany. Bob Nelson is said to have been spared by the Gestapo because they may have believed he was related to his namesake Admiral Nelson. His friend Dick Churchill was probably spared because of his surname, shared with the British Prime Minister.

Seventeen captured escapees were returned to &quot;Stalag Luft III.&quot;

Two captured escapees were sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, and four (Harry Day, Sydney Dowse, Bertram James, and Johnnie Dodge) were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where one quipped &quot;the only way out of here is up the chimney.&quot; They managed to tunnel out and escape three months later, although they were recaptured and returned;

There were three successful escapees:
* Per Bergsland, Norwegian pilot of No. 332 Squadron RAF, escapee #44
* Jens Müller, Norwegian pilot of No. 331 Squadron RAF, escapee #43
* Bram van der Stok, Dutch pilot of No. 41 Squadron RAF, escapee #18

Bergsland and Müller escaped together, and reached neutral Sweden by train and boat with the help of friendly Swedish sailors. Van der Stok, granted one of the first slots by the Escape Committee owing to his language and escape skills, travelled through much of occupied Europe with the help of the French Resistance before finding safety at a British consulate in Spain.

===Aftermath===
The Gestapo investigated the escape and, while this uncovered no significant new information, the camp commandant, Friedrich Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was removed and threatened with court martial. Having feigned mental illness to avoid imprisonment, he was later wounded by Soviet troops advancing toward Berlin while acting as second in command of an infantry unit. He surrendered to British forces as the war ended, and was a prisoner of war for two years at the prisoner of war camp known as the &quot;London Cage&quot;. He testified during the British Special Investigation Branch (SIB) investigation concerning the Stalag Luft III murders. Originally one of Göring&#x27;s personal staff, after being refused retirement, Lindeiner had been posted as Sagan commandant. He had followed the Geneva Accords concerning the treatment of POWs and had won the respect of the senior prisoners. He was repatriated in 1947 and died in 1963 aged 82.

On 6 April 1944, the new camp &quot;commandant&quot; &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Erich Cordes informed Massey that he had received official communication from the German High Command that 41 of the escapees had been shot while resisting arrest. Massey was himself repatriated on health grounds a few days later.

Over subsequent days, prisoners collated the names of 47 prisoners they considered to be unaccounted for. On 15 April (17 April in some sources. The Red Cross paid a visit to the camp on 22 May 1944. The previous visit had taken place on 26 July 1943) the new senior British officer, Group Captain Douglas Wilson (RAAF), surreptitiously passed a list of these names to an official visitor from the Swiss Red Cross.

Cordes was replaced soon afterwards by &quot;Oberst&quot; Werner Braune. Braune was appalled that so many escapees had been killed, and allowed the prisoners who remained there to build a memorial, to which he also contributed—the memorial still stands at its original site.

The British government learned of the deaths from a routine visit to the camp by Swiss authorities as the protecting power in May. The Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden announced the news to the House of Commons on 19 May 1944. Shortly afterwards, the repatriated Massey arrived in Britain and briefed the government regarding the fate of the escapees. Eden updated Parliament on 23 June, promising that, at the end of the war, those responsible would be brought to exemplary justice.

===Postwar investigation and prosecutions===
General Arthur Nebe, who is believed to have selected the airmen to be shot, was involved in the 20 July plot to kill Hitler and was executed by Nazi authorities in 1945.

After the war ended, Wg Cdr. Wilfred Bowes of the RAF Police Special Investigation Branch (SIB) began to research the Great Escape and launched a manhunt for German personnel considered responsible for killing escapees. As a result, several former Gestapo and military personnel were convicted of war crimes.

Colonel Telford Taylor was the US prosecutor in the German High Command case at the Nuremberg Trials. The indictment called for the General Staff of the Army and the High Command of the German Armed Forces to be considered criminal organisations; the witnesses were several of the surviving German field marshals and their staff officers. One of the crimes charged was of the murder of the fifty. Colonel of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Bernd von Brauchitsch, who served on the staff of Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, was interrogated by Captain Horace Hahn about the murders. Several Gestapo officers responsible for the murders were executed or imprisoned.

In 1964, the West German government agreed to provide a million pounds as compensation to British victims of Nazism, which included survivors of the escape from Stalag Luft III. However, many former British POWs, including many of those who had been imprisoned at Stalag Luft III, had their claims rejected, leading to the political controversy known as the &quot;Sachsenhausen Affair&quot; in 1967.

===Survivors===
*Squadron Leader BA &quot;Jimmy&quot; James MC, RAF was shot down over the Netherlands on 5 June 1940, and subsequently was involved in 13 escape efforts from various camps and prisons, including the &#x27;Great Escape&#x27; and the subsequent escape from Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He wrote an account of these escapes and his role in the building of the tunnels in his 1983 book &quot;Moonless Night&quot;. He was in charge of tunnel dispersal in the theatre. He died on 18 January 2008 aged 92.
*Flight Lieutenant Bernard &quot;Pop&quot; Green, RAF was one of the escapees who was captured by the Germans and sent back to Stalag Luft III. He survived the war and returned home to Buckinghamshire. He died November 2, 1971. Green was the oldest person to be involved in the escape, 56 years old and born in 1887. His grandson Lawrence Green wrote a book about him in 2012 entitled &quot;Great War to Great Escape: The Two Wars of Flight Lieutenant Bernard &#x27;Pop&#x27; Green MC&quot;.
* Flight Lieutenant Tony Bethell was an RAF officer who was shot down and captured in the Netherlands on 7 December 1942.  He was taken to Stalag Luft III and, aged 21, was the youngest man to escape through &#x27;Harry&#x27; tunnel on 24 March 1944. He was captured on 28 March and interrogated by the Gestapo before being returned to Stalag Luft III, where he spent his 22nd birthday (9 April 1944) in the cooler. He died at his home in Canada in 2004. In honour of her husband, Lorna Bethell donated $2,000,000 and organised fundraising that resulted in the opening of Bethell Hospice in 2010.
*Jack Harrison, who was one of the 200 men of the Great Escape, died on 4 June 2010, at the age of 97.
*Les Broderick, who kept watch over the entry of the &quot;Dick&quot; tunnel, died on 8 April 2013 aged 91. He was in a group of three who had escaped out of the &quot;Harry&quot; tunnel but were recaptured when a cottage they had hoped to rest in turned out to be full of soldiers.
*Ken Rees, a digger, was in the tunnel when the escape was discovered. He later lived in North Wales and died at age 93 on 30 August 2014. His book is called &quot;Lie in the Dark and Listen&quot;.
* Flying Officer Gordon King of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, had been number 141 to escape and operated the pump to send air into the tunnel. Speaking candidly of his high number and resulting inability to get out of the tunnel that night, he said he considered himself fortunate. King had been shot down over Germany in 1943 and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner. He participated in the &quot;Battle Scars&quot; television series in his home town of Edmonton. He died on July 16, 2020 at the age of 100.
*Jack Lyon, number 79 on the roster, celebrated his 100th birthday in 2017. He died on 12 March 2019, aged 101.
*Paul Royle, a Bristol Blenheim pilot, was interviewed in March 2014 as part of the 70th anniversary of the escape, living in Perth, Australia at the age of 100. He downplayed the significance of the escape and did not claim that he did anything extraordinary, saying: &quot;While we all hoped for the future we were lucky to get the future. We eventually defeated the Germans and that was that.&quot; Royle died, aged 101, in August 2015.
*Dick Churchill was the last surviving of the 76 escapees before his death on 15 February 2019; then an RAF squadron leader, he was among the 23 not executed by the Nazis. Churchill, a Handley Page Hampden bomber pilot, was discovered after the escape hiding in a hay loft. In a 2014 interview at the age of 94, he said he was fairly certain that he had been spared execution because his captors thought he might be related to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
* Charles Clarke was an RAF officer who served as a bomb aimer. After his Lancaster bomber crashed, he was captured and sent to Stalag Luft III, arriving weeks before the Great Escape. He did not take part in the escape itself, but had helped to forge papers and acted as a &quot;watcher&quot;. He later took part in the forced march before being liberated. He remained in the RAF after the war, reaching the rank of air commodore. He returned to the camp in later life and helped build a replica of Hut 104 (where the Great Escape tunnel started). He also retraced the forced march on each anniversary. He died on 7 May 2019.

==Liberation in 1945==
Just before midnight on 27 January 1945, with Soviet troops only away, the remaining 11,000 POWs were marched out of camp with the eventual destination of Spremberg. In freezing temperatures and of snow, 2,000 prisoners were assigned to clear the road ahead of the main group. After a march, the POWs arrived in Bad Muskau where they rested for 30 hours, before marching the remaining to Spremberg. On 31 January, the South Compound prisoners plus 200 men from the West Compound were sent by train to Stalag VII-A at Moosburg followed by the Centre compound prisoners on 7 February. Thirty-two prisoners escaped during the march to Moosburg but all were recaptured. The North, East and remaining West compound prisoners at Spremberg were sent either to Stalag XIII-D at Nuremberg on 2 February or to Marlag und Milag Nord at Westertimke.

With the approach of US forces on 13 April, the American prisoners at XIII-D were marched to Stalag VII-A. While the majority reached VII-A on 20 April, many had dropped out on the way with the German guards making no attempt to stop them. Built to hold 14,000 POWs, Stalag VII-A now held 130,000 from evacuated stalags with 500 living in barracks built for 200. Some chose to live in tents while others slept in air raid slit trenches. The US 14th Armored Division liberated the prisoners of VII-A on 29 April. Kenneth W. Simmons&#x27;s book &quot;Kriegie&quot; (1960) vividly describes the life of POWs in the American section of Stalag Luft III in the final months of the war, ending with the winter forced-march from the camp, ahead of the advancing Soviet troops and eventually being liberated.

==Notable prisoners==
Notable military personnel held at Stalag Luft III included:
* Fighter pilot Roland Beamont, later to fly the English Electric Canberra and English Electric Lightning as a test pilot, arrived at Stalag Luft III just after the &quot;Great Escape&quot;, having been shot down in his Hawker Tempest by ground fire, while attacking a troop train near Bocholt while on his 492nd operational sortie.
* Australian journalist Paul Brickhill was an inmate at Stalag Luft III from 1943 until release. In 1950 he wrote &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, the first comprehensive account of the breakout, which was later adapted into the film; and went on to chronicle the life of Douglas Bader in &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; and the efforts of 617 &quot;Dam Busters&quot; Squadron.
* Josef Bryks, Czechoslovak RAFVR fighter pilot and serial escaper, was held at Stalag Luft III from August 1943 to July 1944.
* Col Darr Alkire, Commander of the 449th Bombardment Group. The senior officer in charge of the West Compound from April 1944 to release in April 1945. Future Brigadier General and Silver Star recipient.
* Flying Officer Ray Grayston, RAF, one of the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; who had bombed the Eder Dam, was an inmate at Stalag Luft III from 1943 to 1945.
* Flight Lieutenant George Harsh of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was a member of the Great Escape&#x27;s executive committee and the camp &quot;security officer&quot;. He was one of the 19 &quot;suspects&quot; transferred to Belaria compound shortly before the escape. Born in 1910 to a wealthy and prominent family in the US state of Georgia, Harsh, a medical student, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1929 for the self-confessed thrill killing of a grocer. He saved the life of a fellow prisoner by performing an emergency appendectomy, for which Georgia governor Eugene Talmadge released him on parole in November 1940 and finally granted him a full pardon. He then joined the RCAF as a tail gunner and after being shot down in 1942 was sent to Stalag Luft III. In 1971 he published his autobiography which has since been translated into German and Russian.
* George J. Iles, US Army Air Forces officer and fighter pilot with the 332nd Fighter Group&#x27;s 99th Fighter Squadron (the Tuskegee Airmen or &quot;Red Tails) Transferred to Nuremberg-Langwasser, and finally to the 86-acre, multinational prisoner of war camp, Stalag VII-A, the largest POW camp in Nazi Germany.
* Lt Alexander Jefferson of the 332nd Fighter Group, the &quot;Red Tails&quot; of the Tuskegee Airmen based out of Ramitelli Airfield near Foggia, Italy. During his 19th mission over Toulon, southern France on 12 August 1944, while attacking a radar installation he was shot down. Parachuting to safety and landing within a forest, he was immediately captured by Nazi ground troops, and was interred at Stalag Luft III after the Great Escape. He was later transferred to Stalag VII-A, just outside Dachau. After the Russian Army entered Poland, the prisoners were marched to Munich by the Germans, where they were freed by General George Patton&#x27;s US Third Army.
* David M. Jones, Commander of the 319th Bombardment Group in North Africa, was an inmate at Stalag Luft III for two and a half years. According to his biography he led the digging team on &quot;Harry&quot;. In early 1942 Jones took part in the Doolittle raid on Japan undertaken in retaliation for the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.
* Squadron Leader Phil Lamason of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, who was also the senior officer in charge of 168 Allied airmen initially held at Buchenwald concentration camp.
* Fl Sgt Nathan &#x27;Nat&#x27; Leaman, an MiD escaper, attempted escape from Stalag Luft III, and was later transferred to Heydekrug. It is believed the &quot;scrounger&quot; character in the film played by James Garner is based on Nat. See article by Martin Sugarman of AJEX, on Jewish Virtual Library and JHSE web page under research articles.
* Squadron Leader Geoffrey Douglas Leyland, great-grandson of British shipping magnate Frederick Richards Leyland, was shot down over and captured in Holland in June 1942. He spent the remainder of the war in Stalag Luft III vetting incoming POWs.
* Major P. P. Kumaramangalam of the British Indian Army, a future Chief of the Indian Army.
* Flight Lieutenant Gordon &quot;Moose&quot; Miller RCAF, helped carry the Wooden Horse in and out each day under the German guns without faltering with the weight of two concealed diggers and a day&#x27;s worth of earth. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for repairing a damaged Vickers Wellington in flight and allowing the crew to parachute to safety.
* Robert M. Polich Sr., also of the United States Army Air Forces, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross; later featured in the short film &quot;Red Leader on Fire&quot; which was submitted for the Minnesota&#x27;s Greatest Generation short film festival in 2008.
* Col Delmar T. Spivey, who was, for a time, the senior American officer (&quot;SAO&quot;), was captured on 12 August 1943, while flying as an observer on a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the 407th Bomb Squadron, 92d Bomb Group. As the USAAF expert on aerial gunnery, Spivey was on the mission to evaluate possible improvements to gun turrets. Spivey assumed command as SAO, in Centre Compound, in August 1943. Amazed by the prisoners&#x27; ingenuity, he had a carefully coded history of the camp created, so that future POWs would not have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;. This carefully hidden record was retrieved and carried at no little risk when the camp was hastily evacuated in late January 1945 as the Germans marched the prisoners away from the rapidly advancing Soviet armies. The documents served as the basis and initial impetus for &quot;Stalag Luft III – The Secret Story&quot;, a definitive history of the camp, by Col Arthur A. Durand, USAF (Ret.).
* Wing Commander Robert Stanford Tuck, a British flying ace with 29 victories, was imprisoned at Sagan until shortly before the Great Escape; suspected of being a ringleader, he was transferred to Belaria, which Tuck credited with saving his life. (His mentor, Roger Bushell, was among those shot after the Great Escape.) Tuck eventually managed to escape on 1 February 1945, during the evacuation of the camp, with the help of Polish RAF pilot Zbigniew Kustrzyński. Both made it to the Soviet lines.
* Flight Lieutenant Wally Floody, a Canadian shot down flying his Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, was also imprisoned at Sagan until shortly before the Great Escape; he was one of the 19 transferred to Belaria. Floody had been put in charge of digging and camouflage by Roger Bushell. At the end of the war Floody gave evidence about conditions in POW camps at the Nuremberg trials. In early 1962, Floody received a phone call from film director John Sturges. Floody was told about a film Sturges was planning to make based on the book by Paul Brickhill, an Australian flyer who spent time at Stalag Luft III. Floody agreed to be technical adviser on the 1963 feature film &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. He is popularly considered the real-life counterpart to that film&#x27;s fictional &quot;tunnel king&quot;, Danny Velinski, played by Charles Bronson. After returning to civilian life, Floody became a businessman and co-founder of the Royal Canadian Air Force Prisoners of War Association. He died in Toronto, Ontario on 25 September 1989.
* Brigadier-General Arthur W. Vanaman, the highest-ranking USAAF officer captured in the European Theatre of Operations. Vanaman, an intelligence officer, succeeded Spivey as SAO in mid-1944. He, like Spivey, had been captured after flying as an observer on a bombing mission. The crew had advised Vanaman to bail out after his aircraft had been hit by flak and filled with smoke. This, ironically, had been caused by the ignition of a harmless smoke marker and the bomber had returned to base safely.
* Colonel Jerry M. Sage, the guerrilla leader and saboteur known as &quot;Silent Death&quot; and &quot;Cooler King&quot; who served in the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA) during World War II. He worked for fifteen months on the huge, three-tunnel project known in book and film as &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and was in charge of hiding over 200,000 pounds of golden sand from the German &quot;ferrets&quot;. In the 1960s, he served as commander of the US Army 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Bad Tölz in Bavaria.
* Peter Stevens, the only known German-Jewish bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force. Stevens (born Georg Franz Hein in Hanover) was a refugee living in London at the outbreak of hostilities, and assumed the identity of a dead London schoolmate in order to enlist. As the pilot of a Handley Page Hampden, he flew 22 combat operations before his plane was hit by flak over Berlin, and he force-landed (out of fuel) near Amsterdam on 8 September 1941. As a POW, he made nine escape attempts, and was one of only 69 members of the RAF to be awarded the Military Cross in World War II. Stevens was head of contacts (scrounging) for the &quot;X&quot; Organisation in East Compound of Stalag Luft III from 22 Apr 1943 until it was evacuated in late Jan 1945.
* Nicholas Alkemade, an English tail gunner in the Royal Air Force who survived a freefall of 18,000 feet (5,490 m).

Some held at Stalag Luft III went on to notable careers in the entertainment and sports industry:
* British actor Peter Butterworth and English writer Talbot Rothwell were both inmates; they became friends and later worked together on the &quot;Carry On&quot; films. Butterworth was one of the vaulters covering for the escapees during the escape portrayed by the book and film &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;. After the war and as an established actor, Butterworth auditioned but &quot;didn&#x27;t look convincingly heroic or athletic enough&quot; according to the makers of the film.
* British actor Rupert Davies had many roles in productions at the theatre in the camp; his most famous roles on film and TV may have been Inspector Maigret in the BBC series &quot;Maigret&quot; that aired over 52 episodes from 1960 to 1963 and George Smiley in the movie &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;.
* English writer and broadcaster Hugh Falkus was an inmate at Stalag Luft III from around 1943, after his Spitfire was shot down over France. Falkus reportedly worked on 13 escape tunnels during his time as a POW, although never officially listed as an escapee.
* American novelist and screenwriter Len Giovannitti was held in Stalag Luft III&#x27;s Center Compound. A navigator with the 742nd Bomb Squadron, 455th Bomb Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, he was on his 50th mission when his Consolidated B-24 Liberator was shot down over Austria on 26 June 1944. A POW for nearly a year, he incorporated his experiences, including the winter march to Germany and liberation in Bavaria, in his 1957 novel &quot;The Prisoners of Combine D&quot;.
* Caribbean/British barrister and entertainer Cy Grant, born in British Guiana, served as a Flight Lieutenant in the RAF and spent two years as a prisoner of war, including time at Stalag Luft III. After the war he qualified as a barrister but went on to be a singer, actor, and author. He was the first black person to be regularly seen on British television, singing the news as &quot;topical calypsos&quot; (punning on &quot;tropical&quot;) on the BBC &quot;Tonight&quot; programme.
* Wally Kinnan, one of the first well known US television broadcast meteorologists, was also in the camp.
* Canadian Major League Baseball pitcher Phil Marchildon spent nine months in the camp. He resumed his baseball career after the war, winning 19 games for the 1947 Philadelphia Athletics.
* American children&#x27;s television personality Ray Rayner was a prisoner in the camp.

Stalag Luft III inmates also became involved in politics:
* Justin O&#x27;Byrne, who spent more than three years as a POW, represented Tasmania in the Australian Senate for 34 years and served as President of the Senate.
* Professor Basil Chubb, author and political science lecturer, spent 15 months there after being shot down over Germany.
* Frederick Irving, later a US diplomat and civil servant.
* Charles W. Sandman Jr., a navigator in the USAAF, spent over seven months in Stalag Luft III. Sandman entered the camp weighing approximately and left weighing . In his diary, Sandman describes the harsh winters and struggles to secure rations sent by the American Red Cross. After the war, he was elected to the US House of Representatives from New Jersey and was criticised for supporting President Nixon during the Watergate scandal.
* Peter Thomas, later created Lord Thomas of Gwydir after a political career as a Welsh Conservative politician and UK cabinet minister under Edward Heath, spent four years as a prisoner of war including being imprisoned at Stalag Luft III.
*Anthony Barber, later Baron Barber, went on to become a British Conservative politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1970 to 1974.

==In popular culture==

Paul Brickhill was an Australian-born Spitfire pilot, shot down in 1943 over Tunisia to become a prisoner of war. While imprisoned at Stalag Luft III, he was involved in the escape attempt. He did not take part in tunnelling but was in charge of &quot;stooges&quot;, the relay teams who would alert prisoners that German search teams had entered the camp. He was originally scheduled to be an early escapee but when it was discovered he suffered from claustrophobia, he was dropped down to the bottom of the list. He later said that this probably saved his life. After the war, Brickhill co-wrote &quot;Escape to Danger&quot; with Conrad Norton in 1946. Following this, Brickhill wrote a larger study and the first major account of the escape, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, published in 1950. This book brought the camp and escape to wider public attention and was the basis of the eponymous film, released in 1963. The film had numerous factual compromises to amplify its commercial appeal, such as including Americans among the escapees (none of whom were actually American). While some characters were fictitious, many were based on, or amalgams of, real people. There were no actual escapes by motorcycle or aircraft; the film sequence involving an escape in a German trainer aircraft may have been inspired by Bob Hoover&#x27;s escape from Stalag Luft I in a . Additionally, the recaptured prisoners were not executed in one place at the same time. The film popularized the story and memory of the fifty executed airmen despite its inaccuracies. The POW camp was actually officially referred to as &quot;Stalag Luft 3&quot; by the Germans in their documentation and on the ID tags issued to inmates, and Paul Brickhill, in his early writings about the escape, also wrote it that way. For &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, Brickhill&#x27;s English editors changed the name to be formatted as &quot;Stalag Luft III&quot;. The influence of &quot;The Great Escape&quot; on popular culture has resulted in the camp&#x27;s name continuing to be formatted as &quot;Stalag Luft III&quot;.

Eric Williams was a navigator on a downed bomber who was held at Stalag Luft III. After the war, on the long sea voyage home, Williams wrote &quot;Goon in the Block&quot;, a short book based on his experience. Four years later, in 1949, he rewrote it as a longer third-person narrative under the title &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;, which was filmed as &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; in 1950. He included many details omitted in his first book, but changed his name to &quot;Peter Howard&quot;, Michael Codner to &quot;John Clinton&quot; and Oliver Philpot to &quot;Philip Rowe&quot;. Williams also wrote a prequel, &quot;The Tunnel&quot;, an extended study of the mentalities of life as a prisoner of war. Although not an escape novel, it shows the profound urge to escape, and explores the ways that camp life affected men&#x27;s emotions.

In a possible homage to the real Stalag Luft III prisoner Howard Cundall, the fictional American Staff Sergeant Kinchloe of the 1960s&#x27; American TV parody &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; operates a clandestine radio transmitter and receiver from a POW camp (&quot;Stalag 13&quot;). Kinchloe is able to use his radio equipment to contact London, as Howard Cundall did.

The search for those responsible for the murder of the Allied officers, and the subsequent trials, was depicted in a 1988 television film named &quot;The Great Escape II: The Untold Story&quot;. The murder of the prisoners in this film is more accurate than in the 1963 original, with the POWs being shot individually or in pairs but other portions of the film are fictional.

The camp was the basis for a single-player mission and multi-player map in the first &quot;Call of Duty&quot; video game. Most of the buildings and guard towers were identical to the camp and the single-player mission involved rescuing a British officer from a prison cell that closely resembled the camp&#x27;s solitary confinement building. Stalag Luft is also a playable POW camp in the computer and Xbox game &quot;The Escapists&quot;, but with a slightly different name of &quot;Stalag Flucht&quot;.

&quot;The Great Escape&quot; is a video game which shares a title and similar plot to the movie. for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer published by Ocean Software in 1986, and later ported for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and DOS computers. The game surroundings were similar to the actual camp but the supposed location was in Northern Germany, and one side of the camp overlooked the North Sea. The Spectrum version of &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was placed at number 23 in the Your Sinclair official top 100,

&quot;The Great Escape&quot; also was a game for Xbox and PlayStation 2 released in 2003. The plot-line follows that of the 1963 film, except there are also levels featuring some of the character&#x27;s first captures and early escape attempts, as well as a changed ending.

A DVD of a 1983 reunion held in Chicago includes a reenactment of an interrogation between Hanns Scharff, master &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; interrogator known for his subtle approach, and American flying ace Francis Gabreski. This segment is hosted by Ray Tolliver, author of The Interrogator. Also included are short interviews with some of the former POWs.

The Apple TV miniseries Masters of the Air features Stalag Luft III in its later episodes; Majors Gale &quot;Buck&quot; Cleven and John &quot;Bucky&quot; Egan and others from the 100th Bomb Group were prisoners at the camp following the disastrous Bremen and Münster raids of October 1943, until its eventual closure.

<text>John Thomas Chambers (born August 23, 1949) is the former executive chairman and CEO of Cisco Systems.

==Early life==

Chambers was born on August 23, 1949, in Cleveland, Ohio to John Tuner &quot;Jack&quot; and June Chambers. His mother was a psychiatrist and his father was an obstetrician. The family resided in Kanawha City, Charleston.

When Chambers was nine years old, he was diagnosed with dyslexia. Aided by a therapist, Chambers learned to cope with his disability.

==Education==
He holds a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degree in business and a Juris Doctor from West Virginia University and a master of business administration from Kelley School of Business. Previously, he also attended the Edmund T. Pratt Jr. School of Engineering from 1967 to 1968.

==Career==
After obtaining his MBA, Chambers began his career in technology sales at IBM 1976–1983 when he was 27 years old. At 34 years old, in 1983, Chambers joined Wang Laboratories, later becoming Vice President of US Operations in 1987. During Chambers&#x27; time at the company, Wang&#x27;s profits declined dramatically from $2 billion 1989 to a $700 million loss in 1990. A year later, Chambers left Wang to join Cisco, which had gone public on February 16, 1990.

In 1995 Chambers became CEO of Cisco, a position he held until 2015. He had also been promoted to board chairman in 2006. During his tenure as CEO, the company&#x27;s annual sales grew from $1.9 billion to $49.2 billion. On July 27, 2015, Chuck Robbins replaced Chambers as CEO of Cisco Systems. Following his tenure as CEO, Chambers remained on the board until 2017, when he retired from the company. In October 2016, he was reported to own over 1.7 million Cisco shares worth approximately US$54 million. He holds the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus but holds no authority within the company.

In early 2021, Chambers became a member of the board of directors of Quantum Metric, a software company based in Colorado Springs.

John Chambers is chairman of the Board of Pensando. Chambers served on the board of directors of myCFO.

==Personal==
Chambers and his wife Elaine have two children, Lindsay and John.

==Political contributions==
Chambers has made political donations totaling over $180,000 to the Democratic Party and over $1,000,000 to the Republican Party. He served as a co-chair in Republican John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential bid.

Since 2010, Chambers has also served as a commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.

<doc id="1182599" wikidata="Q6005104" url="?curid=1182599" title="Immigration history of Australia">
<text>The immigration history of Australia began with the initial human migration to the continent around 80,000 years ago when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent via the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia and New Guinea. From the early 17th century onwards, the continent experienced the first coastal landings and exploration by European explorers. Permanent European settlement began in 1788 with the establishment of a British penal colony in New South Wales. From early federation in 1901, Australia maintained the White Australia Policy, which was abolished after World War II, heralding the modern era of multiculturalism in Australia. From the late 1970s there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries.

Australia is also a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and recognises the right of asylum.

== Original inhabitants ==

The first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present Indigenous people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 43,000 years Before Present (BP), while the upper range supported by others is 60,000 to 70,000 years BP.

In any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100–150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.

It is theorised that these original peoples first navigated the shorter distances from and between the Sunda Islands to reach Sahul; then via the land bridge to spread out through the continent. Archaeological evidence indicates human habitation at the upper Swan River, Western Australia by about 40,000 years ago; Tasmania (also at that time connected via a land bridge) was reached at least 30,000 years ago.

The ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversify and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10,000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Peninsula.

Several thousand years ago the Melanesian Torres Strait Islander peoples were established in the Torres Strait Islands, and commerce and contact was continued via this route although there is little evidence to suggest immediate influences extended much further south. A more sporadic contact along the northern Australian coast was maintained by seafarers across the Timor and Arafat Seas, with substantial evidence of Macassan contact with Australia in the centuries prior to European arrival, and also evidence of earlier contacts and exchanges by other groups. However, these exchanges do not appear to have involved any extended settlement or migrations of non-Aboriginal peoples to the region.

According to a 2013 German study by a team of researchers on Indigenous Australian DNA genes reveal that a wave of migrants from India arrived in Australia about 4,230 years ago. It shows that the Indian migrants settled in Australia before Captain James Cook&#x27;s first recorded contact with the Australian coastline. The study also suggests that up to 11 per cent of Aboriginal Australians DNA derives from Indians. During the migration period, dingos first appeared in the fossil suggests that the Indians took their dingos with them and they may also have brought stone tools called microliths. This study overturns the view that Australian continent was isolated from the time it was first colonised about 45,000–50,000 years ago until Europeans discovered Australia in the eighteenth century. Doctor Mark Stoneking, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had explained that the DNA link could have been by people actually moving, physically travelling from India directly to Australia, or their genetic material could have moved in terms of contact between India and neighbouring populations who then had contact with other neighbour populations and eventually, there would have been contact with Australia. Professor Alan Cooper, from the University of Adelaide&#x27;s Centre for Ancient DNA, says that the Indian influence may well have played a role in the development of the Australian Aboriginal culture. It has taken a while for the Indian influence to be discovered because Indigenous Australians have been hesitant to participate in these kinds of genetic studies.

== British colonisation and settlement: 1787–1850s ==
After the loss of the United States, Britain experienced overcrowding of its prisons and sought to ease the problems by transportation of its prisoners. In 1787 the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 1350 people under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip sailed for Australia. On 26 January 1788 a landing was made at Sydney Cove. The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony of New South Wales on 7 February. Other transport fleets bringing further convicts as well as free settlers to the colony followed. As a result of agitation by the free settlers in Sydney, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840. It continued to the colonies of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (where settlement began in 1803) and Moreton Bay (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for some years longer. The small settlement of Perth, founded in 1829 on the Swan River in Western Australia by free settlers, failed to prosper and asked for convicts. In contrast, South Australia, with its capital Adelaide founded in 1836, and Victoria, with its capital Melbourne founded in 1839, were settled only by free settlers. South Australia not only received British migrants, but also a significant influx of Prussian farmers and tradesmen, initially seeking freedom from religious persecution. By the end of the penal transportation in 1868, approximately 165,000 people had entered Australia as convicts.

From about 1815 Sydney began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived from Britain and Ireland and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free land. Many settlers occupied land without authority; they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class.

==Gold rushes==
The discovery of gold, beginning in 1851 first near Bathurst in New South Wales and then in the newly formed colony of Victoria, transformed Australia economically, politically and demographically. The gold rushes occurred hard on the heels of a major worldwide economic depression. As a result, about two per cent of the population of the British Isles emigrated to New South Wales and Victoria during the 1850s. There were also a significant number of continental Europeans, North Americans and Chinese.

In 1851 the Australian population was 437,655, of which 77,345, or just under 18%, were Victorians. A decade later the Australian population had grown to 1,151,947 and the Victorian population had increased to 538,628; just under 47% of the Australian total and a sevenfold increase. The rapid growth was predominantly a result of the gold rushes.

During the later half of the 19th century, several colonies funded the immigration of skilled immigrants from Europe, starting with the assistance of German vintners to South Australia. The government found that if it wanted immigrants it had to subsidise migration; the great distance from Europe made Australia a more expensive and less practical destination than Canada, the United States, Brazil or Argentina.

The number of immigrants needed during different stages of the economic cycle could be controlled by varying the subsidy. Before federation in 1901, assisted migrants received passage assistance from colonial government funds; the British government paid for the passage of convicts, paupers, the military and civil servants. Few immigrants received colonial government assistance before 1831. In Queensland many immigrants passed through the Yungaba Immigration Centre in Brisbane. The facility was built shortly after a period when immigration had been at an all-time high.
== Early federation: 1901–1945 ==
One of the motives for creating a federated Australia was the need for a common immigration policy. There was much resistance to Chinese immigration and the use of indentured workers from New Caledonia to work in the Queensland sugar industry.

The White Australia policy involved the exclusion of all non-European people from immigrating into Australia, and was the official policy of all governments and all mainstream political parties in Australia from the 1890s to the 1950s, and elements of the policy survived until the 1970s. Although the expression &#x27;White Australia policy&#x27; was never in official use, it was common in political and public debate throughout the period.

By 1938, many Jews were seeking to leave Germany and Austria due to the Nazi policy of Judenrein, the forced removal of Jews. In June 1938 at the Evian Conference was held in France to discuss the Jewish refugee crisis by which time there were hundreds of thousands of Jewish seeking to immigrate. Although many nations attended the conference and expressed their concerns for the refugees, No progress was made towards re-settlement of the refugees. Australia agreed to accept 15,000 Jewish refugees over three years with Australia&#x27;s delegate, Tomas W. White saying &quot;As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one.&quot;

A predominantly European nation on the periphery of Asia, historically many white citizens of Australia feared being demographically overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to the north. Following the attacks on Darwin and the associated fear of Imperial Japanese invasion in WWII, Minister of Immigration Arthur Calwell stated in 1947: &quot;We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.&quot; This concern about Australia&#x27;s demographic vulnerability was a driving force behind the country&#x27;s massive post-war program of European immigration.

== Post-war immigration ==

After World War II, Australia believed that it must increase its population to avoid the threat of another invasion and launched an immigration program whose goal was to increase Australia&#x27;s population with the slogan &quot;populate or perish&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans immigrated to Australia with more than three million people immigrating from Europe during the late 1940s until the 1960s. The Immigration Minister, Arthur Calwell, introduced the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme in 1945. The government was still trying to increase Australia&#x27;s population, especially with people who have skills in the secondary industry sector. As the world was transforming into a more industrial and technological world, Australia needed to keep up.

Australia looked first to Britain for migrants. In the beginning the assisted immigration scheme was popular among young married couples and single people. It was inexpensive, an adventure and an opportunity. After only a year, however, there was a shortage of ships and numbers dropped. The immigration targets were not being met. For the first time, in a revolutionary step for both Australian society and international relations, Australia looked outside Britain for migrants. In 1947, Calwell agreed to bring 12,000 people every year from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Many of these people were refugees who were being cared for by the International Refugee Organisation (IRO). They were accepted on humanitarian grounds with the condition that they would remain in Australia for two years and work in government selected jobs. 182,159 people were sponsored by the IRO from the end of World War II up to the end of 1954 to resettle in Australia from Europe.

Over the next twenty years, patterns of immigration continued to change. The government encouraged more people to come to Australia and many more assisted agreements were made with countries. In the late 1950s, more immigrants began to be accepted from the Middle East. In 1958, under the &quot;Migration Act 1958&quot;, the dictation test was removed and a new universal visa scheme or entry permits introduced. This allowed non-Europeans to immigrate. Their entry was now based on what they could contribute to Australia and if it could be shown that they could integrate into Australian society. This attracted many professionals and highly qualified people who added to Australia&#x27;s relatively small tertiary industry.

The Australian government assisted many of the refugees, such as helping them find work (due to an expanding economy and major infrastructure projects, the Snowy Mountains Scheme being the most famous). This growth of immigration greatly changed the national image regarding the Australian way of life which, before the war, had been dominated by Anglo-Saxons. Immigration was still strict in allowing non-Europeans to immigrate into the country due to the White Australia Policy.

The White Australia Policy began to be abandoned in 1966, under Prime Minister Harold Holt. The last reside of the policy was finally abolished in 1973 under the Government of Gough Whitlam.

== Modern era ==
During the 1970s and 1980s, around 120,000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration Al Grassby termed &quot;multiculturalism&quot;. The development of Australia&#x27;s multicultural policy was heavily influenced by the Galbally Report of 1978, which addressed issues with living in and planning for a multicultural Australian society.

Migration to Australia in the late twentieth century was influenced by a number of world events, including:

* The fall of Saigon in 1975, the start of migration waves from Indo-China to Western countries and Australia.
* The fall of East Timor to Indonesian&#x27;s troops in 1975, which led many East-Timorese to seek refuge in Australia. 
* Dictatorships in South America, which led political dissidents from Chile, Argentina and Uruguay to flee military regimes during the 1970s and seek refuge in Australia.
* The Lebanese Civil War of 1975–1990, which saw many Lebanese refugees come to Australia.
* Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989, as a result of which many Chinese students in Australia were granted permanent residency.
* The Yugoslav Wars in the Balkans from 1991 to 2001, which drove many Albanians, Bosnians, Croats, Serbs, to settle in Australia.
* The Jakarta riots of May 1998, which led migrants from Jakarta to trickle into major cities in Australia.
In 1994–95, Australia accepted 87,000 immigrants, the last financial year before the Howard government was elected. Planned immigrant intake was reduced to 68,000 following the election of John Howard in 1996.

In 2004–05, Australia accepted 123,000 new settlers, a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40,000 in 2004/05) moved to Sydney. The majority of immigrants came from Asia, led by China and India. There was also significant growth in student numbers from Asia, and continued high numbers of tourists from Asia. Planned immigrant intake in 2005-06 had more than doubled compared with the intake of 1996.

As at 2007 immigration accounted just over half the overall growth in Australia&#x27;s population. In N.S.W. and South Australia about three-quarters of the population growth could be attributed to immigration. The planned intake for 2007-08 was almost 153,000, plus 13,000 under the humanitarian program and in addition 24,000 New Zealanders were expected to migrate under specific trans-Tasman agreement.

Since the 1988 Fitzgerald Inquiry, the quota for skilled and business migrants has risen compared with the quota for family reunions. Refugees that are granted a protection visa are eligible for standard social security benefits such as New start and Rent Assistance.
== Asylum seekers ==

In the early 1990s Australian immigration legislation was changed dramatically, introducing the concept of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals, who were popularly referred to as boat people. With a sharp rise in unauthorised boat arrivals in the late 1990s, mostly from war-torn countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, the Howard government enforced the mandatory detention policy created by the previous Paul Keating government. This came to international attention during the Tampa affair of 2001.

During the 2001 election campaign, immigration and border protection became the hot issue, as a result of incidents such as the Tampa affair, the Children overboard affair, and the sinking of the SIEV-X. This was a major factor contributing to the victory of the Coalition, deemed impossible only a few months earlier, and also marked the beginning of the controversial Pacific Solution.

After the election, the government continued with its hard line on unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers. Legislation was developed to excise certain islands from Australia&#x27;s migration zone meaning that if asylum seekers landed on an excised island, Australia was not required to provide access to the Australian courts or permanent settlement. Australia still adheres to its international obligations by considering such refugee applications offshore and providing temporary protection visas to those in genuine need of protection.

By 2004, the number of unauthorised boat arrivals had been reduced dramatically. The government argued that this was the result of its strong policy towards asylum seekers. Others argued that the decrease was the result of global factors, such as changing circumstances in the primary source nations of Afghanistan and Iraq.

== Opposition to immigration ==
In March 1984, Professor Geoffrey Blainey, an Australian historian, made a speech criticizing what he saw as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration to Australia. Blainey&#x27;s remarks touched off a flood of debate and controversy about immigration and multiculturalism, known as the &#x27;Blainey debate&#x27;. In 1984, he wrote a book outlining his ideas on immigration and multiculturalism titled &quot;All for Australia&quot;. Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism throughout the 1980s, claiming multiculturalism was a &quot;sham&quot;, &quot;anti-British&quot; and threatened to transform Australia into a &quot;cluster of tribes&quot;.

Blainey&#x27;s views were echoed by some politicians. In August 1988, John Howard, then opposition leader, launched the &quot;One Australia policy&quot;, stating that he believed the rate of Asian immigration into Australia should be slowed for the sake of social cohesion. He stated: &quot;I do believe that if it is – in the eyes of some in the community – that it&#x27;s too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.&quot;

In her maiden speech to the House of Representatives after her election in 1996, Pauline Hanson expressed her concern that Australia &quot;was in danger of being swamped by Asians&quot;. This message exposed a population deeply divided on the issue of immigration. Hanson went on to form the One Nation Party, which subsequently won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections. Hanson claimed government policies were favoring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians. The issue of immigration remains highly sensitive in Australia.

A 2018, Lowy Institute Poll found that a majority of Australians oppose the current rate of immigration to Australia. In 2018, 54% of Australians say that ‘the total number of migrants coming to Australia each year is too high’. A minority say it&#x27;s ‘too low’ (14%). These results represent a significant rise in opposition to the existing migration rate – up 14 points since last year, and up 17 points since we first asked this question in 2014. Immigration to Australia came to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn saw a shrinkage of the Australian population for the first time since World War I.

<text>was a Japanese actor, voice actor and narrator from Kōtō, Tokyo. Throughout his life, he was attached to TV Talent Center Tokyo, Yoshizawa Theatre School and then Mausu Promotion; he was attached to Aoni Production at the time of his death. His real name, as well as his former stage name, was . He was best known for his roles in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series (as Mister Satan and numerous other characters), the &quot;Gundam&quot; series (as Dozle Zabi and Bask Om), &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; (as Gemma Himuro), &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; (as Robin Mask), &quot;Patlabor&quot; (as Hiromi Yamazaki), &quot;Star Fox&quot; (as General Pepper, Andross, and Pigma Dengar), &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; (as Bass Armstrong), &quot;Tekken&quot; (as Heihachi Mishima), and &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; (as Edge Master) – as well as his distinctive deep, booming voice.

==Death==
According to fellow voice actors, Gōri was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus a few years prior to his death and his vision was affected by retinal detachment as a result of the disease. He complained to coworkers, During an &quot;Anpanman&quot; recording session in late 2009, a depressed-sounding Gōri told his close friend and voice actor Kazuhiko Inoue, .

On January 17, 2010 at approximately 3:00 P.M., Gōri was found lying on his stomach with blood dripping from his wrists in the middle of a street in Nakano, Tokyo by a passerby, who then notified the police. Authorities from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department&#x27;s Nakano station discovered a utility knife under his body as well as a suicide note (with the words and scrawled on it) addressed to his family in his pants pocket. Gōri&#x27;s death was then ruled a suicide; he was three weeks short of his 58th birthday. His ongoing roles were replaced primarily by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo and the late Unshō Ishizuka.

<text>Michael J. L. Kirby (born August 5, 1941) is a Canadian politician. He sat in the Senate of Canada as a Liberal representing Nova Scotia. He is the former chair of the Mental Health Commission of Canada.

Born in Montreal, Kirby earned a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts in mathematics from Dalhousie University where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and, also a Doctor of Philosophy in applied mathematics from Northwestern University.

In the 1960s Kirby was a professor of business administration and public administration at Dalhousie and also taught at the University of Chicago and the University of Kent.

Kirby worked as principal assistant to the Premier of Nova Scotia Gerald Regan from 1970 to 1973 and Assistant Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1974 to 1976. He served as President of the Institute for Research on Public Policy from 1977 to 1980.

Kirby chaired the federal Task Force on Atlantic Fisheries which was established to recommend how to achieve and maintain a viable Atlantic fishing industry. It issued its report in 1982.

Kirby returned to public service in the 1980s as Secretary to the Canadian Cabinet for Federal-Provincial Relations and Deputy Clerk of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. As such he participated in the federal-provincial negotiations that led to the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. He was elevated to the Canadian Senate by Pierre Trudeau in January 1984 weeks before the prime minister announced his intention to retire.

He remained active in the private sector serving as vice-president of Goldfarb Consultants from 1984 to 1994 at a period when the polling firm was often employed by the Liberal Party of Canada. Kirby also served as a backroom advisor to the Liberals and frequently appeared on television as a political pundit during the 1980s and 1990s.

In 2001, Kirby joined Chapters&#x27; board of directors.

Kirby was the principal author of a 2002 report by the committee on Canada&#x27;s health care system. The report urged greater private sector involvement in health care delivery and was seen as a rival to the royal commission report on health care released by Roy Romanow. Kirby was criticised for having a conflict of interest in his role in writing the report due to his service on the boards of directors of various private health care companies.

On August 15, 2006, Kirby announced his resignation from the Canadian Senate effective on October 31, 2006. His retirement came nearly a decade before his mandatory retirement in August 2016.
In 2007, he was asked by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to become the first Chair of the newly created Mental Health Commission of Canada, a not-for-profit organization that was created in response to his 2003 Senate report on mental health.

In 2008, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Kirby founded Partners for Mental Health and served as its first chair. The organization closed in 2017.

<text>was a of the Northern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts after &quot;Kōō&quot; and before &quot;Ōei&quot;. This period spanned the years from March 1390 to July 1394. After October 1392, Meitoku replaced the Southern Court&#x27;s nengō (&quot;Genchū&quot;).

The emperor in Kyoto was The Southern Court rival in Yoshino until 1392 was .

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara. Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies even though it was known that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession. This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

==Change of era==
* 1390, also called : The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced after &quot;Kōō 2, 15th day of the 1st month.&quot;

In the initial years of this time frame, Genchū (1384–1392) was the Southern Court equivalent &quot;nengō.&quot;

In 1392, the two rival courts were said to be reunited in the era of &quot;Meitoku.&quot; &quot;Genchū&quot; 9 became &quot;Meitoku&quot; 3 when the two courts were reconciled.

==Events of &quot;Meitoku&quot; era==
Ashikaga Yoshimitsu solidified the Bakufu&#x27;s power by suppressing the power of the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and the shugo during the Toki Yasuyuki Rebellion, the Meitoku Rebellion and the Ōei Rebellion. In Meitoku 3/Genchū 9 (1392), the Northern Dynasty confiscated the Sacred Treasures which the Southern Court had possessed. With the abdication of Emperor Go-Kameyama, the dynasties, and eras, were consolidated. Hosokawa Yoriyuki, who had reinstated the Bakufu after it lost its standing in the Kōryaku Coup, died in Meiroku 3 (1392) in the Meiroku Rebellion. His younger brother Hosokawa Yoritomo replaced him as the person in control. In Meitoku 4 (1393), Shiba Yoshimasa became the person in control.

* 1390 (&quot;Meitoku 1&quot;): Kusunoki defeated; Yamana Ujikiyo chastises Tokinaga.
* 1391 (&quot;Meitoku 2&quot;): Yamana Ujikiyo attacks Kyoto, an escalation of the Meitoku War (1391–1394) in which Yoshimitsu tried to diminish the power of the Yamana clan which controlled 11 provinces 
* 1392 (&quot;Meitoku 3&quot;): also known as &quot;Genchū 9&quot;: Northern and Southern courts reconciled under Go-Komatsu.

<doc id="1182639" wikidata="Q425278" url="?curid=1182639" title="Cobalt blue">
<text>Cobalt blue is a blue pigment made by sintering cobalt(II) oxide with aluminium(III) oxide (alumina) at 1200 °C. Chemically, cobalt blue pigment is cobalt(II) oxide-aluminium oxide, or cobalt(II) aluminate, CoAl2O4. Cobalt blue is lighter and less intense than the (iron-cyanide based) pigment Prussian blue. It is extremely stable, and has historically been used as a coloring agent in ceramics (especially Chinese porcelain), jewelry, and paint. Transparent glasses are tinted with the silica-based cobalt pigment &quot;smalt&quot;.

==Historical uses and production==

Ores containing cobalt have been used since antiquity as pigments to give a blue color to porcelain and glass. Cobalt blue in impure forms had long been used in Chinese porcelain. In 1742, Swedish chemist Georg Brandt showed that the blue color was due to a previously unidentified metal, cobalt. The first recorded use of &quot;cobalt blue&quot; as a color name in English was in 1777. It was independently discovered as an alumina-based pigment by Louis Jacques Thénard in 1802. Commercial production began in France in 1807. The leading world manufacturer of cobalt blue in the nineteenth century was Benjamin Wegner&#x27;s Norwegian company Blaafarveværket (&quot;blue colour works&quot; in Dano-Norwegian). Germany was also famous for production of it, especially the blue colour works (&quot;Blaufarbenwerke&quot;) in the Ore Mountains of Saxony.

Cobalt glass is used decoratively, and also as an optical filter to remove or hide certain visible colors.

==In human culture==
Art
* Cobalt blue was the primary blue pigment used for centuries in Chinese blue and white porcelain, beginning in the late eighth or early ninth century.
* Traditional Bunzlauer pottery made by Germans from Bunzlau also made an extensive use of cobalt blue glaze. The pigment was used along with white in classic patterns of blue and white dots before the synthetic production of more variously colored pigments (yielding such colors as green, red, orange).
* Watercolorist John Varley suggested cobalt blue as a good substitution for ultramarine for painting skies, writing in his &quot;List of Colours&quot; from 1818: &quot;Used as a substitute for ultramarine in its brightness of colour, and superior when used in skies and other objects, which require even tints; used occasionally in retrieving the brightness of those tints when too heavy, and for tints in drapery, etc. Capable, by its superior brilliancy and contrast, to subdue the brightness of other blues.&quot;
* Cobalt blue has been used in paintings since its discovery by Thénard, by painters such as J. M. W. Turner, Impressionists such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet, and Post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. It is stable and lightfast and also compatible with all other pigments.
* Maxfield Parrish, known for the intensity of his skyscapes, frequently used cobalt blue, and as a result cobalt blue is sometimes called &quot;Parrish blue&quot;.
* Cobalt blue is a commonly used color for interior decorating.

Automobiles
* Several car manufacturers including Jeep and Bugatti have cobalt blue as paint options.
Construction
* Because of its chemical stability in the presence of alkali, cobalt blue is used as a pigment in blue concrete.
Sports
* Two Major League Soccer teams have cobalt blue as a secondary color: Real Salt Lake from its inception, and Sporting Kansas City on its home uniforms since 2008.
Vexillology
* Several countries including the Netherlands and Romania, and a U.S. state – Nevada – have cobalt blue as one of three shades of their flags.
Video games
* Sega&#x27;s official logo color is cobalt blue. Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega&#x27;s current mascot, was colored to match.

== Toxicity ==
Cobalt blue is toxic when ingested or inhaled. Its use requires appropriate precautions to avoid internal contamination and to prevent cobalt poisoning.

<text>Kuo Ping-Wen or Guo Bingwen (; 1880–1969), courtesy name Hongsheng (鴻聲), was an influential Chinese educator.

==Biography==
Kuo was born in Shanghai, Jiangsu province, and his father was an elder in the Presbyterian Church. He attended Lowrie Institute (The Pure Heart Academy, Qingxin Shuyuan 清心書院), which was connected with the First Presbyterian Church in Shanghai (founded by John Marshall Willoughby Farnham, 1830–1917), graduating in 1896. Kuo Ping-wen then served in the customs and postal bureaus before coming to the United States in 1906 under the sponsorship of the Presbyterian Church. At first, he attended the Preparatory Academy at the University of Wooster, now the College of Wooster, in Ohio, and later, in 1908, he matriculated at the University of Wooster with the support of the Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program.

At Wooster, Kuo was one of the editors of the university newspaper, &quot;The Wooster Voice&quot;, and General Secretary of the Chinese Students Alliance. In 1911 he wrote an extensive article for the newspaper on the history of Chinese students in the United States, beginning with Yung Wing (Rong Hong) 容閎 at Yale University in the mid-nineteenth century. He won several speech prizes for the university and was mentored in oratory by Professor of Speech Delbert Lean. He graduated with honors from the University of Wooster in 1911 and then undertook graduate studies in Education under John Dewey and Paul Monroe at Columbia University, where he received his M.A. degree in 1912 and his Ph.D. in 1914. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Chinese System of Public Education&quot;, was published by the Teachers College at Columbia in 1915 and is a wide-ranging study of the history and structural development of education in China from ancient times onwards. The Chinese edition of the book was published in Shanghai in 1916.

In 1914 Kuo returned to China where he transformed the Nanjing Higher Normal School ( Nanjing Gaodeng Shifan Xuexiao 南京高等师范学校) into the first modern co-educational Chinese University, National Southeastern University (Guoli Dongnan Daxue 国立东南大学), which was later renamed National Central University (Guoli Zhongyang Daxue 国立中央大学) in 1928 and Nanjing University (Nanjing Daxue 南京大学) in 1949, and his ideas exerted a broad influence in Chinese educational circles. In 1921, he became the first chancellor of the Shanghai College of Commerce (Shanghai Shangke Daxue上海商科大学), which in 1917 had emerged from the program in commerce at Nanjing Higher Normal School. The Shanghai College of Commerce was the forerunner of the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) (Shanghai Caijing Daxue 上海财经大学). Kuo was the president of National Nanjing Higher Normal School from 1919-1923 and National Southeastern University from 1921-1925.

Kuo Ping-wen was elected three times as Vice-Chairman of the World Education Congress (Shijie Jiaoyuhui 世界教育會) and became the Chairman of its Asian division in 1923. His removal from his presidential post at National Southeastern University in 1925 was a result of the intrusion of political forces into higher education and academia during the turbulent decade of the 1920s in China. Essentially, Kuo had made compromises with the warlords during that decade in order to develop National Southeastern University, and the rise of the Kuomintang set him at odds with the Nationalist leadership. Later on in 1925, he came to the United States to lecture at the University of Chicago and was one of the founders of the China Institute in New York City, and also its director, 1926-1930. He married Ruth How, Xia Yu 夏瑜, on October 12, 1935 in Hangzhou. During the Second World War, Kuo was stationed in London with the Chinese Embassy and then returned to the United States as a member of the Chinese delegation associated with the early formation of the United Nations. He was instrumental in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 and served as the deputy director of the United Nations Relief Rehabilitation Administration. In the last decade of his life, he was President of the Sino-American Cultural Society in Washington, D.C., an organization he founded in 1958. Kuo Ping-wen is buried in Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Maryland.

==Legacy==

In June 2011, the 100th anniversary of Kuo&#x27;s graduation from the University of Wooster, and ninety years after Kuo was appointed as President of National Southeastern University, a conference examining Kuo&#x27;s contribution to higher education in China was held in Nanjing at Southeast University, the site of former Southeastern University which Kuo had helped found. Scholars from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China, and the United States were represented, and the participants presented papers dealing with Kuo&#x27;s educational thought, his ideas on structuring higher education in China, and his impact on relations between East and West. On October 25, 2014, a symposium was held at Columbia University Teachers College dealing with Kuo&#x27;s contributions to higher education in China and to Sino-Cultural institutions and affairs in the United States. Scholars from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China and the United States contributed papers and participated in discussions on Kuo&#x27;s career and its significance. In March, 2016, the book &quot;Kuo Ping Wen: Scholar, Reformer, Statesman&quot;, a collection of essays on Kuo as educator, statesman, and cultural ambassador, edited by Ryan Allen and Ji Liu, was published by Long River Press, and in October, 2016 a book-signing symposium was held at the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at Columbia University.
Since his academic background was shaped at liberal arts institutions, Kuo believed that a well-rounded education in both the sciences and the humanities was essential. Moreover, since his undergraduate experience at the University of Wooster was co-educational, he was a strong supporter of women&#x27;s education in China. It was at the University of Wooster that Kuo changed his plan to study law and focused instead on issues of educational reform, which became the basis for his career once he returned to China. His educational philosophy embraced a strategy based on Four Balances: the balance between well-rounded education and specialized education, the balance between humanistic education and scientific education, the balance between investment in teaching faculty and investment in teaching facilities, and the balance between national and international learning. Kuo felt that China could learn much from the study of Western accomplishments in science, just as the West could learn much from China about the philosophy of life, and he was a strong supporter of the expansion of Chinese studies at American colleges and universities. In furthering interactions between East and West through education, Kuo Ping-wen contributed to building the Sino-American relationship that flourishes today.

<text>James Wheeler Woodford Birch, commonly known as J. W. W. Birch (3 April 1826 – 2 November 1875) was a British colonial official who was assassinated in the Malay state of Perak in 1875, an event that led to the outbreak of the Perak War and ultimately to the extension of British political influence over the Malay Peninsula.

==Background==
Born in 1826, Birch served for a short period in the Royal Navy before joining the Roads Department in Ceylon in 1846. His career in Ceylon was successful, and on 6 June 1870 he was transferred to Singapore to take up the position of Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements.

Following the Pangkor Engagement, under which Raja Abdullah had agreed to accept a British political agent to be known as a &quot;Resident&quot; at his court, Birch was appointed to the post on 4 November 1874 as the government custodian to the Sultan of Perak.

== Assassination ==
Birch became involved in the institution of slavery in Malaysia during his stay there, which ultimately resulted in his assassination. 
A Malay deputation entreated with Governor-General Andrew Clarke in Singapore &quot;to prevent the Resident from interfering with religion and custom, from acting without consulting Sultan and chiefs, and from depriving them of their property, namely fugitive slaves and feudal dues.&quot; Clarke had already observed on 25 March 1875 that, &quot;I am very much annoyed with Birch and the heads-over-heels way in which he does things; he and I will come to sorrow yet, if he does not mind.&quot; Due to unfavourable responses, on 21 July 1875 Raja Abdullah called a meeting of chiefs where after discussing poisoning Birch, they accepted Maharaja Lela&#x27;s offer to stab Birch to death.

Birch was killed on 2 November 1875 by followers of a local Malay chief, Maharaja Lela, including Sepuntum, who speared him to death while he was in the bath-house of his boat, &quot;SS Dragon&quot;, moored on the Perak river-bank below the Maharaja Lela&#x27;s house, in Pasir Salak, near today&#x27;s Teluk Intan (Teluk Anson).

While experienced in the affairs of colonial government, he was never comfortable speaking Malay, he also aroused the hostility of several Perakian chiefs due to the new taxation collection system and his enforcement of public humiliation to enforce his authority such as burning homes and ordering the surrender of arms and slaves.

Sultan Abdullah, who was also believed to have had some complicity in the assassination, was deposed and exiled to Seychelles. His rival Raja Yusuf was installed as sultan in his place.

In the aftermath of the event, the administration shifted to Taiping. A new Resident, Sir Hugh Low, was appointed and went about his administration of Perak in a more diplomatic way. Whilst still banning outright slavery, he gradually phased out debt-slavery and assuaged the feelings of the ruler and chieftains by allowing for adequate monthly compensation to them.

=== Historical interpretations of Birch&#x27;s assassination ===
Malaysian historian Cheah Boon Kheng argues that while &quot;in present-day Malaysian school history textbooks,&quot; Birch&#x27;s assassination &quot;is presented as an anti-colonial uprising, in which almost all the Perak Malays participated&quot;, in fact the political situation in Perak was more complex, with deep divisions between supporters of the two rival claimants to the throne of Perak, Raja Abdullah and Raja Ismail. Cheah argues that Maharaja Lela&#x27;s actions in contributing to Birch&#x27;s death must be understood in the context of Malay feudal rivalries and not as an early example of resistance to imperialism.

==Memorial==
Birch&#x27;s grave is located near the site of the British fort at Kampung Memali, about 24 km from Pasir Salak. His grave is now covered by a palm oil estate. The Birch Memorial Clock Tower was built in 1909 and still stands in front of the Ipoh State Mosque. One of the 44 figures on the clock, an image of Muhammad, was painted over in the 1990s due to religious sensitivities. Roads in Kuala Lumpur and Taiping were thought to have been named after him (Birch Road), but this was for a different Birch (namely, his eldest son Ernest Woodford Birch, also a Resident of Perak). The same road was renamed Maharajalela Road () after Malaya&#x27;s independence in 1957. Similarly, there are Birch Roads in several towns in Malaysia (Seremban, Penang and Ipoh) and in Singapore.

==Drama and film==
Malaysian dramatist Kee Thuan Chye&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;We Could Kill You, Mr Birch&quot; is a dramatic reinterpretation of the events around the Birch assassination.

There have been several unsuccessful attempts to make a film based on the Birch assassination. The Malaysian actor, director and politician Jins Shamsuddin, who was from Perak, announced plans in 2004 to make a film entitled &quot;The King of the River: Pasir Salak&quot;, which was to have been an epic production involving 1,500 extras. However, the film was never completed: Jins Shamsuddin commented in 2009 that making a film about Birch was a lifelong dream, saying, &quot;I hope to complete my movie on the historical events that happened in Pasir Salak before I die.&quot; Malaysian director Mamat Khalid, who was also from Perak, commented in December 2016 that after 18 years of preparation, his film about Birch, &quot;Pasir Salak Pasir Berdarah (The Sand of Pasir Salak is the Sand of Blood)&quot; would soon enter production. At the time of Mamat Khalid&#x27;s death in 2021, the film was unfinished but the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia announced that it would support the completion of the film.

<text>Jyrki Olavi Lumme (born July 16, 1966) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) and SM-liiga. After beginning his career in Finland, playing with Ilves Tampere for three seasons, he moved to North America to join the Montreal Canadiens in 1988. The Canadiens had selected Lumme two years prior in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft 57th overall. In his second NHL season, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks, with whom he spent the majority of his career and enjoyed the most success. Over nine seasons with the Canucks, Lumme was named the club&#x27;s annual top defenceman on four occasions, became the team&#x27;s all-time top goal- and point-scoring defenceman, and was a part of the squad&#x27;s run to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. Towards the end of his NHL career, he additionally played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs over the span of five seasons. In 2005, Lumme returned to Ilves Tampere of the SM-liiga after a two-year playing hiatus. He played two final campaigns in Finland before retiring, at which point he became a part-owner of Ilves Tampere.

==Playing career==

===Early career (1985–90)===
Lumme began his professional career in with Ilves Tampere of the SM-liiga in 1985–86. Following his rookie season in Finland, Lumme was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the 3rd round (57th overall) of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He remained with Ilves Tampere for two seasons following his draft. In his final year before transferring to the NHL, Lumme scored 8 goals and 30 points over 43 games to help Ilves to the best regular season record in the league.

In August 1988, Lumme signed a two-year contract with the Canadiens. Playing his first season in North America, Lumme split the 1988–89 campaign between Montreal and their minor league affiliate, the Sherbrooke Canadiens of the American Hockey League (AHL). He became the first Finnish player to compete for the Canadiens in team history. While playing in an NHL game against the Detroit Red Wings on December 5, 1988, he suffered a knee injury, sidelining him for some time. He finished the season with 15 points over 26 AHL games, while registering 4 points over 21 NHL games within the Canadiens organization. The following season, Lumme earned a full-time NHL roster spot with the Canadiens.

After scoring 20 points over 54 games with Montreal during the campaign, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on March 6, 1990. In exchange for Lumme, Montreal acquired the St. Louis Blues&#x27; second-round selection in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft (previously acquired by Vancouver; Montreal selected Craig Darby). In retrospect of the trade, Lumme recalls not fitting into the Canadiens&#x27; playing style and expecting to be dealt away.

===Vancouver Canucks (1990–98)===
Lumme proved to be a good fit in Vancouver as he quickly established himself as the Canucks&#x27; top offensive defenceman. He was placed on a defensive pairing with Paul Reinhart immediately after the trade and scored 10 points in 11 games to finish the regular season. In his first full season with Vancouver, Lumme improved to 32 points over 80 games. The following season, he recorded his first of back-to-back 44-point seasons and earned his first of four Babe Pratt Trophies as the team&#x27;s top defenceman. In 1993–94, Lumme posted a career-high 55 points, second only to late-season acquisition Jeff Brown among team defencemen. He added 13 points in 24 playoff games, helping Vancouver to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the New York Rangers in seven games.

Due to the subsequent 1994–95 NHL lockout, Lumme returned to Finland to play for Ilves Tampere. He recorded 8 points in 12 games before NHL play resumed midway through the campaign, at which point he returned to the Canucks. Lumme continued as one of the Canucks&#x27; standout defencemen for the duration of his time with the club, as his defensive game improved as well. He fell only one point short of his career high during the 1995–96 season, scoring 54 points — first among team defencemen. He also managed a personal best 17 goals. The following season, he won his fourth and final Babe Pratt Trophy in 1997. Lumme led the Canucks&#x27; defence in scoring his final two years in Vancouver before becoming an unrestricted free agent in July 1998 and signing with the Phoenix Coyotes. He left Vancouver as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leading scorer among defencemen in goals with 83 (surpassed by Mattias Öhlund on December 15, 2007) and points with 321 (tied Dennis Kearns and since surpassed by Öhlund).

===Post-Vancouver (1998–2007)===
Playing with his third NHL club, Lumme remained a prominent member on his team&#x27;s blueline. With 28-, 40- and 25-point seasons in Phoenix, Lumme finishing second among team defencemen in scoring behind Teppo Numminen in all three campaigns. On June 23, 2001, he was traded from Phoenix to the Dallas Stars in exchange for forward Tyler Bouck. Lumme played 15 games with the club in 2001–02. He left the Stars on October 29, 2001, to briefly visit his family in Finland after receiving permission from general manager Bob Gainey. His wife Minna and two kids had planned to join Lumme in Dallas during the season, but were reluctant to take a plane after the recent 9/11 terrorist attacks. Lumme and coach Ken Hitchcock clashed openly during his brief time in Dallas, however, and he was put on waivers. After clearing, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for another veteran blueliner, Dave Manson, on November 21, 2001. The deal was initiated by Maple Leafs general manager Pat Quinn, Lumme&#x27;s former coach and general manager in Vancouver, who commended Lumme as a &quot;cornerstone&quot; for the Canucks&#x27; success during his time with the club.

Near the end of the season, Lumme was suspended two games for cross-checking Buffalo Sabres forward J. P. Dumont in a game on March 2, 2002. He also missed an additional four games with a shoulder injury. Following the trade from Dallas, he posted 12 points in 51 games for Toronto. During the 2002 playoffs, Lumme suffered a concussion and re-aggravated his shoulder during the second round against the Ottawa Senators. He suffered the injury after being hit into the boards by opposing forward Chris Neil. Sidelined for the remainder of the playoffs, he watched as the Leafs were eliminated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the semifinals.

After discovering his shoulder injury did not require surgery, Lumme spent the 2003 off-season rehabilitating himself in Vancouver, British Columbia. Prior to the 2002–03 season, he was left unprotected for the NHL&#x27;s waiver draft. With Lumme set to earn $2.75 million that season, however, he went unselected and remained with Toronto, scoring 17 points in 73 games. He played his last NHL game on April 23, 2003, registering an assist against the Philadelphia Flyers. At the end of the season, the Maple Leafs bought out the final remaining year on Lumme&#x27;s contract for two-thirds of his expected $1.5 million salary.

After his buy out, Lumme took a two-year playing hiatus. During this time, he returned to Vancouver, doing broadcast work for Finnish television. He also became a part-owner of his former Finnish club, Ilves Tampere. In 2005, he returned to play for Ilves. Following his retirement in 2007, Lumme became a part-owner of the Ilves hockey club.

==Playing style==
Though Lumme&#x27;s smooth skating and accurate wrist shot made him best known as an offensive defenceman, during the peak of his career he was reliable in his own end too, with an effective backhand that allowed him to clear the zone with ease. Playing on the West Coast, many analysts felt that Lumme never received the kind of acclaim he might have in an NHL market with more media exposure. In this vein, Canuck broadcaster Tom Larscheid once called him &quot;the best kept secret outside of British Columbia.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lumme and his wife have two children. Following his retirement, he settled with his family in a countryside cabin in Finland. He returns to Vancouver often, retaining his home in North Vancouver from his playing career with the Canucks.

Lumme is involved with the NHL Players Association Goals and Dreams Program, an organization that donates hockey equipment to children of low-income families worldwide. He donates his time generously for many celebrity hockey tournaments.

<text>The Ratha Yatra of Puri, also rendered as the Ratha Jatra () (, ), is considered the oldest and largest Hindu chariot festival celebrated annually, on the bright half of the lunar month of Ashadh (June–July). The festival is held at the city of Puri, in the state of Odisha, India and associated with the deity Jagannath (a form of Vishnu or Krishna). During the festival, three deities (Jagannath, his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra) are drawn by a multitude of devotees in three massive, wooden chariots on &quot;bada danda&quot; (the grand avenue) to Gundicha Temple whereby they reside there for a week and then return to the Jagnannath temple. This return trip is referred to as the Bahuda Yatra.
On the way, the chariot of Jagannatha, Nandighosa (ନନ୍ଦିଘୋଷ) waits near the crematorium of Bhakta Salabega (ଭକ୍ତ ସାଲବେଗ), a Muslim devotee, to pay him tribute.

On their way back from the Gundicha Temple, the three deities stop for a while near the Mausi Maa Temple (Aunt&#x27;s abode) and have an offering of the Poda Pitha, which is a special type of pancake supposed to be the deity&#x27;s favourite. After a stay of seven days, the deities return to their abode.

== History ==
Descriptions of the Ratha Yatra can be found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana, the Skanda Purana, and the Kapila Samhita. Records of the festival have been noted by European travelers since the 13th century, with the most prominent and vivid descriptions noted in the 17th century. 

== The Chariots ==
The three chariots of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are newly constructed every year with wood of specified trees like phassi, dhausa, etc. They are customarily brought from the ex-princely state of Dasapalla by a specialist team of carpenters who have hereditary rights and privileges for the same. The logs are traditionally set afloat as rafts in the river Mahanadi. These are collected near Puri and then transported by road.

The three chariots are decorated as per the unique scheme prescribed and followed for centuries stand on the Bada Danda, the Grand Avenue. The chariots are lined across the wide avenue in front of the temple close to its eastern entrance, which is also known as the Sinhadwara or the Lion&#x27;s Gate.

Around each of the chariots are nine Parsva devatas, painted wooden images representing different deities on the chariots&#x27; sides. Each chariot has a charioteer (Sarathi) and four horses.

== Chandana Yatra ==
The &quot;Chandan yatra&quot; or &quot;Sandalwood Festival&quot; is a 42 day period that marks the beginning of construction work for the chariots. The period is divided in half, consisting of 21 days each. The first half is known as &quot;Bahar chandan&quot;, whereby the representative images of the presiding deities are taken out in colorful processions and given a ceremonial boat ride in the Narendra tank every day. These deities include Madan Mohan (Jagannath), Rama-Krishna, Lakshmi, Saraswati and the Pancha Pandava - the presiding deities of the five main Shiva temples. The latter, known as &quot;Bhitar chandan,&quot; consists of various rituals not open to the public. The construction of the chariots starts on Akshaya Tritiya, the third day of the bright fortnight of Vaisakha, with ritual fire worship. This takes place in front of the palace of the King of Puri and opposite the main office of the Puri temple. Later the deities have a ritual bath in a small temple in the middle of the tank, in stone tubs filled with water, sandalwood paste, scents, and flowers.

This sandalwood festival culminates in the &quot;Snana Yatra&quot; or &quot;Bathing Festival&quot; which takes place on the full moon day of the month of Jyeshtha. The deities, Jagannath, Balbhadra and Subhadra are bathed with 108 pots of water and then remain in symbolic and ritual convalescence for about two weeks. They are barred from the view of the public. Only three special patta chitras, traditional Oriya paintings of natural colors on cloth stiffened with starch, known as Anasara Pattis, are strung on a bamboo screen hiding the deities from public view, can be seen by the public. During this period, the deities are given only roots, leaves, berries and fruits to cure them of their indisposition. This ritual is a reminder of the strong tribal elements in the genesis and evolution of the Jagannatha cult. The progeny of Lalita, daughter of the original tribal worshipper Biswabasu, chieftain of hunters, and the Brahmin priest Vidyapati, are known as daitapatis or daitas. They have the almost exclusive privilege of serving the deityduring the convalescence and through the entire period of Ratha Jatra or the Festival of Chariots.

== Suna Besha ==

After the chariots of the deities return to the main temple from the Gundicha temple, the deities are attired in gold ornaments and worshipped on the chariots. This celebration is known as Suna Besha. Tradition maintains that this event was first started by King Kapilendra Deva in 1460, when after returning victorious from war he donated gold to Jagannath. The deities are adorned with gold jewelry weighing nearly 208  kg. In 2014 nearly nine hundred thousand devotees witnessed this event held on 9 July.

== The Ratha Yatra and Pahandi of 2015 ==
In 2015 on the occasion of Rath Yatra, lakhs of devotees thronged the coastal town of Puri to catch a glimpse of the deities re-embodied after 19 years on chariots. This was the largest-ever religious congregation in Odisha.

== International Ratha Yatras ==
The Ratha Yatra festival has become a common sight in most major cities of the world since 1968 through the ISKCON Hare Krishna movement. A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada popularised the festival globally, which now happens on an annual basis in over 108 cities including: Moscow, New York, Houston, Atlanta, London, Rome, Zurich, Kolkata, Mumbai, Karachi, Berlin, Heidelberg, Cologne, Florence, Wrocław, Sydney, Perth, Kampala, Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Mexico City, Dublin, Belfast, Manchester, Birmingham, Alchevsk, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Stockholm, Bath, Budapest, Auckland, Melbourne, Montreal, Paris, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver, Santiago, Tallinn, Lima, Antwerp, Sofia, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Oslo, Zhongshan, Myitkyina, Bangkok, Port of Spain, Manama and many other cities. The Ratha Yatra in Dhamrai, Bangladesh, is one of the most important in Bangladesh.

== Ratha Yatra dates ==

This table shows the dates for Ratha Yatra held in Puri, Odisha. These dates shows from the Year Nabakalebara, 2015 to the Year of next (After 19 years) Nabakalebara, 2034.


== Service offerings ==
Jagannath temple employs different kinds of sevakas who offer their services on the Ratha.
* Suara
* Mahasuara
* Dahuka: Ratha dahuka boli (, also &quot;Dahuka gita&quot; (ଡାହୁକ ଗୀତ)) which are poetic recitations. Ratha Yatra being a symbolic expression of fertility and Life cycle, these &quot;boli&quot; sung by the Dahuka contain bawdy songs. It is believed that unless the Dahuka boli is sung &#x27;Ratha&#x27; does not move. These songs are sung publicly without any kind of hold on the lyrics. Dahuka controls the movement of Ratha during the festival.
* Daita pati
* Puspalaka
* Banati Players: Banati is an age-old art, in which a person spins balls set on fire and tied to the ends of a rope. Every year during the Rath yatra devotees perform &quot;Banati&quot; to appease Jagannath. Knives and fireballs, which are attached to the Banati add colour to the procession of the deity as it reaches its destination

===Hera Panchami===
Hera Panchami is a ritual observed during the period of Rath Yatra in the Grand Jagannath Temple of Puri. It is known as a ritual of Goddess Lakshmi. The fifth day from Rath Yatra, i.e., the fifth day in bright fortnight of Ashadha is known as the Hera Panchami. During Ratha Yatra, lord Jagannath comes out on a divine outing with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra along with his divine weapon Sudarshana, leaving behind His wife Mahalaxmi. The Goddess expresses her anger for the deity. She proceeds to the Gundicha Temple, the Adapa Mandapa in a palanquin in the form of a Subarna Mahalaxmi and threatens Him to come back to the temple at the earliest. To make Her pleased, the deity concedes to Her by offering her (a garland of consent). Seeing the Goddess furious, the sevakas close the main door of the Gundicha. Mahalaxmi returns to the main temple through the Nakachana gate. In a unique ritual, the Goddess orders one of her attendants to damage a part of the Nandighosa chariot. This is followed by her hiding behind a tamarind tree outside the Gundicha Temple. After some time, she escapes to her home temple in secrecy, through a separate path way known as Hera Gohri Lane The unique ritual is enjoyed by lakhs of devotees of Jagannath.

The rituals of Hera Panchami as an important function of Srimandira finds mention in Skanda Purana. According to the history of the Temple, this &quot;utsav&quot; started during the time of Maharaja Kapilendra Deb. Before his reign, the Hera Panchami function was being observed in a symbolic way with recitation of Mantras.As stated in Madala Panji, Raja Kapilendra Deb substituted this practice with the introduction of an idol of Mahalaxmi made of gold and making the celebration more realistic.

<text>The Luangwa River is one of the major tributaries of the Zambezi River, and one of the four biggest rivers of Zambia. The river generally floods in the rainy season (December to March) and then falls considerably in the dry season. It is one of the biggest unaltered rivers in Southern Africa and the that make up the surrounding valley are home to abundant wildlife.

== Source and upper-middle course ==

&quot;Note: distances stated are approximate straight-line distances from source&quot;. The Luangwa rises in the Lilonda and Mafinga Hills in north-east Zambia at an elevation of around , near the border with Tanzania and Malawi, and flows in a southwesterly direction through a broad valley. About from its source it has dropped to an elevation of about and becomes a meandering river with a floodplain several kilometres wide. Over the next the meanders increase, with many oxbow lakes and abandoned meanders. Near Mfuwe, the river&#x27;s elevation has dropped to about , the floodplain is about wide and the valley reaches about wide, with a north-west escarpment (Muchinga Escarpment) about high, and a south-western escarpment about high. In the dry season some sections, especially in the upper reaches, dry out completely, leaving isolated pools.

The upper and middle parts of the valley contain the North Luangwa National Park and South Luangwa National Parks of Zambia. The river itself is home to large populations of hippopotamuses and crocodiles. The world&#x27;s largest concentration of hippos lives in the Luangwa Valley. In the dry season they are restricted by the shrinking river and pools, and are easily seen especially in isolated pools.

In addition to being a source of water, the oxbow lakes and pools increase the biodiversity of the valley in other ways. The hippopotami which live in them feed on land vegetation at night. Their dung feeds some fish and fertilises the pools, increasing fish life which in turn feed crocodiles and birds.

In the dry season, the grazing land animals and their predators congregate near the river and pools, and are easily seen. In the rainy season they graze further afield and are more easily hidden in the growth of new vegetation.

At about the valley narrows to about and becomes divided by a ridge into two parallel valleys, with a tributary, the Lukusashi River in a wide valley to the northwest, and the Luangwa in a wide valley to the southeast. The river meanders less, and the floodplain narrows.

The principal settlement in the Middle and Upper Luangwa Valley is Mfuwe which serves the tourism industry and has an international airport. Very few humans otherwise inhabit the valley.

== Lower course ==

At the river abruptly enters a narrow valley between hills rising some from the broader valley floor, becoming almost a gorge. About from its source the Luangwa merges with its tributary, the Lukusashi, after the latter has merged with the Lunsemfwa River coming from the opposite direction, and turns due south through a steep narrow valley: this is its exit from the Luangwa Rift Valley. After only it emerges from the hills into the broad valley of the Zambezi and meanders over sandy flats about wide in a floodplain in width. It merges with the deeper Zambezi at Luangwa town. The lower section of the river forms the border between Zambia and Mozambique.

== Rift valley ==

The Luangwa Valley is a rift valley or graben forming a south-west extension of the east African Rift, branching off its Lake Rukwa-Lake Malawi southern section, and reaching almost as far as Lusaka. The junction is not obvious because it filled with material spewed out from an ancient, extinct volcano. There are at least 20 hot springs, characteristic of a rift valley, in the valley or on its escarpments.

The Luangwa flows along four-fifths of the Luangwa Rift Valley to the point where it meets the Lukusashi and the Lunsemfwa which has come from the opposite direction. At one time, millions of years ago, there was no way out and the Luangwa Rift filled with a Rift Valley Lake called the Madumabisa Lake, which rivalled Lake Malawi in size. The water of the lake overflowed in a river to the south-west, towards what is now the Kalahari, where it combined with the Okavango, Upper Zambezi, Cuando and Kafue rivers, emptying into the Limpopo River and flowing to the Indian Ocean.

Several geological events combined to produce the current river systems. Faulting produced another graben just to the south of the Luangwa Rift, and running east–west: the Zambezi Rift Valley and the Chicoa Trough. A tributary of the Shire River at the south end of the Great Rift Valley then cut back eastwards through the Chicao Trough and Zambezi Valley, capturing the southerly overspill of the Madumabisa Lake. This tributary became the Zambezi, which over millions of years captured the Kafue, Cuando and the upper Zambezi. Faulting lowered the land between the Luangwa Rift and the Zambezi Rift allowing Madumabisa Lake to drain out into the Zambezi in a channel which became the lower Luangwa River.
== Natural barrier ==

The Luangwa Rift Valley and rivers within it form a natural barrier, with a very low population density. This, the steepness of the terrain, and the existence of the wildlife reserves have resulted in no highways crossing the valley between the Lusaka-Kabwe roads in the west and the Isoka-Chisenga road in the north, a distance of about . The lower Luangwa Valley is crossed by just one road, the Great East Road at the Luangwa Bridge, about south of the Luangwa-Lunsemfwa confluence.

<text>Douglas Walter Belcher (15 July 1889 – 3 June 1953) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Douglas Walter Belcher was born on 15 July 1889 in Surbiton, in the county of Surrey, England. He received his formal education at Tiffin Boys School in Kingston upon Thames. In 1914 he was employed as a furniture salesman in the Antiques department of Waring &amp; Gillow on Oxford Street.

==Military career==
He volunteered pre-war as Rifleman No.9539 with the 5th London Regiment (London Rifle Brigade), T.F., in March 1913, and was mobilized on United Kingdom&#x27;s declaration of war on 4 August 1914 and its entry into World War I.

He entered France with the Regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion in November 1914, and was an awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Second Battle of Ypres in May 1915 whilst a sergeant.

On returning to England in mid-1915 he was presented with the medal by King George V at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in July 1915, and promoted to the rank of Company Sergeant-Major, and served as a training officer with the London Rifle Brigade&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, until receiving a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 3rd Battalion of the 8th London Regiment (Post Office Rifles), T.F., in February 1916.

He married Miss Emily Francis Luxford in Surbiton in January 1917.

He was subsequently assigned as a training officer at the Depot of the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles.

He re-enlisted as a professional soldier with the British Army post-war, and saw Imperial service in the Middle East during the 1920 Iraqi Revolt, and subsequently in Burma. He was discharged from the British Army in 1922.

==Award of the Victoria Cross==
Belcher was awarded the Victoria Cross for heroism in action with the London Rifle Brigade during the 2nd Battle of Ypres in April 1915, when he was 25 years of age.

Citation
He was the second member of the British Army&#x27;s Territorial Force to receive the medal, Lieutenant Geoffrey Woolley having been first awarded it during the fighting at 2nd Ypres a few days earlier.

==Medals awarded in World War I==
Belcher was also awarded the 1914 Star, the British War Medal, Victory Medal along with the Victoria Cross (which is today displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, England).

==Later life==
Belcher suffered from ill health in his middle years, and went through a number of occupations, from running a greengrocer&#x27;s shop in Kent, farming in the county of Suffolk, to clerical work in the City of London. His first marriage produced two sons, but was divorced in the mid 1930s. On the outbreak of World War II he briefly re-enlisted with the British Army, but was discharged soon afterwards through injury and ill health. He remarried in London in 1941, and was resident in Surbiton post-war.

==Death==
He died on 3 June 1953 aged 63. His body was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, in Claygate, Surrey.

<text>Genchū (元中) was a Japanese era of the Southern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts lasting from April 1384 to October 1392. The reigning Emperors were Go-Kameyama in the south and Go-Komatsu in the north.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

<text>Kōwa (弘和) was a Japanese era name (年号, &quot;nengō&quot;, lit. year name) of the Southern Court during the Era of Northern and Southern Courts after Tenju and before Genchū. This period spanned the years from February 1381 to April 1384. The Southern Court emperors in Yoshino during this time-frame were and . The Northern court emperors in Kyoto were and 

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

==Change of era==
* 1381, also called : The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;Tenju&quot; 7.

In this time frame, Eitoku (1381–1384) was the Northern Court equivalent &quot;nengō.&quot;

==Events of the Kōwa Era==
* 1381 (&quot;Kōwa 1&quot;): The emperor travels in procession to see Ashikaga Yoshimitsu at his palacial home in Muromachi.
* 1381 (&quot;Kōwa 1&quot;): the &quot;kampaku&quot; Nijō Yoshimoto is elevated to the position of &quot;daijō daijin.&quot; Yoshimitsu is raised to the Imperial court position of &quot;nadaijin&quot; at the young age of 24. Yoshimoto and Yoshimitsu work well in harmony together.
* 1382 (&quot;Kōwa 2&quot;): Yoshimitsu is raised to the court position of &quot;sadaijin&quot;, and several days later, he was named General of the Left (&quot;sadaisho&quot;). In this same period, Fujiwara no Sanetoki is elevated from the position of &quot;dainagon&quot; to &quot;nadaijin.&quot;
* 1383 (&quot;Kōwa 3&quot;): Emperor Go-Kameyama ascends southern throne.

<text>Mikael Ljungberg (13 June 1970 – 17 November 2004) was a Swedish wrestler from Gothenburg. He competed for Örgryte IS&#x27;s wrestling section.

Ljungberg was one of the most successful Swedish wrestlers ever. He won World Championship gold medals in 1993 and 1995, European Championship gold medals in 1995 and 1999, and an Olympic gold medal in 2000.

In the summer of 2004, the &quot;Complete Book of the Olympics&quot; 2004 edition wrongly reported Mikael Ljungberg had been suspended in 1994 for using a banned performance-enhancing drug. This was silently corrected in the 2008 edition of the same book.

On 17 November 2004, while receiving care for depression at the psychiatric ward of the Mölndal hospital outside Gothenburg, he committed suicide by hanging himself. His brother reported in interviews afterwards that Mikael was a sensitive person who took setbacks seriously. Also, it was reported that his life after his professional career came to an end had been difficult for him; his mother had died in 2002, the same year as he went through a divorce.

Just before his death he was appointed manager of the sport section for the Swedish Wrestling Federation, an office he would have entered on 1 January 2005.

<doc id="1182696" wikidata="Q846063" url="?curid=1182696" title="Kafue River">
<text>The long Kafue River is the longest river lying wholly within Zambia. Its water is used for irrigation and for generating hydroelectric power. It is the largest tributary of the Zambezi, and of Zambia&#x27;s principal rivers, it is the most central and the most urban. More than 50% of Zambia&#x27;s population live in the Kafue River Basin and of these around 65% are urban.

It has a mean flow rate of through its lower half, with high seasonal variations. The river discharges per year into the Zambezi River.

== Course ==

=== Sources ===
The Kafue River rises at an elevation of on the relatively flat plateau just south the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo north-west of Chingola in the Copperbelt Province. The source of the Kafue River is in the North-western Province of Zambia. The area is Miombo woodland on the Congo-Zambezi watershed, with many branching dambos lying lower than the highest ground, producing a very gently undulating topography. The river starts as a trickle from the marshy dambos (the Munyanshi Swamp is a tributary) and with little slope to speed up river flow, it meanders south-eastwards sluggishly and within has the character of a mature river. The area receives about of rain in the rainy season, and the river&#x27;s channel soon reaches wide with a floodplain of fluvial dambos wide.

=== Copperbelt ===
Before the river reaches the Copperbelt towns, however, it loses its wide floodplain, the channel narrows to 30–40 m and it meanders less, in a shallow valley only 40 m or so lower than the surrounding plateau. It flows close to the Copperbelt towns of Chililabombwe, Chingola and Mufulira, and through the outskirts of Kitwe. The popular picnic spot the Hippo Pool north of Chingola is protected as a national monument.

In the Copperbelt, water is taken from the river to irrigate small farms and market gardens. At Kitwe it changes course to the south-west and flows through forest and areas of flat rock over which it floods in the wet season, keeping to a channel about 50 m wide in the dry season.

=== Lukanga Swamp ===
The river again develops intricate meanders and a maze of channels in a swampy floodplain, with oxbow lakes and lagoons. It flows 20 km west of the permanent part of the Lukanga Swamp which fills a circular depression, and which drains through a channel into the Kafue. The area between the swamp and river is flood plain and when that and surrounding areas are inundated in the rainy season, the combined wetland exceeds 6,000 km2. This is the first of the three main wildlife areas of the river, and the least surveyed and protected.

=== Kafue National Park ===
The character of the river changes again, as it forms a less meandering dry-season channel with sandy banks and islands. Continuing south-west it enters the Kafue National Park, second largest national park in Africa, where it receives its two largest tributaries, the Lunga and Lufupa rivers, also from the north. The Kafue skirts the south-east edge of the Busanga Plain, one of Africa&#x27;s premier wildlife areas, known for large herds of cape buffalo, zebra and antelope. In the rainy season the Lufupa floods the plain.

=== Itezhi-Tezhi Gap ===
Like the upper Zambezi, Okavango and Cuando rivers, the Kafue used to flow south all the way to Lake Makgadikgadi and on to the Limpopo River, but the land in that area was uplifted. A rift valley formed running due east of where the Kafue National Park is now, and the Kafue river eroded a channel called the Itezhi-Tezhi Gap through a ridge of hills about 100 m high, flowing eastwards. The Itezhi-Tezhi Dam was built in 1977 at the gap and now forms a reservoir 50 km long and up to 10 km wide.

=== Kafue Flats ===
Further east, the river flows sluggishly across a flat plain called the Kafue Flats (formerly &quot;Butwa&quot; after the Twa people) and for the third time develops intricate meanders in a maze of swampy channels and lagoons. This time however it also has an immense shallow flood plain which no roads or railways cross, long and about wide, flooded to a depth of less than a metre in the rainy season (deeper in some lagoons and permanently swampy areas), and drying out to a clayey black soil in the dry season. The Kafue Flats are the third major wildlife area of the river. Tens of thousands of Kafue Lechwe live on the Kafue Flats and are adapted to wading the flooded areas. This area also has one of the greatest variety and concentrations of birds in the world. The Lochinvar and Blue Lagoon National Parks have been established on the flats.

Around Mazabuka as the river gets closer to the town of Kafue, sugar plantations and other large agricultural estates have been established on the fertile black soil and use water from the river in the dry season.

=== Kafue Gorge and Dam ===

The Kafue Flats end at Kafue town and from there, as the rift valley gets deeper, the river drops over through the Kafue Gorge. A second dam, the Kafue Gorge Dam, with a smaller reservoir, generates electricity. The lower Zambezi (originally a separate river) cut back through the rift valleys and eventually captured the Kafue. Their confluence is about north of Chirundu.

==Bridges==

===Railway===
See Kafue Railway Bridge for a full account. It was opened in 1906 to connect Kafue with Mazabuka and was originally meant to be part of the Cape to Cairo Railway.

===Road===
The first road bridge across the Kafue was originally built across the Thames in London during the Second World War. After the war, it was dismantled and installed some 9 km downstream from the railway bridge. Previously, road traffic crossed the river by pontoon.

The T3 road crosses the river in-between Chililabombwe and Chingola as well as in the city of Kitwe, both in the Copperbelt Province. The T2 road (Cape to Cairo Road) crosses the river 10 km south of the Kafue town centre. The Lusaka–Mongu Road crosses the river as the Kafue Hook Bridge in the Kafue National Park.

== Environmental issues ==

=== Pollution ===
As it flows through the Copperbelt the Kafue River is at great risk of pollution, not just from urban waste but from copper mine tailings. The swampy areas west of the Lukanga Swamp help silt and pollution settle out so that the river becomes clear downstream. A report in April 2002 said: &quot;… natural wetlands are quite effective at controlling water pollution from mining in the Copperbelt … Tests show the Kafue to be clean of mining pollutants downstream from the Copperbelt.&quot;

In the Kafue flats, the discharge of phosphates in excess fertiliser run-off from commercial farming and the Nakambala Sugar Estate can cause algal blooms and weed growth, reducing fish populations.

Effluent from mining containing cadmium, lead and mercury have degraded the Kafue River Municipal water supply had to be suspended when the Kafue River turned blue due to slurry discharge

Because of its size and geographic location, the Kafue River basin is an ecosystem that provides services and support to communities and industries that have different and sometimes conflicting interests in usage of the river resources. In 1999, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) initiated dialogue between the Zambian Government, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) and local people to restore a more natural flow pattern to water releases from the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam built on the Kafue River.

This project heavily influenced development of Zambian Government policy on water resources and in February 2010, the Zambian Cabinet approved a revised National Water policy that &quot;aims to improve water resources management by establishing institutional coordination, engaging in modern methods of integrated water resource management while decentralising government policy to address diverse interests within the water sector&quot;.

=== Itezhi-Tezhi and Kafue Gorge Dams ===
These have had major negative environmental effects on the river — see main article on the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam.

=== Water for irrigation ===
Commercial plantations, especially those bordering the Kafue flats take large quantities of water for irrigation. Chief of these is the Nakambala Sugar Estate, which draws in excess of 720,000 m3 per day to irrigate 134.13 square kilometres of land to grow sugar cane.

<text>The Gateway is a large, open-air retail, residential, and office complex in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. It is centered on the historic Union Pacific Depot on the west side of Downtown Salt Lake City between 50 North and 200 South streets and between 400 and 500 West streets. Rio Grande Street has been the site of many special events and becomes a one-way street and heads north through the center. The center has featured as many as 89 outlets, but recent changes have allowed the center to provide new retail shopping experiences like and become more of a social gathering place centered on dining and nightlife.

In the northeast corner, a seven-story office tower for more than 1,200 employees was completed in 2007 for the sole occupancy of Fidelity Investments.

By 2014, the center&#x27;s occupancy rate had fallen. Several major tenants such as Apple moved half a mile east to the newer and more centrally-located City Creek Center, opened in 2012 by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Retail Properties of America valued the center to $75 million in 2014 and projected further decline. Previous efforts to stabilize and sell the center failed. Some of the outdoor areas were upgraded, and nearby development projects were planned.

In 2016, The Gateway was sold to a commercial real estate company named &quot;Vestar.&quot; The company was initially planned to renovate the center for $30 million. Ultimately, $100 million was invested by Vestar. Vestar restored the area&#x27;s popularity and increased security, lowering crime by 79% and expecting crime to lower even further. The downtown shelter located on Rio Grande Street has also seen improvement because of the mall&#x27;s new management.

The Megaplex Theatres at The Gateway served as a venue for the Sundance Film Festival in 2023.

In 2021, the W.O.S.B Collective (Women-Owned Small Business Collective) was founded, providing a unique shopping experience at The Gateway. This boutique and gallery offers exclusive and internationally sourced products, including clothing, swimwear accessories, gifts, and local art, that showcase women-owned businesses from across the globe in one location.

<doc id="1182712" wikidata="Q1239275" url="?curid=1182712" title="Western Pacific Railroad">
<text>The Western Pacific Railroad was a Class I railroad in the United States. It was formed in 1903 as an attempt to break the near-monopoly the Southern Pacific Railroad had on rail service into northern California. WP&#x27;s Feather River Route directly competed with SP&#x27;s portion of the Overland Route for rail traffic between Salt Lake City/Ogden, Utah, and Oakland, California, for nearly 80 years. The Western Pacific was one of the original operators of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; passenger line.

In 1982, the Western Pacific was acquired by the Union Pacific Corporation and it was soon merged into the Union Pacific Railroad.

==History==
The original Western Pacific Railroad (1862–1870) was established in 1862 to build the westernmost portion of the first transcontinental railroad, between Sacramento and San Jose, California (later to Oakland). After completing the last link from Sacramento to Oakland, this company was absorbed into the Central Pacific Railroad in 1870.

The second company to use the &quot;western pacific&quot; appellation was the &quot;Western Pacific Railway Company&quot;, founded in 1903. Under the direction of George Jay Gould I, the Western Pacific Railway proposed to build a standard gauge track connection to the Pacific Coast for his aspiring Gould transcontinental system. Construction was financed by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, a company in the Gould system, which had lost access to California due to the attempted acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad by the Rio Grande&#x27;s main rival, the Union Pacific Railroad. The Western Pacific Railway acquired the Alameda and San Joaquin Railroad and began construction on what became known as the Feather River Route. Completed in 1909, it was the last major rail line connected to California. After &quot;Western Pacific Railway Company&quot; defaulted on mortgage bonds, its assets were sold in 1916 to &quot;The Western Pacific Railroad Company&quot;.

The original line used 85 lb/yd rail on untreated ties, with no tie plates except on curves over one degree; in 1935 more than half of the main line still had its original rail, most of it having carried 150 million gross tons.

In 1931 Western Pacific opened a main line north from the Feather River Canyon to the Great Northern Railway in northern California. This route, today part of BNSF&#x27;s Gateway Subdivision, joined the Oakland – Salt Lake City main line at the Keddie Wye, a unique combination of two steel trestles and a tunnel forming a triangle of intersecting track. In 1935, the railroad went bankrupt because of decreased freight and passenger traffic caused by the Great Depression and had to be reorganized.

Western Pacific (WP) operated the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; passenger train with the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The WP handled the &quot;Silver Lady&quot; from Oakland, California, to Salt Lake City, Utah from 1949 to 1970. The Western Pacific owned several connecting short-line railroads. The largest was the Sacramento Northern Railway, which once reached from San Francisco to Chico, California. Others included the Tidewater Southern Railway, the Central California Traction, the Indian Valley Railroad and the Deep Creek Railroad. In December 1953, the Railroad retired its last steam locomotive from revenue service. At the end of 1970, WP operated of road and of track, not including its Sacramento Northern and Tidewater Southern subsidiaries.

After the Union Pacific Corporation purchased the Western Pacific in 1982, the WP became part of a combined Union Pacific rail system: the Union Pacific Railroad, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and the WP. The Union Pacific maintains one locomotive in its fleet, Union Pacific 1983, in a Western Pacific influenced livery.
==Passenger operations==
The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; was the famous Western Pacific passenger train but the railroad had a few others:
* &quot;Exposition Flyer&quot; (Chicago to Oakland in conjunction with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, 1939 to 1949; named after the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939 and 1940)
* &quot;Royal Gorge&quot; (between Oakland and Denver via Pueblo)
* &quot;Scenic Limited&quot; (between Oakland and Denver via Pueblo)
* &quot;Zephyrette&quot; (between Oakland and Salt Lake City)

==Executives==
There were twelve presidents of the railroad:
* Walter J. Bartnett (March 3, 1903 to June 23, 1905)
* Edward T. Jeffery (June 23, 1905 to November 6, 1913)
* Benjamin F. Bush (November 6, 1913 to March 4, 1915)
* Charles M. Levey (July 14, 1916 to March 30, 1927)
* Harry M. Adams (March 30, 1927 to December 31, 1931)
* Charles Elsey (January 1, 1932 to December 31, 1948)
* Harry A. Mitchell (January 1, 1949 to July 1, 1949)
* Frederic B. Whitman (July 1, 1949 to June 30, 1965)
* Myron M. Christy (June 30, 1965 to November 30, 1970)
* Alfred E. Perlman (December 1, 1970 to December 31, 1972)
* Robert G. &quot;Mike&quot; Flannery (January 1, 1973 to June 9, 1982)
* Robert C. Marquis (June 9, 1982 to January 11, 1983)

A Republican, he represented Connecticut in the United States House of Representatives for almost 22 years, and was House Majority leader for 6 years.

==Early life==
Tilson was born in Clearbranch, Unicoi County, Tennessee, on April 5, 1866, to William and Katherine (Sams) Tilson. His father had obtained a grant of 900 acres in the Clearbranch community. He spent his early life on the family farm.

He attended both public and private schools in nearby Flag Pond, and later at Mars Hill, North Carolina. He went to college at Carson–Newman College, in Jefferson City, Tennessee, where he graduated in 1891. Later he enrolled at Yale Law School, where he graduated in 1893.

==Career==
In 1904, Tilson was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives, where he served until 1908, the last two years as speaker. 

He was later elected to United States House of Representatives, serving from 1909 to 1913; he ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1912. Tilson ran for election again and was again reelected to the House of Representatives. He served from March 4, 1915, until his resignation on December 3, 1932. He was the Majority Leader for the 69th Congress, 70th Congress, and the 71st Congress. He became a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1932. 

Speaking of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, he said: &quot;I am in thorough accord with the official accord of Secretary Balfour, as endorsed by the countries of France and Italy, on the subject of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and I shall gladly support a movement in that direction... To whose care should it be more appropriately entrusted than the descendants of those who made such wonderful history there? Jewish history subsequent to the dispersion from Palestine makes it all the more certain that if restored to those who made its forebears earlier history glorious, it will be faithfully kept and sacredly guarded for the benefit of all mankind.&quot;

==Later life==
After his retirement from public life, Tilson returned to the practice of law in Washington D.C., and then in New Haven, Connecticut. He also served as a special lecturer at Yale University on parliamentary law and procedure, and wrote &quot;Tilson&#x27;s Manual&quot;. 

American hedge fund manager and philanthropist Whitney Tilson is his great-grandson.

==Death==
Tilson died in New London, New Hampshire, on August 14, 1958. He is interred at the private burial grounds on the family farm in Clearbranch, Tennessee.

<text>The Union of 17 October (, &quot;Soyuz 17 Oktyabrya&quot;), commonly known as the Octobrist Party (Russian: Октябристы, &quot;Oktyabristy&quot;), was a liberal-reformist constitutional monarchist political party in late Imperial Russia. It represented moderately right-wing, anti-revolutionary, and constitutionalist views.

==History==

The party&#x27;s programme of moderate constitutionalism called for the fulfilment of Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s &quot;October Manifesto&quot; granted at the peak of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Founded in late October 1905, from 1906 the party was led by the industrialist Alexander Guchkov who drew support from centrist-liberal gentry, businessmen, and some bureaucrats.

Unlike their immediate neighbors to the Left, Constitutional Democrats, the Octobrists were firmly committed to a system of constitutional monarchy. At the same time they emphasised the need for a strong parliament and a government that would be responsible to it. They were generally allied with the governments of Sergei Witte in 1905-1906 and Pyotr Stolypin in 1906–1911, but they criticised the government for taking extralegal measures and a slow pace of reforms, especially after the revolution ended in 1907 and they no longer saw the need for the extraordinary measures that they reluctantly supported in 1905–1907. The Octobrists&#x27; programme included private farming and further land reform, which were in tune with Stolypin&#x27;s programme. They also supported the government in its unwillingness to grant political autonomy to ethnic minorities within the empire, although they generally opposed legal restrictions based on ethnicity and religion.

The Octobrists and groups allied with them did poorly in the 1906 elections of the First and Second State Dumas. However, after the dissolution of the Second State Duma on June 3, 1907 (Old Style), the election law was changed in favour of propertied classes and the party formed the largest faction in the Third State Duma (1907–1912). The apparent failure of the party to take advantage of this majority and inability to influence the politics of the government led to a split within the party in 1913 and poor showing in the 1912 Duma election, resulting in a smaller faction in the Fourth State Duma (1912–1917).

In December 1913, after a November conference in St. Petersburg, the Octobrist party split into three factions, effectively new parties: the left Octobrists (16 deputies, including I. V. Godnev, S. I. Shidlovskii, and Khomiakov), the zemstvo Octobrists (57 deputies, including Rodzianko, N. I. Antonov, and A. D. Protopopov), and the right Octobrists (13 deputies, including N. P. Shubinskii and G. V. Skoropadskii).

With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, moderate political parties became moribund in Russia. The Octobrists all but ceased to exist outside the capital, St. Petersburg, by 1915. Several of its prominent members, particularly Guchkov and Mikhail Rodzianko, continued to play a significant role in Russian politics until 1917, when they were instrumental in convincing Nicholas II to abdicate during the February Revolution and in forming the Russian Provisional Government. With the fall of the Romanovs in March, the party became one of the ruling parties in the first Provisional Government.

Some members of the party, such as Vladimir Ryabushinsky, later participated in the White Movement after the October Revolution and during the Russian Civil War (1918–1920), becoming active in White émigré circles after the Bolshevik victory in 1920. By that time, the October Revolution had given the term &quot;Octobrist&quot; a completely different meaning and connotation in Russian politics.

==In other parts of the Russian Empire==
In the Livonian guberniya, a similar party of Baltic German nobility and bourgeoisie named &quot;Baltic Constitutional Party (German: Baltische Konstitutionelle Partei&quot;) was active; its pendant in the Estonian guberniya was &quot;Estonian Constitutional Party&quot;.

<doc id="1182730" wikidata="Q2779399" url="?curid=1182730" title="Manston, Kent">
<text>Manston is a village and civil parish in the Thanet district of Kent, England. The village is situated northwest of Ramsgate. The parish includes four hamlets and the former Manston Airport.

==Etymology==
The village was originally &quot;Mannestone&quot; which means &#x27;farm on top of a hill&#x27; (a possible alternative variation is a farm belonging to a man called Mann) and was recorded in 1254 as &quot;Manneston&quot;, but obtained its modern spelling in 1381 around the time of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt.

==History==
The discovery of an Anglo-Saxon sword at what is known as the Ozengell burial ground and also 200 graves including a Roman stone and lead-lined coffin, never preserved, show that the site has been occupied for many centuries.

In June 1381 the Peasants&#x27; Revolt reached Manston.
:&quot;&quot;A proclamation in the name of Jack Straw and Wat Tyler ordered that labour services should not be performed nor distraints made, and called on the people to destroy the Manston house of William dea Medmenham [a local coroner who evidently acted as representative for St Augustine&#x27;s and Catherine&#x27;s], and if possible behead him. The same day a crowd some 200 strong attacked the house, burnt &quot;the books and muniments&quot; and &quot;took away and burnt the rolls&quot; to the value of 20 marks.&quot;&quot; 

Two road names in the parish give clues to its past. Manston Court Road refers to Manston Court, the seat of the Manston family who held high office, including Richard de Manston at the time of King John (circa 1200) and William Manston, Sheriff of Kent in 1436; and Spratling Street gets its name from the Sprakling family who lived in Ellington in Ramsgate from 1558 to 1659, at a time when Manston was still a part of St Lawrence Extra.

Smuggling was rife in the Isle in the 17th and 18th centuries. Manston Cave, on the road towards Sandwich, was one of the smugglers&#x27; hideouts. Little of it now remains.

In 1901, the Isle of Thanet Poor Law Union opened a children&#x27;s home at Manston. The homes comprised four pairs of houses and could accommodate a total of 120 children. In the 1901 census there were 46 inmates and the Superintendent was Edmund L Martins. One of the orphans, Frank Sidney Smith, an artist, painted a picture of Manston from memory in later life. This is now hanging in St Catherine&#x27;s Church. The children&#x27;s homes have now been converted to residential use. The orphanage&#x27;s school is now the village hall.

During both World Wars the Manston area became important as an aircraft base, particularly in the Second World War as an airfield for emergency landings of damaged Allied bombers returning from the continent. The RAF Manston Museum tells the story of the air station.

The former RAF Manston became home to Kent International Airport, which closed in May 2014. Since 2022, the base has been in use as Manston arrivals and processing centre, an immigration detention centre for migrants who have crossed the English Channel.

==Governance==
Manston Parish Council consists of seven members and holds its meetings in the RAF Museum.

==Geography==
Manston Parish lies in the middle of the Isle of Thanet and includes the hamlets of Haine, Lydden, Woodchurch and Shottendane. A large part of it is agricultural land.

===Climate===
==The village==
St Catherine&#x27;s Church was built in 1872 with monies raised by locals as a Chapel of ease for those of the St Lawrence Parish who were unable to attend the church in St Lawrence. The land was donated by the Vicar of St Lawrence, Rev. G. W. Sicklemore. There is a war memorial on the village green to those who served and died in the two world wars of the twentieth century.

The village pub is The Jolly Farmer, located in what was in 1672 part of a pair of farm dwellings, and originally registered as a public house in November 1738 by Lazarus Haywood under the name &quot;Jolly Farmers&quot;. It was leased to its first tenant Keeper, Samuel Packer (a boot and shoe maker from Ramsgate) in March 1739. During the Second World War the Jolly Farmer was a favourite of pilots stationed at RAF Manston. It was rumoured that many of the pilots signed their names on the ceiling of &#x27;the snug&#x27;, but this has been painted over and so the rumour is unverifiable. The licensee from 1957 to 1980 was the footballer Bert Turner.

There is an active village hall with its own committee, used during elections as a polling station; and two caravan parks: Preston Parks (statics) and Manston Court.

The erstwhile post office and village store is now closed: the post box bearing the mark of GR is all that remains. There is flourishing Garden Club.

==Transport==
Kent International Airport (formerly RAF Manston), located near the village, closed in May 2014. Thanet Parkway railway station, situated south of the village, opened in July 2023.

<doc id="1182740" wikidata="Q5333305" url="?curid=1182740" title="Ecology of the Sierra Nevada">
<text>:&quot;See Sierra Nevada for general information about the mountain range in the United States.&quot;
The ecology of the Sierra Nevada, located in the U.S. states of California and Nevada, is diverse and complex. The combination of climate, topography, moisture, and soils influences the distribution of ecological communities across an elevation gradient from . Biotic zones range from scrub and chaparral communities at lower elevations, to subalpine forests and alpine meadows at the higher elevations. Particular ecoregions that follow elevation contours are often described as a series of belts that follow the length of the Sierra Nevada. There are many hiking trails, paved and unpaved roads, and vast public lands in the Sierra Nevada for exploring the many different biomes and ecosystems.

The western and eastern Sierra Nevada have substantially different species of plants and animals, because the east lies in the rain shadow of the crest. The plants and animals in the east are thus adapted to much drier conditions.

The altitudes listed for the biotic zones are for the central Sierra Nevada. 
The climate across the north–south axis of the range varies somewhat: the boundary elevations of the biotic zones move by as much as from the north end to the south end of the range.

==Western biotic zones==
===Foothill Woodland and Chaparral Zone===

The lowest-elevation biotic zone in the Sierra Nevada is found along the boundary
with the Central Valley. This zone,
stretching in elevation from , is the
foothill woodland zone, an area that is hot and dry in the summer with
very little or no snow in the winter. The foothills are vegetated with grasslands of mostly non-native grasses, mixed grasslands and woodlands savanna, a foothill woodland community of blue oak and gray pine, and chaparral. Many of the plant communities are similar to those found on the inner California Coast Ranges. Animals typical of this zone include black bear, ringtail cat, coyote, gray squirrel, bobcat, California mule deer, and skunk. In the foothills of the northern portion of the Sierra Nevada, toyon and chamise often co-dominate certain open serpentine chaparral communities.

===Lower Montane Forest===
Beginning near the elevation, the hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters of the Mediterranean climate give rise to the lower montane forest zone. This zone is also known as the yellow pine forest zone. The accumulation of several feet of snow during the winter is not uncommon and can stay on the ground for several months. The diversity of tree species found in this zone make this a beautiful and interesting forest to explore. The indicator species for the lower montane forest are the ponderosa pine and the Jeffrey pine: the ponderosa pine generally occurs on the west side of the Sierra, while the Jeffrey pine occurs on the east. The lower montane forests also include trees such as California black oak, sugar pine, incense-cedar, and white fir. Animals that may be found in this zone include the dark-eyed junco, mountain chickadee, western gray squirrel, mule deer, and American black bear. The endangered Yosemite toad is found in montane forests of the central Sierra Nevada, at elevations of .

The character of the Lower Montane Forest changes with latitude. North of Grass Valley, the lower montane forest ranges from , with less ponderosa pine and more Douglas-fir. In the middle Sierra, south to the Merced River, the lower montane forest has the same elevation, but precipitation decreases and the forest mixes with chaparral. In the southern Sierra, the lower montane forest occurs between , but can range as high as , with ponderosa pine dominating the landscape. Unlike further north, the geology of the southern lower montane forest is dominated by granite.

===Mid-Montane Forest===

The mid-montane forest grows on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada at moderate elevations. North of Lake Tahoe, the mid-montane forest occurs from . Between Tahoe and Yosemite, the forest ranges from , while south of Yosemite, it occurs between . The mid-montane zone has a mixed forest of white fir, Coast Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, live oak, black oak, and tanoak, depending on location.

North of Tahoe, the mid-montane forest has more white fir and Douglas-fir, and less ponderosa pine than further south. Jeffrey pine occurs on ultramafic lava soils. In Yosemite and points south, giant sequoia occurs in wetter locations.

===Upper Montane Forest===
The upper montane forest begins at higher elevations near , where the montane climate is characterized by short, moist, cool summers and cold, wet winters. Snow begins to fall in November and may accumulate to depths up to and remain until June. Pure stands of red fir and lodgepole pine (the indicator species) are typical of this forest. Jeffrey pine, which has bark that smells like vanilla, and the picturesque western juniper can also be found in this zone. Wildflowers bloom in meadows from June through August. Common animals in this zone include the hermit thrush, dusky grouse (&quot;Dendragapus obscurus&quot;), great grey owl, golden-mantled ground squirrel, and (more rarely) the marten. Upper montane forests may be viewed from the Tioga Pass Road east of Crane Flat, Glacier Point Road, and State Route 108.

The elevation of the upper montane zone shifts with latitude: it occurs from north of Yosemite, and to the south.

===Subalpine Forest===
The upper montane forest is replaced by the subalpine forest near ,
where the climate is cooler with an even shorter growing season due to long, cold, and snowy winters. Accumulations of three to nine feet (1 to 2.5 m) of snow are typical. The most common tree in the subalpine forest is the whitebark pine. The western white pine, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine are also found in this forest with many subalpine meadows that flower from July through August. Many species live in, or are transient in, this zone, including Clark&#x27;s nutcracker. The vegetation and ecology is determined by the harsh climate, with extensive snow and wind. In addition, soils are thin and nutrient-poor. Due to these harsh conditions, vegetation grows slowly and at low temperatures. In addition, the stressful environment suppress species competition and promotes mutualism. The marginal conditions make the Sierra Nevada subalpine zone sensitive to environmental changes, such as climate change and pollution.

South of Bridgeport, the subalpine forest ranges from of elevation and contains foxtail pines, while to the north, the subalpine forest ranges from and the foxtail pine is absent.

===Alpine Zone===

The alpine zone begins near elevation (in the southern Sierra) and near (in the north). This zone is easily distinguished as it is above the tree line. No trees grow in this zone due to the harsh climatic conditions. Short, cool summers with long, cold, and snowy winters are typical at these
elevations. Many exposed granitic outcroppings, talus slopes, and boulder fields limit the amount of vegetation that grows here. The herbaceous plants need to flower and produce their seeds quickly during the short, frost-free period of summer. Flora includes cushion plants, grasses, willows, and sedges. The macrolichen flora in the Sierra Nevada alpine zone is not well developed as compared to neighboring alpine zones in the Rocky Mountains and mountains of the Pacific Northwest. Some animal species that are adapted to this zone include the American pika, Belding&#x27;s ground squirrel,
the yellow-bellied marmot, and the endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This zone can be viewed up close by hiking or climbing into the high elevations of the Sierra.

==Eastern biotic zones==
The four highest eastern biotic zones are the same as the western zones, but at a higher elevation, due to less precipitation. The elevation of these zones in the Central Sierra are:
* Alpine zone: and above
* Subalpine forest: 
* Upper montane forest: 
* Lower montane forest: (heavily dominated by Jeffrey pines).

In the Owens Valley, the Foothill Woodland Zone is replaced by a
Pinyon-Juniper Woodland Zone, characterized by
single-leaf pinyon pines and sierra junipers. The underbrush contains big sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot;) and blackbrush (&quot;Coleogyne ramosissima&quot;). Jeffrey pines may occur along streams. Notable animals in this zone include the pinyon jay and the desert bighorn sheep. The Pinyon-Juniper Woodland Zone extends down to elevation.

Below , there is not enough precipitation to support
trees. The zones below this elevation are the Sagebrush Scrub Zone,
Saltbush Scrub Zone, and the Alkali Sink Zone. These zones are
distinguished by soil salinity.

==Threats==

===Exotic Plants in Yosemite National Park===

Yosemite National Park has documented more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park&#x27;s resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in the fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow starthistle (&quot;Centaurea solstitialis&quot;), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.

Bull thistle (&quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;), common mullein (&quot;Verbascum thapsus&quot;), and Klamath weed (&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;) have been identified as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow starthistle, sweet clovers (&quot;Melilotus&quot; spp.), Himalayan blackberry (&quot;Rubus discolor&quot;), cut-leaved blackberry (&quot;Rubus laciniatus&quot;) and periwinkle (&quot;Vinca major&quot;).

===Lodgepole needle miner===
The lodgepole needle miner (&quot;Coleotechnites milleri&quot;) is an insect, endemic to the upper Tuolumne and Merced River watersheds of Yosemite National Park and one small headwaters drainage of the San Joaquin River (Sierra National Forest). It lives mostly within the needles of lodgepole pine for two years, emerging as a little gray moth for a few weeks in July of odd-numbered years. This keeps any predators from becoming effective control agents and allows populations to escalate rapidly. While regular prehistoric outbreaks of lodgepole needle miners have been confirmed through dendrochronology, historic records document outbreaks from 1903 to 1921, 1933 to 1941, and 1947 to 1963.

Extensive stands of &quot;ghost forest&quot; and jackstrawed trees are still conspicuous throughout Sierra Nevada. Annual monitoring of lodgepole needle miner density began in 1966, and 28 permanent plots are scattered north of the Cathedral Range. The current outbreak began in 1973 and has been sweeping around the south side of the Cathedral Range, arriving at Sunrise High Sierra Camp in 2001. The Ghost Forest which was evident at the crest between Tenaya Lake and Tuolumne Meadows in the late 1970s was noticeably reforested by 2000. Lodgepole needle miner defoliation currently extends over approximately , with nearly of low to high mortality each year.

While lightning fires are frequent in lodgepole pine communities, they usually remain small, with estimated fire return intervals at Yosemite National Park that are long (relative to most other forest types). Thus, fire suppression activities are thought to have had little influence upon species composition, structure, fuels, and natural processes in lodgepole forests. Also, in comparison with Rocky Mountains lodgepole pine forests, fire plays a smaller role, and so the needle miner assumes greater importance in lodgepole pine forest population dynamics in the Sierra Nevada. However, Rocky Mountain lodgepole forest dynamics are also heavily influenced by insect outbreaks, primarily bark beetles.

==Special-status species==

There are at least 1,300 vascular plant species in the Sierra Nevada, along with numerous bryophytes and lichens. There are at least 450 species of vertebrate animals. A total of 135 plant species in the Sierra Nevada have status as Threatened, Endangered, or Sensitive

Plants that are Federal species of concern (former Category 2 species) under the Federal Endangered Species Act include:

Although Category 2 was abolished in 1996, &quot;species of concern&quot; refers to those species that might be declining or be in need of concentrated conservation actions to prevent decline. Therefore, these six species continue to be evaluated and managed by the National Park Service.

Four state-listed rare plant species are considered restricted and limited throughout all or a significant portion of their range, and may represent disjunct populations at the extreme end of their range: 
#Yosemite onion (&quot;Allium yosemitense&quot;),
#Tompkin&#x27;s sedge (&quot;Carex tompkinsii&quot;),
#Congdon&#x27;s woolly sunflower (&quot;Eriophyllum congdonii&quot;), and
#Congdon&#x27;s lewisia (&quot;Lewisia congdonii&quot;).

Endangered or threatened species of animals that occur in the Sierra Nevada include:
#Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (&quot;Ovis canadensis sierrae&quot;), endangered (2000)
#California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;), endangered (1967)
#Southwestern willow flycatcher (&quot;Empidonax traillii extimus&quot;), endangered (1995)
#Paiute cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki seleniris&quot;), threatened (1975)
#Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;), threatened (1975)
#Owens Tui chub (&quot;Gila bicolor snyderi&quot;), endangered (1985)

==Wetlands==
Wetlands in the Sierra Nevada occur in valley bottoms throughout the range, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from , are generally wetlands, as are the riparian habitats found on the banks of numerous streams and rivers.

The Sierra contains three major types of wetland: 
#Riverine,
#Lacustrine, and
#Palustrine
Each of these types of wetlands varies in geographic distribution, duration of saturation, vegetation community, and overall ecosystem function. All three types of wetlands provide rich habitat for plant and animal species, delay and store seasonal floodwaters, minimize downstream erosion, and improve water quality.

&quot;Riverine&quot; wetlands are found within river and stream channels and are strongly influenced by seasonal runoff patterns. When inundated, riverine wetlands provide habitat for water-tolerant plants such as willows, and aquatic animals such as tadpoles and immature fish.

&quot;Lacustrine&quot; wetlands generally occur on river floodplains and along lakeshores and are influenced by seasonal variations in groundwater levels. These wetlands are rare in the mountain range, but support an abundance of warm-water loving plant and animal species.

&quot;Palustrine&quot; wetlands are typically distinguished from riverine and lacustrine systems by the presence of very dense covers of trees, shrubs, or emergent plants. This wetland type includes wet meadows, densely vegetated riparian habitats, and shallow ponds. They provide cover and forage for wildlife traveling between upland and aquatic habitats.
Since the 1970s the United States has made substantial progress toward protecting and restoring wetland habitats. All federal land in the Sierra Nevada complies with a 1990 Presidential Executive Order that mandates &#x27;no net loss&#x27; of wetlands, and requires federal agencies to map and protect all existing wetlands.

In 1996 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service delineated and classified some of the wetlands of the Sierra Nevada, including all of Yosemite National Park. This was performed through an analysis of aerial photographs and topographic maps, as a part of the National Wetlands Inventory Web Site (NWI). The NWI maps have not been rigorously ground-truthed and only delineate wetlands larger than in size.

The National Park Service restores to natural conditions wetlands that have been drained or filled in the past. Most recently in Yosemite Valley, the Cook&#x27;s Meadow restoration project involved filling old drainage ditches that were draining the meadow and removing an old roadbed that was inhibiting water flow. These actions are currently being monitored with vegetation transects and mapping of surface water to determine how successful the project was in restoring the wetland.

<text>The Polish Air Forces () was the name of the Polish Air Forces formed in France and the United Kingdom during World War II. The core of the Polish air units fighting alongside the Allies were experienced veterans of the 1939 invasion of Poland. They contributed to the Allied victory in the Battle of Britain and Allied air operations during the war.

A total of 145 Polish fighter pilots served in the RAF during the Battle of Britain, making up the largest non-British contribution. By the end of the war, around 19,400 Poles were serving in the Polish Air Forces in Great Britain and in the RAF.


==History==

After the German–Soviet invasion of Poland of 1939, most of the flying personnel and technicians of the Polish Air Force were evacuated to Romania and Hungary, after which thousands found their way to France. There, in accordance with the Franco-Polish Military Alliance of 1921 and the amendments of 1939, Polish Air Force units were to be re-created. However, the French headquarters was hesitant about creating large Polish air units, and instead most Polish pilots were attached to small units, so-called &quot;keys&quot;. Only one large unit was formed, the &quot;Groupe de Chasse polonaise I/145&quot; stationed at Mions airfield. However, it was not until May 18, 1940, that this unit was equipped with planes – and even then these were the completely obsolete Caudron C.714 fighters. After 23 sorties the bad opinion of the plane was confirmed by the front-line pilots. It was seriously underpowered and was no match for the enemy fighters of the period. Because of that, on May 25, only a week after the plane was introduced to active service, French minister of war Guy la Chambre ordered all C.710s withdrawn. However, since the French authorities had no other planes to offer, the Polish pilots ignored the order and continued to use the planes. Although the planes were hopelessly outdated compared to the Messerschmitt Bf 109Es they faced, the Polish pilots nevertheless scored 12 confirmed and 3 unconfirmed kills in three battles between June 8 and June 11, losing 9 in the air and 9 more on the ground. Among the planes claimed shot down were four Dornier Do 17 bombers, but also three Messerschmitt Bf 109 and five Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters. The rest of the Polish units were using the slightly more reliable Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighter. A small improvised Polish unit at Salon and Clermont-Aulnat (now Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport) operated the equally inadequate Koolhoven F.K.58 from 30 May commanded by Captain Walerian Jasionowski.

The Polish Air Force in France had 86 aircraft with one and a half of the squadrons fully operational, and the remaining two and a half in various stages of training. Altogether, the Polish pilots flew 714 sorties during the Battle of France. According to Jerzy Cynk, they shot down 51.9 enemy planes (summing fraction kills – 57 kills including 16 shared victories), in addition to 3 unconfirmed kills and 6 3/5 damaged. According to Bartłomiej Belcarz they shot down 53 aircraft, including 19 kills shared with the French. These 53 victories makes 8% of 693 allied air victories in the French campaign. At the same time they lost 44 planes (in combat, accidents and on the ground) and lost 8 fighter pilots in combat, 1 missing, and 4 in accidents.

===In Britain===
After the collapse of France in 1940, a large part of the Polish Air Force contingent was withdrawn to the United Kingdom. However, the RAF Air Staff were not willing to accept the independence and sovereignty of Polish forces.
Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding later admitted he had been &quot;a little doubtful&quot; at first about the Polish airmen. The British government informed General Sikorski that, at the end of the war, Poland would be charged for all costs involved in maintaining Polish forces in Britain. Initial plans for the airmen greatly disappointed them: they would only be allowed to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, wear British uniforms, fly British flags and be required to take two oaths, one to the Polish government and the other to George VI; each officer was required to have a British counterpart, and all Polish pilots were to begin with the rank of &quot;pilot officer&quot;, the lowest rank for a commissioned officer in the RAF. Only after posting would anyone be promoted to a higher grade.
Because of this, the majority of highly experienced Polish pilots had to wait in training centres, learning English Command procedures and language, while the RAF suffered heavy losses due to lack of experienced pilots. On June 11, 1940, a preliminary agreement was signed by the Polish and British governments and soon the British authorities finally allowed for the creation of two bomber squadrons and a training centre as part of the Royal Air Force.

Dowding had been doubtful about integration of Polish pilots within British squadrons due to language issues and wanted all-Polish units. In August, all Polish airmen became members of the Polish Air Force, and four squadrons—two fighter (based on the Poznan and Warsaw air regiments) and two bomber—were setup. Some Polish airmen chose to stay with their British squadrons. 

The first squadrons were 300 and 301 bomber squadrons and 302 and 303 fighter squadrons. The fighter squadrons, flying the Hawker Hurricane, first saw action in the third phase of the Battle of Britain in late August 1940, quickly becoming highly effective. Polish flying skills were well-developed from the invasion of Poland and being highly motivated by patriotism for revenge the pilots were regarded as fearless and sometimes bordering on reckless. Their success rates were very high in comparison to the less-experienced British Commonwealth pilots. The 303 squadron became the most efficient RAF fighter unit at that time, and RAF commanders protested when government censors refused to allow this fact to appear in the press. By late 1940 the American visitor Ralph Ingersoll reported that the Poles were &quot;the talk of London&quot; because of their victories. Although at first the Poles memorised basic English sentences to identify themselves if shot down over Britain to avoid being mistaken as Germans, Ingersoll wrote that such pilots returned with &quot;a girl on each arm. They say the girls cannot resist the Poles, nor the Poles the girls&quot;. Some British airmen resorted to faking Polish accents to be more successful with women. Bomber squadrons Nos. 300 and 301 started operations on 14 August 1940, attacking German invasion barges in French ports, and then attacking targets in Germany as a part of British bombing offensive.

Many Polish pilots flew in other RAF squadrons, usually given nicknames because, as Ingersoll wrote, &quot;the Polish names, of course, are unpronounceable&quot;. Later, further Polish squadrons were created: 304 (bomber, then Coastal Command), 305 (bomber), 306 (fighter), 307 (night fighter), 308 (fighter), 309 (reconnaissance, then fighter), 315 (fighter), 316 (fighter), 317 (fighter), 318 (fighter-reconnaissance) and 663 (air observation/artillery spotting). The fighter squadrons initially flew Hurricanes, then Supermarine Spitfires, and eventually some were equipped with North American Mustangs. Night fighters used by 307 were the Boulton-Paul Defiant, Bristol Beaufighter and the de Havilland Mosquito. The bomber squadrons were initially equipped with Fairey Battles and Vickers Wellingtons, then Avro Lancasters (300 sqn), Handley Page Halifaxs and Consolidated Liberators (301 sqn) and de Havilland Mosquitos and North American Mitchells (305 sqn). 663 flew Auster AOP Mk Vs.

On April 6, 1944, a further agreement was reached and the Polish Air Forces in Great Britain came under Polish command, without RAF officers. This resulted in the creation of a dedicated Polish Air Force staff college at RAF Weston-super-Mare, which remained open until April 1946.

After the war, in a changed political situation, their equipment was returned to the British. Due to the fact that Poland ended the war under Soviet occupation, only a small proportion of the pilots returned to Poland where they suffered from harassment, while the rest chose to exercise their new found right to remain in Britain post war as detailed in the UK Polish Resettlement Act 1947, in doing so they remained exiled from their native country.

A memorial to those Polish pilots killed while on RAF service was erected in 1948 at the south-eastern corner of RAF Northolt aerodrome. On the public highway, it is accessible without entering RAF areas. It is adjacent to the A4180 junction on the A40 Western Avenue; the official name for this junction is &quot;Polish War Memorial&quot;. A large memorial to Polish Air Force squadrons in the war is situated on the floor of the north aisle of the reconstructed Wren church, St Clement Danes, London.

The Polish-American fighter ace Francis S. &quot;Gabby&quot; Gabreski flew his first combat missions attached to a Polish RAF squadron.

King George VI, on visiting a Polish squadron, asked a Polish airman what was the toughest thing he had to deal with in the war. The reply was &quot;King&#x27;s Regulations...&quot;

==Polish Volunteer Air Force squadrons&#x27; coats of arms==
When the Polish RAF squadrons were formed, a series of badges or coats of arms were designed for each of the Polish squadrons or flying units with the exception of 945 &amp; 929 Balloon Squadrons, 1586 Flight and 6(C) OTU.

Some of the squadron badges were based on squadron or escadrille badges of Polish flying units pre-1939 before the Second World War.

Some were long established such as 303&#x27;s Kościuszko badge and some were designed specially for the large and growing number of flying units being formed in the RAF.

* 300 Squadron&#x27;s badge has &quot;CCC&quot; meaning &quot;300&quot; in Roman numerals. It was the first Polish RAF squadron formed. It combines the coats of arms of both Poland and England – it has the Polish White Eagle &quot;Orzeł Biały&quot; (an eagle argent armed, crowned) and it has the English lion (a lion passant guardant, crowned).
* 301 Squadron was two separate squadrons with two different roles at different times and each used a different squadron badge. In July 1940, 301 Bomber Squadron was formed. It closed in March 1943 and most of their crews and aircraft were merged with 300 Squadron. The first 301 Bomber Squadron used an unofficial inverted pentagon badge with a white background and a Pomeranian red griffin rampant shield design, very similar to the coat of arms of Pomerania. The identical badge can be seen on photos of PZL.23 Karaś light bombers fighting against German invaders in September 1939. The new 301 Transport Squadron was formed in November 1944 and operated in North Africa and in Italy for Special Duties flights. It used a circular badge with a Polish Eagle, and below it – a Pomeranian red griffin passant shield – and a Maid of Warsaw &quot;Syrena&quot; shield, with the number &quot;301&quot; below. The use of the griffin refers to the earlier 301 Squadron, but it shows a griffin passant (walking) instead of the original griffin rampant.

* 302 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses an old Polish design previously used for 131 and 132 Escadrilles, the closest is the blue wings version of that badge from 132 Esc. The diamond shape badge includes a red, white and blue background from both the French and UK flags and it has both the French Armée de l&#x27;Air &quot;I/145&quot; unit number and &quot;302&quot;.
* 303 Squadron&#x27;s badge is the same as the older Polish &quot;Kościuszko&quot; unit, used for 111 Escadrille in the Brygada Poscigowa (Pursuit Brigade) tasked with the defence of Warsaw. But, in the RAF badge it has &quot;303&quot; added below.
* 304 Squadron&#x27;s badge shows a bomb and a &quot;V&quot; (&quot;Fifth&quot;) reference which could be for a Polish unit, or it may refer to the fact that 304 Sqn was the fifth unit both by numerical position (300–304) and it was the fifth Polish squadron formed by date, or it may refer to &quot;V for Victory&quot;.
* 305 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses a graphic image of a hussar&#x27;s wing, a letter &quot;P&quot; probably for Polska (&quot;Poland&quot;) and a spear signifying launched attack and the colour roundel of the RAF and the square roundel of the Polish Air Force. The squadron number &quot;305&quot; is added.
* 306 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses an old Polish design previously used for 141 and 142 Escadrilles. The main differences are: 141 &amp; 142 had an inverted hexagon, 306 uses a diamond shape. Also in the 306 badge there is a bear and tree, a symbol for Warwickshire, UK (and Madrid).
* 307 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses a crescent moon, an aircraft and an eagle owl derived from the heroic exploits of The Lwów Eaglets (Polish: Orlęta Lwowskie) young fighters who died defending the city of Lwow in Galicia, Poland from invading Ukrainian &amp; Russian forces during the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918–1919). The name &quot;Eagle Owls&quot; is also appropriate because 307 Squadron&#x27;s role was night-fighter defence.
* 308 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses an old Polish design previously used for 121 Escadrille. It uses the same emblem but facing the opposite way (right instead of left) and it is now enclosed in a diamond shape.
* 315 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses an old Polish design previously used for 112 Escadrille in the Brygada Poscigowa (Pursuit Brigade) tasked with the defence of Warsaw. The only difference is that it was rotated 30 degrees clockwise so the triangle is pointing down instead of left, with the bird more vertical and &quot;315&quot; was added.

* 316 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses an old Polish design previously used for 113 Escadrille in the Brygada Poscigowa (Pursuit Brigade) tasked with the defence of Warsaw. The only difference is that it was rotated 30 degrees clockwise so the triangle is pointing down instead of left, with the owl more vertical and &quot;316 SQ&quot; was added.
* 317 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses an old Polish design previously used for 151 and 152 Escadrilles in the pre-war Polish &quot;Narew Army Group&quot;. The blue version of that badge for 151 Esc. is closest to the 317 Sqn. badge.
* 318 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses the coat of arms of the City of Gdansk – a red shield with two white crosses and a golden crown above. The only additions are the golden wings surrounding the shield and the number &quot;318&quot; at the top.
* 663 Squadron&#x27;s badge uses the Polish red and white chequered square &quot;roundel&quot; set as a diamond with a Polish eagle flying and carrying an artillery shell. It has the letters &quot;DSA&quot; beside the number &quot;663&quot;.
Other squadrons:

* No. 138 Squadron including its &quot;Polish C Flight&quot; used the badge of the earlier RAF 138 Squadron which shows a sword cutting the reef-knot in a cord or rope, symbolising their role of liberating occupied territories during World War II.
* No. 302 Squadron inherited the traditions of previous Squadrons of the PAF such as III/3 Fighter Squadron, 131st Fighter Escadrille, Polish 132nd Fighter Escadrille and the French Armée de l&#x27;Air Groupe de Chasse G.C. I/145.
* No. 303 Squadron inherited the traditions and badge of previous Kościuszko Squadrons of the PAF such as the early Polish 7th Air Escadrille and 121st Fighter Escadrille and the later Polish 111th Fighter Escadrille.
* No. 317 Squadron inherited the traditions and badge of a previous Squadron of the PAF, the 151st Fighter Escadrille and 152nd Fighter Escadrille, part of the Narew (151) and Modlin (152) Independent Operational Groups respectively.
* No. 145 Squadron &quot;Polish Fighting Team&quot; uses a sphinx with a wing. It may have derived its badge and traditions via a Polish unit. The PFT squadron&#x27;s commander Stanislaw Skalski was a senior officer in III-4 Pomorze (Pomerania) Squadron during the 1939 invasion of Poland. The sphinx might be a reference to their being stationed in the Western Desert (and Egypt), the wing resembles the wings worn by 16th century Polish hussars.
Badges

In the Polish Air Force, their Air Force unit badges had two versions depending on which side of the aircraft they were painted, so that the emblem was always pointing or facing forwards. So on the port (left) side, the emblem faced left (forward) and on the starboard (right) side, the emblem faced right (forward).
For the RAF Polish squadrons, there was only one design with most facing left, but 308, 316 and 663 squadrons&#x27; emblems faced right.

<text>Frederick William Bell, VC (3 April 1875 – 28 April 1954) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Bell was born on 3 April 1875 in Perth, Western Australia, and was the first person born in Western Australia to receive the Victoria Cross.

He was 26 years old, and a lieutenant in the West Australian Mounted Infantry during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Following the end of the war, he went to the United Kingdom and received the decoration from the Prince of Wales during a large coronation parade of colonial troops in London on 1 July 1902.

Bell died on 28 April 1954, and was buried in Canford Cemetery, Bristol, England.

The Frederick Bell ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood was named in his honour.

==Medals==
The Western Australian Government bought Bell&#x27;s medals in 1984 from a stepson living in Canada, and the set was placed in the collection of the Western Australian Museum. In July 2016 the medals went on loan to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where they were on display until June 2019.

<doc id="1182747" wikidata="Q5342615" url="?curid=1182747" title="Edward Bellew">
<text>Edward Donald Bellew, (28 October 1882 – 1 February 1961, Kamloops, British Columbia), Captain of the 7th Bn British Columbia Regiment, CEF was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Bellew was born in Bombay, India, on 28 October 1882. He began his education at Blundell&#x27;s School, Devon, England, but left to attend Clifton College (1897–1900), from where he was admitted to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the Royal Irish Regiment in 1901. He emigrated to Canada in 1903 and worked as a construction engineer. In September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the British Columbia Regiment.

==Action==
Bellew was 32 years old, and a lieutenant in the 7th (1st British Columbia) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the Second Battle of Ypres, a mass attack on the Canadian line developed on the morning of Saturday 24 April 1915 near Keerselaere, Belgium. The Canadians were suffering heavy casualties. The advance of the enemy was temporarily stayed by Lieutenant Bellew, the battalion machine-gun officer, who had two guns in action on high ground when the enemy&#x27;s attack broke in full force. The reinforcements sent forward having been destroyed, and with the enemy less than away and no further assistance in sight, Bellew and a Sergeant Peerless decided to fight it out. The sergeant was killed and Bellew wounded. Nevertheless, he maintained his fire until his ammunition failed, when he seized a rifle, smashed his machine-gun and, fighting to the last, was taken prisoner.

==Later life==
Bellew remained a prisoner of war (latterly in Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp) until 1919, and achieved the rank of Captain. He subsequently returned to Canada and became a dredging inspector. He died in 1961 and is buried at Hillside Cemetery, Kamloops, British Columbia.

==Family==
Bellew was the second cousin of Robert Bellew Adams, VC.

==Loss of medal==
Bellew&#x27;s Victoria Cross is believed to have been stolen from the Royal Canadian Military Institute, Toronto, between January 1975 and 22 July 1977. It has never been recovered.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Philip Eric Bent (3 January 1891 – 1 October 1917) was a Canadian British Army officer recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Bent was born on 3 January 1891 in Halifax, Nova Scotia and was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh and Ashby Grammar School, Ashby de la Zouch. He joined the training ship in 1907. He served two years as a Cadet and then went to sea. He was taking his Merchant Navy officer&#x27;s ticket when the war broke out in 1914.

He and a friend joined a Scottish regiment &quot;for a bit of fun&quot; as the war was anticipated to be over by Christmas. He was commissioned in the Leicestershire Regiment, British Army, in November 1914.

Bent was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1917 Birthday Honours.

He was 26 years old, and Temporary Lieutenant Colonel commanding the 9th (Service) Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, during the First World War when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the VC on 1 October 1917 east of Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke, Belgium. He was killed whilst leading a charge. His citation reads:
He has no known grave and is commemorated on the memorial wall at Tyne Cot Cemetery, Belgium.
In 2015 a new road in Ashby de la Zouch was named &quot;Philip Bent Road&quot;; this is located approximately 0.6 miles west of the town centre off Moira Road (B5006).

Bent&#x27;s sword is displayed in All Saints Cathedral in his hometown of Halifax.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is held by his old school Ashby School but loaned to the Royal Leicestershire Regimental Museum (now part of Newarke Houses Museum). It is understood that the medal has been held in a Safe Deposit Box at a Leicester Bank where it has been kept for many years following the demise of the Museum.The contents of the Museum were transferred to Newarke Houses Museum, Leicester |url=https://www.memorialstovalour.co.uk/vc887.html|, The school proposed to auction his medals to raise funds for a sports pavilion, a decision which received widespread criticism. In May 2016 the school was unable to prove ownership. In 2018, a pavilion is set to be built following a funding bid to the Healthy Schools initiative.

<text>Crecchio is a &quot;comune&quot; and village in the province of Chieti, part of the Abruzzo region in central Italy. The village preserves its medieval aspect and is dominated by its castle. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;). Its main activities are agriculture and tourism, yet small family-run businesses exist.

==Geography==

Crecchio is located between the Adriatic coast and the pedemountain areas of the Maiella Mountain Massif. The Arielli and Rifago streams flow in the north west of the territory. These have cut deep valleys and have given rise to a hill with steep flanks, the top of which is occupied by Crecchio itself. In the south eastern areas, the landscape slopes towards the Moro stream.

Even though the area as a whole is dominated by hills and valleys, there are several flat areas within the boundaries of the commune. These include the areas Pietra Lata, Casone e Macchie near the provincial road &quot;Marrucina&quot; (ex SS 538), at Fonte Roberto and Ciaò (between Villa Mascitti and Casino Vezzani), in the areas surrounding Villa Tucci (Padule, Pozzo e Capo Lemare) and at S. Maria Cardetola. The elevation slowly decreases from southwest to northeast. The minimum elevation of above sea level is at Piano di Morrecine in the valley of the Arielli stream (northern areas) while the maximum elevation is at the old railway station near the border with the commune of Arielli.

==History==
Historical sources date Crecchio back to at least the 11th century, and archaeological evidence suggests it was inhabited at least as far back as the Roman era.

==Main sights==
The major building is the 12th-century castle which was converted to residential use in 1789. The castle became the family seat of the &quot;de Riseis&quot; family. The family were host to Prince Umberto in 1926 for one night of their honeymoon.

The castle was the site of an event during World War II when, on 10 September 1943, after the armistice, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy of Italy, in flight from Rome, spent a night in the castle before leaving Italy from the port of Ortona.

An Etruscan and Byzantine museum is located inside the castle.

==Economy==
The economy is mainly based on agriculture where vineyards and olive trees dominate the hills and valleys. The main vines grown are Montepulciano d&#x27;Abruzzo and Trebbiano. The first produces a dense red wine while Trebbiano grapes produce a rich white table wine.

The few business activities are mainly focused on the textile and mechanical industry.

<doc id="1182769" wikidata="Q2962362" url="?curid=1182769" title="Groudle Glen Railway">
<text>The Groudle Glen Railway is a narrow gauge railway near Onchan in the Isle of Man, on the boundary of Onchan and Lonan, which is owned and operated by a small group of enthusiastic volunteers and operates on summer Sundays; May to September and Wednesday evenings in July and August along with a number of annual special events.

==History==

; 1896 – 1939
The line was built in the late Victorian era to cater for a new demand for transport down Groudle Glen after the opening of the Manx Electric Railway. A zoo was built, and the Groudle Glen Railway connected to it. The narrow gauge line ran from the upper part of the glen, Lhen Coan, to the zoo at Sea Lion Rocks. The line opened on 23 May 1896 and initially operated with a single locomotive, called &quot;Sea Lion&quot;, and three coaches. The locomotive was built by W.G. Bagnall Ltd. of Castle Engine Works, Stafford. The line became so popular that a second locomotive, &quot;Polar Bear&quot; and additional coaches were purchased. The railway operated successfully until the outbreak of the First World War, when all services ceased and the zoo was closed. After the war, the zoo re-opened and the locomotives were overhauled and returned to service, but by 1921 they had been replaced with battery-operated locomotives. These proved unreliable and the original steam locomotives were again overhauled and returned to service. The railway closed again during the Second World War and the zoo closed for good. A landslide during the war years meant that services could not return to the original terminus.

; 1950 – 1981
The line took some time to re-open after the war; with the zoo closed, the glen was less frequently visited. Only one locomotive returned for the 1950 season. Over the next twelve years the seasons were of variable length and no timetable was officially issued. The final season was 1962, with &quot;Polar Bear&quot; by then inoperable. The final two seasons were known as the &quot;fairground era&quot; as the stock was painted in loud colours with blue and red dominating, and fairground-style lettering and lining applied to the locomotive. By the late 1960s the engines had been removed from the glen. &quot;Polar Bear&quot; was restored to working condition at Amberley Working Museum, West Sussex. &quot;Sea Lion&quot; went to Kirk Michael railway station on static display, before moving to Loughborough.

; 1982 – 1991
In 1982, the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters&#x27; Association launched a plan to restore the line, and work began clearing twenty years worth of undergrowth covering the trackbed. In December 1983, a short section from the old lime kiln to the headland opened, running Santa Trains. Further sections of the line were relaid, eventually reaching the glen terminus at Lhen Coan. A station was created at the headland with run-round facilities. The complete railway was officially re-opened on 23 May 1986 by Carolyn Rawson as part of the Manx Heritage Year and a tree planted to mark the event in Lhen Coan station. In September 1987, original steam locomotive &quot;Sea Lion&quot; returned to the railway after a full restoration. By 1991 it was decided to relay the final section of the line from the headland loop to the former terminus at Sea Lion Rocks. The run-round loop was lifted at the end of the 1991 season when the major earthworks began to relay the railway to the outer terminus.

; 1992 – 2002
The extension, recreating the line to its original three quarter-mile length, was opened on 23 July 1992, and in 1993 the distinctive Swiss-style station canopy at Lhen Coan, a feature of so many postcards of the glen, opened as part of the Year of Railways celebration. In 1993 &quot;Polar Bear&quot; also returned to the glen for a visit. It was a time of great change for the line, with many improvements being introduced by the volunteers. Visiting locomotives were a feature in 1995 (&quot;Chaloner&quot; and &quot;Rishra&quot;) and in 1998 as part of the Steam 125 event marking the anniversary of the island&#x27;s main railway. Planning permission was granted in 1999 for the volunteers to erect a replacement station building at Sea Lion Rocks, and by summer 2000 work was well in hand. The station building opened in 2001, and in 2003 the interior of the station was completed; this proved to be the major draw to the railway, aside from the unique steam locomotives. The station and surrounding area have since received much attention as ongoing projects, and the development of the site has also revived interest in the once popular zoo, whose remains can still be seen from the station site.

; 2003 – 2009
The addition of a replica battery electric locomotive in 2003 completed the line&#x27;s historical line-up of locomotives, and a return visit from &quot;Polar Bear&quot; for her own centenary in 2005 was repaid by &quot;Sea Lion&quot; making her first trip to Amberley Museum in the same year. In 2007 a new purpose-built locomotive shed was erected on the site of the original, but to a larger scale, and a mess hut was installed, which transformed the station at Lhen Coan, in keeping with the original site. In September 2007 a plaque was unveiled at Lhen Coan station to mark the 25th anniversary of the restoration. This event also marked the official opening by Annie Craine MHK of the railway&#x27;s new purpose-built locomotive shed. Plans were well in hand to rebuild the souvenir shop at Lhen Coan in a style similar to the distinctive station canopy, and in late 2008 the previous incarnation was dismantled in readiness for the erection of the new, pre-fabricated version on the same site. A mock signal box was also completed to cover the side of the volunteers&#x27; mess room, and by December 2008 work was in hand to close the shop for good after the Santa Trains. The new shop opened fully for Easter 2010 and now dominates the station site.

; 2010 – 
In 2010 an appeal was launched to raise the £60,000 required to extend the Sea Lion Rocks Tea Rooms to provide toilet facilities, a power supply and improved patio area. This was completed in time for the Easter 2012 services, and was re-opened by Allan Bell MHK, the island&#x27;s Chief Minister, in May 2012 to mark the 30th anniversary of the railway&#x27;s restoration. During the 2012 season planning permission was granted to enlarge the platform area at Lhen Coan station and to construct a new utility building to replace the time-expired tea hut, which was demolished after Christmas 2011. Construction work started in September, funded by the Manx Lottery Trust and Tower Insurance, and required the railway to transport 140 tons of rock to the site, for the platform extension foundations and infill. New stone faced walls to link the 2007 engine shed to the existing 1896 dry stone wall were also part of the project. The building was constructed by volunteer joiner Stephen Goody to match the style of the canopy, shop and booking office, and the entire area was completed in time for the Christmas services.

==Stations==

Despite being under one mile long, the railway does have intermediate stations, although only one of them is still operational for passengers and the other forms the site of the current passing loop when two trains are in operation (this was extended in 2011 to allow trains with more coaches to pass each other unhindered); the outer terminus is home to the visitor centre whilst the inner station houses all the running sheds and the railway&#x27;s workshops.

*Lhen Coan Station, the lower glen terminus, also the location of the railway&#x27;s loco and carriage works.
*, the only intermediate halt on the railway, the halfway point
*Headland Station, now closed, one-time terminus of the line prior to 1991
*, outer terminus on the cliffs above the old zoo

Each of the railway&#x27;s stations is now colour-coded, with all station furniture, waiting shelters, etc., in a corresponding scheme. The terminus at Lhen Coan is in brown and cream (similar to Great Western Railway stations), with Lime Kiln Halt in a green scheme (similar to the Southern Railway) and Sea Lion Rocks in a bright shade of red/maroon. In the past each station was decorated in a house style of deep brown and cream throughout the period 1991–2000, changing to individual station colour schemes thereafter, although individual shades used have varied since this time.

==Operations==

===Seasonal===
When it originally opened in 1896 the line ran a very intense all-day every-day service in season. A fourth coach was ordered within the first year to cope with demand, followed by a further locomotive and four coaches eight years later.

Today the railway operates to a set timetable annually with trains running every Sunday between May and September, with the first train at 11:00 am and the final departure at 4:30 pm. Additional evening services operate between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm on Wednesdays in July and August, and on Tuesdays in August only. One of the resident steam locomotives is in service wherever possible for each of the advertised operating days. When the line first re-opened services were also provided on bank holidays and public holidays, but this practice has been discontinued in more recent years. As part of the involvement with the Year of Railways in 1993 and subsequent anniversaries, the line has operated daily for periods of up to one week, the last being as part of Steam 125 in 1998 when visiting locomotives were in attendance. The railway&#x27;s current standard timetable can be found at its website including details of special services.

===Christmas===
The first services ever operated on the newly restored railway were the Santa Trains in 1983 which have since proved to be the highlight of the line&#x27;s calendar; they began life as one day of operation the weekend before Christmas Day but today these extend to two weekends of trains, which are the railway&#x27;s busiest period of year, culminating in the popular Mince Pie Trains which are a regular fixture each Boxing Day when many locals visit the line for a return journey and a seasonal drink and mince pie. The station at Lhen Coan is transformed into a grotto area for these services and the volunteers spend many hours preparing the site for the festive services. Until the arrival of Annie, one of the railway&#x27;s two diesel locomotives was renamed as &quot;Blitzen&quot; for the day, originally the traditional name of &quot;Rudolph&quot; was applied but this was changed in 1997 following requests. The services are now annually hauled by Sea Lion and Annie. Such is the continued success of these seasonal services that the railway introduced online pre-booking in 2010 for the first time, and now operate them over four days during the festive period.

===Easter===
Since the restoration of the railway began the line has always opened for the Easter weekend but the bunny trains only commenced in 1997 and were introduced following a request for them from the Isle of Man Hospice Care which has close ties with the railway, the train services being provided free of charge. However, following the success of the venture, the next year the railway embarked on its own special event operating the Easter Bunny Trains and they became an immediate success, with the full line being utilised (rather than the glen section which is used at Christmas). The railway usually operates a two train service, with trains passing at the headland loop, the Easter Bunny is on hand to distribute chocolate eggs at the outer terminus and free tea, coffee and orange is included in the ticket price along with entry to the Easter Egg Hunt. These services which operate on Easter Sunday and Monday are second only to the Santa Trains as the line&#x27;s busiest services.

===Jester Express===
As part of the railway&#x27;s fundraising drive for a new station building at Sea Lion Rocks terminus some special event days were run at weekends in either July or August, during the school summer holidays, for three years from 2000 to 2002. The outer terminus of the line at was transformed into an Arthurian themed area for the day, with two volunteers (acting as train guards) dressed as jesters, much to the amusement of the children, and a bouncy castle presided over by Merlin, and King Arthur in attendance to greet children; a set of stocks were the biggest draw for the children however, and these trains were very popular with local residents, with associated stalls, raffles and light refreshments being made available. A shortage of volunteer labour in subsequent years resulted in this innovative family day being dropped from the railway&#x27;s calendar, but the event returned for the 2010–2013 seasons... but has been dropped from the 2014 timetable as the special events calendar becomes more varied.

===Other events===

As part of a new drive to attract more local visitors to the line and to recruit new volunteers to run the line, a wide programme of special events were introduced for the 2010 season. Alongside the annual Easter Bunny Trains and Santa Specials, the Jester Express Fun Day returned in July, alongside the new Diesel &amp; Electric Day in May, the Father&#x27;s Day Trains in June and the Teddy Bear&#x27;s Picnic in August. The Teddy Bear&#x27;s Picnic wasn&#x27;t repeated due to competition from the Government railways own event not making it financially viable.
Another new initiative for 2010 was the introduction of Driver Experience sessions, bookable by the railway&#x27;s website, a 2-hour session on the footplate of locomotive Annie is offered as a hands on experience. Despite the level interest shown in the driver experiences, it was proving prohibitively costly and the sessions aren&#x27;t to be repeated in 2013.
A new special event for 2011 was the summer Cliff Top Concerts, supported by the Isle of Man Arts Council. A day of free open-air concerts from Manx groups and musicians were performed at Sea Lion Rocks, this event was deemed a great success and has been repeated every year since.
The 2013 season sees further development of the Special Events calendar with new events planned such as the Wag &#x27;n&#x27; Train with the Manx S.P.C.A., outdoor Church Services by the Sea and the &quot;Frocks on the Rocks&quot; with the Women&#x27;s Institute.

==Rolling stock==
===Locomotives===

The original steam locomotive &quot;Sea Lion&quot; remains in regular service. The railway also has two replica locomotives &quot;Brown Bear&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot;, three diesel locomotives and a replica battery electric locomotive. In the past there have been further locomotives, most notably &quot;Polar Bear&quot;, sister to &quot;Sea Lion&quot;, two original battery electric locomotives and several visitors.

Since restoration a number of visiting locomotives have operated on the line, including Kerr Stuart &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in 1991, &quot;Rishra&quot; and &quot;Chaloner&quot; from the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway in 1995 as part of the International Railway Festival in conjunction with the centenary of the Snaefell Mountain Railway, Quarry Hunslet locomotive &quot;Jonathan&quot; in 1998. &quot;Chaloner&quot; and the line&#x27;s other original locomotive, &quot;Polar Bear&quot; returned in 1993 as part of the Year of Railways. &quot;Polar Bear&quot; returned in 1996 for the railway&#x27;s centenary and again in 2005 for her own 100th birthday. Since being sold in 1996, &quot;Jack&quot; made one return visit in 1999.

===Carriages===
The railway originally had a total of eight four-wheeled coaches delivered in three batches; three were delivered in 1896 for the opening of the railway followed by one more soon afterwards to cope with passenger demand, and a further batch of four arrived in 1905 with the second locomotive. Several parts of these vehicles were saved from the site after closure, resulting in the ultimate restoration of many of the coaches both on the railway and off-island.

The restored railway now operates with a set of three bogie coaches built between 1985 and 1994 by the railway&#x27;s volunteers on two second hand underframes from Doddington and a new steel underframe constructed in 1993. The railway also has a restored set of four of the original four-wheeled toastrack coaches which are used for special services. In 2014 it was announced that the railway&#x27;s three main bogie coaches built in the 1980s/90s were becoming life-expired and beyond economic repair, so thanks to Lottery funding three new bogie coaches have been constructed on new frames and incorporate facilities for wheelchair passengers. These coaches came into service for Christmas 2014.

===Non-passenger stock===

The original line had no goods vehicles. At least one of the original four-wheeled toastrack coaches had its bodywork removed and was used to carry stock for the Headland Cafe below the line&#x27;s later terminus.

When restoration began a set of six &quot;bomb&quot; wagons from RAF Fauld were purchased, to help with track laying, though only five were used. All remained on site after reconstruction until 2011, when they were deemed beyond repair and scrapped, with the wheelsets retained. In 2012 two wheelsets were incorporated into a new-build, four-wheeled flat wagon nicknamed &quot;FAT 1&quot;, which was used as a base for the construction of &quot;Brown Bear&quot;.

After the 2014 bogie coaches entered service, the underframe from the old bogie coach 3 was converted into a flat wagon for use on works trains.

===Modern stock===
A series of four-wheeled and bogie flat wagons, a large second-hand four-wheeled brake van and a tipper wagon were acquired for maintenance work. To replace a variety of four-wheel wagons that were time-expired, a new bogie works van was delivered to the line in 2011 for use by permanent way crews. This features an open wagon and covered accommodation area.

As part of 1998&#x27;s Steam 125 celebration, the railway played host to a hand-made rail bike built by Dr Karl Pischl in Austria.

<text>James Bergin VC (29 June 1845 – 1 December 1880) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Bergin was 22 years old, and a private in the 33rd Regiment of Foot, (The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment from 1854), British Army during the Abyssinia Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 April 1868 in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), during the assault on Magdala, when the head of the column of attack was checked by the obstacles at the gate, a small stream of officers and men of the 33rd Regiment and an officer the Royal Engineers broke away from the main approach to Magdala, and, reaching the defences, climbed a cliff, forced their way over a wall and through a strong and thorny fence, thus turning the defenders of the gateway. The first two men to enter Magdala were Private Bergin and Drummer Michael Magner. 

He died at Poona British India on 1 December 1880.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regimental Museum in Bankfield Museum, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England.

<doc id="1182775" wikidata="Q642876" url="?curid=1182775" title="J. Carrol Naish">
<text>Joseph Patrick Carrol Naish (January 21, 1896 – January 24, 1973) was an American actor. He appeared in over 200 films during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

He became a dialect specialist, and was called upon to play character roles of many nationalities, including Southern European (especially Italian), Eastern European, Latin American, Native American, Middle Eastern, South Asian, East Asian, Pacific Islander—even African American, which earned him the moniker &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s one-man U.N.&quot; His own heritage was Irish but he rarely played Irish characters, explaining, &quot;When the part of an Irishman comes along, nobody ever thinks of me.&quot; 

Naish received two Oscar nominations for his supporting roles in the films &quot;Sahara&quot; (1943) and &quot;A Medal for Benny&quot; (1945), the latter of which also earned him a Golden Globe. He was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

==Early life==
Naish was born in New York City on January 21, 1896. According to the actor&#x27;s 1945 resumé, he was educated at St. Cecilia&#x27;s Academy in New York City, and appeared on stage in Paris and New York before beginning his screen career.

==Career==
Although he played an uncredited bit role in the silent film &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1926), Naish said his screen career didn&#x27;t actually begin until 1930, when stage actors were being recruited for the new talking pictures. He became a prolific supporting actor, appearing in more than 200 films. He was twice nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the first for his role as Giuseppe in the movie &quot;Sahara&quot; (1943), in which he delivers the propaganda speech: Mussolini is not so clever like Hitler, he can dress up his Italians only to look like thieves, cheats, murderers, he cannot like Hitler make them feel like that. He cannot like Hitler scrape from their conscience the knowledge right is right and wrong is wrong, or dig holes in their heads to plant his own Ten Commandments- Steal from thy neighbor, Cheat thy neighbor, Kill thy neighbor! But are my eyes blind that I must fall to my knees to worship a maniac who has made of my country a concentration camp, who has made of my people slaves? Must I kiss the hand that beats me, lick the boot that kicks me? NO! The second was for his performance as the title character&#x27;s Hispanic father in the movie &quot;A Medal for Benny&quot; (1945). For the latter film, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

He often played villains, from gangsters in numerous Paramount pictures to mad scientists, such as Dr. Daka in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; serial. In this screen adaptation of the comic book, Naish was originally cast as The Joker, but was recast as a Japanese supervillain suitable to the patriotic wartime plotline. 

In the 1940s Naish was a supporting character in a number of horror films. He played Boris Karloff&#x27;s assistant in &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944).

On radio, Naish starred as Luigi Basco on the popular CBS program &quot;Life with Luigi&quot; (1948–1953). &quot;Luigi&quot; popularity resulted in a CBS television series of the same name, with Naish reprising his role.

In 1955, Naish originated the role of Alfieri in the one-act, verse version of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; on Broadway, also starring Van Heflin and Eileen Heckart.

In 1957–1958, Naish played the lead role in the television series &quot;The New Adventures of Charlie Chan&quot;. Speaking in 2023, co-star James Hong said Naish had him fired from the series just because Hong had missed a single line, and accused Naish of having held &quot;a deep prejudice&quot;.

Naish worked mostly in guest roles on television through the 1960s; his most recent motion picture credit was from 1964. In 1971, the 75-year-old actor was coaxed out of retirement by producer and horror-film enthusiast Samuel M. Sherman to star in a new big-screen thriller, &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot; (1971). Naish played a descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein, who takes to murdering young women for experimentation in hopes of reviving his ancestor&#x27;s creation. His mute assistant was played by Lon Chaney Jr.. &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot; was the last film of both Naish and Chaney.

==Personal life==
Naish was married (from 1929 until his death) to actress Gladys Heaney; they had one daughter, Elaine.

Naish retired to San Diego and died of emphysema on January 24, 1973, at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, three days after his 77th birthday. He is interred at Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. For his contributions to television, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6145 Hollywood Boulevard.

Croydon South Primary School was built in 1967, and was located on Belmont Road West, Croydon South. In July 2008, it was proposed that Croydon South Primary School and Tinternvale Primary School merge and be located on the site of Tinternvale, due to falling enrolments at Croydon South. The merger occurred at the start of the 2009 school year. The Education Department agreed to a large increase in funding for the merger at the Tinternvale site and to bring the newly merged school into line with current standards. Following the merger, Tinternvale Primary School had around 410 students.

Croydon Special Development School serves students between 3 and 18 years old. As of 2017, there were 102 students enrolled.

<doc id="1182779" wikidata="Q938710" url="?curid=1182779" title="S. P. Somtow">
<text>S. P. Somtow (a rearrangement of his real name Somtow Papinian Sucharitkul; ; ; born December 30, 1952) is a Thai-American musical composer and conductor, and a science fiction, fantasy, and horror author writing in English as both Somtow Sucharitkul and S. P. Somtow. He has both Thai and American citizenship.

He served as a musical consultant on the Todd Field film &quot;Tár&quot;.

==Youth==
A descendant of the Royal Chakri dynasty (his grandfather&#x27;s sister was a cousin and consort of King Vajiravudh), Somtow was born in Bangkok. He moved to England with his parents in 1953 at the age of six months. English was his first language. Somtow was educated at Eton College and at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He returned to Thailand in the early 1960s for a five-year period, during which he became fluent in the Thai language. At age 11, he wrote a poem called &quot;Kith of Infinity&quot;, which was published in the English-language &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;. Shirley MacLaine saw it, and thinking that it was written by a dead poet, included it in her autobiography, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Off the Mountain&quot;. The poem contains the line &quot;I am not a man&quot;, as Somtow was not yet an adult. It is thought that this prompted MacLaine to assume that the author was a woman.

==Science fiction==
As a science fiction writer, Somtow is known for several series, among which are the &quot;Mallworld&quot;, &quot;Inquestor&quot;, and &quot;Aquila&quot; series. He first was published as Somtow Sucharitkul in the late 1970s in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Analog&quot; science fiction magazines. He wrote several stories and novels under that name before changing to the pen name S. P. Somtow.

==Horror==
He wrote &quot;Vampire Junction&quot; and a series of related novels and stories. He was president of the Horror Writers Association from 1998 to 2000. His other horror books include the werewolf-western novel &quot;Moon Dance&quot;, the zombie-American Civil War novel &quot;Darker Angels&quot;, and the collections &quot;Tagging the Moon: Fairy Tales of L.A.&quot; and &quot;The Pavilion of Frozen Women&quot;. In 1997, he wrote the juvenile vampire novel, &quot;The Vampire&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot;. He also wrote and directed the cult horror film &quot;The Laughing Dead&quot; and co-wrote the Roger Corman-produced &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Burial of the Rats&quot; (1995).

==Other literary works==
Somtow&#x27;s novel &quot;Jasmine Nights&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel set in Thailand in the 1960s, has become his best known fictional work. The historical fantasy &quot;The Shattered Horse&quot; holds that Hector&#x27;s son Astyanax survives the fall of Troy and grows to adulthood to meet many of the characters of the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

==Symphonic works==
He has also composed five symphonies and a ballet, &quot;Kaki&quot;. Other musical compositions include the “Requiem: In Memoriam 9/11,” commissioned by the government of Thailand as a gift for the victims of the 9/11 events and inspired by the poetry of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and T. S. Eliot.

==Stage works==
In 2000, he composed &quot;Madana&quot;, the first orchestral Western opera by a Thai composer and based on a Thai language play by King Rama VI. The opera was in English. His second opera on a Thai theme, &quot;Mae Naak&quot;, premiered in 2003 and a third opera, &quot;Ayodhya&quot;, was first performed in November 2006. His opera &quot;The Silent Prince&quot; was premiered in Houston by Opera Vista on October 15, 2010. A fifth opera, &quot;Dan no Ura&quot;, received its premiere in August 2014 in Bangkok.

In 2012, his musical &quot;Reya the Musical&quot;, based on a serialized novel by his mother which had already been made into a popular Thai TV soap opera, premiered at the Aksra Theatre in Bangkok and ran for twenty performances. A hybrid work combining ballet with opera, &quot;Suriyothai&quot;, based on the life of a Thai queen of the Ayuthaya period, premiered on August 23, 2013. A second musical was in the works afterward, titled &quot;Pob: The Musical&quot;, for December 2015 release.

In the 2010s, he was also at work on two more operas, one an adaptation of his fantasy short story &quot;The Fallen Country&quot; and another about the life of Holocaust survivor Helena Citrónová. &quot;The Snow Dragon&quot;, the adaptation of his fantasy story, was set to premiere March 13, 2015, at the Skylight Music Theatre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the baton of Viswa Subbaraman.

Somtow is artistic director of Opera Siam. In 2006, Somtow Sucharitkul conducted the first Wagner opera in Southeast Asia, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, as part of a five-year project to bring the entire Ring Cycle to Southeast Asia by 2010. Various delays afflicted the project and it has yet to resume. He has conducted the Thailand premieres of many key repertoire operas such as Thaïs, Otello, and The Rape of Lucretia. He embarked on a venture to conduct all of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies in Thailand, and the cycle was completed with No. 2 in 2015.

==Performing ensembles==
In the 1970s, Sucharitkul formed the Temple of Dawn Consort with Dnu Huntrakul and Bruce Gaston, an eclectic performing ensemble devoted to a fusion of Thai and Western music styles and instruments, performing music by these three composers. After his 1979 departure for the United States, the group evolved into other fusion ensembles, the most notable being Gaston&#x27;s Fong Naam. On his return to Thailand, Somtow founded, in addition to Bangkok Opera, the Siam Philharmonic Orchestra and the Siam Sinfonietta, a youth symphony orchestra. He also founded the Orpheus Choir of Bangkok, which travels all over Thailand and performs many of his pieces.

==Television animation==

Somtow has written episodes of the animated television series &quot;Dinosaucers&quot;, &quot;COPS&quot;, and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;.

==Politics and the 2006 SEA Awards speech==
When Nobel Prize laureate Wole Soyinka withdrew as keynote speaker at the 2006 SEA Write Awards ceremony in protest of the 2006 Thailand coup that ousted the elected government of Thaksin Shinawatra, Somtow, a critic of Thaksin, replaced Soyinka as keynote speaker. In his speech, Somtow berated Soyinka for boycotting the awards and claimed that in 50 years, he had never felt more free. Soon afterward, Somtow&#x27;s opera &quot;Ayodhya&quot; was censored by state officials under the junta, who claimed that the on-stage death of the demon-king, Thotsakan, would constitute a &quot;bad omen&quot; for the military junta. Somtow agreed to modify the scene and was forced to sign a document giving officials the right to &quot;immediately shut down the opera in mid-performance if, in their sole opinion, a breach of &#x27;tradition&#x27; occurs&quot;.

Somtow has since been critical of all sides in the political disputes following the coup. Although he was a critic of the populist government of Thaksin, Somtow stated in 2019: &quot;The righteous indignation of Thaksin&#x27;s opposition, however, went beyond the pale when they started to say that the poor shouldn&#x27;t vote because they&#x27;re too stupid.&quot; Somtow praised a speech by Democrat Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva for being &quot;so balanced, so reasonable, so intelligent, and so well thought through&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
As writer, Somtow won the John W. Campbell Award (Best New Writers) in 1981 for &quot;Sunsteps&quot;, the Locus Award (Best First Novel) in 1982 for &quot;Starship &amp; Haiku&quot;; the International Horror Guild Award (Long Fiction) in 1996 for &quot;Brimstone and Salt&quot;; the World Fantasy Award (Best Novella) in 2002 for &quot;The Bird Catcher&quot;, and has been nominated four other times; the HOMer Award; the American Horror Award; and several other awards. He has been nominated for two Hugos and five Bram Stokers. 

In 2008, he became one of the first recipients of the newly created Silpathorn Kittikhun Award, awarded by Thailand&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, for his combined literary and theatrical work and it profile within Thailand and internationally. This award has been viewed as an alternative to the more &quot;staid, traditional National Artist Awards&quot;. In December 2011, Thai newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot; selected him as one of the 40 most internationally acclaimed Thais.

In the theatrical realm more specifically, Somtow was awarded the 2013 Golden W award by the International Wagner Society for ten years of service in presenting the music of Richard Wagner in the region. In 2022, he won the Best Actor award at the first season of Casablanca Film Factory Awards for his performance in the film &quot;The Maestro: A Symphony of Terror&quot; directed by Paul Spurrier.

<doc id="1182783" wikidata="Q2062030" url="?curid=1182783" title="Southern Nigeria Protectorate">
<text>Southern Nigeria was a British protectorate in the coastal areas of modern-day Nigeria formed in 1900 from the union of the Niger Coast Protectorate with territories chartered by the Royal Niger Company below Lokoja on the Niger River.

The Lagos colony was later added in 1906, and the territory was officially renamed the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, Southern Nigeria was joined with Northern Nigeria Protectorate to form the single colony of Nigeria. The unification was done for economic reasons and the colonial administration sought to use the budget surpluses in Southern Nigeria to offset the deficit of administering the north.

Sir Frederick Lugard, who took office as governor of both protectorates in 1912, was responsible for overseeing the unification, and he became the first governor of the newly united territory. Lugard established several central institutions to anchor the evolving unified structure. A Central Secretariat was instituted at Lagos, which was the seat of government, and the Nigerian Council (later the Legislative Council), was founded to provide a forum for representatives drawn from the provinces. Certain services were integrated across the Northern and Southern Provinces because of their national significance—military, treasury, audit, posts and telegraphs, railways, survey, medical services, judicial and legal departments—and brought under the control of the Central Secretariat in Lagos.

The process of unification was undermined by the persistence of different regional perspectives on governance between the Northern and Southern Provinces, and by Nigerian nationalists in Lagos. While southern colonial administrators welcomed amalgamation as an opportunity for imperial expansion, their counterparts in the Northern Province believed that it was injurious to the interests of the areas they administered because of their relative backwardness and that it was their duty to resist the advance of southern influences and culture into the north. Southerners, on their part, were not eager to embrace the extension of legislation originally meant for the north to the south.

==Administration==

===Governors===
From its foundation, southern Nigeria was administered by a high commissioner. The first high commissioner was Ralph Moor. When Lagos was amalgamated with the rest of southern Nigeria in 1906, the then high commissioner Walter Egerton was made into Governor of the territory.

When in 1900 the protectorate passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, Ralph Moor became High Commissioner of Southern Nigeria and laid the foundations of the new administration, his health failing, he retired on pension on 1 October 1903.

Egerton became Governor of Lagos Colony, covering most of the Yoruba lands in the southwest of what is now Nigeria, in 1903. The colonial office wanted to amalgamate the Lagos Colony with the protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and in August 1904 also appointed Egerton as High Commissioner for the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He held both offices until 28 February 1906. On that date, the two territories were formally united and Egerton was appointed Governor of the new Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, holding office until 1912. In the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at Warri and an Eastern Province with capital at Calabar.

When his predecessor in Southern Nigeria, Sir Ralph Denham Rayment Moor, resigned, a large part of the southeast of Nigeria was still outside British control. On taking office, Egerton began a policy of sending out annual pacification patrols, which generally obtained submission through the threat of force without being required to actually use force.

When Egerton became Governor of Lagos he enthusiastically endorsed the extension of the Lagos – Ibadan railway onward to Oshogbo, and the project was approved in November 1904. Construction began in January 1905 and the line reached Oshogbo in April 1907.

He favoured rail over river transport, and pushed to have the railway further extended to Kano by way of Zaria.

He also sponsored extensive road construction, building on the legislative foundation laid by his predecessor Moor which enabled use of unpaid local labour.

Egerton shared Moor&#x27;s views on the damage that was being done to the Cross River trade by the combination of indigenous middlemen and traders based in Calabar. The established traders at first got the Colonial Office to pass rules inhibiting competition from traders willing to set up bases further inland, but with some difficulty, Egerton persuaded the officials to reverse their ruling.

Egerton was a strong advocate of colonial development. He believed in deficit financing at certain periods of a colony&#x27;s growth, which was reflected in his budgets from 1906 to 1912. He had a constant struggle to obtain approval for these budgets from the colonial office.

As early as 1908, Egerton supported the idea of &quot;a properly organized Agricultural Department with an energetic and experienced head&quot;, and the Department of Agriculture came into being in 1910.

Egerton endorsed the development of rubber plantations, a concept familiar to him from his time in Malaya, and arranged for land to be leased for this purpose. This was the foundation of a highly successful industry.
He also thought there could be great potential in the tin fields near Bauchi, and thought that if proven a branch line to the tin fields would be justified.

Egerton came into conflict with the administration of Northern Nigeria on a number of issues. There was debate over whether Ilorin should be incorporated into Southern Nigeria since the people were Yoruba, or remain in Northern Nigeria since the ruler was Muslim and for some time Ilorin had been subject to the Uthmaniyya Caliphate. There was argument about the administration of duties on goods landed on the coast and carried into Northern Nigeria. And there was dispute over whether railway lines from the north should terminate at Lagos or should take alternative routes to the Niger River and the coast.

Egerton had reason on his side in objecting to the proposed line terminating at Baro on the Niger, since navigation southward to the coast was restricted to the high-water season, and even then was uncertain.

Egerton&#x27;s administration imposed policies that tended towards segregation of Europeans and Africans.

These included excluding Africans from the West African Medical Service and saying that no European should take orders from an African, which had the effect of ruling out African doctors from serving with the army. Egerton himself did not always approve of these policies, and they were not strictly upheld.

The legal relationship between the Lagos government and the Yoruba states of the Lagos Colony was not clear, and it was not until 1908 that Egerton persuaded the Obas to accept the establishment of the Supreme Court in the main towns. In 1912, Egerton was replaced by Frederick Lugard, who was appointed Governor-General of both Southern and Northern Nigeria with the mandate to unite the two. Egerton was appointed Governor of British Guiana as his next posting, clearly a demotion, which may have been connected to his fights with the Colonial Office officials.

Lugard returned to Nigeria as Governor of the two protectorates. His main mission was to complete the amalgamation into one colony. Although controversial in Lagos, where it was opposed by a large section of the political class and the media, the amalgamation did not arouse passion in the rest of the country. From 1914 to 1919, Lugard was made Governor General of the now combined Colony of Nigeria. Throughout his tenure, Lugard sought strenuously to secure the amelioration of the condition of the native people, among other means by the exclusion, wherever possible, of alcoholic liquors, and by the suppression of slave raiding and slavery. Lugard ran the country with half of each year spent in England, distant from realities in Africa where subordinates had to delay decisions on many matters until he returned, and based his rule on a military system.


==Economy==

===Colonial economic policy===
The British economic policy for Africa at the time was founded on the belief that if African peoples were brought to embrace European civilisation with its emphasis on law and order their economic resources would be more effectively and thoroughly exploited to the benefit of all. It was optimistically and simplistically believed that the problem of African economic development was largely the problem of law and order; that once the slave trade was suppressed the chaos and anarchy believed to be the bane of life in Africa would disappear and African endeavour would be channelled to the collection of the national produce of the tropical forest for the satisfaction of European needs. The view came to be held that Africans by themselves were incapable of maintaining law and order to the level needed to bring about the much-desired economic revolution and that only European rule could do it.

It was not enough for the colonial power to impose and maintain law and order though. It was also necessary to promote and develop free movement and natural growth and trade. Also it was the generally accepted assumption that the economic efforts and products of a colony should supplement, rather than compete with or undermine, the economic efforts and products of the metropolitan country. This was a survival of the mercantilist system which had come to grief in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.

<text>John Hutton Bisdee, (28 September 1869 – 14 January 1930) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and family==
Bisdee was born on 28 September 1869 at Hutton Park, Melton Mowbray, Tasmania. He was educated at The Hutchins School in Hobart.

In 1904 he married Georgiana Thodosia Hale who was the daughter of Bishop Matthew Blagden Hale.

==Military service==
When Bisdee was 30 years old, and a trooper with the Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen during the Second Boer War, the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC.
:On 1 September 1900 near Warmbad, Transvaal, South Africa, Trooper Bisdee was one of an advance scouting party passing through a narrow gorge, when the enemy suddenly opened fire at close range and six out of the party of eight were wounded, including two officers. The horse of one of the wounded officers bolted and Trooper Bisdee dismounted, put the officer on his own horse and took him out of range of the very heavy fire.

Bisdee returned to Tasmania in 1902, and received the Victoria Cross from the Governor during a review in Hobart on 11 August 1902 to mark the coronation of King Edward VII.

He later served as a lieutenant colonel in the First World War, where he was awarded an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), as well as being Mentioned in Despatches.

==Later life==
He died on 14 January 1930 and was buried in the St James Churchyard, Jericho, Tasmania. His Victoria Cross is on display at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart.

<text>Thomas Willoughby Newton (January 18, 1804 – September 22, 1853) was a Whig member of the United States House of Representatives from the State of Arkansas.

Newton was born in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1804. Newton had little schooling in his early years but had great penmanship. He came to Arkansas in 1820 began his career as a post rider from Arkansas Post on the north side of the Arkansas river to Cadron. In 1825 he became clerk of the court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, and served for four years, During this time he studied law with Robert Crittenden and had become a lawyer. While living with Crittenden as an associate, Crittenden would revive many letters of disdain, and with that Newton strongly defended him. He was adjutant to Crittenden at the November 15th 1824 treaty with the Quapaws, and aide-de-camp to General William Bradford (1771–1826) in 1826. In 1829 he went to Shelbyville, Kentucky, and married Mary K. Allen, daughter of Colonel John Allen, veteran of the war of 1812. Newton remained at Shelbyville practicing law until 1837. After the admission of Arkansas to the Union, Newton brought his wife back to Arkansas, making it his home. He was elected as a Whig to the fifth State legislature and served in the Senate from November 4, 1844, to November 4, 1848. When Archibald Yell resigned his seat in Congress to become colonel of the Arkansas volunteer regiment in the Mexican–American War in 1847, Newton was elected to fill the unexpired term and served as a Whig in the Twenty-ninth Congress. This election made Newton the only person ever elected to the U.S. House from Arkansas as a Whig. Newton served in Washington for only a month, and declined to run for a full term. on September 22, 1853, at the age of 49, Newton died in New York City and is buried in the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock. Newton County, Arkansas, was named in his honor.

Newton was a slaveholder.

<text>The Marder I &quot;Marten&quot; (Sd.Kfz. 135) was a German World War II tank destroyer, armed with a 75 mm Pak-40 anti-tank gun. Most Marder Is were built on the base of the &quot;Tracteur Blindé&quot; 37L (Lorraine), a French artillery tractor/armoured personnel carrier of which the Germans had acquired more than 300 units after the Fall of France in 1940.

==History==
From the early stages of Operation Barbarossa the Wehrmacht became aware that their ability to combat some of the Soviet tanks was inadequate. The lighter tanks then in general service, such as the Panzer II and the Czech built 38(t), were under-armoured and did not mount an adequate gun to deal with the newer Soviet tanks. In addition, the standard towed anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht, the 37 mm 3.7 cm Pak 36, was both difficult to get into position quickly and lacked the ability to penetrate the heavy sloped armour of the new Soviet tanks. What was needed was a more powerful anti-tank gun that was mobile. The Germans possessed such a gun in the 75 mm 7.5 cm Pak 40. They also had come into possession of a large number of captured Soviet 76 mm F-22 Model 1936 divisional field guns. The Germans had experience in taking the chassis of an under-gunned tank to provide mobility to a heavier gun. The &quot;Panzerjäger I&quot; is such an example, where the turret was removed for an open conversion to allow the gunners the necessary room to operate the gun.

With the shock of having units overrun by new Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV-1 heavy tanks, the need for a heavier-gunned German tank became urgent. As an interim solution, it was decided to use captured French vehicles such as the Lorraine, and less effective German tanks such as the Panzer II and Panzer 38(t) as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the &quot;Marder&quot; series, comprising the Marder I, Marder II, and Marder III respectively. These vehicles provided mobility to either the 7.62 cm Pak 36(r) (a conversion of the 76 mm F-22 Model 1936) gun or in later versions the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun. Due to the weight and space constraints of the small chassis, the &quot;Marder&quot; series were not fully armoured. Thin upper armour protection was provided only for the front and sides against shrapnel and small arms only. All &quot;Marder&quot; series had open tops. Some were issued with canvas covers to protect the crew from the elements. The Marder series were not a proper that could exchange fire with enemy tanks.

==Development==

The &quot;Marder&quot; I was developed in May 1942 by Major Alfred Becker. It carried the 75 mm Pak 40 anti-tank gun on a Lorraine chassis. As the gun was relatively large, the original crew compartment superstructure was removed to create the space needed to work the gun. This was done by &quot;Baukommando Becker&quot;, an organization in occupied France converting French armoured fighting vehicles for internal security use. The gun was then mounted atop the chassis. Alkett, working in conjunction with Becker, produced the angled armour shielding for the crew compartment. The shielding was relatively light, and was open from above. The shielding provided the crew with protection from blast and small arms fire, but was not intended to stop armour piercing rounds. The vehicle&#x27;s primary function was to provide mobility to the anti-tank gun. It was not intended as a replacement for a tank.

In July and August 1942, 170 &quot;Marder&quot; Is were built on the Lorraine chassis. Later, two other French tanks were also used as the conversion base for the &quot;Marder&quot; I, these were the Hotchkiss H39 and FCM 36, (other French tanks like the Renault R35 were also used as a base for new tank destroyers but these were not called &quot;Marder&quot; I). The new conversions were also completed in 1942 by &quot;Baukommando Becker&quot; at the Hotchkiss plant on the outskirts of Paris, 24 Hotchkiss tanks were converted as well as 10 from the FCM 36. The Marder Is initially served in infantry divisions on the Eastern Front and met with good success. They later made up a significant component of the armoured fighting vehicles of the reformed 21st Panzer Division in Normandy.

==Combat history==

The first Lorraine-based &quot;Marder&quot; I vehicles were sent to the Eastern Front in 1942 to serve in the &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; (tank destroyer) units of infantry divisions.

This is a list of Infantry Divisions operating on the Eastern Front known to have used &quot;Marder&quot; Is and the estimated time frame they were used

&quot;On 14 August 1942, ... Gen.Qu. was requested to include 72 - 7.5cm Pak40 (Marder I) Lorraine on Blitztransport trains.&quot; (6 initially noted divisions issued 9 and then 10 Marder I &quot;in accordance with K.St.N.1148a dated 15Feb42 for a Panzerjäger-Kompanie (9 Sfl.)&quot; then &quot;10 7.5cm Pak40/1 auf Sfl. Lorraine-Schlepper and organized in accordance with K.St.N.1148a dated 1Dec42.&quot; 
Alfred Becker notes: &quot;By Christmas 1942 almost all of Becker’s men had reached Paris. In exchange for the men Becker provided the commander of the 227th Infantry Division with 20 of his armoured vehicles.[22]&quot;. This follows on from the ground breaking pre-Pz. div. developmental use of the Becker&#x27;s first conversion vehicles: 12x 10.5 cm leFH 16 Geschützwagen Mk VI 736 (e) &amp; six of the larger 15 cm sFH13 guns on Mk VI 736(e) by the 227th Inf. Div.

&quot;Two additional leFH18/4 (Sf.) mounted on Lorraine Schlepper chassis were completed with a modified superstructure (similar in design and purpose to the 38t Grille sIG 33, with an additional 12 built for and used by the 2 PzGren Regts of 21 Pz. div.) and delivered in early December 1942 as a new Sturmgeschütz-Zug for the 15.Batterie/Artillerie-Regiment 227.&quot; (Of 227th Inf.Div.).

&quot;An additional 64 sFH13 (after the first 30 built in June 42 and shipped to Rommel) were mounted on Lorraine-Schlepper chassis at Wa A Paris in July and August 1942. Gepanzerte Artillerie-Regiment 1 (Sfl) and 2 (Sfl) were each issued 30 sFH14 auf Sfl. To fill their five batteries.&quot;.

<text>General James Blair (27 January 1828 – 18 January 1905) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth forces.

Blair was born in Neemuch, Gwalior State in India, the son of a captain in the Bengal Cavalry. He was commissioned into the 2nd Bombay Light Cavalry, Bombay Army in 1844, becoming a Lieutenant in 1848.

He was 29 years old, and a captain in the 2nd Bombay Light Cavalry during the Indian Mutiny when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC.
Blair served until the end of the Indian Mutiny, mainly in Central India, including the pursuit of Tatya Tope.

Continuing to serve in the Indian Army, Blair acted as Political Resident at Aden between 1882 and 1885 with the rank of brigadier-general. He was promoted major-general 1885, and in 1889 became a lieutenant-general and was appointed a companion of the Order of the Bath. He was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list in 1890. In retirement he was promoted general in 1894 and appointed colonel of the 32nd Lancers in 1904.

Blair died at his home in Melrose Roxburghshire in January 1905, age of 76 and was buried at Trinity Churchyard, Melrose.

He was the cousin of Captain Robert Blair, who also won the VC in the Indian Mutiny.

<doc id="1182803" wikidata="Q4798023" url="?curid=1182803" title="Arthur Blackburn">
<text>Brigadier Arthur Seaforth Blackburn, (25 November 1892 – 24 November 1960) was an Australian soldier, lawyer, politician, and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for valour in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. A lawyer and part-time soldier prior to the outbreak of World War I, Blackburn enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in August 1914, and was assigned to the 10th Battalion. His unit landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on April 25, 1915, and he and another scout were credited with advancing the furthest inland on the day of the landing. Blackburn was later commissioned and, along with his battalion, spent the rest of the Gallipoli campaign fighting Ottoman forces.

The 10th Battalion was withdrawn from Gallipoli in November 1915, and after re-organising and training in Egypt, sailed for the Western Front in late March 1916. It saw its first real fighting in France on 23 July during the Battle of Pozières, part of the Battle of the Somme. It was during this battle that Blackburn&#x27;s actions resulted in a recommendation for his award of the VC. Commanding 50 men, he led four separate sorties to drive the Germans from a strong point using hand grenades, capturing of trench. He was the first member of his battalion to be awarded the VC during World War I, and the first South Australian to receive the VC. He also fought in the Battle of Mouquet Farm in August, before being evacuated to the United Kingdom and then Australia suffering from illness. He was medically discharged in early 1917.

Blackburn returned to legal practice and pursued a military career during the interwar period, and served as a member of the South Australian parliament in 1918–1921. He led the Returned Sailors&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Imperial League of Australia in South Australia for several years, and was appointed the coroner for the city of Adelaide, South Australia. After the outbreak of World War II, Blackburn was appointed to command the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion of the Second Australian Imperial Force, and led it during the Syria–Lebanon Campaign against the Vichy French in 1941, during which he personally accepted the surrender of Damascus. In early 1942, his battalion was withdrawn from the Middle East and played a role in the defence of Java in the Dutch East Indies from the Japanese. Captured, Blackburn spent the rest of the war as a prisoner-of-war. After he was liberated in 1945, he returned to Australia and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services on Java in 1942.

Following the war, Blackburn was appointed as a conciliation commissioner of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration until 1955 and in that year was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for his services to the community. He died in 1960 and was buried with full military honours in the Australian Imperial Force section of the West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide. His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.

==Early life==

Arthur Seaforth Blackburn was born on 25 November 1892 at Woodville, Colony of South Australia. He was the youngest child of Thomas Blackburn, an Anglican canon and entomologist, and his second wife, Margaret Harriette Stewart, Browne. Arthur was initially educated at Pulteney Grammar School. His mother died in 1904 at the age of 40. He studied at St Peter&#x27;s College, Adelaide from 1906-1909 followed by studies at the University of Adelaide, where he completed a Bachelor of Laws in 1913, after being articled to C.B.Hardy. During Blackburn&#x27;s term as his articled clerk, on one occasion Hardy was assaulted by two men on the street, and despite his slight build, Blackburn intervened and chased them away. In 1911, compulsory military training had been introduced, and Arthur had joined the South Australian Scottish Regiment of the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). He was called to the bar on 13 December 1913. His half-brother, Charles Blackburn, became a prominent Sydney doctor, served in the Australian Army Medical Corps in World War I, and later became a long-serving Chancellor of the University of Sydney. Their father died in 1912. At the outbreak of World War I, Arthur was practising as a solicitor in Adelaide with the firm of Nesbit and Nesbit, and was still serving in the CMF.

==World War I==

===Gallipoli===

On 19 August 1914, aged 21, Blackburn enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was assigned to the 10th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. The 10th Battalion underwent initial training at Morphettville in Adelaide, South Australia, before embarking on at nearby Outer Harbor on 20 October. Sailing via Fremantle and Colombo in Ceylon, the ship arrived at Alexandria, Egypt, on 6 December. The troops went into camp near Cairo. They trained there until 28 February 1915, when they moved to Alexandria. They embarked on on 1 March and a few days later arrived at the port of Mudros on the Greek island of Lemnos in the northeastern Aegean Sea, where they remained aboard for the next seven weeks.

The 3rd Brigade was chosen as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April, which marked the commencement of the Gallipoli campaign. The brigade embarked on the battleship and the destroyer , and after transferring to strings of rowing-boats initially towed by steam pinnaces, the battalion began rowing ashore at about 04:30. Blackburn was one of the battalion scouts, and among the first ashore.

Australia&#x27;s World War I official war historian, Charles Bean, noted there was strong evidence that Blackburn, along with Lance Corporal Philip Robin, probably made it further inland on the day of the landing than any other Australian soldiers whose movements are known, some . The 3rd Brigade covering force fell well short of its ultimate objective, the crest of a feature later known as &quot;Scrubby Knoll&quot;, part of &quot;Third (or Gun) Ridge&quot;, but Blackburn and Robin, who were sent ahead as scouts, got beyond it. Robin was killed in action three days after the landing. Later in life, Blackburn was modest and retiring about his and Robin&#x27;s achievement, stating that it was &quot;an absolute mystery&quot; how they had survived, given the range at which they were being shot at and the men who were shot around them.

Blackburn participated in heavy fighting at the landing; by 30 April, the 10th Battalion had suffered 466 killed and wounded. He was soon promoted to lance corporal, and was placed in charge of the unit post office for one month shortly after his promotion. He was involved in subsequent trench warfare defending the beachhead, including the Turkish counter-attack of 19 May. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 4 August, and appointed as a platoon commander in A Company. Blackburn served at the front for the rest of the campaign, until the 10th Battalion was withdrawn to Lemnos in November, and subsequently back to Egypt. The battalion suffered over 700 casualties during the campaign, including 207 dead. The unit underwent re-organisation in Egypt, and on 20 February 1916, Blackburn was promoted to lieutenant. In early March, he was hospitalised for two weeks with neurasthenia. The battalion sailed for France in late March, arriving in early April. By this time, Blackburn was posted to a platoon in D Company.

===Western Front===

Blackburn went on leave in France from 29 April to 7 May. The 10th Battalion entered the fighting on the Western Front in June, initially in the quiet Armentières sector of the front line. While in this area, Blackburn was selected as a member of a special raiding party led by Captain Bill McCann. In the early hours of 23 July, the 10th Battalion was committed to its first significant action on the Western Front during the Battle of Pozières, part of the Battle of the Somme. Initially, A Company under McCann were sent forward to assist the 9th Battalion, which was involved in a bomb (hand grenade) fight over the O.G.1 trench system. Held up by heavy machine gun fire and bombs, McCann, who had been wounded in the head, reported to the commanding officer (CO) of the 9th Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel James Robertson, that more help was needed. About 05:30, a detachment of 50 men based on 16 Platoon, D Company, 10th Battalion, was then sent forward under Blackburn to drive the Germans out of a section of trench. Blackburn, finding that A Company had suffered heavy casualties, immediately led his men in rushing a barricade across the trench. Breaking it down, and using bombs, they pushed the Germans back. Beyond this point, preceding artillery bombardments had almost obliterated the trench, and forward movement was exposed to heavy machine gun fire.

Blackburn, along with a group of four men, crawled forward to establish the source of the German machine gun fire, but all four of the men were killed, so he returned to his detachment. He went back to Robertson, who arranged support from trench mortars. Under the cover of this fire, Blackburn again went forward with some of his men, but another four were killed by machine gun fire. Another report to Robertson resulted in artillery support, and Blackburn was able to push forward another before being held up again, this time by German bombers. Under cover from friendly bombers, Blackburn and a sergeant crawled forward to reconnoitre, establishing that the Germans were holding a trench that ran at right angles to the one they were in. Blackburn then led his troops in the clearing of this trench, which was about long. During this fighting, four more men were killed, including the sergeant, but Blackburn and the remaining men were able to secure the trench and consolidate. Having captured the trench, Blackburn made another attempt to capture the strong point that was the source of the machine gun fire, but lost another five men. He, therefore, decided to hold the trench, which he did until 14:00, when he was relieved. By this time, forty of the seventy men that had been under his command during the day had been killed or wounded. Sometime that night, Blackburn took over command of D Company, but was relieved the following morning.

For his actions, Blackburn was recommended for the award of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. Describing his actions in a letter to a friend, the normally retiring Blackburn said it was, &quot;the biggest bastard of a job I have ever struck&quot;. In recommending him for the VC, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Price Weir, observed, &quot;Matters looked anything but cheerful for Lieutenant Blackburn and his men, but Blackburn lost neither his heart nor his head&quot;.

The 10th Battalion was relieved from its positions at Pozières in the late evening of 25 July, having suffered 327 casualties in three days. Blackburn was temporarily promoted to the rank of captain on 1 August, due to the heavy losses. The battalion spent the next three weeks in rest areas, but returned to the fighting during the Battle of Mouquet Farm on 19–23 August, incurring another 335 casualties from the 620 that were committed to the fighting. Following this battle, the 10th Battalion went into rest camp in Belgium, and on 8 September, Blackburn reported sick with pleurisy and was evacuated to the 3rd London General Hospital. He relinquished his temporary rank upon evacuation, and was placed on the seconded list. Blackburn&#x27;s VC citation was published on 9 September, and read:

Blackburn was the first member of the 10th Battalion and first South Australian to be awarded the VC, and his VC was earned in the costliest battle in Australian history. He was discharged from hospital on 30 September, and attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 4 October to receive his VC from King George V. The same day, McCann received the Military Cross for his own actions at Pozières that immediately preceded those of Blackburn. Blackburn embarked at Southampton for Australia aboard the hospital ship &quot;Karoola&quot; on 16 October for six months&#x27; rest, arriving home via Melbourne on 3 December. The train he arrived on was met by the state premier, Crawford Vaughan, but he declined to speak to the assembled crowd about his exploits. The following day he was fêted by the staff and students of St Peter&#x27;s College.

He married Rose Ada Kelly at the St Peter&#x27;s College chapel on 22 March 1917; they had two sons and two daughters. Their sons were Richard and Robert; Richard also became a lawyer and eventually became an eminent jurist, chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and chancellor of the Australian National University. His daughter Margaret married Jim Forbes, who became a long-serving federal government minister, and his other daughter Rosemary became a literary editor, author, and adviser to the South Australian government on women&#x27;s affairs. Blackburn was discharged from the AIF on medical grounds on 10 April 1917, as he was classified as too ill to return to the fighting. He was awarded an invalid soldier&#x27;s pension. In addition to his VC, Blackburn also received the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I. His brothers Harry and John also served in the AIF during the war.

==Between the wars==

Blackburn returned to legal practice in early 1917, becoming a principal lawyer for the firm of Fenn and Hardy. In May 1917, Blackburn was elected as one of five vice-presidents of the Returned Soldiers&#x27; Association (RSA) in South Australia, which was led by the first commanding officer of the 10th Battalion, Weir. On 12 September, Blackburn was elected state president of the RSA. He was involved in the 1917 Australian conscription referendum campaign, advocating in favour of conscription. As RSA president, he was involved in advocating for returned soldiers, and navigated a contentious period in the organisation&#x27;s history. He also led the fundraising for a soldiers&#x27; memorial to be built in Adelaide. In January 1918, he was re-elected unopposed as president.

Despite his push for the RSA to remain independent of politics, in early April 1918, Blackburn successfully contested the three-member South Australian House of Assembly seat of Sturt as a National Party candidate, and on 6 April he was elected first of the three with 19.2 per cent of the vote. As a parliamentarian, Blackburn&#x27;s speeches were generally about issues affecting those still serving overseas, as well as returned soldiers. A notable exception was his successful motion in favour of a profit-sharing system for industrial employees. He advocated several radical ideas in his time as a parliamentarian, including removing all single men from the state public service so they would be free to enlist. He was also criticised in Parliament for not paying due attention to important legislation regarding ex-soldiers. This criticism even extended to attacks from another AIF man, Bill Denny, from the opposition Australian Labor Party (ALP). According to his biographer Andrew Faulkner, his time in Parliament showed Blackburn to be a man of few words, but his words were chosen well and delivered with authority.

On 29 August 1918, he was appointed a justice of the peace, and in November, he became a Freemason with the St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Lodge. In July 1919, the Returned Sailors&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA), which had succeeded the RSA, held its annual congress in Adelaide. Among the motions that Blackburn moved was one calling on the federal government to ensure that a suitable headstone was erected over the grave of every sailor and soldier killed during the war. He also railed against delays in the deferred pay of dead soldiers being paid to their widows.

In January 1920, Blackburn was re-elected as state president of the RSSILA, although this was the first time he was opposed for the post, and he only won narrowly. By this time he had built the state branch of the organisation to 17,000 members. During that year, he hosted visits by two notables; Field Marshal William Birdwood, and the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII. In accordance with normal procedures, while serving in the AIF, Blackburn had been appointed an honorary lieutenant in the CMF on 20 February 1916 on the Reserve of Officers List. This appointment was made substantive on 1 October 1920, still on the Reserve of Officers List. Continuing to practise law while a member of Parliament made for a heavy workload, and Blackburn did not seek re-election in 1921. In the same year he relinquished his role as state president of RSSILA, but he continued to be a fierce advocate for returned soldiers.

On 30 October 1925, Blackburn was transferred as a lieutenant from the Reserve of Officers List to the part-time 43rd Battalion of the CMF. In the same year, along with McCann, he formed the legal firm Blackburn and McCann, continuing the association they had during the fighting at Pozières. On 21 February 1927, Blackburn was promoted to captain, still serving with the 43rd Battalion. In early 1928, Blackburn became a foundation member of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen; he later became its second president. In this role, he created a Junior Legacy Club for teenage sons of men who had died, which conducted activities such as camps and sports.

Blackburn was transferred from the 43rd Battalion to the 23rd Light Horse Regiment on 1 July 1928. In September and October 1928, Blackburn helped raise a volunteer force which was used to protect non-union labour in an industrial dispute on the wharves at Port Adelaide and Outer Harbor. Initially called the &quot;Essential Services Maintenance Volunteers&quot; (ESMV) then the &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Defence Brigade&quot;, the men of this organisation, armed with government-issued rifles and bayonets, were deployed by the South Australia Police to intervene in the dispute between union and non-union labour on the docks. There was no fighting between the force and the strikers, and the dispute was resolved by early October.

Following the amalgamation of light horse regiments, Blackburn was transferred to the 18th/23rd Light Horse Regiment on 1 July 1930, and to the 18th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment on 1 October of the same year. In 1933, Blackburn became the coroner of the city of Adelaide, a position he held for fourteen years, with leave of absence during his World War II service. In this role, he was criticised for refusing to offer public explanations for his decisions not to hold inquests; it was criticism he ignored. The ALP attacked Blackburn&#x27;s decision-making as coroner, according to Faulkner, this was probably influenced by his involvement with the ESMV in 1928 and his alignment with conservative politics. They were joined by the editor of &quot;The News&quot;, who ran several editorials criticising Blackburn. In his role, Blackburn often dealt with deaths of returned soldiers, and murders committed by them. On 6 May 1935, Blackburn was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. He was promoted to major on 15 January 1937, still with the same regiment, and in the same year was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal. On 1 July 1939, a few months before the outbreak of World War II, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed to command the 18th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment.

==World War II==

Blackburn stopped practising law in 1940, and on 20 June was appointed to raise and command the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion, part of the Second Australian Imperial Force raised for service overseas during World War II. He was one of only three Australian World War I VC recipients to volunteer for overseas service in World War II. Eleven of the officers selected by Blackburn for his new unit were former officers of the 18th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment, including the battalion second-in-command, Major Sid Reed, who was to prove valuable in moderating Blackburn&#x27;s temper at times. The unit was raised in four different states; headquarters and A Company in South Australia, B Company in Victoria, C Company in Tasmania and D Company in Western Australia. It concentrated in Adelaide on 31 October, after which Blackburn moulded the separately raised companies into one organisation. Multi-day route marches featured strongly in their training; Blackburn invariably marched at the front of his battalion. After undergoing training, the battalion entrained for Sydney where it embarked on on 10 April 1941. The battalion sailed for the Middle East via Colombo, where they had ten days&#x27; leave, and disembarked in Egypt on 14 May. Upon arrival, the battalion was assigned to the 7th Division in Palestine, where it underwent further training at a camp just north of Gaza.

===Syria–Lebanon campaign===

In mid-June, the battalion was committed to the Syria–Lebanon campaign against the Vichy French in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Due to the involvement of Vichy French and Free French troops on opposite sides, the campaign was politically sensitive and as a result of heavy censorship not widely reported in Australia at the time; the nature of the fighting, where it was reported, was also played down as the Vichy forces outnumbered the Allies and were also better equipped. The Allied plan involved four axes of attack, with the 7th Division committed mainly to the coastal drive on Beirut in Lebanon and the central thrusts towards Damascus in Syria. Blackburn initially divided his time between divisional headquarters in Palestine and the front, while three companies of the 2/3rd, along with a battery of anti-tank guns, were the only divisional reserve.

The 2/3rd were fully committed on 15 June, when the commander of I Corps, the Australian Major General John Lavarack, committed the divisional reserve to secure a bridge across the Jordan River and thwart a major Vichy French counter-stroke that threatened to derail the campaign. This involved a blacked-out night-time drive of at relatively high speed over rough and treacherous roads to the bridge; Blackburn drove in advance of his force. On arrival, he was ordered to detach one of his companies north to block the road from Metulla. Blackburn then led A Company on another drive before returning to check on the dispositions of his remaining troops at the bridge, near which he established his headquarters. Also on the 15th, D Company was detached from the battalion to support the coastal advance, and remained so throughout the campaign.

During the day a British staff officer arrived and directed Blackburn to send a company, two anti-tank guns and two armoured cars loaded with ammunition to Quneitra, which Blackburn understood to have surrendered to the Vichy French. Blackburn baulked at this further splitting of his force, but when the order was confirmed by higher headquarters, early on 16 June he sent the scratch force of around 200 men north. The force took up positions on a ridge overlooking the town, but soon gathered intelligence that 1,500 Vichy French were holding the town, supported by numerous tanks and armoured cars. Blackburn, very concerned about his vanguard, decided to go forward to the ridge himself to check on dispositions. In the meantime, the company commander in that location tried to coax the Vichy French tanks to within range of his anti-tank guns, to no avail. Prior to Blackburn&#x27;s arrival, a British battery of Ordnance QF 25-pounder field guns arrived. In a further effort to draw out the Vichy French, Blackburn personally drove his staff car forward and round in circles in an exposed position, but again the Vichy French did not take the bait. Late in the day, a battalion of British infantry arrived and, under covering fire from the machine gunners, attacked and captured the town; the 25-pounders knocked out three Vichy French armoured cars. Blackburn&#x27;s advance force had made a significant contribution to stopping the Vichy French counter-stroke.

Blackburn&#x27;s area of responsibility was briefly expanded to include all the routes east of the Jordan as far as Quneitra. To cover this he was allocated squadrons of light tanks and Bren carriers, as well as a British dressing station to handle casualties. On 19 June his force was ordered forward towards Damascus. This involved a drive to Sheikh Meskine then a journey north, which took nearly two days due to the state of the roads. Meanwhile, Blackburn was recalled to Rosh Pinna in Palestine to receive orders from the commander of the Damascus front, Major General John Fullerton Evetts of the British 6th Infantry Division, who directed him to assist the &quot;weary and disheartened&quot; Free French forward to Damascus. To achieve this task, his force was trimmed to a reinforced company of the 2/3rd and five anti-tank guns, totalling around 400 men. Blackburn arrived at Free French headquarters on 20 June, where he was told that their attack had faltered about south of Damascus.

On the left flank of the Free French force was the Australian 2/3rd Infantry Battalion, attacking from the southwest towards the town of Mezze to the west of Damascus. The planned Free French attack was scheduled to go forward at 17:00, but they did not move. Blackburn again drove forward, but the Free French again refused to budge. To get the attack moving, Blackburn ordered one platoon of machine gunners forward to a trench about closer to Damascus. The Vichy French did not fire on them, and the couple of Vichy French tanks that appeared were engaged with Boys anti-tank rifles. The Senegalese Free French troops then came forward to the Australian-held trench. Blackburn then ordered the rest of his men forward. This process, of the Australian machine gunners advancing and the Free French following, was repeated by Blackburn until the forward troops had advanced a total of and reached the outskirts of Damascus. In the latter stages, the Vichy French began to respond with small arms and artillery, and their tanks and snipers forced a halt for the night.

In the meantime, the 2/3rd Infantry Battalion had captured Vichy French positions to the west of Damascus and cut the road to Beirut. In the morning of 21 June, the Free French began to advance; Blackburn&#x27;s machine gunners supported them and protected their right flank in case of a Vichy French counter-attack from the east. About 11:00 a Vichy French column emerged from Damascus led by a car bearing a white flag. After some discussions, Blackburn accompanied the Vichy French and Free French back into the city, where Blackburn, as the senior Allied commander present, accepted the surrender. Meanwhile, the Vichy French thrust towards Metulla had not reached A Company, and on 16 June the company was ordered forward into support positions for an attack by the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion on a fort at Merdjayoun. Over several days, the pioneers, fighting as infantry, and the 2/25th Battalion were pitted against the well-held Vichy French positions, until the defenders withdrew on the night of 23 June.

In the short lull after the fall of Damascus, Blackburn&#x27;s men, less D Company, were scattered over a wide area of the central front supporting the infantry. Blackburn continued to visit his detachments, often displaying a disdainful attitude to incoming artillery fire which amazed his men. With the Vichy French stymied in the centre and the Allies unable to press forward from Damascus, the overall commander, now-Lieutenant General Lavarack, decided to put his main effort into the coastal push towards Beirut. D Company of the 2/3rd, split up among the various infantry battalions pushing up the coast road, fought at Damour in early July, before the Vichy French requested an armistice in mid-July. The battalion suffered 43 casualties during the campaign; nine dead and 34 wounded. At the end of July, Blackburn left the battalion to join the Allied Control Commission for Syria in Beirut, responsible, among other functions, for the repatriation of French prisoners-of-war (POW). He seconded several officers from the 2/3rd to help him, and travelled widely around Syria, and even managed a brief crossing into Turkey. He became involved in trying to arbitrate in the fractious relationship between the captured Vichy French and the Free French who wanted to recruit them, but the Free French were largely unsuccessful in this endeavour, with only 5,700 of the remaining fit 28,000 Vichy soldiers joining their cause.

In the aftermath of the campaign, the 2/3rd stayed on as part of the Allied occupation force established in Syria and Lebanon to defend against a possible drive south by Axis forces through the Caucasus. The battalion defended a position northeast of Beirut, around Bikfaya initially, but was moved around to various locations including Aleppo on the Turkish border throughout the remainder of 1941. They endured a bitter cold and snowy winter at Fih near Tripoli, which was punctuated by leave drafts to Tel Aviv. By this time, Blackburn had returned to the battalion after a stint as president of a court-martial and another inquiry, where his legal skills were put to good use. At Christmas, Blackburn&#x27;s son, Richard, visited him, on leave from the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment, which was in Palestine.

===Java===

On 14 January 1942, following Japan&#x27;s entry into the war, the 2/3rd left Fih and travelled south into Palestine. On 1 February, the battalion, less one company and with no machine guns or vehicles, left the Middle East on . Also on &quot;Orcades&quot; were the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, engineers of the 2/6th Field Company, elements of the 2/2nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment and 2/1st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, the 105th General Transport Company, 2/2nd Casualty Clearing Station, and sundry others. The ship, rated for 2,000 passengers, was loaded with 3,400. Blackburn, as senior officer on board, was appointed as the commander of the embarked troops, and ensured that the soldiers were kept busy with air raid and lifeboat drills, physical training and lectures. On 10 February, the ship departed Colombo, escorted by British, and later, Australian warships.

Blackburn received orders to put 2,000 of his men ashore at Oosthaven on Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies to help defend an airfield near Palembang, about north of the port. These men were to be known as &quot;Boostforce&quot;. This was in accordance with a plan that involved the 6th and 7th Divisions defending Java and Sumatra respectively. Due to a lack of small arms, some of the troops were equipped with weapons from &quot;Orcades&quot;″ armoury, including outdated and unfamiliar Springfield, Ross and Martini Henry rifles. Some soldiers did not have a firearm at all, and the 2/3rd not only lacked its Vickers guns, it also did not have any Bren light machine guns either. Blackburn was to lead &quot;Boostforce&quot;, the objective of which he labelled a &quot;suicide mission&quot;, especially given the Japanese had landed paratroops on Sumatra on 14 February. &quot;Orcades&quot; dropped anchor about offshore. Despite receiving a report that the Japanese were already at Palembang, Blackburn was ordered to disembark his force, and they were ferried ashore by a small Dutch tanker around dusk on 15 February. They were only just disembarking when orders were received to return to &quot;Orcades&quot;, as the Japanese were only away from Oosthaven. They were transported back to the ship in the dark, and they weighed anchor in the early hours of the following day. While they had been on their abortive mission, Singapore had fallen.

&quot;Orcades&quot; was escorted across the Sunda Strait, and about 14:00 on 16 February, it anchored in the outer harbour of Tanjung Priok, the port of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies. At noon the following day &quot;Orcades&quot; entered the port, which was gripped by considerable confusion. Australian looters and deserters from Singapore pelted &quot;Orcades&quot; with tins and other objects. Blackburn sent a party of pioneers ashore to round them up. He gave them the choice of either joining his force or being charged with desertion. Many joined, but their commitment to the force was questionable. The majority of the troops aboard &quot;Orcades&quot; remained on the ship throughout the rest of the day and all of the next. On 19 February, Blackburn received orders to disembark about 2,000 men, and after several false starts, they went ashore in the early evening.

On 21 February, Blackburn was temporarily promoted to brigadier and appointed to command all 3,000 Australian troops on Java, collectively known as &quot;Blackforce&quot;. Blackforce consisted of the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company (engineers), a platoon of over-age headquarters guards, 105th General Transport Company, 2/3rd Reserve Motor Transport Company, 2/2nd Casualty Clearing Station, about 165 stragglers and 73 reinforcements. About half of the troops were support rather than combat troops. Blackburn organised his soldiers into three infantry battalions, based on the machine gunners, pioneers and engineers respectively, created a headquarters, and formed a supporting transport and supply unit from the 2/3rd Reserve Motor Transport Company. Blackforce was instructed to fight alongside local Dutch forces under the overall command of the Dutch &quot;Luitenant-generaal&quot; Hein ter Poorten, but was subordinate to the local Dutch divisional commander, &quot;Generaal-majoor&quot; W. Schilling, and to the General Officer Commanding British Troops in the Dutch East Indies, Major General Hervey Sitwell. Blackforce was essentially deployed to achieve the political purpose of strengthening the resolve of the Dutch, who, according to the Australian Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, were &quot;entirely immobile ... inexperienced and probably not highly trained&quot;.

Based on lessons learnt from the fighting in Malaya and Singapore that highlighted the futility of static defence, Blackburn adopted mobility, counter-flanking movements and defence-in-depth as his maxims for Blackforce. Blackforce was able to re-equip itself to a significant extent from the Tanjung Priok wharves, where it obtained hundreds of Bren machine guns and Thompson submachine guns, grenades, ammunition, and vehicles, from stocks originally intended to re-supply Singapore. Heavy weapons remained in short supply, although a few mortars and light armoured vehicles were available. Blackburn&#x27;s Dutch commanders directed him to disperse his force to protect five airfields from paratroop drops, orders which Blackburn only grudgingly obeyed, as he was concerned about splitting Blackforce. On 20 February, it divided itself between the various airfields, where its members established defensive positions. Blackburn set up his headquarters in Batavia. On 23 February, Blackburn went to Schilling and asked that he be permitted to concentrate his force for training, but this was refused. The following day, Blackburn was summoned to General Sir Archibald Wavell&#x27;s American-British-Dutch-Australian Command headquarters in Bandung where he met with Wavell. He was directed to use his force in offensive operations against the Japanese. On 25 February, Sitwell and Schilling permitted Blackforce to be concentrated for this purpose, and Sitwell attached a United States artillery unit, a British signals section, and a squadron of 16 obsolescent light tanks to Blackburn&#x27;s command.

By 27 February, Blackburn had established his headquarters in Buitenzorg, on the road between Batavia and Bandung. Blackforce was to be kept as a mobile reserve to strike the Japanese once they landed, with the Dutch conducting delaying actions. On the following night, the Japanese landed a division in the Merak area on the northwestern tip of Java, and a regiment east of Batavia at Eretanwetan. Both landings were unopposed, and the regimental one was guided in by fifth-column elements among the population. Another division and additional regiment landed further east along the Java coast. The Japanese forces that landed on Java numbered 25,000. Arrayed against them was a Dutch force of the same strength with a ratio of one Dutch to 40 locally recruited troops. Many of the local troops viewed the Japanese as liberators from Dutch colonialism rather than an enemy to be resisted.

The Japanese advance from Merak progressed swiftly, covering by noon on 1 March, with the Dutch putting up little resistance. The Japanese force quickly captured Serang then split into two, with one column pushing east along the north coast towards Batavia and the other driving southeast to Rangkasbitung and Djasinga and preparing to cross the Tjianten River at Leuwiliang to capture Buitenzorg. Initially Blackburn planned a counter-attack against the southern advance for 2 March with the Dutch to hold the Japanese at Djasinga, but this was cancelled when the Dutch withdrew to the Bandung area, east of Leuwiliang. As part of the withdrawal, the Dutch blew up the bridge over the Tjianten River at Leuwiliang early on 2 March, severely restricting Blackburn&#x27;s freedom of manoeuvre against the southern force. He was then ordered by Schilling to move most of his force approximately east to counter-attack against the regimental-sized force that had landed at Eretanwetan and was advancing south towards Bandung. This order was withdrawn after Blackburn opposed it on the grounds that the Japanese position was not known, the attack would be ill-prepared, and his efforts would be better spent preparing a rearguard defence at Leuwiliang. Sitwell supported Blackburn. Now able to consolidate a position against the southern force, Blackburn disposed two companies of his strongest fighting unit, the 2/2nd Pioneers, in depth along the road just east of Leuwiliang, and kept the remainder of Blackforce in reserve, ready to conduct counter-encirclement operations.

About 12:00 on 2 March, five Japanese light tanks arrived at the destroyed bridge and were promptly engaged by the pioneers. Two tanks were quickly disabled and the remainder withdrew. Blackburn, realising that the Japanese would begin to probe his defences and try to outflank them, ordered his reserves to fan out to the north and south of the main blocking position at Leuwiliang. The Japanese soon tried to cross the river about south of the bridge, but were met with a hail of fire and withdrew with heavy casualties. Over the next three days, the Japanese tried to outflank and encircle the Australian positions, mainly to the south, but Blackburn deployed his forces to the flanks to check them. On one occasion he withdrew one of his units slightly, drew a significant number of Japanese across the river into a killing ground and caused them serious casualties. Blackburn deployed his last reserves on the afternoon of 4 March, and was finally outflanked to the south that afternoon. He ordered his men to break contact and withdraw closer to Buitenzorg. For the loss of around 100 casualties, Blackforce had held up a divisional-sized Japanese force for three days and killed around 500 Japanese and wounded another 500. The Japanese later stated that they believed that Blackforce was of divisional strength, despite it being only a weak brigade.

Blackburn conducted a fighting withdrawal through a series of fall-back positions to a point just southeast of Buitenzorg, then disengaged and moved back to Sukabumi, about southeast of Buitenzorg. Blackburn was then given orders to deploy Blackforce into the Bandung perimeter as a mobile reserve. It soon became clear that the Dutch were about to capitulate, and the Commonwealth commanders decided to leave the Dutch and make a stand south of Bandung. Poorten surrendered Java on 8 March, but Blackburn was reluctant to do so, and sought medical advice on the idea of continuing resistance in the hills. He was advised against this course of action due to the likelihood of many soldiers becoming sick with tropical and other diseases, and surrendered his force on 11 March. During the fighting on Java, 36 Australians were killed and 60 were wounded. In his last order to his commanders Blackburn wrote:

===Captivity===

Until the end of March, Blackforce was held in towns, including in the Leles market square which had been surrounded by barbed wire. It was then split up, with troops dispersed to different camps. Blackburn was initially told that a significant number of his troops would be sent to Batavia, and that they would have to march the at a rate of a day, camping beside the road without shelter during the wet season. Many of the troops already had dysentery and/or malaria, and some were unaccustomed to marching long distances. Blackburn wrote a letter, signed by other Allied commanders, protesting this order. The letter said that men would die if the order was carried out, and that he would hold the Japanese responsible for their deaths. The Japanese rescinded the order and the troops travelled by train, leaving on 13 April. Many of the 2/3rd were sent to another camp.

====Bicycle Camp====

Blackburn arrived at the so-called &quot;Bicycle Camp&quot; in Batavia on 14 April. Sitwell and other more senior officers were sequestered in a fenced-off part of the camp, so Blackburn became the senior officer, with an American colonel, Albert Searle, as his deputy. The camp contained about 2,600 POWs: 2,000 Australians, 200 British, 200 Americans, 100 Indians and 100 Dutch, all packed into a former Dutch barracks designed for 1,000. During his first month at the camp, Blackburn began a diary using an old ledger, which he maintained for much of his internment against the explicit orders of the Japanese. At one point he removed the covers from the ledger and hid the pages inside the lining of his raincoat. The food rations at the Bicycle Camp were poor, and because Japan was not a party to the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War and did not follow its stipulations, it was difficult to maintain discipline as all but Blackburn had to work regardless of rank.

Blackburn arranged activities to alleviate the boredom and consistently stood up to the Japanese. He was interrogated and was struck by a guard on at least one occasion, but was spared any torture. More junior officers were subjected to torture, beatings and other abuse. The Japanese tried to persuade Blackburn and others to participate in propaganda radio broadcasts, but Blackburn gave orders against it and refused to do so himself. In June, the Japanese ordered all prisoners to sign a form stating that they would comply with all orders and would not resist their captors. Blackburn only signed after appending &quot;except where contrary to my oath of allegiance to His Majesty the King&quot;. When another form was produced, requiring an oath to be sworn, Blackburn refused. Privileges were withdrawn, dozens of officers and men were beaten, and Blackburn was placed in solitary confinement. In the end, when the Americans decided to sign, Blackburn agreed in the interests of unity and ordered all the troops to sign. By the end of July, Blackburn was conscious that he had lost about in weight due to the poor rations.

Blackburn was promoted to substantive colonel on 1 September 1942, but retained his temporary rank of brigadier whilst in captivity. In the same month, he began to suffer from depression and fell ill with dengue fever. The Japanese commandant was replaced with a stricter man, and the guards were replaced with Koreans, who quickly earned a reputation for cruelty. Beatings were conducted for minor infractions, such as failing to stand to attention quickly enough. In early October, 1,500 POWs left the camp, including almost all of the 2/2nd Pioneers, destined for the Thailand–Burma railway. Another group of 84 left a few days later, but the losses were soon made up by the arrival of several thousand Dutch and 113 Royal Air Force personnel from a camp in Bandung. By this stage, every couple of days a POW was dying in the camp, mainly due to dysentery. By Christmas, conditions had improved somewhat and Blackburn was able to gather enough funds to purchase food for a Christmas dinner. On 28 December he was driven out of the Bicycle Camp to continue his internment elsewhere. The unit historian of the 2/2nd Pioneers later wrote of Blackburn&#x27;s time at the Bicycle Camp, &quot;His quiet dignity, masking an unquenchable spirit of protest against Japanese injustices, earned him the admiration of the officers and men who shared with him the humiliation of captivity&quot;.

====Changi, Japan and Formosa====

Blackburn and some other senior officers were transferred from Java to Singapore by ship, arriving on 1 January 1943, and Blackburn was briefly held at the Changi POW Camp. His time there was much more relaxed than on Java, and he enjoyed freedom of movement and the ability to catch up with friends, including his World War I platoon sergeant. There were no beatings, and few Japanese were seen, as the guards were mainly Sikh defectors from the British Indian Army. On 7 January a party of 900 POWs arrived from Java, including a large number of 2/3rd men, led by the surgeon Lieutenant Colonel Ernest &quot;Weary&quot; Dunlop. This group soon ended up on the Thailand-Burma railway with the 2/2nd Pioneers. Blackburn&#x27;s stay ended on 10 January, but not before Dunlop had given him a list of men who he recommended should be promoted or receive awards after the war.

Along with other senior officers, including Sitwell, ter Poorten and Searle, Blackburn was sent to Japan by sea, arriving in Moji on 19 January. After a short stay in a camp that held American and Indian POWs, the party of senior officers left Japan by ship on 25 January, and four days later disembarked in southwestern Formosa (now Taiwan). On arrival at Karenko Camp, the party were paraded before the commandant and ordered to make an oath that they would not try to escape. Blackburn said that he would only sign under protest and duress, and asked what the penalty was for not signing. He was beaten and placed in solitary confinement, and the Japanese subjected him to sleep deprivation. Two days later he signed the oath and was released into the main camp. The Karenko Camp held 400 men, including the most senior Allied officers the Japanese had captured, many of them generals. Food was scarce, everyone was required to work, and seven weeks after arriving, Blackburn&#x27;s weight was down to (101 pounds), (28 pounds) lighter than he had been when he had enlisted in 1914.

Blackburn was beaten several times while held at Karenko Camp, as were other senior officers, often for the most minor of supposed infractions. Blackburn&#x27;s closest friends were Sitwell and Searle. On 2 April, all prisoners above the rank of colonel were sent to a new camp at Tamasata, about south of Karenko. Searle was left behind, and Sitwell was allocated to a different barracks from Blackburn. He found some of his fellow POWs difficult to get on with, particularly the Australian Brigadiers Harold Burfield Taylor and Duncan Maxwell. With the arrival of Red Cross food parcels in April, Blackburn put on almost (11 pounds). The reduced work routine compared to Karenko contributed to this. Boredom and depression dogged Blackburn during this period, and the lack of letters from home exacerbated both. Also in April, Blackburn&#x27;s family finally received confirmation he was alive, having heard nothing since his capture. In early June, he and 89 other POWs were returned to Karenko, but this stay was brief, as they were soon transported to another camp in Shirakawa in central Formosa, arriving there on 8 June. The food was again poor, malaria was rife, and the POWs were again required to work. By late August, Blackburn had lost a total of (61 pounds) since his capture in March 1942.

Blackburn&#x27;s eyesight, which had been deteriorating for some time, became so bad that he could not read for more than half an hour. This contributed to his depression, which again took hold, accompanied by recurring nightmares. By early 1944, Blackburn had been in captivity for nearly two years, but had not received a single letter from his family. They had been writing regularly, but the letters failed to get through. His health was poor, with multiple ailments and severe headaches. It was not until 29 March that he received a letter, dated 30 September 1942. In mid-1944, he received ten letters at once, and discovered that his son Robert had been married. In late September, Blackburn and the other senior officers were transported to Heito in southern Formosa and flown to Japan, Pusan in Korea, and from there by train to Manchuria.

====Manchuria and liberation====

The new camp was Chen Cha Tung POW Camp, located about northwest of Mukden on the edge of the Gobi Desert. The party all signed the usual form promising not to escape, having long ago decided they were worthless and resistance was futile. Despite the cold and bleak surroundings, the conditions were in some respects better than in previous camps. Blackburn stopped keeping a diary soon after arrival, as he had run out of ledger paper and was in deep depression. Due to the cold, there were few activities, and most of the prisoners refused to volunteer to work growing vegetables as they did not trust the Japanese to give them a fair share of the produce. In May 1945, the party was transferred to the Hoten POW Camp on the outskirts of Mukden. Blackburn considered this camp the best of all those he had been held in during the war, with showers and hot baths, although the latrines were always overflowing and the food was poor. Blackburn had received no letters since arriving in Manchuria, and this contributed to his depression. On 15 August, the POWs were told that the war was over, and a few days later, a Soviet Red Army tank drove through the camp fence and they were liberated. Searching the offices afterwards, the POWs found thousands of letters and three months&#x27; worth of Red Cross food packages. Within days of liberation, Blackburn was on an aircraft, returning to Australia.

===Return to Australia===

Blackburn&#x27;s return to Australia was circuitous. He first flew to Sian then Kunming in China, where he spent 36 hours in hospital. The next flight was across the Himalayas to Calcutta in British India where he was hospitalised for another 36 hours. The next destination was Colombo, after which he flew to Perth, Australia, arriving on 13 September. On the same day he was flown to Melbourne with a short stop in Adelaide, as he was required to report to Army Headquarters and deliver official documents he had kept during his internment. His family travelled by train to Melbourne to meet him. They met at the railway station, and were shocked at his appearance. At this point, Blackburn only weighed (88 pounds). After a week in Melbourne, the family returned to Adelaide, and Blackburn was hospitalised for two weeks.

On arrival in Adelaide, he was greeted by three other VC recipients, Phillip Davey, Roy Inwood and Thomas Caldwell. On the Sunday after his return, 62 former members of the 2/3rd who had not been offloaded in Java marched up his street and stood to attention. They too were shocked at his appearance. On 9 May 1946, he was awarded the Efficiency Decoration. On 28 May, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) (CBE) for his gallant and distinguished service in Java. His citation for the CBE noted that:

This was followed by an additional period in hospital in June and July. Blackburn&#x27;s Second AIF appointment was terminated on 18 July, at which time he relinquished his temporary rank of brigadier and was transferred to the Reserve of Officers List. He was also granted the honorary rank of brigadier. In addition to the CBE, Blackburn was also awarded the 1939–1945 Star, Pacific Star, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945 for his service during World War II. Both of Blackburn&#x27;s sons, Richard and Robert, served in the Second AIF during World War II.

==Later life==

On 11 October 1946, Blackburn was again appointed to active duty from the Reserve of Officers List, and was again temporarily promoted to brigadier while he was attached to 2nd Australian War Crimes Section as a witness before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, Japan. Despite his willing involvement, he believed that the trials targeted mainly those who physically participated in crimes, rather than those that ordered them. In December, he was again elected as state president of the renamed Returned Sailors&#x27; Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Imperial League of Australia (RSSAILA), supported by McCann, who was elected as a vice-president. He continued to advocate on behalf of veterans, and took a special interest in the surviving men of the 2/3rd. On 11 January 1947, Blackburn was transferred back to the Reserve of Officers List, retaining the honorary rank of brigadier.

Blackburn was unable to return to private legal practice due to his health, relinquished his role as city coroner in 1947, and was appointed as one of the fifteen inaugural conciliation commissioners of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, a position he held until 1955. Given his political history and involvement with the suppression of dockside workers by the &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Defence Brigade&quot; in 1928, the South Australian convention of the Australian Labor Party expressed &quot;grave alarm&quot; at his appointment. He was also chairman of trustees for the Services Canteen Trust Fund from 1947 until his death. Blackburn was re-elected as president of RSSAILA in 1948. On 8 June 1949, Blackburn was appointed as the honorary colonel of the Adelaide University Regiment (AUR), and he was transferred to the Retired List in January 1950 with the honorary rank of brigadier. In September of the same year he relinquished his role as state president of RSSAILA. In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. He relinquished his honorary colonel role with AUR in January 1955. In 1955, he was appointed as a member of the Australian National Airlines Commission and a director of Trans Australia Airlines. He also served on the Television Broadcaster&#x27;s Board, overseeing the introduction of that medium into South Australia, and was a trustee of the Civilian Internees Trust Fund and Prisoners of War Trust Fund. For his &quot;exceptionally fine honorary service as chairman of several trusts, especially for the benefit of ex-servicemen and their dependants&quot;, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1955 New Year Honours. The following year, Blackburn and his wife attended the VC centenary gathering in London, and visited the Pozières battlefield in France.

Blackburn died on 24 November 1960 at Crafers, South Australia, aged 67, from a ruptured aneurism of the common iliac artery, and was buried with full military honours in the AIF section of Adelaide&#x27;s West Terrace Cemetery. Many members of the public and hundreds of former members of the 10th Battalion and 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion lined the route between St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral and the cemetery, and eight brigadiers were pallbearers. His medal set, including his VC, was passed to his son Richard, then to his grandson Tom, before being donated to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, where it is displayed in the Hall of Valour.

The Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs office in Adelaide was named &quot;Blackburn House&quot; in 1991. there were eleven streets in Adelaide named for Blackburn, and one in Brisbane. In 2008, it was debated whether to call the new tunnel under Anzac Highway either the Blackburn Underpass or Inwood Underpass, after another South Australian who was also conferred a VC in 1917, Roy Inwood. The Returned &amp; Services League of Australia objected that naming the tunnel after a specific veteran was inappropriate, saying it should be named after a major World War I battleground, in line with the highway&#x27;s theme. On completion, the tunnel was named the Gallipoli Underpass.

<text>Issenheim (; ) is a commune in the Haut-Rhin department in Grand Est in north-eastern France.

The Isenheim Altarpiece, currently on display at the Unterlinden Museum of Colmar, was completed in 1515 by Matthias Grünewald for the Antonines monastery in Issenheim.

Among his many other titles, Prince Albert II of Monaco is ceremonially styled as &quot;&quot;Seigneur&quot; of Issenheim&quot;.

<doc id="1182808" wikidata="Q609621" url="?curid=1182808" title="MAPP gas">
<text>MAPP gas was a trademarked name, belonging to The Linde Group, a division of the former global chemical giant Union Carbide, for a fuel gas based on a stabilized mixture of methylacetylene (propyne), propadiene and propane. The name comes from the original chemical composition, methylacetylene-propadiene propane. &quot;MAPP gas&quot; is also widely used as a generic name for UN 1060 stabilised methylacetylene-propadiene (unstabilised methylacetylene-propadiene is known as MAPD).

MAPP gas was widely regarded as a safer and easier-to-use substitute for acetylene, but, early in 2008, its production was discontinued at the only remaining plant in North America that still manufactured it. However, there are many MAPP substitutes on the market, often labeled &quot;MAPP&quot;, &quot;MAP-X&quot; or &quot;MAP-Plus&quot; but containing mostly propylene with some propane and in some cases also dimethyl ether.
==Use==
Genuine MAPP gas can be used in combination with oxygen for heating, soldering, brazing and even welding because of its high flame temperature of 2925 °C (5300 °F) in oxygen. Although acetylene has a higher flame temperature (3160 °C, 5720 °F), MAPP has the advantage that it requires neither dilution nor special container fillers during transport, allowing a greater volume of fuel gas to be transported at the same given weight, and it is much safer in use.

A MAPP/oxygen flame is not entirely appropriate for welding steel, due to the high concentration of hydrogen in the flame – higher than acetylene, but lower than any of the other petroleum fuel gases. The hydrogen infuses into the molten steel and renders the welds brittle. For small-scale welding with MAPP this is not a serious problem, as the hydrogen escapes readily, and MAPP/oxygen can in practice be used for welding small steel parts.

MAPP/oxygen was advantageously used in underwater cutting, which requires high gas pressures (under such pressures acetylene can decompose explosively, making it dangerous to use). However, underwater oxy/fuel gas cutting of any kind has been largely replaced by exothermic cutting because it cuts more quickly and safely.

MAPP gas is also used in combustion with air for brazing and soldering, where it has a slight advantage over competing propane fuel because of its higher combustion temperature of 2,020 °C (3,670 °F) in air.

The biggest disadvantage of MAPP gas is cost; it is typically one-and-a-half times as expensive as propane at the refinery, and up to four times as expensive to the consumer. It is no longer used much in any large-scale industry – for larger scale users acetylene/oxygen is more economic than MAPP/oxygen when high flame temperatures are needed, and propane/air is more economic when big overall heating is needed.

However, for the small-scale user a MAPP/oxygen flame is still highly desirable, having higher flame temperatures and energy densities than any flame other than acetylene/oxygen, but without the dangers and inconveniences of acetylene/oxygen. Jewellers, glassbead makers, and many others find it very useful. Plumbers, refrigeration and HVAC engineers and other tradesmen also value the high heat capacity of the MAPP/air flame; MAPP was until recently widely used, supplied in small to medium size containers.

Blowtorches are used to brown and sear food cooked by low-temperature sous-vide techniques. Myhrvold recommends in &quot;Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking&quot; that MAPP gases should be used in preference to cheaper butane or propane as they produce higher temperatures with less risk of giving the food a gas flavour, as can happen with incompletely combusted gas.

==Physical properties==
MAPP is colorless in both liquid and gas form. The gas has a pronounced acetylene-like or fishy odor at concentrations above 100 ppm, due to the addition of substituted amines as a polymerization inhibitor. Low molecular weight alkynes have strong odors. MAPP gas is toxic if inhaled at high concentrations.

The composition of the supplied gas has varied widely, with the gases as supplied by different repackagers/resellers at any one time varying, as well as the general composition varying over time, but a typical composition for an early Dow gas might be: methylacetylene (propyne) 48%, propadiene 23%, propane 27%. For a later Dow/Petromont gas propyne 30%, propadiene 14%, propylene 43%, propane 7%, C4H10 (isobutane, butane) 6% might be more typical.

==Thermal properties==
MAPP has an energy content of 21000 BTU/lb (13.57 kWh/kg) while acetylene&#x27;s energy content is 25000 BTU/lb (16.15 kWh/kg).

== Safety ==
People can be exposed to MAPP gas or its substitutes in the workplace by inhaling the gas or skin/eye contact with the liquid. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit for MAPP gas exposure in the workplace as 1000 ppm (1800 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1000 ppm (1800 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday and 1250 ppm (2250 mg/m3) for short-term exposure. At levels of 3400 ppm, 10% of the lower explosive limit, MAPP gas is immediately dangerous to life and health.

<text>Major William Anderson Bloomfield VC (30 January 1873 – 12 May 1954) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. His parents emigrated to South Africa in 1878.

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Freemasonry in Concordia Lodge, No. 2685, (E.C.) (Ermelo, Mpumalanga Province, Republic of South Africa) on 18 June, Passed on 16 July and Raised on 16 July 1904.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 43 years old, and a captain in the Scout Corps, 2nd South African Mounted Brigade, South African Forces during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 August 1916 at Mlali, Tanganyika (now Tanzania), when consolidating his new position after being heavily attacked and being forced to retire, Captain Bloomfield found that one of the wounded – a corporal – had not been evacuated with the rest. At considerable personal risk the captain went back over 400 yards of ground swept by machine-gun and rifle fire and managed to reach the wounded man and bring him back to safety.

Whilst he was Scottish-born, he is also considered a South African as he emigrated there. Bloomfield later achieved the rank of major. He is buried in the cemetery in Ermelo, Mpumalanga, South Africa.

His Victoria Cross was displayed at the National Museum of Military History in Johannesburg and is now kept by his family.

==Recognition==

A pavement plaque to Bloomfield was added on the side of the Union Canal near the new Boroughmuir High School in 2020.

<doc id="1182816" wikidata="Q233249" url="?curid=1182816" title="World No Tobacco Day">
<text>World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) is observed around the world every year on 31 May. The annual observance informs the public on the dangers of using tobacco, the business practices of tobacco companies, what the World Health Organization (WHO) is doing to fight against the use of tobacco, and what people around the world can do to claim their right to health and healthy living and to protect future generations.

The Member States of the WHO created World No Tobacco Day in 1987 to draw global attention to the tobacco epidemic and the preventable death and disease it causes. The day is further intended to draw attention to the widespread prevalence of tobacco use and to negative health effects, which currently lead to more than 8 million deaths each year worldwide, including 1.2 million as the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. The day has been met with both enthusiasm and resistance around the globe from governments, public health organizations, smokers, growers, and the tobacco industry.

==WHO and World No Tobacco Day==

WNTD is one of 11 official global public health campaigns marked by the WHO, along with World Health Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Immunization Week, World Tuberculosis Day, World Malaria Day, World Hepatitis Day, World Chagas Disease Day, World Patient Safety Day, World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, and World AIDS Day.

===Timeline===
* In 1987, the WHO&#x27;s World Health Assembly passed Resolution WHA40.38, calling for 7 April 1988 to be &quot;a world no-smoking day&quot;. The objective of the day was to urge tobacco users worldwide to abstain from using tobacco products for 24 hours, an action they hoped would provide assistance for those trying to quit.
* In 1988, Resolution WHA42.19 was passed by the World Health Assembly, calling for the celebration of World No Tobacco Day, every year on 31 May. Since then, the WHO has supported World No Tobacco Day every year, linking each year to a different tobacco-related theme.
* In 1998, the WHO established the Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI), an attempt to focus international resources and attention on the global health issue of tobacco. The initiative provides assistance for creating global public health policy, encourages mobilization between societies, and supports the &quot;World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control&quot; (FCTC). The WHO FCTC is a global public health treaty adopted in 2003 by countries around the globe as an agreement to implement policies that work towards tobacco cessation.
* In 2008, on the eve of the World No Tobacco Day, the WHO called for a worldwide ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship. The theme of that year&#x27;s day was &quot;Tobacco-free youth&quot;; therefore, this initiative was especially meant to target advertising efforts aimed at youth. According to the WHO, the tobacco industry must replace older quitting or dying smokers with younger consumers. Because of this, marketing strategies are commonly observed in places that will attract youth such as movies, the Internet, billboards, and magazines. Studies have shown that the more youth are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to smoke.
* In 2015, WNTD highlighted the health risks associated with tobacco use and advocated for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption, including ending the illicit trade of tobacco products.
* In 2016, on World No Tobacco Day, the WHO called on governments to get ready for plain packaging of tobacco products.
* In 2017, the focus was &quot;A threat to development&quot;. The campaign aims to demonstrate the threats that the tobacco industry poses to sustainable development, including the health and economic well-being of citizens in all countries.
* In 2018, the focus was &quot;Tobacco breaks hearts: choose health, not tobacco&quot; #NoTobacco.
* In 2019, the focus was on &quot;Tobacco and lung health&quot;.
* In 2020, the focus was on &quot;Tobacco and related industry tactics to attract younger generations&quot;.
* In 2021, the focus was &quot;Commit to quit&quot;.
* In 2022, the focus was &quot;Tobacco: Threat to our environment&quot;.
* In 2023, the focus was &quot;Grow food, not tobacco&quot;.
* In 2024, the focus was &quot;Protecting children from tobacco industry interference&quot;.
* In 2025, the focus will be &quot;Unmasking the appeal: exposing industry tactics on tobacco and nicotine products&quot;.

===Themes===
Each year, the WHO selects a theme for the day in order to create a more unified global message for WNTD. This theme then becomes the central component of the WHO&#x27;s tobacco-related agenda for the following year. The WHO oversees the creation and distribution of publicity materials related to the theme, including brochures, fliers, posters, websites, and press releases. Videos were created as a part of the 2008 WNTD awareness campaign for the theme &quot;Tobacco-free youth&quot; and published on YouTube, and podcasts were first used in 2009.

In many of its WNTD themes and related publicity-materials, the WHO emphasizes the idea of &quot;truth&quot;. Theme titles such as &quot;Tobacco kills, don&#x27;t be duped&quot; (2000) and &quot;Tobacco: deadly in any form or disguise&quot; (2006) indicate a WHO belief that individuals may be misled or confused about the true nature of tobacco; the rationale for the 2000 and 2008 WNTD themes identify the marketing strategies and &quot;illusions&quot; created by the tobacco industry as a primary source of this confusion. The WHO&#x27;s WNTD materials present an alternate understanding of the &quot;facts&quot; as seen from a global public health perspective. WNTD publicity materials provide an &quot;official&quot; interpretation of the most up-to-date tobacco-related research and statistics and provide a common ground from which to formulate anti-tobacco arguments around the world.
Themes for World No Tobacco Day have been &quot;Tobacco – a threat to development&quot; (2017), &quot;Tobacco breaks hearts&quot; (2018), &quot;Make Every Day World No Tobacco Day&quot; (2019), &quot;Tobacco Exposed: The secret&#x27;s out&quot; (2020), and &quot;Commit to Quit&quot; (2021). &quot;Tobacco: Threat to our environment&quot; (2022),&quot;We need food, not tobacco&quot; (2023).

===Event coordination===
The WHO serves as a central hub for fostering communication and coordinating WNTD events around the world. The WHO website provides a place for groups to share news of their activities, and the organization publishes this information online by country.

===Awards===
Since 1988, the WHO has presented one or more awards to organizations or individuals who have made exceptional contributions to reducing tobacco consumption. World No Tobacco Day Awards are given to individuals from six different world regions (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific), and Director-General Special Awards and Recognition Certificates are given to individuals from any region.

==Global observance==
Groups around the world – from local clubs to city councils to national governments – are encouraged by the WHO to organize events each year to help communities celebrate World No Tobacco Day in their own way at the local level. Past events have included letter writing campaigns to government officials and local newspapers, marches, public debates, local and national publicity campaigns, anti-tobacco activist meetings, educational programming, and public art.

In addition, many governments use WNTD as the start date for implementing new smoking bans and tobacco control efforts. For example, on 31 May 2008, a section of the &quot;Smoke Free Ontario Act&quot; came into effect banning tobacco &quot;power walls&quot; and displays at stores in this Canadian province, and all hospitals and government offices in Australia became smoke-free on 31 May 2010.

The day has also been used as a springboard for discussing the current and future state of a country as it relates to tobacco—for example in India which, with 275 million tobacco users, has one of the highest levels of tobacco consumption in the world. The Government of India has also launched a Smoking Cessation Helpline to help curb the widespread addiction in the country.

==Resistance==
For some, WNTD is seen as a challenge to individual freedom of choice or even a culturally acceptable form of discrimination. From ignoring WNTD, to participating in protests or acts of defiance, to bookending the day with extra rounds of pro-tobacco advertisements and events, smokers, tobacco growers, and the tobacco industry have found ways to make their opinions heard.

===Smoker response===
There has been no sustained or widespread effort to organize counter-WNTD events on the part of smokers. However, some small groups, particularly in the United States, have created local pro-smoking events. For example, the &quot;Oregon Commentator&quot;, an independent conservative journal of opinion published at the University of Oregon, hosted a &quot;Great American Smoke-in&quot; on campus as a counter to the locally more widespread Great American Smokeout: &quot;In response to the ever-increasing vilification of smokers on campus, the Oregon Commentator presents the Great American Smoke-in as an opportunity for students to join together and enjoy the pleasures of fine tobacco products&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Americans for Freedom of Choice&quot;, a group in Honolulu, Hawaii, organized &quot;World Defiance Day&quot; in response to WNTD and Hawaii&#x27;s statewide ban on smoking in restaurants.

===Industry response===
Historically, in America the tobacco industry has funded state initiatives that provide resources to help smokers quit smoking as per the Master Settlement Agreement regulated by the U.S. government. For example, Philip Morris USA operates a website that acts as a guide for those who choose to quit smoking.

World No Tobacco Days have not induced a positive vocal response from the tobacco industry. For example, a memo made publicly available through the Tobacco Archives website was sent out to executives of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in preparation for the third annual World No Tobacco Day, which had the theme of &quot;Childhood and Youth Without Tobacco&quot;. The memo includes a warning about the upcoming day, a document that explains the arguments they anticipate the WHO making, and an explanation of how the company should respond to these claims. For example, in response to the anticipated argument that their advertisements target children, the company&#x27;s response includes arguments that claim their advertisements are targeted towards adults by using adult models, and that advertisements lack the power to influence what people will actually purchase. In Uganda, since the World No Tobacco Day is the one day that the media is obligated to publicize tobacco control issues, the British American Tobacco company uses the eve of the day to administer counter-publicity. In 2001, their strategy included events such as a visit with the President of the International Tobacco Growers Association.

Some major pharmaceutical companies publicly support WNTD. For example, Pfizer was a large sponsor for many WNTD events in the United Arab Emirates in 2008. At the time, Pfizer was preparing to release its drug Chantix (varenicline) into the Middle Eastern market. The drug was &quot;designed to activate the nicotinic receptor to reduce both the severity of the smoker&#x27;s craving and the withdrawal symptoms from nicotine&quot;.

===Grower response===
Many tobacco growers feel that anti-tobacco efforts by organizations such as the WHO jeopardize their rights. For example, the International Tobacco Growers Association (ITGA) argues that poor farmers in Africa may suffer the consequences if WHO anti-tobacco movements succeed. They also argue that these efforts may gang up on manufacturers of tobacco and be an attack on the industry, therefore hurting the growers.

===Potential for Indigenous American opposition===
As some traditions and ceremonies of a number of cultures and ethnicities of Native Americans in the United States and First Nations in North America have been based on tobacco since pre-Columbian times, some potential for unintended abrogation of such traditions may exist from authorities seeking to eliminate tobacco from worldwide use – traditions of &quot;non&quot;-combustive use of tobacco for some forms of indigenous American ceremonial purposes have begun to be used for cessation of cigarette use among indigenous tribal members, while members of the Oglala Lakota have had their struggles to retain important historic tribal artifacts used for tobacco&#x27;s traditional role in their ethnicity&#x27;s traditions, to prevent their illegal sale. It is possible that a 2015 survey from Health Canada concerning future tobacco control legislation in Canada, having a section requesting advice from indigenous peoples within Canada, showed the potential of concern over such issues.

<doc id="1182820" wikidata="Q430706" url="?curid=1182820" title="Phil Thompson">
<text>Philip Bernard Thompson (born 21 January 1954) is an English retired footballer, who played as a defender for Liverpool team of the 1970s and 1980s. During this time, he also represented the England national football team on 42 occasions, and captained England on six occasions. After retiring as a player, he later served Liverpool as assistant manager and, during the 2001–02 season, acted as caretaker for six months while manager Gérard Houllier was ill. He was a pundit on Soccer Saturday on Sky Sports for 22 years until August 2020, does occasional work as a pundit for TV 2 (Norway), and is a regular Visiting Fellow at the University of Liverpool where he teaches on the Football Industries MBA.

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
Thompson was born in Kirkby, Lancashire, and was a Liverpool supporter, who stood on The Kop as a boy. His dreams came true when he signed as a professional for the club on 22 January 1971, the day after his 17th birthday.

He made his first team debut the following year against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. With the Reds 2–0 up in the 81st minute Shankly took off John Toshack, replacing him with the 18-year-old defender. The move was intended to tighten up the defence and keep a clean-sheet, but three minutes later, Emlyn Hughes popped up with a goal for Liverpool, with the game ending this way. In 1973, Liverpool won a double haul of trophies—the League championship and UEFA Cup and Thompson played a role in both successes earning league and UEFA Cup medals in the process. The next season led to him displacing Larry Lloyd from the side altogether and pushed Tommy Smith across to full back, and he settled into a defensive partnership with club captain Hughes.

Thompson man-marked Malcolm Macdonald out of the game as Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3–0 in the 1974 FA Cup Final, this after Macdonald had boasted what he was going to do to the Reds in the game. He remained a major part of the team which, again, won the League and UEFA Cup double in 1976.

1976 was also the year in which he was called up to play for England for the first time, his debut coming on 24 March in a 2–1 win over Wales in a friendly at the Racecourse Ground at Wrexham. During a summer mini-tournament held in the United States on 28 May 1976, Thompson scored his one and only goal for England in a friendly match against Italy in New York.

Liverpool&#x27;s most productive season followed in 1977, but Thompson was to unluckily miss out. Although he played enough games to guarantee a medal when Liverpool retained the title, he suffered an injury which denied him a role in the exciting charge towards a unique treble, as Liverpool limped into the finals of both the FA Cup and European Cup. The veteran Smith took Thompson&#x27;s place; while Liverpool lost the 1977 FA Cup Final to Manchester United, they won their first European Cup a few days later in Rome by beating Borussia Mönchengladbach (with Smith scoring Liverpool&#x27;s second goal).

Thompson recovered from his injury and returned to the defence the following season, scoring a goal in Liverpool&#x27;s victory over Kevin Keegan&#x27;s Hamburg in the 1977 UEFA Super Cup final. Liverpool reached their first League Cup final at Wembley (a competition which they had previously not taken seriously) and after a goalless draw against Nottingham Forest, the game went to a replay. It was a disappointing evening for Thompson, who committed the foul on Forest midfielder John O&#x27;Hare that led to the penalty that won the game for Brian Clough&#x27;s men. Thompson no doubt counts himself a little unlucky – although he did commit the foul, replays appeared to show that it took place outside the penalty area. Liverpool also surrendered the League title to Forest, but managed to retain the European Cup with a win over FC Bruges, a game in which Thompson this time played.

Thompson was accompanied by a new central defensive partner in Alan Hansen as Liverpool regained the title in 1979. When Hughes left the club for Wolves late in 1979, Thompson was appointed as captain and managed to lift the League trophy in 1980. He continued to play frequently for England and was in the squad which qualified for a major tournament&#x27;s finals for the first time in a decade, though England&#x27;s performances at the 1980 European Championships in Italy were disappointing.

Thompson&#x27;s proudest moment as Liverpool skipper came in 1981 when he lifted the European Cup after a 1–0 victory over Real Madrid in the Paris final—the club&#x27;s third success in the competition. Thompson also stepped up to receive the League Cup after a replay win against West Ham United, the club&#x27;s first of four consecutive successes in the competition.

Bob Paisley upset Thompson the following season when he decided to hand the captaincy to Graeme Souness. At the time the season hadn&#x27;t started well and Thompson&#x27;s own form had dipped. Despite this however Thompson continued to play regularly in defence, winning further title medals in 1982 and 1983. He was in the team which retained the League Cup in 1982, but missed the victory in the 1983 final due to injury.

From 1984, Thompson&#x27;s opportunities as a Liverpool player were diminishing, with Hansen now being paired with the younger Mark Lawrenson. Liverpool won the title, League Cup and European Cup in this year, but Thompson did not qualify for a medal in any of these successes.

===Sheffield United===
In 1985, he was offered the manager&#x27;s job at Swindon Town but turned it down as he wanted to concentrate on playing. He was sold to Sheffield United but could not settle, so he quit playing at the comparatively early age of 31 and was recruited by new Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish as a coach.

==International career==
Thompson played 42 matches for England between 1976 and 1982.

==Off-the-field return to Liverpool==
He was with the club in this role for four years, progressing to being Dalglish&#x27;s right-hand man as the team (still containing, and now captained by, Hansen) won the League in 1988 and 1990 and the FA Cup in 1989. Thompson was working at the club at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, on 15 April 1989 at the beginning of the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. The tragedy claimed 94 lives on the day, with the final death toll reaching 97. An abiding image of Thompson the coach came in the 1989 FA Cup Final against Merseyside rivals Everton when a last minute chance for Everton to equalise went awry, and the camera caught Thompson, sweating in his suit and tie, sitting on the Wembley bench while shaking his fists in relief, delight and anticipation. Everton did equalise moments later and forced extra-time, which Liverpool eventually won.

When Souness, the man who replaced Thompson as captain, came back to the club as Dalglish&#x27;s replacement in early 1991, Thompson was kept on. Thompson was sacked by Souness in 1992 for allegedly talking to Manchester United&#x27;s Alex Ferguson and his assistant about issues at the club involving Souness. Word had got back to Souness via his connections at Rangers. It was agreed by both the club and Thompson that details of what happened would not be disclosed.

It was alleged that Souness believed Thompson was interested in his job as manager while Souness recovered from bypass surgery in the spring of 1992.

In late 1993, Thompson was widely linked with the manager vacancy at Nagoya Grampus Eight where he would get the opportunity to work with former England player Gary Lineker who was then playing for that club.

He earned a living through speaking and punditry until Gérard Houllier became Liverpool manager in 1998 and, needing a bona fide Liverpool man by his side following the departure of Roy Evans, asked Thompson to return to his old role, which Thompson accepted.
This second stint was eventful – a spat between Thompson and striker Robbie Fowler led to restricted appearances for the popular centre forward and his eventual departure to Leeds United; and Thompson spent several months in sole charge of the team (with some success) when Houllier underwent emergency heart surgery in October 2001.

During his time as assistant manager of Liverpool the Reds returned to winning ways as they completed a unique &#x27;treble&#x27; of UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup in 2001.

When Houllier was relieved of his duties in 2004, Thompson also left the club.

In September 2010, Gérard Houllier was appointed manager of Aston Villa and this led to Houllier offering him the role of assistant manager at the Midlands club. However, Thompson rejected the offer as he felt he could not commit himself to the role due to the long journey to work, the inevitably large number of scouting missions and his unwillingness to uproot his family or live away from them. Houllier then gave the job to Gary McAllister who played under him and Thompson at Liverpool.

<text>Andrew Cathcart Bogle VC (20 January 1829 – 11 December 1890) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Glasgow-born Bogle was educated at Cheltenham College. In December 1849 he joined the 78th Highlanders as an Ensign, and was promoted to Lieutenant in March 1853. He served with the 78th during the Persian War in 1857, before returning with his regiment to India at the beginning of the Indian Mutiny. Here, the 78th joined General Havelock’s column that advanced to relieve the siege of Lucknow. It was during this advance that Bogle earned the VC. 

===VC action===
Bogle was a 28 years old lieutenant in the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (later The Seaforth Highlanders, British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 29 July 1857 in the attack on Oonao, India, for which he was awarded the VC:
Bogle was presented with his VC by Queen Victoria on 4 January 1860 at Windsor Castle.

===Later career===
In February 1858 Bogle was appointed adjutant of the 78th Highlanders, and continued to serve with the regiment in the later stages of the Mutiny, including the final capture of Lucknow and the action at Bareilly. In August 1858 he was promoted captain and transferred to the 13th Foot, moving to the 10th Foot in August 1859. In April 1865 he was promoted major and transferred to the 23rd Foot in August 1868, before retiring shortly afterwards.

In retirement Bogle lived in Sherborne House, Dorset, where he died after a long illness on 11 December 1890 aged 61. He was cremated at Woking Crematorium, Surrey, and his ashes interred in St Lawrence&#x27;s Churchyard, Effingham, Surrey. 

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Highlanders Museum at Fort George, Inverness-shire in Scotland.

<doc id="1182836" wikidata="Q269248" url="?curid=1182836" title="Turanism">
<text>Turanism, also known as pan-Turanism or pan-Turanianism, is a pan-nationalist political movement built around pseudoscientific claims of biological and linguistic connections between various ethnic groups of Eurasia. It revolves around the abandoned proposal of a Ural-Altaic language family, which hypothesizes that the Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Uralic peoples share Inner and Central Asian origins and therefore close cultural, ethnic, and linguistic bonds. Supporters of Turanism propose political unity among these groups, chiefly to oppose the cultural and political influences of the Indo-Europeans of Europe and South Asia, as well as the Sino-Tibetans of East Asia. The movement emerged in the 19th century to counter pan-nationalist ideologies such as pan-Germanism, and built upon the ideas of pan-Slavism (e.g. the idea of a &quot;Turanian brotherhood and collaboration&quot; was borrowed from the pan-Slavic concept of &quot;Slavic brotherhood and collaboration&quot;).

== Origins and definitions ==
The concept of a Ural-Altaic ethnic and language family goes back to the linguistic theories of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz; in his opinion there was no better method for specifying the relationship and origin of the various peoples of the Earth, than the comparison of their languages. In his &quot;Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium ductis potissimum ex indicio linguarum&quot;, written in 1710, he originates every human language from one common ancestor language. Over time, this ancestor language split into two families: the Japhetic and the Aramaic. The Japhetic family split even further, into Scythian and Celtic branches. The members of the Scythian family were: the Greek language, the family of Sarmato-Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech, Dalmatian, Bulgar, Slovene, Avar), the family of Turkic languages (Turkish, Cuman, Kalmyk and Mongolian), the family of Finnic languages (Finnish, Saami, Hungarian, Estonian, Liv and Samoyed). Although his theory and grouping were far from perfect, it had a tremendous effect on the development of linguistic research, especially in German speaking countries.

The term &quot;Turan&quot; is of Iranian origin and is believed to have referred to a prehistorical human society in Central Asia. The term was widely used in scientific literature from the 18th century onwards to denote Central Asia. European scholars borrowed the term from the historical works of Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur; the annotated English translation of his &quot;Shajare-i Türk&quot; was published in 1729 and quickly became an oft-used source for European scholars.

Friedrich Max Müller, the German Orientalist and philologist, published and proposed a new grouping of the non-Aryan and non-Semitic Asian languages in 1855. In his work &quot;The Languages of the Seat of War in the East&quot;, he called these languages &quot;Turanian&quot;. Müller divided this group into two subgroups, the Southern Division and the Northern Division. In the long run, his evolutionist theory about languages&#x27; structural development, tying growing grammatical refinement to socio-economic development, and grouping languages into &#x27;antediluvian&#x27;, &#x27;familial&#x27;, &#x27;nomadic&#x27;, and &#x27;political&#x27; developmental stages, proved unsound. Nonetheless, his terminology stuck, and the terms &#x27;Turanian peoples&#x27; and &#x27;Turanian languages&#x27; became parts of common parlance. Another proposed group, the Ural-Altaic languages, was later derived from Müller&#x27;s Northern Division subgroup.

Like the term Aryan is used for Indo-European, Turanian is used chiefly as a linguistic term, synonymous with Ural-Altaic. However, the Ural-Altaic theory has been scientifically disproven. Concepts of areal linguistics and typology even if in a genetic sense of these terms might be considered as obsolete.

Turanism originated in the work of the Finnish nationalist and linguist Matthias Alexander Castrén, who championed the ideology. He concluded that the Finns originated in Central Asia (more specifically in the Altai Mountains) and far from being a small isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the Magyars, Turks, and Mongols. It implies not only the unity of all Turkic peoples (as in pan-Turkism), but also the alliance of a wider Ural-Altaic family believed to include all speakers of the &quot;Turanian languages&quot;.

Although Turanism is a political movement for the union of all Ural-Altaic peoples, there are different opinions about the movement&#x27;s inclusivity. The early Turanist Ziya Gökalp opined that Turanism is for Turkic peoples only, as other Turanian peoples (Finns, Hungarians, Mongolians and so on) are too different culturally. In contrast, his contemporary Lothrop Stoddard gave the following description during World War I:Right across northern Europe and Asia, from the Baltic to the Pacific and from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean, there stretches a vast band of peoples to whom ethnologists have assigned the name of &quot;Uralo-Altaic race&quot;, but who are more generally termed &quot;Turanians&quot;. This group embraces the most widely scattered folk—the Ottoman Turks of Constantinople and Anatolia, the Turcomans of Central Asia and Persia, the Tatars of South Russia and Transcaucasia, the Magyars of Hungary, the Finns of Finland and the Baltic provinces, the aboriginal tribes of Siberia and even the distant Mongols and Manchus. Diverse though they are in culture, tradition, and even physical appearance, these peoples nevertheless possess certain well-marked traits in common. Their languages are all similar, and, what is of even more import, their physical and mental make-up displays undoubted affinities.

== By region ==

=== Europe ===
==== Finland ====
Turanism has its roots in the Finnish nationalist Fennophile and Fennoman movement, and in the works of Finnish nationalist and linguist Matthias Alexander Castrén. Castrén conducted more than seven years of fieldwork in western and southern Siberia between 1841 and 1849. His extensive field materials focus on Ob-Ugric, Samoyedic, Ketic, and Turkic languages. He collected valuable ethnographic information, especially on shamanism. Based on his research, he claimed that the Finnic, Ugric, Samoyed, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic languages were all of the same &#x27;Altaic family&#x27;. He concluded that the Finns originated in Central Asia (in the Altai Mountains), and far from being a small, isolated people, they were part of a larger polity that included such peoples as the Magyars, Turks, Mongols, and so on. Based on his research, he championed the ideology of Turanism, the belief in the ethnic unity and the future greatness of the Ural-Altaic peoples. As Castrén put it:

Castrén was of the opinion that Russia was seeking systematically to prevent all development towards freer conditions in Finland, and concluded from this that the Finns must begin to prepare a revolt against Russia. According to him, it was to be linked with a favourable international crisis and would be realised as a general revolt against Russian rule, in which the non-Russian peoples from the Turks and Tatars to the Finns would take part. This political vision of his was shared by some other intellectuals. Fennomans like Elias Lönnrot and Zachris Topelius shared this or an even bolder vision of coming greatness. As Topelius put it:

==== Hungary ====

Hungarian Turanism () was a Romantic nationalist cultural and political movement which was most active from the second half of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th century. It was based on the age old and still living national tradition about the Asian origins of the Magyars. This tradition was preserved in medieval chronicles (such as Gesta Hungarorum and Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum, and the Chronicon Pictum) as early as the 13th century. This tradition served as the starting point for the scientific research about the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people, which began in the 18th century, both in Hungary and abroad. Sándor Kőrösi Csoma (the writer of the first Tibetan-English dictionary) traveled to Asia in the strong belief that he could find the kindred of the Magyars in Turkestan, amongst the Uyghurs. As a scientific movement, Turanism was concerned with the research about Asia and its culture in the context of Hungarian history and culture. Political Turanism was born in the 19th century, in response to the growing influence of Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism, which were seen by Hungarians as very dangerous to the state and nation of Hungary because the country had large ethnic German and Slavic populations. Political Turanism was a romantic nationalist movement, which accentuated the importance of the common ancestry and the cultural affinity of the Hungarians with the peoples of the Caucasus, Inner and Central Asia, like the Turks, Mongols, Parsi and the like, and called for closer collaboration and political alliance with them, as a means to secure and further shared interests, and counter the imminent threats posed by the policies of Western powers like Germany, the British Empire, France and Russia.

The idea of a Hungarian Oriental Institute originated with Jenő Zichy. This idea did not come true. Instead, a kind of lyceum was formed in 1910, called &quot;Turáni Társaság&quot; (Hungarian Turan Society, also called Hungarian Asiatic Society). The Turan society concentrated on Turan as geographic location where the ancestors of Hungarians might have lived.

The movement received impetus after Hungary&#x27;s defeat in World War I. Under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon (1920), the new Hungarian state constituted only 32.7% of the territory of historic, pre-treaty Hungary, and it lost 58.4% of its total population. More than 3.2 million ethnic Hungarians (one-third of all Hungarians) resided outside the new boundaries of Hungary in the successor states under oppressive conditions. Old Hungarian cities of great cultural importance like Pozsony (a former capital of the country), Kassa, and Kolozsvár (present-day Bratislava, Košice, and Cluj-Napoca respectively) were lost. Under these circumstances, no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for both the Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the unjust terms of the treaty and restore the integrity of Hungary.

On 1 June 1924, the &quot;Magyar-Nippon Társaság&quot; (Hungarian Nippon Society) was founded by private persons in order to strengthen Hungarian-Japanese cultural relations and exchanges.

Turanism was never embraced officially because it was not in accord with the Christian conservative ideological background of the regime, but it was used by the government as an informal tool to break the country&#x27;s international isolation, and build alliances. Hungary signed treaties of friendship and collaboration with the Republic of Turkey in 1923, with the Republic of Estonia in 1937, with the Republic of Finland in 1937, with Japan in 1938, and with Bulgaria in 1941.

After World War II, the Soviet Red Army occupied Hungary. The Hungarian government was placed under the direct control of the administration of the occupying forces. All Turanist organisations were disbanded by the government, and the majority of Turanist publications was banned and confiscated. In 1948, Hungary was converted into a communist one-party state. Turanism was portrayed and vilified as an exclusively fascist ideology although Turanism&#x27;s role in the interwar development of far-right ideologies was negligible.

==== Turkey ====
Traditional history cites its early origins amongst Ottoman officers and intelligentsia studying and residing in 1870s Imperial Germany. The fact that many Ottoman Turkish officials were becoming aware of their sense of &quot;Turkishness&quot; is beyond doubt of course, and the role of subsequent nationalists, such as Ziya Gökalp is fully established historically. As the Turkish historian Hasan Bülent Paksoy put it, an aspiration emerged that the Turkic peoples might &quot;form a political entity stretching from the Altai Mountains in Eastern Asia to the Bosphorus&quot;. During the late 19th century, the works of renowned Hungarian Orientalist and linguist Ármin Vámbéry contributed to the spreading of Turkish nationalism and Turanism. Vámbéry was employed by the British Foreign office as an advisor and agent. He was paid well for his accounts about his meetings with members of the Ottoman elite and Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and for his essays concerning Ottoman politics. The Ottoman Empire fell into ever deepening decline during the 19th century. There were reform and modernization attempts as early as the 1830s (Tanzimat), but the country was lowered to an almost semi-colonial state at the turn of the century (the state accumulated an enormous amount of debt and state finances were placed under direct foreign control), and the great powers freely preyed on her, occupying or annexing parts of her territory at will (e.g. Cyprus). At the time, the Russian and British empires were antagonists in the so-called &quot;Great Game&quot; to cultivate influence in Persia and Central Asia (Turkestan). Russia and Britain systematically fanned the rivalling nationalisms of the multi-ethnic empire for their own ends, and this led to the strengthening of Turkish nationalism as a result. The nationalist movement of the Young Turks aimed for a secularized nation-state, and constitutional government in a parliamentary democracy.

The political party of the Young Turks, the Committee of Union and Progress, embraced Turanism, and a glorification of Turkish ethnic identity, and was devoted to protecting the Turkic peoples living under foreign rule (most of them under Russian rule as a result of Russia&#x27;s enormous territorial expansion during the 16th and 19th centuries), and to restoring the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s shattered national pride.

The Turkish version of Turanism was summed up by American politicians at the time of First World War as follows: &quot;It has been shown above that the Turkish version of Turanism contains two general ideas: (a) To purify and strengthen the Turkish nationality within the Ottoman Empire, and (b) to link up the Ottoman Turks with the other Turks in the world. These objects were first pursued in the cultural sphere by a private group of &#x27;Intellectuals&#x27;, and promoted by peaceful propaganda. After 1913, they took on a political form and were incorporated in the programme of the C.U.P.&quot;, but Ottoman defeat in World War I briefly undermined the notion of Turanism.

After World War I, Turkish nationalists and Turanists joined the Basmachi movement in Central Asia, to help their struggle against the Soviets. The most prominent amongst them was Enver Pasha, the former Ottoman war minister.

Turanism forms an important aspect of the ideology of the modern Turkish Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), whose youth movement is informally known as the Grey Wolves. Grey Wolf (the mother wolf Asena) was the main symbol of the ancient Turkic peoples.

In the wake of the Turkish-assisted victory by Azerbaijan in its war with Armenia in 2020, &quot;a certain &#x27;Turan&#x27; (greater Turkic world) euphoria took hold on social media,&quot; Tanchum, a senior fellow at the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy and a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said.

=== Americas ===
Some Pan-Turanists proposed that Native Americans may have possible genetic and linguistic connection with the Turkic and other nomadic tribes in Asia. They have pointed to Native American culture, dance, and customs as being similar to those found in Siberia and Northeast Asia, although since changed after the migration of the Native Americans from Siberia to the Americas; examples of Native American peoples whose customs are cited include Melungeon people, as well as the Inuit and Quechua.

==Pseudoscientific theories==
Turanism has been characterized by pseudoscientific theories. According to other opinions the scientific work of the scholar members (like Jenő Cholnoky, Lajos Ligeti, Zoltán Felvinczi Takács and others) of the Hungarian Turanian Society belonged to the frontline of the scientific life of the era. According to the Turanian or Ural-Altaic kinship theories, &quot;Turanians&quot; include Bulgarians, Estonians, Mongols, Finns and Turks. Though the underlying scientific theories are widely questioned or rejected in contemporary scholarship, Turanism still has extensive support in certain Turkic-speaking countries. Referred to as Pseudo-Turkologists, these scholars stamp all Eurasian nomads and major civilizations in history as being of Turkic or Turanian origin. In such countries, Turanism has served as a form of national therapy, helping its proponents cope with the failures of the past.

<text>Brigadier Guy Hudleston Boisragon VC (5 November 1864 – 14 July 1931) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Boisragon was 27 years old, and a lieutenant in the Indian Staff Corps, British Indian Army, and 5th Gurkha Rifles during the Hunza-Naga Campaign, India when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 2 December 1891 during the attack on Nilt Fort, India, Lieutenant Boisragon led the assault, forcing his way through difficult obstacles to the inner gate, when he returned for reinforcements, moving fearlessly to and fro under heavy cross-fire until he had collected sufficient men to drive the enemy from the fort.

He later achieved the rank of brigadier.

<text>Charles George Bonner (29 December 1884 – 7 February 1951) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

On 8 August 1917 in the Bay of Biscay, Atlantic, Lieutenant Bonner, now a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, was with (one of the &#x27;Q&#x27; or &#x27;mystery&#x27; ships playing the part of an unobservant merchantman) when she was shelled by an enemy submarine. The lieutenant was in the thick of the fighting and throughout the whole of the action his pluck and determination had a considerable influence on the crew. For his actions, Bonner was awarded the Victoria Cross. Ernest Herbert Pitcher also received the Victoria Cross for his involvement.

He later achieved the rank of captain in the Merchant Navy.

==Memorials==
Bonner, who died at home in Edinburgh in 1951 aged 66, was cremated at Warriston Crematorium. His ashes were buried in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Aldridge, his birthplace, in the West Midlands.

In November 2007, a commemorative plaque to Captain Bonner was unveiled in Aldridge, where his life, bravery and achievements are specifically celebrated in the annual Remembrance Day parade.

In December 2009, a memorial plaque to Bonner and two other recipients of the Victoria Cross, James Thompson and John Henry Carless, was unveiled at the Town Hall in Walsall, England.

<text>Albert Chalmers Borella, VC, MM (7 August 1881 – 7 February 1968) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Victoria, Borella was one of 64 Australians to receive the Victoria Cross for their actions during the First World War, doing so while serving with the 26th Battalion around Villers-Bretonneux in July 1918. After the war, Borella returned to Australia, initially farming a property in Victoria before rejoining the Army during the Second World War and serving in a number of garrison units in Australia. He was demobilised in 1945 and worked as a public servant until he retired in 1956. He died in 1968 at the age of 86.

==Early life==
Albert Chalmers Borella was born at Borung, Victoria. His parents were Louis Borella and Annie Borella née Chalmers. After attending state schools at Borung and Wychitella, Borella became a farmer, working around Borung and Echuca. He also enlisted as a part-time soldier in the Victorian Rangers, serving for a period of 18 months. He travelled to Melbourne in early 1910 and became a firefighter in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, remaining in the city until early 1913 when he travelled to the Northern Territory to take up a pastoral lease, working a property on the Daly River until early 1915 when his financial situation forced him to leave the land.

==First World War==
Borella enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in Townsville, Queensland, on 15 March 1915. He had to go to some effort to do so because at the outbreak of the First World War the military authorities were not accepting volunteers from the Northern Territory. Borella accepted a job as a cook for a survey party in Tennant Creek and in January 1915 he set out for Darwin to volunteer for active service. With Charlie, an Aboriginal man, he walked and swam across flooded rivers. After borrowing a horse at Powell Creek, just north of Renner Springs, he rode to Katherine where he caught the mail coach to the railhead at Pine Creek. He sailed from Darwin to Townsville on 8 March 1915 with four other men who were among the first 15 volunteers for active service from the Northern Territory.

Initially serving in the ranks as a private, Borella served with the 26th Battalion at Gallipoli from 12 September 1915 until being evacuated with jaundice on 19 November. He did not rejoin his unit until 5 February 1916, and then served on the Western Front in France, being wounded in the Battle of Pozières Heights on 29 July. He achieved promotion from corporal to sergeant and was commissioned as an officer – second lieutenant – on 7 April 1917, and to lieutenant on 28 August 1917. He attended officer training in the United Kingdom. Borella received a Military Medal for conspicuous bravery on 11 May 1917, was Mentioned in Despatches on 1 June 1917, awarded the Victoria Cross on 16 September 1918 for actions in July 1918 during a peaceful penetration operation prior to the start of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive.

His citation for the Victoria Cross, gained in 1918 in Villers-Bretonneux, France, at the age of 37, reads in part: 

He received his VC at Sandringham from King George V. Three of Borella&#x27;s brothers also served during the war: Charles and James in the 7th Battalion, and Rex in the 8th Light Horse. All survived and returned to Australia.

==Later life==
At the end of the war Borella was invalided back to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on New Year&#x27;s Day 1919. From 1920, Borella began farming on a soldier settlement block at Hensley Park, near Hamilton in Victoria. In 1924, he stood for the seat of Dundas in the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the National Party candidate, but was defeated. On 16 August 1928, he married Elsie Jane Love, with whom he would later have four sons.

In late 1939, Borella changed his surname by deed poll to &quot;Chalmers-Borella&quot; in honour of his late mother, who had died when he was four years old. Borella enlisted in the Second World War, and served in Australia from October 1939 to May 1945, obtaining the rank of captain. He initially served in the 12th Australian Garrison Battalion until July 1941 when he was posted to the Prisoner of War Group, based at Rushworth, Victoria, before being posted to the 51st Garrison Company, based at Myrtleford, Victoria.

After being demobilised, Borella moved to Albury, New South Wales, working there as a public servant in the Commonwealth Department of Supply and Shipping, serving in the role of inspector of dangerous cargoes until he retired in 1956. Borella died on 7 February 1968 and was buried at the Presbyterian Cemetery, North Albury, New South Wales. His wife and two of their children survived him. A plaque was unveiled in Jingili, Northern Territory, in 1968, commemorating Borella. A street in Albury was renamed Borella Road and a plaque placed on a nearby memorial in 1977. His Victoria Cross is privately held.

==Borella Ride==
In August 2014, the Northern Territory Government announced it would commemorate Albert Borella&#x27;s service with &quot;The Borella Ride&quot;, a re-enactment of aspects of his ride from the Tennant Creek area of the Northern Territory to Darwin. The ride will be made in February–March 2015. A television advertisement raising awareness of Borella and the forthcoming re-enactment began on 4 August.

On 3 February 2015, Borella&#x27;s Victoria Cross was escorted to the Parliament House of the Northern Territory in an armed convoy. The VC and its accompanying medal group, and a Luger pistol brought home by Borella from the Western Front, remained on public display in the Parliament House for two months. The Borella family, including Rowan Borella – the surviving son of Borella – accompanied the Borella Ride from its departure on 20 February until its arrival on 3 March in Darwin.

==Documentary==

On 10–11 November 2016, the documentary &quot;Albert Borella VC – an Incredible Journey&quot;, aired on Channel 9 in the Northern Territory and nationally on 9Now. The film was made by Military Myths Defeated, a Territory-based company.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Drummond Borton (1 July 1883 – 5 January 1933) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Borton was born at Cheveney, Kent to British officer Arthur Close Borton, the eldest son of Sir Arthur Borton and Adelaide Beatrice Drummond, a grandchild of Robert Kaye Greville. Borton was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in 1902 with whom he served in the Second Boer War. In 1908 he left the Army as unfit for general service.

At the start of the First World War, Borton was fruit farming in the United States. He returned to England and re-joined The King&#x27;s Royal Rifles in 1914. After further service with the regiment he became an observer with The Royal Flying Corps in France, where he broke his neck in three places when his aircraft crashed and was declared unfit. Despite this he went to Gallipoli as a lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, where he won the Distinguished Service Order serving with the RNAS Armoured Cars. Borton was appointed Second-in-Command of the 2nd/22nd London Regiment (The Queen&#x27;s) in June 1916, serving in France and Palestine.

He was a 34-year-old lieutenant colonel in the 2/22nd (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment, British Army, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 November 1917 at Palestine, Borton deployed his battalion for attack and at dawn led his companies against a strongly held position. When the leading waves were checked by withering fire, he moved freely up and down the line under heavy fire and then led his men forward, capturing the position. At a later stage he led a party of volunteers against a battery of field-guns in action at point-blank range, capturing the guns and the detachments. His fearless leadership was an example to the whole brigade.

He died on 5 January 1933 at Southwold in Suffolk, aged 49.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment Museum, Clandon Park, Guildford, Surrey.

Borton&#x27;s younger brother was Air Vice Marshal Amyas Borton. He married Lorna Lockhart in 1915.

<doc id="1182871" wikidata="Q2355810" url="?curid=1182871" title="Hard-core predicate">
<text>In cryptography, a hard-core predicate of a one-way function &quot;f&quot; is a predicate &quot;b&quot; (i.e., a function whose output is a single bit) which is easy to compute (as a function of &quot;x&quot;) but is hard to compute given &quot;f(x)&quot;. In formal terms, there is no probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm that computes &quot;b(x)&quot; from &quot;f(x)&quot; with probability significantly greater than one half over random choice of &quot;x&quot;. In other words, if &quot;x&quot; is drawn uniformly at random, then given &quot;f(x)&quot;, any PPT adversary can only distinguish the hard-core bit &quot;b(x)&quot; and a uniformly random bit with negligible advantage over the length of &quot;x&quot;.

A hard-core function can be defined similarly. That is, if &quot;x&quot; is chosen uniformly at random, then given &quot;f(x)&quot;, any PPT algorithm can only distinguish the hard-core function value &quot;h(x)&quot; and uniformly random bits of length &quot;|h(x)|&quot; with negligible advantage over the length of &quot;x&quot;.

A hard-core predicate captures &quot;in a concentrated sense&quot; the hardness of inverting &quot;f&quot;.

While a one-way function is hard to invert, there are no guarantees about the feasibility of computing partial information about the preimage &quot;c&quot; from the image &quot;f(x)&quot;. For instance, while RSA is conjectured to be a one-way function, the Jacobi symbol of the preimage can be easily computed from that of the image.

It is clear that if a one-to-one function has a hard-core predicate, then it must be one way. Oded Goldreich and Leonid Levin (1989) showed how every one-way function can be trivially modified to obtain a one-way function that has a specific hard-core predicate. Let &quot;f&quot; be a one-way function. Define &quot;g(x,r) = (f(x), r)&quot; where the length of &quot;r&quot; is the same as that of &quot;x&quot;. Let &quot;xj&quot; denote the &quot;j&quot;th bit of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;rj&quot; the &quot;j&quot;th bit of &quot;r&quot;. Then

formula_1

is a hard core predicate of &quot;g&quot;. Note that &quot;b(x, r)&quot; = &lt;&quot;x, r&quot;&gt; where &lt;·, ·&gt; denotes the standard inner product on the vector space (Z2)&quot;n&quot;. This predicate is hard-core due to computational issues; that is, it is not hard to compute because &quot;g(x, r)&quot; is information theoretically lossy. Rather, if there exists an algorithm that computes this predicate efficiently, then there is another algorithm that can invert &quot;f&quot; efficiently.

A similar construction yields a hard-core function with &quot;O(log |x|)&quot; output bits. Suppose &quot;f&quot; is a strong one-way function. Define &quot;g(x, r)&quot; = &quot;(f(x), r)&quot; where |&quot;r&quot;| = 2|&quot;x&quot;|. Choose a length function &quot;l(n)&quot; = &quot;O(log n)&quot; s.t. &quot;l(n)&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. Let

formula_2

Then &quot;h(x, r)&quot; := &quot;b1(x, r) b2(x, r) ... bl(|x|)(x, r)&quot; is a hard-core function with output length &quot;l(|x|)&quot;.

It is sometimes the case that an actual bit of the input &quot;x&quot; is hard-core. For example, every single bit of inputs to the RSA function is a hard-core predicate of RSA and blocks of &quot;O(log |x|)&quot; bits of &quot;x&quot; are indistinguishable from random bit strings in polynomial time (under the assumption that the RSA function is hard to invert).

Hard-core predicates give a way to construct a pseudorandom generator from any one-way permutation. If &quot;b&quot; is a hard-core predicate of a one-way permutation &quot;f&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; is a random seed, then

formula_3

is a pseudorandom bit sequence, where &quot;fn&quot; means the n-th iteration of applying &quot;f&quot; on &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;b&quot; is the generated hard-core bit by each round &quot;n&quot;.

Hard-core predicates of trapdoor one-way permutations (known as trapdoor predicates) can be used to construct semantically secure public-key encryption schemes.

<text>The Dog on the Tuckerbox is an Australian historical monument and tourist attraction, located at Snake Gully, approximately eight kilometres from Gundagai, New South Wales as described in the song of the same name.

==Cultural origin==
The inspiration for the statue has been traced to a doggerel poem, &quot;Bullocky Bill&quot;, published anonymously by &quot;Bowyang Yorke&quot; in 1857. Other references state that the poem was published in 1880, in the &quot;Gundagai Times&quot;, but confirmation of either date is hard to find. The poem humorously describes a series of misfortunes faced by a bullock driver, culminating in his dog either sitting on or spoiling the food in his tucker-box - an Australian colloquialism for a box that holds food, similar to a lunchbox, but larger.

:BILL THE BULLOCKY
:(By &quot;Bowyang York&quot;).
:As I was coming down Conroy&#x27;s Gap
:I heard a maiden cry:
:&quot;There goes Bill the Bullocky,
:He&#x27;s bound for Gundagai.
:A better poor old dog
:Never cracked an honest crust;
:A tougher poor old dog
:Never drug a whip through dust.
:&quot;His team got bogged at the five mile creek,
:Bill lashed and swore and cried,
:&#x27;If Nobby don&#x27;t get me out of this
:I&#x27;ll tattoo the old dogs hide.&#x27;
:But Nobby strained and broke his yoke,
:And poked out the leader&#x27;s eye;
:And the dog sat in the tucker box
:Five miles from Gundagai.&quot;

That poem was generally considered rude and vulgar, although still less so than popularly sung versions, where the dog &quot;shat in&quot; instead of &quot;sat on&quot; the tucker-box.

A less offensive and more accomplished poem by Jack Moses, published in the 1920s, made reference to the Bowyang Yorke poem although, for an unknown reason, he titled it &quot;Nine Miles from Gundagai&quot;. Moses&#x27; poem has the dog guarding the tuckerbox by sitting on it. The poem was very popular and was the inspiration for the statue. Jack O&#x27;Hagan&#x27;s song, &quot;Where the Dog Sits on the Tuckerbox (5 miles from Gundagai)&quot;, was published in 1937, and Moses&#x27; poem was included in his collection, &quot;Nine Miles from Gundagai&quot;, published in 1938.

==The monument==
A dog monument was first erected at a site nine miles from Gundagai in 1926.

Gundagai stonemason Frank Rusconi suggested a memorial using the legend of the Dog on the Tuckerbox in 1928; and in 1932 the proposal was taken up by the community. The &quot;Gundagai Independent&quot; of 11 August 1932 wrote: 
The Back to Gundagai Committee chose the Five Mile camping site rather than the Nine Mile Peg as a location for the monument on the basis that it was more convenient to the Hume Highway and closer to the town, thereby more beneficial to tourism.

A nationwide competition was held to obtain the most suitable inscription for the monument. The chosen inscription on the base of the monument was written by Brian Fitzpatrick of Sydney. The inscription says:

:&quot;Earth&#x27;s self upholds this monument 
:&quot;To conquerors who won her when
:&quot;Wooing was dangerous, and now
:&quot;Are gathered unto her again.&quot;

The dog section of the monument was modelled by Rusconi and cast at &#x27;Oliver&#x27;s Foundry&#x27; in Sydney. The base was created by a pattern maker at Oliver’s Foundry by the name of Richard Fowler. 

&quot;The Dog on the Tuckerbox&quot; monument was erected in 1932 as part of &#x27;Back to Gundagai&#x27; week, and a large crowd &quot;gathered to her again&quot; to witness the unveiling by Prime Minister Joseph Lyons on 28 November 1932. It was planned to donate money placed in the wishing well at the base of the monument to the Gundagai District Hospital. A souvenir shop was also opened nearby.
Copyright on the monument was vested in the Gundagai Hospital, who for many years received a useful income from receipt of royalties from firms using the iconic image.

==Later history==
A &quot;Dog on the Tuckerbox&quot; festival has been held each year since 1992, the 60th anniversary of the monument. In November 2005, the annual festival included a two-day Snake Gully Cup Racing Carnival and festivities at the Dog on the Tuckerbox Centre.

The statue was vandalised on 28 July 2019 by being dislodged from its plinth, suffering minor damage, and had its grand re-unveiling on 17 August 2019 following repairs.

A more deliberate piece of vandalism was perpetrated a few months after its unveiling in 1933, when the name of Prime Minister Lyons was chiselled away from the base of the monument, presumably as a political act. Rusconi reported that the only proper repair was to take the marble slab away to be reworked.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Abraham Boulger VC (4 September 1835, in Kilcullen, County Kildare – 23 January 1900) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

In 1857 Boulger was serving with the 84th Regiment of Foot (later 2nd Bn, The York and Lancaster Regiment), during the Indian Mutiny and was involved in the Siege of Cawnpore and the Relief of Lucknow. He was a 21 year old Lance-Corporal when he was awarded the VC for the following service:
Lance-Corporal Abraham BoulgerDate of Acts of Bravery, from 12th July to 25th September, 1857For distinguished bravery and forwardness; a skirmisher, in all the twelve actions fought between 12th July, and 25th September, 1857. (Extract from Field Force Orders of the late Major-General Havelock, dated 17 October 1857.)

Boulger became sergeant major of the 84th Foot, and in November 1872 was commissioned as the Regiment&#x27;s Quartermaster. He served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War with his regiment, now titled the York and Lancaster Regiment. While remaining quartermaster, he was promoted to honorary captain in November, 1882, and honorary Major in March 1883, &#x27;in recognition of his services during the recent campaign in Egypt&#x27;. He retired with the honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in November 1887.

Boulger died in Moate, County Westmeath, Ireland, on 23 January 1900, aged 64. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the York &amp; Lancaster Regiment Museum in Rotherham, England.

<doc id="1182884" wikidata="Q6531009" url="?curid=1182884" title="Leslie Maygar">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Cecil Maygar, (27 May 1868 – 1 November 1917) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the VC for facilitating the rescue of a dismounted man while under severe rifle fire in 1902 during the Second Boer War. He later served at Gallipoli during the First World War, and died of wounds after being strafed during the Battle of Beersheba as part of the Sinai and Palestine campaign.

==Early life==
He was born on 27 May 1868, at Dean Station, near Kilmore, Victoria. The seventh child of Edwin Willis and Helen Maygar (née Grimshaw), his full name was Edgar Leslie Cecil Willis Walker Maygar. The Victorian birth certificate is recorded as Edgar Leslie Cecil W. MAYGER, registered at Greensborough, Victoria. Both of his parents were originally from Bristol, England. There was a long-standing family belief that his father&#x27;s family were political refugees from Hungary. As the surname Maygar is likely of Hungarian origin, his ancestors possibly fled Hungary in the late Middle Ages. The Maygar family tree can be traced to Wells, Somerset in 1640. 

Educated at state schools in Kilmore and Alexandra, his family moved north to the Strathbogie Ranges region of Ruffy when he was about 20 years old, where he worked on his father&#x27;s property. In March 1891 he enlisted in the Victorian Mounted Rifles.

==Military service==
Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Maygar unsuccessfully attempted to volunteer for active service on several occasions with the first and second contingents of the Victorian Mounted Rifles that were departing for South Africa, but was prevented from doing so due to a decaying tooth. He was later accepted into the fifth contingent and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. He arrived in Cape Town in March 1901. Maygar&#x27;s unit was constantly in action for the next 12 months, seeing service north of Middelburg, East Transvaal, then at Rhenoster Kop, Klippan, Kornfontein and Drivelfontein, before being transferred to Natal in August.

He was 29 years old, and a lieutenant in the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:

Maygar&#x27;s award was presented by Lord Kitchener and he was later also mentioned in despatches. He returned to Australia in March 1902.

Maygar worked as a grazier at Ruffy near Euroa, while continuing to serve in the 8th Light Horse, Victorian Mounted Rifles, and was promoted to captain in 1905. In July 1912, he transferred to the 16th (Indi) Light Horse Regiment. Following the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, lowering his age by four years in order to do so. Appointed as a captain in the 4th Light Horse Regiment on 20 August 1914, he sailed for Egypt in October. He later fought at Gallipoli, and was promoted to major. On 17 October 1915, he was given temporary command of the 8th Light Horse Regiment, with his promotion to lieutenant colonel being confirmed in December. During the evacuation he commanded a small party of forty men, with instructions to hold the trenches at all costs until early morning, in order to allow the successful embarkation of the remainder of the force.

Following the withdrawal, Maygar commanded the 8th Light Horse Regiment during the Sinai and Palestine campaign throughout 1916 and 1917. He also temporarily commanded the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on three occasions. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1917, and was mentioned in despatches on three occasions. He qualified for the Volunteer Officers&#x27; Decoration in July 1917. Maygar was wounded during the Battle of Beersheba by a German aircraft on 31 October 1917 and died in hospital in Karm, Palestine, on 1 November. He is buried in the Beersheba War Cemetery, now in Israel.

==Legacy==
The Australian Army base located at Broadmeadows (a northern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria) is named Maygar Barracks in honour of Leslie Maygar; the then Captain Maygar had helped establish Broadmeadows as an Army base in 1914 to train soldiers for the First World War. There is a VC Memorial dedicated to Leslie Maygar, along with other local Victoria Cross winners in Euroa, which as of April 2012 was seeking funding to upgrade the site. A hill in the Strathbogie Ranges is named Maygars Hill in his honour, as well as a winery of the same name nearby which uses his name and image. There is also a major road called Maygar Street in north Brisbane, Queensland. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

<text>Turquoise ( ) is a cyan color, based on the mineral of the same name. The word &quot;turquoise&quot; dates to the 17th century and is derived from the French , meaning &#x27;Turkish&#x27;, because the mineral was first brought to Europe through Turkey from mines in the historical Khorasan province of Iran (Persia) and Afghanistan today. The first recorded use of &quot;turquoise&quot; as a color name in English was in 1573.

The X11 color named turquoise is displayed on the right.

==Turquoise gemstones==
Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrous phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formula CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4H2O. It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gem and ornamental stone for thousands of years owing to its unique hue.
In many cultures of the Old and New Worlds, this gemstone has been esteemed for thousands of years as a holy stone, a bringer of good fortune or a talisman. The oldest evidence for this claim was found in ancient Egypt, where grave furnishings with turquoise inlay were discovered, dating from approximately 3000 BCE. In the ancient Persian Empire, the sky-blue gemstones were earlier worn round the neck or wrist as protection against unnatural death. If they changed color, the wearer was thought to have reason to fear the approach of doom. Meanwhile, it has been discovered that turquoise can change color. The change can be caused by light, or by a chemical reaction brought about by cosmetics, dust, or the acidity of the skin.

Turquoise is a stone and color that is strongly associated with the domes and interiors of large mosques in Iran, Central Asia, and Russia.

<text>The Australian Conservative Party was founded as a registered political party in 1989, under the leadership of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland from 1968 to 1988. It remained active until 1991 when it was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) when the membership fell below the required 500 members. The party then attempted to reform under the &quot;Australian Conservative Alliance&quot;, also known as Australia First, in 1995.

After two years since his ousting as Leader of the National Party, former Queensland Premier, Sir Joh, announced the launching of a new conservative political party, the Australian Conservative Party, in front of one-hundred people in Hervey Bay, Queensland. He created the party alongside Lin Powell.
