<text>In politics of the United States, party switching is any change in party affiliation of a partisan public figure, usually one who holds an elected office. Use of the term &quot;party switch&quot; can also connote a transfer of holding power in an elected governmental body from one party to another.

==History==
===19th century===
The first two major parties in the United States were the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. The Federalists experienced success in the 1790s but lost power in the 1800 elections and collapsed after the War of 1812. Many former Federalists, including John Quincy Adams, became members of the Democratic-Republican Party. After the 1824 presidential election, the Democratic-Republicans fractured between supporters of Adams and supporters of Andrew Jackson. Jackson&#x27;s followers formed the Democratic Party, while those who supported Adams formed the National Republican Party. Two short-lived but significant third parties, the Anti-Masonic Party and the Nullifier Party, also arose during this period. In the 1830s, opponents of Jackson coalesced into the Whig Party.

The United States experienced another period of political realignment in the 1850s. The Whigs collapsed as a national party due to sectional tensions regarding slavery. The Republican Party and the American Party both sought to succeed the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democratic Party, and the Republicans eventually became the most popular party in the Northern United States. The Republicans absorbed many Northern Whigs, as well as some anti-slavery Democrats and much of the Free Soil Party. Notable Whigs who joined the Republican Party include Abraham Lincoln and William Seward, while notable Democrats who joined the Republican Party include Hannibal Hamlin and Galusha A. Grow. Many Southern Whigs became Democrats, though some formed the Constitutional Union Party to contest the 1860 presidential election. During the Reconstruction Era that followed the American Civil War, many Republicans and African Americans held office in the South. Republicans dissatisfied with Radical Republican President Ulysses S. Grant formed the Liberal Republican Party for the 1872 presidential election, and many of these Liberal Republicans later joined the Democratic Party. After the end of Reconstruction the Republican Party generally dominated the North, while a resurgent Democratic Party dominated the South.

By the late 19th century, as the Democratic and Republican parties became more established, party switching became less frequent. Nonetheless major conflicts in both major parties occurred in the 1890s, largely over the issue of monetary policy, and Republican supporters of free silver formed the Silver Republican Party. Many of these, including Henry M. Teller and Fred Dubois, later joined the Democratic Party.

===20th century===
Following Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s loss to William Howard Taft in the 1912 Republican Party presidential primaries, Roosevelt and his followers broke off from the Republican party to form the Bull Moose Party. Wisconsin senator Robert M. La Follette also launched a presidential bid under the Progressive Party in 1924 after both the Republican Party and Democratic Party nominated conservative candidates. A period of realignment commenced following the onset of the Great Depression, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt constructed the successful New Deal coalition. Over the ensuing decades, Roosevelt&#x27;s Democrats embraced several tenets of modern American liberalism, while the Republican Party tended to favor conservatism.

The transition into today&#x27;s Democratic Party was cemented in 1948, when Harry Truman introduced a pro-civil rights platform and, in response, many Democrats walked out and formed the Dixiecrats. Most rejoined the Democrats over the next decade, but in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. The civil rights movement had also deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, and Republican politicians developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party. These approaches are known as the Southern strategy. Anti-civil rights members left the Democratic Party in droves, and Senator Strom Thurmond, the Dixiecrats&#x27; presidential candidate from 1948, joined the Republican Party.

==Notable party switchers==

Liberal Republican Robert M. La Follette ran for president as the candidate of the Progressive Party in 1924, while remaining a Republican in the Senate. There have also been several instances of politicians continuing to be a member of a political party while running other campaigns as an independent. The most prominent examples include southern Democratic segregationists Strom Thurmond in 1948 and George Wallace in 1968, who remained in the Democratic Party for statewide campaigns but mounted national presidential campaigns as independents. Wallace later ran in the 1972 Democratic primaries. Senator Joseph Lieberman in 2006 ran for Senate in Connecticut under the party Connecticut for Lieberman, although still identifying as a Democrat.

Other political figures, such as Ed Koch, Jim Leach, Zell Miller, Colin Powell, did not formally leave their parties, but supported a candidate from another party. Miller and Koch, though Democrats, supported Republican George W. Bush&#x27;s 2004 reelection campaign, while Powell and Leach supported Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. This received much media attention in 2004, when Democrats for Bush and Republicans for Kerry groups were formed. In New Hampshire, former Republican Governor Walter Peterson has expressly supported Democrat John Lynch in his bids for governor. In Virginia, the state&#x27;s first Republican governor since Reconstruction, Linwood Holton, has since 2001 frequently supported Democrats in statewide races – his son-in-law, Tim Kaine, has been elected to the governorship and the U.S. Senate in that time, and served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President in the 2016 election – and endorsed Barack Obama in 2008. Similarly, in 1860, former Democratic President Martin Van Buren ended up supporting Abraham Lincoln due to Van Buren&#x27;s disagreements with Democratic policies on secession. Other examples include former Republican Senator from Minnesota David Durenberger supporting John Kerry in 2004 and former Democratic Attorney General Griffin Bell supporting George W. Bush in 2004. Moreover, former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and Democrat Mike Espy endorsed incumbent Republican Governor of Mississippi Haley Barbour for reelection in 2007.

During Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency one governor and two congressmen switched parties due mostly to their support or opposition to the president&#x27;s policies. On August 3, 2017, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced that he had rejoined the Republican Party after having been elected as a Democrat less than a year prior. He made the announcement at a rally in Huntington alongside Trump and claimed that he was returning to the GOP because he could not help the president while he was a Democrat. The announcement came as a surprise even to his own staff. This also made Justice the first Republican governor of West Virginia since Cecil Underwood in 2001. In 2019, Democratic congressman Jeff Van Drew left the party because of his opposition to Trump&#x27;s first impeachment and his own political beliefs. Both Justice and Van Drew were reelected as Republicans in 2020. Conversely, Republican congressman Justin Amash of Michigan left the GOP to become an independent on July 4, 2019 due to his opposition to Trump. Amash joined the Libertarian Party in 2020 and did not seek reelection, rejoining the Republican Party four years later.

==Motivations==
Politicians may switch parties if they believe their views are no longer aligned with those of their current party. Richard Shelby of Alabama left the Democratic Party for the Republican Party, arguing that his former party had shifted more towards liberalism. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado switched parties from Democratic to Republican following increased hostility within the Democratic Party in Colorado over Campbell&#x27;s increased conservative voting record and independent streak while the local party became more liberal.

A disaffected incumbent who might not hold a leadership position or feels ignored or mistreated by the majority party might join the minority party with the expectation of holding a leadership position in the minority party and if currently elected, having the complete support of the minority party for re-election, who would certainly want to have more elected officials in their ranks. The party the person left is likely to consider the party-switcher to be a Benedict Arnold.

Some politicians have also switched parties to improve their chances for reelection. Arlen Specter, a former US Senator of Pennsylvania, cited his uncertainty of winning a Republican primary as one reason for his move to the Democratic Party.

<text>The valona is a popular narrative song- and poetry-form of the Mexican state of Michoacán. Its main characteristics are a bitter sense of humor, bawdy content, and social concerns. The lyrics of a Valona are composed as groupings of ten-line strophes, each line made up of eight syllables; musically, all valonas are sung (in fact, almost recited) to just a single tune, with an instrumental refrain after each strophe, which can vary.

As a narrative popular genre, the valona is literarily and musically related to the Mexican corrido. In a broader stylistic sense, it is akin with other Mexican genres composed in ten minor-verse strophes (&quot;décimas&quot; or &quot;espinelas&quot;), such as some huapangos and the son arribeño, along with certain other Latin American genres, such as the Chilean run-run and the rhapsodes of the Argentine payadores.

===Early political career===
Hudak ran in the provincial election of 1995 in the riding of Niagara South. He defeated Liberal Aubrey Foley by 1,181 votes. Aged 27, Hudak was the second-youngest Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) elected in 1995, the youngest being John Baird.

The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Mike Harris, and Hudak was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to Minister of Health Jim Wilson. He later served as Parliamentary Assistant to Wilson&#x27;s successor, Elizabeth Witmer.

===1999 election===
Hudak was re-elected with a 5,878 vote margin in the redistributed riding of Erie—Lincoln in the 1999 provincial election, and was named Minister of Northern Development and Mines on June 17, 1999. As part of the party&#x27;s Provincial Mandate and environmental program, Mr. Hudak voted to enact the Drive Clean Program.

On February 8, 2001, he was named Minister of Culture, Tourism and Recreation. As Tourism Minister, Hudak visited 101 festivals and events across Ontario in the summer of 2001 on his More to Discover Tour. Immediately following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Hudak called together leaders in the tourism industry and executed a plan that provided $14 million for marketing to help the industry recover. During his time in the Ministry, he awarded nearly $300 million to rebuild aging infrastructure in communities across the province through SuperBuild&#x27;s Sports, Culture and Tourism Partnership fund.

He supported Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to become party leader in 2002. On April 15, 2002, new Premier Ernie Eves appointed him Minister of Consumer and Business Services.


===2003 election===
The Tories lost the provincial election of 2003, although Hudak was easily re-elected by a margin of 4,058 votes. He was appointed as PC Caucus Chair and critic responsible for Public Infrastructure Renewal, and later elevated to the role of critic for both Municipal Affairs and Housing and Public Infrastructure Renewal. In opposition, he introduced a bill to create a new retail system for Ontario Vintners Quality Alliance wines in competition with the provincial distribution system. He also proposed Bill 75, also known as the &quot;Homestead Act&quot;, which aimed to cap residential property assessment increases at five per cent.

Hudak again supported Jim Flaherty&#x27;s bid to become party leader in the 2004 PC leadership election. In August 2005, PC leader John Tory appointed Hudak to the lead role of Official Opposition Finance Critic.

===2007 election===
Although the Tories lost the 2007 Ontario election, Hudak won his riding with a 10,022 vote margin, gaining 51 per cent of the popular vote.

===Party leadership===

On April 2, 2009, Hudak launched his campaign for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party. Considered by many as the frontrunner in the race, Hudak had secured the support of over half the caucus at the launch of his campaign. Hudak was endorsed by federal Conservative cabinet ministers John Baird and Tony Clement, who had served alongside him in the cabinets of Harris and Eves. During the campaign, Hudak was quoted as saying that if the PCs want to regain government, they would have to make inroads in major cities and begin &quot;reaching out to new Canadian communities... I want to make sure that the next wave of new Canadians – whether from the Czech Republic or India or China – will see the Ontario PC party as home.&quot;

The leader was chosen by a preferential ballot on June 27, 2009, in Markham, Ontario. Hudak placed first out of the four candidates defeating Frank Klees, Christine Elliott, and Randy Hillier. On July 1, he assumed the position as leader of the opposition.

===Official opposition===
In August 2009, shortly after taking power, Hudak criticized the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) after a string of controversies. The government had forced the resignation of several board members and, according to Canadian broadcaster CTV, Hudak &quot;suggested the government was trying to pre-empt another eHealth-like scandal, and promised his party would &quot;shine the light&quot; on any Liberal misspending.&quot; Following Hudak&#x27;s opposition, Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan fired the corporation&#x27;s CEO, Kelly McDougald, &quot;for cause&quot;. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) also reported that a freedom-of-information request by Hudak&#x27;s Tories was behind the shakeup. According to Hudak, the Liberals &quot;knew it would be coming up in the opening session of the legislature, [so they] put it out today to head off the scandal... But you&#x27;re not going to stop the scandalous spending until [Premier Dalton] McGuinty sets the tone by firing one of his ministers.&quot;

On September 10, 2009, Hudak delivered his first major speech as Party leader to the Economic Club of Canada. In his speech, Hudak attacked the Liberals for unnecessary spending at eHealth and OLG, as well as giving a $263-million grant to a video game developer.

On October 19, 2009, Hudak launched a petition to support the new West Lincoln Memorial Hospital (WLMH) in West Niagara. The petition called on the McGuinty government as well as the Minister of Health to stop the Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant Local Health Integration Network from delaying the construction of the new hospital.

During the fall 2009 legislative session, Hudak launched one of his first major platform pieces, the PC Caucus Small Business Jobs Plan, which he stated was essential to Ontario&#x27;s economic recovery. Also during the fall of 2009, Hudak and his party ramped up their opposition to the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The HST, came into effect July 1, 2010, blended the previous eight per cent provincial sales tax with the five per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST).

By the end of 2009, polls indicated that under Hudak&#x27;s leadership, the Ontario PC Party jumped from a distant second to a double-digit lead.
The Party’s first year under Hudak’s leadership wrapped up with the Conservative’s Northern Ontario jobs plan, a plan to restore jobs and economic growth to Ontario’s vast north. &quot;The big picture here is that [when] developing economies like China and India grow, and the American economy rebounds, there will be a massive appetite for Ontario’s wood products and minerals and other resources&quot;, Hudak said.

Hudak also criticized the McGuinty government’s approach to Ontario&#x27;s nuclear industry. In line with his plan for the North, Hudak commented that “Reducing Northern Ontario&#x27;s high energy costs is key to making industries there more profitable and preventing future mill closures.”

In March 2010 by-elections, the Tories retained retired MPP Bob Runciman&#x27;s riding of Leeds-Grenville, boosting their support by 19 points to 67 per cent of the vote. The party lost a second race in Ottawa West-Nepean to former Ottawa mayor and former MPP Bob Chiarelli, although they improved their showing over the results of the 2007 election. In a third by-election held in Toronto Centre on the same day, the Progressive Conservative candidate came in third with fifteen percent of the vote.

Later in April, Hudak and the Ontario PC party focused Question Period on the Local Health Integrated Network (LHIN), a system of regional health authorities established by the McGuinty government. Offering examples of sole-sourced contracting, Hudak hammered the government for broken promises and removing money from front-line care. He said the amount of money paid out in six-figure salaries to LHIN executives and managers had nearly doubled since 2006 and promised to dissolve the LHINs if he were to win the Ontario general election in 2011.

On Canada Day, 2010, the controversial harmonized sales tax (HST) came into effect across the province of Ontario. Tim Hudak responded by saying, “Dalton McGuinty will do what he does best, raising taxes on hard-working families. People will feel it at first at the pumps overnight. Next they will get hit with it on their utility bills.&quot;

Hudak also vowed to eliminate the eco-tax, a fee on certain environmentally harmful products brought in by McGuinty, if he were elected Premier.

In August 2010, Ontario Ombudsman André Marin exposed a bylaw that enables local health bureaucrats to hold closed-door meetings on hospital closures. Controversial decisions on hospital restructuring in the Niagara-area health unit could now be open to judicial review due to the use of the bylaw by the Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant Local Health Integration Network. In response to Marin&#x27;s report, Hudak committed to abolish the LHINs and redirect $200 million in savings back to the health system.

On May 26, 2011, Hudak proposed a highly controversial plan to implement mandatory street-cleaning &quot;work gangs&quot; made up of provincial inmates, replacing current voluntary programs. This program was described as modern-day &quot;chain gangs&quot; by Hudak&#x27;s critics, who pointed out that such a program would be costly to implement and could pose significant security risks to the public, along with eliminating these entry-level jobs from the paid workforce.

A Nanos Research poll released on August 16, 2011, found that fewer than one in four voters describe Hudak as the most trustworthy leader. Among women, the number was one in five.

Hudak faced criticism from party members after the Progressive Conservatives won only one out of five seats being contested in a series of by-elections on August 1, 2013. 10 party members petitioned the party to allow a leadership review at the party&#x27;s policy convention in the fall and two MPPs, Frank Klees and Randy Hillier, have called on Hudak to allow the review to proceed.

In April 2014, Hudak and fellow MPP Lisa MacLeod were being sued for libel by Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne for saying she “oversaw and possibly ordered the criminal destruction of [gas plant] documents.” Wynne denies she had any knowledge or involvement of the allegations made. Hudak and the PC face a subsequent lawsuit over statements made on its website brought forward by the Working Families Coalition. The group has funded attack ads (with union financial backing), and been accused by the PC party of supporting the Liberal Party.

===2011 election===

Hudak&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives consistently led in public opinion polls for months leading up to the October 6, 2011, provincial election. However, by the time the writ was dropped for the election the party&#x27;s lead had begun to shrink. The Liberal Party made gains in polling during the election campaign and on election night won a minority government, one seat shy of a majority government. The Liberals took 53 seats, the Tories won 37 and the NDP took 17 seats.

===2014 election and resignation===

Following his party&#x27;s defeat in the 2011 election, Hudak invited Tom Long, Leslie Noble and other architects of the party&#x27;s 1995 victory to design his campaign for the following election. Hudak&#x27;s Conservatives ran on a platform promising to create a million jobs and to reduce the public service by 100,000 jobs through attrition - resulting in his math being challenged by the other parties and various analysts.

Hudak won his Niagara West-Glanbrook seat while his party lost 10 seats. After the election, several Conservative MPPs said they had not known about Hudak&#x27;s &quot;Million Job Plan&quot; ahead of time and criticized Hudak for not consulting his caucus about the election platform he was running on. Hudak announced he would resign as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party after losing to Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s Liberals, which secured a majority government, but said he will continue as an MPP.

Hudak did not take a position in the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet named by his interim successor, Jim Wilson.

===Backbench MPP===
In October 2015, Hudak tabled a private member&#x27;s bill that would legalize ridesharing companies such as Uber, property rental services such as Airbnb, and parking-sharing services such as Rover at the provincial level and with provincial regulatory standards.

Hudak announced on August 9, 2016, that he would be resigning his seat in the Ontario legislature, effective September 16, 2016, to become the Chief Executive Officer of the Ontario Real Estate Association.

=== Political views ===
Numerous pundits have labelled Hudak as a blue Tory who is on the right-wing of the PC Party of Ontario, though Hudak has called himself a &quot;purple Tory&quot;. He has proposed income splitting for young couples and families, and campaigned to scrap the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, replacing it with a courts-based system of settling complaints. Hudak&#x27;s wife, Deb Hutton, was a senior adviser to Mike Harris, and he is seen by some as the new standard-bearer for the Mike Harris Common Sense Revolution.

When he was running for the PC leadership in 2009, Hudak told the Association for Reformed Political Action that he is anti-abortion and had signed petitions calling for the defunding of abortions. However, on July 18, 2011, during the lead-up to the October 6 provincial election, Hudak stated that he &quot;may have&quot; signed petitions calling for an end to abortion funding. He refused to answer follow-up questions from media regarding his views on abortion, but promised that he would not reopen the abortion debate if elected premier.

In December 2012, Hudak announced that if he were to form government he would allow beer, wine and spirits to be sold at corner stores throughout the province. Hudak said he would sell part of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario or some of its stores to the private sector and is open to the idea of a full sell-off of the LCBO. Although the McGuinty government had rejected the idea of selling alcohol in corner stores in the summer of 2012, weeks after Hudak&#x27;s announcement, they launched a pilot project to allow alcohol to be sold in supermarkets.

In April 2013, Hudak met with the &quot;National Post&quot;&#x27;s editorial board to discuss education issues in Ontario. Among other things, he was asked about Ontario&#x27;s publicly funded Roman Catholic school system, which operates in parallel with the public system. Hudak simply stated that parents from other religions or denominations have &quot;legitimate concerns&quot;.

== Post-MPP Career ==

After the Ontario legislature in 2016, Hudak became the CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association. In 2021 it was announced that he would chair a provincial committee to promote tourism following COVID-19 lockdowns. 

==Personal life==
Hudak married Deb Hutton on October 5, 2002 and together they have two daughters, Miller and Maitland.

He is an avid Twitter, Facebook, and social media enthusiast. In 2010, he became the first Canadian politician to have his own iPhone application.

<doc id="1169983" wikidata="Q669275" url="?curid=1169983" title="Rhodri Molwynog">
<text>Rhodri Molwynog (&quot;Rhodri the Bald and Grey&quot;; reigned c. 720 – c. 754, died circa 754), also known as Rhodri ap Idwal (&quot;Rhodri son of Idwal&quot;) was an 8th century king of Gwynedd. He was listed as a King of the Britons by the &quot;Annals of Wales&quot;.

This era in the history of Gwynedd is very obscure and, given the lack of reliable information available, several serious histories of medieval Wales – including John Davies&#x27;s – do not mention Rhodri at all, while others – including John Lloyd&#x27;s – mention him only in passing, quoting the undated entry of the &quot;Annals of Wales&quot; recording his death. Phillimore&#x27;s reconstruction places the entry in the year 754. The &quot;Annals&quot; do not mention the death of an earlier king within a reasonable time frame, so the date that he became king is not known, nor is the name of his predecessor.

Rhodri&#x27;s name also appears in genealogies such as those in Jesus College MS. 20 (where he is described as the son of Idwal Iwrch son of Cadwaladr Fendigiad) and the Harleian genealogies (where he is described as the son of Tutgual son of Cadwaladr). It remains, however, unclear to what extent the genealogies at that point were recording the lineage of the Cuneddion dynasty regardless of their rule or recording the rulers regardless of their connection to the main branch of the dynasty.

The &quot;Annals of Wales&quot; mention a war in kingdom of Cornwall around 722 without giving the names of the individuals involved. The &quot;Brut y Saeson Chronicle&quot; says that in 721 there was &quot;an extensive war between Rhodri Molwynawg and the Saxons in Cornwall&quot;. The &quot;Brut Aberpergwm&quot; also recorded this event but, while it was accepted for a time by the editors of &quot;The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales&quot;, Thomas Stephens has since shown that it was one of Iolo Morganwg&#x27;s many forgeries.

The &quot;Rotri&quot; appearing in the &quot;Annals&quot; has sometimes been misidentified as a ruler of Alt Clut (modern Dumbarton Rock), the Brythonic kingdom later known as Strathclyde.

He was succeeded by Caradog ap Meirion.

<doc id="1169984" wikidata="Q3001792" url="?curid=1169984" title="Markov blanket">
<text>In statistics and machine learning, when one wants to infer a random variable with a set of variables, usually a subset is enough, and other variables are useless. Such a subset that contains all the useful information is called a Markov blanket. If a Markov blanket is minimal, meaning that it cannot drop any variable without losing information, it is called a Markov boundary. Identifying a Markov blanket or a Markov boundary helps to extract useful features. The terms of Markov blanket and Markov boundary were coined by Judea Pearl in 1988. A Markov blanket can be constituted by a set of Markov chains.

== Markov blanket ==

A Markov blanket of a random variable formula_1 in a random variable set formula_2 is any subset formula_3 of formula_4, conditioned on which other variables are independent with formula_1:

formula_6

It means that formula_3 contains at least all the information one needs to infer formula_1, where the variables in formula_9 are redundant.

In general, a given Markov blanket is not unique. Any set in formula_4 that contains a Markov blanket is also a Markov blanket itself. Specifically, formula_4 is a Markov blanket of formula_1 in formula_4.

== Markov boundary ==
A Markov boundary of formula_1 in formula_4 is a subset formula_16 of formula_4, such that formula_16 itself is a Markov blanket of formula_1, but any proper subset of formula_16 is not a Markov blanket of formula_1. In other words, a Markov boundary is a minimal Markov blanket.

The Markov boundary of a node formula_22 in a Bayesian network is the set of nodes composed of formula_22&#x27;s parents, formula_22&#x27;s children, and formula_22&#x27;s children&#x27;s other parents. In a Markov random field, the Markov boundary for a node is the set of its neighboring nodes. In a dependency network, the Markov boundary for a node is the set of its parents.

=== Uniqueness of Markov boundary ===
The Markov boundary always exists. Under some mild conditions, the Markov boundary is unique. However, for most practical and theoretical scenarios multiple Markov boundaries may provide alternative solutions. When there are multiple Markov boundaries, quantities measuring causal effect could fail.

<doc id="1169985" wikidata="Q5054561" url="?curid=1169985" title="Causal Markov condition">
<text>The Markov condition, sometimes called the Markov assumption, is an assumption made in Bayesian probability theory, that every node in a Bayesian network is conditionally independent of its nondescendants, given its parents. Stated loosely, it is assumed that a node has no bearing on nodes which do not descend from it. In a DAG, this local Markov condition is equivalent to the global Markov condition, which states that d-separations in the graph also correspond to conditional independence relations. This also means that a node is conditionally independent of the entire network, given its Markov blanket.

The related Causal Markov (CM) condition states that, conditional on the set of all its direct causes, a node is independent of all variables which are not effects or direct causes of that node. In the event that the structure of a Bayesian network accurately depicts causality, the two conditions are equivalent. However, a network may accurately embody the Markov condition without depicting causality, in which case it should not be assumed to embody the causal Markov condition.

== Motivation ==

Statisticians are enormously interested in the ways in which certain events and variables are connected. The precise notion of what constitutes a cause and effect is necessary to understand the connections between them. The central idea behind the philosophical study of probabilistic causation is that causes raise the probabilities of their effects, all else being equal. 

A deterministic interpretation of causation means that if &quot;A&quot; causes &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; must &quot;always&quot; be followed by &quot;B&quot;. In this sense, smoking does not cause cancer because some smokers never develop cancer. 

On the other hand, a probabilistic interpretation simply means that causes raise the probability of their effects. In this sense, changes in meteorological readings associated with a storm do cause that storm, since they raise its probability. (However, simply looking at a barometer does not change the probability of the storm, for a more detailed analysis, see:).

== Implications ==
=== Dependence and Causation ===
It follows from the definition that if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are in V and are probabilistically dependent, then either &quot;X&quot; causes &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; causes &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are both effects of some common cause &quot;Z&quot; in V. This definition was seminally introduced by Hans Reichenbach as the Common Cause Principle (CCP) 

=== Screening ===
It once again follows from the definition that the parents of &quot;X&quot; screen &quot;X&quot; from other &quot;indirect causes&quot; of &quot;X&quot; (parents of Parents(&quot;X&quot;)) and other effects of Parents(&quot;X&quot;) which are not also effects of &quot;X&quot;.

== Examples ==
In a simple view, releasing one&#x27;s hand from a hammer causes the hammer to fall. However, doing so in outer space does not produce the same outcome, calling into question if releasing one&#x27;s fingers from a hammer &quot;always&quot; causes it to fall. 

A causal graph could be created to acknowledge that both the presence of gravity and the release of the hammer contribute to its falling. However, it would be very surprising if the surface underneath the hammer affected its falling. This essentially states the Causal Markov Condition, that given the existence of gravity the release of the hammer, it will fall regardless of what is beneath it.

<text>Mark Colton (17 March 1961 – 5 August 1995) was a British racing driver and software author.

He was killed in practice for Craigantlet Hillclimb speed event in Northern Ireland after his Pilbeam hit a telegraph pole.

Colton&#x27;s best year was 1994, when he was runner-up to David Grace.

Outside motorsport, Colton was an influential figure in the development of software for personal computers, particularly those made by Acorn Computers, being the author of the Acornsoft &quot;View&quot; range and &quot;View Professional&quot; for the BBC Micro while working at Protechnic in the early 1980s. View Professional was the predecessor of the &quot;PipeDream&quot; integrated suite for the Cambridge Z88 portable computer, Acorn Archimedes and IBM PC compatibles. Having founded Colton Software to market PipeDream, the company followed up with a range of applications - &quot;Wordz&quot;, &quot;Resultz&quot; and &quot;Recordz&quot; - comprising the &quot;Fireworkz&quot; suite, this being released for RISC OS and Microsoft Windows. In a tribute to Colton, Charles Moir, founder of Computer Concepts - the &quot;chief rival&quot; to Colton Software - called him &quot;one of only a handful of people in this country who could and did develop decent, competitive, mainstream applications&quot;.

<doc id="1170016" wikidata="Q172155" url="?curid=1170016" title="Roger Penske">
<text>Roger Searle Penske (born February 20, 1937) also known as &quot;The Captain&quot; is an American auto racing team owner, businessman, and former professional driver. Penske is the owner of Team Penske, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, IndyCar, and other auto racing-related businesses. Penske is the founder and chairman of the Penske Corporation, a holding company for his various businesses. Penske is also a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient.

==Early life and education==
Penske was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio, in 1937. Born to a devout Episcopalian family, Penske was heavily involved with his church as a boy, singing in the church&#x27;s choir and serving in the ministry as an acolyte. His father, Jay, was a successful corporate executive for a metal fabrication company and encouraged his son to become an entrepreneur. As a teenager he bought older cars, repaired them and sold them at a profit from his family&#x27;s home in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Shaker Heights High School in 1955 and is a 1959 graduate of Lehigh University, where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

==Racing career==
Penske&#x27;s first racing venture was in hillclimbing, but then ran road course racing at the Vineland Raceway in Vineland, New Jersey, as a member of the Philadelphia Region of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) in Porsches. Penske made his first professional racing start at the now-abandoned Marlboro Motor Raceway in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named him SCCA Driver of the Year in 1961. He competed in two Formula One Grands Prix and won a NASCAR Pacific Coast Late Model race at Riverside in 1963. He never ran the Indianapolis 500: he was offered a rookie test at Indianapolis with the Dean Van Lines team. 

Penske continued racing until 1965, when he retired as a driver, to concentrate on his first Chevrolet dealership in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Racing teams==
Penske Racing debuted in 1966 at the 24 Hours of Daytona. He developed one of the most successful teams in IndyCar Series and NASCAR racing. He is the most successful team owner at the Indianapolis 500 with 20 victories. He is known by his nickname of &quot;The Captain&quot;. Penske also served as a race strategist for his IndyCar team, most recently for driver Will Power.

Penske won his first NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship with driver Brad Keselowski on November 18, 2012.

On September 16, 2018, driver Brad Keselowski won the South Point 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, giving Penske his 500th race victory as an owner across all racing series. Later the same season, Joey Logano would clinch the championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway, winning Penske his second championship in the Cup series.

==Penske Corporation==
Penske is chairman of Penske Corporation, based in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Some of the company&#x27;s holdings include a significant stake in publicly-traded Penske Automotive Group, an international company that operates automobile dealerships in the United States, Canada, and parts of Europe; Penske Truck Leasing, a truck sales, leasing, and fleet maintenance company; Penske Motor Group which operates auto dealerships in California and Texas. On November 4, 2019, Penske acquired the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5-mile course in Speedway, Indiana, the Indianapolis 500-mile race and IndyCar from the Hulman Family for an undisclosed amount.

==Personal life==
As of October 2023, Penske&#x27;s estimated net worth is $3.8 billion.

Penske Racing donated $500,000 to Restore Our Future, Mitt Romney&#x27;s Super PAC. He was discussed as a potential candidate for Mayor of Detroit but declined to run. Penske endorsed Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election after receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019. He contributed $45,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

<text>The American Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act (), also known as the Cheeseburger Bill, sought to protect producers and retailers of foods—such as McDonald&#x27;s Corporation—from an increasing number of suits and class action suits by obese consumers. The Act stated that food-producing or retailing corporations cannot be legally held responsible for obesity, heart disease, or other health-related issues caused by consumption of their food, save for situations where actual food quality or handling was held responsible for such issues. To date these suits have been turned down by the courts, sometimes in strong terms. The Act never became a law.

The Act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March 2005, but did not receive a Senate vote. 

The bill was reintroduced in 2005 by Florida Republican Congressman Ric Keller. Keller had taken the maximum level of PAC donations up to $300,000 for his personal campaign funding from restaurants including McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, and Burger King. On October 19, 2005, it passed the House with a 306–120 vote, but again failed to achieve a Senate vote.

Many state legislatures have considered their own versions of the bill.

<doc id="1170026" wikidata="Q1426193" url="?curid=1170026" title="Herschel (Mimantean crater)">
<text>Herschel () is the largest impact crater on the Saturnian moon Mimas. It is located on Mimas&#x27;s leading hemisphere, centered on the equator at 112° longitude. It is named after the 18th-century astronomer William Herschel, who discovered Mimas in 1789.

== Geology ==

Herschel is the second-largest crater relative to its parent body of any equilibrium planetary moon in the Solar System after Tethys&#x27;s crater Odysseus. It is so large that astronomers have expressed surprise that Mimas was not shattered by the impact that caused it. It measures across, almost one third the diameter of Mimas. Its walls are approximately high, parts of its floor are deep, and its central peak rises above the crater floor. If there were a crater of an equivalent scale on Earth it would be over in diameter – wider than Canada – with walls over high. 

=== Origin ===
The impact that formed Herschel must have nearly disrupted Mimas entirely. Large chasms (termed &quot;chasmata&quot;) that may be stress fractures due to shock waves from the impact traveling through it and focusing there can be seen on the opposite side of Mimas. The impact is also suspected of having something to do with the current &quot;Pac-Man&quot;–shaped temperature pattern on Mimas. Herschel has an estimated age of around 4.1 billion years.

== Media reception ==
The similarity between Mimas&#x27;s appearance and the Death Star in &quot;Star Wars&quot; due to the large size of Herschel has often been noted, both in the press and in NASA/JPL press releases. This is a coincidence, however, as the crater&#x27;s similarities were not discovered until 1980 after Voyager 1 gained line of sight, three years after the film was made.

<doc id="1170027" wikidata="Q119214" url="?curid=1170027" title="Bath County Pumped Storage Station">
<text>The Bath County Pumped Storage Station is a pumped storage hydroelectric power plant with a maximum generation capacity of 3,003 MW, an average of 2,772 MW, and a total storage capacity of 24,000 MWh. The station is located in the northern corner of Bath County, Virginia, on the southeast side of the Eastern Continental Divide, which forms this section of the border between Virginia and West Virginia. The station consists of two reservoirs separated by about in elevation. It was the largest pumped-storage power station in the world until 2021, when it was surpassed by the Fengning Pumped Storage Power Station.

Construction on the power station, with an original capacity of , began in March 1977 and was completed in December 1985 at a cost of $1.6 billion, Voith-Siemens upgraded the six turbines between 2004 and 2009, increasing power generation to 500.5 MW and pumping power to for each turbine. Bath County Station is jointly owned by Dominion Generation (60%) and FirstEnergy (40%), and managed by Dominion. It stores energy for PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

==Design==
The upper and lower reservoirs are created by earth and rock-filled embankment dams. The upper reservoir dam is high, long and has a structural volume of . The upper reservoir on Little Back Creek has a surface area of and storage capacity of . The lower reservoir dam on Back Creek is high and in length. It has a structural volume of and creates a reservoir with a surface area of and storage capacity of . Connecting the upper reservoir to the power station are three water conduits between long. The conduits each lead to a shaft which bifurcates into two penstocks (for a total of six) before reaching the turbines. Each penstock is in diameter and between in length. Maximum static pressure from the top of the water delivery system to the turbines is .

== Method of operation ==
Water is released from the upper reservoir during periods of high demand and is used to generate electricity. What makes this different from other hydroelectric dams is that during times of low demand, power is taken from coal, nuclear, and other power plants and is used to pump water from the lower to the upper reservoir. Although this plant uses more power than it generates, it allows these other plants to operate at close to peak efficiency for an overall cost savings. Back Creek and Little Back Creek, the water sources used to create the reservoirs, have a relatively small flow rate. However, since water is pumped between the reservoirs equally, the only water taken from these creeks now that the reservoirs are full is to replace the water lost to evaporation. During operation, the water level fluctuates by over in the upper reservoir and feet in the lower reservoir.

When generating power, the water flow can be as much as per minute (850 m3/s). When storing power, the flow can be as much as per minute (800 m3/s).

==Environment==
A fishing habitat was created downstream of the facility.
In times of drought water quality can be maintained by using nearby recreational reservoirs to supply extra water to the creeks. The creeks and recreational reservoirs have water quality sufficient for fish.

<doc id="1170029" wikidata="Q2570298" url="?curid=1170029" title="Westerleigh">
<text>Westerleigh is a clustered village in the civil parish of Westerleigh and Coalpit Heath (which includes Henfield) in the South Gloucestershire district, in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England, it contains sources of the Frome and has an endpoint of the Frome Valley Walkway. It is north of the M4, south of Yate and north-east of the city of Bristol. In the south it includes a steep hill of its own from the crest of the Cotswold hills which is designated an AONB.

==Background==
The village is first mentioned in a Saxon document of 887AD. At that time it was probably just a clearing in the woods with possibly a wooden church. Westerleigh is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.

In medieval times the village would probably have been a green with the houses and church around it, and prosperous. The northern wall and porch of St James church is from the 13th century, as is the carved stone pulpit. The church was rebuilt in the perpendicular style, with the tower (once used as the village lock up) added at a later date. The 700th anniversary was celebrated in 2004.

By 1600 the village supported a shoemaker, a blacksmith, a sawyer, a flour mill, a malt house and two public houses. In 1617, John Crandall was baptised to James and Eleanor Crandall at St. James the Great church, and became one of the founders of Westerly, Rhode Island, United States.

The discovery of coal in 1660 provided employment for the villagers, with further finds at Coalpit Heath and Parkfield providing more employment. The mines closed in the last century, when the coal was exhausted.

By 1876 occupations in the village included farmers, a bootmaker, shopkeepers, innkeepers, butchers, a plasterer, a blacksmith, a wheelwright, a market gardener and a carrier. At the end of the 19th century many of the old houses were demolished. At the beginning of the 20th century, the railway and mining provided most of the work. Now residents find work in nearby Yate, Chipping Sodbury and Bristol, and in the village itself.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from Dodington in the east, through &#x27;Westerleigh&#x27;. The total population for the ward at the 2011 census was 3,755. On 1 April 2023 the parish was renamed from &quot;Westerleigh&quot; to &quot;Westerleigh and Coalpit Heath&quot;.

==Amenities==
The village has two public houses: the New Inn and Ye Olde Inn. As well as Wot Not second-hand shop, and two garages. The village shop has now closed.

==Transport==
In the late 18th century roads were built to Downend. The Great Western and Midland Railways were constructed in the 19th century. Westerleigh Junction was a crossing point of east-west and north-south main lines. In particular it is considered to be the present end of the line from milepost zero at Derby. Westerleigh formerly had a goods depot on the Bristol &amp; Gloucester Railway. Demolished in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts, the site is now the home of one of Murco&#x27;s oil storage terminals.

Westerleigh is served by the WESTlink on-demand bus, available to the public Monday-Saturday.

<doc id="1170031" wikidata="Q7916129" url="?curid=1170031" title="Varsity (Cambridge)">
<text>Varsity is the oldest of Cambridge University&#x27;s main student newspapers. It has been published continuously since 1947 and is one of only three fully independent student newspapers in the UK. It moved back to being a weekly publication in Michaelmas 2015, and is published every Friday during term time.

&quot;Varsity&quot; has received recognition at the now defunct &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Media Awards.

== History==
&quot;Varsity&quot; is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest student newspapers. Its first edition was published on 17 January 1931, as Varsity: the Cambridge University Illustrated (later &quot;The Varsity Weekly&quot;, and then the &quot;Cambridge Varsity Post&quot;. However, the first few years saw &quot;Varsity&quot; get off to a shaky start. In 1932, a controversy about some of its stories resulted in the editor being challenged to a duel, and the following year the paper went bankrupt (having lost £100).

===Revival===
A variety of attempts to revive &quot;Varsity&quot; led to the paper resurfacing periodically over the following decade, but it was not until 1947 that the paper was re-established permanently in its current form. Harry Newman Jr (1921–2001), a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Business School, then studying for a postgraduate degree at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, decided that Cambridge needed a proper American-style campus newspaper modelled on &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. With the post-war rationing of newsprint, only publications that had existed before the War could be allocated paper, and so the obsolete publication name &quot;Varsity&quot; was used.

In a letter published in &quot;Varsity&quot; at the end of the year 1971–1972, Harry Newman wrote,

&quot;Varsity&quot;″s headquarters in 1947 was above the Scotch Hoose, &quot;a restaurant at the corner of the Market and Market Street&quot;. Newman goes on to note that Geoffrey Neame, &quot;a leading light among the Nightclimbers of Cambridge and the Gentlemen of Caius&quot;, was the first post-1947 layout editor. The first managing editor was the Scotsman &quot;Wee Willie Watson&quot;, a former fighter pilot. On 19 April 1947, &quot;Varsity&quot; reappeared, its first issue headlining the coming visit of the then Princess Elizabeth to the university (a visit that ultimately would be cancelled). Its first print run was of 5,000 copies.

===1950s–1960s===
In the 1950s, &quot;Varsity&quot;″s offices were in a former shop in St Edward&#x27;s Passage, next door to the Arts Theatre. The second editor (after Newman) was David Widdicombe, a Queens&#x27; College student who was also chairman of the Labour Club. In 1955, a one-off Oxford edition of the paper was produced by the then editor Michael Winner. Since then the paper has concentrated on the Cambridge audience.

In 1956, the staff, worried about debts, questioned &quot;Varsity&quot;″s legal status. Solicitors were consulted, who advised that any debts arising from its considerable turnover (advertising income, printing costs etc.) or damages awarded for libel etc. would be the personal responsibility of the current editor. &quot;Varsity&quot; was promptly converted into a limited liability company – &quot;Varsity Publications Ltd&quot;, with a share capital of £100. 50% of the shares were taken by the printers, 20% by the Don who was the senior treasurer and the rest, at £1 per head, by the staff at that time.

===1970s–1980s===
In the mid-1970s, &quot;Varsity&quot; merged with the radical campaigning student paper &quot;Stop Press&quot;. Thereafter, it was known as &quot;Stop Press with Varsity&quot; for several years, before reverting to its original title in the late 1980s.

===1990s–present===
&quot;Varsity&quot; moved back to being a weekly publication in Michaelmas 2015, after having been a fortnightly publication since Michaelmas 2012. &quot;Varsity&quot; is published every Friday during the University of Cambridge&#x27;s term time, so there are 21 issues a year.

The Lent term editor also edits a single edition at the start of Easter term, and a separate editor controls a special edition May Week issue (or, in some years, daily May Week issues) at the end of the academic year.

== Famous contributions ==
===Notable contributors===
Many of those who wrote for the paper during their student days have since gone on to achieve distinction in later life. Famous ex-editors include the former BBC news presenters Jeremy Paxman and David Frost, film director Michael Winner, the television presenter Richard Whiteley, former &quot;Financial Times&quot; editor Andrew Gowers, &quot;Independent&quot; editor Amol Rajan, &quot;i&quot; editor Oliver Duff, novelist Robert Harris, novelist and biographer Graham Lord, historian Jonathan Spence, Factory Records founder Tony Wilson and BBC1&#x27;s &quot;EastEnders&quot; executive producer Matthew Robinson. &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; fashion writer and author Suzy Menkes was the newspaper&#x27;s first female editor. Some of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s earliest poems and J. G. Ballard&#x27;s first published story were written for the paper. Plath also posed in a bathing suit for an article she wrote about summer fashion-wear for the ladies. Meanwhile, comic Peter Cook met his first wife while posing for a &quot;Varsity&quot; May Ball photo shoot.

The paper has also launched the careers of many news journalists, including in recent times former &quot;Observer&quot; Political Editor Gaby Hinsliff, &quot;Guardian&quot; New York correspondent Oliver Burkeman, &quot;Guardian&quot; music critic Alexis Petridis, author and columnist Iain Hollingshead, &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist Archie Bland, &quot;Sunday Times&quot; columnist Charlotte Ivers, the &quot;Independent&#x27;s&quot; New York business correspondent Stephen Foley, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; News Review Editor Martin Hemming, as well as former &quot;Independent&quot; columnist Johann Hari. The BBC and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reporter Andrew Gilligan was once a news editor. Other notable contributors who have had later success in other fields include Michael Frayn, Germaine Greer, Clive James, Gavin Lyall, Robert Jenrick and Charles III.

Some notable editors of the &quot;Varsity&quot; include Andrew Rawnsley (1983–4), Archie Bland (Michaelmas 2004), Amol Rajan (Lent 2005), Laura-Jane Foley (Lent 2004), and James Dacre (Michaelmas 2005).

===Stories broken===
====Early years====
Stories first revealed in &quot;Varsity&quot; have often gone on to receive coverage in the UK&#x27;s national press. In May 1953, &quot;Varsity&quot; was only the third newspaper in the world to carry a report on James Watson and Francis Crick&#x27;s discovery of the structure of DNA, after the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The discovery was made in Cambridge on 28 February 1953; the first Watson/Crick paper appeared in &quot;Nature&quot; on 25 April 1953. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London on 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; of London, on 15 May 1953, entitled &quot;Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life.&quot; The news reached readers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography, &quot;Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution&quot;, found a clipping of a six-paragraph &quot;New York Times&quot; article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline &quot;Form of &#x27;Life Unit&#x27; in Cell Is Scanned.&quot; The article only ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. &quot;Varsity&quot; ran its own 130-word front-page article on the discovery on 30 May 1953 under the headline &quot;X-Ray Discovery&quot;.

====Recent years====
In recent years, reports to capture wider attention have included the leak of the name of Cambridge&#x27;s latest vice-Chancellor, news about student protests concerning higher education funding, and a host of lighter reports about undergraduate excesses. In 2014 &quot;Varsity&quot; collaborated with Cambridge&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union to survey the rate of sexual assault at the university; the findings of the survey, attracted widespread attention from the national press.

In July 2021, Varsity broke a national story regarding the university&#x27;s proposed £400m deal with the United Arab Emirates. Varsity journalists were then credited when the story was covered by The Times. The news was later broken that the deal had been called off following revelations around the UAE&#x27;s links to Pegasus spyware through an interview with Vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope. The story appeared on the front cover of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, with Varsity journalists receiving writing credits.

== Current organisation==
&quot;Varsity&quot; is published by Varsity Publications Ltd, a not-for-profit company which directly funds The Varsity Trust, a UK registered charity with the principal object of furthering the education of students in journalism. The company also produces a number of other student publications such as &quot;The Mays&quot;—a collection of short stories and poems by Cambridge and Oxford students. &quot;The Mays&quot; have been published annually since 1992, and are most famous for launching the career of novelist Zadie Smith. Her work appears in the 1996 and 1997 short-story editions. These attracted the attention of a publisher, who offered her a contract for her first novel. Smith decided to contact a literary agent and was taken on by A. P. Watt. Smith returned to guest-edit the anthology in 2001.

Advertising in &quot;Varsity&quot; has traditionally been seen as highly useful by graduate recruiters hoping to attract Cambridge students. As a result, the newspaper is able to distribute free copies to members of the university (without relying on student union funding), and was the first student newspaper in the UK to produce a colour section. Hence, &quot;Varsity&quot; management and funding structure means that it is independent from both the university and Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union. In this respect it is unlike the vast majority of similar publications in other UK universities; the only other student newspapers to operate similarly are Oxford&#x27;s &quot;Cherwell&quot; and The Oxford Blue, as well as &quot;The Saint&quot; of the University of St Andrews.

Unlike most student newspapers, the design of the newspaper is allowed to change radically with the arrival of new student editors.

== Awards==
===20th century===
For several consecutive years in the 1950s and 1960s the paper won the award for Britain&#x27;s best student newspaper. (In the mid-1950s it was temporarily banned from entering for the award on grounds that it was &quot;too professional&quot; and other publications should be given a chance to win.)

===21st century===
In the 2001 Guardian Student Media Awards it was shortlisted in two categories for best feature writer (Rend Shakir) and best student critic (Alex Marshall) 
It was successful in the 2004 &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Media Awards where it won the prize for best columnist (Archie Bland) and came runner-up in best sports writer category (Sam Richardson). In 2005 Varsity writer Sam Richardson won the Guardian&#x27;s Student Diversity Writer of the Year award.

In 2006, Sophie Pickford was the runner-up for best sports writer of the year.

In 2007, &quot;Varsity&quot; won the &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Media Awards&#x27; Student Publication Design of the Year.

&quot;Varsity&quot; won six prizes at the &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Media Awards in November 2009, over a third of the prizes in session, was nominated for a further two, and former editor Patrick Kingsley was named Student Journalist of the Year. Michael Stothard won in the Best Reporter category; Zing Tsjeng was the Best Feature Writer; Ben Riley-Smith was Best Sports Reporter; while Charlotte Runcie was awarded Best Columnist, with Rob Peal runner-up.

==Current board and staff==
&quot;Varsity&quot; has a board of directors made up of university academics, long-term associates of the newspaper, and student members. As of March 2022, the chairman is Mike Franklin.

&quot;Varsity&quot;″s editors are not paid, but their work is supported by a full-time business manager and company secretary (responsible for sourcing advertising to fund the publications, running the office on a day-to-day basis, finance, accounts, tax and administration). The current business manager and company secretary is Mark Curtis.

&quot;Varsity&quot; is now based at the Old Examination Hall on the New Museums Site in the former Godwin Laboratory. Previously, &quot;Varsity&quot; was based at 11–12 Trumpington Street. The newspaper&#x27;s move from this &quot;temporary&quot; home, to the new offices, occurred in August 2007, after a 16-year tenancy.

<doc id="1170034" wikidata="Q5397317" url="?curid=1170034" title="Escobedo v. Illinois">
<text>Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that criminal suspects have a right to counsel during police interrogations under the Sixth Amendment. The case was decided a year after the court had held in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; that indigent criminal defendants have a right to be provided counsel at trial.

==Background==
Danny Escobedo&#x27;s brother-in-law, Manuel Valtierra, was shot and killed on the night of January 19, 1960. Escobedo was arrested without a warrant early the next morning and interrogated. However, Escobedo made no statement to the police and was released that afternoon.

Benedict DiGerlando, who was in custody and considered to be another suspect, later told the police that Escobedo had indeed fired the fatal shots because the victim had mistreated Escobedo&#x27;s sister. On January 30, the police again arrested Escobedo and his sister, Grace. While transporting them to the police station, the police explained that DiGerlando had implicated Escobedo and urged him and Grace to confess. Escobedo again declined, and he asked to speak to his attorney, but the police refused by explaining that although he was not formally charged yet, he was in custody and could not leave. His attorney went to the police station and repeatedly asked to see his client but was repeatedly refused access.

Police and prosecutors proceeded to interrogate Escobedo for fourteen-and-a-half hours and repeatedly refused his request to speak with his attorney. While being interrogated, Escobedo made statements indicating his knowledge of the crime. After conviction for murder, Escobedo appealed on the basis of being denied the right to counsel.

==Decision==
Escobedo appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, which initially held the confession inadmissible and reversed the conviction. Illinois petitioned for rehearing, and the court then affirmed the conviction. Escobedo appealed to the US Supreme Court, which overturned the conviction in a 5–4 decision. The majority opinion was written by Justice Arthur Goldberg. The ACLU had argued before the Court as amicus curiae in favor of Escobedo.

==Later developments==
This holding was later implicitly overruled by &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; in 1966, where the Supreme Court held that pre-indictment interrogations violate the Fifth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment. As Escobedo was questioned during a custodial interrogation, the result for him would have been the same.

In the years following the decision, Escobedo received 12 felony convictions, including federal charges of selling drugs. He was also convicted of taking indecent liberties with children. While free on an appeal bond with respect to those charges, Escobedo pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

<text>Neelakanta Ramakrishna Madhava Menon (4 May 1935 – 8 May 2019) was an Indian civil servant, lawyer and legal educator, considered by many as the father of modern legal education in India. He is the founder of National Law Universities system and first director of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) and the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal and the founder-vice-chancellor of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS). He has also served as Chairman of Indian Statistical Institute from 2002 to 2003.

Menon was awarded the Padma Shri in 2003 and Padma Bhushan in 2020 by the Government of India.

He was a member of the Law Commission of India and also member of several expert Committees including on Legal Aid (1973), Civil Services Examination Reform (2000-2001), and Criminal Justice Reform (2002-2003), Police Act Drafting Committee (2005-2006) and the Committee on Draft National Policy on Criminal Justice (2006-2007) 
and Committee on Restructuring of Higher Education in India appointed by the Government of India. He was a Central Secretariat Service officer. The new academic block of NLSIU is named after him.

==Biography==
Menon was born on 4 May 1935 at Trivandrum, Kerala in a middle-class Nair family to Bhavani Amma and Ramakrishna Menon as the fourth of their sixchildren. His father, a law graduate and a revenue officer working for the Travancore Corporation, died due to typhoid, when Menon was two years old and he was brought up by his mother, with the assistance of her brothers and sisters. His mother took up a job as a clerk at Travancore Corporation to bring up Appu, as he was known at home, and his three elder sisters and one younger brother; another one of his younger brothers died in childhood.

Menon schooling was at Sreemoolavilasam Government High School, Thiruvananthapuram from where he passed matriculation in 1949 and completed the pre-university course in 1950, when the erstwhile two-year course was realigned as a truncated one-year course. His graduate studies were at S. D. College, Alappuzha from where he passed with a BSc in zoology in 1953. He also passed the &quot;Hindi Visharad&quot; course conducted by the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha simultaneously with his graduate studies. He continued his studies at Government Law College, Ernakulam, but shifted to Government Law College, Thiruvananthapuram when the college was restarted in the capital city in 1953 and was the student editor of the college magazine in 1954–55. He passed the law course (BL) in 1955.

Menon died on 8 May 2019, four days after his 84th birthday, at Thiruvananthapuram, reportedly after battling liver cancer.

==Career==

===Law and civil service===
Menon started his career in 1955, as an apprentice to a locally known lawyer, V. Nagappan Nair, and assisted him for thirteenmonths. The next year, in 1956, he registered at the High Court of Kerala, in Ernakulam, as a lawyer and started practice under advocate Poovanpallil Neelakandan Pillai at the district court in Thiruvananthapuram. One year later, Menon appeared for the Civil Services Examination and got placed into the Central Secretariat Service in New Delhi. On the advice of his teacher and mentor, A.T. Markose, the first director of the Indian Law Institute and the author of &quot;Judicial Control of Administrative Action in India&quot;, he took up the job at Central Secretariat in New Delhi.

While working at the secretariat, Menon continued his studies at Campus College located at Gole Market, affiliated to Punjab University and secured a post graduate degree (MA) in political science with distinction, in 1960. Afterwards, Menon joined Faculty of Law, Aligarh Muslim University for further studies in law and passed the master&#x27;s degree in law (LLM) and, obtaining a UGC scholarship, continued research on the topic, &quot;White Collar Crime&quot;.

He has served as a member of the Committee for Implementing Legal Aid Schemes (CILAS), which was formed under the chairmanship of V. R. Krishna Iyer, by the Indira Gandhi government, in connection with the Garibi Hatao programme. He has also served as the secretary of the Bar Council of India Trust. During an interlude, he worked as the principal of the Government Law College, Pondicherry. When the Bar Council of India decided to establish a new law school in early 1980s, Menon&#x27;s services were sought and he is known to have set up the Bangalore-based National Law School of India University (NLSIU) with a government grant. The school was the first in India to use the Harvard Law School&#x27;s case study method, which later became the mainstream form of legal education in India. Menon worked at NLSIU for twelveyears as the director, moving after the institution gained university status.

In 1998, Menon was invited by the Government of West Bengal to set up the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) on the lines of the Bangalore initiative. As the first vice-chancellor, he is known to have developed its infrastructure and educational curriculum and held the post till 2003, when the Supreme Court of India asked him to take over the responsibility as the first director of the newly formed National Judicial Academy a training centre for judges where he worked till his retirement in 2006.

==Post-retirement positions==

After retiring from active government service in 2006, Menon was appointed by the Union Government as a member of the Commission on Centre-State Relations, a position he held till 2010. He also served as the Chairman of the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, and later, as the Chairman of the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. He headed the central government committee constituted to draft the National Policy on Criminal Justice and served as the Commission on Equal Opportunity. He was a member of Law Commission of India and was a member of the Committee on Restructuring of Higher Education in India as well as the Criminal Justice Reform committee. Later, Madhava Menon headed a Commission constituted as per a Supreme Court order of April 2014 to submit recommendations on government advertisements, on which report was submitted in October 2014.

Menon was a member of the Board of Governors of the International Organization of Judicial Trainers (IOJT), was an advisor to the Commonwealth Judicial Education Institute, Canada.

He was also a recipient of the Rotary Club Award for Vocational Excellence and the &quot;Plaque of Honour&quot; from the Bar Council of India. He received the degree of &quot;Doctor of Law&quot; (Honoris Causa) from the National Law School of India University in 2001.

The Government of India included Menon, in 2003, in the Republic Day honours list, for the civilian award of Padma Shri. He was posthumously awarded Padma Bhushan in 2020 for his contribution in the field of Public Affairs.

==Legacy==
Menon&#x27;s contributions are known behind the establishment of twolaw schools in India viz. National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, and the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata. He is credited with the conceptualisation of the five-year integrated LLB course, in place of the earlier three-year non-integrated course. His Socratic method of teaching, involving participation of law students in legal clinics, is considered by many as an innovation.

<doc id="1170047" wikidata="Q5129617" url="?curid=1170047" title="Clavey River">
<text>The Clavey River is a tributary of the Tuolumne River in the Sierra Nevada, located in the Stanislaus National Forest and Tuolumne County, California. The river is long, and is one of the few undammed rivers on the western slope of the Sierra. Via the Tuolumne River, the Clavey is part of the San Joaquin River watershed.

==Geography==
The headwaters of the Clavey are located in the Emigrant Wilderness of the Stanislaus National Forest, at the confluence of Bell Creek and Lily Creek about south of Pinecrest. The river flows mostly north to south, which is rare for streams in the western Sierra, which generally flow from east to west. Shortly downstream, it receives Rock Creek from the left, then Trout Creek from the right, and is crossed by Forest Route 3N01 about above the mouth. It receives Twomile and Cottonwood Creeks from the right, then Reed Creek, its largest tributary, from the left about from the mouth. Between Twomile and Cottonwood Creeks there is a concrete bridge carrying Forest Route 1N04.

The Clavey receives Bear Springs Creek and Quilty Creek from the right before reaching a final bridge that carries Forest Route 1N01. Below this point the Clavey flows through a rugged canyon inaccessible except by boat. It makes a sweeping right-hand turn to the west at Jawbone Ridge about from its confluence with the Tuolumne River. The confluence, about upstream from Lake Don Pedro, is marked by a dramatic rapid on the Tuolumne called Clavey Falls.

==Features==
Clavey Falls provides a thrilling landmark to rafters and kayakers heading downstream. The river has notable swimming holes eroded into the granitic Sierra bedrock.

The Clavey is special because it has some of the highest biotic integrity of any river in California, remaining in relatively good flora/fauna/ecological condition. This river is unique because it still harbors a pre-glacial remnant population of coastal rainbow trout.

==Conservation==
The Clavey River is one of the few undammed rivers in California, despite the many attempts to do so by the Turlock Irrigation District.

A multi-stakeholder group known as the Clavey River Ecosystem Project (CREP) is currently developing a baseline study and recommendations for the preservation of the Clavey.

<text>The Laysan rail or Laysan crake (Zapornia palmeri) was a flightless bird endemic to the Northwest Hawaiian Island of Laysan. This small island was and still is an important seabird colony, and sustained a number of endemic species, including the rail. It became extinct due to habitat loss by domestic rabbits, and ultimately World War II.

==Taxonomy==
Its scientific name honours Henry Palmer, who collected in the Hawaiian Islands for Walter Rothschild.

The following cladogram shows the placement of the Laysan rail among other rails, according to Slikas and colleagues, 2002:

==Description==

It was a small bird ( from beaktip to &quot;tail&quot; tip, fully stretched out), a flightless member of the rail family. Tail and wings had been reduced in the course of its evolution to lengths of merely and , respectively, and it only had 8 primaries as opposed to 10 in volant rails. The bill, measuring , was strong and straight, and the legs were also well-developed; in its overall proportions it was similar to the small rails of the genus &quot;Laterallus&quot;, such as the black rail.

Its coloration was essentially a lighter, more subdued version of that of the Baillon&#x27;s crake, a closely related species from which it possibly had evolved. The face, throat, breast and supercilium were dull medium gray, and the back, wings and top of the head were pale brown with strongly contrasting feather shafts except on the wings. Scapular (shoulder) and flank plumage were sandy brown. The characteristic black-and-white barring of the lower belly and undertail coverts often seen in the genera &quot;Porzana&quot; and &quot;Rallus&quot; was much reduced. Feet and bill were a yellowish-olive green, and the iris was ruby red. The sexes were alike; downy young were black all over, with conspicuously long dark legs and a yellow bill, and immature birds had the entire underside colored pale brown.

==Distribution and habitat==
It was endemic to Laysan (although an introduced population was present on Midway Atoll for some decades early in the 20th century); some authors have noted that there were tales of flightless rails on other Hawaiian islands, but they refer to local forms extinct before Western contact. A supposed early record from Lisianski Island might more likely refer to migrant rails, or alternatively to a distinct species that evolved in parallel to the Laysan rail; however, given the barrenness of Lisianski and the lack of material evidence, this is quite unlikely.

==Behavior and ecology==
The Laysan rail was an opportunist that fed mainly on invertebrates such as moths, &quot;Neoscatella sexnotata&quot; (brine flies), blowflies, and their larvae; plant leaves, seeds, and eggs and carcasses of seabirds were eaten when they were available. It was an aggressive bird that would fight off other species, particularly the Laysan finch: the latter is very adept at breaking open seabird&#x27;s eggs to consume the contents, while the rail was much less so. Consequently, rails would linger around in the seabird colony, be on the lookout for finches which had just cracked open an egg, chase these away, and consume the egg&#x27;s contents. On Midway, the rails were seen to steal food from domestic chicken. There exists no permanent source of freshwater on Laysan, and while the rails must have been able to cover their needs from the body fluids of prey and the content of eggs, they would eagerly drink from and bathe in pools of water remaining after heavy rain, or a pan of water provided by an observer.

Although it was flightless, it would use its wings to assist in keeping balance when running quickly and jumping; this way, they were able to make jumps of somewhat less than . They were nimble and restless, retreating to the tussocks to avoid predators, but chiefly to escape the mid-day heat; if they felt threatened, they often hid in the burrows of petrels. The birds were most active in the open in the morning and afternoon hours, but it could regularly be seen all day and heard calling at night. Laysan rails had no natural enemies apart from occasional predation by frigatebirds; all reports remarked upon its fearlessness, and if an observer stood still, rails would approach and even climb over him to search for scraps of food. One bird, removed from its nest in an attempt to photograph the eggs, would immediately return to protect her clutch. The species was somewhat territorial, more so during the breeding season. On Laysan, carrying capacity was reached at of habitat per bird, while on Midway, population density was one-fourth of this figure; in captivity, an enclosure of roughly was sufficient for two pairs, but introducing more birds into this space would lead to fights.

===Vocalization===
When active, Laysan rails would ever so often stand still and utter one to three soft warbling chirps. In courtship or territorial defense (reports are not clear, but probably the latter) two birds would stand opposing each other, fluffing up their plumage, and give rattling, scolding calls not unlike a mechanical alarm clock. Soon after dusk, the entire population could be heard to engage in a brief bout of vocalization, which Frohawk (1892) described as sounding like
&quot;[...]a handful or two of marbles being thrown on a glass roof and then descending in a succession of bounds.&quot;
Downy young would vocalize a lot, and their calls were rather loud in proportion to their tiny size.

===Reproduction===

On Laysan, courtship and the start of nest-building was in April, with eggs being laid from May to June and the height of the nesting season taking place in June and July; there is a report of recently hatched young birds from Midway in March, but this seems to be unusually early. On Laysan, nests were built in tussocks of endemic &quot;Cyperus pennatiformis&quot; subsp. &quot;bryanii&quot;, &quot;kāwelu&quot; (&quot;Eragrostis variabilis&quot;) and introduced Bermuda grass (&quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;) around the lagoon, while on Midway, it nested in any shelter that seemed convenient, such as &quot;naupaka kahakai&quot; (&quot;Scaevola taccada &quot;) thickets and &quot;pōhuehue&quot; (&quot;Ipomoea pes-caprae&quot; subsp. &quot;brasiliensis&quot;) stands. The nests were placed on the ground or inside the base of a tussock; in the latter case the birds would rearrange the dried dead leaves to form a roofed cavity reached through a small tunnel some long. Nests were lined with soft dried plant material and down of seabirds.

The clutch consisted of 3 or less frequently two eggs (as opposed to some 5–10 for related continental rails). These were oval without being conspicuously more rounded on one end, measuring 31 x 21 mm and being pale olive buff in base color, irregularly marked all over in pale raw sienna or purplish grey. The sexes mated either for life or for an entire breeding season and shared incubation duties, although females seem to have spent more time incubating than males.

The young hatched after approximately 20 days of incubation (perhaps somewhat less; in related species it is usually 16–20 days) and were tended for by both parents for about one month. Five days after hatching, the young were able to run as quickly as adults. Hadden (1941) described a three-day-old chick as follows:
&quot;A black velvet marble rolling along the ground. Its little feet and legs are so small and move so fast that they can hardly be seen.&quot;

==Extinction==
Laysan is considered one of the most important seabird colonies in the United States. It has thousands of black-footed albatross, Laysan albatross as well as shearwaters and terns. The island also held 5 unique species and subspecies of land- and waterbirds, including the Laysan rail. The extinction of this species is particularly unfortunate as it could have easily been avoided.

The rail was initially threatened when domestic rabbits were introduced to Laysan. With no predators to control their numbers the rabbits soon ate the entire vegetation cover on the island. This turned the island into a barren dust bowl, sending the Laysan millerbird and the Laysan honeycreeper (both endemic to the island) to extinction; the Laysan finch and Laysan duck both managed to survive. In the 1900s, when destruction of the vegetation by the rabbits had only just started, the rail&#x27;s population was around 2000 mature birds and at carrying capacity; it remained so until at least the early 1910s, but declined thereafter. In 1923, only two birds could be found on Laysan, and of eight that were on that occasion brought from Midway, at least two died almost immediately from lack of food and shelter. The species is believed to have become extinct on Laysan during 1923, probably mainly because no habitat for nesting was left in sufficient quantity to maintain the population and also due to rats being introduced to the area in 1944.
The last rail was seen on Eastern Island in Midway in June 1944.

<text>Herschel is an impact crater in Mars&#x27;s southern hemisphere. At roughly 304 kilometers in diameter, it is a moderately large impact crater. Located at 14.5°S, 130°E, Herschel is in the Mare Tyrrhenum region of Mars. The crater is jointly named after the seventeenth/eighteenth century father and son astronomers William Herschel and John Herschel.

== Moving Sand Dunes ==

Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft originally photographed fields of dark sand dunes within Herschel. Images from the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that sand dunes on the floor of the Herschel crater are not stationary (as previously believed), but moved over time. Images from photos taken by the Orbiter&#x27;s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on March 3, 2007 and December 1, 2010 show clear shifting of dunes and ripples. Research published in Icarus stated that the dunes in Hershel Crater moved 0.8 m in a time span of 3.7 Earth-years. Also, it was determined that dune ripple moved 1.1 m in that time period.

<text>The (Philosophical Dictionary) is an encyclopedic dictionary published by the Enlightenment thinker Voltaire in 1764. The alphabetically arranged articles often criticize the Roman Catholic Church, Judaism, Islam, and other institutions. The first edition, released in June 1764, went by the name of . It was 344 pages and consisted of 73 articles. Later versions were expanded into two volumes consisting of 120 articles. 

The first editions were published anonymously in Geneva by Gabriel Grasset. Due to the volatile content of the &quot;Dictionnaire&quot;, Voltaire chose Grasset over his usual publisher to ensure his own anonymity. There were many editions and reprints of the &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; during Voltaire&#x27;s lifetime, but only four of them contained additions and modifications. Furthermore, another work published in 1770, , which contained reshaped and modified articles from the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; always in alphabetical order, led many following editors to join this and the &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; (plus other minor works) in a unique opus.
The &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; was a lifelong project for Voltaire. It represents the culmination of his views on Christianity, God, morality and other subjects.

==History and origins==

The Enlightenment saw the creation of a new way of structuring information in books. The first work to employ this method was the &quot;Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot; (1697) by Pierre Bayle, in which the information is ordered alphabetically. Other important works using a similar structure followed, such as the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; by Diderot and Jean d&#x27;Alembert. Having witnessed first-hand the popularity and many advantages of this form, Voltaire used this information while preparing the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; in 1752, although it was not completed until 1764.

Having had the opportunity to write his &quot;Dictionary&quot; at a later point in time, Voltaire saw that there were certain problems with previous dictionaries, chiefly that they were all lengthy, and thus very expensive and inaccessible for much of the population. Voltaire sought to create a text which would fit in one&#x27;s pocket and be affordable because &quot;revolutionary material must be small enough for people to carry with them&quot;. What he created is a text which educated and amused at the same time.

Voltaire&#x27;s motivations for writing the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; can be seen as serendipitous. The idea was spawned at a dinner party in the court of Prince Frederick II of Prussia in 1752, during which he and other guests each agreed to write an article and share them the next morning. Voltaire consequently was the only guest to take the game seriously and the idea cascaded to form the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot;.

==Structure==
The &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; is structured in the tradition of Bayle, Diderot and d&#x27;Alembert – that is to say, alphabetically ordered. Although this order helps readers more easily find articles, this was not meant to be a dictionary or encyclopaedia in the same totalizing way of d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s project. Voltaire&#x27;s writing is neither objective nor varied in opinion; the same arguments are made throughout the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; emphasizing the point of his discontent.

==Themes==
Many of the themes addressed by Voltaire in this book are addressed or touched upon in his work &quot;L&#x27;Infame&quot;. In this and other works, Voltaire is very concerned about the injustices of the Catholic Church, which he sees as intolerant and fanatical. At the same time, his work espouses deism (though he calls it &quot;theism&quot;, contrary to its modern meaning), tolerance and freedom of the press.

==Influences==
Because this work was written late in the author&#x27;s life, coupled with the fact that it is compiled of articles written over an extended period of time, the work had many influences, which noticeably change, depending on the theme which the article addresses.

The first major influence on the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; is Voltaire&#x27;s visit to England, which gave him the opportunity to compare the problems in France with a place that had free press and to become better acquainted with important and influential thinkers such as Locke and Newton. Newtonian theory is influential in many of the articles that deal with tolerance stating that if we &quot;do not know the essence of things we will not persecute others&quot;, for those things.

The Calas affair was an event that shaped Voltaire during the creation of the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot;. Jean Calas was a Calvinist who was wrongfully convicted of killing his son. This occurred because there had been a rumour that the murder was fueled by Calas&#x27; son conversion to Catholicism. David de Beaudrige, who was in charge of the case, upon hearing this rumour, had the Calas family arrested without inquiry. Voltaire used this theme in the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; to fight against the Catholic Church.

==Reception==
The reception of the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; at the time was mixed. On one hand, the book saw a very strong reception on the part of the general public. The first edition was quickly sold out; many more editions were needed to keep up with the demand. Enlightened rulers such as Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia both have been recorded as supporters of the book.

On the other hand, the &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; was despised by religious authorities, who had a very important influence over what works were to be censored. The &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; was censored in many countries, including Switzerland (Geneva) and France. In these countries, all available copies of the book were collected and burned in the town square. Voltaire, who remained an anonymous author, was repeatedly asked if he minded that the &quot;Portatif&quot; was being burned, but he calmly replied that he had no reason to be upset.

<text>Tonya Williams (born July 12, 1958) is a Canadian actress, producer, and activist. Sometimes credited as Tonya Lee Williams, she is best known for her role as Dr. Olivia Barber Winters on the American daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from 1990 to 2005 and 2007 to 2012. She is the founder and executive director of Reelworld Film Festival.

==Early life==
Williams was born in London, England to Jamaican parents. She lived in London and Kingston, Jamaica as a young child. At age five, she contracted rheumatic fever; she and her mother then moved to Birmingham. In 1969 she and her family settled in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. As a teenager she modeled in Eaton&#x27;s catalogues and danced on a television series called &quot;Boogie!&quot; which ran on Citytv. In 1977 Williams was crowned Miss Black Ontario.

Williams was married to Robert Simpson from 1983 to 1991, but she has never remarried.

==Career==
Williams&#x27; television debut was as a host of the Canadian children&#x27;s show &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, from 1980 to 1983, after graduating from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in 1979. Appearances on the television series &quot;Check it Out!&quot; and &quot;Generations&quot; followed. Her involvement on &quot;Generations&quot; snagged her a role on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and has become her most lucrative role. Williams won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series in 2000 and 2002.

Williams appeared on &quot;A Very Brady Christmas&quot; as Cindy&#x27;s roommate.

<doc id="1170064" wikidata="Q14679560" url="?curid=1170064" title="WIAT">
<text>WIAT (channel 42) is a television station in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, affiliated with CBS and owned by Nexstar Media Group. The station&#x27;s studios are on Golden Crest Drive atop Red Mountain, where its tower is also located.

Channel 42 in Birmingham went on the air as WBMG on October 17, 1965, nearly nine years after its construction was approved. It was the city&#x27;s third commercial station after channels 6 and 13 (now WBRC and WVTM-TV), whose very high frequency (VHF) signals carried further than WBMG&#x27;s ultra high frequency (UHF) signal; the Birmingham Television Corporation, which built channel 42, had been unsuccessful in efforts to allocate a third VHF TV channel to Birmingham. The station initially aired the CBS and NBC programs not aired by channel 13 until the two stations each took full-time network affiliations in 1970. It was hemmed in by its weaker signal, the existence of CBS affiliates in Tuscaloosa and Anniston, and the dominance of the VHF stations in the ratings. Roy H. Park Broadcasting acquired WBMG in 1973, but WBMG never moved above third in the market. In response to low ratings, the station dropped local news in 1982 and restored it in 1987; the newscasts, titled &quot;Action News Birmingham&quot;, became known for a combative style and emphasis on metro-area news, but they were never highly viewed. By 1997, syndicated reruns of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; attracted more viewers than WBMG&#x27;s evening news, and a new Birmingham TV station pushed channel 42 into fourth place in news.

When Media General acquired the Park group in 1997, it planned a major overhaul of the long-struggling station. General manager Eric Land fired all of WBMG&#x27;s on-air presenters as well as other news employees in December 1997. For a month, channel 42 aired a countdown clock at 5 and 10p.m. while the news department was rebuilt from scratch, a tactic that attracted national attention. On February 5, 1998, the station changed its call letters to WIAT—for its new slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;—and relaunched its newscasts as &quot;42 Daily News&quot;. The news programs featured short stories, no on-camera reporters, and a high story count; while still in fourth place, they were a marked improvement in quality and ratings over their predecessors. After ratings plateaued in the early 2000s, the station moved to a more conventional format and brought in veteran Birmingham news personalities, which made channel 42 more competitive in the market.

Media General acquired WVTM-TV in 2006 and sold WIAT to New Vision Television to make the purchase. LIN Media acquired New Vision in 2012, and Media General acquired LIN in 2014—this time, keeping WIAT and selling WVTM. Nexstar purchased Media General in 2017.

==Pre-launch==
In March 1956, the Birmingham Television Corporation—formed by Harry and Elmer Balaban—was incorporated in Alabama and proceeded to file for Birmingham&#x27;s unused ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 42. That same month, Birmingham radio station WSGN filed for channel 42 as well. It was the second application for television made by WSGN, which had previously sought channel 48 and was an ABC affiliate in radio. The fact that two applicants were seeking a UHF channel was of note given that UHF television had proved mostly an economic failure due to lack of transmitter power and the inability of many sets to tune UHF stations.

WSGN&#x27;s owners, the Winston-Salem Broadcasting Company, withdrew their application for channel 42 on November 28, 1956. The withdrawal was part of a consolidation with the Balaban application, which was approved. Of the prospects for a new station, which would likely have been an ABC affiliate at that point in time, Roger Thames of &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; wrote,

The Birmingham Television Corporation spent years trying to move a third commercial channel in the more established very high frequency (VHF) band to Birmingham. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the FCC considered adding such a channel to Birmingham on multiple occasions. In 1959, it considered moving channel 8 into Birmingham; WBMG favored a proposal to relocate channel 4 from Columbus, Mississippi, which was also denied. In 1963, it opted to deny the addition of channel 3. The pending proceedings spared the unbuilt station, with the call sign WBMG, from deletion. In 1960, the FCC sent letters to the permittees of 54 unused or unbuilt UHF stations, including WBMG, ordering them to resume or lose the permit. WBMG and a permit in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were spared due to the pending proposals. In 1963, Winston-Salem Broadcasting became the sole owner of the Birmingham Television Corporation when it bought out the Balabans&#x27; stake.

==Construction and early years==
In November 1964, Winston-Salem Broadcasting filed to sell a two-thirds stake to four investors: William P. Dubois, Enterprise Funds Inc., Northwest Growth Fund Inc., and Exchange Capitol Corporation. The FCC approved this transaction in March 1965. With the new ownership, plans were set in motion to construct WBMG, with Dubois as general manager. Even at this juncture, the station attempted to improve its position by filing for the lower channel 21. 

WBMG began broadcasting on October 17, 1965. The quarters it occupied on Red Mountain had belonged to radio station WJLD and were designed to accommodate a television operation. WBMG did not hold a primary network affiliation at launch. WAPI-TV (channel 13) held the primary affiliations with CBS and NBC in central Alabama, and not all of their programming was seen in Birmingham as a result; channel 42 filled this gap by airing the network shows not aired on channel 13. This was illustrated in its first day of programming: the inaugural program was an NBC News special, but later in the evening the station aired &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; from CBS. Likewise, WBMG aired the &quot;CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on weeknights. Carson had gone unseen in Birmingham in several years. Because WAPI-TV had first-call rights on the networks&#x27; programs, series moved between the stations, sometimes in the middle of the television season.

The station broadcast with an effective radiated power of 479,000 watts until 1969, when it activated a new, tower and increased its power to over a million watts. The new tower was boasted to increase the station&#x27;s signal in areas from Anniston and Gadsden in the east to Tuscaloosa in the west. By this time, Tuscaloosa and Anniston each had their own stations: Tuscaloosa&#x27;s WCFT (channel 33) debuted in October 1965, while Anniston&#x27;s WHMA-TV (channel 40) started in October 1969. This situation persisted until May 31, 1970, when WAPI-TV became the sole NBC affiliate under a new agreement with NBC and WBMG the sole CBS affiliate. Likewise, WCFT and WHMA-TV became full-time CBS affiliates.

In 1971, WBMG moved into larger studios on Red Mountain.

==Park Broadcasting ownership==
Park Broadcasting, the radio and television enterprise of Roy H. Park, acquired WBMG in 1973, bringing its station group up to the then-limit of seven outlets. Park continued to make capital investments in channel 42 in spite of its reduced coverage area, including new video tape equipment, electronic news gathering, and a new antenna. However, these changes did not fully help WBMG, whose signal could not fully penetrate the hilly Central Alabama terrain.

The station produced a number of local programs; these included a public affairs series (&quot;Spectrum&quot;), live studio wrestling, a weekly church service, and annual coverage of Birmingham&#x27;s Veterans Day parade. In the late 1960s and 1970s, channel 42 offered &quot;Sgt. Jack&quot;, a children&#x27;s show hosted by Birmingham disc jockey Neal Miller. Its studios were the home to the first programs produced by Mother Angelica, founder of the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN); she severed her relationship with WBMG in 1981 when it aired a CBS miniseries based on the 1972 novel &quot;The Word&quot;, which she believed presented Jesus as a fake.

While WBMG debuted a local newscast when it signed on in 1965, its news efforts were generally minimal. One of its first employees was Bill Bolen, who had worked at WSGN radio and later left to spend 41 years at WBRC; he recalled channel 42 as &quot;primitive&quot;. By 1977, the news staff numbered four people, while WBRC and WAPI-TV each had 20 or more employees in their news departments. Few people watched. In 1981, WBMG&#x27;s 6p.m. newscast attracted six percent of the audience at that hour to 49 percent for WBRC and 33 percent for the recently renamed WVTM-TV, and the station had no newscast at 10p.m. General manager Hoyle Broome touted the straightforward format of his newscast as an alternative. The newscast, known as &quot;Metro News&quot;, was then moved to 5p.m. in hopes of attracting an audience as the first newscast of the evening; WVTM dashed those hopes by debuting a 5p.m. newscast of its own, prompting station officials to reevaluate. In March 1982, the newscast was replaced with short news updates during daytime and evening programming, and the news staff was reduced from five employees to two. The station did not air local newscasts for the next several years; Park instead invested in a new, taller tower and higher-power transmitter facility for WBMG, which were activated in 1983 and 1984, respectively.

===&quot;Action News Birmingham&quot;===
In late 1986, WBMG began readying a return to local news production, prompting Tuscaloosa-based WDBB to cancel its low-rated 9p.m. local newscast. Park invested $1.5 million to start &quot;WBMG Action News Birmingham&quot;, which debuted on January 12, 1987. The news department, with weeknight 5 and 10p.m. newscasts as well as weekend editions, focused on news in the five-county Birmingham metro area, rather than the much larger news coverage areas of WBRC and WVTM; the goal was not to be number one but merely to occupy a niche. News director Frank Morock believed the expanding focuses of the other stations left Birmingham and its environs relatively underserved. News viewership for &quot;Action News Birmingham&quot; hovered between five and nine percent of the audience, a far cry from the shares of 30 percent or above commanded by each of WBRC and WVTM. The newscasts were losing in the ratings to syndicated reruns on Birmingham&#x27;s independent station, WTTO, though station management contended and a coincidental telephone survey found that viewership was higher than reflected in ratings diaries.

John Herrod left KTXS-TV in Sweetwater, Texas, to become WBMG&#x27;s news director in 1990. He sought to give the station a defined news image by airing longer, more in-depth stories. Channel 42 also became known for aggressive reporting. When WBRC anchor Janet Hall became a spokeswoman for the Birmingham Zoo, WBMG produced a news special openly asking whether WBRC could be considered a reliable source for reporting on the troubled facility. Doors being slammed in WBMG reporters&#x27; faces became a common sight on channel 42&#x27;s newscasts, and the station did a series of reports on why Birmingham city officials were not talking to WBMG. Even though WBMG&#x27;s news audience consisted of one to two percent of the market, a study by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that WBMG&#x27;s &quot;Action News&quot; aired more local news stories and longer stories than its higher-rated competitors in one week in April 1994, concluding, &quot;Channel 42 was guilty of some editorializing but clearly offered more substance than the other two stations.&quot;

===Shifting affiliations elsewhere, shifting ownership at Park===
In 1994, Park Communications sold itself to Donald R. Tomlin and Gary B. Knapp in a deal backed by the Retirement Systems of Alabama pension fund. The sale of Park led to the end of Herrod&#x27;s &quot;Action News&quot; format and combative approach in favor of a more mainstream news presentation with the same amount of crime news as other local stations. A new news director was hired in late 1995; the station initiated new weekend, morning, and 5p.m. newscasts in 1996; and the newsroom was expanded from to .

Meanwhile, a major realignment of television station affiliations and ownership was brewing in the market. In May 1994, New World Communications agreed to affiliate 12 stations with Fox, including ABC affiliate WBRC-TV, which it had just agreed to buy from Citicasters. At the same time, New World agreed to buy Argyle Television, owner of NBC affiliate WVTM-TV; to resolve the conflict, WBRC-TV was sold directly to the Fox network. This deal set off a slow-motion affiliation shuffle in Birmingham as ABC sought a replacement affiliate. ABC negotiated with WBMG and was even reported to be near a deal. Instead, Park Communications signed a long-term renewal with CBS, owing to its upcoming deal to carry Southeastern Conference college sports and the company&#x27;s lengthy relationship with the network.

As a replacement, ABC persuaded the CBS affiliates in Tuscaloosa and Anniston, WCFT and WJSU, to switch affiliations. They would act as full-power satellites of a low-power station in Birmingham, WBMA-LP, with a new combined news operation in Birmingham. The new station, which debuted in September 1996 under the moniker &quot;ABC 33/40&quot;, featured veteran Alabama news personalities including WBRC&#x27;s James Spann and Brenda Ladun, later poaching anchor Pam Huff from WVTM. The newscasts on WBMA immediately rose to third place in the Birmingham ratings, pushing channel 42 to fourth place. Nielsen Media Research, which measures television ratings, proceeded to announce that it would fold Tuscaloosa and Anniston into the Birmingham Designated Market Area as a result of their local stations being merged with WBMA; in addition, it would introduce meters instead of diaries to the enlarged market.

==&quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;: Media General acquisition and relaunch as WIAT==
===New ownership and management===
Media General, a broadcaster and publisher based in Richmond, Virginia, announced it would purchase Park Communications in July 1996, creating a company focused on media holdings in the Southeast. The company assumed ownership of WBMG in January 1997 and fired 17-year general manager Hoyle Broome in March. His replacement was Eric Land, who arrived from WGRZ in Buffalo, New York. Among Land&#x27;s first moves was simulcasting WBMG&#x27;s newscasts on WNAL in Gadsden, which had replaced WJSU as the CBS affiliate in the eastern portion of the state. The station also ended its longtime relationship with UAB athletics; Broome, a noted booster, was known for preempting CBS prime time programming for sports.

Land&#x27;s priority was to fix the news department; he had previously overseen major overhauls at WGRZ and at WEYI-TV in Saginaw, Michigan. The station&#x27;s newscasts had sunk below &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; on WTTO and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; on WABM in the ratings, and they were so poor that not even the anchors&#x27; parents watched, Land later recalled. Speculation of a major shakeup was fed by a major research project as well as the resignations of several senior managers over the course of 1997.

On December 11, 1997, WBMG fired all of its on-air anchors and reporters as well as other news staffers, a total of 21 people, effective December 31. Land declared, &quot;We just cannot continue to offer a traditional newscast. That&#x27;s already being done in this market.&quot; The station&#x27;s employees had expected Land to make significant changes. While lead weeknight anchorman Chris Schauble told the &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot; that he had known as early as Thanksgiving that he was going to be fired, many other staffers did not know exactly what would take place until the firings were announced. A day before the final newscast, on December 31, Land announced that it would be replaced with a clock counting down to the debut of a new newscast on February 5, coinciding with the start of the 1998 Winter Olympics, which aired on CBS; he joked, &quot;More people will probably watch the clock than watched the news broadcast anyway.&quot; The story attracted attention well beyond Birmingham; Mark Lorando in the New Orleans &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; compared Land&#x27;s mass firing to the series finale of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, in which nearly every news staffer was fired. During this time, the news department was reconstructed with input from focus groups and market research. The newsroom also kept functioning; the station sent coverage of the January 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women Clinic in Birmingham&#x27;s Southside neighborhood by Eric Rudolph to CBS Newspath, CNN, and stations in neighboring markets, even though it was not airing a newscast.

===Launch of &quot;42 Daily News&quot;===
On that date, at 5p.m., viewers saw Land push a plunger to blow up the WBMG logo before an audience of Birmingham community leaders. The station changed its call sign to WIAT, for It&#x27;s About Time, the slogan of the station&#x27;s new &quot;42 Daily News&quot; newscasts, which aired at 5 and 10p.m. The &quot;Daily News&quot; format eschewed on-camera reporters; stories were packaged into topical minute segments such as &quot;Alabama Minute&quot; and &quot;Education Minute&quot;. The format earned comparisons to CNN Headline News from Keith Cate, who came from WMAR-TV in Baltimore to serve as lead co-anchor, and an article in the &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot;. One anchor manned the news desk, while the other read stories from various places on the new set. The &quot;2-Minute Drill&quot; sportscast was provided by Paul Finebaum, a &quot;Post-Herald&quot; columnist and radio show host on WERC; the sportscast in the 5p.m. newscast aired live on TV and radio. The other weeknight news presenters, like Cate, came from out of the market: Sherri Jackson was hired from WSAZ-TV in Huntington, West Virginia, while Declan Cannon had worked at The Weather Channel. Al Primo, who created the Eyewitness News format at KYW-TV in Philadelphia in 1965, delivered sharp criticism of what he felt was &quot;a product that was generated solely by research and implemented by people who don&#x27;t know anything about the news business&quot; and &quot;the most disjointed presentation [of a newscast] that I have ever seen in my life&quot;. Land responded to Primo&#x27;s scathing remarks by comparing the format to the &quot;Al Schottelkotte News&quot;, a longtime staple of WCPO-TV in Cincinnati from the 1960s until 1990, for which he had been a reporter: &quot;[The Al Schottelkotte News] was very nontraditional, but jam-packed with information.&quot;

&quot;42 Daily News&quot; represented an immediate ratings improvement over its predecessor; the 10 p.m. newscast, in particular, had increased from a paltry 3% share in February 1997 to a 7% share in February 1998, partly due to having the Winter Olympics as a lead-in. This was not enough to overtake any competitors, but it was higher than the last newscasts as WBMG. Ratings also increased once Birmingham became a metered market, moving to 3 and 4 shares on most nights early in the fall of 1998, and continued their steady climb in early 1999.

Some of the firings resulted in legal action against channel 42. Seven Black former employees sued the station for racial discrimination in 1999, alleging they had been fired for their race and that White employees had been treated better; Media General prevailed in multiple state and federal cases. Doug Bell, the station&#x27;s sports director since 1988, and former general manager Broome each sued Media General for breach of contract.

The WIAT relaunch did not include a morning newscast, which WBMG had debuted prior to 1997. The station did not begin airing a local morning show until 2000, when it began simulcasting an hour of the morning show hosted by Russ and Dee Fine on WYDE radio. The station added a 6p.m. evening newscast the next year. Land departed in 2001 when Media General tapped him to run WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida, the company&#x27;s flagship television property; he reunited with Cate, who had joined the WFLA news staff the year before. Finebaum left in May 2002 after a run of more than four years with channel 42; WIAT began broadcasting a digital signal, including high-definition programming, on November 20 of that year.

Ratings growth leveled off after several years of the &quot;42 Daily News&quot; format, and viewing figures remained flat between 2000 and 2003. While the reporter-less format cost the station less—the WIAT news department had 25 employees in 2003, compared to 70 at WBRC—it was not prospering against more traditional news competition and with a lack of recognizable faces.

Beginning in 2005, WIAT produced a 9p.m. newscast for WTTO, at that time the market&#x27;s affiliate of The WB. The new WIAT production replaced WTTO&#x27;s News Central hybrid newscast and required the expansion of channel 42&#x27;s news staff.

==Since 2006==
===Sale to New Vision Television===
In 2006, Media General announced it would acquire a package of four smaller-market NBC affiliates owned by the NBC network, which included WVTM. Media General opted to keep WVTM because its signal reached more households; it also was third in the market in revenue compared to WIAT in fourth. The company put four of its stations up for the sale, including WIAT, to finance the purchase and meet ownership limits in the Birmingham market. WIAT and KIMT in Mason City, Iowa, were sold to Atlanta-based New Vision Television in a deal announced in August and completed in October 2006.

After the sale, WIAT cemented itself as the number-three station in ratings. It debuted a full-fledged morning newscast in September 2007, and it began attracting noted news personalities under general manager Bill Ballard, who ran the station from 2003 to 2013. Herb Winches, a veteran Birmingham sportscaster for WBRC and WVTM, worked at channel 42 from 2007 to 2008 before being replaced by Jim Dunaway, a 15-year veteran of WVTM and sports talk radio host. The station also hired other longtime news presenters in Birmingham, including Ken Lass, Mark Prater, and David Neal.

WIAT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 42, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 30, using virtual channel 42.

===LIN, Media General, and Nexstar ownership===
On May 7, 2012, LIN Media announced that it would purchase the New Vision Television stations, including WIAT, for $330.4 million and the assumption of $12 million in New Vision corporate debt. LIN was acquired two years later by Media General, which opted to keep WIAT and divest WVTM, along with WJCL in Savannah, Georgia, to Hearst Television. After purchasing LIN, Media General initially agreed to merge with the Meredith Corporation but faced a shareholder revolt in the wake of an unsolicited offer from Nexstar Broadcasting Group, which agreed to acquire the company in 2016.

Several of the veteran personalities hired under Ballard departed in the late 2010s. Prater abruptly left WIAT in April 2018, later pleading guilty to harassing a woman he had dated. Dunaway moved to the news desk in 2015, co-anchoring the evening newscasts with Jackson, before leaving in 2018. He was replaced by Art Franklin, who had been the first Black man to anchor an evening newscast in Birmingham at WBRC in the 1990s and was previously seen on channel 42&#x27;s morning newscasts; Franklin departed in 2022.

==Notable former on-air staff==
* Catherine Callaway – anchor, 1989–1993 (known as Catherine Gee at WBMG)
* Dale Cardwell – investigative reporter
* Alex Chappell – sports reporter
* Hank Erwin – anchor, early 1980s

<doc id="1170065" wikidata="Q2975393" url="?curid=1170065" title="Underdog">
<text>An underdog is a person or group in a competition, usually in sports and creative works, who is largely expected to lose. The party, team, or individual expected to win is called the favorite or . In the case where an underdog wins, the outcome is an upset. An &quot;underdog bet&quot; is a bet on the underdog or outsider for which the odds are generally higher.

The first recorded uses of the term occurred in the second half of the 19th century; its first meaning was &quot;the beaten dog in a fight&quot;.

In British and American culture, underdogs are highly regarded. This harkens back to core Judeo-Christian stories, such as that of David and Goliath, and also ancient British legends such as Robin Hood and King Arthur. This is also reflected in the idea of the American dream, where someone from a low social class can achieve success through hard work. Sports are another instance where underdogs are highly valorized, reflected in both real events, such as the Miracle on Ice, and in popular culture depictions of sports. Spectators and commentators are commonly drawn to establishing one side as the underdog, even if both teams are considered evenly matched.

In fiction, the Fool archetype is often an underdog if they are depicted as the main character. Their apparent ineptitude leads to people underestimating their true abilities, and they are able to succeed against a more powerful, &quot;establishment&quot; villain. An example in film is The Tramp portrayed by Charlie Chaplin.

== Social norms ==
People often root for underdogs for various psychological and cultural reasons; for example, witnessing and experiencing underdog challenges can lead one to empathise with the effort required to overcome such obstacles, fostering a connection with others who confront similar hardships. This shared understanding may, in turn, contribute to breaking social norms by challenging prevailing expectations and disrupting established power dynamics. Social norms often dictate that success is reserved for those in privileged or dominant positions; however, the underdog narrative challenges this norm by portraying individuals or groups who are perceived as disadvantaged, less powerful, or less likely to succeed. One could argue that individuals or groups perceived as underdogs may face a different set of expectations and allowances within a social context. The underdog is often seen as disadvantaged or less likely to conform to established norms. In this context, society might be more lenient or accept norm violations from underdogs, as their perceived struggles or challenges may evoke empathy or understanding.   

== Social justice ==
We also rally round the underdog to satisfy our need for social justice. Supporting the underdog gives us a sense of agency and empowerment as we align ourselves with those fighting against the odds. It reinforces the belief that individuals can overcome adversity and effect positive change, promoting a sense of hope and optimism for social justice efforts. Humans naturally support social justice, as seen in a study publicised by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. This study examined how individuals and groups manage shared resources. The results revealed differences in resource allocation and outcomes based on group size. These findings shed light on our innate preference to fairness and equality, as how individuals and groups allocate and utilise these resources reflects principles of fairness and equality. 

== Underdog and schadenfreude ==
Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider argues that the concept of schadenfreude plays an essential role in the sympathy gained by the underdog particularly when the dominant party is perceived as undeserving of their success. This phenomenon has received attention from social scientists who argue that resentment towards high-status individuals can fuel Schadenfreude when they experience a downfall.  Heider suggests there is tendency to root against the &quot;top dog,&quot; or those perceived as riding high, indicating a pleasure from watching them fail, thus we support the underdog. The interconnection between rooting for the underdog and Schadenfreude is illustrated in a study by Stephen Ceci and Edward Kain (1982) in the context of political elections. Their findings suggest that exposure to polls depicting a candidate as having a dominant position did not evoke positive feelings towards the underdog but instead created a negative reaction towards the dominant candidate. This negative reaction could be indicative of a form of schadenfreude, where individuals derive satisfaction from seeing the dominant figure falter. When participants were shown the leading contender in the polls, they tended to move away from supporting them, possibly due to a subconscious pleasure in witnessing their potential downfall. However, when presented with information indicating a shift in the polls towards the underdog, participants shifted their support back to the leading contender. This shift in support suggests that the pleasure derived from the underdog&#x27;s potential victory may not necessarily stem from genuine support for the underdog but rather from the satisfaction of seeing the leading candidate lose their position of power. This highlights how opposition reactivity, possibly driven by schadenfreude towards the leading candidate, influences shifts in support towards the underdog during electoral contests. 

Both underdog support and Schadenfreude are influenced by perceptions of deserving and fairness within competitive contexts. The interplay between these two phenomena sheds light on the complex motivations underlying individuals&#x27; reactions to competitive situations, where notions of justice, fairness, and deserving play crucial roles in shaping emotional responses.

== Limitations of the underdog ==
Studies supporting the underdog effect often face challenges in accurately assessing its implications. Despite efforts to create realistic scenarios, limitations persist in capturing the emotional nuances and social dynamics present in real-life situations where underdog support is observed. For instance, Stephen Ceci and Edwards Kain&#x27;s (1982) study may be susceptible to demand characteristics or social desirability bias, potentially influencing participants&#x27; responses. Such biases could affect the authenticity of participants&#x27; expressions of support or disdain for candidates depicted in polls, especially in sensitive contexts like political elections. 

Moreover, reliance on self-report measures in the study may oversimplify participants&#x27; emotional reactions, particularly concerning complex psychological phenomena like schadenfreude. Additionally, the study&#x27;s exclusive focus on electoral contexts may limit the generalizability of its findings to other domains, such as sports or business competitions, where underdog phenomena and schadenfreude may manifest differently. Future research could mitigate these limitations by employing diverse methodological approaches and exploring underdog and schadenfreude dynamics across various contexts to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these phenomena. 

Furthermore, there are challenges in distinguishing underdog support from schadenfreude, underscoring the intricate relationship between these psychological constructs. While the assumption is that both forces operate in the same direction, they may represent interchangeable phenomena rather than distinct processes. Attempts to disentangle them may have inadvertently created a byproduct, complicating rather than clarifying their distinction. This suggests that the emotions associated with supporting underdogs and experiencing schadenfreude may be more intertwined than previously recognized, posing difficulties for researchers seeking to isolate and comprehend each theory independently. Further investigation into the complex interplay between underdog support and schadenfreude is necessary to unravel their intricate dynamics fully. 

Additionally, underdog narratives can sometimes reinforce stigmatization, highlighting the need to address paternalistic tendencies that may portray underdogs as objects of sympathy rather than active agents. Such portrayals risk overlooking the agency and dignity of individuals marginalised by society, perpetuating symbolic tokenism rather than genuine empowerment.

==Cinderella==

In sports, the terms Cinderella, &quot;Cinderella story&quot;, and Cinderella team are used to refer to situations in which competitors achieve far greater success than would reasonably have been best expected. Cinderella stories tend to gain much media and fan attention as they move closer to the tournament final game.

The term comes from the well-known European folk tale of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which embodies a myth-element of unjust oppression and triumphant reward, when the title character&#x27;s life of poverty is suddenly changed to one of remarkable fortune. In a sporting context the term has been used at least since 1939, but came into widespread usage in 1950, when the Disney movie was released that year, and in reference to City College of New York, the unexpected winners of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball championship also that year. The term was used by Bill Murray in the 1980 movie &quot;Caddyshack&quot; where he pretends as the announcer to his own golf fantasy: &quot;Cinderella story. Outta nowhere. A former greenskeeper, now, about to become the Masters champion.&quot; Referring somewhat inaccurately to the plot details of the classic &quot;Cinderella&quot; story, the media will debate whether the given &quot;Cinderella&quot; team or player will &quot;turn into a pumpkin&quot;, i.e. fail to win the prize and then return to its former obscurity. In the fairy tale, it was the carriage that turned into a pumpkin at midnight, not Cinderella herself. Another popular term is &quot;strike midnight&quot;, when a Cinderella team does finally get beaten.

Prior to the widespread use of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in this way, the more common term for unexpected and dramatic success was &quot;Miracle&quot;, as in the &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; of 1914, the &quot;Miracle on Grass&quot; in 1950, the &quot;Miracle of Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; in 1951, the &quot;Miracle Mets&quot; of 1969, and the &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; in 1980.

Cinderella teams are also referred to as a surprise package or surprise packet, and their success would be termed a fairy-tale run. A related concept is the giant-killer, which refers to a lesser competitor who defeats a favorite, reflecting the story of David and Goliath. In Soviet sport, particularly team sports like football and hockey, there appeared a term Thunder to the Dominant [teams] (, Groza avtoritetov) that referred to underdog, often a strong mid-table team, of which the dominant teams were afraid. The title is still in use in the post-Soviet period and sometimes is given to &quot;dark horse&quot; teams which manage to win a major tournament. There was an official sports award that was introduced by the Soviet sports weekly &quot;Sportivnaya Moskva&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s for football and hockey top competitions awarded to teams that managed to take away the biggest number of points from the last season top-three placed teams.

<doc id="1170068" wikidata="Q7143575" url="?curid=1170068" title="Pat Hoy">
<text>Pat Hoy (born September 21, 1950) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2011 representing the riding of Chatham-Kent—Essex.

==Background==
Hoy was born in 1950 in Chatham-Kent, Ontario to John Hoy and Dolores de Witte. Hoy was a farmer in the Merlin area. He served as President of the Kent Federation of Agriculture from 1984 to 1985, and was a member of the Crop Insurance Commission of Ontario from 1987 to 1995 (serving as its Vice-Chair in 1992 and 1993). He is also a founder of the Kent County Agricultural Hall of Fame, and has been a director of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. In 1972, he married Debbie Murphy. Hoy is known to hold some socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion.

==Politics==
Hoy was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election for the riding of Essex—Kent, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate George Kennedy and New Democrat incumbent Pat Hayes by a plurality of about 2,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Hoy served as his party&#x27;s agriculture critic for the next four years. He endorsed Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Liberal Party in 1996.

Because of redistribution, Hoy was forced to face another incumbent, Progressive Conservative Jack Carroll, in new riding of Chatham-Kent—Essex in the 1999 provincial election. Hoy scored a convincing victory, winning by 8,001 votes. The Tories again won the election, and Hoy continued to serve as his party&#x27;s agriculture critic until 2000, when he was transferred to transportation.

Hoy was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, which the Liberals won. He became Chair of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs in December of that year. He retained the chair position until 2011.

Hoy was elected for a fourth term in the provincial election of 2007. In March 2011, Hoy announced that he was retiring from the legislature and would not run in 2011.

<text>Nicaraguans (; also called &quot;Nicas&quot;) are people inhabiting in, originating or having significant heritage from Nicaragua. Most Nicaraguans live in Nicaragua, although there is also a significant Nicaraguan diaspora, particularly in Costa Rica and the United States with smaller communities in other countries around the world. There are also people living in Nicaragua who are not Nicaraguans because they were not born or raised in Nicaragua nor have they gained citizenship.

==Genetic makeup==
The genetic makeup of Nicaraguans differs from the western half of Nicaragua to the eastern half. DNA studies show that most western Nicaraguans (whites and mestizos) descend from Europeans (mostly Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese) and an Indigenous combination of Nahua, Otomanguean, and Chibcha ancestry. The combined Nahua, Otomanguean, and Chibcha ancestry of western Nicaraguans suggests that instead of a mass displacement of Chibchas by migrating Mesoamerican groups like the Nicaraos and Chorotegas, they assimilated the Chibchas who already inhabited western Nicaragua into their societies and mixed with them, blending North American and South American ancestries. This is further evident in the Chibcha minorities that lived and thrived within the Nahua chiefdoms of Kwawkapolkan, Kakawatan, and Masatepek in modern-day Rivas and Masaya. In addition, the military forces of Kwawkapolkan, Kakawatan, and Masatepek had Chibcha troops serving alongside their Nahua counterparts as military service provided social advancement and assimilation to further integrate into Nahua society. Furthermore, the Nicaraos cultivation of potatoes also suggests cultural diffusion between the Nahuas and Chibchas, as the Chibchas introduced potatoes to Nicaragua from South America which did not reach northern Mesoamerica. 

Genetic studies show that eastern Nicaraguans mostly descend from shipwrecked African slaves who intermarried and mixed with the Indigenous peoples of Caribbean Nicaragua (creating the Miskito Sambu, an ethnic group of Zambos), and British colonizers who ruled the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras for roughly 225 years. The black Nicaraguans in the Caribbean coast are mostly of West Indian (Antillean) origin, the descendants of slaves brought mostly from Jamaica when the region was a British protectorate. There is also a smaller number of Garifuna, a people of mixed Carib, Angolan, Congolese and Arawak descent. However, pure Indigenous peoples still exist in the Caribbean coast, such as the Rama, Mayangna, and the Tawira Miskito who&#x27;re related to the Zambo Miskitos, both groups were rivals and often competed for territory which led to wars between the two, further dividing the two Miskito groups in the 18th century.

==Demographics==
===Population===

As of 2023, Nicaragua&#x27;s total human population reached 7.0 million, with the capital (and most populous) city of Managua containing 1.5 million.

According to the UN, Nicaragua has a population of 7,243,000 (July 1, 2015) with a population growth rate of 1.31% (during the period 2005–2010) and a birth rate of 24.9 / 1,000 population (2005–2010), third highest in the region. The life expectancy for Nicaraguans at birth is (2005–2015) 74.45 years; 70.9 for males and 78.0 for females.

===Ethnic groups===

Data from the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot; estimates that Nicaragua&#x27;s population is around 69% Mestizos, and 17% White, with the majority being of full Spanish descent as well as Italian, German, or French ancestry. Mestizos and White make up the majority of Nicaraguans and mainly reside in the western region of the country, combined they make up 88% and of the total population.

About 5% of Nicaraguans are descending from one or more of the country&#x27;s indigenous peoples. Nicaragua&#x27;s pre-Columbian population consisted of many indigenous groups such as the Nahua. In the western region, the Nahua people (also known as the Pipil-Nicaraos) were present along with other groups such as Otomangueans and Chibchas. Nicaragua&#x27;s central region and the Caribbean coast were inhabited by indigenous peoples who were also Chibcha-related groups that had migrated from South America, primarily what is today Colombia and Venezuela. These groups include the present-day Miskitos, Ramas and Mayangna. In the 19th century, there was a substantial indigenous minority, but this group was also largely assimilated culturally into the mestizo majority. In the mid-1980s, the government divided the department of Zelaya Department into two autonomous regions and granted the Indigenous people of this region limited self-rule.

The remainder 9% of Nicaragua&#x27;s population is black, and mainly reside on the country&#x27;s sparsely populated Caribbean (or Atlantic) coast. The black population is mostly of West Indian (Antillean) origin, the descendants of indentured laborers brought mostly from Jamaica when the region was a British protectorate. There is also a smaller number of Garifuna, a people of mixed Carib, Angolan, Congolese and Arawak descent.

===Immigration===

Relative to its overall population, Nicaragua has never experienced any large scale wave of immigrants. The total number of immigrants to Nicaragua, both originating from other Latin American countries and all other countries, never surpassed 1% of its total population prior to 1995. The 2005 census showed the foreign-born population at 1.2%, having risen a mere .06% in 10 years. This is not to say that immigrants were not important to the evolution of Nicaraguan society and the Nicaraguan nation.

In the 19th century Nicaragua experienced a wave of immigration, primarily from Europe. In particular, families from Spain, Germany, Italy, France and Belgium generally moved to Nicaragua to start a new life. They received free land, monetary incentives, and other perks in exchange for populating unsettled territories and working in the new growing coffee industry. In time immigrants were able to set up newspapers, hotels and banks.

There is also a small Middle Eastern-Nicaraguan community of Syrian, Armenian, Palestinian Nicaraguan, Jewish Nicaraguan, and Lebanese people in Nicaragua with a total population of about 30,000. There is also an East Asian community of Chinese. The Chinese Nicaraguan population is estimated at 12,000. The Chinese arrived in the late 19th century but were unsubstantiated until the second census (in 1920) revealed 400 people of the Chinese nationality.

==Nicaraguans abroad==
Nicaragua, as well as other Latin American countries, have a long history of migration to the United States. However, Nicaragua is the only country in its region to have Costa Rica as the primary destination. Estimates on the basis of the Nicaraguan Health Survey indicated that at least 11% of Nicaraguan households have at least 1 person residing abroad.

Smaller numbers of Nicaraguans live in many other countries around the world such as other countries in Latin America, Europe, Canada, China and Taiwan among others.

===Nicaraguans in Costa Rica===
Nicaraguan migration to Costa Rica has occurred since the mid-19th century. Unlike other Latin American countries, Nicaraguan migrants&#x27; primary destination is not the United States, it is Costa Rica. An estimate 9% (more than 385,899) of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans; some of them migrate for seasonal work opportunities and then return to their country. Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed an agreement regulating seasonal migration in 1998; it allows Nicaraguans with work permits to enter Costa Rica at the western border at Peñas Blancas on the Pan-American Highway. In the northern part of Costa Rica there are 287,766 Nicaraguans and the Catholic Church in this area has an active program to protect the rights of migrant workers.

===Nicaraguans in the United States===
Abroad, the United States is home to the second largest number of Nicaraguans outside Nicaragua, particularly in the Miami area. The estimated number of Nicaraguan Americans in the United States was 281,167 in 2006, up from 177,684 in 2000.

The earliest documents of immigration from Nicaragua to the United States was combined in total with those of other Central American countries. However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau some 7,500 Nicaraguans legally immigrated from 1967 to 1976. An estimated 28,620 Nicaraguans were living in the U.S. in 1970, 90% of which self-reported as &quot;white&quot; on the 1970 census. Most Nicaraguan immigrants during the late 1960s were women: there were only 60 male Nicaraguan immigrants for every 100 female immigrants during this period. In 1998 more than two million Nicaraguans were left homeless due to hurricane Mitch, as a result many Nicaraguans received permanent residence or temporary protected status (TPS) in the late 1990s.

According to the 1990 U.S. Census 168,659 of the total 202,658 documented Nicaraguans in the U.S. were born in Nicaragua. In 1992 approximately 10–12% of the Nicaraguan population had emigrated. These emigrants tended to be disproportionately of working age, better educated, and more often white-collar workers than nonmigrants. In addition, emigrants were more likely to come from larger premigration households and higher income households.

;Areas of greatest concentration in the United States
The largest concentration of Nicaraguan Americans in the United States, about 79,559, is in Miami, Florida, most notably around the areas of Sweetwater and &quot;Little Managua&quot;. Sweetwater has the highest concentration of Nicaraguan American in the United States, in 2000 16.63% of Sweetwater residents identified as being of Nicaraguan heritage. This was the highest percentage of Nicaraguan Americans of any place in the country. As a result, Sweetwater is locally known as &quot;Little Managua&quot; after Managua, the Nicaraguan capital. However, the area of &quot;Little Havana&quot; in Miami is also colloquially called &quot;Little Managua&quot; even though Sweetwater has a higher number of Nicaraguan Americans.

California hosts the second largest concentration, most notably in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco. The number of Nicaraguan Americans living in California was 51,336 in 2000.

==History==

It is known that Nicaragua was inhabited by Paleo-Indians as far back as 6000 years. This is confirmed by archaeological evidences, mainly ceramics and statues made of volcanic stone like the ones found on the island of Zapatera and petroglyphs found on Ometepe island. At the end of the 15th century, western Nicaragua was inhabited by several different indigenous peoples related by culture to the Mesoamerican civilizations of the Aztec and Maya, and by language to the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. However, within three decades an estimated Indian population of one million plummeted to a few tens of thousands, as approximately half of the indigenous people in western Nicaragua died of diseases brought by the Spaniards. The central region and the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua were inhabited by indigenous peoples who were mostly Chibcha-related groups that had migrated from South America, primarily what is now Colombia and Venezuela. These groups include the present-day Miskitos, Ramas and Sumos who lived a less sedentary life based on hunting and gathering, as well as fishing and performing slash-and-burn agriculture.

During the 1979 uprising, many middle-class and wealthy families left Nicaragua. The Sandinista revolution during the 1980s brought a wave of Nicaraguan refugees into the U.S., and the largest wave of documented immigrants. Many Nicaraguans also fled to nearby Costa Rica and other countries. Over 62 percent of the total documented immigration from 1979 to 1988 occurred after 1984.

Many Nicaraguans who immigrated did so to escape poverty, in Santa Clara County, California, the Nicaraguan public benefits recipients reported that in their families, 43% have one self-employed person or business owner, and 14% of the families have two such persons. However, nearly all of the estimated 200,000 Nicaraguans who fled to the United States (and other nearby Central American countries) between 1978 and 1979 returned after the victory of the Sandinistas in 1979.

==Culture and traditions==

Nicaraguan culture has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by European culture but enriched with Native American sounds and flavors. Nicaraguan culture can further be defined in several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by Iberian. It was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The Atlantic coast of the country, on the other hand, was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and indigenous languages. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as Jamaica, Belize, The Cayman Islands, and the Mosquito Coast of Honduras. The indigenous groups that were present in the Pacific coast have largely been assimilated into the mestizo culture, however, the indigenous people of the Caribbean coast have maintained a distinct identity.

Nicaraguan music is a mixture of Indigenous and European, especially Spanish, influences. Musical instruments include the marimba,and others common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers. The Atlantic coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of dance music called Palo de Mayo which is very much alive all throughout the country. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May. The Garifuna community exists in Nicaragua, known for its popular music called Punta.

Literature of Nicaragua can be traced to pre-Columbian times with the myths and oral literature that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still know in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature has historically been an important source of poetry in the Spanish-speaking world, with internationally renowned contributors such as Rubén Darío who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua, referred to as the &quot;Father of Modernism&quot; for leading the modernismo literary movement at the end of the 19th century. Other literary figures include Ernesto Cardenal, Gioconda Belli, Claribel Alegría and José Coronel Urtecho, among others.

&quot;El Güegüense&quot; is a satirical drama and was the first literary work of pre-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America&#x27;s most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua&#x27;s signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theater. The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest indigenous theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere. The story was published in a book in 1942 after many centuries.

===Language===


Spanish is spoken by about 90% of the country&#x27;s population. In Nicaragua the Voseo form is common, just as in other countries in Central and South America like Honduras, Argentina, Uruguay or coastal Colombia. Spanish has many different dialects spoken throughout Latin America, Nicaraguan Spanish is the dialect spoken in Nicaragua. In the Caribbean coast many afro-Nicaraguans and creoles speak English and creole English as their first language. Also in the Caribbean coast, many Indigenous people speak their native languages, such as the Miskito, Sumo, Rama and Garifuna language. In addition, many ethnic groups in Nicaragua, such as the German Nicaraguans, Chinese Nicaraguans and Palestinian Nicaraguans, have maintained their ancestral languages, which are minority languages, while also speaking Spanish and/or English. These minority languages include Chinese, Arabic, Italian, and German, among others.

The language and pronunciation varies depending on region. Some Nicaraguans pronounce the word &quot;vos&quot; with a strong &quot;s&quot; sound at the end. In the central part of the country, regions like Boaco pronounce &quot;vos&quot; without the &quot;s&quot; sound at the end. The result is &quot;vo&quot;, similar to &quot;vous&quot; in French and &quot;voi&quot; in Italian.

Nicaragua has a total of 4 extinct languages. Nicaraguan Sign Language is also of particular interest to linguists.

===Symbols===
The flag of Nicaragua was adopted on August 27, 1971. It is based on the flag of the United States of Central America. The two blue stripes represented the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean; while white symbolizes peace. A modern interpretation indicates that the color blue symbolizes justice and loyalty; while the color white represents virtue and purity. The coat of arms features an equilateral triangle which represents equality. Inside the triangle are five volcanoes, which represent the five members of the federation. The triangle also contains symbols of liberty and peace which is represented by a red Phrygian cap, white rays and a rainbow.

<doc id="1170080" wikidata="Q2960837" url="?curid=1170080" title="Charlie Brooker">
<text>Charlton Brooker (born 3 March 1971) is an English writer, television presenter, producer and satirist. He is the creator, writer, and an executive producer of the sci-fi drama anthology series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, and has written for comedy series such as &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, and &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;.

Brooker started his career as a cartoonist; he produced adverts for the second-hand video game retailer CeX before becoming a journalist for &quot;PC Zone.&quot; He has presented a number of television shows, mostly consisting of satirical and biting criticism of modern society and the media, such as &quot;Screenwipe&quot;, &quot;Gameswipe&quot;, &quot;Newswipe&quot;, &quot;Weekly Wipe&quot;, and &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;. He also wrote the 2008 horror drama series &quot;Dead Set&quot;. He has written social criticism pieces for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and is one of four creative directors of the production company Zeppotron.

== Early life and education==
Charlie Brooker was born on 3 March 1971 in Reading, Berkshire. He grew up in a relaxed Quaker household in Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, Oxfordshire. His parents were fans of the television sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot;, and named him Charlton after a character in one episode and his sister Samantha after the series&#x27; main character. As a teenager, he first worked as a writer and cartoonist for &quot;Oink!&quot;, a comic produced in the late 1980s.

After attending Wallingford School, Brooker attended the Polytechnic of Central London (which became the University of Westminster during his final year there) to study for a BA in Media Studies. He says that he did not graduate because his dissertation was written on video games, which was not considered an acceptable topic. He has listed his comedic influences as Monty Python, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Blackadder&quot;, Chris Morris and Vic Reeves.

Brooker did some early work as a cartoonist, and worked in the video game department of Music and Video Exchange, a retailer in Notting Hill Gate, London. When one of the employees left to found the second-hand retailer CeX, Brooker worked in their first shop, produced cartoon advertisements, and designed their logo.

== Career ==

=== Print ===
After some of Brooker&#x27;s CeX cartoons were printed in the magazine &quot;PC Zone&quot;, he was invited to write for the magazine. His early reviews included &quot;System Shock&quot; (1994) and &quot;Fallout&quot; (1997). Brooker wrote for the magazine throughout the mid- to late-1990s. Aside from games reviews, his output included the comic strip &quot;Cybertwats&quot; and a column titled &quot;Sick Notes&quot;, where Brooker would insult anyone who wrote in to the magazine – and offered a £50 prize to the best letter. One of Brooker&#x27;s one-shot cartoons caused the magazine to be pulled from the shelves of many British newsagents. The cartoon was titled &quot;Helmut Werstler&#x27;s Cruelty Zoo&quot; and professed to be an advert for a theme park created by a Teutonic psychologist for children to take out their violent impulses on animals rather than humans. It was accompanied by photoshopped pictures of children smashing the skulls of monkeys with hammers, jumping on a badger with a pitchfork, and chainsawing an orang-utan, among other things. The original joke was supposed to be at the expense of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games, known at the time for the number of animals killed, but the original title, &quot;Lara Croft&#x27;s Cruelty Zoo&quot;, was changed for legal reasons. In October 2008, Brooker and several other ex-writers were invited back to review a game for the 200th issue. Brooker reviewed &quot;Euro Truck Simulator&quot;.

Brooker began writing a TV review column titled &quot;Screen Burn&quot; for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Saturday entertainment supplement &quot;The Guide&quot; in 2000, a role he continued until October 2010.

From late 2005, he wrote a regular series of columns in &quot;The Guardian&quot; supplement &quot;G2&quot; on Fridays called &quot;Supposing&quot;, in which he free-associated on a set of vague what-if themes. From October 2006 this column was expanded into a full-page section on Mondays, including samples from TVGoHome and Ignopedia, an occasional series of pseudo-articles on topics mostly suggested by readers. The key theme behind Ignopedia was that, while Wikipedia is written and edited by thousands of users, Ignopedia would be written by a single sub-par person with little or no awareness of the facts.

On 24 October 2004, he wrote a column on George W. Bush and the forthcoming 2004 US presidential election which concluded, &quot;John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley, Jr. – where are you now that we need you?&quot; that was criticised for Brooker&#x27;s apparent encouragement of the assassination of the American president. &quot;The Guardian&quot; withdrew the article from its website and published and endorsed an apology by Brooker. He has since commented about the remark in the column stating: 

Brooker left the &quot;Screen Burn&quot; column in 2010. In the final column, he noted how increasingly difficult he found it to reconcile his role in mainstream media and TV production with his writing as a scabrous critic or to objectively criticise those he increasingly worked and socialised with. Longtime covering contributor Grace Dent took over the column. He continued to contribute other articles to &quot;The Guardian&quot; on a regular basis, his most recent comment column appearing in May 2015.

In 2012, he contributed to the book &quot;Behind the Sofa: Celebrity Memories of Doctor Who&quot;.

In 2014, an article he wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot;—&quot;Too much talk for one planet: why I&#x27;m reducing my word emissions&quot;—was published in the A-Level anthology &quot;Voices in Speech and Writing: An Anthology&quot;.

=== Online ===
From 1999 to 2003, Brooker wrote the satirical &quot;TVGoHome&quot; website, a regular series of mock TV schedules published in a format similar to that of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, consisting of a combination of savage satire and surreal humour and featured in technology newsletter Need To Know. A print adaptation of the site was published by Fourth Estate in 2001. A TV sketch show based on the site was broadcast on UK digital station E4 the same year.

In May 2012, Brooker was interviewed for Richard Herring&#x27;s &quot;Leicester Square Theatre Podcast&quot; series. In 2019, he made a second appearance on the podcast, which was released during March 2020.

=== Television ===

Brooker&#x27;s television presenting debut was with Gia Milinovich on BBC Knowledge&#x27;s &quot;The Kit&quot; (1999–2000), a programme that reviewed gadgets and technology. From 1999 to 2000, Brooker played the hooded expert &#x27;the Pundit&#x27; in the short-lived show &quot;Games Republic&quot;, hosted by Trevor and Simon on BSkyB.

In 2000, Brooker was one of the writers of the Channel 4 show &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;. In 2001, he was one of several writers on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Brass Eye&quot; special on the subject of paedophilia. In 2003, Brooker wrote an episode entitled &quot;How to Watch Television&quot; for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Art Show&quot;. The episode was presented in the style of a public information film and was partly animated.

Together with &quot;Brass Eye&quot;&#x27;s Chris Morris, Brooker co-wrote the sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, based on a character from one of TVGoHome&#x27;s fictional programmes. The show was broadcast in 2005 and focused on the lives of a group of London media &#x27;trendies&#x27;. The same year, he was also on the writing team of the Channel 4 sketch show &quot;Spoons&quot;, produced by Zeppotron.

==== &quot;Wipe&quot; series ====
In 2006, Brooker began writing and presenting the television series &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Screenwipe&quot; on BBC Four, a TV review programme in a similar style to his &quot;Screen Burn&quot; columns in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. After an initial pilot series of three editions in April, the programme returned later in the year for a second run of four episodes plus Christmas and Review of the Year specials in December 2006. A third series followed in February 2007 with a fourth broadcast in September 2007, followed by a Review of the Year in December 2007. The fifth series started in November 2008 and was followed by another Review of the Year special. This series was also the first to be given a primetime repeat on terrestrial television (BBC Two), in January 2009.

&quot;Screenwipe&quot; editions have had themes including American television, TV news, advertising and children&#x27;s programmes. The last of these involved a segment where Brooker joined the cast of &quot;Toonattik&quot; for one week, playing the character of &quot;Angry News Guy&quot;. An episode on scriptwriting saw several of British television&#x27;s most prominent writers interviewed by Brooker.

&quot;Newswipe with Charlie Brooker&quot;, a similar show concerned with current affairs reporting by the international news media, began on BBC Four on 25 March 2009. A second series began on 19 January 2010. He has also written and presented the one-off special &quot;Gameswipe&quot; on video games and aired on BBC Four on 29 September 2009.

Brooker&#x27;s &quot;2010 Wipe&quot;, a review of 2010, was broadcast in December 2010. The end-of-year &quot;Wipe&quot; specials continued annually, the last one to date broadcast on 29 December 2016. Due to Brooker&#x27;s commitments to &quot;Black Mirror&quot; and other projects, the annual Wipe went on hiatus from 2017
onwards.

&quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Weekly Wipe&quot; was first broadcast on BBC Two on 31 January 2013. It was an amalgam of &quot;Screenwipe&quot; and &quot;Newswipe&quot;, with sections that dealt withrecent news, television shows and films. Along with the regular cast, it also featured guests who discuss recent events. Two more series followed in 2014 and 2015. A 60-minute special, &quot;Election Wipe&quot;, aired on 6 May 2015, examined events running up to the 2015 general election.

A 45-minute BBC Two special, &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Antiviral Wipe&quot;, aired on 14 May 2020. It concerned life during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. It was produced during the UK lockdown, which had caused a series starring &quot;Wipe&quot; character Philomena Cunk to be postponed. Most of the crew from the series transferred to work on &quot;Antiviral Wipe&quot;. Brooker initially turned down the offer to make the special but accepted when it was clear that production would be largely unchanged, as the format of the series required few characters to appear on screen together and made extensive use of archive footage. The editing process was the most affected aspect of production.

Brooker often signs off his programmes by saying &quot;Thank you for watching. Now go away.&quot;

==== &quot;Dead Set&quot; ====
Brooker wrote &quot;Dead Set&quot;, a five-part zombie horror thriller for E4 set in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house. The show was broadcast in October 2008 to coincide with Halloween and was repeated on Channel 4 in January 2009 to coincide with &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, and again for Halloween later that year. It was produced by Zeppotron, which also produced &quot;Screenwipe&quot;.

Brooker told MediaGuardian.co.uk it comprised a &quot;mixture of known and less well known faces&quot; and &quot;Dead Set is very different to anything I&#x27;ve done before, and I hope the end result will surprise, entertain and appall people in equal measure.&quot; He added that he has long been a fan of horror films and that his new series &quot;could not be described as a comedy&quot;. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t really describe what it is but it will probably surprise people,&quot; Brooker said, adding that he plans to &quot;continue as normal&quot; with his print journalism.

Jaime Winstone starred as a runner on the TV programme, and &quot;Big Brother&quot; presenter Davina McCall guest starred as herself. Dead Set received a BAFTA nomination for &quot;Best Drama Serial&quot;.

==== &quot;Black Mirror&quot; ====
In December 2011, three episodes of Brooker&#x27;s &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, a science fiction anthology series, aired on Channel 4 to largely positive reviews. As well as creating the show, Brooker wrote the first episode and co-wrote the second with his wife Konnie Huq. He also wrote all three episodes of series two. In September 2015, Netflix commissioned a third season of 12 episodes, with Channel 4 losing the rights to the programme. A trailer for the third season was released in October 2016. This was later split into two series of six episodes. The third season was released on Netflix worldwide on 21 October 2016. Brooker has solely written four of the episodes in series three, and has co-written the remaining two.

The fourth season was released in December 2017, followed by a full-length interactive film &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; in December 2018. The fifth season was released in June 2019.

The series is produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. Regarding the programme&#x27;s content and structure, Brooker noted, &quot;each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they&#x27;re all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes&#x27; time if we&#x27;re clumsy.&quot;

An Endemol press release describes the series as &quot;a hybrid of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; which taps into our contemporary unease about our modern world&quot;, with the stories having a &quot;techno-paranoia&quot; feel. Channel 4 describes the first episode as &quot;a twisted parable for the Twitter age&quot;.

Brooker explained the series&#x27; title to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noting: &quot;If technology is a drug – and it does feel like a drug – then what, precisely, are the side-effects? This area – between delight and discomfort – is where &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, my new drama series, is set. The &#x27;black mirror&#x27; of the title is the one you&#x27;ll find on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitor, a smartphone.&quot;

Several news reports, including one by Chris Cillizza, political reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, compared the 2016 Donald Trump political campaign to &quot;The Waldo Moment&quot;, a 2013 episode of the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; TV series; later, in September 2016, Brooker also compared the Trump campaign to the episode and rightly predicted Trump would win the 2016 election.

==== Other television work and appearances ====

With Daniel Maier, he co-wrote a spoof crime drama for Sky1 called &quot;A Touch of Cloth&quot;, which first broadcast on 26 August 2012 and starred John Hannah and Suranne Jones, both notable for having starred in genuine crime dramas. Two further series were broadcast in 2013 and 2014, with the latter starring Karen Gillan.

Brooker has appeared on three episodes and one webisode of the popular BBC current affairs news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He appeared on an episode of the Channel 4 panel show &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2009&quot;, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; and &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;. In December 2006 he reviewed two games written by the presenters of &quot;VideoGaiden&quot;, on their show. He also made a brief appearance in the third and final instalment of the documentary series &quot;Games Britannia&quot;, discussing the rise and popularity of computer games.

Brooker wrote for the BBC Three sketch show &quot;Rush Hour&quot;.

In 2009, Brooker began hosting &quot;You Have Been Watching&quot;, a panel comedy TV quiz on Channel 4 which discusses television. A second series was broadcast the following year.

On 6 May 2010, Brooker was a co-host of the Channel 4 alternative election night, along with David Mitchell, Jimmy Carr and Lauren Laverne. The telethon was interspersed with contributions from Brooker, some live in the studio but mostly pre-recorded. Notably, these included an &quot;Election Special&quot; of &quot;You Have Been Watching&quot; and two smaller segments in an almost identical style to &quot;Screenwipe&quot; (the only noticeable difference being that Brooker was sitting in a different room). Brooker described the experience of live television as being so nerve-wracking he &quot;did a piss&quot; during the broadcast. A spin-off series, &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;, started in January 2011 with the same four hosts.

Brooker hosted &quot;How TV Ruined Your Life&quot;, which aired on BBC Two between January and March 2011.

In November 2020, Hugh Grant reported that Brooker was producing a mockumentary with Netflix &quot;about 2020&quot;. Grant stated that he would star as &quot;a historian who is being interviewed about the year.&quot; The mockumentary, titled &quot;Death to 2020&quot;, was released on Netflix on 27 December 2020.

In 2022, the animated interactive fiction &quot;Cat Burglar&quot; was released. Brooker was credited as creator.

=== Radio ===
From 2010 to 2012, Brooker presented a BBC Radio 4 series celebrating failure titled &quot;So Wrong It&#x27;s Right&quot;, in which guests compete to pitch the worst possible ideas for new franchises and give the &quot;most wrong&quot; answer to a question. It aired 17 episodes across three series. In common with &quot;Screenwipe&#x27;s&quot; use of a Grandaddy track (&quot;A.M. 180&quot;) from the album &quot;Under the Western Freeway&quot; as its theme tune, &quot;So Wrong It&#x27;s Right&quot; uses another track from the same album, &quot;Summer Here Kids&quot;.

In January 2018 he was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Brooker became engaged to former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Konnie Huq after dating for nine months, having met while filming an episode of &quot;Screenwipe&quot;. They married on 26 July 2010 at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. They have two children, both sons. Rupa Huq, the Member of Parliament for Ealing Central and Acton, is Brooker&#x27;s sister-in-law.

Brooker is an atheist and contributed to &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Guide to Christmas&quot;. Due to his family&#x27;s background, he has also described himself as a Quaker.

== Awards and nominations ==

For his work as creator and screenwriter of &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, Brooker won three consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Television Movie and two consecutive for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special.

Brooker won the 2009 Columnist of the Year award at the British Press Awards for his &quot;Guardian&quot; column. &quot;Dead Set&quot; was nominated for the 2009 Best Drama Serial BAFTA. In 2010, he was given the Best Entertainment Programme Award for &quot;Newswipe&quot; from the Royal Television Society. He has received three British Comedy Awards: Best Newcomer in 2009, Best Comedy Entertainment Show Award for &quot;Newswipe&quot; in 2011 and Best Comedy Entertainment Personality in 2012. At the BAFTA TV Awards 2017, his show &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s 2016 Wipe&quot; won for Best Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme.

<text>M. A. Bonnie Brown (born March 2, 1941) is a former Canadian member of Parliament for the riding of Oakville and a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Politically, she is considered to have been on the left wing of her party.

==Biography==
Brown was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She first sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1988 federal election in the Oakville—Milton riding, where she came second. At the next federal election in 1993, Brown was elected. After Oakville—Milton was divided into two ridings, Oakville and Halton, she was re-elected in Oakville in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006. In the 2006 election, she won by a margin of 744 votes. She lost to Conservative Party of Canada candidate Terence Young in the October 14, 2008 federal election.

Prior to entering politics full-time, Brown was employed as a social worker and teacher. She was elected as a school trustee in 1987 and was then elected to the Oakville, Ontario Town Council, and later, the Halton Regional Council. In 1993, she replaced retiring incumbent Otto Jelinek (PC) as the member of Parliament for the riding of Oakville—Milton.

She served as chair of the Liberal Caucus Committee on Social Policy before being elected chair of the Commons all-party Standing Committee on Health. During her time on the Commons Health Committee, she recommended that patents on human genes should not be allowed.

Brown opposed the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. She also opposed Canada&#x27;s involvement in a United States-led missile defence program proposal. She was also influential in Canada&#x27;s ratification of the Kyoto Accord on Climate Change.

She was involved with the Advancement of Women Halton, a group that advocates for women&#x27;s issues.

<text>Princess Royal was a British merchant ship and blockade runner that became a cruiser in the Union Navy during the American Civil War and later returned to civilian service.

==British merchant service==
&quot;Princess Royal&quot; was launched on 20 June 1861 by the Glasgow shipbuilders Tod &amp; McGregor in 1861 as a passenger-cargo ship for the Liverpool services of M Langlands &amp; Sons, Glasgow, their first iron screw steamer. She measured 652 gross and 494 net register tons, with a length of , breadth and depth of hold . The ship was powered by a two-cylinder steam engine of 150-170 nhp driving a single propeller. She was registered at Glasgow and entered service in July 1861.

In 1863 the Confederate Government had major contracts for large and specialised British manufactures, including steam engines and boilers for ironclads under construction at Charleston, South Carolina, heavy artillery and armament-making machinery. The government&#x27;s UK representative, Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Co, arranged the purchase of &quot;Princess Royal&quot; by private investors to carry these and other supplies direct to Charleston. The ship sailed from London on 8 December 1862 but called at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Federal spies gained valuable information on the ship and her cargo. After a further call at Bermuda, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; sailed for Charleston, but in the early hours of 29 January 1863 she was seen as she approached the port entrance by the Federal blockade squadron and forced aground. The captain, pilot and some passengers and crew were able to escape before boarding parties from USS &quot;Unadilla&quot; and &quot;G. W. Blunt&quot; could arrive. The ship was sent to the Philadelphia Prize court for adjudication.

==US naval service==
&quot;Princess Royal&quot; was purchased by the United States Navy from the prize court on 18 March 1863, fitted out as a cruiser and commissioned 29 May 1863, Commander Melancthon B. Woolsey in command.

Assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, &quot;Princess Royal&quot; participated in the engagement with Confederate forces at Donaldsonville, Louisiana, 28 June 1863. Then ordered to the Texas coast, she captured the British schooner &quot;Flying Scud&quot; near Matamoros, Tamaulipas 12 August, and assisted in seizing the schooner &quot;Wave&quot; 22 August. Continuing her patrols into 1864 she took &quot;Neptune&quot; off Brazos de Santiago, 19 November 1864; ran down the schooner &quot;Flash&quot; six days later; seized the schooner &quot;Alabama&quot;, 7 December; and captured &quot;Cora&quot; off Galveston, 19 December.

On 7 February 1865, she assisted in the capture of her last prize, the schooner &quot;Anna Sophia&quot; in Galveston Bay. Five months later &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was ordered north, arriving at Philadelphia 21 July. She was sold at public auction 17 August 1865.

==Post war==
USS &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, now measuring 932 grt, was purchased by William F Weld &amp; Co of Boston, renamed &quot;Sherman&quot; after the Federal general, and put onto the Boston-New York-New Orleans service.

On 8 January 1874, on a voyage from New York to New Orleans, &quot;Sherman&quot; sprang a leak off the North Carolina coast and anchored near Little River. The following day she sank off Cape Fear. The passengers and crew were saved, along with some cargo.

<doc id="1170093" wikidata="Q6232621" url="?curid=1170093" title="John Facenda">
<text>John Thomas Ralph Augustine James Facenda ( ; August 8, 1913September 26, 1984) was an American broadcaster and sports announcer. He was a fixture on Philadelphia radio and television for decades, and achieved national fame as a narrator for NFL Films and &quot;Football Follies&quot;. Through his work with NFL Films, Facenda was known by many National Football League fans as &quot;The Voice of God&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Facenda had six brothers and six sisters. His father was an immigrant from Italy who went from Portsmouth, Virginia, to help with building the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia while his wife and children remained in Virginia. Facenda attended Roman Catholic High School in Center City, Philadelphia and then later Villanova University but dropped out.

===Radio and television work===
In 1948, Facenda became an anchorman at WCAU-TV (which was then Philadelphia&#x27;s CBS television affiliate), a role that he held until 1973. While there, he began the station&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscasts.

Among Facenda&#x27;s writers was John Du Bois, a noted newsman with the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; and &quot;County Press&quot;.

===NFL Films===
One night in 1965, Facenda went to a local tavern, the RDA Club, which happened to be showing footage produced by NFL Films. He enjoyed the slow-motion game sequences that were already an NFL Films trademark and would later recall:

Thus began Facenda&#x27;s association with NFL Films, one that would continue until his death. Facenda narrated many highlight films during his career with the company. His dulcet baritone was the perfect match for the highly dramatic nature of the footage he narrated, and earned him the nickname &quot;The Voice of God&quot;. Probably one of the best-remembered (and most frequently-quoted) examples of Facenda&#x27;s NFL Films narration is something he never actually said: &quot;the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field&quot; was a quote sportscaster Chris Berman made up, mimicking Facenda&#x27;s voice when he said it. Steve Sabol, son of Ed, claimed that &quot;John may have made a game seem more important than it was because he read lines with a dramatic directness.&quot; Bob Costas called Facenda&#x27;s voice &quot;one of the most remarkable instruments in the history of broadcasting.&quot;

Facenda was at the pinnacle of his style in 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Championship Chase&quot; with his recitation of &quot;The Autumn Wind&quot;, a football poem written by Steve Sabol, personifying fall weather:

&lt;poem&gt;
The Autumn wind is a pirate
Blustering in from sea
With a rollicking song he sweeps along
Swaggering boisterously.
His face is weatherbeaten
He wears a hooded sash
With a silver hat about his head
And a bristling black mustache
He growls as he storms the country
A villain big and bold
And the trees all shake and quiver and quake
As he robs them of their gold.
The Autumn wind is a Raider
Pillaging just for fun
He&#x27;ll knock you &#x27;round and upside down
And laugh when he&#x27;s conquered and won.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem and its accompanying theme music have become an anthem of the Las Vegas Raiders. It is also known as the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Raider Nation&quot;.

===Speaking style===
To this day, Facenda&#x27;s speaking style remains the sound most closely linked with NFL Films, and, in some ways, football narration itself. The style is frequently emulated, often in a parodic manner, in contemporary sports news, advertising, and even other sports-themed entertainment (for example, Green Day&#x27;s music video for the 1999 song &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;). Similarly, Facenda&#x27;s voice is so closely associated with the NFL that in July 2006, Facenda&#x27;s son filed a lawsuit against the NFL, claiming that Facenda&#x27;s voice was used without permission in an NFL Network program promoting the video game &quot;Madden NFL 06&quot;.

A room in the internet virtual Professional Football History Museum is called &quot;The Facenda Audio-Visual Room&quot; in Facenda&#x27;s honor.

Facenda narrated a documentary on Notre Dame Football in 1982 titled &quot;Wake Up the Echoes&quot;, one of the few times he put his voice to something that wasn&#x27;t NFL-related (although it was NFL Films-produced). A few months prior to his death, Facenda narrated the season highlight film for the 1983 Miami Hurricanes, which won the first of the school&#x27;s five national championships in a 19-season span (1983–2001).

===End of anchorman career===
In the early 1970s, rival WFIL-TV adopted the &quot;Action News&quot; format based on the news broadcasts heard on Top 40 radio stations and heavily influenced by tabloid newspapers. Brief coverage was given to almost every event happening in town. WCAU&#x27;s ratings collapsed, and network executives decided that they needed a younger anchor to complement the 60-year-old Facenda. In 1972, 27-year-old Judd Hambrick was brought in as co-anchor. With the first wave of baby boomers entering broadcasting, Facenda decided to step down and make way for the next generation. His last newscast as anchor for WCAU was on March 23, 1973. Many viewers were upset over the loss of Facenda, and his retirement failed to improve ratings. (Part of the decline of WCAU&#x27;s ratings can also be attributed to rival KYW hiring Jessica Savitch as one of its primary co-anchors in 1972.)

After stepping down as anchor, Facenda continued to work for WCAU in various capacities as a narrator, program director, and host of special reports. He was co-anchor for the station&#x27;s coverage of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Philadelphia in 1979. For many years, he was also the familiar voice of the John Wanamaker Department Store&#x27;s Christmas Light Show. In 1983, he narrated the NFL Films production of &quot;Frontiers and Beyond&quot;, the tour documentary of the rock band Journey. Twelve days before Facenda died, he was presented with the Governor&#x27;s Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Philadelphia chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Facenda was named Person of the Year by the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia in 1971 and was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Death==

Facenda died of cancer on September 26, 1984, at the age of 71.

In 1986, Facenda was posthumously honored with the Ralph Hay Pioneer Award. In 2021, Facenda was honored again by the hall with the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award, making him and Joe Browne the only two people to be given two separate auxiliary honors by the hall. As of 2024, neither have yet to be fully inducted in Canton as well.

<text>A Hopfield network (or associative memory) is a form of recurrent neural network, or a spin glass system, that can serve as a content-addressable memory. The Hopfield network, named for John Hopfield, consists of a single layer of neurons, where each neuron is connected to every other neuron except itself. These connections are bidirectional and symmetric, meaning the weight of the connection from neuron &quot;i&quot; to neuron &quot;j&quot; is the same as the weight from neuron &quot;j&quot; to neuron &quot;i&quot;. Patterns are associatively recalled by fixing certain inputs, and dynamically evolve the network to minimize an energy function, towards local energy minimum states that correspond to stored patterns. Patterns are associatively learned (or &quot;stored&quot;) by a Hebbian learning algorithm.

One of the key features of Hopfield networks is their ability to recover complete patterns from partial or noisy inputs, making them robust in the face of incomplete or corrupted data. Their connection to statistical mechanics, recurrent networks, and human cognitive psychology has led to their application in various fields, including physics, psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning theory and practice.

== History ==

One origin of associative memory is human cognitive psychology, specifically the associative memory. Frank Rosenblatt studied &quot;close-loop cross-coupled perceptrons&quot;, which are 3-layered perceptron networks whose middle layer contains recurrent connections that change by a Hebbian learning rule.

Another model of associative memory is where the output does not loop back to the input. W. K. Taylor proposed such a model trained by Hebbian learning in 1956. Karl Steinbuch, who wanted to understand learning, and inspired by watching his children learn, published the Lernmatrix in 1961. It was translated to English in 1963. Similar research was done with the &quot;correlogram&quot; of D. J. Willshaw et al. in 1969. Teuvo Kohonen trained an associative memory by gradient descent in 1974.
Another origin of associative memory was statistical mechanics. The Ising model was published in 1920s as a model of magnetism, however it studied the thermal equilibrium, which does not change with time. Roy J. Glauber in 1963 studied the Ising model evolving in time, as a process towards thermal equilibrium (Glauber dynamics), adding in the component of time.

The second component to be added was adaptation to stimulus. Described independently by Kaoru Nakano in 1971 and Shun&#x27;ichi Amari in 1972, they proposed to modify the weights of an Ising model by Hebbian learning rule as a model of associative memory. The same idea was published by in 1974, who was acknowledged by Hopfield in his 1982 paper.

See Carpenter (1989) and Cowan (1990) for a technical description of some of these early works in associative memory.

The Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model of spin glass, published in 1975, is the Hopfield network with random initialization. Sherrington and Kirkpatrick found that it is highly likely for the energy function of the SK model to have many local minima. In the 1982 paper, Hopfield applied this recently developed theory to study the Hopfield network with binary activation functions. In a 1984 paper he extended this to continuous activation functions. It became a standard model for the study of neural networks through statistical mechanics.

A major advance in memory storage capacity was developed by Dimitry Krotov and Hopfield in 2016 through a change in network dynamics and energy function. This idea was further extended by Demircigil and collaborators in 2017. The continuous dynamics of large memory capacity models was developed in a series of papers between 2016 and 2020. Large memory storage capacity Hopfield Networks are now called Dense Associative Memories or modern Hopfield networks.

In 2024, John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their foundational contributions to machine learning, such as the Hopfield network.

==Structure==

The units in Hopfield nets are binary threshold units, i.e. the units only take on two different values for their states, and the value is determined by whether or not the unit&#x27;s input exceeds its threshold formula_1. Discrete Hopfield nets describe relationships between binary (firing or not-firing) neurons formula_2. At a certain time, the state of the neural net is described by a vector formula_3, which records which neurons are firing in a binary word of formula_4 bits.

The interactions formula_5 between neurons have units that usually take on values of 1 or −1, and this convention will be used throughout this article. However, other literature might use units that take values of 0 and 1. These interactions are &quot;learned&quot; via Hebb&#x27;s law of association, such that, for a certain state formula_6 and distinct nodes formula_7

formula_8

but formula_9.

(Note that the Hebbian learning rule takes the form formula_10 when the units assume values in formula_11.)

Once the network is trained, formula_5 no longer evolve. If a new state of neurons formula_13 is introduced to the neural network, the net acts on neurons such that

* formula_14 if formula_15
* formula_16 if formula_17

where formula_18 is the threshold value of the i&#x27;th neuron (often taken to be 0). In this way, Hopfield networks have the ability to &quot;remember&quot; states stored in the interaction matrix, because if a new state formula_19 is subjected to the interaction matrix, each neuron will change until it matches the original state formula_20 (see the Updates section below).

The connections in a Hopfield net typically have the following restrictions:
* formula_21 (no unit has a connection with itself)
* formula_22 (connections are symmetric)

The constraint that weights are symmetric guarantees that the energy function decreases monotonically while following the activation rules. A network with asymmetric weights may exhibit some periodic or chaotic behaviour; however, Hopfield found that this behavior is confined to relatively small parts of the phase space and does not impair the network&#x27;s ability to act as a content-addressable associative memory system.

Hopfield also modeled neural nets for continuous values, in which the electric output of each neuron is not binary but some value between 0 and 1. He found that this type of network was also able to store and reproduce memorized states.

Notice that every pair of units &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; in a Hopfield network has a connection that is described by the connectivity weight formula_5. In this sense, the Hopfield network can be formally described as a complete undirected graph formula_24, where formula_25 is a set of McCulloch–Pitts neurons and formula_26 is a function that links pairs of units to a real value, the connectivity weight.

==Updating==

Updating one unit (node in the graph simulating the artificial neuron) in the Hopfield network is performed using the following rule:

formula_27

where:
* formula_28 is the strength of the connection weight from unit j to unit i (the weight of the connection).
* formula_29 is the state of unit i.
* formula_30 is the threshold of unit i.

Updates in the Hopfield network can be performed in two different ways:
* Asynchronous: Only one unit is updated at a time. This unit can be picked at random, or a pre-defined order can be imposed from the very beginning.
* Synchronous: All units are updated at the same time. This requires a central clock to the system in order to maintain synchronization. This method is viewed by some as less realistic, based on an absence of observed global clock influencing analogous biological or physical systems of interest.

===Neurons &quot;attract or repel each other&quot; in state space ===
The weight between two units has a powerful impact upon the values of the neurons. Consider the connection weight formula_28 between two neurons i and j. If formula_32, the updating rule implies that:
* when formula_33, the contribution of &quot;j&quot; in the weighted sum is positive. Thus, formula_34 is pulled by &quot;j&quot; towards its value formula_35
* when formula_36, the contribution of &quot;j&quot; in the weighted sum is negative. Then again, formula_29 is pushed by &quot;j&quot; towards its value formula_38

Thus, the values of neurons &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; will converge if the weight between them is positive. Similarly, they will diverge if the weight is negative.

== Convergence properties of discrete and continuous Hopfield networks ==

Bruck in his paper in 1990  studied discrete Hopfield networks and proved a generalized convergence theorem that is based on the connection between the network&#x27;s dynamics and cuts in the associated graph. This generalization covered both asynchronous as well as synchronous dynamics and presented elementary proofs based on greedy algorithms for max-cut in graphs. A subsequent paper further investigated the behavior of any neuron in both discrete-time and continuous-time Hopfield networks when the corresponding energy function is minimized during an optimization process. Bruck showed that neuron &quot;j&quot; changes its state &quot;if and only if&quot; it further decreases the following biased pseudo-cut. The discrete Hopfield network minimizes the following biased pseudo-cut for the synaptic weight matrix of the Hopfield net.

formula_39

where formula_40 and formula_41 represents the set of neurons which are −1 and +1, respectively, at time formula_42. For further details, see the recent paper.

The discrete-time Hopfield Network always minimizes exactly the following pseudo-cut

: formula_43

The continuous-time Hopfield network always minimizes an upper bound to the following weighted cut

: formula_44

where formula_45 is a zero-centered sigmoid function.

The complex Hopfield network, on the other hand, generally tends to minimize the so-called shadow-cut of the complex weight matrix of the net.

==Energy==

Hopfield nets have a scalar value associated with each state of the network, referred to as the &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, of the network, where:
:formula_46

This quantity is called &quot;energy&quot; because it either decreases or stays the same upon network units being updated. Furthermore, under repeated updating the network will eventually converge to a state which is a local minimum in the energy function (which is considered to be a Lyapunov function). Thus, if a state is a local minimum in the energy function it is a stable state for the network. Note that this energy function belongs to a general class of models in physics under the name of Ising models; these in turn are a special case of Markov networks, since the associated probability measure, the Gibbs measure, has the Markov property.

== Hopfield network in optimization ==

Hopfield and Tank presented the Hopfield network application in solving the classical traveling-salesman problem in 1985. Since then, the Hopfield network has been widely used for optimization. The idea of using the Hopfield network in optimization problems is straightforward: If a constrained/unconstrained cost function can be written in the form of the Hopfield energy function E, then there exists a Hopfield network whose equilibrium points represent solutions to the constrained/unconstrained optimization problem.  Minimizing the Hopfield energy function both minimizes the objective function and satisfies the constraints also as the constraints are &quot;embedded&quot; into the synaptic weights of the network. Although including the optimization constraints into the synaptic weights in the best possible way is a challenging task, many difficult optimization problems with constraints in different disciplines have been converted to the Hopfield energy function: Associative memory systems, Analog-to-Digital conversion, job-shop scheduling problem, quadratic assignment and other related NP-complete problems, channel allocation problem in wireless networks, mobile ad-hoc network routing problem, image restoration, system identification, combinatorial optimization, etc, just to name a few. However, while it is possible to convert hard optimization problems to Hopfield energy functions, it does not guarantee convergence to a solution (even in exponential time).

== Initialization and running ==

Initialization of the Hopfield networks is done by setting the values of the units to the desired start pattern. Repeated updates are then performed until the network converges to an attractor pattern. Convergence is generally assured, as Hopfield proved that the attractors of this nonlinear dynamical system are stable, not periodic or chaotic as in some other systems. Therefore, in the context of Hopfield networks, an attractor pattern is a final stable state, a pattern that cannot change any value within it under updating.

==Training==
Training a Hopfield net involves lowering the energy of states that the net should &quot;remember&quot;. This allows the net to serve as a content addressable memory system, that is to say, the network will converge to a &quot;remembered&quot; state if it is given only part of the state. The net can be used to recover from a distorted input to the trained state that is most similar to that input. This is called associative memory because it recovers memories on the basis of similarity. For example, if we train a Hopfield net with five units so that the state (1, −1, 1, −1, 1) is an energy minimum, and we give the network the state (1, −1, −1, −1, 1) it will converge to (1, −1, 1, −1, 1). Thus, the network is properly trained when the energy of states which the network should remember are local minima. Note that, in contrast to Perceptron training, the thresholds of the neurons are never updated.

===Learning rules===
There are various different learning rules that can be used to store information in the memory of the Hopfield network. It is desirable for a learning rule to have both of the following two properties:
* &quot;Local&quot;: A learning rule is &quot;local&quot; if each weight is updated using information available to neurons on either side of the connection that is associated with that particular weight.
* &quot;Incremental&quot;: New patterns can be learned without using information from the old patterns that have been also used for training. That is, when a new pattern is used for training, the new values for the weights only depend on the old values and on the new pattern.

These properties are desirable, since a learning rule satisfying them is more biologically plausible. For example, since the human brain is always learning new concepts, one can reason that human learning is incremental. A learning system that was not incremental would generally be trained only once, with a huge batch of training data.

===Hebbian learning rule for Hopfield networks===
Hebbian theory was introduced by Donald Hebb in 1949 in order to explain &quot;associative learning&quot;, in which simultaneous activation of neuron cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It is often summarized as &quot;Neurons that fire together wire together. Neurons that fire out of sync fail to link&quot;.

The Hebbian rule is both local and incremental. For the Hopfield networks, it is implemented in the following manner when learning formula_47
binary patterns:

formula_48

where formula_49 represents bit i from pattern formula_50.

If the bits corresponding to neurons i and j are equal in pattern formula_50, then the product formula_52 will be positive. This would, in turn, have a positive effect on the weight formula_53 and the values of i and j will tend to become equal. The opposite happens if the bits corresponding to neurons i and j are different.

===Storkey learning rule===
This rule was introduced by Amos Storkey in 1997 and is both local and incremental. Storkey also showed that a Hopfield network trained using this rule has a greater capacity than a corresponding network trained using the Hebbian rule. The weight matrix of an attractor neural network is said to follow the Storkey learning rule if it obeys:

formula_54

where formula_55 is a form of &quot;local field&quot; at neuron i.
This learning rule is local, since the synapses take into account only neurons at their sides. The rule makes use of more information from the patterns and weights than the generalized Hebbian rule, due to the effect of the local field.

==Spurious patterns==

Patterns that the network uses for training (called &quot;retrieval states&quot;) become attractors of the system. Repeated updates would eventually lead to convergence to one of the retrieval states. However, sometimes the network will converge to spurious patterns (different from the training patterns). In fact, the number of spurious patterns can be exponential in the number of stored patterns, even if the stored patterns are orthogonal. The energy in these spurious patterns is also a local minimum. For each stored pattern x, the negation -x is also a spurious pattern.

A spurious state can also be a linear combination of an odd number of retrieval states. For example, when using 3 patterns formula_56, one can get the following spurious state:

formula_57

Spurious patterns that have an even number of states cannot exist, since they might sum up to zero

==Capacity==

The Network capacity of the Hopfield network model is determined by neuron amounts and connections within a given network. Therefore, the number of memories that are able to be stored is dependent on neurons and connections. Furthermore, it was shown that the recall accuracy between vectors and nodes was 0.138 (approximately 138 vectors can be recalled from storage for every 1000 nodes) (Hertz et al., 1991). Therefore, it is evident that many mistakes will occur if one tries to store a large number of vectors. When the Hopfield model does not recall the right pattern, it is possible that an intrusion has taken place, since semantically related items tend to confuse the individual, and recollection of the wrong pattern occurs. Therefore, the Hopfield network model is shown to confuse one stored item with that of another upon retrieval. Perfect recalls and high capacity, &gt;0.14, can be loaded in the network by Storkey learning method; ETAM, ETAM experiments also in. Ulterior models inspired by the Hopfield network were later devised to raise the storage limit and reduce the retrieval error rate, with some being capable of one-shot learning.

The storage capacity can be given as formula_58 where formula_47 is the number of neurons in the net.

==Human memory==
The Hopfield network is a model for human associative learning and recall. It accounts for associative memory through the incorporation of memory vectors. Memory vectors can be slightly used, and this would spark the retrieval of the most similar vector in the network. However, we will find out that due to this process, intrusions can occur. In associative memory for the Hopfield network, there are two types of operations: auto-association and hetero-association. The first being when a vector is associated with itself, and the latter being when two different vectors are associated in storage. Furthermore, both types of operations are possible to store within a single memory matrix, but only if that given representation matrix is not one or the other of the operations, but rather the combination (auto-associative and hetero-associative) of the two.

Hopfield&#x27;s network model utilizes the same learning rule as Hebb&#x27;s (1949) learning rule, which characterised learning as being a result of the strengthening of the weights in cases of neuronal activity.

Rizzuto and Kahana (2001) were able to show that the neural network model can account for repetition on recall accuracy by incorporating a probabilistic-learning algorithm. During the retrieval process, no learning occurs. As a result, the weights of the network remain fixed, showing that the model is able to switch from a learning stage to a recall stage. By adding contextual drift they were able to show the rapid forgetting that occurs in a Hopfield model during a cued-recall task. The entire network contributes to the change in the activation of any single node.

McCulloch and Pitts&#x27; (1943) dynamical rule, which describes the behavior of neurons, does so in a way that shows how the activations of multiple neurons map onto the activation of a new neuron&#x27;s firing rate, and how the weights of the neurons strengthen the synaptic connections between the new activated neuron (and those that activated it). Hopfield would use McCulloch–Pitts&#x27;s dynamical rule in order to show how retrieval is possible in the Hopfield network. However, Hopfield would do so in a repetitious fashion. Hopfield would use a nonlinear activation function, instead of using a linear function. This would therefore create the Hopfield dynamical rule and with this, Hopfield was able to show that with the nonlinear activation function, the dynamical rule will always modify the values of the state vector in the direction of one of the stored patterns.

== Dense associative memory or modern Hopfield network ==

Hopfield networks are recurrent neural networks with dynamical trajectories converging to fixed point attractor states and described by an energy function. The state of each model neuron formula_60 is defined by a time-dependent variable formula_61, which can be chosen to be either discrete or continuous. A complete model describes the mathematics of how the future state of activity of each neuron depends on the known present or previous activity of all the neurons.

In the original Hopfield model of associative memory, the variables were binary, and the dynamics were described by a one-at-a-time update of the state of the neurons. An energy function quadratic in the formula_61 was defined, and the dynamics consisted of changing the activity of each single neuron formula_63 only if doing so would lower the total energy of the system. This same idea was extended to the case of formula_61 being a continuous variable representing the output of neuron formula_63, and formula_61 being a monotonic function of an input current. The dynamics became expressed as a set of first-order differential equations for which the &quot;energy&quot; of the system always decreased.  The energy in the continuous case has one term which is quadratic in the formula_61 (as in the binary model), and a second term which depends on the gain function (neuron&#x27;s activation function). While having many desirable properties of associative memory, both of these classical systems suffer from a small memory storage capacity, which scales linearly with the number of input features. In contrast, by increasing the number of parameters in the model so that there are not just pair-wise but also higher-order interactions between the neurons, one can increase the memory storage capacity.

Dense Associative Memories (also known as the modern Hopfield networks) are generalizations of the classical Hopfield Networks that break the linear scaling relationship between the number of input features and the number of stored memories. This is achieved by introducing stronger non-linearities (either in the energy function or neurons&#x27; activation functions) leading to super-linear (even an exponential) memory storage capacity as a function of the number of feature neurons, in effect increasing the order of interactions between the neurons. The network still requires a sufficient number of hidden neurons.

The key theoretical idea behind dense associative memory networks is to use an energy function and an update rule that is more sharply peaked around the stored memories in the space of neuron&#x27;s configurations compared to the classical model, as demonstrated when the higher-order interactions and subsequent energy landscapes are explicitly modelled.

=== Discrete variables ===
A simple example of the modern Hopfield network can be written in terms of binary variables formula_61 that represent the active formula_69 and inactive formula_70 state of the model neuron formula_63.formula_72In this formula the weights formula_73 represent the matrix of memory vectors (index formula_74 enumerates different memories, and index formula_75 enumerates the content of each memory corresponding to the formula_63-th feature neuron), and the function formula_77 is a rapidly growing non-linear function. The update rule for individual neurons (in the asynchronous case) can be written in the following form formula_78which states that in order to calculate the updated state of the formula_79-th neuron the network compares two energies: the energy of the network with the formula_63-th neuron in the ON state and the energy of the network with the formula_63-th neuron in the OFF state, given the states of the remaining neuron. The updated state of the formula_63-th neuron selects the state that has the lowest of the two energies.

In the limiting case when the non-linear energy function is quadratic formula_83 these equations reduce to the familiar energy function and the update rule for the classical binary Hopfield Network.

The memory storage capacity of these networks can be calculated for random binary patterns. For the power energy function formula_84 the maximal number of memories that can be stored and retrieved from this network without errors is given byformula_85For an exponential energy function formula_86 the memory storage capacity is exponential in the number of feature neuronsformula_87
=== Continuous variables ===
Modern Hopfield networks or dense associative memories can be best understood in continuous variables and continuous time. Consider the network architecture, shown in Fig.1, and the equations for neuron&#x27;s states evolutionwhere the currents of the feature neurons are denoted by formula_88, and the currents of the memory neurons are denoted by formula_89 (formula_90 stands for hidden neurons). There are no synaptic connections among the feature neurons or the memory neurons. A matrix formula_91 denotes the strength of synapses from a feature neuron formula_63 to the memory neuron formula_50. The synapses are assumed to be symmetric, so that the same value characterizes a different physical synapse from the memory neuron formula_50 to the feature neuron formula_63. The outputs of the memory neurons and the feature neurons are denoted by formula_96 and formula_97, which are non-linear functions of the corresponding currents. In general these outputs can depend on the currents of all the neurons in that layer so that formula_98 and formula_99. It is convenient to define these activation functions as derivatives of the Lagrangian functions for the two groups of neuronsThis way the specific form of the equations for neuron&#x27;s states is completely defined once the Lagrangian functions are specified. Finally, the time constants for the two groups of neurons are denoted by formula_100 and formula_101, formula_102 is the input current to the network that can be driven by the presented data.  

General systems of non-linear differential equations can have many complicated behaviors that can depend on the choice of the non-linearities and the initial conditions. For Hopfield Networks, however, this is not the case - the dynamical trajectories always converge to a fixed point attractor state. This property is achieved because these equations are specifically engineered so that they have an underlying energy function The terms grouped into square brackets represent a Legendre transform of the Lagrangian function with respect to the states of the neurons. If the Hessian matrices of the Lagrangian functions are positive semi-definite, the energy function is guaranteed to decrease on the dynamical trajectory This property makes it possible to prove that the system of dynamical equations describing temporal evolution of neurons&#x27; activities will eventually reach a fixed point attractor state.

In certain situations one can assume that the dynamics of hidden neurons equilibrates at a much faster time scale compared to the feature neurons, formula_103. In this case the steady state solution of the second equation in the system () can be used to express the currents of the hidden units through the outputs of the feature neurons. This makes it possible to reduce the general theory () to an effective theory for feature neurons only. The resulting effective update rules and the energies for various common choices of the Lagrangian functions are shown in Fig.2. In the case of log-sum-exponential Lagrangian function the update rule (if applied once) for the states of the feature neurons is the attention mechanism commonly used in many modern AI systems (see Ref. for the derivation of this result from the continuous time formulation).

=== Relationship to classical Hopfield network with continuous variables ===
Classical formulation of continuous Hopfield Networks can be understood as a special limiting case of the modern Hopfield networks with one hidden layer. Continuous Hopfield Networks for neurons with graded response are typically described by the dynamical equations and the energy function where formula_104, and formula_105 is the inverse of the activation function formula_106. This model is a special limit of the class of models that is called models A, with the following choice of the Lagrangian functions that, according to the definition (), leads to the activation functions If we integrate out the hidden neurons the system of equations () reduces to the equations on the feature neurons () with formula_107, and the general expression for the energy () reduces to the effective energy While the first two terms in equation () are the same as those in equation (), the third terms look superficially different. In equation () it is a Legendre transform of the Lagrangian for the feature neurons, while in () the third term is an integral of the inverse activation function. Nevertheless, these two expressions are in fact equivalent, since the derivatives of a function and its Legendre transform are inverse functions of each other. The easiest way to see that these two terms are equal explicitly is to differentiate each one with respect to formula_108. The results of these differentiations for both expressions are equal to formula_109. Thus, the two expressions are equal up to an additive constant. This completes the proof that the classical Hopfield Network with continuous states is a special limiting case of the modern Hopfield network () with energy ().

=== General formulation of the modern Hopfield network ===

Biological neural networks have a large degree of heterogeneity in terms of different cell types. This section describes a mathematical model of a fully connected modern Hopfield network assuming the extreme degree of heterogeneity: every single neuron is different. Specifically, an energy function and the corresponding dynamical equations are described assuming that each neuron has its own activation function and kinetic time scale.  The network is assumed to be fully connected, so that every neuron is connected to every other neuron using a symmetric matrix of weights formula_110, indices formula_111 and formula_112 enumerate different neurons in the network, see Fig.3. The easiest way to mathematically formulate this problem is to define the architecture through a Lagrangian function formula_113 that depends on the activities of all the neurons in the network. The activation function for each neuron is defined as a partial derivative of the Lagrangian  with respect to that neuron&#x27;s activity From the biological perspective one can think about formula_114 as an axonal output of the neuron formula_111. In the simplest case, when the Lagrangian is additive for different neurons, this definition results in the activation that is a non-linear function of that neuron&#x27;s activity. For non-additive Lagrangians this activation function can depend on the activities of a group of neurons. For instance, it can contain contrastive (softmax) or divisive normalization. The dynamical equations describing temporal evolution of a given neuron are given by This equation belongs to the class of models called firing rate models in neuroscience. Each neuron formula_111 collects the axonal outputs formula_117 from all the neurons, weights them with the synaptic coefficients formula_110 and produces its own time-dependent activity formula_119. The temporal evolution has a time constant formula_120, which in general can be different for every neuron. This network has a global energy function where the first two terms represent the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian function with respect to the neurons&#x27; currents formula_119. The temporal derivative of this energy function can be computed on the dynamical trajectories leading to (see for details) The last inequality sign holds provided that the matrix formula_122 (or its symmetric part) is positive semi-definite. If, in addition to this, the energy function is bounded from below the non-linear dynamical equations are guaranteed to converge to a fixed point attractor state. The advantage of formulating this network in terms of the Lagrangian functions is that it makes it possible to easily experiment with different choices of the activation functions and different architectural arrangements of neurons. For all those flexible choices the conditions of convergence are determined by the properties of the matrix formula_123 and the existence of the lower bound on the energy function.
=== Hierarchical associative memory network ===
The neurons can be organized in layers so that every neuron in a given layer has the same activation function and the same dynamic time scale. If we assume that there are no horizontal connections between the neurons within the layer (lateral connections) and there are no skip-layer connections, the general fully connected network (), () reduces to the architecture shown in Fig.4. It has formula_124 layers of recurrently connected neurons with the states described by continuous variables formula_125 and the activation functions formula_126, index formula_127 enumerates the layers of the network, and index formula_63 enumerates individual neurons in that layer. The activation functions can depend on the activities of all the neurons in the layer. Every layer can have a different number of neurons formula_129. These neurons are recurrently connected with the neurons in the preceding and the subsequent layers. The matrices of weights that connect neurons in layers formula_127 and formula_131 are denoted by formula_132 (the order of the upper indices for weights is the same as the order of the lower indices, in the example above this means that the index formula_63 enumerates neurons in the layer formula_127, and index formula_135 enumerates neurons in the layer formula_131). The feedforward weights and the feedback weights are equal. The dynamical equations for the neurons&#x27; states can be written as \xi^{(A, A-1)}_{ij} g_j^{A-1} + \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_{A+1}} \xi^{(A, A+1)}_{ij} g_j^{A+1} - x_i^A&lt;/math&gt;|14}} with boundary conditions The main difference between these equations and those from the conventional feedforward networks is the presence of the second term, which is responsible for the feedback from higher layers. These top-down signals help neurons in lower layers to decide on their response to the presented stimuli. Following the general recipe it is convenient to introduce a Lagrangian function formula_137 for the formula_127-th hidden layer, which depends on the activities of all the neurons in that layer. The activation functions in that layer can be defined as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian With these definitions the energy (Lyapunov) function is given by \Big[ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_A} x_i^A g_i^A - L^{A}\Big] - \sum\limits_{A=1}^{N_\text{layer}-1} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{A+1}} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N_A} g_i^{A+1} \xi^{(A+1,A)}_{ij} g_j^A&lt;/math&gt;|17}} If the Lagrangian functions, or equivalently the activation functions, are chosen in such a way that the Hessians for each layer are positive semi-definite and the overall energy is bounded from below, this system is guaranteed to converge to a fixed point attractor state. The temporal derivative of this energy function is given by \tau_A \sum\limits_{i,j=1}^{N_A} \frac{dx_j^A}{dt} \frac{\partial^2 L^{A}}{\partial x_j^{A} \partial x_i^{A}} \frac{dx_i^A}{dt} \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;|18}} Thus, the hierarchical layered network is indeed an attractor network with the global energy function. This network is described by a hierarchical set of synaptic weights that can be learned for each specific problem.

<text>Holybrook is a civil parish, forming a contiguous part of Reading in West Berkshire and is a mixture of urban, suburban land with watercourses and flood meadows in Berkshire, England. The parish takes its name from the Holy Brook, a watercourse which forms its southern boundary and which is a corollary of the River Kennet. Its main settlements are part of Calcot those commonly known as Beansheaf Farm and Fords Farm, Holybrook and occasionally considered part of Calcot or Southcote which overlaps with this area.

==Geography and history==
Historically, since before the Norman Conquest, this was part of the parish of Reading, when its Southcot or Southcote part was a well-dispersed settlement. Holybrook is composed of two suburbs of Reading: Beansheaf Farm and Fords Farm, together with that part of the older suburb of Calcot that lies south of the A4 Bath Road. The church of St Michael in this area was built in 1967, one of only a small minority built to serve a new parish in that decade.

The civil parish dates from 2000 when it was created from the part of Theale east of the M4 motorway.

==Demography==
==Governance==
The parish has an elected parish council, and falls within the area of the unitary authority of West Berkshire. The parish council and the unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government. The parish is in Reading West parliamentary constituency.

<text>Caradog ap Meirion reigned c. 754 – c. 798, died c. 798, was a king of Gwynedd in North West Wales. This Welsh name means Caradog son of Meirion.

This era in the history of Kingdom of Gwynedd was not notable and, given the lack of reliable information available, serious histories such that as by John Davies do not mention Caradog, or (like that of John Edward Lloyd) mention his name only in a footnote quoting the year of his death in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;.

It is assumed Caradog rose to the throne upon the death of King Rhodri Molwynog, which Phillimore&#x27;s reconstruction of the &quot;Annals of Wales&quot; dates to 754. However, there is no other basis for the date and, as the records are quite sparse in this era, intervening kings cannot be precluded. The sole references to Caradog in the historical record are the appearance of his name in genealogies such as those in Jesus College MS. 20, and the entry of his death in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; (Phillimore&#x27;s year 798),) noting he was killed ( &quot;throat-slit&quot;) by the Anglo-Saxons (probably the Mercians).

It was during Caradog&#x27;s reign that the Welsh church adopted the Catholic method of calculating Easter through the efforts of Bishop Elfodd in 768, thus removing a longstanding point of ecclesiastical contention. In 796, a battle occurred at Rhuddlan Marsh () but neither the combatants nor the outcome is given. According to &quot;Brut Aberpergwm&quot;, a purported medieval Welsh text which was accepted as such by the editors of the &quot;Myvyrian Archaiology&quot; (but which is now known to a forgery of Iolo Morganwg&#x27;s), Caradog was slain in the 796 battle. Thomas Stephens was the first to doubt the text&#x27;s authenticity.

The pedigree in Jesus College MS. 20 states that the later King Hywel (reigned c. 816 – c. 825) was Caradog&#x27;s son, while historical works such as that by Lloyd say that Hywel was the son of Caradog&#x27;s predecessor and the brother of his successor, King Cynan (reigned c. 798 – c. 816). Lloyd does not cite his sources for this assertion.

<doc id="1170107" wikidata="Q3493471" url="?curid=1170107" title="Spike (Elvis Costello album)">
<text>Spike is the 12th studio album by English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, released in 1989 by Warner Bros. Records. It was his first album for the label and first release since &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; with no appearance by the Attractions. It peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and also reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 32, thanks to the single and his most notable American hit, &quot;Veronica&quot;, which reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 on the US Modern Rock chart. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Spike&quot; finished at No. 7.

==Content==
In 1987, Costello began writing with Paul McCartney for the latter&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; album. They composed a dozen songs together, which showed up on multiple albums by McCartney and Costello. Two of those songs appear on this album, &quot;Pads, Paws and Claws&quot; and the hit single &quot;Veronica&quot;.

As his first album for a new label, in his own words Costello had the budget of &quot;a small independent movie&quot;, and having in mind the blueprint for five albums, decided to make all of them. He brought back his foil from &quot;King of America&quot;, T-Bone Burnett, to facilitate the sessions and produce the album. Studio time was booked in four locations: Ocean Way in Hollywood; Southlake Studios in New Orleans; Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin; and AIR Studios in London. Four different groups of musicians were assembled in each location. Writing credits on the album are given to both Elvis Costello and Declan MacManus, Costello&#x27;s birth name.

The single &quot;Veronica&quot; peaked at No. 31 on the UK singles chart and at No. 19 in America, his best showing ever on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also reached No. 1 on the US Modern Rock chart. &quot;This Town&quot; was also released as a single but missed both of the main singles chart in both nations. An extended play single was also released for &quot;Baby Plays Around&quot;, peaking at No. 65 in the UK.

The second track, &quot;Let Him Dangle&quot;, is a protest song opposing capital punishment, recounting the 1953 conviction and execution of Derek Bentley.

The seventh track, &quot;Tramp the Dirt Down&quot;, is a fiery lament, depicting Costello&#x27;s anger at the Thatcher government and its effect on Britain&#x27;s society. In the song, Costello expresses his desire to live long enough to see Margaret Thatcher die and vows, &quot;I&#x27;ll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down.&quot; &quot;I wish I&#x27;d written &#x27;Tramp the Dirt Down&#x27;,&quot; said singer Natalie Merchant. The song reached No. 79 on the iTunes chart following Thatcher&#x27;s death in April 2013. In addition, he played this song at Glastonbury 2013 having previously performed it there on the Pyramid Stage in 1987.

Lyrics are given in the booklet for the eighth track, &quot;Stalin Malone&quot;, but the album recording is an instrumental and does not include vocals. A version with a recitation of the lyrics as poetry appears on the 2001 bonus disc.

==Artwork==
The album cover was designed by Jeri and John Heiden. Costello described the image to the BBC in 1989: &quot;I had this image of the beloved entertainer in captivity, as we see him now hung up on the wall. That&#x27;s kind of what the record companies do now; they go out and shoot their artists and hang them up like a trophy in the boardroom.&quot;

==Release history==
The album was released initially on compact disc in 1989. As part of the Rhino Records reissue campaign for Costello&#x27;s back catalogue from Demon/Columbia and Warners, it was re-released in 2001 with 17 additional tracks on a bonus disc. The bonus disc included three tracks with Nick Lowe on bass and Attractions drummer Pete Thomas for use as b-sides, recorded at Wessex Sound Studios after the &quot;Spike&quot; mixing sessions.

<text>Castlemaine Perkins is a brewery at 185 Milton Road, Milton, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is a wholly owned entity of the Japanese-controlled Lion company. Operations began in 1878 and continue today. Castlemaine Perkins is the home of the XXXX beer brand.

==History==

In 1877, brothers Nicholas Fitzgerald and Edward Fitzgerald partnered with a Brisbane commercial firm to buy the site of a failing distillery and establish a brewery, named for the Fitzgeralds&#x27; existing Castlemaine Brewery. They began to brew beer there in the following year and the brewery continues production to this day. The first beverage was called XXX Sparkling Ale.

In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872.

The company restricted its operations entirely to brewing by 1916. XXXX was introduced with new advertising campaign in 1924 after the brewery employed German brewer, Alhois William Leitner. The advertising included a depiction of a little man wearing a suit with a smile, a wink and a boater hat. The so-called &#x27;Fourex Man&#x27; soon became one of the most recognised symbols in Queensland.

In 1928 (long after the death of Patrick Perkins in 1901), the Perkins brewing company was bought by the Castlemaine Brewery with new company being known as Castlemaine Perkins Limited.

In March 1980, Castlemaine Perkins merged with Tooheys to form Castlemaine Tooheys. Bond Corporation purchased Castlemaine Tooheys in 1985. Castlemaine Tooheys was acquired in 1992 by Lion Nathan.

==Building==
The large, brick brewery is located on Milton Road opposite the Milton railway station, and is a prominent landmark visible in the surrounding suburbs. In particular the XXXX red neon sign is mounted on the top of the building. The side of the building also a neon XXXX man on the side (visible on Milton Road when travelling out of the city).

The brewery building, Milton Railway Station and trains feature on almost all XXXX packaging directly below the XXXX logo. Over the years bottle labels have depicted steam, diesel and electric trains. Tours of the brewery are regularly run for groups.

== Awards ==
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the XXXX Brewery was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;structure and engineering feat&quot;.

Castlemaine Perkins was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2009, for its significant contribution to economic development in Queensland.

==Beverages==
Castlemaine&#x27;s signature beer, &quot;XXXX Bitter&quot; (despite its name a lager), was introduced in 1924. The XXXX had been used for a sparkling ale since 1878.&lt;br&gt;
XXXX Gold is a mid-strength beer.

&quot;XXXX Summer Bright Lager&quot; is a 4.2% abv low carb pale lager.

<text>The Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, also the Action in the Helgoland Bight and the , was an inconclusive naval engagement fought between British and German squadrons on 17 November 1917 during the First World War.

==Background==

===British minelaying===

The British used sea mining defensively to protect sea lanes and trade routes and offensively to impede the transit of German submarines and surface ships in the North Sea, the danger of which was illustrated on 17 October 1917 by the sortie of the German &quot;Brummer&quot;-class cruisers and (the action off Lerwick) against the Scandinavian Convoy. (During 1917, six U-boats were sunk by British mines and in two years, the German minesweeping counter-effort suffered the loss about 28 destroyers and 70 minesweepers and other ships.)

The Germans had been forced into minesweeping up to into the Heligoland Bight and in the southern Baltic Sea, covered by light cruisers and destroyers, with occasional distant support by battleships. After the action off Lerwick, several proposals for attacks on the German minesweepers and escorts were canvassed at the Admiralty. On 31 October, the British sent a large force of cruisers and destroyers into the Kattegat, which sank , an armed merchant ship and nine trawlers.

===German test trips===

The prolific British laying of mines and net barrages outside the main German mine belts between Horns Reef and Terschelling, close to the bases of the High Seas Fleet () forced the into surveying the British minefields, to find routes through them for transit into and back from the North Sea. Test trips were carried out, being substantial operations with ships to find the mines, minesweepers, torpedo boats (usually a continental term for destroyers), U-boats, barrier breakers and light cruisers, with air reconnaissance by Zeppelins and seaplanes. The Test trips were also protected by battleships on routes known to be free of mines.

==Prelude==

===North Sea operations===

On 20 October, the British code breakers of Room 40, part of the Naval Intelligence Division of the Admiralty, decrypted orders to the submarine &quot;UB-61&quot; to scout to the north of Bergen to find the new route of the Scandinavian Convoy. Agent reports from Copenhagen disclosed an imminent German attack by seven light cruisers and 36 destroyers. During the week ending 11 November, British light cruisers, destroyers and a battlecruiser escort, conducted an abortive sweep along the fringe of the Heligoland Bight minefields. By mid-November the Admiralty had obtained enough intelligence to intercept one of the big German minesweeping operations, provided that the ships based at Rosyth, in Scotland, could sail in time. The Admiralty decided that an offensive operation should begin on 17 November.

===Test trip, 17 November===

The Germans planned a Test trip for 17 November 1917, comprising the 2nd and 6th Auxiliary Mine Sweeper Half-Flotillas, the 12th and 14th Torpedo Boat Half-Flotillas, Barrier Breaking Division IV and light cruisers of Scouting Group Division II, commanded by Rear-Admiral () Ludwig von Reuter from the 6th Mine Sweeper Half-Flotilla. The &quot;Kaiser&quot;-class battleships, and from Squadron IV, each with ten guns, led by Captain () Kurt Graßhoff in &quot;Kaiserin&quot;, were to act as covering force for the group. The battleships were to reach a point west of Heligoland by while the Test trip group rendezvoused in the Heligoland Bight about half-way between Horns Reef and Terschelling. With poor weather grounding Zeppelins and making it impossible for light cruisers to embark seaplanes, after they had alighted on the sea, the Test trip relied on reconnaissance patrols by two land-based seaplanes from Borkum on the German coast, just east of the Netherlands, for reconnoitring ahead of the group.

===British plan===

The German Test trip had been revealed by the code breakers of Room 40, allowing the British to plan an ambush. On 16 November, orders for an attack on the Test trip were sent to Admiral Sir David Beatty, Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand Fleet. On 17 November 1917 a force of cruisers under Vice Admiral Trevylyan Napier was sent to attack the German minesweepers as they were minesweeping.

==Battle==
The action began at roughly west of Sylt, when sighted German ships. She opened fire at Reuter advanced with four light cruisers and eight destroyers towards the British ship to cover the withdrawal of the minesweepers, with all but the trawler , escaping the British detachment. A stern chase ensued as the German forces, making skillful use of smokescreens, withdrew south-east at their best speed, under fire from the 1st Cruiser Squadron, the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron and the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron. was detached from the 1st Battle Cruiser Squadron and came up at high speed to join the battle. Both sides were hampered in their manoeuvres by the presence of naval minefields.

At about the same time, the light cruisers came under fire from &quot;Kaiser&quot; and &quot;Kaiserin&quot;, &quot;Kaiser&quot;-class battleships, which had come up in support of Reuter&#x27;s ships; was struck by a shell, which damaged a gun turret; shortly afterwards, the British ships gave up the chase as they reached the edge of more minefields. A shell went through the upper conning tower of the light cruiser , killing the conning tower crew and mortally wounding the Captain, Herbert Edwards, on the bridge and knocking unconscious the navigator, Lieutenant-Commander M. F. F. Wilson. All personnel on the lower bridge were killed and the gunner officer, Lieutenant H. C. C. Clarke took command, which was made more difficult because the shell also cut all electrical communications and reduced the rate of fire. The battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot; briefly engaged the German ships at about achieving a hit on the light cruiser that started a serious fire.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
In 1984, Patrick Beesly wrote that the British operation was daring but that Napier was unjustly blamed for its failure to pursue the German ships with sufficient vigour. Room 40 was well informed about the positions of German minefields and the British fields which the Germans were trying to clear. The information had been added to Room 40&#x27;s naval charts but the information was denied to Napier, who made decisions based on the charts he did have. Admiralty reluctance to disclose that their information was derived from the decoding of wireless intercepts had led to the naval commander&#x27;s being ill-informed. The Admiralty did at least supply operational intelligence to the Naval commanders, after Beatty had made an emergency request when he was at sea. Napier was informed in ninety minutes by the Admiralty that German capital ships had sailed at and the location of German cruisers, leading to &quot;Königsberg&quot;&#x27;s receiving severe damage. At the least, Room 40 had prevented the British operation degenerating from fiasco to disaster.

===Casualties===

In 1920, Admiral Reinhard Scheer wrote that the Germans suffered casualties of killed, ten seriously wounded and thirty men slightly wounded. An Admiralty communiqué listed British casualties as one officer and killed, four officers and wounded; were taken.

===Victoria Cross===
Able Seaman John Carless of Walsall, aboard Commodore Cowan&#x27;s flagship &quot;Caledon&quot;, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery in continuing to load and fire his gun despite receiving mortal shrapnel wounds that opened his abdomen.

<text>Dolores Brooks (born June 20, 1947), also known as Sakinah Muhammad or La La Brooks, is an American singer and actress. She is best known as the second lead singer of the girl group The Crystals and the lead vocalist on the Crystals&#x27; hits &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot; and &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;.

==About==
Brooks was the second youngest of 11 children, born to a Native American mother and an African-American father.

Brooks first displayed her talent by singing gospel music in church. At age seven, she took part in her siblings&#x27; gospel group, Little Gospel Tears, and sang in Brooklyn. While attending PS 73, she was discovered in an after-school program by Dolores &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Kenniebrew and her mother, who invited Brooks to join the Crystals as a replacement for a departing member. She joined the group to replace Merna Girard (who was pregnant) on the March 1962 release &quot;Uptown&quot;.

After leaving the Crystals, she married jazz and session musician Idris Muhammad (born Leo Morris) in 1966; the union brought two sons and two daughters. Shortly thereafter, she converted to Islam with him, changing her name to Sakinah Muhammad. She helped Idris write and record his material over the years. In 1968, she appeared in the original Broadway production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, where she sometimes performed the song &quot;Aquarius&quot;. She later appeared in the Broadway show &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; in 1971. She also toured with, and recorded for, various artists, such as the Neville Brothers, Bobby Womack and Isaac Hayes. She made short appearances in films, and contributed songs to different movie soundtracks (including the 1970 film &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot;). In 1971, she reunited with Kenniebrew, Mary Thomas, and Barbara Alston as the Crystals, and toured and performed in rock-&amp;-roll revival shows. Their touring lasted until 1973, when the members decided to devote their time to their families.

In 1983, she and her family moved to London, England, where she and Idris continued their careers in music. In 1990, they moved to Vienna, Austria, where she continued singing and writing songs with Idris, and also hosted a local radio show. They lived in Vienna until 1997. Andrew Edge sang backing vocals on her BMG (Austria) CD &quot;LaLa Brooks &amp; Friends&quot; in 1994. In 1999, she and Idris divorced.

Brooks moved back to the United States in about 2000 and resides in the East Village, New York.

Brooks, with her musical group, is back performing around the world.

<text>The DuPage River is a tributary of the Des Plaines River in the U.S. state of Illinois.

==Course==
The river begins as two individual streams. The West Branch of the DuPage River, long, starts at Campanelli Park in Schaumburg within Cook County and continues southward through the entire county of DuPage, including the towns of Bartlett, Wayne, Wheaton, Warrenville, Winfield and Naperville (including through its riverwalk), as well as McDowell Grove. The East Branch of the DuPage River, long, begins in Bloomingdale and flows southward through Glendale Heights, Glen Ellyn, Lisle, Woodridge, parts of Naperville and parts of Bolingbrook. St. Joseph Creek, a tributary of the river&#x27;s East Branch, runs through the small town of Belmont. The two branches meet at the southern end of Knoch Knolls Park, between Naperville and Bolingbrook. The combined DuPage River continues southward from that point, through Plainfield &amp; Shorewood and then west of Joliet. Farther downstream, at Channahon, a dam on the river was originally constructed to raise the DuPage River water level to feed the Illinois and Michigan Canal. From Channahon, the river finally meets the Des Plaines River.

==Flooding==
Like many local bodies of water, both branches of the DuPage River seriously overflowed after the &quot;Flood of 1996&quot;, when approximately of rain fell on the area within a 24-hour period, on July 17–18 of that year. Other flooding was also very common, along Washington Street in Naperville and Illinois Route 53 in Glen Ellyn, because those roads are close to their respective branches of the river, and along the river in Plainfield. The City of Naperville has torn down many of the affected homes and businesses, in the former case, and DuPage County, with U.S. Department of Transportation funding, tore down many of the affected homes in the latter case.

==History==

The first written history to address the name, the 1882 &quot;History of DuPage County, Illinois&quot;, relates that:
On the 1825 Henry S. Tanner map of Illinois and Missouri, Du Page River is listed as the &quot;Du Page or Saukeyuck River&quot;.

<text>Who&#x27;s Who is a reference work. It has been published annually in the form of a hardback book since 1849, and has been published online since 1999. It has also been published on CD-ROM. It lists, and gives information on, people from around the world who influence British life. Entries include notable figures from government, politics, academia, business, sport and the arts. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2023&quot; is the 175th edition and includes more than 33,000 people.

In 2004, the book was described as the United Kingdom&#x27;s most prominent work of biographical reference.

The book is the original &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; book and &quot;the pioneer work of its type&quot;. The book is an origin of the expression &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; used in a wider sense.

==History==
&quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; has been published since 1849.

When book publisher A &amp; C Black bought the copyright to the publication in 1896, Douglas Sladen was employed with a three-year contract to overhaul the publication. According to Sladen, the old &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was solely a &quot;handbook of the titled and official classes only&quot;, which he sought to modernize by including celebrities from all circles through the use of autobiographical forms. Between 1897 and 1899, under Sladen, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; expanded its number of entries from 6,000 to 8,500. The inclusion of a &quot;recreations&quot; section for biographees to fill proved to be particularly successful for the book: according to Sladen, newspapers &quot;never tired of quoting the recreations of eminent people&quot;, thus attracting publicity for the publication. While Sladen&#x27;s contract was not renewed, the revised &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; experienced financial success: its sales rose from 10,000 to 12,000 copies between 1901 and 1910, in spite of a twofold increase in the book price for that period.

Cedric Arthur Larson stated that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in 1849&quot; was not biographical. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; turned into a biographical dictionary in 1897. In 1963 and 1975, Professor William Lawrence Rivers wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; then included biographical information.

In 1973, a spinoff version, called &quot;The Academic Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, was released by the same publisher. Both the first edition, published in 1973, and the second edition, published in 1975, were published by Adam &amp; Charles Black in London. The first US edition was published by Bowker in New York, and the second by Gale Research in Detroit. The second edition contained biographies of almost seven thousand academics.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1897–1996&quot; was published on CD-ROM and was awarded the McColvin Medal. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1897–1998&quot; was also published on CD-ROM. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was included in KnowUK from 1999. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2005&quot; was included in Xreferplus. The &quot;Who&#x27;s Who &amp; Who Was Who&quot; website (ukwhoswho.com) is dated from 2007 onwards. &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; continues to be published annually in hardback.

A history of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was published to coincide with the 150th edition in 1998. &quot;Preface with a Brief History 1849–1998&quot; was included in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1998&quot;.

==Publishers and editors==
&quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was originally published by Baily Brothers. Since 1897, it has been published by A &amp; C Black. It has been published in New York by the Macmillan Company and by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

From 1849 to 1850, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was edited by Henry Robert Addison, from 1851 to 1864 by Charles Henry Oakes, from 1865 by William John Lawson and from 1897 to 1899 by Douglas Sladen. Subsequent editions do not disclose the identity of their editor. In 1990, it was reported that after the departure of Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen, the people who compiled &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; remained anonymous to conceal the fact that they were female. In 2004, it was reported that the editorial staff and the selection panel endeavour to operate in anonymity so as to shield themselves from unwanted pressures.

==Biographies==
Academics who study elites have used the book as the primary reference for deducing who is part of the British elite.

===Inclusiveness===
The subjects of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entries include peers, MPs, judges, senior civil servants, writers, lawyers, scientists, academics, actors, athletes, artists and hereditary aristocrats. 50 percent of new entrants (such as those holding a professorial chair at Oxbridge, baronets, peers, MPs, judges etc.) are included automatically by virtue of their office or title; the other 50 percent are selected at the discretion of a board of advisors. Inclusion has come to carry a considerable level of prestige: Paul Levy stated in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1996 that having an entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; &quot;really puts the stamp of eminence on a modern British life&quot;.

Once someone is included in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; they remain in it for life: MPs, for example, are not removed when they leave Parliament. The 7th Earl of Lucan continued to be listed in the book after he went missing in 1974 and even after he was declared legally dead in 1999. He was listed in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2016&quot;, which was published in 2015. As of 2023, the most recent version of his entry on the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who &amp; Who Was Who&quot; website is dated 1 December 2016, his death certificate having been issued in 2016.

Inclusion in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; does not involve any payment by or to the subject, or even any obligation to buy a copy. Some individuals have attempted to offer bribes in attempts to be included.

The publication includes the members of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, members of the House of Commons, the chief executives of all UK cities and counties, and foreign ambassadors accredited to London. There was a high proportion of Oxford and Cambridge graduates among the new entrants in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2008&quot;. During the reign of Queen Victoria, the proportion of such graduates was less than 20%.

In a review of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1907&quot;, the &quot;Law Magazine and Review&quot; declared: &quot;So comprehensive is the scheme of the work that it is well-nigh impossible to find any person at all entitled to be considered prominent in any particular sphere, whose biography is not included&quot;. &quot;The Expository Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1910&quot; included &quot;Everybody who is anybody&quot;. The &quot;Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects&quot; wrote that the choice of subjects included in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1936&quot; was generally appropriate. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; about a radio documentary on the book they prepared for &quot;BBC Radio 4&quot; in 2004, Crick and Rosenbaum criticised, or reported that others had criticised, the publication for its lack of inclusion of well known celebrities, sports personalities, solicitors, and the quasi-totality of Britain&#x27;s wealthiest people. They also questioned the inclusion of all baronets. In 2007, Jeremy Paxman criticised the publication for failing to include more non-British MEPs. In 2010, Charles Moore criticised the criticism of the inclusiveness of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;. In 2021, it was reported that Michael Grade, who was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC from 2004 to 2006, had criticised &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; for failing to include entries for Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne.

Richard Fitzwilliams, former editor of &quot;The International Who&#x27;s Who&quot; quoted in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2015 indicated that Arthur Scargill and Tony Benn were included in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; against their wishes, and that W. S. Gilbert was &quot;threatened with being given a concocted version of his entry unless he provided one&quot;. Douglas Sladen published or threatened to publish non-autobiographical entries for recalcitrant figures in order to coerce them to submit their own autobiographical forms. In his autobiography, Douglas Sladen wrote: &quot;W. S. Gilbert wrote the rudest letter of anybody. He said he was always being pestered by unimportant people for information about himself. So I put him down in the book as &quot;Writer of Verses and the libretti to Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas.&quot; He then wrote me a letter . . . in which he asked me if that was the way to treat a man who had written seventy original dramas. Next year he filled up his form as readily as a peer&#x27;s widow who has married a commoner.&quot; In a footnote to the preceding passage from Sladen&#x27;s autobiography, the historian Philip Waller said that &quot;Sladen did not always allow accuracy to get in the way of a good story&quot;, and that the actual facts consist of the inclusion of the line &quot;Writer of Verses and the libretti to Sir Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas&quot; in Gilbert&#x27;s biography in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1897&quot; and &quot;1898&quot;, and the removal of that line from Gilbert&#x27;s biography in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1899&quot;, to which no other changes were made. In his autobiography, Sladen wrote: &quot;A prominent authoress first of all refused to fill up her form at all. I wrote to tell her that in that case I should have to fill it up for her. She showed no concern about this until I sent her a proof of the biography, in which I made her out ten years older than she really was, and said that I meant to insert the biography in that form unless there was anything she wished to correct. She then corrected it, and added so much that it would have taken the whole column if I had inserted all she sent.&quot; According to Philip Waller, this &quot;was how Sladen behaved: if celebrities did not deliver, he invented a CV for them. It usually brought them into line.&quot; In 2004, it was reported that Scargill had argued that people who do not wish to be in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; should be allowed to opt out.

===Compilation and authorship===
From 1897 onwards, entries have been compiled from questionnaires filled in by their subjects and then returned to the publisher. Lea and Day wrote that this approach normally leads to increased accuracy.

It has been said that, from &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1897&quot; onwards, the entries, or the majority of them, are autobiographical. &quot;Nature Notes&quot; described the notices of naturalists in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1900&quot; as &quot;virtually autobiographical&quot;.

In A &amp; C Black Ltd v Claude Stacey Ltd, Justice Tomlin, sitting in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in England, held that the &quot;author&quot;, within the meaning of that expression in section 5 of the Copyright Act 1911, of each biography in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was the compiler. This decision has been cited as authority as to the meaning of the expression &quot;author&quot; in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

===Content===
Entries typically include full names, dates of birth, career details, club memberships, education, professional qualifications, publications, recreations and contact details.

===Utility===
&quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; has been repeatedly described as useful and indispensable.

===Reliability and accuracy===
&quot;The Saturday Review&quot; wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1904&quot; is &quot;generally accurate&quot;. &quot;The World&#x27;s Paper Trade Review&quot; wrote that &quot;it may be relied on not only as being accurate but really authoritative&quot;. &quot;The Law Magazine and Review&quot; wrote that &quot;The accuracy of the information given shows the great care with which this work has been compiled&quot;. &quot;The Law Journal&quot; wrote that the &quot;biographical details of judges and leading members of the profession . . . so far as we have tested them, are . . . accurate&quot;.

&quot;The Congregationalist and Christian World&quot; wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1907&quot; &quot;comes promptly to aid journalists and others who wish to consult . . . accurate biographies of the leading personages in the Western political and literary world, Britons of course predominating.&quot; &quot;The Standard&quot; called it &quot;a monument of painstaking care&quot;. &quot;Page&#x27;s Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;we have subjected Who&#x27;s Who to several tests and are glad to find that the accuracy which pervades the subject matter is again worthy of high commendation&quot;. &quot;Medical Record&quot; wrote that &quot;The data about Americans mentioned in the work appear to be in the main correct, though we notice that the name of the late Albert Bierstadt, the artist, is retained in the book as though he were still living.&quot; The &quot;United Service Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;Immense pains are taken to ensure accuracy&quot;.

&quot;The Dublin Journal of Medical Science&quot; wrote that the biographies in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1908&quot; &quot;may be considered to be accurate&quot;. &quot;The Electrical Review&quot; wrote that &quot;the details may generally be regarded as accurate&quot;. &quot;Page&#x27;s Weekly&quot; added that &quot;We have many occasions had reason to admire the accuracy which is attained by the Editor of Who&#x27;s Who&quot;.

&quot;Country Life&quot; wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1909&quot; was &quot;of most praiseworthy accuracy&quot;. &quot;The Scots Law Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The information given about the persons named may be taken as reliable&quot;. &quot;The Empire Review and Magazine&quot; wrote &quot;the great pains taken to ensure accuracy gives to the volume additional value&quot;. &quot;The American Review of Reviews&quot; wrote that it &quot;continues . . . to sustain its high level of accuracy&quot;.

&quot;Knowledge &amp; Scientific News&quot; wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1910&quot; &quot;is kept up-to-date and accurate&quot;. &quot;The Railway News&quot; wrote that &quot;The information is brought thoroughly up to date&quot;. &quot;Country Life&quot; wrote that &quot;This year it appears to be as accurate . . . as usual.&quot; &quot;Page&#x27;s Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s Who has a notable reputation to maintain and it is not surprising to find, therefore, that exceptional care is taken to render it a reference work of unimpeachable accuracy.&quot;

In 2001, &quot;BBC News&quot; qualified some of the entrants as &quot;a little economical with the truth&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; about a radio documentary on the book they prepared for &quot;BBC Radio 4&quot; in 2004, Michael Crick and Martin Rosenbaum wrote that there were questions about the accuracy of the entries, but that they frequently used &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; themselves in their work as journalists. In 2007, the reliability of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Online&quot; was praised by William Ashford Kelly. In 2014, the reliability of the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who &amp; Who Was Who&quot; website was praised by Fred Burchsted.

Subjects are not permitted to include libellous statements in their entries. In 2004, the publishing director for reference books of Bloomsbury, which owns A &amp; C Black, the publisher of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who,&quot; stated that if an inaccuracy was brought to the attention of the editors, they would raise it with the biographee first. If the biographee insisted or failed to respond, however, no correction would be issued. The director stated that &quot;the vast majority of errors&quot; are sorted by mutual agreement between &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; and the biographee.

====Dates of birth====
In 2004, Crick and Rosenbaum wrote that the largest number of errors were in dates of birth. It has been reported that entries for 
Mohamed al-Fayed, Anita Brookner, Ken Dodd, Susan Hampshire, Nanette Newman, and Nicholas Parsons have displayed incorrect dates of birth. The BBC claimed that when Brookner was asked by the editors of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; whether she wanted her date of birth corrected, she asked to have it blanked instead. Errors in the dates of birth of Mohamed al-Fayed, Ken Dodd and Susan Hampshire had previously been reported by Compton Miller, editor of &quot;Who&#x27;s Really Who&quot;, in a book review of A &amp; C Black&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1998&quot;, in which Compton Miller praised the entries for Mohamed al-Fayed, Ken Dodd and Susan Hampshire in his own book. It has been reported that the entry for Jimmy Wray has displayed a disputed date of birth.

====Particular entries====
In 2001, &quot;BBC News&quot; claimed that former MP Jeffrey Archer had listed Brasenose College, Oxford, under the education part of his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry, despite having no degree and having only attended a one-year postgraduate physical education course. Previously, in a 1997 letter to the editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, Paul Flather of Oxford University had written that the training course Archer had taken at Brasenose College was &quot;not strictly a university course&quot;, and that his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry also incorrectly listed his year of attendance. In 2004, Crick and Rosenbaum claimed that the entry for Archer had also listed an incorrect sum of money.

The entry for Iain Duncan Smith in (in particular) &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2002&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2003&quot; claimed that he had been educated at &quot;Univ. di Perugia&quot;. This claim did not appear in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 2004&quot;. In 2002, BBC Newsnight reported that Duncan Smith had attended the Università per Stranieri di Perugia and had never attended the Università degli Studi di Perugia.

The entry for James Gulliver in (in particular) &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1972&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1973&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1980&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1985&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1986&quot;, stated that he had been educated at Harvard University and did not mention that he had been educated at, and had received an MSc from, the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1954. The press repeatedly reported that Gulliver had received an MBA from Harvard Business School. Those press reports were not correct. He had in fact done a marketing course at Harvard Business School for three weeks in 1954. On 9 March 1986, Gulliver said that his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry was not correct in relation &quot;to a degree achieved in 1954&quot;. The press had been informed of the error by a PR company working for an alcohol company that Gulliver&#x27;s company had bid to takeover. Paddy Ashdown said that the PR company had performed &quot;a rather unsavoury and tawdry&quot; character &quot;assassination&quot;. The bald statement that Gulliver was educated at the Harvard University has been characterized as having a tendency to mislead.

In 2004, Crick and Rosenbaum reported that Arthur Scargill had denied that his entry was completely accurate.

===Omissions===
In 2004, Crick and Rosenbaum named six people whose entries were claimed to have contained at least one omission at some point in time (excluding entries claimed to have displayed at least one error at some point in time).

Jeremy Paxman has calculated that only 8% of new entrants in 2008 made any reference to marital breakdown, which is far below the national average.

The non-autobiographical entry for W. S. Gilbert in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1897&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1898&quot; did not include the fact that Gilbert had written seventy original dramas.

==Lists and tables==
The original nucleus of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; consisted of tables. In a review of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who 1903&quot;, the &quot;Surveyor and Municipal and County Engineer&quot; wrote &quot;From time to time it has been found necessary to remove some useful tables inserted in the front of the book, in order to make room for the biographies, and now the portentous increase of the latter has led to the complete removal of the tables, with the exception, of course, of those devoted to the Royal Family and to obituaries. The publishers hope . . . to issue the various tables separately . . . at a later date.&quot; The tables were moved into the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Year Book&quot; from the first edition of that year book, the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Year Book, 1904&quot;, onwards.

==&quot;Who Was Who&quot;==
When the subject of a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry dies, the biography is transferred to the next volume of &quot;Who Was Who&quot;, where it is usually printed as it appeared in its last &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, with the date of death added.

The first volume of &quot;Who Was Who&quot; covered deaths between 1897 and 1915. They were then published at 10-year intervals, and since 1990 at five-year intervals.

<doc id="1170144" wikidata="Q3453475" url="?curid=1170144" title="Russell Hoult">
<text>Russell Hoult (born 22 November 1972) is an English football coach and former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He notably spent time playing in the Premier League and played for Leicester City, Derby County and West Bromwich Albion. He also played in the Football League for Lincoln City, Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers, Portsmouth, Nottingham Forest, Stoke City, Notts County, Darlington and Hereford United.

Following the end of his playing career, Hoult moved into coaching and has worked for Hereford United as a goalkeeping coach, before a spell as club president and manager of Thringstone Miners Welfare.

==Playing career==
Hoult began his career at Leicester City, where he was usually a reserve. During his time at the club he was sent on loan to Lincoln City twice, Kettering Town, Blackpool, where he did not make a first team appearance, Cheltenham Town, when they were playing non-league football, and Bolton Wanderers.

He signed for Derby County in the summer of 1995, joining for a fee of £200,000. He went on to help them win promotion to the Premiership in 1996. Hoult remained with the club until January 2000, when he was loaned to Portsmouth. This transfer was made permanent two months later and he remained with the club until the following January, when he left to join West Bromwich Albion for £450,000.

Hoult played a key role in helping West Brom win promotion to the Premiership in 2001–02, keeping a club record number of clean sheets and being named in the PFA Division One team of the year. On 15 September 2001, in a game against Watford, he saved a last minute Marcus Gayle penalty to preserve West Brom&#x27;s 2–1 lead. He was a regular for Albion in the Premiership and was watched by England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, but never made it into the national squad. A highlight of Hoult&#x27;s 2002–03 season was saving a Dion Dublin penalty to help his side secure a 0–0 draw away at Aston Villa. Following Albion&#x27;s relegation, Hoult remained a fixture in the side for the following season, as the club were promoted to the Premiership at the first attempt. In 2004, he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations. He played for the majority of the 2004–05 season, as West Bromwich Albion escaped relegation. However, after being a regular in goal for West Brom for several seasons, Hoult lost his place at the start of the 2005–06 season due to a groin injury. Second choice to Chris Kirkland, who manager Bryan Robson had signed on a 12-month loan from Liverpool, Hoult was loaned to Nottingham Forest in September 2005. However, he was recalled during his second month with the club after Kirkland sustained a rib injury.

Following the club&#x27;s relegation and Kirkland&#x27;s return to Liverpool, goalkeeping duties for the 2006–07 season were shared between Hoult and new signing Pascal Zuberbühler, until reports about his personal life surfaced in national newspapers. On 31 January 2007, after making 190 appearances for the club, Hoult was transferred to Stoke City on a free transfer after being sacked by West Brom. He made his Stoke City debut on 14 August 2007 in a League Cup match away at Rochdale that finished 2–2 after extra time. He was unable to prevent Rochdale from progressing 4–2 on penalties, despite saving one of the spot-kicks. Hoult received a red card on his league debut for Stoke, in a match against Plymouth Argyle in December 2007.

In February 2008 Hoult joined Notts County on loan until the end of the season, following an injury to regular keeper Kevin Pilkington. He kept a clean sheet in the 0–0 draw away at Peterborough United in March, making the League Two Team of the Week. He made 14 appearances for the club, keeping seven clean sheets and helping the club to avoid relegation. He was released at the end of the 2007–08 season, following Stoke&#x27;s promotion to the Premiership. On 1 July 2008, Hoult returned to Notts County on a permanent basis, signing a two-year contract with the club. He played the first three games of the 2009–10 season for Notts County, before being replaced by new signing Kasper Schmeichel for the home game against Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. On 16 September 2009, Darlington manager Colin Todd signed Hoult on loan for a month as Todd felt that permanent Quakers keeper David Knight needed a break after a tough start to the season. Todd was sacked during Hoult&#x27;s loan and he was recalled by Notts County at the end of his month spell. He had played five games for Darlington. On 10 May 2010, it was announced that he had been released by Notts County along with seven other players.

==Coaching career==
Hoult signed on as goalkeeping coach at Hereford United on Thursday 26 August. In October 2010 he became assistant manager to Jamie Pitman after the sacking of Simon Davey. On 25 February 2011, he registered as a player for Hereford United in order to provide goalkeeping back up.
 In March 2012, Hoult signed for Thringstone Miners Welfare as both player/manager and club president. 

==Personal life==
Hoult, a married man, has on a number of occasions been the subject of public revelations concerning his sexual conduct. In 2000, he was fined £300 for kerb crawling. He was also cleared of sending indecent letters to a 15-year-old girl after his lawyer told magistrates that they were no worse than &quot;saucy seaside postcards&quot;. In January 2007 he was suspended by West Bromwich Albion after footage of him involved in an orgy was leaked onto the Internet allegedly with him wearing a club polo shirt.

<doc id="1170153" wikidata="Q1050489" url="?curid=1170153" title="Catch 22 (band)">
<text>Catch 22 is an American ska punk band from East Brunswick Township, New Jersey. 
The band was formed in 1996 by guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Tomas Kalnoky, who left the band in 1998 and later formed Streetlight Manifesto. Founding members remaining in the band are vocalist/saxophonist Ryan Eldred, trumpeter Kevin Gunther, drummer Chris Greer. Original trombonist James Egan returned in 2019.

==Biography==
Catch 22 was formed by guitarist/vocalist Tomas Kalnoky and drummer Chris Greer who recruited trumpeter Kevin Gunther, who was working in a local record store. Bassist Jason Scharenguivel, saxophonist Ryan Eldred, and trombonist James Egan, who was also Kevin Gunther&#x27;s first music teacher, rounded out the original lineup.

The band released a self-produced demo tape, &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;, in 1996. All 2000 copies of the tape quickly sold out. The band mailed several copies to labels they were interested in working with including Gainesville, Florida&#x27;s Toybox Records (who had previously released a 7&quot; by Less Than Jake). Toybox was owned and operated by Sean Bonner, who had recently moved to Chicago, Illinois to work at Victory Records. Sean brought the tape to the Victory office and suggested the band be signed.

Scharenguivel left the band and was replaced by Josh Ansley. The band then signed to Victory and produced their first studio album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Keasbey Nights&quot;. Ansley left and was replaced by Pat Calpin. Kalnoky left the band shortly thereafter, deciding (due in part to parental pressure) to continue his education rather than tour. Catch 22 continued on with Pat Calpin moving to guitar, Pat Kays (nicknamed &quot;Mingus&quot; in the band) on bass, and Jeff Davidson on vocals. After recording the &quot;Washed Up!&quot; EP, Egan left the band to continue his teaching career and focus on family life. &quot;Alone in a Crowd&quot; followed in 2000 with Mike Soprano on trombone. After this release, the band began touring heavily on a national scale, appearing with Mustard Plug, Reel Big Fish, and other third-wave ska, hardcore, and punk acts.
Davidson and Soprano left the band in 2001 to pursue other projects, and for a while the band actively courted new vocalists, even putting an advertisement on their website. Soprano would join Streetlight Manifesto in 2003. The group also recruited Ian McKenzie, formerly of Long Island, New York ska band Edna&#x27;s Goldfish on trombone/vocals.

On February 23, 2002, the band performed at Birch Hill Nightclub in Old Bridge, New Jersey with Gunther as the lead vocalist since Eldred was unavailable at the time. Various members from Last Picked, a fellow ska band from Rahway, NJ, volunteered to fill in the horn section.

After a fruitless search, the band decided to continue on as it was, with Ryan Eldred and Kevin Gunther sharing vocal duties. &quot;Washed Up and Through the Ringer&quot;, an expansion of the &quot;Washed Up!&quot; EP, was released in 2001, featuring two new songs, three rarities from the &quot;Alone in a Crowd&quot; era, and a handful of live tracks recorded in October 2000 at Club Laga in Pittsburgh and Euclid Tavern in Ohio.

The band released its third full-length album, &quot;Dinosaur Sounds&quot;, in 2003, roughly the same time Streetlight Manifesto (a band founded by Tomas Kalnoky and featuring Josh Ansley, Jamie Egan, and Jim Conti as well as former members of the NJ ska band One Cool Guy) released their debut album &quot;Everything Goes Numb&quot;. Both albums featured supposed veiled attacks on each other, suggesting to many fans that there was some sort of disagreement or heat between Catch 22 and Streetlight Manifesto. While there was a disagreement, the two parties have since reconciled their differences. Catch 22&#x27;s Kevin Gunther has since been in charge of Streetlight Manifesto&#x27;s tour booking for many years, and members of both bands have said in conversations with fans that there is no &quot;beef&quot; between the two.

In 2004, Catch 22 released &quot;Live&quot;, a combination CD and DVD recording of a show performed at The Downtown in Farmingdale, New York, earlier that year.

In 2006, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;Permanent Revolution,&quot; a concept album centering on the life of Russian Marxist revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Its title was coined after Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution.

In April 2009, the band embarked on a European tour, which included a performance at the Groezrock festival. They played a few Northeastern US shows in August 2009.

In July 2010, former vocalist Jeff Davidson returned as a guest performer to sing a few songs at one show, making it his first performance with the band since 2001. After a few East Coast shows, the band went on a European tour through to August 2010. Davidson joined the band again to perform &quot;Alone in a Crowd&quot; in full at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, NJ on January 30, 2016.

In February 2012, Catch 22&#x27;s official website showed that they would be making an appearance at Bamboozle 2012. After a hiatus, in February 2015, Catch 22 was listed as a performer for Amnesia Rockfest in Montebello, Quebec. Jamie Egan returned to Catch 22 in 2019, replacing Dave Solomon. Mike Corvasce also replaced Pat Kays.

In November 2022, the band played their 100th show as a band, as part of &quot;Skanksgiving&quot; at Starland Ballroom.

In October 2023, the band confirmed in a Facebook comment that they have been working on material, and will hopefully get something out by 2024.

Near the end of April of 2024, Jamie&#x27;s son Connor starting performing in the band as a touring member.

In February 21, 2025, the band will reunite with former lead vocalist Jeff Davidson once again for the 25th anniversary of their album &quot;Alone in a Crowd&quot; at the Supernova Ska Festival in Fort Monroe, Hampton, Virginia on September 12 to 14, 2025.

==Music==
When Tomas Kalnoky was still the band&#x27;s songwriter, the band had a traditional ska punk sound, and their album &quot;Keasbey Nights&quot; was one of the most recognized third wave ska albums of the time. During this time, Kalnoky was the band&#x27;s primary vocalist, while Kevin Gunther provided most of the backing vocals. &quot;Keasbey Nights&quot; also featured many different instruments not found on later albums, played by Jamie Egan.

After Kalnoky, Egan and Ansley had departed, saxophonist Ryan Eldred became the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, sharing lyric duties with new lead vocalist Jeff Davidson, and Eldred also became the band&#x27;s third vocalist. The band&#x27;s sound changed more towards a punk rock sound, while still retaining the band&#x27;s ska punk roots. The album &quot;Alone in a Crowd&quot; also relied heavily on backing vocals and threeway vocal harmonies provided by Jeff Davidson, Kevin Gunther and Ryan Eldred.

After the departure of Jeff Davidson, both Eldred and Gunther took over lead vocal duties. The older material was distributed evenly between the two, but Eldred was selected as main vocalist for the band&#x27;s new songs. The album &quot;Dinosaur Sounds&quot; saw the band&#x27;s sound depart even more from ska punk, towards alternative rock, which resulted in the alienation of some fans.

2006&#x27;s &quot;Permanent Revolution&quot; saw the band return to its ska punk roots, while also borrowing influences from jazz, reggae and alternative rock. The album was also a concept album, one of the first in the ska punk scene.

<doc id="1170158" wikidata="Q2295075" url="?curid=1170158" title="Ronnie Spector">
<text>Veronica Yvette Greenfield (, formerly Spector; August 10, 1943 – January 12, 2022) was an American singer who co-founded and fronted the girl group the Ronettes. She is sometimes referred to as the original &quot;bad girl of rock and roll&quot;.

Spector formed the singing group the Ronettes with her older sister, Estelle Bennett, and their cousin, Nedra Talley, in the late 1950s. They were signed to Phil Spector&#x27;s Philles label in 1963 and he produced the majority of their recording output. The Ronettes had a string of hits in the 1960s, including &quot;Be My Baby&quot; (1963), &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; (1963), &quot;(The Best Part of) Breakin&#x27; Up&quot; (1964), &quot;Do I Love You?&quot; (1964), and &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; (1964). Ronnie married Phil in 1968. Following the couple&#x27;s divorce in 1974, Ronnie re-formed the Ronettes and began performing again.

In 1980, Spector released her debut solo album &quot;Siren&quot;. Her career revived when she was featured on Eddie Money&#x27;s song and video &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot; in 1986, a &quot;Billboard&quot; top five single. She went on to release the albums &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (1987), &quot;Something&#x27;s Gonna Happen&quot; (2003), &quot;Last of the Rock Stars&quot; (2006) and &quot;English Heart&quot; (2016). She also recorded one extended play, &quot;She Talks to Rainbows&quot; (1999). In 1990, Ronnie Spector published a memoir, &quot;Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, Or, My Life as a Fabulous Ronette&quot;. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Ronettes in 2007. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Spector at number 70 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== Early life ==
Spector was born Veronica Yvette Bennett in East Harlem, New York City, and grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. She was the daughter of Beatrice and Louis Bennett, a subway worker. Her mother was African American and Cherokee, and her father was Irish. Bennett and her sister Estelle Bennett (1941–2009) were encouraged to sing by their large family, as was their cousin Nedra Talley (born 1946). The trio formed the Darling Sisters, known later as the Ronettes. They performed locally while attending George Washington High School in Washington Heights. Their look was fashioned by Estelle, who had a job at Macy&#x27;s on the cosmetics counter. They sang at school events, and had a residency at the Peppermint Lounge, a nightspot in Manhattan, the birthplace of the Twist and go-go dancing.

==Career==

===1963–1969: The Ronettes and early success===

The Ronettes became a popular live attraction around the greater New York area in the early 1960s. Looking for a recording contract, they initially were signed to Colpix Records and produced by Stu Phillips. After releasing a few singles on Colpix without success, they tracked down record producer Phil Spector, who signed them to his label Philles Records in 1963. Their relationship with Spector brought chart success with their biggest hit &quot;Be My Baby&quot; in 1963, which peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A string of top 40 pop hits followed with &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; (1963), &quot;(The Best Part of) Breakin&#x27; Up&quot; (1964), &quot;Do I Love You?&quot; (1964), and &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; (1964). The group had two entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1965 with &quot;Born to Be Together&quot; and &quot;Is This What I Get for Loving You?&quot;.

In 1965, the Ronettes were voted the third-top singing group in England behind the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. They opened for the Beatles on their 1966 US tour without their lead singer. Phil had forbidden Bennett to tour with the Beatles, so her cousin Elaine stood in as a third member. The group&#x27;s last charting single, &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot;, was produced by Jeff Barry and reached No. 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1966.

The Ronettes broke up in early 1967, following a European concert tour. After Bennett married Phil in 1968, she began to use the name Ronnie Spector, but she withdrew from the spotlight because Phil prohibited her from performing and limited her recordings. In 1969, Phil signed a production deal with A&amp;M Records and he released her record &quot;You Came, You Saw, You Conquered&quot;, credited as &quot;The Ronettes Featuring the Voice of Veronica&quot;, with &quot;Oh I Love You&quot;, an old Ronettes B-side, as the flip. Her vocals were used for the lead and backing vocals. Phil kept many of the group&#x27;s unreleased songs in a vault for years.

===1970–1982: Solo career and &quot;Siren&quot;===
In February 1971, Ronnie Spector recorded the song &quot;Try Some, Buy Some/Tandoori Chicken&quot; at Abbey Road Studios during Phil&#x27;s work with George Harrison. Written by Harrison, and produced by both Harrison and Phil, her debut solo single was released on Apple Records in April 1971. It peaked at No. 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1971. Although the single was not a big hit, its backing track was used two years later for Harrison&#x27;s own version of the song, on his chart-topping &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; album. &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; had another lasting influence when John Lennon recorded &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; later the same year and asked Phil (co-producing again) to reproduce the mandolin-laden Wall of Sound he had created for that single. Lennon liked the rockabilly B-side too; he sang it at his birthday party in New York City in October 1971 (a recording of which has appeared on bootlegs). Spector recorded other Harrison songs during those London sessions – including &quot;You&quot; and &quot;When Every Song Is Sung&quot; – but her versions were never released, even though a full album had been planned.

After separating from Phil in 1972, she reformed the Ronettes (as Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes) with two new members (Chip Fields Hurd, the mother of actress Kim Fields, and Diane Linton) in 1973. They released a few singles on Buddah Records, but the records failed to chart.

In 1973, Spector provided backing-vocals with Liza Minnelli for Alice Cooper&#x27;s song &quot;Teenage Lament &#x27;74&quot; from the album &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; (1973). By 1975, Spector was recording as a solo act. She released the single &quot;You&#x27;d Be Good For Me&quot; on Tom Cat Records in 1975.

In 1976, she sang a duet with Southside Johnny on the recording &quot;You Mean So Much To Me&quot;, penned by Southside&#x27;s longtime friend Bruce Springsteen. This was the final track on the Southside Johnny &amp; the Asbury Jukes&#x27; debut album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Go Home&quot;. She also made appearances with the E Street Band the following year, including a cover version of Billy Joel&#x27;s 1976 track &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot;.

In her book, Spector recounted several abortive attempts to recapture mainstream success throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, during which time she was perceived as an oldies act. She recorded her first solo album in 1980, &quot;Siren&quot;, produced by Genya Ravan.

===1983–2002: &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, and return to music===
In 1986, Ronnie Spector enjoyed a resurgence of popular radio airplay as the featured vocalist on Eddie Money&#x27;s Top 5 hit, &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, in which she answers Money&#x27;s chorus lyric, &quot;just like Ronnie sang&quot;, with, &quot;be my little baby&quot;. The song&#x27;s music video was one of the top videos of the year and in heavy rotation on MTV. During this period, she also recorded the song &quot;Tonight You&#x27;re Mine, Baby&quot; (from the film &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot;).

In 1988, she began performing at the Ronnie Spector&#x27;s Christmas Party, a seasonal staple at B.B. King Blues Club &amp; Grill in New York City. In 1999, she released the EP, &quot;She Talks to Rainbows&quot;, which featured a few covers of older songs. Joey Ramone acted as producer.

In 1988, she and the other members of the Ronettes sued Phil Spector for nonpayment of royalties and for unpaid income he made from licensing of Ronettes’ music. In 2001, a New York court announced a verdict in favor of the Ronettes, ordering him to pay $2.6 million in back royalties. The judgment was overturned by a Court of Appeals in 2002 and remanded back to the New York State Supreme Court. The judges found that their contract gave Phil unconditional rights to the recordings. It was ruled that Ronnie was entitled to her share of the royalties, which she had forfeited in her divorce settlement, but they reversed a lower court&#x27;s ruling that the group were entitled to the music industry&#x27;s standard 50 percent royalty rate. In the outcome, Phil paid in excess of $1 million to Ronnie Spector. In December 1998, having just signed to the Creation Records label, she appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;.

===2003–2022: Collaborations and &quot;English Heart&quot;===
In 2003, Ronnie Spector provided backing vocals for The Misfits&#x27; album &quot;Project 1950&quot; on the songs &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; and &quot;You Belong to Me.&quot; In 2004, the Ronettes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.
Spector provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Ode to LA&quot;, on The Raveonettes&#x27; album &quot;Pretty in Black&quot; (2005). Her album, &quot;Last of the Rock Stars&quot; (2006), was released by High Coin and featured contributions from members of The Raconteurs, Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Raveonettes, Patti Smith, and Keith Richards. Spector herself co-produced two of the songs. Despite objections from Phil Spector, who was awaiting trial for murder, the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.

A Christmas EP, &quot;Ronnie Spector&#x27;s Best Christmas Ever&quot;, was released on Bad Girl Sounds in November 2010, featuring five new Christmas songs. In 2011, after the death of Amy Winehouse, Spector released her version of Winehouse&#x27;s single &quot;Back to Black&quot; (2006) as a tribute and for the benefit of the Daytop Village addiction treatment centers. She also performed this song as part of her live act, including in 2015 during a UK tour. She appeared on the 2014 New Year&#x27;s Eve edition of the &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot;.

In 2016, she released, through 429 Records, &quot;English Heart&quot;, her first album of new material in a decade. The album features her versions of songs of the British Invasion by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Bee Gees, and others, produced by Scott Jacoby. &quot;English Heart&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart. On August 9, 2017, &quot;People&quot; premiered a new single, &quot;Love Power&quot; by Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes, produced by Narada Michael Walden, making it the first Ronettes single in decades.

In 2018, Spector appeared in the music documentary &quot;Amy Winehouse: Back to Black&quot; (2018), based on Winehouse and her final studio album &quot;Back to Black&quot;. The album was inspired by 1960s girl groups Winehouse gathered inspiration from listening to, such as The Ronettes. It contained new interviews as well as archival footage. Spector was a great inspiration for Winehouse, who emulated her hair, as well as vocal style. In return, Ronnie Spector covered &quot;Back to Black&quot;, the Winehouse&#x27;s signature song. She recalls that Winehouse turned up at a concert looking just like her while she sang her song. Spector recalled seeing &quot;a tear out of her (Winehouse) eye and it made me cry&quot;.

In September 2020, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that actress Zendaya would portray Spector in a biopic adapted from her memoir &quot;Be My Baby&quot;. In December 2021, the Ronettes returned to the Top 10 for the first time in 58 years with their 1963 recording of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;. Following her death in January 2022, the BBC broadcast the compilation tribute &quot;Ronnie Spector at the BBC&quot;.

==Autobiography==
She released her memoir &quot;Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, Or, My Life as a Fabulous Ronette&quot; in 1990; the book was later named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contributor Rob Sheffield as one of the greatest rock biographies of all time. An updated version titled &quot;Be My Baby: A Memoir&quot; was completed in late 2021, just two months before Spector&#x27;s death, and was released in May 2022.

==Personal life and death==

Ronnie and Phil Spector began having an affair soon after she was signed to his label in 1963. Early in their relationship, she was unaware that he was married. Once, Ronnie was apprehended by house detectives for prostitution at the Delmonico Hotel in New York City after leaving a room they had booked. She was allowed to call Phil, who threatened the hotel, and then they allowed her to leave. After Phil divorced his wife in 1965, he purchased a home in Beverly Hills, where he lived with Ronnie. They married at Beverly Hills City Hall on April 14, 1968. Ronnie changed her surname and became known as Ronnie Spector. Their son Donté Phillip was adopted in 1969. Two years later, Phil surprised her for Christmas with adopted twins, Louis and Gary.

Ronnie alleged in her 1990 memoir that following their marriage, Phil subjected her to years of psychological torment and sabotaged her career by forbidding her to perform. She said he surrounded their house with barbed wire and guard dogs, and confiscated her shoes to prevent her from leaving; on the rare occasions he allowed her out alone, she had to drive with a life-size dummy of Phil. She stated that Phil installed a gold coffin with a glass top in the basement, promising that he would kill her and display her corpse if she ever left him. She began drinking and attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings to escape the house.

In 1972, Ronnie fled their mansion barefoot and without any belongings, with the help of her mother. &quot;I knew that if I didn&#x27;t leave I was going to die there,&quot; she said. In their 1974 divorce settlement, Ronnie forfeited all future record earnings, alleging that Phil had threatened to have a hit man kill her. She received $25,000, a used car, and monthly alimony of $2,500 for five years. She later testified that Phil had frequently pulled a gun on her during their marriage and threatened to kill her unless she surrendered custody of their children.

She tried to rebuild her career, keeping Spector&#x27;s surname professionally because &quot;I needed any way I could to get back in, I&#x27;d been kept away so long.&quot; According to her, Phil hired lawyers to prevent her singing her popular songs and denied her royalties. In 1988, the Ronettes sued Phil for $10 million in damages, rescission of the contract, the return of the masters, and recoupment of money received from the sale of Ronettes masters. It took 10 years for the case to make it to trial. After a prolonged legal battle, the court ruled that their contract gave Phil unconditional rights to the recordings but Ronnie was entitled to her share of royalties.

In 1983, she married her manager Jonathan Greenfield. They had two sons, and lived in Danbury, Connecticut.

Spector died at her home in Danbury on January 12, 2022, shortly after a cancer diagnosis, at the age of 78.

<doc id="1170160" wikidata="Q2467946" url="?curid=1170160" title="Chirality (mathematics)">
<text>In geometry, a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it is not identical to its mirror image, or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by rotations and translations alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be &quot;achiral&quot;.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word &quot;chirality&quot; is derived from the Greek (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word &quot;enantiomorph&quot; stems from the Greek (enantios) &#x27;opposite&#x27; + (morphe) &#x27;form&#x27;.

== Examples==
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the right-hand rule.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them .

The J-, L-, S- and Z-shaped &quot;tetrominoes&quot; of the popular video game Tetris also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral if and only if its symmetry group contains at least one &quot;orientation-reversing&quot; isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any isometry can be written as formula_1 with an orthogonal matrix formula_2 and a vector formula_3. The determinant of formula_2 is either 1 or −1 then. If it is −1 the isometry is orientation-reversing, otherwise it is orientation-preserving.

A general definition of chirality based on group theory exists. It does not refer to any orientation concept: an isometry is direct if and only if it is a product of squares of isometries, and if not, it is an indirect isometry. The resulting chirality definition works in spacetime.

==Chirality in two dimensions==
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an axis of symmetry is achiral, and it can be shown that every &quot;bounded&quot; achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An &quot;axis of symmetry&quot; of a figure formula_5 is a line formula_6, such that formula_5 is invariant under the mapping formula_8, when formula_6 is chosen to be the formula_10-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a triangle is achiral if it is equilateral or isosceles, and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a frieze group generated by a single glide reflection.

==Chirality in three dimensions==

In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a mirror plane of symmetry &quot;S1&quot;, an inversion center of symmetry &quot;S2&quot;, or a higher improper rotation (rotoreflection) &quot;Sn&quot; axis of symmetry is achiral. (A &quot;plane of symmetry&quot; of a figure formula_5 is a plane formula_12, such that formula_5 is invariant under the mapping formula_14, when formula_12 is chosen to be the formula_10-formula_17-plane of the coordinate system. A &quot;center of symmetry&quot; of a figure formula_5 is a point formula_19, such that formula_5 is invariant under the mapping formula_21, when formula_19 is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:formula_23

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry formula_24 and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:formula_25

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Achiral figures can have a center axis.

==Knot theory==

A knot is called achiral if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a chiral knot. For example, the unknot and the figure-eight knot are achiral, whereas the trefoil knot is chiral.

<doc id="1170163" wikidata="Q629977" url="?curid=1170163" title="Arbitrista">
<text>The arbitristas were a group of reformist thinkers in late 16th and 17th century Spain concerned about the decline of the economy of Spain and proposed a number of measures to reverse it. &quot;Arbitristas&quot; directed analyses of problem and proposals (&quot;memorials&quot;) for their solution to the king, asking him to take a particular action in the economic or political sphere. The increase in the production of proposals and analyses outlining solutions to the perceived problems of the empire were at a pace comparable to the inflation in the real economy during the price revolution of the sixteenth century and increased further with the crisis of the seventeenth century.

==General description==

&quot;Arbitrismo&quot; developed mainly in Castile during the second half of the sixteenth century and the seventeenth century. It is related intellectually to the School of Salamanca. &quot;Arbitrismo&quot; is part of the first economic literature worthy of such a name, simultaneously and largely based on the mercantilism of other European kingdoms, such as France and England. The solution (&quot;arbitrio&quot;) in this context to any measure that the monarch can adopt for the benefit of the realm, in the exercise of his sovereignty and by his own will. In the plural, &quot;arbitrios&quot; was a name given to certain taxes used for public expenditures; it was also applied to a fiscal figure who reports short-term benefits and does not require negotiation with taxpayers. The &quot;arbitristas&quot; outlined specific reforms aimed at reversing Spain&#x27;s perceived decline.
The &quot;arbitristas&quot; ... of the early seventeenth century all put forward programmes of reform. Royal expenditure must be regulated, the sale of office halted, the growth of the church checked. The tax system must be overhauled, special concessions be made to agricultural laborers, rivers be made navigable and dry lands irrigated. In this way alone could Castile&#x27;s productivity increased, its commerce restored, and its humiliating dependence on foreigners, on the Dutch and the Genoese, be brought to an end.
&quot;Arbitristas&quot; put faith in empiricism, so that they gathered information about an identified problem and then sought the solution. Some &quot;arbitristas&quot; argued that the large quantities of silver and gold arriving from the mines in Spain&#x27;s American colonies was doing great damage to the Spanish economy. The Spanish &quot;valido&quot; Count-Duke of Olivares was strongly influenced by the &quot;arbitristas&quot;. &quot;Arbitristas&quot; were also present in the Indies, where they sought the ear of the viceroys.

&quot;Arbitrio&quot; and &quot;arbitrista&quot; (&quot;solution&quot;, &quot;one who solves&quot;) came to be considered derogatory at the time. They were seen to be equivalent to absurd and impossible opinions and certain characters called &quot;crazy reasoners&quot; or &quot;republican and government crazy&quot; of the time. The first use of the concept of &quot;arbitrismo&quot; in that context has been found in &quot;El coloquio de los perros&quot;, one of the &quot;Exemplary Novels&quot; of Miguel de Cervantes (1613). Francisco de Quevedo, in several passages of his works, describes well-meaning &quot;arbitristas&quot; (&quot;arcigogolantes&quot;) as the cause of all kinds of catastrophes; one of them is so engrossed in writing his theories that he does not realize that he has taken out an eye with his pen. Some of their more outlandish schemes were satirized, including inventors of useless gadgets and alchemy. This attitude of ridicule is still present in the colloquial meaning of the word.

==Notable &quot;arbitristas&quot;==
===Tomás de Mercado===
Tomás de Mercado, a Sevillian who died in 1575, continued in the tradition of the School of Salamanca and when young went to Mexico. His vision of Spain&#x27;s economic problems took into account the Indies. He became a Dominican friar in 1553, earning a doctorate in theology and standing out as a moralist. He reflected on the ethics of commercial relations and on returning to Spain he taught at the universities of Seville and Salamanca. In 1569 he published &quot;Sum of deals and contracts&quot; (&quot;Suma de tratos y contratos&quot;), that was reedited two years later. It describes the mercantile uses of the time in Seville and Medina del Campo. This work reflects on the foundation of interest praising the ethical uses of finances and counter to the restrictive interpretation of the Catholic Church that deemed it usury. The analysis raises and deepens the quantitative theory of money from the tradition of the School of Salamanca, especially with regard to the international circulation of foreign currency.

===Luis Ortiz===
Luis Ortiz was active during the second half of the sixteenth century and accountant of the Treasury of Castile during the reign of Philip II, wrote a memorial to the King so that no monies leave Spain, after the bankruptcy of the Austrias. This was the first text of the Spanish mercantilists, in which he considers that the decline in prices lies in the conservation of gold in Castile and, for this purpose, he creates a plan with which he intends to promote resources. The memorial was published in 1558 and did not have much impact, despite to its illuminating analysis of the economic crisis of the kingdom. Among the main measures proposed was the withdrawal of all types of leisure, the introduction of work and the creation of manufactured products instead of only exporting raw materials, as well as the abolition of existing customs between the various Hispanic kingdoms, the disentailment of church property and a tax reform. He analyzed the monetary problems of Spain and studied solutions to solve the situations created in the country because of the tendency to export raw materials and import manufactures paid with the gold from the Indies. He intuited the concept of economic structure and consistently proposed not one, but a wide range of initiatives that could have brought the kingdom out of the morass it was in, such as increasing productivity, promoting population growth, extending irrigation and starting a repopulation forest. Moreover, he was aware of the problem arising from the remittances of gold and silver that came from the Indies and proposed restricting monetary expansion and discouraging consumption.

===Martín González de Cellorigo===
Martín González de Cellorigo, born in Pancorbo (Burgos) in 1559 and died around 1633, was active during the first half of the seventeenth century. He studied at the University of Valladolid and was a lawyer of the Royal Chancery there. He continued the ideas of the School of Salamanca and directed two memorials to the future Philip III of Spain, noting that the inflation caused by the arrival of American silver was the main cause of the evils of the kingdom, since the money in circulation should be limited to the amount of transactions produced. It was his conviction that wealth only grows &quot;by the natural and artificial industry&quot; and, therefore, speculative operations and administrative privileges actually impoverished the kingdom generating the abandonment of trades and productive activities. In 1600 his main work was published, &quot;Memorial of the necessary and useful policy of restoration of Spain and its states, and universal performance of these kingdoms&quot;. In &quot;Memorial&quot;, he denounced the proposal of the expulsion of the Moriscos, a policy that was not popular with the arbitristas of the time. His views on Moriscos in general, however, may have been more complex as he also wrote in (1600) that &quot;Spain has become a republic of bewitched beings who live outside the natural order&quot; 

===Sancho Moncada===
Sancho Moncada, also in the seventeenth century, can be considered equally linked to the School of Salamanca. In 1619 he wrote some Discourses that would later be reissued in 1746 as the &quot;Political Restoration of Spain&quot;. He delves into the quantitative theory of money and represents the most complete Spanish model of mercantilism. He pointed out the weaknesses of the Spanish economy and especially the penury and the invasion of foreign products, and denounced that the kingdom had become a debtor of the enemy powers. His solution was to propose a severe protectionism of mercantile discipline supervised by the Inquisition. In addition, it was necessary to promote the industry as Jean-Baptiste Colbert would later propose in France. His work, unlike that of other arbitrators, enjoyed great prestige and influence and was taken over by the great enlightened of the eighteenth century, when it was reissued.

===Pedro Fernández de Navarrete===
The Riojan Pedro Fernández de Navarrete (1564 - 1632), canon of Santiago, Seneca translator humanist and royal adviser, was inspired by Cellorigo and Moncada to write his &quot;Conservation of Monarchies&quot;, a work of mercantilist bias that advocated the control of imports and the promotion of exports, although it did not fall into the trap of bullionism, because it understood that the overabundance of money is pernicious if there are no goods that can be acquired. He proposed the development of productive investments and criticized the luxury and contempt for industrial and manual trades by the nobility and nobility of Spain of his time.

===Luis Valle de la Cerda===

Luis Valle de la Cerda wrote in 1600 &quot;Performance of the Patrímonto of His Majesty and of the kingdoms, without damage of the King and vassals, and with rest and relief of all, through the public Treasury and Montes de Piedad&quot;. His work was highly valued by the Cortes, which supported this initiative, and reissued it in 1618. The Montes de Piedad was an idea in a way similar to the Granados that already worked, as credit entities of municipal foundation and grain stores that lent to the farmers.

The foundation of the first Monte de Piedad was made in Madrid by Father Piquer in the early eighteenth century, and in the mid-nineteenth century was associated with the Savings Bank (founded by the Marquis of Pontejos). These financial institutions already correspond to a protocapitalist world, in which other important institutions also functioned, such as the Five Greater Guilds of Madrid or the Bank of San Carlos, antecedent of the Bank of Spain.

===Juan de Castro===
Juan de Castro was a priest with ties to the Genoese banking community. His critique of the economy focused on the lack of data to understand the most basic aspects of the overseas trade. These included the lack of knowledge of demand for goods, the proportion of foreign goods to domestic sent to the Indies, and comparative prices of goods in European markets. Spanish merchants functioned without knowledge of matters in which European merchants were experts. He also commented on the socioeconomic patterns of foreign merchants, whose sons married Spanish women and their sons could operate legally within the restrictive Spanish system, but the most promising of these young men were sent to Genoa to learn the real mechanics of international trade. These foreign enterprises with insider status were a part of extended family enterprises, so that they could operate on a truly international scale. “They were well positioned to exploit colonial markets to the disadvantage of their under-capitalized and poorly informed Spanish competitors whose capital averaged [only] 20,000 pesos.” Foreign merchants did not want to completely undermine the structure of trade, so made loans to Spanish merchant firms to keep them participating in the trade.

===Other writers===
Antonio Serra, a Neapolitan (and therefore a subject of the same Catholic Monarchy of the Habsburgs), wrote &quot;Breve trattato delle causa che possono far abbondare&quot; with the historical and intellectual context of Castilian &quot;abitrismo&quot;. He attributed the shortage of currency in the Kingdom of Naples to a deficit in the balance of payments, a term that it defines with a complete analysis, rejecting the idea that the monetary shortage could be due to the exchange rate, and proposing export incentives as a solution. It also seems that he formulated a similar concept to the law of diminishing returns for agriculture.

Antonio López de Vega (&quot; Heraclitus and Democritus of our century &quot;), considered war the cause of decadence.

Francisco Martínez de Mata (&quot; Memorials and Discourses &quot;, 1650–1660), was &quot;critical of foreign merchants who left Spain only &#x27;the responsibility of keeping [the colonies] while Spaniards are their miserable servants&#x27;.&quot; He urged the revival of Spanish manufacturing, the end of foreign tax farmers, and the creation of an investment bank to provide credit to Spanish entrepreneurs.

The BC Lions took the opening kickoff and fashioned an impressive drive that started and ended with a Jason Clermont reception. Quarterback Dave Dickenson was perfect on a series of short precision passes, taking the Lions from their own 38-yard-line down the field for a touchdown and an early 7-0 lead. The scoring play was a 12-yard toss to Clermont on a play fake that drew away the Toronto defence, which looked bewildered on the whole series.

Toronto nearly hit a field goal later in the quarter, but a flag was thrown on Noel Prefontaine&#x27;s 39-yard attempt. The subsequent kick from 47 yards missed, leaving BC pinned near its own goal line.

But Dickenson engineered a series of first downs as the quarter wound down, moving the Lions to midfield with help from receivers Geroy Simon and Ryan Thelwell and a nine-yard carry by Antonio Warren. Duncan O&#x27;Mahony punted as the quarter ended, angling the ball out of bounds at the Argos&#x27; 21-yard line. Overall, BC had the ball in their possession a whopping 11 minutes in the opening 15.

Damon Allen failed to ignite the Argos offence early in the second quarter, despite two quick chances thanks to a punt return fumble by Aaron Lockett of the Lions. On the second of two Noel Prefontaine punts, Lockett held on to the ball and ran BC to its own 50-yard line. But the Lions couldn&#x27;t move the ball. Trying to avoid dangerous punt returner Bashir Levingston, BC kicker Duncan O&#x27;Mahony angled his punt out of bounds for only nine yards, giving Toronto good field position.

A long completion from Allen to R. Jay Soward moved the Argos to the BC 20, and a 27-yard field goal by Prefontaine put Toronto on the board.

Allen began to find his receivers on Toronto&#x27;s next drive, hitting Robert Baker for a 35-yarder and a 20-yarder to move inside the Lions&#x27; red zone. A pass interference call against the Lions then put the ball at the 1-yard line, and Allen plunged across for the touchdown and the Argos&#x27; first lead.

BC responded immediately, getting into field goal range on a Jason Clermont catch from Dave Dickenson. Duncan O&#x27;Mahony hit a 42-yarder to draw the Lions even. But just before the half, Allen again connected with Baker for a 23-yard touchdown.

The field-position advantage enjoyed by the Toronto Argonauts in the second quarter continued on the opening drive of the second half, as Allen got the ball at midfield. Allen moved the ball efficiently again, and for the second time in the game dove for a one-yard touchdown to give the Argos a 14-point lead.

Dave Dickenson had some success moving the ball for BC, but the Lions could only muster a 36-yard field goal by Duncan O&#x27;Mahony.

On Toronto&#x27;s next possession, Allen went down with an apparent leg injury while running for a first down. Ironically, the play was called back on a holding penalty. Michael Bishop replaced Allen at quarterback while the 41-year-old received treatment on the bench.

The Lions defence got its best pressure of the game on Bishop early in the fourth, forcing an errant pass then nearly causing a fumble on the next play.

Dave Dickenson took over for the Lions at his own 10-yard line, and engineered an impressive drive. Lyle Green caught two passes for first downs before running back Antonio Warren took over. Warren ran for 30 and 15 yards, setting up a Lions touchdown on Dave Dickenson&#x27;s five-yard rush and dive into the end zone. Two consecutive time-count violations on a two-point conversion attempt pushed Duncan O&#x27;Mahony back for a 22-yard convert attempt that went wide.

Damon Allen returned to the game for the Argos, and was promptly decked as he tried to pass by a charging Barrin Simpson.

Dickenson just missed a streaking Geroy Simon&#x27;s outstretched hands to stop the next BC drive, and Toronto took over again with a short field.

Allen found Tony Miles wide open and pushed down to the Lions&#x27; 10-yard line with the clock at three minutes and counting. Noel Prefontaine pushed the Argos&#x27; lead to eight points on a short field goal.

BC failed to move the ball on what would turn out to be its last chance with the ball, Dickenson just missing the outstretched hands of Simon on a bomb attempt.

With the ball back, the Argos got two crucial first downs and wound down the clock to win the game and their 15th Grey Cup.

==Notable participants==

<doc id="1170166" wikidata="Q214514" url="?curid=1170166" title="Chirality (chemistry)">
<text>In chemistry, a molecule or ion is called chiral () if it cannot be superposed on its mirror image by any combination of rotations, translations, and some conformational changes. This geometric property is called chirality (). The terms are derived from Ancient Greek (&quot;cheir&quot;) &#x27;hand&#x27;; which is the canonical example of an object with this property.

A chiral molecule or ion exists in two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other, called enantiomers; they are often distinguished as either &quot;right-handed&quot; or &quot;left-handed&quot; by their absolute configuration or some other criterion. The two enantiomers have the same chemical properties, except when reacting with other chiral compounds. They also have the same physical properties, except that they often have opposite optical activities. A homogeneous mixture of the two enantiomers in equal parts is said to be racemic, and it usually differs chemically and physically from the pure enantiomers.

Chiral molecules will usually have a stereogenic element from which chirality arises. The most common type of stereogenic element is a stereogenic center, or stereocenter. In the case of organic compounds, stereocenters most frequently take the form of a carbon atom with four distinct (different) groups attached to it in a tetrahedral geometry. Less commonly, other atoms like N, P, S, and Si can also serve as stereocenters, provided they have four distinct substituents (including lone pair electrons) attached to them.

A given stereocenter has two possible configurations (R and S), which give rise to stereoisomers (diastereomers and enantiomers) in molecules with one or more stereocenter. For a chiral molecule with one or more stereocenter, the enantiomer corresponds to the stereoisomer in which every stereocenter has the opposite configuration. An organic compound with only one stereogenic carbon is always chiral. On the other hand, an organic compound with multiple stereogenic carbons is typically, but not always, chiral. In particular, if the stereocenters are configured in such a way that the molecule can take a conformation having a plane of symmetry or an inversion point, then the molecule is achiral and is known as a &quot;meso&quot; compound.

Molecules with chirality arising from one or more stereocenters are classified as possessing central chirality. There are two other types of stereogenic elements that can give rise to chirality, a stereogenic axis (axial chirality) and a stereogenic plane (planar chirality). Finally, the inherent curvature of a molecule can also give rise to chirality (inherent chirality). These types of chirality are far less common than central chirality. BINOL is a typical example of an axially chiral molecule, while &quot;trans&quot;-cyclooctene is a commonly cited example of a planar chiral molecule. Finally, helicene possesses helical chirality, which is one type of inherent chirality.

Chirality is an important concept for stereochemistry and biochemistry. Most substances relevant to biology are chiral, such as carbohydrates (sugars, starch, and cellulose), all but one of the amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins, and the nucleic acids. Naturally occurring triglycerides are often chiral, but not always. In living organisms, one typically finds only one of the two enantiomers of a chiral compound. For that reason, organisms that consume a chiral compound usually can metabolize only one of its enantiomers. For the same reason, the two enantiomers of a chiral pharmaceutical usually have vastly different potencies or effects.

== Definition ==
The chirality of a molecule is based on the molecular symmetry of its conformations. A conformation of a molecule is chiral if and only if it belongs to the &quot;Cn&quot;, &quot;Dn&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;I&quot; point groups (the chiral point groups). However, whether the molecule itself is considered to be chiral depends on whether its chiral conformations are persistent isomers that could be isolated as separated enantiomers, at least in principle, or the enantiomeric conformers rapidly interconvert at a given temperature and timescale through low-energy conformational changes (rendering the molecule achiral). For example, despite having chiral &quot;gauche&quot; conformers that belong to the &quot;C&quot;2 point group, butane is considered achiral at room temperature because rotation about the central C–C bond rapidly interconverts the enantiomers (3.4 kcal/mol barrier). Similarly, &quot;cis&quot;-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane consists of chair conformers that are nonidentical mirror images, but the two can interconvert via the cyclohexane chair flip (~10 kcal/mol barrier). As another example, amines with three distinct substituents (R1R2R3N:) are also regarded as achiral molecules because their enantiomeric pyramidal conformers rapidly undergo pyramidal inversion.

However, if the temperature in question is low enough, the process that interconverts the enantiomeric chiral conformations becomes slow compared to a given timescale. The molecule would then be considered to be chiral at that temperature. The relevant timescale is, to some degree, arbitrarily defined: 1000 seconds is sometimes employed, as this is regarded as the lower limit for the amount of time required for chemical or chromatographic separation of enantiomers in a practical sense. Molecules that are chiral at room temperature due to restricted rotation about a single bond (barrier to rotation ≥ ca. 23 kcal/mol) are said to exhibit atropisomerism.

A chiral compound can contain no improper axis of rotation (&quot;Sn&quot;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking &quot;Sn&quot;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity). Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.

The following table shows some examples of chiral and achiral molecules, with the Schoenflies notation of the point group of the molecule. In the achiral molecules, X and Y (with no subscript) represent achiral groups, whereas X and X or Y and Y represent enantiomers. Note that there is no meaning to the orientation of an &quot;S&quot; axis, which is just an inversion. Any orientation will do, so long as it passes through the center of inversion. Also note that higher symmetries of chiral and achiral molecules also exist, and symmetries that do not include those in the table, such as the chiral &quot;C&quot; or the achiral &quot;S&quot;.

An example of a molecule that does not have a mirror plane or an inversion and yet would be considered achiral is 1,1-difluoro-2,2-dichlorocyclohexane (or 1,1-difluoro-3,3-dichlorocyclohexane). This may exist in many conformers (conformational isomers), but none of them has a mirror plane. In order to have a mirror plane, the cyclohexane ring would have to be flat, widening the bond angles and giving the conformation a very high energy. This compound would not be considered chiral because the chiral conformers interconvert easily.

An achiral molecule having chiral conformations could theoretically form a mixture of right-handed and left-handed crystals, as often happens with racemic mixtures of chiral molecules (see Chiral resolution#Spontaneous resolution and related specialized techniques), or as when achiral liquid silicon dioxide is cooled to the point of becoming chiral quartz.

==Stereogenic centers==
A &quot;stereogenic center&quot; (or &quot;stereocenter&quot;) is an atom such that swapping the positions of two ligands (connected groups) on that atom results in a molecule that is stereoisomeric to the original. For example, a common case is a tetrahedral carbon bonded to four distinct groups a, b, c, and d (Cabcd), where swapping any two groups (e.g., Cbacd) leads to a stereoisomer of the original, so the central C is a stereocenter. Many chiral molecules have point chirality, namely a single chiral stereogenic center that coincides with an atom. This stereogenic center usually has four or more bonds to different groups, and may be carbon (as in many biological molecules), phosphorus (as in many organophosphates), silicon, or a metal (as in many chiral coordination compounds). However, a stereogenic center can also be a trivalent atom whose bonds are not in the same plane, such as phosphorus in P-chiral phosphines (PRR′R″) and sulfur in S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′), because a lone-pair of electrons is present instead of a fourth bond.
Similarly, a stereogenic axis (or plane) is defined as an axis (or plane) in the molecule such that the swapping of any two ligands attached to the axis (or plane) gives rise to a stereoisomer. For instance, the C2-symmetric species 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) and 1,3-dichloroallene have stereogenic axes and exhibit axial chirality, while (&quot;E&quot;)-cyclooctene and many ferrocene derivatives bearing two or more substituents have stereogenic planes and exhibit planar chirality.

Chirality can also arise from isotopic differences between atoms, such as in the deuterated benzyl alcohol PhCHDOH; which is chiral and optically active ([&quot;α&quot;]D = 0.715°), even though the non-deuterated compound PhCH2OH is not.

If two enantiomers easily interconvert, the pure enantiomers may be practically impossible to separate, and only the racemic mixture is observable. This is the case, for example, of most amines with three different substituents (NRR′R″), because of the low energy barrier for nitrogen inversion.

When the optical rotation for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit cryptochirality.

Chirality is an intrinsic part of the identity of a molecule, so the systematic name includes details of the absolute configuration (&quot;R/S&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or other designations).

==Manifestations of chirality==
* Flavor: the artificial sweetener aspartame has two enantiomers. -aspartame tastes sweet whereas -aspartame is tasteless.
* Odor: &quot;R&quot;-(–)-carvone smells like spearmint whereas &quot;S&quot;-(+)-carvone smells like caraway.
* Drug effectiveness: the antidepressant drug citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture. However, studies have shown that only the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer (escitalopram) is responsible for the drug&#x27;s beneficial effects.
* Drug safety: ‑penicillamine is used in chelation therapy and for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis whereas ‑penicillamine is toxic as it inhibits the action of pyridoxine, an essential B vitamin.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and sugars.

The origin of this homochirality in biology is the subject of much debate. Most scientists believe that Earth life&#x27;s &quot;choice&quot; of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.

Enzymes, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas -forms tend to taste sweet. Spearmint leaves contain the -enantiomer of the chemical carvone or &quot;R&quot;-(−)-carvone and caraway seeds contain the -enantiomer or &quot;S&quot;-(+)-carvone. The two smell different to most people because our olfactory receptors are chiral.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.

== In inorganic chemistry ==
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a property of any part of the periodic table. Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral. Quartz is an example from the mineral kingdom. Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in nonlinear optics.

In the areas of coordination chemistry and organometallic chemistry, chirality is pervasive and of practical importance. A famous example is tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement. The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+ may be designated as Λ (capital lambda, the Greek version of &quot;L&quot;) for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital delta, Greek &quot;D&quot;) for a right-handed twist (pictured). dextro- and levo-rotation (the clockwise and counterclockwise optical rotation of plane-polarized light) uses similar notation, but shouldn&#x27;t be confused.

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-amino acid complexes. If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of asymmetric catalysis.

==Methods and practices==

The term &quot;optical activity&quot; is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or levorotatory form, of an optical isomer rotates the plane of a beam of linearly polarized light counterclockwise. The (+)-form, or dextrorotatory form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a polarimeter and is expressed as the optical rotation.

Enantiomers can be separated by chiral resolution. This often involves forming crystals of a salt composed of one of the enantiomers and an acid or base from the so-called chiral pool of naturally occurring chiral compounds, such as malic acid or the amine brucine. Some racemic mixtures spontaneously crystallize into right-handed and left-handed crystals that can be separated by hand. Louis Pasteur used this method to separate left-handed and right-handed sodium ammonium tartrate crystals in 1849. Sometimes it is possible to seed a racemic solution with a right-handed and a left-handed crystal so that each will grow into a large crystal.

Liquid chromatography (HPLC and TLC) may also be used as an analytical method for the direct separation of enantiomers and the control of enantiomeric purity, e.g. active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) which are chiral.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-racemic chiral substance is called scalemic. Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.
* A chiral substance is enantiopure when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample have the same chirality sense. Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged.
* A chiral substance is enantioenriched or heterochiral when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.
* Enantiomeric excess or e.e. is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of &quot;R&quot; contains 70% &quot;R&quot; and 30% &quot;S&quot; (70% − 30% = 40%).

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1812, and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. Louis Pasteur deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis. The term &quot;chirality&quot; itself was coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894. Different enantiomers or diastereomers of a compound were formerly called optical isomers due to their different optical properties. At one time, chirality was thought to be restricted to organic chemistry, but this misconception was overthrown by the resolution of a purely inorganic compound, a cobalt complex called hexol, by Alfred Werner in 1911.

In the early 1970s, various groups established that the human olfactory organ is capable of distinguishing chiral compounds.

<text>Edmund James Banfield (4 September 1852 – 2 June 1923) was an author and naturalist in Queensland, Australia. He is best known for his book &quot;Confessions of a Beachcomber&quot;. His grave on Dunk Island is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

==Early life==
Banfield was born in Liverpool, England the son of Jabez Walter Banfield (1820–1899), printer, and his wife Sarah Ann (née Smith). Banfield was brought while a boy to Australia by his father, who settled at Ararat, Victoria in 1852 and became proprietor of a newspaper, the &quot;Ararat Advertiser&quot;. Edmund Banfield received his first training in journalism on this paper.

==Career==
Banfield had experience with newspapers in Melbourne and Sydney in the 1870s, and in 1882 went to Townsville, Queensland, where he became sub-editor of the &quot;Townsville Bulletin&quot;. In 1884 he visited England, the voyage providing the material for a pamphlet, &quot;The Torres Strait Route from Queensland to England&quot; (1885).
While in England, Banfield met his future wife, Bertha Golding, and they were married at Townsville in 1886. Banfield remained at the &quot;Townsville Bulletin&quot; until 1897 until he resigned, being diagnosed with tuberculosis and in a state of nervous collapse. Banfield and his deaf wife then settled on Dunk Island off the North Queensland coast. With his health improving, he obtained a 30-year lease of 129 ha (320 acres) of land on Dunk Island on 4 January 1900 and lived 23 more years of a comparatively solitary life. A house was constructed, fruit-trees and vegetables were planted; goats and cattle provided them with milk, butter and occasionally meat, and there were abundant fish in the surrounding seas. Most importantly there were the immense possibilities of the nature study which made up so much of the charm of his books. For nine months in 1901, Banfield took the place of a former colleague at Townsville who was travelling abroad. Except for occasional short holidays on the mainland, he spent the rest of his days on the island. In 1907 he wrote a tourists&#x27; guide for the Queensland government, &quot;Within the Barrier&quot;, and in 1908 appeared his &quot;Confessions of a Beachcomber&quot; which immediately gave him a place of his own among Australian writers. This was followed by &quot;My Tropic Isle&quot; (1911), and &quot;Tropic Days&quot; (1918). His &quot;Last Leaves from Dunk Island&quot; was published posthumously in 1925 in collaboration with Alec Chisholm and Bertha Banfield.

The title of Banfield&#x27;s first serious book, &quot;Confessions of a Beachcomber&quot;, was misleading; he was no mere collector of trifling tales or a beachcomber in the nineteenth century tradition of a ship-wrecked sailor. Although the suggestion for the title came from the breaking up of a wreck on the coast many miles away which resulted in much debris drifting to the island. He worked hard on his plantation, and in its early days he found that work on a tropical island had its own difficulties. Once these were overcome he could get enough leisure to study the vegetable, bird and sea life of the island, and, the Aborigines before they were taken away and placed on a reservation. Visitors came and were made welcome by Banfield and his wife.

==Late life==

Banfield described Dunk Island as his &quot;Isle of Dreams—this unkempt, unrestrained garden where the centuries gaze upon perpetual summer&quot;. He became ill towards the end of May 1923 and died on 2 June 1923 of peritonitis. His wife survived him, there were no children. He was buried under a cairn on Dunk Island. His grave and the cairn are now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register as the Banfield Memorial Reserve and Grave.

<text>A chiral phenomenon is one that is not identical to its mirror image (see the article on mathematical chirality). The spin of a particle may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A symmetry transformation between the two is called parity transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a Dirac fermion is called chiral symmetry.

== Chirality and helicity ==

The helicity of a particle is positive (&quot;right-handed&quot;) if the direction of its spin is the same as the direction of its motion. It is negative (&quot;left-handed&quot;) if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard clock, with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.

Mathematically, &quot;helicity&quot; is the sign of the projection of the spin vector onto the momentum vector: &quot;left&quot; is negative, &quot;right&quot; is positive.
The chirality of a particle is more abstract: It is determined by whether the particle transforms in a right- or left-handed representation of the Poincaré group.

For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to spin in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.

For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as &quot;apparent chirality&quot;) will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.

A &quot;massless&quot; particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a &quot;relativistic invariant&quot; (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle&#x27;s chirality.

The discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested. Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement. All other observed particles have mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames.

== Chiral theories ==
Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction. In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.

Chirality for a Dirac fermion is defined through the operator, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue&#x27;s sign is equal to the particle&#x27;s chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its left- or right-handed component by acting with the projection operators or on .

The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction&#x27;s parity symmetry violation.

A common source of confusion is due to conflating the , chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that , for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.

A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.

The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.

The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.

== Chiral symmetry ==
Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:
: formula_1  and  formula_2
or
: formula_3  and   formula_4

With flavors, we have unitary rotations instead: .

More generally, we write the right-handed and left-handed states as a projection operator acting on a spinor. The right-handed and left-handed projection operators are
: formula_5
and
: formula_6

Massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry, as the mass term in the Lagrangian, , breaks chiral symmetry explicitly.

Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking may also occur in some theories, as it most notably does in quantum chromodynamics.

The chiral symmetry transformation can be divided into a component that treats the left-handed and the right-handed parts equally, known as vector symmetry, and a component that actually treats them differently, known as axial symmetry. (cf. &quot;Current algebra&quot;.) A scalar field model encoding chiral symmetry and its breaking is the chiral model.

The most common application is expressed as equal treatment of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations from a fixed frame of reference.

The general principle is often referred to by the name chiral symmetry. The rule is absolutely valid in the classical mechanics of Newton and Einstein, but results from quantum mechanical experiments show a difference in the behavior of left-chiral versus right-chiral subatomic particles.

=== Example: u and d quarks in QCD ===
Consider quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two &quot;massless&quot; quarks and (massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry). The Lagrangian reads
: formula_7

In terms of left-handed and right-handed spinors, it reads
: formula_8
(Here, is the imaginary unit and formula_9 the Dirac operator.)

Defining
: formula_10
it can be written as
: formula_11

The Lagrangian is unchanged under a rotation of &quot;q&quot;L by any 2×2 unitary matrix , and &quot;q&quot;R by any 2×2 unitary matrix .

This symmetry of the Lagrangian is called &quot;flavor chiral symmetry&quot;, and denoted as . It decomposes into
: formula_12

The singlet vector symmetry, , acts as 
: formula_13
and thus invariant under gauge symmetry. This corresponds to baryon number conservation.

The singlet axial group transforms as the following global transformation
: formula_14
However, it does not correspond to a conserved quantity, because the associated axial current is not conserved. It is explicitly violated by a quantum anomaly.

The remaining chiral symmetry turns out to be spontaneously broken by a quark condensate 
formula_15 formed through nonperturbative action of QCD gluons, into the diagonal vector subgroup known as isospin. The Goldstone bosons corresponding to the three broken generators are the three pions. 
As a consequence, the effective theory of QCD bound states like the baryons, must now include mass terms for them, ostensibly disallowed by unbroken chiral symmetry. Thus, this chiral symmetry breaking induces the bulk of hadron masses, such as those for the nucleons — in effect, the bulk of the mass of all visible matter.

In the real world, because of the nonvanishing and differing masses of the quarks, is only an approximate symmetry to begin with, and therefore the pions are not massless, but have small masses: they are pseudo-Goldstone bosons.

=== More flavors ===
For more &quot;light&quot; quark species, flavors in general, the corresponding chiral symmetries are , decomposing into
: formula_16
and exhibiting a very analogous chiral symmetry breaking pattern.

Most usually, is taken, the u, d, and s quarks taken to be light (the eightfold way), so then approximately massless for the symmetry to be meaningful to a lowest order, while the other three quarks are sufficiently heavy to barely have a residual chiral symmetry be visible for practical purposes.

=== An application in particle physics ===
In theoretical physics, the electroweak model breaks parity maximally. All its fermions are chiral Weyl fermions, which means that the charged weak gauge bosons W and W only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons.

Some theorists found this objectionable, and so conjectured a GUT extension of the weak force which has new, high energy W′ and Z′ bosons, which &quot;do&quot; couple with right handed quarks and leptons:
: formula_17
to
: formula_18

Here, (pronounced &quot; left&quot;) is from above, while is the baryon number minus the lepton number. The electric charge formula in this model is given by
: formula_19
where formula_20 and formula_21 are the left and right weak isospin values of the fields in the theory.

There is also the chromodynamic . The idea was to restore parity by introducing a left-right symmetry. This is a group extension of formula_22 (the left-right symmetry) by
: formula_23
to the semidirect product
: formula_24

This has two connected components where formula_22 acts as an automorphism, which is the composition of an involutive outer automorphism of with the interchange of the left and right copies of with the reversal of . It was shown by Mohapatra &amp; Senjanovic (1975) that left-right symmetry can be spontaneously broken to give a chiral low energy theory, which is the Standard Model of Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam, and also connects the small observed neutrino masses to the breaking of left-right symmetry via the seesaw mechanism.

In this setting, the chiral quarks
: formula_26
and
: formula_27
are unified into an irreducible representation (&quot;irrep&quot;)
: formula_28

The leptons are also unified into an irreducible representation
: formula_29

The Higgs bosons needed to implement the breaking of left-right symmetry down to the Standard Model are
: formula_30

This then provides three sterile neutrinos which are perfectly consistent with neutrino oscillation data. Within the seesaw mechanism, the sterile neutrinos become superheavy without affecting physics at low energies.

Because the left–right symmetry is spontaneously broken, left–right models predict domain walls. This left-right symmetry idea first appeared in the Pati–Salam model (1974) and Mohapatra–Pati models (1975).

<text>Kugel ( , pronounced ) is a baked casserole, most commonly made from lokshen ( ) or potato ( ). It is a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish, often served on Shabbos and Jewish holidays. American Jews also serve it for Thanksgiving dinner.

==Etymology==
The name of the dish comes from the Middle High German meaning &#x27;sphere, globe, ball&#x27;; thus the Yiddish name likely originated as a reference to the round, puffed-up shape of the original dishes (compare to German —a type of ring-shaped cake). However, nowadays kugel is often baked in square pans.

Litvaks (Jews from Lithuania, northeastern Poland and northern Russia) call the pudding , Galitzianers (Jews from southeastern Poland and western Ukraine) call it .

==History==

The first kugels were made from bread and flour and were savory rather than sweet. About 800 years ago, Jewish cooks in Germany replaced bread mixtures with lokshen noodles or farfel. Eventually eggs were incorporated. The addition of cottage cheese and milk created a custard-like consistency common in today&#x27;s dessert dishes. In Poland, Jewish homemakers added raisins, cinnamon and sweet curd cheese to noodle kugel recipes. In the late 19th century, Jerusalemites combined caramelized sugar and black pepper in a noodle kugel known as the Jerusalem kugel (), which is a commonly served at Shabbat kiddushes and is a popular side dish served with cholent during Shabbat lunch.

In Romania, this dish is called (&quot;macaroni pudding&quot;) or . It is made with or without cheese, but almost always includes raisins. In Transylvania, especially in the Hungarian-speaking regions, a very similar dish is called .

Savory kugel may be based on potatoes, matzah, cabbage, carrots, zucchini, spinach, or cheese.

Romani people call it &quot;pirogo&quot;. The Romani version is made with raisins, cream cheese, and butter.

==Varieties==
===Jerusalem kugel===

, ( &#x27;Jerusalem kugel&#x27;), also known as &quot;Galilean kugel&quot;, is an Israeli Jewish kugel dish originating from the local Jewish community of Jerusalem in the 1700s.

===Noodle kugel===
Noodle kugel () is an Ashkenazi Jewish casserole, side dish and popular variety of kugel made with lokshen noodles and either a variety of dairy or pareve ingredients.

===Potato kugel===
Potato kugel is a potato-based kugel of Ashkenazi Jewish origin, made with grated or pureed potatoes, onions, eggs, flour or matzo meal, oil, salt and pepper.

==Jewish festivals==
Kugels are a mainstay of festive meals in Ashkenazi Jewish homes, particularly on the Jewish Sabbath and other Jewish holidays or at a tish. Some Hasidic Jews believe that eating kugel on the Jewish Sabbath brings special spiritual blessings, particularly if that kugel was served on the table of a Hasidic Rebbe.

While noodle kugel, potato kugel, and other variations are dishes served on Jewish holiday meals, matzo kugel is a common alternative served at Passover seders which is adjusted to meet Passover kosher requirements.

==South African slang usage==
Among South African Jews, the word &quot;kugel&quot; was used by the elder generation as a term for a young Jewish woman who forsook traditional Jewish dress values for those of the ostentatiously wealthy and became overly materialistic and overgroomed, mirroring how the kugel is a plain pudding garnished as a delicacy. The women thus described made light of the term, and it has since become an amusing rather than derogatory slang in South African English for a materialistic young woman.

<text>Vivre sa vie () is a 1962 French New Wave drama film written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The film was released in the United States as My Life to Live and in the United Kingdom as It&#x27;s My Life.

==Plot==
:&quot;The film is divided into 12 &quot;episodes&quot;, each preceded by an intertitle.&quot;

Nana Kleinfrankenheim, a beautiful 22-year-old Parisian, leaves her husband Paul and her infant son, hoping to become an actress. The couple meet in a café and play pinball one last time before deciding to end their marriage. Now working in a record store, Nana struggles to earn enough money on her own. She tries to borrow 2,000 francs from several co-workers, but they all refuse. To make matters worse, Nana&#x27;s landlady throws her out of her apartment for not paying rent.

The next day, Nana meets with Paul, who gives her pictures of her son to keep for herself. Paul invites her to dinner, but Nana declines and explains she is seeing a film with another man. They watch &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;, moving Nana to tears. After the film, Nana ditches her date to meet with a man who promised he would take photos to promote her acting career. When asked to undress for the photos, Nana reluctantly complies.

Nana is questioned in a police station for trying to steal 1,000 francs from a woman on the street, who dropped the money in front of her. Nana returned the money out of guilt, but the woman still pressed charges. Walking down a street, Nana notices a female prostitute. A man asks Nana if he can join her, assuming she is also a prostitute; she agrees and they go to a hotel room. Nana asks him for 4,000 francs. He gives her 5,000 and says she can keep the change. Nana is visibly uncomfortable as he attempts to kiss her on the lips.

Nana runs into a friend, Yvette, and they go for lunch at a diner. Yvette reveals that she became a prostitute after her husband abandoned her and her son, as it was the easiest way to make money without him. Yvette introduces Nana to her pimp, Raoul, who is also at the diner. Nana impresses Raoul and the three play pinball when, suddenly, a police shootout ensues outside. A bloodied man who has been shot runs inside, prompting Nana to flee the diner.

Sometime later at a restaurant, Nana writes a letter asking for work (presumably as a prostitute) to an address Yvette gave her, describing herself and her physical features. Raoul sits down next to her and advises her to stay in Paris, where he can help her make more money. Nana agrees to work for him and they kiss. She quits her job at the record store and abandons her dream of becoming an actress. Raoul explains the basics of prostitution to Nana, including how to conduct herself, how much she charges and earns, when and where she works, the laws and what to do if faced with an unintended pregnancy. Nana soon begins to attract several clients.

On one of Nana&#x27;s days off, Raoul takes her to meet his friends at a bistro, where she dances to a song playing on a jukebox. The men are mostly uninterested, except for a young man playing at a billiard table who buys her a pack of cigarettes. While on the street, Nana picks up a client and takes him to a nearby hotel. The man requests she ask other prostitutes in the hotel to join them, but once one does, the client no longer wants Nana to join, so she sits on the edge of the bed and smokes.

Nana is now a seasoned prostitute and blends in with the others on the streets. She is in a hotel room with the young man she had met earlier at the bistro, who reads aloud a passage from &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. As Nana and the young man express their mutual adoration, she decides she wants to live with him and quit prostitution. When Nana confronts Raoul, they argue, as he was planning to sell her to another pimp. Raoul forces Nana into his car and drives her to the pimp&#x27;s meeting place. However, the transaction falls through and Nana ends up being killed in a gun battle. The pimps flee the scene, leaving Nana&#x27;s body lying on the pavement.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot over the course of four weeks for $40,000.

==Style==
In &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot;, Godard borrowed the aesthetics of the &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; approach to documentary film-making that was then becoming fashionable. However, this film differed from other films of the French New Wave by being photographed with a heavy Mitchell camera, as opposed to the light-weight cameras used for earlier films. The cinematographer was Raoul Coutard, a frequent collaborator of Godard&#x27;s.

==Influences==

One of the film&#x27;s original sources is a study of contemporary prostitution, &quot;Où en est la prostitution&quot; by Marcel Sacotte, an examining magistrate.

&quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; was released shortly after &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; (the film magazine for which Godard occasionally wrote) published an issue devoted to Bertolt Brecht and his theory of &#x27;epic theatre&#x27;. Godard may have been influenced by it, as &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; uses several alienation effects: twelve intertitles appear before the film&#x27;s &#x27;chapters&#x27; explaining what will happen next; jump cuts disrupt the editing flow; characters are shot from behind when they are talking; they are strongly backlit; they talk directly to the camera; the statistical results derived from official questionnaires are given in a voice-over; and so on.

The film also draws from the writings of Montaigne, Baudelaire, Zola and Edgar Allan Poe, to the cinema of Robert Bresson, Jean Renoir and Carl Dreyer. French critic Jean Douchet has written that Godard&#x27;s film &quot;would have been impossible without &quot;Street of Shame&quot; (1956), [Kenji] Mizoguchi&#x27;s last and most sublime film.&quot; Nana gets into an earnest discussion with a philosopher (played by Brice Parain, Godard&#x27;s former philosophy tutor), about the limits of speech and written language. In the next scene, as if to illustrate this point, the sound track ceases and the images are overlaid by Godard&#x27;s personal narration. This formal playfulness is typical for the way in which the director was working with sound and vision during this period.

The film depicts the consumerist culture of Godard&#x27;s Paris; a shiny new world of cinemas, coffee bars, neon-lit pool halls, pop records, photographs, wall posters, pin-ups, pinball machines, juke boxes, foreign cars, the latest hairstyles, typewriters, advertising, gangsters and Americana. It also features allusions to popular culture; for example, the scene where a melancholy young man walks into a café, puts on a juke box disc, and then sits down to listen. The unnamed actor is in fact the well known singer-songwriter Jean Ferrat, who is performing his own hit tune &quot;Ma Môme&quot; on the track that he has just selected. Nana&#x27;s bobbed haircut replicates that made famous by Louise Brooks in the 1928 film Pandora&#x27;s Box, where the doomed heroine also falls into a life of prostitution and violent death. One sequence shows a queue outside a Paris cinema waiting to see &quot;Jules et Jim&quot;, the new wave film directed by François Truffaut, at the time both a close friend and sometime rival of Godard.

==Reception==
The film was the fourth most popular movie at the French box office in its year of release. It won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1962 Venice Film Festival.

===Critical response===
Author and cultural critic Susan Sontag described &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; as &quot;a perfect film&quot; and &quot;one of the most extraordinary, beautiful, and original works of art that I know of.&quot; Her 1966 book &quot;Against Interpretation&quot; includes an essay on the film. In his essay on the film included the book &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The effect of the film is astonishing. It is clear, astringent, unsentimental, abrupt.&quot;

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; as &quot;empty and pretentious&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Anna Karina&#x27;s arresting performance provides a humanizing anchor to Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s stylistically explosive portrait of a prostitute.&quot;

<text>Dunk Island, known as Coonanglebah in the Warrgamay and Dyirbal languages, is an island within the locality of Dunk in the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It lies off the Australian east coast, opposite the town of Mission Beach. The island forms part of the Family Islands National Park and is in the larger Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.

The island is surrounded by reefs and has a diverse population of birds. The Bandjin and Djiru peoples once used the island as a source for food. Europeans first settled on the island in 1897. Dunk Island was used by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. In recent years the island and its resort facilities have been adversely affected by both Cyclone Larry and Cyclone Yasi.

==Geology and wildlife==

Dunk Island is by far the largest island in the Family Islands National Park, all of which consist of granite rock. All of the islands were part of the mainland before the last sea level rise began 8,000 years ago. Dunk Island covers 970ha, of which 730 ha is national park and the rest is freehold. Its topography varies, with sandy beaches and rocky shores, slightly undulating slopes, foothills and steeper semi-rugged terrain. Mount Kootaloo is the island&#x27;s highest point, at 271 m above sea level.

There are over 100 species of birds on Dunk Island, including rare and vulnerable seabirds. During the summer months, the island becomes a breeding site for terns and noddies. The lack of predators, along with a plentiful supply of food from the surrounding reef waters, make it an ideal nesting site. Dunk Island is also home to reptiles such as pythons, tree snakes, geckos and skinks. The island&#x27;s fringing reefs and surrounding waters are home to an array of marine life such as sea turtles, dugongs, sharks, corals, fish, shellfish and crabs. Purtaboi Island (the small island directly out from Dunk Island) is closed and inaccessible for guests from October through to April each year due to the crested terns nesting on the island.

==History==

===Early history===
The traditional Aboriginal owners of Dunk Island are the Bandjin and Djiru people, who have lived in this area for tens of thousands of years. After the sea level rise, they paddled to the islands in bark canoes to gather food and materials. The Warrgamay and Dyirbal name for Dunk Island is &quot;Coonanglebah&quot;, meaning &quot;The Island of Peace and Plenty&quot;. It received its European name from Lieutenant James Cook, who sailed past it in the &quot;Endeavour&quot; on 8 June 1770. He noted that it was a &quot;tolerable high island&quot; and named it after George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax (a former First Lord of the Admiralty).

Europeans settled the nearby mainland during the 19th century, seeking gold, timber and grazing land. In 1848, John MacGillivray studied the fauna and flora of the island while HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; was anchored off the island for ten days. He subsequently wrote of its natural features in the &quot;Narrative of the Voyage of HMS Rattlesnake&quot;, published in England in 1852.

===Edmund Banfield===
In 1897, suffering from work anxiety and exhaustion, and advised by doctors that he had just six months to live, writer Edmund James Banfield moved to Dunk Island with his wife Bertha – so becoming the island&#x27;s first white settlers. Previously a journalist and senior editor with the &quot;Townsville Daily Bulletin&quot; for fifteen years, Banfield let the tranquillity of this unspoilt tropical paradise weave its magic and he lived on Dunk Island for the remaining 26 years of his life until his death in 1923.

A small hut built with the assistance of an Aborigine called Tom was the Banfields&#x27; first home. Over a period of time they cleared four acres of land for a plantation of fruit and vegetables. Combined with their chickens, cows and goats as well as the abundance of seafood and mangrove vegetation, they lived very self-sufficiently. Fascinated by Dunk Island&#x27;s flora and fauna Banfield meticulously recorded his observations and went on to write a series of articles about island life under the pseudonym Rob Krusoe. He was further inspired to write a full-length book entitled &quot;Confessions of a Beachcomber&quot; (1908). The book became a celebrated text for romantics and escapists and established Dunk Island&#x27;s reputation as an exotic island paradise.

In the ensuing years, Banfield wrote several other books about Dunk including &quot;My Tropical Isle&quot; (1911) and &quot;Tropic Days&quot; (1918). In these he shared the secrets of nature that he had uncovered and described the customs and legends of the Aboriginal people on the island. E. J. Banfield died on 2 June 1923 and his final book &quot;Last Leaves from Dunk Island&quot; was published posthumously in 1925. His widow remained on the island for another year before moving to Brisbane where she died, ten years after her husband. Today both are buried on the trail to Mt Kootaloo.

===Commencement of the resort and World War II===

The island was bought in 1934 by Captain Brassey and Banfield&#x27;s bungalow provided the basis for the beginnings of a resort. The resort was commenced in 1936. The Royal Australian Air Force occupied Dunk Island during World War II, building its airstrip in 1941. They installed a radar station on the island&#x27;s highest point a year later, which was then dismantled when the war ended in 1945.

===Post-war development of the resort===
The Brassey family returned to run the resort for a period at the end of the war. The island then went through a succession of owners. In 1956, Gordon &amp; Kathleen Stynes purchased it and relocated their family there from Victoria. They then redeveloped and upgraded the resort&#x27;s facilities to establish the island as a tourist destination. As a result, Dunk Island became a popular destination for celebrities including Sean Connery, Henry Ford II, and Australian Prime Ministers Harold Holt and Gough Whitlam. The Stynes Family owned and operated the island and resort until 1964, when it was sold to Eric McIlree, founder of Avis Rent-A-Car.

In 1976, Trans Australia Airlines purchased Dunk Island. Ownership passed to Qantas in 1992, following its merger with Australian Airlines. On 24 December 1997, the island was purchased by P&amp;O Australian Resorts, which was acquired by Voyages in July 2004. In September 2009, both Dunk and Bedarra island resorts were purchased by Hideaway Resorts, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pamoja Capital.

===Artists&#x27; colony===
Dunk Island was also home to a small community of artists who lived, worked and showcased their work to many international and local visitors on a property on the southern side of the island. The Colony was established in 1974 by former Olympic wrestler Bruce Arthur, who died at his home on Island in March 1998. The community continued to operate under resident metalsmith Susi Kirk until Cyclone Larry damaged much of the colony. Kirk continued to live at the colony until Cyclone Yasi destroyed her home in 2011, and has subsequently continued to live and work on Dunk Island as the last member of the artist colony.

===After Cyclone Yasi, 2011–2022===
After Cyclone Yasi, Dunk Island was bought by Australian entrepreneur Peter Bond and redevelopment of the resort commenced in 2014. This redevelopment never took place.

In September 2019 Mayfair 101, an Australian family-owned investment conglomerate led by James Mawhinney, purchased Dunk Island. Mayfair 101 also secured over 250 properties on mainland Mission Beach as part of its estimated AUD1.6 billion 10-15-year plan to restore the region. Mayfair 101 was awarded the Dunk Island Spit tender on 14 November 2019 by the Cassowary Coast Regional Council, providing the opportunity for Mayfair 101 to negotiate a 30-year lease over the iconic Dunk Island Spit. The island&#x27;s redevelopment is being undertaken by Mayfair 101&#x27;s property division, Mayfair Iconic Properties, which has established a team based at Mission Beach to undertake the significant rejuvenation of the region.

In August 2020, the previous owners of the island, Family Islands Operations, owned by the family of Australian businessman Peter Bond repossessed the island after the owners Mayfair 101 failed to meet their payment obligations.

In 2021 numerous abandoned resort buildings were visible from the shore line with significant cyclone damage still visible. Windows were missing, roofs folded back, air conditioning units hanging from ceilings and plants growing inside the buildings.

=== 2022- ===
In July 2022, Annie Cannon-Brookes, wife of Atlassian founder and billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes, made a deal to buy Dunk Island. Reportedly, the transaction was between A$20-25m. The stated reason was to create a sanctuary for the natural features of the island, while also developing the resort.

==Heritage listings==
Dunk Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Banfield Memorial Reserve and Grave

==Land use==

===National park===

Dunk Island has thirteen kilometres of walking tracks spread over five main routes, ranging from a short walk to Edmund James Banfield&#x27;s grave to a 4-hour island circuit hike. Commercial operators offer guided tours around the island, as does the Dunk Island resort.

===Ferry===
The Mission Beach Dunk Island Water Taxi and Mission Beach Charters run transfers between Mission Beach and Dunk Island, and Bedarra Island guest transfers.

===Resort===
A resort on Dunk Island was first established in 1936, and it was especially popular among wealthy visitors in the 1960s. It was refurbished from the mid-1970s, and comprised 160 rooms popular with families and couples. The resort was devastated by Cyclone Yasi in 2011 and has been closed since that time. In September 2019 international investment conglomerate Mayfair 101 purchased the freehold of the island, including Dunk Island Resort, for AUD$31.5 million. The group has plans to redevelop the resort and improve facilities on the Dunk Island Spit.

===Camping ground===
There is also a camping ground available for visitors as part of the national park, although a permit is required for its use.

===Artists&#x27; colony===
The artists&#x27; colony has almost disappeared, though metalsmith Susi Kirk continues to live and work on Dunk Island as the last apparent member of the colony.

===Airstrip===
Dunk Island also has a small airstrip, Dunk Island Airport, located near the resort, which saw frequent flights to Cairns until the resort was destroyed in 2011.

=== Jetty ===
Dunk Island has a jetty which the ferry docks at to pick up and drop off passengers. This jetty can also be used for fishing and provides a view of the surrounding waters around the island.

== Climate ==
Dunk Island is located in the tropics and has an average maximum temperature of approximately 29 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit). The island is subject to tropical cyclones, and a history of cyclones affecting Dunk Island is included in Climatic Events below.

==Climatic events==

===Cyclone Larry===
On 20 March 2006, Cyclone Larry&#x27;s eye crossed the coast of Queensland at Innisfail as the Category 4. Around 160 staff members and 280 guests from Dunk Island had been evacuated to Cairns, but 20 Voyages staff stayed behind on the island. The resort suffered structural and water damage, but reopened on 1 July 2006 after an estimated $20 million of refurbishment and rebuilding.

===Cyclone Yasi===
Between AEST 23:57, 2 February 2011, and 00:27, 3 February 2011, the eye of Cyclone Yasi passed directly over Dunk Island as a Category 5 tropical cyclone. Mobile phone communication was lost due to the nearest base station at Mission Beach being destroyed and power lost at 22:00 as the cyclone approached. The resort was equipped with satellite phones and generators. Dunk Island Resort guests and some staff were flown to safety on 1 February 2011.

====Impact on Dunk Island Resort Staff====
The 69 Dunk Island Resort staff and the General Manager David Henry who were on the island at the time were forced into lockdown, four to a room, with rations that involved only a sandwich and an apple. Staff reported that they were not given the option to evacuate despite police asking the island&#x27;s management to do so a week prior. Staff stated that the resort island&#x27;s management told staff that they were required to stay and help with the clean-up, some were in fact required to return to work from the mainland as the cyclone approached including an employee who, reportedly, had sliced off part of their thumb in a boat accident. Staff reported that resort managers told them not to speak to the media. An unnamed Hideaway Resorts spokeswoman said, &quot;They (staff) were given the choice to leave or stay and many chose to stay and bunker down&quot;.

Hideaway Resorts Director Andrew Menzies denied staff were forced to stay, but could not be evacuated because the cyclone tracked south late on 2 February 2011. Menzies was quoted as saying, &quot;We followed cyclone procedures, there was never a forced evacuation communicated to anyone ... We have cyclone-rated buildings to a category 5, so this was actually the safest place to be&quot;. Rupert Greenhough from Hideaway Resorts said the island followed &quot;established cyclone procedures&quot;, which did not include provision for mass evacuation of staff.

Hideaway Resorts CEO Mark Campbell and Director Andrew Menzies flew by helicopter to Dunk Island on 3 February 2011 to assess the damage. Chairman Rupert Greenhough expressed relief that staff had survived the cyclone and described that outcome as a testament to the planning and preparations undertaken.

On 4 February 2011, staff, other than a skeleton team, were stood down until the resort was to be rebuilt, evacuated from the island by helicopters and water taxis, and offered counselling.

The Herald Sun reported that when management became aware that journalists were on the island, they were ushered away from staff and directed to speak to the island&#x27;s Melbourne-based co-owner and the manager of the resort.

On 5 February 2011, the Sunshine Coast Daily reported that statements purporting to cover Bedarra Resort released by management of Hideaway Resorts on 4 February 2011 actually referred to only its Dunk Island property that neighbours Bedarra Island.

====Dunk Island Resort infrastructure damage====
The damage to the resort was described as being very severe, with much of the resort needing to be completely rebuilt. The usually cyclone-hardy palm trees were stripped. The resort&#x27;s pool was filled with sand from the storm surge, the function hall was gutted, and the health centre was unroofed. Almost all of the beachfront apartments had their walls torn off. The gardens of the resort were stripped bare.

In July 2012, the general manager of the island, David Henry, advised that restoration work was proceeding slowly, and the re-opening of the resort was not expected for at least eighteen months. The campsites and associated amenities blocks were expected to re-open in September 2012.

In the event, restoration was continually delayed. In late 2019, it was announced that international investment conglomerate Mayfair 101, headed by James Mawhinney, had purchased Dunk Island for a reported $31.5m, and said it would rebuild the resort with significantly expanded facilities.

==In popular culture==
Dunk Island was the location for the 1969 film &quot;Age of Consent&quot;, which was based on a story by the artist and writer Norman Lindsay. Directed by Michael Powell, it starred James Mason as Bradley Morahan, a jaded Australian artist returning from New York, and Helen Mirren as Cora Ryan, a local teenager. &quot;Age of Consent&quot; attracted controversy over nudity and a sex scene, which led to some censorship and cuts. Much of the film was shot on the beach at Brammo Bay where ferries bringing visitors now dock.

An assignment in the penultimate round of the third season of the reality television show &quot;The Mole&quot; required the four remaining players to draw a rough map of Dunk Island. Contestants Marc Jongebloed and Bob Young won by submitting a drawing which roughly resembled the map of the island. One of the final scenes in James Cameron&#x27;s movie &quot;Sanctum&quot; was shot on Muggy Muggy beach.

<text>Richard Pohl (September 12, 1826 – December 17, 1896) was a German music critic, writer, poet, and amateur composer. He figured prominently in the mid-century War of the Romantics, taking the side opposite Eduard Hanslick, and championing the &quot;Music of the Future&quot; (the progressive Romantic style of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner).

Pohl was born in Leipzig. He studied physical sciences and philosophy before taking up writing and music criticism; he also acquired some early musical training. While in Leipzig, he became friends with Robert Schumann. Later, after a brief stint teaching at Graz, he moved to Dresden; there he worked on the &quot;Neue Musikzeitung&quot; between 1852 and 1854. During this period he became involved in the &quot;War of the Romantics,&quot; the vitriolic controversy between the relatively conservative branch of the Romantic movement, represented by Brahms, Mendelssohn and others, and the progressive &quot;Music of the Future&quot; trend exemplified by the music of Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz and especially by the music dramas of Richard Wagner. Pohl was solidly on the side of Wagner. The much more famous critic, Eduard Hanslick, championed Brahms from his post in Vienna as the critic for the prestigious &quot;Neue freie Presse&quot;.

In 1854 Pohl moved to Weimar, where he became an editor at the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;. He wrote invective-laden articles under the pseudonym &quot;Hoplit&quot; (from the Greek term hoplite, the foot-soldier of ancient Greece) in support of Liszt and Wagner, and critical of music of the more conservative Romantic composers.

While both Liszt and Wagner thanked him for his support, Wagner in particular cooled to Pohl in later years, especially after Pohl&#x27;s assertion that Wagner borrowed his chromatic harmonies in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; directly from Liszt.

Among Pohl&#x27;s other works was a novel based on the life of Richard Wagner.

He retired to Baden-Baden in 1864, and died there.

<doc id="1170189" wikidata="Q478382" url="?curid=1170189" title="Phase distortion synthesis">
<text>Phase distortion (PD) synthesis is a synthesis method introduced in 1984 by Casio in its CZ range of synthesizers. In outline, it is similar to phase modulation synthesis as championed by Yamaha Corporation (under the name of frequency modulation), in the sense that both methods dynamically change the harmonic content of a carrier waveform by influence of another waveform (modulator) in the time domain. However, the application and results of the two methods are quite distinct.

Casio made five different synthesizers using their original concept of PD synthesis (with variations). The later VZ-1 and co&#x27;s synthesis method Interactive phase distortion is much more similar to the aforementioned phase modulation, rather than a direct evolution of phase distortion; see below.

==Generating harmonic content==
Casio&#x27;s implementation of PD used oscillators generated by modulator and carrier waveforms, synchronised to each other per-cycle. The modulators were various angular waves that could &#x27;distort&#x27; the carrier&#x27;s sine into other shapes, to a degree derived from the &quot;DCW&quot; envelope. In doing so, many harmonics were created in the output. As modulators were rich in harmonic content, they could create spectra more linear, i.e. more similar to traditional subtractive spectra, than Yamaha&#x27;s phase modulation (PM/FM) synthesis. PM does not require oscillator sync but was for a long time limited to sine waves, which meant output spectra bore the non-linear hallmark of Bessel functions. PD is a different type of PM - whose very different modulators caused significant difference in operation and sound between PD and PM. Thus the two aren&#x27;t directly equivalent.

The phase transforms are all assembled from piecewise linear functions under binary logic control and shows characteristic sharp knees (and for some transforms, even sudden jumps) as they move from minimum to maximum, where the frequency counter&#x27;s accumulator wraps around and starts over. The sharp knees are smoothed by the roundness of the modulated sine wave and not too noticeable in the resulting signal.

== Simulating a resonant filter ==
As well as being more capable of generating traditional linear spectra, the CZ synthesizers can also emulate resonant filter sweeps. This was done using sine waves at the resonant frequency, synchronised and windowed at the fundamental frequency. Frequencies could be controlled but not resonance amount. 

Figure 19 from the 1985 CZ-series patent shows how to emulate the variable resonance found in analogue voltage-controlled filters:
* (a) The base frequency counter, wrapping around every period.
* (b) The resonance frequency counter at a slightly higher frequency, being reset (&quot;or &quot;synced&quot;&quot;) when the base counter wraps around.
* (c) The resonance frequency counter used as a sine wave readout. &quot;Note the sudden jump at the reset, which causes significant distortion.&quot;
* (d) The inverted base frequency counter.
* (e) Multiplying c by d. &quot;The sudden jump in&quot; c &quot;is now leveled out.&quot;

To summarize in other terms: The resonance is a form of digital hard sync, composed of a sine wave at the resonant frequency, amplitude enveloped by and hard-synced to a window function at the fundamental frequency. The window function can take various shapes, including sawtooth and triangle, thus determining the &#x27;basal&#x27; spectrum upon which the resonant effect is superimposed. Since the amplitude of all available window functions ends at zero, this removes sharp discontinuities in the synced sine wave, which is a well-known way to reduce aliasing in digital sync. However, some aliasing is still present due to discontinuities in the function&#x27;s derivatives. Thus, filter sweep effects are generated the same way as sync effects: by modulating the frequency of the resonance (DCW envelope), the timbre changes, adding and subtracting harmonics to/from the chosen fundamental spectrum around the chosen resonant frequency.

==Comparison to other types of synthesis==
As outlined above, phase distortion broadly applies similar mathematical concepts to phase modulation synthesis, but their implementation and results are not equivalent. Whereas PM - pioneered by John Chowning and commercially used by Yamaha - uses an oscillating modulator that can have its own period, PD applies an angular modulator of straight-line segments hard-synchronised to the same period as its corresponding carrier, i.e. modulating each cycle identically. PM/FM produces Bessel function-derived spectra unless linearised by the application of feedback, whereas PD produces more linear spectra. This manifests in PD synths&#x27; reputation for being easier to produce traditional subtractive sounds, such as those typically associated with analogue synths, which are characterised by linear spectra. These facts demonstrate how although the broad concept - alteration of phase - is the same, implementation and results differ greatly.

Casio&#x27;s own later engine named Interactive Phase Distortion (iPD), which featured in their VZ synths (VZ-1, VZ-10M, and VZ-8M; the first two also rebadged by Hohner as the HS-2 resp. HS-2/E), actually bears very little resemblance to &#x27;actual&#x27; PD, being based around an idiosyncratic type of PM instead. In iPD, multiple oscillators are combined in various configurable routings (similar to Yamaha&#x27;s &quot;algorithms&quot;) and can modulate each other using PM or ring modulation (the latter not available in Yamaha&#x27;s system). Casio&#x27;s options for combining and routing oscillators are more flexible than Yamaha&#x27;s.  For example, the VZ10-M is capable of 90 unique combinations of oscillators and modulations compared to the 32 algorithms of the DX7.  Additionally the VZ-10M oscillators offer 8 different waveforms, allowing more complex sound generation than the DX7 which uses only sine waves.

<text>is a tactical role-playing game developed by Tirnanog, a development studio started by Shouzou Kaga, the creator of the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, after he left Intelligent Systems&#x27; development team in 1999. The game featured a complicated development and initial release period, with the company receiving legal pressure multiple times from Nintendo, who felt that the game&#x27;s very similar gameplay and presentation, which also featured the art of &quot;Fire Emblem: Thracia 776&quot; artist Mayumi Hirota, infringed on their copyrights on their &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; intellectual property. Direct ties to &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; were dropped, and its original title, &quot;Emblem Saga&quot;, was changed to its final title as to not sound so similar to &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, and the game was released in Japan on May 24, 2001, by Enterbrain, for Nintendo&#x27;s competitor, Sony, on their PlayStation console. Three months after release, Nintendo took them to court over the game, and while Enterbrain was ordered to pay a fee, they ultimately retained the right to sell the game.

The game was viewed as a success, selling over 345,000 copies in its first three months of sale in Japan. The game was never released in any other regions officially, though a rough unofficial fan translation was created and released over a decade later in 2012, with a full translation being released on November 22, 2016. Kaga and Tirnanog went on to release a vastly overhauled sequel, &quot;Tear Ring Saga: Berwick Saga&quot;, in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, though the title sold less and was ultimately the last game for the company and series.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tear Ring Saga&quot; is a tactical RPG with gameplay very similar to the gameplay found in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series of video games. The game was created as a spiritual sequel to &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; by the game&#x27;s creator, Shouzou Kaga, who no longer had the rights to the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; intellectual property upon leaving Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. The game shares the same interface, graphical and music style, and overall gameflow. The game involves the player moving characters in a turn based fashion across a large grid from a top-down perspective. The player is tasked with certain objectives, commonly fighting and defeating an entire opposing faction, or a particular member or leader of a faction.

There are two protagonists in the game, Runan and Holmes, each with their own army to command. Though the two armies travel separately for the majority of the game, they cross paths at several points of the story, allowing the player to switch allocations of fighters and items amongst the two groups. Runan&#x27;s story follows a strict set of scenarios where he battles against an enemy empire, while Holmes&#x27; scenario allows for more freedom, allowing the player to ignore the main scenarios in favor of gathering treasure and increase the army&#x27;s strength.

==Plot==
The game takes place on an island continent called Riberia, which had long been divided and ruled under four kingdoms. However, these kingdoms were destroyed by the evil Zoa Empire and its devil-worshipping ruler, and the island was starting to regress into a period of instability and darkness. The Rīve Kingdom was one of the four kingdoms of Riberia, and the first protagonist, , is the prince of Razelia; one of the principalities within the kingdom. After the fall of his father&#x27;s principality, he escaped and went into hiding in a nearby port-town. This town also fell into the hands of the Empire, and Runan and , the prince of another one of the kingdom&#x27;s principalities, retreat to the newly created Uelt Kingdom with a small contingent of troops. The two receive assistance from the Uelt king, and begin a long journey to destroy the evil empire.

==Development and release==
The origins of the game&#x27;s development traces back to the creation of Nintendo and Intelligent Systems&#x27;s &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. The series was first created by Shouzou Kaga, who worked on the first five titles in the series, from 1990&#x27;s &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; to 1999&#x27;s &quot;Fire Emblem: Thracia 776&quot;. Upon the completion of the fifth title, Kaga decided to leave Intelligent Systems in order to work on games on his own. He founded a new company, Tirnanog in 2000, and shortly after announced their first title, the similarly titled &quot;Emblem Saga&quot;, for Nintendo&#x27;s market rival Sony on their PlayStation console. The game was initially announced for a March 2001 release, though the game was later delayed to May 24 in order to polish up the gameplay and add some new content. Prior to the game&#x27;s release, Tirnanog began receiving legal pressure from Nintendo, who were unhappy about making such an extremely similar game, in both name and concept, for their direct competitor, stating they felt that it &quot;was used deliberately for promotional purposes...bringing false recognition to users&quot;. This led to the team changing the name of the title to &quot;Tear Ring Saga&quot; and removing any direct references to &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; a month and a half prior to release.

While these initial changes allowed the game to be released as scheduled on May 24, 2001, Nintendo sued Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain for still infringing on game licenses and copyrights shortly after release in July. Nintendo sought for over 258.3 million yen in damages, (roughly equivalent to 2 million dollars at the time) and to prohibit sale and distribution of the game. The first trial ended in November 2002, where the Tokyo District Court turned down Nintendo&#x27;s claims. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit on appeal, and the second trial began three months after the first, this time under the Tokyo High Court. The second trial ended in November 2004, and Enterbrain was ordered to pay a fine of 76 million yen to Nintendo. However, the game was not ruled as a breach of copyright, and copies remained in stores. Nintendo and Intelligent Systems made another appeal to the Japanese Supreme Court, where the second ruling was upheld.

The game was released on May 24, 2001 in Japan. The game was never officially translated into English, due to the legal battles and being released late in the lifespan of the PlayStation, though a rough unofficial fan translation was released in English in 2012. Two official game guides were released in June and July 2001, both by Enterbrain. A novelized version of the game has also been released by &quot;Famitsu Bunko&quot; in 4 volumes between 2001 and 2006 (the release of the final volume was prolonged for over a year due to the lawsuit by Nintendo). The game&#x27;s soundtrack was released in a two disc set by Scitron on June 20, 2001.

==Reception==
On release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; praised the game for successfully emulating the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; formula, stating that &quot;for a clone, it&#x27;s exceptionally well done, and the 32-bit graphics of the PlayStation look significantly better than any of the 2D entries in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series&quot;. &quot;RPGFan&quot; praised the game&#x27;s soundtrack, favorably comparing it to Hitoshi Sakimoto&#x27;s music for &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, though conceding that they thought a game released so late in the PlayStation&#x27;s life cycle would take better advantage of the system&#x27;s sound system, nor did they approve of the game&#x27;s vocal theme song.

The game was viewed as a success, selling more than 345,000 copies by July 2001.

==Legacy== 
Kaga and Tirnanog&#x27;s legal victory allowing them the release of the game despite its obvious similarities to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, was seen as setting a precedent for it being acceptable for original creators to make very similar spiritual sequels without the consent or involvement from their original parent companies. &quot;USGamer&quot; cited the victory as reason as to why future similar situations were allowed, such as Bungie leaving Microsoft and &quot;Halo&quot; series behind in order to release the similar &quot;Destiny&quot;, and Keiji Inafune leaving Capcom and the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series in order to create the similar &quot;Mighty No. 9&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; similarly compared the situation to Koji Igarashi creating a &quot;Castlevania&quot; spiritual sequel with &quot;&quot; after leaving Konami. The legal proceedings with the game is also suspected to be the reason for why Nintendo&#x27;s proposed entry to the series around the time, &quot;Fire Emblem 64&quot;, was eventually cancelled.

Four years after the original release, the game received another Japanese-only entry, a sequel titled . The sequel was released for the PlayStation 2 on May 26, 2005. While it still largely played as a tactical RPG, the game featured fundamental differences from the first game, including character movement operating on a hexagonal layout instead of a square grid, being able to temporarily recruit mercenaries by interacting with them, and being able to recruit them permanently if certain criteria are met. &quot;Berwick Saga&quot; debuted at no. 2 on the Japanese weekly charts, but sold far less than its predecessor, selling only 84,000 copies at the end of its first week. Analysts suggest the dip in sales was due to launching at the same week as a number of other Japanese titles, including &quot;Namco X Capcom&quot;, &quot;SD Gundam G Generation DS&quot; and &quot;Hanjuku Hero IV&quot;. The game was well received, with Tim Rogers of &quot;Kotaku&quot; listing it as an honorable mention in their list of the best PlayStation 2 games of all time, stating that it was &quot;probably the best tactical strategy RPG [he] ever had the pleasure of playing&quot;. Despite this, it would be the last game in the series. Kaga took a hiatus after the release of the game, lasting a decade until the production and release of &quot;Vestaria Saga&quot; in 2016, the first game in a new series of tactical RPGs.

<text>Christopher Karlton Gwynn (born October 13, 1964) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder. He is the younger brother of Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn and the uncle of former Major League Baseball outfielder Tony Gwynn Jr.

== Early Life ==
Gwynn was born in Los Angeles, California and raised in Long Beach, California.

==Career==
The California Angels drafted Gwynn in the fifth round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. However, Gwynn did not sign with the Angels, opting to attend San Diego State University, where he played college baseball for the San Diego State Aztecs baseball team. Gwynn played for the United States national baseball team in the 1984 Summer Olympics, winning a silver medal.

Gwynn was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first round (tenth overall) of the 1985 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his MLB debut in 1987. While with the Dodgers, Gwynn made the final out in Dennis Martínez&#x27;s perfect game on July 28, 1991. After that season, the Dodgers traded Gwynn with minor leaguer Domingo Mota to the Kansas City Royals for Todd Benzinger. He played two seasons with the Kansas City Royals (1992–1993). Gwynn signed with the Dodgers as a free agent after the 1993 season, and he played with them in 1994 and 1995. He joined his older brother Tony on the San Diego Padres for his final season in 1996.

On September 29, 1996, in the final game of the season, Gwynn hit what would prove to be the game-winning, two-run, pinch-hit double in the top of the 11th inning against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park to complete a three-game sweep of the Dodgers and clinch the Padres&#x27; second National League West division championship in team history. It was the final regular season at bat of his career, however he also pinch-hit in each of the first two games of the subsequent Divisional series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, garnering hits in both of those at bats, ending his career on a 3-for-3 streak. Gwynn hit two pinch-hit walk-off home runs during his career.

In a 10-year career spanning 599 games, Gwynn posted a .261 batting average (263-for-1007) with 119 runs, 17 home runs and 118 RBI. An excellent outfielder playing at all three outfield positions and several games at first base, he committed only one error in 382 total chances for a .997 fielding percentage. His only miscue in the majors occurred on September 28, 1993, as a member of the Kansas City Royals against the Cleveland Indians.

==Post-playing career==
Gwynn became a scout for the Padres once his playing career ended. In 2011, he was the Director of Player Personnel for the Padres. After the 2011 season, Gwynn became the Director of Player Development for the Seattle Mariners. He lives in California with his wife JoAnn, his son and his daughter.

<text>Ernie Hardeman (born December 4, 1947) is a Canadian politician who served as Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs from 2018 to 2021 in the Doug Ford government and as Minister of Agriculture and Food from 1999 to 2001 in the Mike Harris government. He represents the rural riding of Oxford for the Progressive Conservative Party. Upon his re-election in 2025, with the retirement of Ted Arnott, he became the longest serving member of Ontario Provincial Parliament

==Background==
Hardeman was the owner and operator of &quot;Hardeman Feed Limited&quot;, established in Salford, Ontario, from 1966 to 1995. Hardeman&#x27;s nephew, John Vanthof, is a current sitting MPP for the New Democratic Party and behind his uncle in the legislature.

==Politics==
He served as mayor of the Township of Southwest Oxford from 1988 to 1994. He was chair of the &quot;Wardens&#x27; Association of Ontario&quot; in 1990–91, and served as a board member on the Association of Municipalities of Ontario.

Hardeman was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent New Democrat Kimble Sutherland by about 8000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris won the election, and Hardeman was a government backbench supporter for the next four years. In 1996, he was commissioned by the government to conduct a survey on the possible amalgamation of Hamilton, Ontario into a united municipality.

He was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election. He was appointed to cabinet by Mike Harris as Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on June 17, 1999. As Minister, he replaced agricultural offices with the Agricultural Information Contact Centre. He was removed from cabinet on February 7, 2001. On February 25, 2003, he returned to cabinet under Ernie Eves in the new position of Associate Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, with Responsibility for Rural Affairs.

Hardeman was re-elected in the 2003 election. He supported Jim Flaherty&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the Progressive Conservative party&#x27;s leadership in 2004. On June 13, 2005, Hardeman&#x27;s private members bill, &quot;Farm Implements Amendment Act&quot;, received third reading and royal assent.

In 2007 Hardeman was re-elected for a fourth consecutive term. He served as Deputy House Leader and was then promoted to Chair of the Standing Committee on Government Agencies. He is also the PC critic for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

On June 16, 2008, Hardeman introduced a private member&#x27;s bill which allows farmers to post seasonal, directional signage along provincial highways to advertise their Ontario grown produce and direct consumers to the farm. The bill was supported by many agricultural groups and unanimously passed first, second and third reading. On December 10, 2008, &quot;Signage to Promote Ontario Produced Agricultural Products Act&quot; received royal assent and became law.

<text>Blender was an American music magazine published from 1994 to 2009 that billed itself as &quot;the ultimate guide to pop culture&quot;. It was also known for sometimes steamy pictorials of celebrities. It compiled lists of albums, artists, and songs, including both &quot;best of&quot; and &quot;worst of&quot; lists. In each issue, there was a review of an artist&#x27;s entire discography, with each album being analyzed in turn.

&quot;Blender&quot; was published by Dennis Publishing. The magazine was created by founding Editor-in-Chief Regina Joseph as the first digital magazine, delivered entirely on CD-ROM disc and before the development of graphical browsers required to view the web. She brought in co-founders Jason Pearson and David Cherry, and Blender&#x27;s original publisher, Felix Dennis/Dennis Publishing, UK. Joseph&#x27;s CD-ROM editions of Blender also featured the first forms of digital advertising. Felix Dennis published 15 digital CD issues, and launched a web version in 1996. The final CD-ROM issue was published in June 1997, issue 14. Dennis started publishing a print edition again in 1999 which became the final distribution format of the title. Blender CD-ROM showcased the earliest digital editorial formats, as well as the first forms of digital advertising. The first digital advertisers included SonicNet, Time-Life/Philips, Calvin Klein, Apple Computer, Toyota and Nike.

In June 2006, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named it one of the top ten English-language magazines, describing it as &quot;the cool kid at the school of rock magazines&quot;.

Owner Alpha Media Group closed &quot;Blender&quot; March 26, 2009, going to an online-only format in a move that eliminated 30 jobs and reduced the company&#x27;s portfolio of titles to &quot;Maxim&quot; alone. &quot;Blender&quot; final print issue was the April 2009 issue. Subscribers to the magazine were sent issues of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine to make up for the unsent &quot;Blender&quot; issues.

== Indian edition ==
The Indian edition of &quot;Blender&quot; was the title&#x27;s first venture outside the United States. It commenced publication with its May 2008 issue, which featured Mariah Carey on the cover. The magazine was targeted at educated male city dwellers aged between 18 and 34. The magazine was launched through Dennis Media Transasia India, a joint venture between Dennis Publishing and Media Transasia, which also publishes the Asian versions of &quot;Blender&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot;. The joint venture was based in New Delhi with offices in Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai.

<doc id="1170211" wikidata="Q6666399" url="?curid=1170211" title="Lodi (Pashtun tribe)">
<text>Lodi (Pashto; لودهی) is a Pashtun tribe from the Bettani group of Pashtuns. In mythical genealogy, they have also been considered as being part of the Bettani tribal confederacy. The Lodi tribe consists of many sub-tribes, most of whom are now settled in the Tank, Frontier Region Tank, Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of modern-day Pakistan. These tribes were nomadic for most of their existence and migrated to their present-day locations by crossing the Gomal Pass throughout different times in history.

Two tribes among the Lodi ended up establishing their own empires, the Sur tribe established the Sur Empire and the Prangi tribe established the Lodi Dynasty.

== Lohani ==
Lohani, also known as Nuhani, is the largest sub-group among the Lodi tribe. The Lohani migrated and crossed the Gomal Pass en masse during the late 1500s, into present-day Lodi territory and displaced other Lodi tribes such as Sur and Prangi that had settled in the region in prior times. Although other Lohani tribes had also made earlier deeper incursions into India, as far as Bihar, and settled therein during the days of the Lodi dynasty.

=== Earliest mentions of the Lohani ===
The earliest mention of the Lohani tribes comes in the form of an inscription written on a tablet from 1496 AD in Bihar during the days of the Lodi dynasty. The inscription records the construction of a certain gate by Darya Khan Nuhani who is thereafter mentioned as one of the &quot;governors of the kingdom&quot;. The Lohani tribes were also mentioned by the Mughal Emperor Babur in his memoirs, the Baburnama, as Nuhani Afghans around 1529 AD. The earliest records mentions them as &quot;Nuhani&quot; rather than &quot;Lohani&quot;, which is the primary designation by which they are currently known today.

<doc id="1170226" wikidata="Q16829386" url="?curid=1170226" title="Department of Immigration and Border Protection">
<text>The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) was a department of the Government of Australia that was responsible for immigration, citizenship and border control (including visa issuance). It has now been subsumed into the Department of Home Affairs, which combines its responsibilities with a number of other portfolios.

The final head of department was Secretary Michael Pezzullo, who reported to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Peter Dutton and the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Alex Hawke MP.

==History==
The Department of Immigration and Border Protection was formed by way of an Administrative Arrangements Order issued on 18 September 2013 and replaced the majority of the functions previously performed by the former Department of Immigration and Citizenship; with the exception of most settlement and multicultural affairs programs that were assumed by the Department of Human Services. Additionally, the Australian Border Force and associated policy was assumed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (previously managed under the authority of the Attorney-General&#x27;s portfolio, a move intended to ensure stronger integration of border protection resources.

Following Federation in 1901, immigration to Australia was handled by the Department of External Affairs. In 1916 responsibility shifted to the newly created Department of Home and Territories. Migration was handled from 1928 until 1932 by a recreated Department of Home Affairs and from 1932 until 1945 by the Department of the Interior, except that between January 1925 and January 1928 Victor Wilson and Thomas Paterson were Ministers for Markets and Migration.

In July 1945, the Department of Immigration was established as Australia launched a massive immigration program following World War II. The then Minister for Immigration, Arthur Calwell promoted mass immigration with the slogan &quot;populate or perish&quot;. Since 1945, the department&#x27;s names, functions and responsibilities have changed several times.

The present departmental title, Department of Home Affairs, refers to a combined department covering law enforcement, national and transport security, criminal justice, emergency management, multicultural affairs and immigration and border control. Departmental writing guide mandates the use of &quot;Home Affairs&quot; as a shortened form of the Department&#x27;s name. DHA is exclusively used by Defence Housing Australia.

Over the years, the department has been the centre of controversy in regards to the Australian Government&#x27;s policies of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals, the Pacific Solution, and the treatment of asylum seekers that was criticised in the Palmer Inquiry reports in 2005.

The Rudd Labor government announced the end of mandatory detention in Australia in July 2008, unless the asylum seeker was deemed to pose a risk to the wider community, such as those who have repeatedly breached their visa conditions or those who have security or health risks.

On 1 July 2015, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal became divisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

==Operational activities==
In an Administrative Arrangements Order made on 18 September 2013, the functions of the department were broadly classified into the following matters:

*Entry, stay and departure arrangements for non-citizens
*Border immigration control
*Citizenship
*Ethnic affairs
*Customs and border control other than quarantine and inspection

===Migration program===

The size and composition of Australia&#x27;s permanent migration program is reviewed annually to maximise its potential. The 2010–11 migration program was set at 168,700 places—an overall total which was unchanged from 2009 to 2010. Within this total, the skill stream was allocated 113 850 places to address current and emerging skill shortages in critical occupations and regions. The family stream was set at 54 550 places, recognising the benefits that accrue when Australians have their parents, partners, carers or children join them to live in Australia permanently.

On 1 July 2010, a new skilled occupation list was introduced for the general skilled migration. A new points test emphasising the importance of English language proficiency, work experience and higher level qualifications was announced and implemented on 1 July 2011. In addition, state migration plans were implemented for each state and territory to provide greater flexibility for state and territory governments to nominate skilled migrants in a broader range of occupations specific to their skill shortage needs than are currently offered through the skilled occupation list.

According to the 2014-15 migration program, 68 per cent are skilled migrants and 32 per cent are from family visa streams.

===Humanitarian program===
Australia is within the top three humanitarian resettlement countries in the world. Under the humanitarian program, the department granted 13,799 visas in 2010–11. Of these, 8971 were granted offshore and 4828 were granted onshore. The Woman at Risk target of 12 per cent of refugee grants (720 grants) was exceeded, with 759 visas granted.

The introduction of complementary protection legislation into parliament on 24 February 2011, was a development in relation to Australia&#x27;s commitment to fulfilling its international obligations under the Refugee Convention. This was expected to improve the efficiency of decision-making by providing more accountable assessments of asylum seekers’ protection claims.

===Citizenship===

The department&#x27;s citizenship course provides an alternative pathway for taking the final step towards becoming an Australian citizen. In 2010–11, 27 citizenship courses were delivered across metropolitan and regional areas in Australia, and about 74,000 citizenship tests were administered globally during the year.

On 26 January 2011, Australia Day, approximately 13,000 people became Australian citizens in about 325 citizenship ceremonies hosted by local councils and community groups across the country. Brisbane City Council, despite the devastating floods, hosted the largest Australia Day 2011 citizenship ceremony with more than 1,000 people becoming citizens at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre.

===Border security===
The department collects biometrics to help verify the identity of visa applicants in any future visa encounters. From December 2010, biometrics began to be collected across 15 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. This initiative was undertaken in collaboration with the predecessor of UK Visas and Immigration.

===Immigration detention===
A new immigration detention services group was established in 2011 to implement policy, manage contractors and coordinate detention operations.

<text>Remensa (Catalan: &quot;Remença&quot;) was a Catalan mode of serfdom. Those who were serfs under this mode are properly &quot;pagesos de remença&quot; (&quot;pagesos&quot; meaning &quot;peasants&quot;); they are often (though not quite correctly) referred to simply as &quot;remences&quot; (singular &quot;remença&quot;).

The Catalan term &quot;remença&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;redementia&quot; and emphasizes the possibility of redemption from servitude.

The severity of this way of life led to rebellions by the remensa peasants in 1462 and 1485 known as the War of the Remences. After the second revolt, King Ferdinand II of Aragon issued the &quot;Sentencia de Guadalupe&quot; (1486), outlawing the more severe abuses of the oppressive evil customs and allowing remensa peasants to be redeemed by a payment of 60 sous per household, leaving a rural society that was still feudal in character, but significantly reformed.

<text>Theta Chi () is an international men&#x27;s college fraternity. It was founded on April 10, 1856, at Norwich University then-located in Norwich, Vermont, and has initiated more than 215,000 members and currently has over 8,900 collegiate members across North America.

==History==

===Founding and early years at Norwich===

Theta Chi was founded on April 10, 1856, at Norwich University in Norwich, Vermont, by two military cadets, Frederick Norton Freeman and Arthur Chase. A third man, Egbert Phelps, is considered to be the &quot;Assistant Founder&quot; for lending his help and advice to Freeman and Chase after transferring to Union College in 1854 (he was a member of Chi Psi Fraternity). The first initiates after the founders were Edward Bancroft Williston and Lorenzo Potter, both initiated on .

Theta Chi&#x27;s early history is closely connected to the history of Norwich University. In 1866, a massive fire devastated the university, completely destroying the Old South Barracks, where the Fraternity had been founded. This disaster prompted the university to move from Norwich, Vermont to its present location in Northfield, Vermont. In 1873 the university nearly closed due to financial reasons, however brother Charles Dole (1869), then serving as a professor at the university, met all of the university&#x27;s financial obligations from his own pocket, saving the institution. In the fall of 1881, Norwich University was reduced to only 12 students and Theta Chi&#x27;s membership was reduced to one collegiate member, James M. Holland (1883). In November of that year, Phil S. Randall (1886) and Henry B. Hersey (1885) approached Holland and insisted that they be allowed to join Theta Chi; Holland agreed, which saved the Fraternity from extinction.

===Growth===

With the help of brother Charles Dole, who was serving in the Vermont State Legislature, Theta Chi was formally incorporated under the laws of Vermont on , and acquired its first chapter house in 1890. There were early efforts to expand Theta Chi to both Dartmouth College and Union College, but the anti-expansion sentiment among members of the Alpha chapter and unstable conditions at the university forced it to remain a single entity for 46 years. However, on , the &quot;Beta chapter&quot; was installed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after brother Park Valentine Perkins (1905) transferred there from Norwich and petitioned Alpha chapter for a charter. A Grand Chapter was organized in 1908 to direct the Fraternity and promote its growth.

On , Theta Chi&#x27;s chapters merged with Beta Kappa with the exception of the chapter at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, which chose to become a chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha. The merger brought 16 new collegiate chapters and over 6,000 collegiate and alumnus members into the ranks. Unlike other men&#x27;s college fraternity mergers, Beta Kappa was completely absorbed into Theta Chi with no changes to the name or ritual. 

The Foundation Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity, Inc. was established in 1953 as a charity to provide educational scholarships and assistance. In 1965, the Zeta Gamma chapter was installed at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, making Theta Chi an international fraternity.

==Ideals, traditions, and symbols==
The Greek motto of Theta Chi is &quot;Θηρόποσα Χείρ&quot;, which is translated as &quot;An Assisting Hand.&quot; Theta Chi&#x27;s motto was secret from the founding in 1856 until the 1930s, at which time it was made public and incorporated into the Fraternity&#x27;s Coat of Arms.

When Freeman and Chase founded Theta Chi in 1856 they very clearly spelled out the purpose of the Fraternity in the original Constitution. Article I stated that the objects of Theta Chi were to &quot;bind by closer bonds the members to each other and the mutual assistance of each of its members;&quot; &quot;the advancement and carrying out of any measures at the institution in which it shall be established which shall be of importance to its members,&quot; and &quot;the mutual benefit and improvement of all its members.&quot; The Fraternity continues to guard certain secrets about membership.

The Fraternity&#x27;s colors are military red and white. Its flower is the red carnation. The national alumni publication is &quot;The Rattle&quot;, named for the rattlesnake that appears on the Fraternity&#x27;s Coat of Arms and Badge. It has become a Theta Chi tradition to celebrate Founders Day on April 10, usually as an alumni gathering.

===Maxim===
The Fraternity&#x27;s maxim is &quot;Alma Mater First and Theta Chi for Alma Mater,&quot; and refers to one of the founding ideals of the Fraternity: loyalty to one&#x27;s college or university over the course of one&#x27;s lifetime.

===Badge===
The Badge of Theta Chi consists of a rattlesnake in the shape of the Greek letter &quot;theta&quot; and two swords which form the letter &quot;chi.&quot; All badges are gold with the eye of the rattlesnake containing a ruby. Egbert Phelps, Theta Chi&#x27;s &quot;Assistant Founder&quot;, designed the original Badge sometime before the founding date. Freeman ordered the first badges from a Boston jeweler on April 12, 1856, and they were first worn on June 9, 1856.
===Coat of Arms===
The Coat of Arms official description in heraldic phraseology goes as the following: &quot;Or, on a bend gules, a nowed serpent between two swords, points downwards, palewise all the first. On an esquire&#x27;s helmet the Crest, an eagle displayed or.&quot; The true meaning of the coat of arms is known only to brothers of the fraternity.

According to &quot;The Manual of Theta Chi&quot;, the original design for the Coat of Arms was suggested by Freeman, and members of Alpha chapter used his ideas to develop an official image. The Coat of Arms has undergone over a dozen modifications since, with the current design being approved in 1939.

==Creed==
Frank Schrenk (Kappa/Pennsylvania 1915) wrote the Creed of Theta Chi. It is both an affirmation of the founding principles of Theta Chi and a mission statement for the Fraternity:

==Monument==
On August 29, 1931, the day of Theta Chi&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Convention, a stone monument was dedicated at Norwich, Vermont. The Monument of Theta Chi is a remembrance of the founding of Theta Chi Fraternity. The inscription appears as follows:

==Theta Chi today==
Theta Chi currently has 150 active chapters and seven colonies across the United States and Canada and has initiated over 215,000 members since its founding.

Theta Chi Fraternity&#x27;s collegiate members are involved on their respective campuses with a multitude of leadership organizations, including Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK), the Order of Omega, Student Government Association (SGA), Phi Beta Kappa, Florida Blue Key, and NCAA athletics.

Theta Chi&#x27;s preferred philanthropies are the United Service Organizations (USO), Wounded Warrior Project, the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network, the American Red Cross, Relay for Life, The Kyle Charvat Foundation, and Habitat for Humanity. Theta Chi is one of the largest donating organizations to the United Service Organizations (USO).

==Local chapter or member misconduct==
In 1997, Binaya Oja died participating in a drinking pledging ritual at Clarkson University. Pledges were to drink until they vomited. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the fraternity.

In 2008, Harrison Kowiak suffered a fatal injury while playing a capture-the-flag-like game as part of initiation at Lenoir–Rhyne University. In his family&#x27;s wrongful death lawsuit filed against the fraternity, it was reported Kowiak&#x27;s head struck the concrete when he was tackled.

In 2012, Philip Dhanens died due to alcohol poisoning after drinking 37 shots of hard liquor with his fellow pledge brothers at Fresno State University. Three Theta Chi members were arrested and charged for his death following the incident, and as of 2020 the chapter is still inactive.

In 2018, a Theta Chi member and student died due to alcohol poisoning at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The organization was disbanded from the university.

In 2018, a Theta Chi pledge at Drake University sued the fraternity on the local and national levels after a hazing drinking incident left him near death.

In 2019, a Theta Chi member at the University of Arizona sued for medical expenses and severe loss of eye sight after a hazing incident on April 12, 2019. In the claim the pledge cited being beaten and forced to exercise on broken glass while members played loud Nazi music and beat the pledges. During this period a glass of habanero sauce was thrown into the pledge&#x27;s eyes where he suffered chemical burns, chemosis, and a corneal abrasion.
In February 2021, a petition with over 10,000 signatures to suspend the Theta Chi chapter at the University of Massachusetts Amherst emerged after the fraternity hosted several large parties, which were allegedly the cause of higher numbers of COVID cases on the UMass campus. The chapter was put on an interim suspension, but no other punishments were given out.

In October 2021, the Theta Chi chapter at the University of Massachusetts Amherst was the center of a student protest after claims that a female student was drugged and raped at a party circulated on various social media platforms. A protest that attracted a crowd of over 300 students turned violent when car windows were broken and a resident of the Theta Chi house was hit with a bottle. Another petition that had over 30,000 signatures pushed administration to suspend the chapter, but the chancellor at the time, Kumble Subbaswamy, said without an official complaint or report, there was no way for them to properly investigate the incidents.

In December 2022, the Theta Chi chapter and school at Rutgers University–New Brunswick was sued by a freshman who was allegedly forced into drinking life-threatening amounts of alcohol as a pledge and fell down several flights of stairs which resulted being hospitalized with severe injuries. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, the letters on the housing for the Theta Chi chapter were taken down.

<text>Julia Livilla ( – ) was the youngest child of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder and the youngest sister of the Emperor Caligula.

==Life==
Julia Livilla was the youngest great-granddaughter of Emperor Augustus, great-niece and adoptive granddaughter of the Emperor Tiberius, sister of the Emperor Caligula, niece of the Emperor Claudius, and through her eldest sister Agrippina the Younger, maternal aunt of the Emperor Nero. In most ancient literary sources, on inscriptions and on coins, she is simply called &quot;Julia&quot;. It is possible that she dropped the use of her cognomen after the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; of her paternal aunt Livilla (sister of Germanicus and Claudius) after whom she was named. However, on her sepulchral inscription, she is explicitly named &quot;Livilla, daughter of Germanicus&quot;, which suggests that in her time she was called either &quot;Julia&quot; or &quot;Livilla&quot;.
She was born on Lesbos, one of the many Greek islands during her parents&#x27; grand tour of the eastern Mediterranean, leading Germanicus to his command base in the imperial province of Syria for the &quot;maius imperium&quot; given to him by Tiberius over the territory east of the Adriatic Sea. As a young child, she was with her mother and brother Caligula when they returned to Rome after Germanicus&#x27; untimely death in Antioch in 19 AD.

Julia Livilla grew up in the household of her great-grandmother Livia and later under the care of her paternal grandmother Antonia Minor. She was first betrothed to a distant cousin, Publius Quinctilius Varus the Younger, son of the ill-fated governor of Germania, Publius Quinctilius Varus, and of Claudia Pulchra, grandniece of Augustus, but after Quinctillius was charged of &quot;maiestas&quot; in 27, the marriage did not occur. In 33, she married Marcus Vinicius. Vinicius&#x27; family came from a small town outside of Rome. He descended from a family of the &quot;equites&quot; class and his father and grandfather had served as consuls. Her husband was mild in character and was an elaborate orator. Vinicius was appointed by Tiberius as a commissioner in early 37. He was also consul in 30 and proconsul of Asia in 38/39. According to an inscription, Julia Livilla may have accompanied her husband in Asia during his proconsulship.

During the first years of Caligula&#x27;s reign, Livilla, along with her elder sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Drusilla, received considerable honours and striking privileges, such as the rights of the Vestal Virgins (like the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium), the inclusion of her name in the oath of loyalty to the emperor and her depiction on coins. Although seeming to experience an eventful and privileged court life, she was under full control of her brother, and, according to Suetonius, she, along with Agrippina, was prostituted by her brother to his catamites. Ancient writers even report gossip of incestuous relationships between Caligula and his sisters, including Livilla.

In 39, Livilla was involved in an unsuccessful conspiracy (led perhaps by Agrippina) to overthrow Caligula and to replace him with his brother-in-law Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Drusilla&#x27;s widower, but also alleged lover of Agrippina and Livilla). Livilla and her sister Agrippina the Younger were banished to the Pontine Islands (they were most likely separated in their exile and each one sent to a different island). After the deaths of Caligula, his fourth wife Milonia Caesonia, and their daughter Julia Drusilla, she returned from exile on the orders of the new emperor, Livilla&#x27;s paternal uncle Claudius. Later in 41, she fell out of favour with Messalina (Claudius&#x27;s third wife) and was charged by her paternal uncle Claudius for having adultery with Seneca the Younger. Both were exiled. She was most likely sent to Ventotene. Political considerations may have played a role in Julia Livilla&#x27;s fate, more than just moral or domestic preoccupations as inferred in the ancient sources. In late 41 or early 42, her uncle ordered her execution, apparently by starvation, without a defense and on unsupported charges. She was executed around the same time as her cousin Julia Livia, the daughter of her aunt Livilla. Her remains were later brought back to Rome, probably when Agrippina became Empress; they were laid to rest in the Mausoleum of Augustus.

The sepulchral inscription found on her cippus reads: &quot;Livilla, daughter of Germanicus, lies here&quot; (&quot;LIVILLA GERMANICI CAESARIS FILIA HIC SITA EST&quot;). A rich and precious vase found near this cippus is believed to have contained Livilla&#x27;s ashes.

==Cultural depictions==
*In &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot;, the novels by Robert Graves, Livilla is called &#x27;Lesbia&#x27;, a name alluding to the island where she was born. She was almost omitted from the television adaptation, there was just a brief mention of Caligula having three sisters at one point, and another brief mention of two sisters just before his assassination.
* In the 1968 British television series &quot;The Caesars&quot; Julia Livilla was portrayed by Jenny White. 
* In the 2019 &quot;Roman Empire&quot; season 3: Caligula: The Mad Emperor, Julia Livilla was played by New Zealand actress Molly Leishman.

<text>David Douglas Garrard (born February 14, 1978) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons. He played college football for the East Carolina Pirates and was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fourth round of the 2002 NFL draft. Garrard spent nine seasons with the Jaguars, leading them to their first playoff win since 1999 in 2007. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2009. He also spent time with the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets.

==Early life==
Garrard was born in East Orange, New Jersey and grew up in Durham, North Carolina. When he was fourteen his mother died of breast cancer. When he began his professional career he created The David Garrard Foundation to promote breast cancer awareness and research.

Garrard attended Southern High School in Durham, where he was named an All-America choice by Prep Stars and rated the best high school quarterback in North Carolina. Veteran high school coaches in North Carolina said Garrard possessed one of the strongest arms they had ever seen and compared Garrard to former NFL quarterback and North Carolina native Roman Gabriel.

==College career==
Garrard attended East Carolina University, where he played for the East Carolina Pirates football team. Although physically larger than most quarterbacks at more than 240 pounds, Garrard displayed exceptional mobility. Former East Carolina head football coach Steve Logan compared the experience of tackling Garrard to &quot;getting hit by a beer truck.&quot; Garrard also proved durable, starting every game for the Pirates in the 1999, 2000, and 2001 seasons.

In Garrard&#x27;s sophomore season, he led the Pirates to a 9–3 record with victories over the West Virginia Mountaineers, South Carolina Gamecocks, Miami Hurricanes, and North Carolina State Wolfpack. In the fourth game of the season against Miami, East Carolina came back from a 20–3 deficit to defeat the 13th-ranked Miami Hurricanes, 27–23. Garrard threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Keith Stokes for the go-ahead score in the final minutes of the game. ECU was unable to play the scheduled home game at Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium on its campus in Greenville, NC, because Hurricane Floyd had ravaged the eastern part of the state the prior week. The hurricane also prevented the Pirates from returning to Greenville following a road victory against South Carolina, leaving ECU&#x27;s football team stranded in Columbia, SC. East Carolina moved the game against Miami to Carter–Finley Stadium in Raleigh. The victory propelled ECU into the Associated Press college football poll&#x27;s top 25. The Pirates spent eleven weeks ranked in the AP poll, climbed to as high as 16th in the poll, and finished the regular season ranked 20th. East Carolina dropped out of the top 25 to 27th in the voting after losing 28–14 in the 1999 Mobile Alabama Bowl to Texas Christian University and the Horned Frogs&#x27; star running back, LaDainian Tomlinson.

ECU finished 8–4 in Garrard&#x27;s junior season. Garrard capped the season by throwing an unbelievable touchdown and rushing for another acrobatic touchdown in a 40–27 victory against Texas Tech in the Galleryfurniture.com Bowl. Garrard&#x27;s senior season began with high expectations but ended in disappointment. Although East Carolina averaged more than 35 points per game in 2001, the Pirates finished the season with a 6–6 record.

Ironically, the final game of Garrard&#x27;s college career pitted him against Marshall University and its starting quarterback, Byron Leftwich, in the 2001 GMAC Bowl. Garrard and Leftwich would eventually be teammates with the Jacksonville Jaguars and compete for the team&#x27;s starting quarterback position. In the highest-scoring bowl game in college football history to that point, Leftwich brought Marshall back from a thirty-point deficit to defeat Garrard&#x27;s East Carolina Pirates 64–61 in double-overtime.

Garrard broke 28 school passing and offensive records at East Carolina and joined a select few quarterbacks who achieved more than 9000 passing yards and 1000 rushing yards in their collegiate careers.

Garrard went on to graduate from East Carolina University in 2001 with a degree in Construction Management.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Jacksonville Jaguars===

Garrard was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the fourth round, with the 108th overall pick, of the 2002 draft . Head coach Tom Coughlin saw him as the eventual successor to starting quarterback Mark Brunell. Coughlin however was fired following the 2002 season, and the team drafted quarterback Byron Leftwich with the seventh overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft. Leftwich replaced an injured Brunell midway through the 2003 season, and Garrard continued to serve as the team&#x27;s backup.

Garrard was diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease in January 2004, and underwent treatment. Despite having surgery to remove a nearly 12-inch portion of his intestines in June, Garrard was healthy to start the 2004 season. His only start of the season came in Week 9 against Detroit when Leftwich was injured; he threw two touchdowns to zero interceptions, with his second touchdown coming in overtime to win the game.

In week 12 of the 2005 season, Leftwich was injured on the first play of the game and ruled out the rest of the regular season. Garrard led the Jaguars on a 5–1 run through their final six games to secure a playoff berth. 
He threw for 1,117 yards, 4 touchdowns, 1 interception for an 83.9 quarterback rating, and his lone loss came against the then–undefeated Indianapolis Colts. Leftwich then returned as the starter for the AFC Wild Card game, in which the Jaguars suffered a 28–3 loss to the New England Patriots.
In 2006, Garrard was named the starter in Week 8 and replaced Leftwich for the remainder of the season. Through his first seven games as starter, Garrard led Jacksonville to a 5–2 record, leading to speculation that the Jaguars might seek to replace Leftwich permanently with Garrard. He lost his final three starts however, and the Jaguars missed the playoffs.

Entering the 2007 season, Jack Del Rio attempted to avoid a quarterback controversy by naming Leftwich the team&#x27;s unconditional starting quarterback. However, Garrard outplayed Leftwich in the preseason, and Del Rio named him the starting quarterback on August 31, 2007. The Jaguars released Leftwich the next day.

In his first season as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback, Garrard led the Jaguars to a 10–2 record and threw for 18 touchdowns and 2,509 yards in 12 games (he missed 3 games with a sprained ankle and sat out the season finale with the rest of their starters). He threw just three interceptions on the year, which gave him a quarterback rating of 102.2.

On January 5, 2008, In the AFC Wild Card, Garrard led his team to a 31–29 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Down 29–28 with 1:56 to go, he led his team in a field goal-scoring drive highlighted by a 32-yard run on 4th and 2 that eventually set up the game-winning field goal for the Jaguars.

On January 12, 2008, In the AFC Divisional Round, Garrard set franchise records with 22 completions and 278 yards, along with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception against the unbeaten New England Patriots. However, the Patriots won the game, 31–20.

On April 7, 2008, it was announced that the Jaguars and Garrard had agreed to a contract extension, worth $60 million for 6 years.

Garrard played in all 16 games in both the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but the Jaguars only managed 5–11 and 7–9 records respectively. The team slumped behind multiple injuries to their offensive line, and new GM Gene Smith ushering in a &quot;rebuilding era.&quot;

Garrard was named to the 2009 Pro Bowl, and finished the game with 183 yards and a touchdown in the AFC&#x27;s win. He followed up his Pro Bowl appearance throwing for 23 touchdowns, 2,734 yards, a quarterback rating of 91 and an 8–6 record in 14 games in the 2010 season. In week 8, he completed 17 of 21 passes for 260 yards (a franchise record 12.4 average), four touchdowns, zero interceptions, a franchise record 157.8 rating, and rushed for a fifth score in a 35–17 win over the Cowboys.

Despite his Pro Bowl selection and a comeback year, Jacksonville drafted Missouri quarterback Blaine Gabbert with their first round draft pick. Though Del Rio insisted Garrard would remain the team&#x27;s starting quarterback, he was released by Jacksonville on September 6, 2011, less than a week before the start of the regular season.

After his release from Jacksonville, Garrard received interest from the Colts, Dolphins and Raiders. He instead decided to use his time off to have surgery on his herniated disk and prepare himself for the 2012 season.

=== Miami Dolphins ===
On March 19, 2012, Garrard agreed to terms with the Miami Dolphins on a one-year contract, and was assumed to be the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the year. On August 11, Garrard had arthroscopic knee surgery and was ruled out of all four preseason games. The Dolphins released Garrard on September 4, 2012.

=== New York Jets ===
The New York Jets announced that they had signed a contract with Garrard on March 11, 2013. Garrard announced his intention to retire on May 15, 2013, as consistent knee swelling impaired his ability to play. The Jets placed Garrard on the reserve/retired list on May 30, 2013.

After resting his knee, Garrard decided to make a comeback and the Jets agreed to allow Garrard to come back on October 10, 2013. He was placed on the exempt list for two weeks. He was activated on October 21, 2013.

=== Retirement ===
On May 8, 2015, Garrard signed a contract with the Jaguars to officially retire as a member of the team.

<text>In geometry, the disphenocingulum is a Johnson solid with 20 equilateral triangles and 4 squares as its faces.

== Properties ==
The disphenocingulum is named by . The prefix &quot;dispheno-&quot; refers to two wedgelike complexes, each formed by two adjacent lunes—a figure of two equilateral triangles at the opposite sides of a square. The suffix &quot;-cingulum&quot;, literally &#x27;belt&#x27;, refers to a band of 12 triangles joining the two wedges. The resulting polyhedron has 20 equilateral triangles and 4 squares, making 24 faces.. All of the faces are regular, categorizing the disphenocingulum as a Johnson solid—a convex polyhedron in which all of its faces are regular polygon—enumerated as 90th Johnson solid formula_1.. It is an elementary polyhedron, meaning that it cannot be separated by a plane into two small regular-faced polyhedra.

The surface area of a disphenocingulum with edge length formula_2 can be determined by adding all of its faces, the area of 20 equilateral triangles and 4 squares formula_3, and its volume is formula_4.

== Cartesian coordinates ==
Let formula_5 be the second smallest positive root of the polynomial
formula_6
and formula_7 and formula_8. Then, the Cartesian coordinates of a disphenocingulum with edge length 2 are given by the union of the orbits of the points

<text>Insaniquarium is a 2001 virtual pets simulator video game, developed by Flying Bear Entertainment and published by PopCap Games and MumboJumbo. Before PopCap Games&#x27;s involvement, the game was a web-based Java game released in 2001. The game was made downloadable by PopCap Games in 2004 and was ported to mobile devices in 2006 and 2008 by Glu Mobile and Astraware respectively. &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; has the player maintain a tank full of fish while protecting it from alien attacks.

&quot;Insaniquarium&quot; was mainly designed and programmed by George Fan through his company Flying Bear Entertainment. His main intention was to have the game featured in the Independent Games Festival. After learning the game had made it as a finalist, Fan paired up with PopCap Games to make the game downloadable. The game was a success, garnering general praise for its fast-paced gameplay, and was downloaded 20 million times as of April 2006.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Insaniquarium&quot; is a virtual pets simulator with a blend of elements from action, strategy, and puzzle video games. In the game, the player must manage a tank of guppies and other aquatic creatures, and each stage begins with two guppies in the tank. Guppies and other fish drop coins, which can be collected by the player and used to purchase fish food and upgrades, such as more aquatic creatures, food that can keep the fish full for a longer period of time, and laser upgrades to repel attackers. The coins will disappear if they reach the bottom of the tank. Each creature must be kept alive by feeding. The method of feeding depends on the type of fish to be fed. For example, guppies eat fish food bought by the player, and carnivores eat little guppies. In addition to feeding the fish, the player must protect them from aliens that periodically enter the tank and attempt to eat them. The aliens must be clicked on repeatedly with the mouse pointer in order to defeat them. If there are no fishes (or pets in Tank 5) in the tank by any means (except if Amp electrocutes the guppies, all guppies were turned into Nostradamus (both of which as long as there are no other fish types present in the tank), and all of the fish had died of hunger in Tank 1-1 for the first time), the player has to restart the level (Adventure) or mode (Time Trial and Challenge).

Insaniquarium can be played in four modes: Adventure, Time Trial, Challenge, or Virtual Tank. In Adventure mode, a player advances through four tanks, each with five levels. In each level, the player must earn enough money to buy three egg pieces to advance to the next level. During an initial playthrough of Adventure mode, at the end of each level of a tank, the player receives a new pet from the egg. While 24 pets can be earned throughout Adventure mode, each level requires the player to pick three pets. Each pet can aid the player during gameplay. There are bonus rounds where the player can collect shells, which can be spent to place fish in the Virtual Tank.

After a tank is completed in Adventure mode, it will be unlocked in Time Trial mode. Time Trial mode restricts the player to completing the first tank in five minutes and in ten minutes for the three subsequent tanks. The purpose of each level is to collect as much money before the time runs out. Challenge mode is unlocked after Adventure mode is completed, and there are four levels that are unlocked in subsequent order. The player has to fight increasingly difficult waves of aliens while taking care of the fishes and unlocking the pieces to the egg. Both modes award the player with shells. The Virtual Tank is the player&#x27;s personal aquarium where their fish is maintained. The tank can be used as a screensaver.

==Development==
During his time working for the online gaming portal Prizegames.com, George Fan was researching Java games. He came across the website for PopCap Games and found their games better than the other Java games he was researching. Afterwards, Fan left Prizegames.com and became a freelance video game designer. Fan started developing &quot;Insaniquarium&quot;, back then codenamed &quot;FishTank&quot;, using Java in July 2001. He paired up with his colleague, an artist named Tysen Henderson, for him to create the backgrounds. They formed Flying Bear Entertainment together to develop the game.

Fan&#x27;s main purpose with creating &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; was to develop a video game to enter into the Independent Games Festival, having decided to do so along with Henderson after seeing the independent games in Game Developers Conference 2001 (GDC 2001). Fan&#x27;s idea &quot;was to create a game that&#x27;s easy to get into, yet unfolds into something much deeper.&quot; The first prototype simply featured clicking on the fish to feed them when necessary. Fan decided to add more depth to &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; due to his inspiration from an unknown Java game, which let the player buy upgrades with accumulated resources. He entered &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; into the festival in 2002. The prototype submitted took a month to create.

Fan was in a cyber cafe in Hawaii when he heard that &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; made it into the festival as a finalist, to which he openly screamed with joy. &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; later won the festival&#x27;s category &quot;Innovation in Game Design&quot;. Fan contacted PopCap Games and asked if they would be at GDC 2002. They met up at Fan&#x27;s finalist booth at the conference. PopCap offered Fan aid in publishing &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; as a downloadable game, though didn&#x27;t hire him as Fan was already offered a job at Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard allowed Fan to develop &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; before working with them, and PopCap Games aided Fan on &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; for the next two years. Following the start of PopCap Games&#x27;s aid, &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; used PopCap Games Framework as its engine. Fan designed and programmed a majority of the game along with drawing its concept art and composing some of the music.

==Release==
Flying Bear Entertainment first released &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; as a free, Java-based online game on their website on August 31, 2001. The game received updates over the next year. Following GDC 2002, PopCap Games became the publisher for &quot;Insaniquarium&quot;. The second version was released on PopCap Games&#x27;s official website on July 29, 2002. The paid downloadable version, known as &quot;Insaniquarium Deluxe&quot;, was released in 2004.

Earlier in 2004 around April, &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; was released to personal digital assistants (PDAs). Glu Mobile announced in December 2005 that &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; was being ported to mobile phones. They released &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; for the mobile platform on April 13, 2006, in the United States, and on June 29, 2006, in Europe. Astraware later released the game on Palm OS smartphones and Windows Mobile phones on August 6, 2008.

==Reception==

&quot;Insaniquarium&quot; was a success. &quot;IGN&quot; reported in December 2005 that &quot;Insaniquarium Deluxe&quot; reached over 18 million downloads on the PC. In April 2006, &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; reported 20 million downloads.

&quot;Insaniquarium&quot; also received positive appraisal. Jay Bibby of &quot;Jay is Games&quot; called &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; &quot;cute, strange and addictive&quot;. &quot;PCMag&quot; Carol Mangnis stated that &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; &quot;takes the joy and anxiety of maintaining an aquarium and turns [it] into a supercharged Tamagotchi-like experience.&quot; Retrospectively, Jordan Devore from &quot;Destructoid&quot; felt that &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; had aged well. Jody Macgregor of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; listed &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; on his list of best underwater games. He said &quot;&quot;Insaniquarium&quot; takes the inane pleasantness of owning a fish tank and video gamifies the hell out of it.&quot;

The fast-paced gameplay was praised by many critics. Steve Palley of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; is &quot;a fast-clicking experience that&#x27;s several orders of magnitude crazier than your typical real-life aquarium.&quot; &quot;GameDaily&quot; Samantha Rupert recommended &quot;Insaniquarium&quot;, having written that the game never gets boring due to how it changes every five levels. Stuart Dredge from &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; noted how &quot;Insaniquarium&quot; constantly introduced new resources to keep the game interesting, though, in contrast to Rupert, Dredge said that players would tire of the game faster than they would hope. Dieter Bohn of &quot;Windows Central&quot; recommended playing the game for &quot;something to pass the time with or just need[ing] a little pick-me-up after a long day at work.&quot;

The game&#x27;s visuals were also praised by some critics. &quot;IGN&quot; Levi Buchanan said that every tank was &quot;almost fiercely colorful&quot;, and that the guppies and the ultravores evoke different emotions. Joel Brodie of &quot;Gamezebo&quot; praised the graphics and the amount of personality that each character had. Bohn found the graphics to be &quot;nice&quot; and the user interface simple.

<doc id="1170263" wikidata="Q282411" url="?curid=1170263" title="Hunt-class destroyer">
<text>The Hunt class was a class of escort destroyer of the Royal Navy. The first vessels were ordered early in 1939, and the class saw extensive service in the Second World War, particularly on the British east coast and Mediterranean convoys. They were named after British fox hunts. The modern Hunt-class GRP hulled mine countermeasure vessels maintain the Hunt names lineage in the Royal Navy.

==History==
The Royal Navy had identified the need for two types of destroyer: larger vessels with heavy gun and torpedo armaments for fleet work and another type for escort duties. Although old fleet destroyers could be allocated to escort work, they were unsuitable for the task and new construction replaced them. Fleet destroyers were designed for speed and their machinery was inefficient at convoy speeds, reducing their range. Their shape made them poor sea boats at low speed, also exacerbated by additional equipment on the superstructure. Modifications were needed to ease these problems.

The escort vessels forsook the heavy armament and some of the speed of the fleet type to reduce unit cost and better suit mass production and the conditions. This new &quot;fast escort vessel&quot; was later classified as an &quot;escort destroyer&quot;.

Eighty-six Hunts were completed, of which 72 were commissioned into the Royal Navy and the remaining 14 were transferred to allied navies; &quot;Bolebrooke&quot;, &quot;Border&quot;, &quot;Catterick&quot;, &quot;Hatherleigh&quot;, &quot;Modbury&quot;, &quot;Bramham&quot; and &quot;Hursley&quot; to the Greek Royal Hellenic Navy, &quot;Bedale&quot;, &quot;Oakley&quot; (i) and &quot;Silverton&quot; to the Free Polish Navy, &quot;Glaisdale&quot;, &quot;Eskdale&quot; and &quot;Badsworth&quot; to the Royal Norwegian Navy and &quot;Haldon&quot; to the Free French Navy.

==Design==
The Hunts were modelled on the 1938 escort sloop , a ship of 1,190 tons with on geared turbines for and an armament of three twin Mark XIX mounts for the QF  gun Mark XVI. The guns were controlled by a Fuze Keeping Clock AA fire control computer when engaging aircraft. The Hunt class was to ship the same armament, plus a quadruple QF 2-pounder mount Mark VII on a hull of the same length but with less beam and installed power raised to to give . The first twenty were ordered in March and April 1939. They were constructed to Admiralty standards, as were contemporary destroyers, unlike the frigates, which conformed much more to mercantile practice.

Clearly, the Hunts posed a major design challenge. They would be too short and narrow and of insufficient range for open ocean work, being restricted to the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea. This sacrifice was accepted to give any chance of meeting the requirements. The demanding specifications in an overworked Admiralty design department resulted in a major design miscalculation. When the detailed calculations were done the centre of gravity was higher than expected and the beam was increased. As the first ships were being completed it was found that the design was as much as 70 tons overweight, top-heavy, leaving them dangerously deficient in stability. The first twenty ships were so far advanced in construction that it was necessary to remove the &#x27;X&#x27; 4-inch gun mount and add 50 tons of permanent ballast. These ships became the Type I group and had the multiple 2-pounder guns relocated from behind the funnel to the more advantageous &#x27;X&#x27; position.

The design deficiency of the Type I was rectified by splitting the hulls lengthwise and adding a 2½ foot section, increasing the beam to 31 ft 6 in and the margin of stability sufficiently for the designed armament to be shipped. These ships became the Type II group, and also had a revised design of bridge with the compass platform extending forwards to the wheelhouse face. Under the 1939 Emergency War Programme, 36 more Hunts had been ordered; three of these were completed to the original (Type I) design. Depth charge stowage could also be increased from 40 in the Type I to 110.

For the 1940 building programme, torpedoes were deemed necessary. The next 27 ships were completed to a revised design, the Type III group, and were intended for Mediterranean work. They sacrificed &#x27;Y&#x27; gun for a pair of 21-inch torpedo tubes amidships, the searchlight being displaced to the aft shelter deck as a result. The Type III Hunts could be easily identified as they had a straight funnel with a sloping top and the foremast had no rake. Fourteen of them had their stabiliser fins removed (or not fitted in the first place) and the space used for extra fuel oil.
The last two Hunts came from an independent lineage and were built to a private design that had been prepared pre-war by John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company. Submitted to the Admiralty and rejected in 1938, a modified design had been accepted in 1940. They were known as the Type IV. They had a novel hull design, with a U-shaped forward section with a distinctive double knuckle and a full centre section with a square turn at the bilge. This form was intended to increase low-speed efficiency and reduce rolling without the need for ballast or stabilisers to improve the ships as gun platforms; testing showed an 8% increase in steaming efficiency at for a 2% loss full ahead. Other features included a long fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle stretching for most of the length of the ship, which increased internal accommodation space (the lack of which was a perennial problem in wartime ships with enlarged crews) and allowed the crew to fight the ship almost completely under cover. &#x27;X&#x27; gun was now at the fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle deck level rather than on a raised shelter deck. The design was large enough to carry a triple set of torpedoes but as they too were at fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle deck level the training apparatus had to be remotely mounted a deck below.

Armament was completed by a pair of 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings and a pair of power operated twin 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns amidships. This was quickly discovered to be ineffective and was replaced by the Mark V twin mounting for the Oerlikon guns. The level of protection afforded to the crews in these two ships was found to be beneficial in wartime, where crews were often closed up at action stations for extended periods of time in appalling weather conditions, and the design – although it was something of a dead end – influenced post-war escort designs. All Hunt class except three Type II and the Type IV &quot;Brissenden&quot; had fin stabilisers forward to reduce rolling to make for a steadier gun platform. These were subsequently removed from the majority of the Type III ships to allow for an increase in bunkerage of 63 tons.

==Modifications==
The Hunt class was a very satisfactory design, but had limited surplus displacement to allow any major modifications. All ships had a pair of single Oerlikon guns added in the bridge wings as they became available, and Type 285 radar added to the Rangefinder-Director Mark I carried on the bridge for the main armament. The air warning Type 286 radar was added at the masthead, later replaced by Type 291, and &quot;Cotswold&quot;, &quot;Silverton&quot;, &quot;Bleasdale&quot; and &quot;Wensleydale&quot; had their searchlight replaced by Type 272 radar, a centimetric target indication set.

Those vessels employed on East Coast convoy work, all the Type Is, the Type IIs &quot;Avon Vale&quot;, &quot;Blencathra&quot; and &quot;Liddesdale&quot; and the Type IIIs &quot;Bleasdale&quot; and &quot;Glaisdale&quot; were fitted with a single QF 2-pounder &quot;bow chaser&quot; gun for anti-E-boat work. Most Type IIIs later had their single Oerlikon guns replaced with twin powered mountings Mark V, and some had two single 40 mm Bofors guns added, one each forward of the wheelhouse and on the quarterdeck.

==Type I==

The first ten of the following were ordered on 21 March 1939, and the other ten on 11 April 1939. Three more were ordered on 4 September 1939 (see below) were intended to be of Type II, but were actually completed to the Type I design.

<text>Samir Georges Nassib Hammam (; born 17 July 1947) is a Lebanese businessman, well known for his high-profile involvement in British football clubs, and who most recently relinquished the life presidency of Cardiff City in March 2022 following a legal dispute.

==Wimbledon==
Originally moving to the area due to being a keen tennis fan, Hammam became involved in football by buying £40,000 worth of shares at non-league Wimbledon F.C. in two years, eventually taking full control of the club in 1977.

Under Hammam, Wimbledon achieved four promotions in nine years, becoming a Football League First Division club in 1986 and winning the FA Cup in 1988.

In 1990, before Wimbledon had moved out of their Plough Lane ground to groundshare at Selhurst Park with local rivals Crystal Palace, Hammam bought out a covenant held on the ground by the Council that required it to be retained for sporting use. During the 1990s, Hammam failed in an attempt to relocate the club to Dublin, Ireland.

In 1997, Hammam sold 80% of his shares in Wimbledon to Bjørn Rune Gjelsten and Kjell Inge Røkke. He sold the remaining 20% to Gjelsten and Røkke in February 2000, three months before the club&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League. In 2004, Wimbledon F.C. was relocated to Milton Keynes and rebranded as the MK Dons, with the newly formed AFC Wimbledon often considered the successor club to the original Wimbledon.

==Cardiff City==
Hammam purchased control of Cardiff City F.C. at the end of 2000, where he picked up where he left off with Wimbledon. After taking over at Cardiff, Hammam controversially pledged to get the entire Welsh nation to support Cardiff by renaming the club &quot;The Cardiff Celts&quot; and changing the club colours to green, red and white.

At Cardiff he became a cult-hero with fans for taking part in their head-patting &#x27;do the Ayatollah&#x27; chant. One such game saw him performing the celebration during an infamous 2–1 home win in the FA Cup against then-Premier League side Leeds United in 2002. This, along with other aspects of his behaviour during the match, were blamed for contributing to the subsequent violence between Leeds and Cardiff fans at the end of the match.

After failing to get the new stadium plans agreed by Cardiff Council due to concerns over financial security in 2006, Hammam agreed to a takeover by a consortium led by new chairman Peter Ridsdale and including local businessman Paul Guy. In March 2008, Cardiff City began a court case against financial backers Langston over the repayment of a loan believed to be worth around £31 million. During the hearing the barrister representing the club named Sam Hammam as the man they believe to be behind the company. No settlement was reached in the case.

In July 2013, following Cardiff City&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League, it emerged that Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan, who had taken effective control of the club in 2010, was in advanced talks with Hammam – confirmed as Langston&#x27;s spokesman – about repayment of the loan, then thought to be around £24 million. Four days later, on 18 July 2013, Tan announced that an &quot;amicable resolution&quot; had been reached between Cardiff City and Langston over the debt issue, with Sam Hammam becoming a life president of the club. Hammam confirmed this in an interview with the BBC on 24 July, requesting that fans of the club back the Malaysian owner. However, in March 2022, an out of court settlement was reached between Hammam and club owner Vincent Tan which saw this life presidency role relinquished and all ties severed with the football club; following a legal dispute reportedly concerning the terms and the conditions of the role.

==Controversy==
Hammam has achieved a level of notoriety in British football for his unusual antics at matches, frequently walking around the pitchside during games, and his eccentric methods of publicising himself and his players. On at least one occasion he made a player eat sheep&#x27;s testicles prior to signing with Cardiff City.

In geometry, the bilunabirotunda is a Johnson solid with faces of 8 equilateral triangles, 2 squares, and 4 regular pentagons.

== Properties ==
The bilunabirotunda is named from the prefix &quot;lune&quot;, meaning a figure featuring two triangles adjacent to opposite sides of a square. Therefore, the faces of a bilunabirotunda possess 8 equilateral triangles, 2 squares, and 4 regular pentagons as it faces. It is one of the Johnson solids—a convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygon—enumerated as 91st Johnson solid formula_1. It is known as the elementary polyhedron, meaning that it cannot be separated by a plane into two small regular-faced polyhedra.

The surface area of a bilunabirotunda with edge length formula_2 is:
formula_3
and the volume of a bilunabirotunda is:
formula_4

== Cartesian coordinates ==
One way to construct a bilunabirotunda with edge length formula_5 is by union of the orbits of the coordinates
formula_6
under the group&#x27;s action (of order 8) generated by reflections about coordinate planes.

== Applications ==
 discusses the bilunabirotunda as a shape that could be used in architecture.

== Related polyhedra and honeycombs==
Six bilunabirotundae can be augmented around a cube with pyritohedral symmetry. B. M. Stewart labeled this six-bilunabirotunda model as 6J91(P4).
Such clusters combine with regular dodecahedra to form a space-filling honeycomb.

<doc id="1170291" wikidata="Q104575" url="?curid=1170291" title="Paul Sabatier (chemist)">
<text>Paul Sabatier (; 5 November 1854 – 14 August 1941) was a French chemist, born in Carcassonne. In 1912, Sabatier was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Victor Grignard. Sabatier was honoured for his work improving the hydrogenation of organic species in the presence of metals.

==Education==

Sabatier studied at the École Normale Supérieure, starting in 1874. Three years later, he graduated at the top of his class. In 1880, he was awarded a Doctor of Science degree from the College de France.

In 1883 Sabatier succeeded Édouard Filhol at the Faculty of Science, and began a long collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Senderens, so close that it was impossible to distinguish the work of either man.
They jointly published 34 notes in the &quot;Accounts of the Academy of Science&quot;, 11 memoirs in the &quot;Bulletin of the French Chemical Society&quot; and 2 joint memoirs to the &quot;Annals of Chemistry and Physics&quot;.

After the discovery of nickel tetracarbonyl in 1890 they tried to synthesize similar compound with nitrogen oxides, but only discovered different types of oxidation. As late as 1912, Sabatier believed that it&#x27;s possible to get &quot;true nitro metals&quot; with dinitrogen tetroxide, but it was later proven that these were not real chemical compounds but just metal oxides with nitrogen dioxide physically absorbed on them.

In 1896 Henri Moissan and Charles Moureu discovered that acetylene reacts with some transition metals. Bearing in mind Prosper de Wilde (1835-1916) hydrogenated acetylene on platinum black in 1874, Sabatier and Senderens picked up the topic and continued investigations in the area.

The methanation reactions of COx were first discovered by Sabatier and Senderens in 1902.
Sabatier and Senderen shared the Academy of Science&#x27;s Jecker Prize in 1905 for their discovery of the Sabatier–Senderens Process.

After 1905–06 Senderens and Sabatier published few joint works, perhaps due to the classic problem of recognition of the merit of contributions to joint work.
Sabatier taught science classes most of his life before he became Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Toulouse in 1905.

==Research==
Sabatier&#x27;s earliest research concerned the thermochemistry of sulfur and metallic sulfates, the subject for the thesis leading to his doctorate. In Toulouse, he continued his physical and chemical investigations to sulfides, chlorides, chromates and copper compounds. He also studied the oxides of nitrogen and nitrosodisulfonic acid and its salts and carried out fundamental research on partition coefficients and absorption spectra. Sabatier greatly facilitated the industrial use of hydrogenation. In 1897, building on the recent biochemical work of the American chemist, James Boyce, he discovered that the introduction of a trace amount of nickel (as a catalyst) facilitated the addition of hydrogen to molecules of most carbon compounds.

=== Sabatier reaction ===
Sabatier is best known for the Sabatier process and his works such as &quot;La Catalyse en Chimie Organique&quot; (Catalysis in organic chemistry) which was published in 1913. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly with fellow Frenchman Victor Grignard in 1912. 

The reduction of carbon dioxide using hydrogen at high temperature and pressure is another use of nickel catalyst to produce methane.
:formula_1
:∆&quot;H&quot; = −165.0 kJ/mol
:(some initial energy/heat is required to start the reaction)

=== Sabatier principle ===
He is also known for the Sabatier principle of catalysis.

==Personal life==

Sabatier was married and had four daughters, one of whom wed the Italian chemist Emilio Pomilio.

The Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France is named in honour of Paul Sabatier, as is one of Carcassonne&#x27;s high schools. Paul Sabatier was a co-founder of the Annales de la Faculté des Sciences de Toulouse, together with the mathematician Thomas Joannes Stieltjes.

Sabatier died on 14 August, 1941 in Toulouse at the age of 86.

<doc id="1170314" wikidata="Q14613383" url="?curid=1170314" title="Wingtip vortices">
<text>Wingtip vortices are circular patterns of rotating air left behind a wing as it generates lift. The name is a misnomer because the cores of the vortices are slightly inboard of the wing tips. Wingtip vortices are sometimes named &quot;trailing&quot; or &quot;lift-induced vortices&quot; because they also occur at points other than at the wing tips. Indeed, vorticity is trailed at any point on the wing where the lift varies span-wise (a fact described and quantified by the lifting-line theory); it eventually rolls up into large vortices near the wingtip, at the edge of flap devices, or at other abrupt changes in wing planform.

Wingtip vortices are associated with induced drag, the imparting of downwash, and are a fundamental consequence of three-dimensional lift generation. Careful selection of wing geometry (in particular, wingspan), as well as of cruise conditions, are design and operational methods to minimize induced drag.

Wingtip vortices form the primary component of wake turbulence. Depending on ambient atmospheric humidity as well as the geometry and wing loading of aircraft, water may condense or freeze in the core of the vortices, making the vortices visible.

== Generation of trailing vortices ==

When a wing generates aerodynamic lift, it results in a region of downwash between the two vortices.

Three-dimensional lift and the occurrence of wingtip vortices can be approached with the concept of horseshoe vortex and described accurately with the Lanchester–Prandtl theory. In this view, the trailing vortex is a continuation of the &quot;wing-bound vortex&quot; inherent to the lift generation.

== Effects and mitigation ==

Wingtip vortices are associated with induced drag, an unavoidable consequence of three-dimensional lift generation. The rotary motion of the air within the shed wingtip vortices (sometimes described as a &quot;leakage&quot;) reduces the effective angle of attack of the air on the wing.

The lifting-line theory describes the shedding of trailing vortices as span-wise changes in lift distribution. For a given wing span and surface, minimal induced drag is obtained with an elliptical lift distribution. For a given lift distribution and wing planform area, induced drag is reduced with increasing aspect ratio.

As a consequence, aircraft for which a high lift-to-drag ratio is desirable, such as gliders or long-range airliners, typically have high aspect ratio wings. Such wings however have disadvantages with respect to structural constraints and maneuverability, as evidenced by combat and aerobatic planes which usually feature short, stubby wings despite the efficiency losses.

Another method of reducing induced drag is the use of winglets, as seen on most modern airliners. Winglets increase the effective aspect ratio of the wing, changing the pattern and magnitude of the vorticity in the vortex pattern. A reduction is achieved in the kinetic energy in the circular air flow, which reduces the amount of fuel expended to perform work upon the spinning air[&quot;&quot;].

After NASA became concerned about the increasing density of air traffic potentially causing vortex related accidents at airports, an experiment by NASA Ames Research Center wind tunnel testing with a 747 model found that the configuration of the flaps could be changed on existing aircraft to break the vortex into three smaller and less disturbing vortexes. This primarily involved changing the settings of the outboard flaps, and could theoretically be retrofitted to existing aircraft.

== Visibility of vortices ==

The cores of the vortices can sometimes be visible when the water present in them condenses from gas (vapor) to liquid. This water can sometimes even freeze, forming ice particles.

Condensation of water vapor in wing tip vortices is most common on aircraft flying at high angles of attack, such as fighter aircraft in high &quot;g&quot; maneuvers, or airliners taking off and landing on humid days.

=== Aerodynamic condensation and freezing ===
The cores of vortices spin at very high speed and are regions of very low pressure. To first approximation, these low-pressure regions form with little exchange of heat with the neighboring regions (i.e., adiabatically), so the local temperature in the low-pressure regions drops, too. If it drops below the local dew point, there results a condensation of water vapor present in the cores of wingtip vortices, making them visible. The temperature may even drop below the local freezing point, in which case ice crystals will form inside the cores.

The phase of water (i.e., whether it assumes the form of a solid, liquid, or gas) is determined by its temperature and pressure. For example, in the case of liquid-gas transition, at each pressure there is a special &quot;transition temperature&quot; formula_1 such that if the sample temperature is even a little above formula_1, the sample will be a gas, but, if the sample temperature is even a little below formula_1, the sample will be a liquid; see phase transition. For example, at the standard atmospheric pressure, formula_1 is 100 °C = 212 °F. The transition temperature formula_1 decreases with decreasing pressure (which explains why water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes and at higher temperatures in a pressure cooker; see here for more information). In the case of water vapor in air, the formula_1 corresponding to the partial pressure of water vapor is called the dew point. (The solid–liquid transition also happens around a specific transition temperature called the melting point. For most substances, the melting point also decreases with decreasing pressure, although water ice in particular - in its Ih form, which is the most familiar one - is a prominent exception to this rule.)

Vortex cores are regions of low pressure. As a vortex core begins to form, the water in the air (in the region that is about to become the core) is in vapor phase, which means that the local temperature is above the local dew point. After the vortex core forms, the pressure inside it has decreased from the ambient value, and so the local dew point (formula_1) has dropped from the ambient value. Thus, &quot;in and of itself&quot;, a drop in pressure would tend to keep water in vapor form: The initial dew point was already below the ambient air temperature, and the formation of the vortex has made the local dew point even lower. However, as the vortex core forms, its pressure (and so its dew point) is not the only property that is dropping: The vortex-core temperature is dropping also, and in fact it can drop by much more than the dew point does.

To first approximation, the formation of vortex cores is thermodynamically an adiabatic process, i.e., one with no exchange of heat. In such a process, the drop in pressure is accompanied by a drop in temperature, according to the following equation of state:

:formula_8

Here formula_9 and formula_10 are the absolute temperature and pressure at the beginning of the process (here equal to the ambient air temperature and pressure), formula_11 and formula_12 are the absolute temperature and pressure in the vortex core (which is the end result of the process), and the constant formula_13 is about 7/5 = 1.4 for air (see here).

Thus, even though the local dew point inside the vortex cores is even lower than in the ambient air, the water vapor may nevertheless condense — if the formation of the vortex brings the local temperature below the new local dew point.

For a typical transport aircraft landing at an airport, these conditions are as follows: formula_9 and formula_10 have values corresponding to the so-called standard conditions, i.e., formula_10 = 1 atm = 1013.25 mb = 101formula_17325 Pa and formula_9 = 293.15 K (which is 20 °C = 68 °F). The relative humidity is a comfortable 35% (dew point of 4.1 °C = 39.4 °F). This corresponds to a partial pressure of water vapor of 820 Pa = 8.2 mb. In a vortex core, the pressure (formula_12) drops to about 80% of the ambient pressure, i.e., to about 80 000 Pa.

The temperature in the vortex core is given by the equation above as formula_20 or 0.86 °C = 33.5 °F.

Next, the partial pressure of water in the vortex core drops in proportion to the drop in the total pressure (i.e., by the same percentage), to about 650 Pa = 6.5 mb. According to a dew point calculator, that partial pressure results in the local dew point of about 0.86 °C; in other words, the new local dew point is about equal to the new local temperature.

Therefore, this is a marginal case; if the relative humidity of the ambient air were even a bit higher (with the total pressure and temperature remaining as above), then the local dew point inside the vortices would rise, while the local temperature would remain the same. Thus, the local temperature would now be &quot;lower&quot; than the local dew point, and so the water vapor inside the vortices would indeed condense. Under the right conditions, the local temperature in vortex cores may drop below the local freezing point, in which case ice particles will form inside the vortex cores.

The water-vapor condensation mechanism in wingtip vortices is thus driven by local changes in air pressure and temperature. This is to be contrasted to what happens in another well-known case of water condensation related to airplanes: the contrails from airplane engine exhausts. In the case of contrails, the local air pressure and temperature do not change significantly; what matters instead is that the exhaust contains both water vapor (which increases the local water-vapor concentration and so its partial pressure, resulting in elevated dew point and freezing point) as well as aerosols (which provide nucleation centers for the condensation and freezing).

== Formation flight ==
One theory on migrating bird flight states that many larger bird species fly in a V formation so that all but the leader bird can take advantage of the upwash part of the wingtip vortex of the bird ahead.

== Hazards ==
Wingtip vortices can pose a hazard to aircraft, especially during the landing and takeoff phases of flight. The intensity or strength of the vortex is a function of aircraft size, speed, and configuration (flap setting, etc.). The strongest vortices are produced by heavy aircraft, flying slowly, with wing flaps and landing gear retracted (&quot;heavy, slow and clean&quot;). Large jet aircraft can generate vortices that can persist for many minutes, drifting with the wind.

The hazardous aspects of wingtip vortices are most often discussed in the context of wake turbulence. If a light aircraft immediately follows a heavy aircraft, wake turbulence from the heavy aircraft can roll the light aircraft faster than can be resisted by use of ailerons. At low altitudes, in particular during takeoff and landing, this can lead to an upset from which recovery is not possible. (&quot;Light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; are relative terms, and even smaller jets have been rolled by this effect.) Air traffic controllers attempt to ensure an adequate separation between departing and arriving aircraft by issuing wake turbulence warnings to pilots.

In general, to avoid vortices an aircraft is safer if its takeoff is before the rotation point of the airplane that took off before it. However care must be taken to stay upwind (or otherwise away) from any vortices that were generated by the previous aircraft. On landing behind an airplane the aircraft should stay above the earlier one&#x27;s flight path and touch down further along the runway.

Glider pilots routinely practice flying in wingtip vortices when they do a maneuver called &quot;boxing the wake&quot;. This involves descending from the higher to lower position behind a tow plane. This is followed by making a rectangular figure by holding the glider at high and low points away from the towing plane before coming back up through the vortices. (For safety this is not done below 1500 feet above the ground, and usually with an instructor present.) Given the relatively slow speeds and lightness of both aircraft the procedure is safe but does instill a sense of how strong and where the turbulence is located.

<doc id="1170317" wikidata="Q1061176" url="?curid=1170317" title="Happy Science">
<text>, formerly known as the Institute for Research in Human Happiness, is a new religious movement founded in Japan on 6 October 1986 by former Wall Street trader Ryuho Okawa, whose followers regarded him as the incarnation of a supreme being from Venus. Happy Science has been described as a cult.

The Happy Science group includes a publication division called IRH Press, schools such as Happy Science Academy and Happy Science University, a political party called the Happiness Realization Party, and three media entertainment divisions, which are called New Star Production, ARI Production and HS Pictures Studio.

==History==
On 15 July 1986, Ryuho Okawa resigned from his position at (now Toyota Tsusho) to found his own organization on October 6, which he dubbed Happy Science; the Japanese government did not certify it as a religious organization until 7 March 1991. According to Ryuho Okawa, its aim is &quot;to bring happiness to humanity by spreading truth&quot;. Before its foundation, Ryuho Okawa had published various books of &quot;spiritual messages&quot; that claim to channel the words spoken by religious and historical figures such as Jesus Christ, Confucius and Nichiren. In 1987, he printed &quot;The Laws of the Sun&quot;, &quot;The Golden Laws&quot;, and &quot;The Laws of Eternity&quot;, forming the core textbooks of Happy Science, along with its fundamental sutra &quot;The Dharma of the Right Mind&quot;.

==Teachings==
The basic teachings of Happy Science are &quot;Exploration of the Right Mind&quot;, &quot;The Fourfold Path&quot;, and El Cantare belief. According to Okawa, in order to obtain happiness one must practice the Principles of Happiness known as &quot;The Fourfold Path&quot;: love that gives, wisdom, self-reflection, and progress. The only requirement to join Happy Science is that applicants must have &quot;the aspiration and discipline to seek the truth and actively contribute to the realization of love, peace and happiness on Earth&quot;. Among other teachings, they believe in the existence of reincarnation, angels, demons, heaven and hell, and aliens. Members of Happy Science attend training courses () and in order to increase their level within the group&#x27;s hierarchy.

At the same time, the organization&#x27;s political wing, the Happiness Realization Party, promotes political views that include support for Japanese military expansion, support for the use of nuclear deterrence, and denial of historical events such as the Nanjing Massacre in China and the comfort women issue in South Korea. Some other views include infrastructure spending, natural disaster prevention, urban development, and dam construction. They also advocate fiscal conservatism, strengthening the US-Japan alliance, and a virtue-based leadership. , the Happiness Realization Party had 21 local councilors.

===Object of worship===
Happy Science worships a deity named El Cantare who they believe is the &quot;Highest God of Earth, the Lord of all gods&quot;. They believe that the being was first born on Earth 330million years ago and that it is the same entity that has been worshipped at different times as Elohim, Odin, Thoth, Ophealis (Osiris), Hermes and Shakyamuni Buddha, with Okawa himself as the current incarnation.

==Facilities==

General headquarters, worship facilities, and missionary sites are located in Japan and other countries. Worship facilities are called ( or in Sanskrit) or (). In 1994, the first overseas branch, &quot;Happiness Science USA&quot; was established in New York. The organisation has branches in several countries including South Korea, Brazil, Uganda, the UK, Australia, India and Singapore. In addition to places of worship, Happy Science also operates two boarding schools in Nasu and Ōtsu, Japan.

==Controversy==
Happy Science is widely regarded as a cult and one of many controversial Japanese new religions (). Through the 1990s the group had a bitter rivalry with doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, culminating in a failed assassination attempt on Okawa using the nerve agent VX injected into the air conditioning system of leader Ryuho Okawa&#x27;s car. It was one of many VX attacks by Aum members leading up to the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, which killed 14 and injured more than 5,000 people.

Happy Science has also released promotional videos claiming, without evidence, that North Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China are plotting the nuclear destruction of Japan. The group has sold &quot;spiritual vaccines&quot;, falsely claiming that they prevent and cure COVID-19, advertised virus-related blessings at rates from $100 USD to over $400 USD, and sold coronavirus-themed DVDs and CDs of Okawa lecturing, which make false claims of supposedly boosting immunity, . After initially defying physical distancing measures, it later closed its New York temple, announcing that it had administered their fraudulent &quot;vaccines&quot; remotely.

In February 2017, actress Fumika Shimizu abruptly retired from her former entertainment production agency amidst multiple filming projects for a full-time role in Happy Science, declaring she had been a member of the group since childhood, under the influence of her parents, both of whom were longtime believers in Happy Science.

Okawa&#x27;s son and potential successor, Hiroshi Okawa, left the movement and is now one of its outspoken critics. In an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he commented, &quot;I believe what my father does is complete nonsense&quot;. His father has denounced Hiroshi as &quot;demonic&quot; and possessed by devils and the group has sued him for defamation. In a 2022 interview with The World, Hiroshi described Happy Science as a &quot;cult&quot;. Regarding Ryuho Okawa&#x27;s spiritual channeling sessions, Hiroshi said &quot;It&#x27;s just a performance&quot;. Hiroshi also estimated the number of Happy Science members to be around 13,000.

==In popular culture==
On February 10, 2022, the fifth chapter of anthology manga (&#x27;A Home Life With God ~We Children Born Into Religion~&#x27;), written by Mariko Kikuchi as a criticism of Happy Science and other fringe religious organizations, was removed by the publisher, Shueisha following backlash from Happy Science. The other chapters were removed on March 17, 2022. It was later reported by the Weekly Flash magazine in April.

Happy Science has produced several theatrical animated movies, often made by mainstream anime studios, live action films and documentaries promoting their beliefs. These include:

<doc id="1170320" wikidata="Q1398923" url="?curid=1170320" title="Munir Bashir">
<text>Munir Bashir (; ; 1930 – September 28, 1997) was an Iraqi-Assyrian oudist. Bashir is considered one of the foremost virtuosos of the Arabic oud, and is widely renowned as one of the most important figures in 20th century Middle Eastern music.

Bashir is widely regarded both for his extensive mastery of the Arabic modal system of maqam and his virtuosity in the improvisational tradition of Arabic taqsim. He is credited as being the first major figure to elevate the Arabic oud to the realm of solo concert performance, and was among the first Middle Eastern instrumentalists to gain recognition in the United States and Europe. His music is characterized by a unique style of improvisation that sometimes saw his native traditional Arabic music fused with Indian and European musical influences. Bashir also pioneered many techniques on the oud which have since become standard practice.

Bashir is the father of oudist Omar Bashir, who later received acclaim as a master oudist in his own right, and with whom he recorded several albums. He is also the brother of oudist Jamil Bashir. Although Bashir was born in Iraq, the tumultuous political landscape of violent coups and wars during his lifetime eventually led to his seeking refuge in Europe. He first gained prominence in Hungary, where he would maintain a permanent residence throughout most of his adult years. 

==Life==

===Early life===
Munir Bashir was born in Mosul, in northern Iraq, to an Assyrian Christian family. His exact birth year is debated, with sources suggesting a range from 1928 to 1930.

His father, Abd al-Aziz, and his brother, Jamil, were well-regarded oud soloists and vocalists; Jamil also authored an important textbook on the oud. The family began educating young Bashir in music at the age of five, with his father teaching him and Jamil the basics of the oud. Abd al-Aziz, who was also a poet, believed that the pure and historic tradition of Arab music had declined in Baghdad, which he wanted to preserve.

Bashir initially learned to play the violoncello, a European instrument that had become popular as a bass instrument in Arabic music towards the end of the 19th century. Simultaneously, he was taught to play the oud. In Arabic music, the oud holds a similar role to the piano in European music, being the instrument used to impart essential theoretical aspects of music.

Northern Iraq has a rich musical history due to the blend of various styles and traditions. In this milieu, Bashir encountered Byzantine, Kurdish, Assyrian, Turkish, Persian, and traditional Abbasid music.

===Moving to Baghdad===

At the age of six, the prodigiously talented Bashir was sent to the Baghdad Conservatory, which was founded in 1934 by the distinguished Turkish musicologist Şerif Muhyi ad-Din Haydar Targan (1892–1967).

Bashir was intensely focused during his studies, and especially after earning his degree, on documenting and preserving the traditional musical styles of his country. These styles had been increasingly overshadowed by &quot;Western&quot; influences, particularly commercial ones, due to Iraq&#x27;s turbulent history and other factors.

In 1951, Bashir accepted a teaching position at the newly founded Académie des Beaux-Arts in Baghdad. In addition to his teaching duties, he worked as an editor for Iraqi broadcasting.

===Exploring outside of Iraq===
Iraq experienced intense political instability during most of Bashir&#x27;s lifetime, leading Bashir to have an ambivalent relationship with his homeland. The 1950s and 1960s, in particular, marked the final years of the Hashemite monarchy, leading to the fall of Faisal II and a series of military coups shortly thereafter. Thus, although Bashir felt deeply rooted in the rich cultural heritage of Mesopotamia, this event ultimately forced him to leave Iraq and work abroad in 1958.

Bashir traveled first to Beirut. His reputation had preceded him by the time he&#x27;d arrived; he was promptly hired as an accompanist and &quot;star soloist&quot; for the legendary Lebanese singer Fairuz in 1953. During this time, he became acquainted with American and Latin American popular music, and started to become interested in fusing these styles with traditional Arabic music. He became intensely interested in musicology, which would eventually earn him teaching positions at conservatories in both Beirut and Baghdad.

The years 1953 and 1954 were pivotal in Bashir’s development as a virtuoso instrumentalist. His first concert as a soloist was held in Istanbul in 1953. The following year, at age 24, Bashir was first featured on Iraqi television. By 1957, he had embarked on several tours across most European countries. However, the difficult political situation in his country, and the resulting challenges it posed for working musicians, ultimately forced him to leave Iraq permanently.

===Budapest===
In the early 1960s, following a brief stay in Beirut, Bashir settled in Budapest, which he would call home for the rest of his life. He married a Hungarian woman, and in 1970, their son Omar was born in the Hungarian capital. Omar would later follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, recording many duets with his father and becoming a renowned oudist in his own right.

Bashir was particularly attracted to Budapest not only for its status as a European musical metropolis, but also for the opportunity to study at the renowned &quot;Franz Liszt Conservatory&quot; under the supervision of Zoltán Kodály. Kodály was famous for his collaboration with Béla Bartók in preserving traditional Hungarian folk songs, and shared Bashir&#x27;s commitment to safeguarding indigenous musical heritage. Bashir studied at the conservatory and completed his doctorate in musicology in 1965. 

Following Kodály&#x27;s passing in 1967, Bashir briefly returned to Beirut. However, he found himself disillusioned by the evolution of Arabian music, which he perceived as deteriorating and becoming increasingly commercialized due to the mishandling of Western influences. Dismayed by these trends, which he attributed to popular singers, Bashir declined to accept engagements from them.

===Ambassador of Iraqi music===
In 1973, the Iraqi Ministry of Information appointed Bashir to its culture committee. This was at a transitional time in Iraqi history, as the regime of the Ba&#x27;ath party was not yet firmly established. The party saw Bashir as a unifying cultural figure who could appeal to and integrate the Christian minority. Bashir presented himself as apolitical, and owing to his international popularity, he was deemed a suitable representative for the diverse ethnic, religious, and political groups of Iraq. Bashir enjoyed this position even throughout the shifting political landscape: for instance, in 1981, even when Saddam Hussein was in power and the influence was shifting towards the Sunnis, the government still supported the establishment of Bashir&#x27;s &quot;Iraqi Traditional Music Group&quot;, which was dedicated to showcasing the diversity of Iraqi culture.

In 1987, during the Iran–Iraq War, Bashir realized a lifelong dream: he organized the inaugural &quot;Babylon International Festival of dance, music, and theatre&quot;. which he led for several years.

However, Bashir rarely spent time in Baghdad and ultimately left Iraq after the First Gulf War in 1991. His guest performances, primarily in Europe, provided a broad and receptive audience, thereby offering an excellent platform for showcasing his highly original and mature style of improvisation and composition. Most of his recordings were also made in Europe.

In his final years, he focused on establishing his son Omar as his musical successor. The two made several duo recordings together, including the particularly acclaimed *Duo de &#x27;ûd* album with Omar in February 1994, which is considered a classic of Bashir’s oeuvre due to its exemplary blend of traditional folk material with extensive improvisation. Omar later became established as a virtuoso oudist in his own right.

Munir Bashir passed away from heart failure in 1997 in Budapest at the age of 68, shortly before his scheduled departure for a tour in Mexico.

==Instrumental style==

===General characteristics===
Bashir is universally regarded as one of the most important oudists of the 20th century, as well as in the general history of the instrument. Bashir pioneered a distinctive sound on the oud, diverging sharply from the urban &quot;showmanship&quot; seen in the typical &quot;Egyptian&quot; style of Farid Al-Atrash, as well as the heavily jazz-influenced music of Lebanese artist Rabih Abou-Khalil, who enjoyed considerable popularity in Europe. Bashir instead pursued a more emotionally intimate style, which would eventually become his signature sound.

Bashir was particularly renowned for his mastery of solo improvisation (taqsīm) over the traditional modes (maqāmat) of Arabic music. His peers regarded him as an unparalleled virtuoso in this domain. Bashir was the first person to perform solo concerts featuring only the oud, which had previously been relegated to the realm of background accompaniment. Bashir&#x27;s pioneering role in this regard elevated the status of the oud to being one of the primary lead instruments of Middle Eastern music, and paved the way for many contemporary oudists to follow.

Throughout his musical journey, Bashir consistently challenged the stereotype that the oud was merely the Arabic version of the western &quot;campfire guitar&quot;. His efforts elevated the instrument&#x27;s status and expanded its musical possibilities.

===Tunings===
In many musical traditions, stringed instruments often employ various tunings to suit specific pieces. Bashir, following this practice, experimented extensively with different tunings. The standard tuning for the Arabic oud – distinct from its Turkish counterpart, which has a slightly different history – is typically:


Building on older traditions of the Iraqi oud school, including that of his elder brother, Munir Bashir developed a signature tuning that bears his name:

A notable feature of this tuning is the duplication of the highest course in F with an additional course tuned an octave lower. This innovation creates a rich, full sound in the high melody course, aligning with Bashir&#x27;s focus on melodic forms.

The Bashir school further developed another tuning variation that incorporates an F-course on the bass strings, which tuned an octave lower than in the previous example. Optionally, two F-strings can be added, tuned an octave apart. This arrangement frames the melody course in the fingerboard&#x27;s center with bass courses, resulting in a remarkably full sound and enabling unique melodies. However, this complex tuning system demands exceptional picking technique from the musician.

===Picking technique===
Like other lute-family instruments (such as the mandolin and sitar), the oud is played by plucking the strings with a plectrum (pick). In Arabic, this pick is called a &quot;risha&quot;, which historically was crafted from the pin feather of an eagle. Bashir was particularly known for having meticulous picking technique with the risha, emphasizing a clean and nimble technique, in contrast to the &quot;heavier&quot; approach favored by many other oud players at the time.

Bashir was particularly known for his ability to perform rapid, asymmetrically accented melodies on the instrument in a precise and fluid manner. Such melodies and complex rhythms are commonplace within traditional Arabic music, which places greater emphasis on such complex rhythmic patterns than European music. However, prior to Bashir, such virtuosity was rarely seen on the oud, due in part to the limitations of traditional technique: the location of the risha in the palm and the doubled strings can lead to considerable difficulty in playing such parts cleanly on the instrument. Bashir&#x27;s innovative technique made it possible to play these kinds of lines on the oud, to the extent that such ability today is often seen as a hallmark of virtuosity in modern oud playing. Bashir&#x27;s exceptional picking skills are especially evident in his ability to perform these techniques in fast, complex meters like 10/8 metre with seemingly effortless virtuosity, hiding the significant challenges in this method.

The ability to play such melodic lines on the instrument is 
Bashir&#x27;s approach to foreign musical forms is also reflected in his experimentation with alternative picking techniques. He incorporated fingerpicking, a technique cultivated in guitar playing – especially in flamenco – as a key element of his mature style. However, after brief experimentation, he abandoned the use of a thumb-plectrum (&quot;mezrab&quot;), a technique he encountered during his studies of the Indian sitar.

===Improvisation===
Bashir&#x27;s improvisations were steeped in the Arabic tradition of taqsim, or musical improvisation within the Arabic maqam modal system. In taqsim, the musician creatively brings out the sound of one or mote maqams by playing a sequence of structured melodic lines that bring out the important sub-chords or &quot;ajnas&quot; of the maqam and establish its unique characteristic sound. The taqsim typically follows certain thematic guidelines of development, within which the musician is free to explore or sometimes depart if they so wish. One may draw a comparison to traditional jazz improvisation, which also takes place within the guidelines of traditional jazz standards, song forms, and so on. The criteria of taqsim are different from other musical traditions, but just as artful.

Bashir was known for having a certain &quot;vocabulary&quot; of melodic phrases he would tend to play, sometimes referred to as bashirisms. Part of the art of taqsim also involves embellishment of traditional melodies or familiar melodic fragments, also commonplace in jazz improvisation and referred to as quoting. Within this tradition, these &quot;bashirisms&quot; have become commonplace and recognizable to Arabic musicians, and are sometimes quoted, in the same way that Western jazz musicians are easily able to recognize and quote melodic ideas characteristic of Charlie Parker or Louis Armstrong.

===Extended Playing Techniques===
The oud belongs to the family of short-scale lutes. The widest interval that can be played between the open string and the end of the oud fingerboard is a fifth (quint), although it is possible to play higher intervals on the same string by playing harmonics or flageolets on the open strings. Bashir introduced the use of harmonics into oud technique, which later become standard practice on the instrument.

Although the use of harmonics is fairly common in string instruments, it was not in common use as a standard part of oud technique. While Bashir did not invent this slightly unorthodox technique, he was known for integrating it into his style exceptionally well, expanding the expressive range of the oud.

===Foreign Influences===
Bashir, despite being a fierce advocate for the preservation of traditional Arabic music, was also highly interested in incorporating ideas from other musical traditions of the world into his own compositions. Bashir was known for having a comprehensive knowledge of ethnomusicology, with a particular emphasis on (Northern Indian music), European music, and particularly Spanish Flamenco music, elements of which he sought to include in his own music. Bashir sought above all else to avoid merging these styles in a superficial or disjointed way, eschewing simple &quot;quotations&quot; of foreign melodies in favor of a deeper approach that would fuse the tonalities involved in a natural and coherent way.

A noted example of Bashir&#x27;s innovative approach to musical fusion is his composition &quot;Al-Amira al-Andaluciyya&quot; (&quot;The Princess of Andalusia&quot;), which can be heard on a duo recording with his son Omar. The piece opens with a motif that would be highly unusual in traditional Arabic music:


The opening C-major arpeggio (motif a) would be unremarkable in European music, but on the oud it represents an extraordinary musical gesture, as such major triads are not typically used in Arabic music. The subsequent play around the note C (motif b) alludes to the musical connotation of Andalusia (for centuries a province of the caliphate and the birthplace of flamenco) that Bashir intended.

With just two notes (D and B), the major triad transforms into the Phrygian mode, which is fairly characteristic within Spanish flamenco music. The tremolo-like ornamentation of the leading D further enhances this effect. The descending line to G (motif c) then establishes the key for the following improvisation, which is set in a traditional Arabic maqam called &quot;Hijaz Kar Kurd&quot;. This maqam has the following (simplified) structure:


The highly asymmetric structure of this scale is less common in European music - but familiar to Arabic music, where it necessitates a approach to building ascending and descending melody lines. It&#x27;s well-suited for flamenco-like improvisations, as the flamenco style is characterized by an ambivalent and unstable relationship to major/minor tonality - which, in turn, is foreign idea to Arabic music, which doesn&#x27;t have triadic harmony. Bashir&#x27;s dovetailing of these two styles is characteristic of his compositions around this time.

As the improvisation progresses, Bashir further fuses the styles by playing numerous chords, or &quot;rasgueados&quot;. These are an indispensable stylistic element of flamenco guitar - but very rare on oud, which is fretless and thus challenging to play with the correct intonation - limitations which Bashir again sought to surpass in his fusion of the two styles.

==Influences and Reception==

===Relevance to Arabic Music===
Munir Bashir emerged on the scene at a particularly difficult time in the history of Arabic music. Due to his professional experiences, he was more aware of these difficulties than many of his colleagues, who often tended to accept their working conditions with resignation. British historian Bernard Lewis refers to Bashir as an example of a Middle Eastern musician who understood how to engage with Western culture on the basis of equal collaboration. Bashir sought and found new possibilities of musical expression by upholding the traditions of Arabic music and by exploring older forms.

On a more technical level, Bashir contextualized his improvisations within &quot;maqamat&quot;, some of which were never used outside of Iraq or had fallen into obscurity during the 20th century.

===Criticism===
Bashir&#x27;s integration of foreign stylistic elements led to misunderstandings and criticism from traditionalists. Music journalist Sami Asmar reported that Bashir was accused of pandering to his Western audience by preferentially using simpler &quot;maqamat&quot;. Specifically, it was claimed that Bashir misused &quot;maqam Rast&quot; and &quot;Shadd Araban&quot; in this way.

It is true that &quot;maqam Rast&quot; is a fundamental scale in Arabic music, perhaps taking a similar role to the major scale in Western music. However, the intonation of Rast is very unfamiliar to Western listeners, being essentially the major scale with the E and B notes flattened by a quarter tone - or the Dorian mode with the Eb and Bb raised by a quarter tone. This scale, and the use of these quarter-tone alterations in particular, make this scale sound highly unusual to Western ears. A similar situation holds for &quot;Shadd Araban&quot;, which features the use of two augmented second intervals, which is also very rare within Western music.

Thus, many feel these criticisms are not well-founded and unsupported by Bashir&#x27;s recordings or live performances, which do not show much preference for the two aforementioned scales. Instead, Bashir often preferred scales that allowed for significant melodic freedom and tonal ambivalence, which can be challenging for European ears accustomed to harmony—such as the &quot;Hijaz Kar Kurd&quot;, as mentioned earlier.

==Honours==
Bashir, especially in his latter years, received international honors for his musical opus and his engagement for the dialog of cultures. Amongst others he was vice president of the UNESCO International Music Council, knight of the French Legion of Honour, and secretary general of the Arabian music academy in Baghdad.

<text>The first USS &quot;Pawnee&quot; was a sloop-of-war in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. She was named for the Pawnee Indian tribe.

&quot;Pawnee&quot; was laid down in 1858 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched 8 October 1859, sponsored by Miss Grace Tyler; and commissioned 11 June 1860, Commander H. J. Hartstene in command.

==Service history==

===Home Squadron, 1860===
After shakedown, she departed Philadelphia 24 September with Captain Garrett J. Pendergrast embarked to assume command of the Home Squadron operating off the coast of Mexico. She arrived off Vera Cruz 15 October, and, after a short cruise, returned to Philadelphia 12 December.

===Civil War, 1861–1865===
&quot;Pawnee&quot; spent the first three months of 1861 in Washington, D.C., and was sent on an expedition to Charleston, South Carolina 6 April to relieve Major Robert Anderson&#x27;s garrison at Fort Sumter. Delayed by a severe storm, she arrived only to find that the Fort had been surrendered to Confederate forces. She returned to Washington and was immediately dispatched to Norfolk to secure the ships and stores of the Gosport Navy Yard. Arriving at Norfolk the night of 20 April, she found that all ships, save , had been scuttled, so an attempt was made to destroy the Naval stores and the dry dock. Their efforts were largely unsuccessful, but she assisted the tug &quot;Yankee&quot;, which towed the frigate &quot;Cumberland&quot; out of the Yard and saved the ship.

From May to August 1861 &quot;Pawnee&quot;, based at Washington, operated on the Potomac River, furnishing protection for surveying parties, bombarding Confederate shore batteries, convoying vessels and performing general blockade duty. On 24 May a party from the ship demanded and received the surrender of Alexandria, Virginia. One of &quot;Pawnee&#x27;s&quot; crew, Captain of the Maintop John Williams, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Mathias Point in June 1861.

In August &quot;Pawnee&quot; joined the Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads and sailed on the 26th for the North Carolina coast. There she participated in the attacks on Forts Hatteras and Clark (28–29th), which capitulated and were occupied by U.S. troops. &quot;Pawnee&quot; remained at Hatteras Inlet until 3 October, capturing four prizes and retaking two vessels previously captured by the Confederates.

On 29 October &quot;Pawnee&quot; sailed from Hampton Roads on a joint military-naval expedition to Port Royal Sound on the South Carolina coast, which resulted in the capture of an invaluable base for the Union blockade and future amphibious operations. During this engagement &quot;Pawnee&quot; was struck by seven shells, which killed two of her crew.

During the following year &quot;Pawnee&quot; continued operations along the coast of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida often sending boat parties into the various rivers and sounds. She took part in the occupation of Fernandina, Florida 3 March 1862, and assisted in the operations on Stono River, South Carolina 28–30 May. Early in November she proceeded north for repairs, arriving Philadelphia on the 10th.

&quot;Pawnee&quot; departed Philadelphia 6 January 1863, took ironclad in tow at Hampton Roads, and arrived off Port Royal, South Carolina 10 February. For the remainder of the war, she operated with the South Atlantic Squadron in coastal reconnaissance off the southern states, engaging shore installations, and watching for blockade runners. Between 1 February and 18 June 1864, she assisted in the capture of Confederate steamers &quot;General Sumter&quot; and &quot;Hattie Brock&quot; along with their valuable cargoes of cotton, turpentine, rosin and railroad iron. She also participated in the expeditions on Stono River, 1–10 July 1864 and Broad River 29 November 1864.

On 9 February 1865, &quot;Pawnee&quot; accompanied by and , ascended the Togoda Creek, North Edisto, South Carolina and engaged three Confederate batteries, driving the enemy from their earthworks. On 23 February, along with other ships, she occupied Georgetown, South Carolina. &quot;Pawnee&quot; returned to Washington, D.C., on 21 June and proceeded to Portsmouth where she decommissioned 26 July 1865.

===South America, 1867–1869===
In 1866 she was repaired for further service and she recommissioned 2 January 1867. Sailing from Portsmouth 24 April, she joined her squadron off Rio de Janeiro and operated in that area for two years protecting American citizens and their property during the war between Brazil and Paraguay. On 17 May 1869, she sailed for home, arrived Portsmouth 9 July, and decommissioned 22 July.

===Hospital ship and storeship, 1870–1882===
Following a survey, &quot;Pawnee&#x27;s&quot; machinery was removed and she was fitted out as a sailing ship. She transferred to Norfolk, Virginia 6 December 1869 where she was converted to a hospital and storeship. She recommissioned 17 December 1870 and sailed 7 January 1871 for the Gulf of Mexico.

Stationed at Key West, Florida, &quot;Pawnee&quot; served as a hospital ship and receiving ship for the North Atlantic Station until April 1875 when she was towed to Port Royal, South Carolina for use as a storeship.

She decommissioned 18 November 1882 and was struck from the Navy Register. On 3 May 1884 &quot;Pawnee&quot; was sold to M. H. Gregory, Great Neck, New York.

<doc id="1170324" wikidata="Q157326" url="?curid=1170324" title="Miguel Delibes">
<text>Miguel Delibes Setién (; 17 October 1920 – 12 March 2010) was a Spanish novelist, journalist and newspaper editor associated with the Generation of &#x27;36 movement. From 1975 until his death, he was a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, where he occupied letter &quot;e&quot; seat. Educated in commerce, he began his career as a cartoonist and columnist. He later became the editor for the regional newspaper &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot; before gradually devoting himself exclusively to writing novels.

He was a connoisseur of the flora and fauna of Castile and was passionate about hunting and the countryside. These were common themes in his writing, and he often wrote from the perspective of a city-dweller who remained connected with the rural world.

He was one of the leading figures of post-Civil War Spanish literature, winning numerous literary prizes. Several of his works have been adapted into plays or have been turned into films, winning awards at the Cannes Film Festival among others. He has been ranked with Heinrich Böll and Graham Greene as one of the most prominent Catholic writers of the second half of the twentieth century. He was deeply affected by the death of his wife in 1974. In 1998 he was diagnosed with colon cancer, from which he never fully recovered. He died in 2010.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and training ===
Miguel Delibes was born in Valladolid on 17 October 1920, the third of eight children from the marriage between María Setién and Adolfo Delibes. His father was born and died in the Cantabrian town Molledo, where Miguel spent many summers. The writer was named an adopted son of Valladolid in 2009. The name &quot;Delibes&quot; was of French origin and came from Toulouse. Miguel&#x27;s grandfather was the brother of the French composer Léo Delibes, and had moved to Spain to participate in the construction of the railway in Cantabria. His father was a law professor at the Valladolid Business School. Miguel attended the College of Our Lady of Lourdes in Valladolid. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he enlisted in the Navy on the Nationalist side in 1938. He served on the cruiser Canarias, which operated in the Mallorcan region. At the end of the war in 1939, he returned to his home town, where he studied commerce and law. He then enrolled at the &quot;Escuela de Artes y Oficios&quot; (School of Arts and Crafts) of Valladolid, where he honed his artistic skills. In 1941 he secured a job as a cartoonist with the leading newspaper of Valladolid, &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot;.

On April 23, 1946, he married Ángeles de Castro, who later became one of his greatest literary inspirations. They spent their honeymoon in Molledo, Cantabria.

=== Early literary career ===
After his marriage, Delibes&#x27; literary career really started to take off, beginning a three-year period that defined his career. In 1947 he began writing his first novel, &quot;La sombra del ciprés es alargada (&quot;The cypress casts a long shadow), which won the &quot;Premio Nadal&quot; the following year, marking his emergence on the Spanish literary scene. His novel &quot;Aún es de día&quot; (It is still daytime) was published, heavily censored, in 1948.

His family grew during this same period. His son Miguel, who would later become a famous biologist, was born in 1947. His daughter Ángeles, who would also become a renowned biologist and researcher, was born the following year, and in 1949 his third child, Germán, was born.

In 1950, a new stage in the writer&#x27;s literary career commenced. After suffering a bout of tuberculosis, he published &quot;El camino&quot; (The road), his third novel. The novel tells the discovery of life and the experiences of a boy who moves from the countryside to the city. The work constituted his final consecration in the Spanish post-war narrative. That year saw the birth of his daughter Elisa, who later became a graduate of Hispanic and French Studies.

In 1952, he was appointed deputy director of the newspaper &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot;, and his battles with censorship became increasingly direct and frequent. The writer entered a new phase in his life in which he would publish a new work virtually every year, namely: &quot;Mi idolatrado hijo Sisí&quot; (My adored son Sissi) 1953, &quot;La partida&quot; (The departure) 1954, &quot;Diario de un cazador &quot;(Diary of a hunter) 1955 –&quot;Premio Nacional de Narrativa&quot;–, &quot;Un novelista descubre América&quot; (A novelist discovers America) 1956, &quot;Siestas con viento sur&quot; (Siestas with southern wind) 1957 –Fastenrath Award–, &quot;Diario de un emigrante&quot; (Diary of an emigrant) 1958, and &quot;La hoja roja&quot; (The red leaf), 1959. This last novel was existentialist in content and deals with a photographer who recalls his life on the brink of his retirement. In 1956, his son Juan Delibes was born. He would become a biologist like his siblings and fan of hunting and fishing like his father. In 1958, the writer was appointed director of &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot;.

=== Literary apogee ===

The 1960s represented the heyday of Delibes&#x27; literary career. The period was marked by the birth of his sixth son, Adolfo (later a graduate in biology) and a visit to Germany, where he visited several universities. The literary period opened with the publication of &quot;Viejas historias de Castilla la Vieja&quot; (Old Tales of Old Castile) in 1960, and&quot; Por esos mundos&quot; (In these worlds) in 1961. In 1962, Delibes published &quot;Las ratas&quot; (The Rats), one of his masterpieces. It constructs a story from a series of autobiographical anecdotes which evoke the rural environment of a Castilian village that has disappeared. The book won the &quot;Premio de la Crítica&quot; (Critics Award for Castilian fiction). In the same year Camino, the last of his seven children, would be born. Camino later graduated in Philosophy and Letters. Also in that year, the film version of &quot;El camino&quot;, directed by Ana Mariscal, was shot. 1963 was a turbulent year: Delibes resigned on June 8 as director of &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot; after several disagreements with Manuel Fraga, Minister of Information and Tourism. In 1964, he spent six months in the United States as a visiting professor in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature of the University of Maryland. After his return, he wrote and published &quot;Cinco horas con Mario&quot; (Five Hours with Mario), which is considered his masterpiece. The novel is the monologue of a woman who holds a wake for her late husband while she recounts the memories of him. Other books published upon his return from the US included &quot;USA y yo&quot; (The United States and I) and &quot;La milana&quot;. In the following years he visited Czechoslovakia and published &quot;Parábola del náufrago&quot; (literally: The Parable of the Castaway, translated into English as &quot;The Hedge&quot; by Frances M. Lopez-Morillas). Later in the 1970s, he followed up with several books about hunting, an activity about which he was passionate, and stories. Subsequently, he published &quot;Un año de mi vida&quot; (A Year of my Life), a personal diary.

On 1 February 1973, Miguel Delibes was elected to the Royal Spanish Academy, occupying chair &quot;e&quot;, which was left vacant after the death of Julio Guillén. That same year, in December, he was also elected to the Hispanic Society of America. Before the end of the year, he published&quot; El príncipe destronado&quot; (The dethroned prince), his eleventh novel. On 22 November 1974 his wife, Angela de Castro, died at the age of 50. Her death profoundly marked the writer for the rest of his life.

Finally, on 25 May 1975, he delivered his inaugural address to the Royal Spanish Academy. Damaso Alonso, one of the leading members of the Generation of &#x27;27 and then president of the Royal Spanish Academy handed the academic medal to Miguel Delibes His induction speech, which dealt with &quot;The meaning of progress from my work,&quot; which he later edited into a book entitled &quot;Un mundo que agoniza&quot; (A world that is agonizing). That same year, his twelfth novel &quot;Las guerras de nuestros antepasados&quot; (The Wars of our Ancestors) saw the light. In the next three years, he published several books on hunting and his only book about fishing,&quot; Mis amigas las truchas&quot; (My Friends the Trout). This time period closed with the publication of &quot;El disputado voto del señor Cayo&quot; (The Disputed Vote of Mr. Cayo), his thirteenth novel. In 1979, the stage adaptation of &quot;Five Hours with Mario&quot; premiered in Spain starring the leading actress of Valladolid, Lola Herrera. Due to its success, the play was revived several times. That year, he released &quot;Castilla, lo castellano, los castellanos&quot; (Castile, Castilian Culture, the Castilians), a narrative anthology.

=== 1980 and 1990: awards ===

In 1980, the International Booksellers Seventh Congress that was held in Valladolid paid tribute to the writer. The big title of this period was&quot; Los santos inocentes&quot; (The Holy Innocents), published in 1981. The book is a form of social radiography that recounts the degradation of a rural family through the actions of the &quot;caciques&quot; of rural Extremadura. In 1982, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature, sharing it with Gonzalo Torrente Ballester; and participated in the Congress &quot;A literature for man&quot;, held in Reggio Emilia, Italy. During this decade he published books on hunting, stories, and collections of newspaper articles. In 1983, he was inducted as Doctor honoris causa by the University of Valladolid. The following year, he was awarded the Castile and León Prize for Literature by the Regional Government. In the same year, Miguel Delibes was named &quot;author of the year&quot; by the Spanish booksellers who bestowed the Golden Book award on him in recognition. At the end of the year, &quot;The Holy Innocents&quot; was adapted into a film. The actors Alfredo Landa and Francisco Rabal received the actor&#x27;s award at the Cannes Film Festival for their roles in the movie. In 1985, he published &quot;El tesoro&quot; (The Treasure) and received the Knight of Arts and Letters of the French Republic. In the following years he was named a favorite son of Valladolid, he published &quot;Castilla habla&quot; (Castile Speaks), got an honorary doctorate of the Complutense University of Madrid and attended the theatrical adaptation of works like &quot;The Red Leaf&quot; and &quot;The Wars of our Ancestors&quot;. His 1987 book &quot;Madera de héroe&quot; (The Stuff of Heroes) deals with the notion of heroism during the Spanish Civil War. It won the Premio Ciudad de Barcelona.

On 7 May 1990, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Saarland University, Germany. A year later, on 30 May 1991, the Ministry of Culture awarded him the National Prize for Spanish Literature. The University of Málaga paid homage to him at the V Contemporary Spanish Literature Congress, under the title &quot;Miguel Delibes: the writer, his work and readers.&quot; That year, he published&quot; Señora de rojo sobre fondo gris&quot; (Lady in red on a grey background), a clear evocation of his wife. In the following year the &quot;Meeting with Miguel Delibes&quot; was held in Madrid. It was organized on the occasion of the National Prize for Spanish Literature and included a total of seven conferences and four round tables that dealt with the works of Miguel Delibes.

=== Literary halt and final years ===
His last major work, &quot;El hereje&quot; (The Heretic), a tribute to Valladolid, was published in 1998 and was awarded the National Literature Prize for Narrative. When receiving the award, the author stated that at 79 years of age he &quot;had hung up his writing tackle.&quot; At the beginning of the millennium, the Miguel Delibes Chair was founded. The chair has its seat at the universities of New York and Valladolid, and has as its objectives to promote the study of contemporary Spanish literature, make this literature known in the United States and disseminate it through new technologies.

Following the publication of &quot;The Heretic&quot; his writing career came virtually to a halt, mainly because of the colon cancer that affected the writer during the final phase of writing his last great novel. He was largely disabled and fell victim to an ever-greater apathy. His last book, &quot;La tierra herida&quot; (The wounded earth) published in 2005, takes the form of a dialogue between him and his eldest son, Miguel Delibes, former head of Doñana National Park. The book is a moving account of climate change. In 2007 he received the Quijote Prize for Spanish Literature, although in later years his literary production was practically nil, with just a few titles, such as &quot;De Valladolid &quot;(From Valladolid). Since he was disabled, Juan Carlos I and Sofia of Greece, the king and queen of Spain, personally visited the writer at his home in Valladolid after he was awarded the Vocento Prize for Human Values. He was recognized by his city with the creation of the Route of the Heretic based on his novel and the construction of the &quot;Centro Cultural Miguel Delibes&quot;, which is both a conservatory and auditorium as well as a convention center.

The president of the autonomous community of Castile and León gave him in November 2009 the Gold Medal of Castile and León in recognition of &quot;his defense of Castilian&quot; and described the author as a &quot;master storyteller&quot;.
Similarly, the Junta of Castile and León, as well as numerous Spanish and international cultural and intellectual institutions proposed him repeatedly as a candidate for the Nobel Prize, the last time by the Society of Authors and Publishers in 2010 along with Ernesto Cardenal and Ernesto Sabato.

=== Politics ===

Although Delibes fought with the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War, he was appalled by the level of repression, turned against Franco, and worked to restore democracy to Spain. In 1963, he was forced to resign from his position as director of the newspaper &quot;El Norte de Castilla&quot; for refusing to follow official instructions limiting the freedom of the press. In Delibes&#x27;s view, the Reformation had enriched the Catholic faith. He held the opinion that the Spanish Civil War could&#x27;ve been avoided if the Church had a reformist pope like John XXIII who reconciled with modernity at the time. He has been described as a liberal Catholic, who sought to find a middle ground in between liberation theology and the authoritarian Catholicism of Franco.

=== Death ===
 
During the early days of March 2010 his health worsened, and on 11 March, the writer was in critical condition, conscious but heavily sedated, and his family expected his death within hours. Miguel Delibes finally died at his home in Valladolid early in the morning of March 12, 2010, at the age of 89 years as a result of the colon cancer that was first diagnosed in 1998. His funeral chapel was installed that morning in the reception room of the Town Hall of Valladolid. It was visited by such personalities as Lola Herrera, Concha Velasco, the Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, the President of Castile and León Juan Vicente Herrera and the Minister of Culture Ángeles González-Sinde, among others, as well as over 18,000 people.

His funeral was held in the morning of March 13 in the Cathedral of Valladolid. His remains were cremated and buried in the Pantheon of Illustrious Men of Valladolid among personalities such as José Zorrilla and Rosa Chacel. Valladolid City Council granted the privilege of moving the cremated remains of Ángeles, his wife, to that cemetery to bury with Delibes, thus honouring his long-expressed wish.

<text>The Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH, &quot;National Institute of Anthropology and History&quot;) is a Mexican federal government bureau established in 1939 to guarantee the research, preservation, protection, and promotion of the prehistoric, archaeological, anthropological, historical, and paleontological heritage of Mexico. Its creation has played a key role in preserving the Mexican cultural heritage. Its current national headquarters are housed in the Palace of the Marqués del Apartado.

INAH and the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura are tasked with cataloging and protecting monuments and buildings regarded as cultural patrimony. INAH is entrusted with &#x27;archaeological&#x27; (pre-Hispanic and paleontological) and &#x27;historical&#x27; (post-Conquest 16th to 19th centuries) structures, zones and remnants, while INBAL is entrusted with &#x27;artistic&#x27; buildings and monuments (properties that are of significant aesthetic value as deemed by a commission). Worthy edifices are catalogued in the &quot;Registro Público de Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicos e Históricos&quot; (Public Register of Archeological and Historic Monuments and Zones).

Currently, the INAH carries out its work through a Technical Secretariat which supervises the performance of its main duties and whose tasks are distributed among its seven National Coordination Offices and 31 Regional Centers throughout the states of the Mexico.

This bureau is responsible for the over 110,000 historical monuments, built between the 16th and 19th centuries, and for 29,000 of Mexico&#x27;s estimated 200,000 pre-Columbian archeological zones found throughout the country. One hundred and fifty of the archeological sites are open to the public.

The INAH also supervises over a hundred museums. These are found across the country and are categorized according to the extension and quality of their collections, geographical locations, and number of visitors. Over 500 Teotihuacan murals are in storage at the INAH.

<doc id="1170330" wikidata="Q6830735" url="?curid=1170330" title="Michael Gravelle">
<text>Michael Gravelle (born January 23, 1949) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who represented the riding of Thunder Bay—Superior North from 1995 to 2022 (known as Port Arthur from 1995 to 1999). He served as a member of cabinet during the Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne governments.

==Background==
Gravelle was born in Port Arthur, which is now a part of Thunder Bay, the son of Edmund Gravelle and Jan Shepherd. He was educated at the Port Arthur Collegiate Institute and Lakehead University, receiving a degree from the latter institution 1968. He was an assistant to Liberal politicians Robert Andras, Stuart Smith and Joe Comuzzi. He also worked as a publicist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and was a founder of the &quot;North of Superior Film Association&quot;.

==Politics==
Gravelle was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Shelley Wark-Martyn by almost 7,000 votes in the riding of Port Arthur. The election was won by the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and Gravelle joined 29 other Liberals in the opposition benches. He supported Dwight Duncan for the party leadership in 1996.

Gravelle was easily re-elected for the new riding of Thunder Bay—Superior North in the 1999 provincial election.

In the provincial election of 2003, Gravelle was re-elected with 72.5 per cent of the popular vote, the highest percentage total in the province. He was appointed caucus chair on November 25, 2003. In the 2007 election, he was returned by a much narrower margin, 46.8 to 38.3, against New Democrat candidate Jim Foulds.

On October 30, 2007, Gravelle was named Ontario Minister of Northern Development and Mines. In the summer of 2009, Gravelle&#x27;s ministry was expanded, adding on the responsibility of forestry. In 2011 he was shuffled to the position of Minister of Natural Resources. In February 2013, Kathleen Wynne moved him back to the position of Minister of Northern Development and Mines. He was reconfirmed in that role after the 2014 election.

He was re-elected in 2011, and 2014.

In February 2017, Gravelle temporarily stepped aside as minister because of his battle with depression; his duties were taken up by fellow cabinet minister Bill Mauro.

The Liberals were heavily defeated at the 2018 provincial election, and Gravelle was left as the only Liberal MPP in Northern Ontario.

In 2020, Gravelle announced that he would be seeking re-election, however, in April 2022 he announced that his previous cancer had returned, and later that month said that he was not able to run for re-election.
