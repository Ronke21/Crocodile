<text>Islam is a major religious minority in the Russian Federation, which has the largest Muslim population in Europe. According to the US Department of State in 2017, Muslims in Russia numbered 14 million or roughly 10% of the total population. One of the Grand Muftis of Russia, sheikh Rawil Gaynetdin, estimated the Muslim population of Russia at 25 million in 2018.

Recognized under the law and by Russian political leaders as one of Russia&#x27;s traditional religions, Islam is a part of Russian historical heritage, and is subsidized by the Russian government. The position of Islam as a major Russian religion, alongside Orthodox Christianity, dates from the time of Catherine the Great, who sponsored Islamic clerics and scholarship through the Orenburg Assembly.

The history of Islam and Russia encompasses periods of conflict between the Muslim minority and the Orthodox majority, as well as periods of collaboration and mutual support. Robert Crews&#x27;s study of Muslims living under the Tsar indicates that &quot;the mass of Muslims&quot; was loyal to that regime after Catherine, and sided with it over the Ottoman Empire. After the Russian Empire fell, the Soviet Union introduced a policy of state atheism, which impeded the practice of Islam and other religions and led to the execution and suppression of various Muslim leaders. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Islam regained a legally recognized space in Russian politics. Despite having made Islamophobic comments during the Second Chechen War, President Vladimir Putin has since subsidized mosques and Islamic education, which he called an &quot;integral part of Russia&#x27;s cultural code&quot;, and encouraged immigration from Muslim-majority former Soviet states.

Muslims form a majority of the population of the republics of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan in the Volga Federal District and predominate among the nationalities in the North Caucasian Federal District located between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea: the Circassians, Balkars, Chechens, Ingush, Kabardin, Karachay, and numerous Dagestani peoples. Also, in the middle of the Volga Region reside populations of Tatars and Bashkirs, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. Other areas with notable Muslim minorities include Moscow, Saint Petersburg, the republics of Adygea, North Ossetia-Alania and Astrakhan, Moscow, Orenburg and Ulyanovsk oblasts. There are over 8,000 registered religious Muslim organizations, equivalent to almost one fifth of the number of registered Russian Orthodox religious organizations of about 42,000 as of 2022.

==History==
In the mid-7th century AD, as part of the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam was introduced to the Caucasus region, parts of which were later permanently incorporated by Russia. The first people to become Muslims within current Russian territory, the Dagestani people (region of Derbent), converted after the Arab conquest of the region in the 8th century. The first Muslim state in the future Russian lands was Volga Bulgaria
(922). The Tatars of the Khanate of Kazan inherited the population of believers from that state. Later most of the European and Caucasian Turkic peoples also became followers of Islam. The Mongol rulers of the Golden Horde were Muslims from 1313. By the 1330s, three of the four major khanates of the Mongol Empire had become Muslim.

The Tatars of the Crimean Khanate, the last remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia and burnt down parts of Moscow in 1571. Until the late 18th century, the Crimean Tatars maintained a massive slave-trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Ukraine over the period 1500–1700.

From the early 16th century up to and including the 19th century, all of Transcaucasia and southern Dagestan was ruled by various successive Iranian empires (the Safavids, Afsharids, and the Qajars), and their geopolitical and ideological neighboring arch-rivals, on the other hand, the Ottoman Turks. In the respective areas they ruled, in both the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, Shia Islam and Sunni Islam spread, resulting in a fast and steady conversion of many more ethnic Caucasian peoples in adjacent territories.

The period from the Russian conquest of Kazan in 1552 by Ivan the Terrible to the ascension of Catherine the Great in 1762 featured systematic Russian repression of Muslims through policies of exclusion and discrimination - as well as the destruction of Muslim culture by the elimination of outward manifestations of Islam such as mosques. The Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the various regions to preach to the Muslims, particularly the Kazakhs, whom the Russians viewed with contempt. However, Russian policy shifted toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness. Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly élite Russian military institutions. In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing pan-Turkism, though many were persecuted as a result. The government of Russia paid Islamic scholars from the Ural-Volga area working among the Kazakhs

Islamic slavery did not have racial restrictions. Russian girls were legally allowed to be sold in Russian-controlled Novgorod to Tatars from Kazan in the 1600s by Russian law. Germans, Poles, and Lithuanians were allowed to be sold to Crimean Tatars in Moscow. In 1665, Tatars were allowed to buy Polish and Lithuanian slaves from the Russians. Before 1649, Russians could be sold to Muslims under Russian law in Moscow. This contrasted with other places in Europe outside Russia where Muslims were not allowed to own Christians.

The Cossack Hetmanate recruited and incorporated Muslim Mishar Tatars. Cossack rank was awarded to Bashkirs. Muslim Turkics and Buddhist Kalmyks served as Cossacks. The Cossack Ural, Terek, Astrakhan, and Don Cossack hosts had Kalmyks in their ranks. Mishar Muslims, Teptiar Muslims, service Tatar Muslims, and Bashkir Muslims joined the Orenburg Cossack Host. Cossack non-Muslims shared the same status with Siberian Cossack Muslims. Muslim Cossacks in Siberia requested an Imam. Cossacks in Siberia included Tatar Muslims like in Bashkiria.

Bashkirs and Kalmyks in the Imperial Russian Army fought against Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée during the French invasion of Russia. They were judged suitable for inundating opponents but not intense fighting. They were in a non-standard capacity in the military. Arrows, bows, and melee combat weapons were wielded by the Muslim Bashkirs. Bashkir women fought among the regiments. Denis Davidov mentioned the arrows and bows wielded by the Bashkirs. Napoleon&#x27;s forces faced off against Kalmyks on horseback. Napoleon faced light mounted Bashkir forces. Mounted Kalmyks and Bashkirs numbering 100 were available to Russian commandants during the war against Napoleon. Kalmyks and Bashkirs served in the Russian army in France. A nachalnik was present in every one of the 11 cantons of the Bashkir host which was created by Russia after the Pugachev Rebellion. Bashkirs had the military statute of 1874 applied to them. Muslims were exempt from military conscription during World War I.

While total expulsion (as practiced in other Christian nations such as Spain, Portugal and Sicily) was not feasible to achieve a homogeneous Russian-Orthodox population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims, making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region and encouraging emigration to other parts such as the Ottoman Empire and neighboring Persia, and almost annihilating the Circassians, Crimean Tatars, and various Muslims of the Caucasus. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighboring Ottoman Empire. The explicit Russian goal involved expelling the groups in question from their lands. They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire, in Persia, or Russia far from their old lands. The Russo-Circassian War ended with the signing of loyalty oaths by Circassian leaders on 2 June [O.S. 21 May] 1864. Afterward, the Ottoman Empire offered to harbor the Circassians who did not wish to accept the rule of a Christian monarch, and many emigrated to Anatolia (the heart of the Ottoman Empire) and ended up in modern Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, and Kosovo. Many other Caucasian Muslims ended up in neighboring Iran - sizeable numbers of Shia Lezgins, Azerbaijanis, Muslim Georgians, Kabardins, and Laks.
Various Russian, Caucasus, and Western historians agree on the figure of 500,000 inhabitants of the highland Caucasus being deported by Russia in the 1860s. A large proportion of them died in transit from disease. Those that remained loyal to Russia were settled into the lowlands, on the left bank of the Kuban&#x27; River. The trend of Russification has continued at different paces in the rest of Tsarist and Soviet periods, so that more Tatars lived outside the Republic of Tatarstan than inside it.

A policy of deliberately enforcing anti-modern, traditional, ancient conservative Islamic education in schools and Islamic ideology was enforced by the Russians in order to deliberately hamper and destroy opposition to their rule by keeping them in a state of torpor to and prevent foreign ideologies from penetrating in.

Communist rule oppressed and suppressed Islam, like other religions in the Soviet Union. Many mosques (for some estimates, more than 83% in Tatarstan) were closed. For example, the Märcani Mosque was the only acting mosque in Kazan at that time.

==Islam in the post-Soviet period==

There was much evidence of official conciliation toward Islam in Russia in the 1990s. The number of Muslims allowed to make pilgrimages to Mecca increased sharply after the embargo of the Soviet era ended in 1991. In 1995, the newly established Union of Muslims of Russia, led by Imam Khatyb Mukaddas of Tatarstan, began organizing a movement aimed at improving inter-ethnic understanding and ending lingering misconceptions of Islam among non-Muslim Russians. The Union of Muslims of Russia is the direct successor to the pre-World War I Union of Muslims, which had its own faction in the Russian Duma. The post-Communist union formed a political party, the Nur All-Russia Muslim Public Movement, which acts in close coordination with Muslim imams to defend the political, economic, and cultural rights of Muslims. The Islamic Cultural Center of Russia, which includes a madrassa (religious school), opened in Moscow in 1991. In the 1990s, the number of Islamic publications has increased. Among them are few magazines in Russian, namely: &quot;Ислам&quot; (transliteration: &quot;Islam&quot;), &quot;Эхо Кавказа&quot; (&quot;Ekho Kavkaza&quot;) and &quot;Исламский вестник&quot; (&quot;Islamsky Vestnik&quot;), and the Russian-language newspaper &quot;Ассалам&quot; (&quot;Assalam&quot;), and &quot;Нуруль Ислам&quot; (&quot;Nurul Islam&quot;), which are published in Makhachkala, Dagestan.
Kazan has a large Muslim population (probably the second after Moscow urban group of the Muslims and the biggest indigenous group in Russia) and is home to the Russian Islamic University in Kazan, Tatarstan. Education is in Russian and Tatar.
In Dagestan there are number of Islamic universities and madrassas, notable among them are: Dagestan Islamic University, Institute of Theology and International Relations, whose rector Maksud Sadikov was assassinated on 8 June 2011.

Talgat Tadzhuddin was the Chief Mufti of Russia. Since Soviet times, the Russian government has divided Russia into a number of Muslim Spiritual Directorates. In 1980, Tazhuddin was made Mufti of the European USSR and Siberia Division. Since 1992, he has headed the central or combined Muslim Spiritual Directorate of all of Russia.

In 2005, Russia was granted the status of an observer state in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation

Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Orthodox Christianity is much closer to Islam than Catholicism is.

A chain e-mail spread a hoax speech attributed to Putin which called for tough assimilation policies on immigrants, no evidence of any such speech can be found in Russian media or Duma archives.
Islam has been expanding under Putin&#x27;s rule. Tatar Muslims are engaging in a revival under Putin.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Russian Muslims are split regarding the [Russian] intervention in Syria, but more are pro- than anti-war.&quot;

The Grand Mufti of Russia, Talgat Tadzhuddin and other Russia&#x27;s Muslim leaders supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Chechnya&#x27;s Kadyrovite forces have fought alongside the Russian forces in Ukraine.

After a Quran burning incident that happened in Sweden during Eid al-Adha, Russian president Vladimir Putin defended the Quran by stating that It&#x27;s a crime in Russia to disrespect the Quran and other holy books.

===Islam in the North Caucasus===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Northern Caucasus experienced an Islamic (as well as a national) renaissance. Also radical and extremist streams of Islam started taking root, initially in western (upland) Dagestan. 

In 1991, Chechnya declared independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian Army forces were commanded into Grozny in 1994, but, after two years of intense fighting, the Russian troops eventually withdrew from Chechnya under the Khasavyurt Accord. Chechnya preserved its &quot;de facto&quot; independence until 1999. However, the Chechen government&#x27;s grip on Chechnya was weak, especially outside the ruined capital Grozny. The areas controlled by separatist groups grew larger and the country became increasingly lawless. Aslan Maskhadov&#x27;s government was unable to rebuild the region or to prevent a number of warlords from taking effective control. The relationship between the government and radicals deteriorated. In March 1999, Maskhadov closed down the Chechen parliament and introduced aspects of Sharia. Despite this concession, extremists such as Shamil Basayev and the Saudi-born Islamist Ibn Al-Khattab continued to undermine the Maskhadov government. In April 1998, the group publicly declared that its long-term aim was the creation of a union of Chechnya and Dagestan under Islamic rule and the expulsion of Russians from the entire Caucasian Region. This eventually led to the invasion of militants in Dagestan and the start of the Second Chechen War in 1999. The Chechen separatists were internally divided between the Islamic extremists, the more moderate pro-independent Muslim Chechens and the traditional Islamic authorities with various positions towards Chechen independence. An interim Russian-controlled administration was imposed in Chechnya in 2000, headed by the ex-Mufti and, therefore, religious leader of Sufism, Akhmad Kadyrov. Encouraged by the Russian strategy of using the traditional Islamic structures and leaders against the Islamic extremists, there was a process of religious radicalisation in Chechnya and other Northern Caucasus regions. 

At the end of the Second Chechen War, in 2005, Chechen rebel leader, Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, decreed the formation of a Caucasus Front against Russia, among Islamic believers in the North Caucasus, in an attempt to widen Chechnya&#x27;s conflict with Russia. After his death, his successor, Dokka Umarov, declared continuing jihad to establish an Islamic fundamentalist Caucasus Emirate in the North Caucasus and beyond. Insurgency in the North Caucasus continued until 2017. The police and the FSB carried out mass arrests and used harsh interrogation techniques. Some of those who closely followed the teachings of Islam have lost their jobs; mosques have also been closed. 

Russian president Vladimir Putin has allowed the de facto implementation of Sharia law in Chechnya by Ramzan Kadyrov, including polygamy and enforced veiling.
There was large anger from mostly Muslims from the Caucasus against the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in France. Putin is believed to have backed protests by Muslims in Russia against Charlie Hebdo cartoons and the West.

===Demographics and Branches===
More than 90% of Muslims in Russia adhere to Sunni Islam of the Hanafi and Shafi&#x27;i schools. In a few areas, notably Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia, there is a tradition of Sunni Sufism, which is represented by Qadiriyya, Naqshbandi and Shadhili orders. Naqshbandi–Shadhili spiritual master Said Afandi al-Chirkawi received hundreds of visitors daily.

About 10%, or more than two million, are Shia Muslims, mostly of Twelver Shi&#x27;ism branch. At first, they are the Azeris, who historically and still currently been nominally followers of Shi&#x27;a Islam, as their republic split off from the Soviet Union, significant number of Azeris immigrated to Russia in search of work. In addition to them, some of the indigenous peoples of Dagestan, such as the Lezgins (a minority) and the Tats (a majority), are Shias too. Nizari Isma&#x27;ili Muslims—another Shia branch—are represented only by the Pamiris, migrants from Tajikistan.

There is also an active presence of Ahmadis.

In 2021, Putin announced that some 20% of Russian aviation industry employees are Muslims.

=== Conversions ===
Most Muslims in Russia belong to ethnic minorities but in the recent years there have been conversions among the Russian majority as well, one of the country&#x27;s main Islamic institutions, the Moscow-based &quot;Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Russian Federation&quot; (DUM RF) estimating the ethnic Russian converts to number into the &quot;tens of thousands&quot; while some converts themselves give numbers between 50,000 and 70,000.

===Hajj===
A record 18,000 Russian Muslim pilgrims from all over the country attended the Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia in 2006. In 2010, at least 20,000 Russian Muslim pilgrims attended the Hajj, as Russian Muslim leaders sent letters to the King of Saudi Arabia requesting that the Saudi visa quota be raised to at least 25,000–28,000 visas for Muslims. Due to overwhelming demand from Russian Muslims, on 5 July 2011, Muftis requested President Dmitry Medvedev&#x27;s assistance in increasing the allocated by Saudi Arabia pilgrimage quota in Vladikavkaz. The III International Conference on Hajj Management attended by some 170 delegates from 12 counties was held in Kazan from 7 – 9 July 2011.

===Language controversies===
For centuries, the Tatars constituted the only Muslim ethnic group in European Russia, with Tatar language being the only language used in their mosques, a situation which saw rapid change over the course of the 20th century as a large number of Caucasian and Central Asian Muslims migrated to central Russian cities and began attending Tatar-speaking mosques, generating pressure on the imams of such mosques to begin using Russian. This problem is evident even within Tatarstan itself, where Tatars constitute a majority.

===Public perception of Muslims===
A survey published in 2019 by the Pew Research Center found that 76% of Russians had a favourable view of Muslims in their country, whereas 19% had an unfavourable view.

===Islam in Moscow===
According to the 2010 Russian census, Moscow has less than 300,000 permanent residents of Muslim background, while some estimates suggest that Moscow has around 1 million Muslim residents and up to 1.5 million more Muslim migrant workers. The city has permitted the existence of four mosques. The mayor of Moscow claims that four mosques are sufficient for the population. The city&#x27;s economy &quot;could not manage without them,&quot; he said. There are currently four mosques in Moscow, and 8,000 in the whole of Russia. Muslim migrants from Central Asia have had an impact on the culture with Samsa becoming one of the most popular take away foods in the city.

<doc id="1184491" wikidata="Q4781679" url="?curid=1184491" title="Apportionment Act of 1911">
<text>The Apportionment Act of 1911 (, ) was an apportionment bill passed by the United States Congress on August 8, 1911. The law initially set the number of members of the United States House of Representatives at 433, effective with the 63rd Congress on March 4, 1913. It also included, in section 2, a provision to add an additional seat for each of the anticipated new states of Arizona and New Mexico (which happened in 1912), bringing the total number of seats to 435.

==Previous apportionment==
To give effect to the requirements of Article One, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution and Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment that United States representatives be apportioned to the states in proportion to their respective populations, Congress would pass Apportionment Acts following each Census, starting with the Apportionment Act of 1792.

Prior to the Apportionment Act of 1911, the Hamilton/Vinton (largest remainder) method was used in the apportionment of seats since 1850. In addition to setting the number of U.S. Representatives at 435, the Apportionment Act of 1911 returned to the Webster method of apportionment of U.S. Representatives.

==Text==
==Subsequent apportionment==
For the first and only time, Congress failed to pass an apportionment act after the 1920 census. This left the allocations of the Act of 1911 in place until the 1930 census. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established a method for reallocating seats among the states, given population shifts and the maximum of 435 representatives. A 1941 amendment to the 1929 act made the apportionment process self-executing after each decennial census. This lifted Congress&#x27;s responsibility to pass an apportionment act for each census, and ensured that the events surrounding the 1920 census would not happen again. The number of U.S. Representatives increased temporarily to 437 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as states during the 86th Congress (seating one member from each of those states without changing the apportionment of the other seats). After the 1960 United States census and the 1962 election, that number went back to 435.

<doc id="1184492" wikidata="Q6390811" url="?curid=1184492" title="Kenneth Wang (politician)">
<text>Kenneth Xiaoxuan Wang (; born 1955) is a former Deputy Leader of the ACT New Zealand party.

==Biography==
Wang was born in China, and has three siblings. He arrived in New Zealand in 1984 and is married with two children. Wang worked in the marketing and advertising sector in Auckland. He was New Zealand&#x27;s second Chinese MP (with the first being Pansy Wong).

At the 2005 election, Wang contested the seat of Mt Roskill, and was seventh on ACT&#x27;s party list. However, he was not returned to Parliament.

In the 2008 general election, he stood unsuccessfully in the electorate of Botany for the ACT New Zealand Party. National candidate Pansy Wong filed a complaint to the electoral commission about Wang&#x27;s billboards which exhorted, &quot;Vote for Wang, get Wang and Wong&quot; (because Pansy Wong&#x27;s high rank on the National Party List assured her of a seat in parliament).

He was elected Deputy Leader of ACT in April 2014. Wang resigned as Deputy Leader on 9 July 2017, after expressing disappointment with his list placing and feelings that ACT had moved away from former policies that compelled him to join the party 15 years earlier.

Wang owns an advertising company in Auckland called &#x27;BananaWorks&#x27;.

==Member of Parliament==

He previously served as a member of Parliament to replace Donna Awatere Huata, who was expelled from Parliament in November 2004.

<doc id="1184496" wikidata="Q556034" url="?curid=1184496" title="Charlie Dent">
<text>Charles Wieder Dent (born May 24, 1960) is an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives for from 2005 to 2018.

Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Dent worked in a variety of occupations after graduating from Pennsylvania State University. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Lehigh University and served as an aide to Congressman Donald L. Ritter. From 1991 to 2004, he served in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. In 2004, Dent won election to the United States House of Representatives, succeeding Pat Toomey.

In the House, Dent became a member of the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership and the Tuesday Group. He became co-chair of the Tuesday Group in 2007. He served on the House Committee on Appropriations, and previously chaired the House Ethics Committee.

In September 2017, Dent announced that he would retire from Congress and not seek re-election to another term in 2018. In April 2018, Dent announced that he would retire in May 2018, not serving out the remainder of his term. He resigned on May 12, 2018, leaving the seat vacant.

==Early life and education==
Dent was born and raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the son of Marjorie L. (née Wieder) and Walter R. Dent. He is of German, English, and Irish descent. Dent is a 1978 graduate of Allentown&#x27;s William Allen High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s in international politics from Pennsylvania State University in 1982, and a masters in public administration from Lehigh University in 1993. He is a member of Phi Kappa Psi.

==Career==
Prior to pursuing elected office, Dent worked as a development officer at Lehigh University, an industrial electronics salesman, a hotel clerk, and an aide to U.S. Representative Donald L. Ritter.

===Pennsylvania legislature===
Before being elected to the United States Congress, Dent was a member of the State Legislature for 14 years. He represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 132nd house district from 1991 to 1999 after unseating Democratic incumbent Jack Pressman in a heavily Democratic district in 1990.

In 1998, Dent won an open 16th District Senate seat when Democrat Roy Afflerbach, who later served as Mayor of Allentown from 2002 to 2006, retired to take up an ultimately unsuccessful bid for Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

Dent was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004, succeeding Pat Toomey, who gave up his seat to challenge Arlen Specter for the U.S. Senate. He defeated Democrat Joe Driscoll 59%–39%.

====2006====

He won re-election 54%–44% against Charles Dertinger.

====2014====

====2016====

===Tenure===
Dent is a moderate Republican. The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Dent a composite ideological rating of 62% conservative and 38% liberal in 2013. The &quot;National Journal&quot; considered Dent to be one of the three most moderate Republicans in that year. GovTrack placed Dent near the ideological center of the House of Representatives; the liberal American Civil Liberties Union gave him a rating of 35% and the fiscally conservative United States Chamber of Commerce gave him a 95% rating. Dent was ranked as the 47th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fourth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

In 2014, Dent introduced a bill to give states more flexibility in how they provide health insurance to children from families between 100 and 133 percent of the federal poverty level, according to &quot;The Ripon Advance&quot;.

The Next Generation Choices Foundation selected Dent to be the Elsie Hillman Speaker at their annual National Cancer Prevention Day event in 2016 in recognition of his efforts to support legislation related to cancer prevention.

Before retiring, Dent voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position on legislation 93% of the time. After announcing his retirement during late 2017, he said that dealing with the &quot;freewheeling president&quot; became &quot;exhausting&quot;. According to &quot;The Hill&quot;, he said &quot;disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, intemperate statements&quot; were not &quot;conservative virtues&quot;. He delivered a farewell speech on May 10, and resigned on May 12, 2018, leaving the seat vacant.

===Political positions===
====Social policy====
In April 2011, after admitting that it was highly controversial, Dent voted along with the other Republican members of the House for a budget bill that would have abolished government-run Medicare. It proposed to make senior citizens purchase individual private health insurance using vouchers that would have covered only a part of their costs. The Congressional Budget Office found that privatizing Medicare under this plan would significantly increase the out-of-pocket costs to seniors; by 2030, the out-of-pocket share for standard medical expenses paid by a typical 65-year-old would have risen to 68% under the Republican plan, as opposed to 25% under the then existing Medicare system. The CBO found that the Republican bill would also have increased the budget deficit for at least a decade.

Dent voted against the 2007 Re-authorization of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Dent consistently opposed the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. However he broke with his party and voted against one of the Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare in 2017.

As a Republican who represented a district with Democratic leanings, he occasionally crossed party lines on legislation. On the issue of abortion and reproductive health care, Dent is a pro-choice Republican. In 2018, Planned Parenthood, which supports legal access to abortion and birth control, gave Dent a 41% lifetime score for voting with their positions and the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee, which opposes legal abortion, gave him a 50% rating in the same year. He co-sponsored legislation to fund embryonic stem-cell research and was one of the Republicans who broke with their party to support the use of embryos in research. Dent supported same-sex marriage. He cosponsored the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which would have banned employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and he voted to allow foreign same-sex partners to receive green cards. The Human Rights Campaign, which supports same-sex marriage and LGBT rights, gave him a 68% for their legislative scorecard. In December 2010, Dent was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; ban on openly gay service members.

====Citizenship and immigration====
In April 2010, Dent introduced a resolution urging the U.S. State Department to issue a Certificate of Loss of Nationality to Anwar al-Awlaki. He said al-Awlaki &quot;preaches a culture of hate&quot; and had been a functioning member of al-Qaeda &quot;since before 9/11&quot;, and had effectively renounced his U.S. citizenship by engaging in treasonous acts. Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen on September 30, 2011, and his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman was likewise killed two weeks later; both strikes were ordered by U.S. President Barack Obama. Al-Awlaki&#x27;s eight-year-daughter Nawar, also a U.S. citizen, was killed in a SEAL commando raid in Yemen on January 29, 2017. The raid was ordered by President Donald Trump. In it, a SEAL was killed and an Osprey aircraft was destroyed.

In January 2012, Dent co-sponsored the Enemy Expatriation Act with Senator Joe Lieberman. The bill&#x27;s purpose was &quot;To add engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States to the list of acts for which United States nationals would lose their nationality,&quot; where the term &quot;hostilities&quot; means any conflict subject to the laws of war. The proposal would allow the United States government to strip U.S. citizens of their citizenship without requiring that the citizen have been convicted of a crime.

Dent criticized President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods were devised. He stated that &quot;This is ridiculous. I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.&quot;

====Economy====
In 2005, Dent cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. Dent stated in 2018 that he would &quot;tuck&quot; his Export-Import Bank bill into the spending bill as an omnibus. The bill would &quot;lower the quorum on the board so it could approve large loans once more.&quot; As of 2018, the reopened bank had a seven-member board that lacked a quorum.

====Education====
At the start of the 112th Congress, Dent received a new position on the coveted House Appropriations Committee, and continued to serve on the House Ethics Committee. In June 2013, Dent decided to co-sponsor the Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA), a bill that would require schools and districts to adopt policies specifically prohibiting bullying and harassment against all students, including LGBT young people. Dent is known for his efforts to promote LGBT equality throughout the nation.

====Energy====
Dent is a proponent of hydrogen fuel and was one of the four founding members of the House Hydrogen Fuel Cell Caucus. In 2006, he proposed legislation aimed at promoting the rollout of commercial hydrogen fueling stations. He has spoken of his vision for the development of a &quot;Hydrogen Highway East&quot;, similar to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s plans for a Hydrogen Highway on the West Coast. Dent is a member of The Republican Main Street Partnership. In 2007 he was elected to co-chair the Tuesday Group, a centrist organization of Congressional Republicans.

====Drug policy====
Dent is a proponent of drug prohibition, and is outspoken on the dangers of novel synthetic drugs, having personally sponsored several bills aimed to schedule new psychoactive compounds. In 2011, he sponsored the Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2011, which sought to schedule a large number of cannabimimetic agents, as well as 26 other psychoactive substances. The bill passed the House but did not make its way through the Senate. On March 27, 2017, the bill was re-introduced as the Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2017. If passed in its current text (as of May 14, 2017), this bill would schedule a large number of novel psychoactive substances, including 96 phenethylamines, 94 cannabimimetic agents, 15 arylcyclohexylamines, 21 tryptamines, 8 benzylpiperazines, 4 benzodiazepines, 4 opioid or opioid-like substances, 8 piperazines, and 2 tropane alkaloids.

==Post-political career==
Following his resignation from Congress, Dent joined the law firm DLA Piper as a non-attorney policy adviser. He registered as a lobbyist following the mandatory one-year cooling off period.

On August 19, 2020, Dent announced his formal endorsement of Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for the 2020 presidential election, joining other Republicans such as Colin Powell, John Kasich, Christine Todd Whitman, Jeff Flake, Chuck Hagel, Susan Molinari and John Warner in choosing to vote for the Democrat in the election.

On July 6, 2022, Dent endorsed Democrat Josh Shapiro in the Pennsylvania Governor Election over Republican Doug Mastriano, claiming that Shapiro would &#x27;unite the state&#x27; and that Mastriano &#x27;is a threat to the rule of law&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Dent is married to Pamela Jane Serfass and has three children.

<text>Virginia Joan Kennedy ( Bennett, born September 2, 1936) is an American socialite. She was the first wife of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.

== Early life ==
Virginia Joan Bennett was born at Mother Cabrini Hospital in New York City. She was raised in a Roman Catholic family in suburban Bronxville, New York. Her parents were Virginia Joan Stead (1911–1976) and Harry Wiggin Bennett Jr. (1907-1981) Her father was a graduate of Cornell University and worked as an advertising executive. She grew up with one younger sister, Candace (&quot;Candy&quot;), born 1938. She attended Manhattanville College (then a Sacred Heart college), in Purchase, New York. Manhattanville was also the alma mater of her future mother-in-law Rose Kennedy and future sisters-in-law Jean Kennedy Smith and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. In 1982, Bennett received an MA in Education from Lesley College, now known as Lesley University. As a teenager, she worked as a model in television advertising.

== Marriage, family and divorce ==
In October 1957, at the dedication of a gymnasium at Manhattanville College in memory of another Kennedy sister, Kathleen – who had died in a plane crash in France in 1948 – Jean Kennedy Smith introduced Joan to her younger brother Edward ( Ted), then a student at the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville. The couple became engaged quickly and Joan grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know well. Joe Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed, and they were married on November 29, 1958, in Bronxville, New York. The small family wedding was held just a few weeks after Ted&#x27;s older brother U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy won his landslide re-election for his United States Senate seat representing Massachusetts in 1958. Joan had three children with Ted Kennedy: Kara Kennedy (1960–2011), Edward M. Kennedy Jr. (Ted Jr.) (b. 1961), and Patrick J. Kennedy (b. 1967).

Two of their children were cancer victims. Ted Jr. developed bone cancer at age 12, which resulted in the removal of a portion of his right leg in 1973, and Kara was treated for lung cancer in 2003; Kara died of a heart attack at age 51 on September 16, 2011.

Ted suffered a severe back injury in a 1964 airplane crash while campaigning for his first full Senate term. Joan assumed the full campaign-appearance schedule for his successful re-election in 1964. He had earlier won a special election in November 1962, to serve out the final two years of his brother John&#x27;s Senate six-year term; John had resigned from the U.S. Senate upon his November 1960 election as the 35th U.S. President.

In July 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in a car accident at a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts that resulted in the death of his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Although pregnant and confined to bed in the wake of two previous miscarriages, Joan attended Kopechne&#x27;s funeral. Three days later, she stood beside her husband in a local court when he pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. She suffered a third miscarriage shortly thereafter.

The couple separated in 1978 after twenty years of marriage. She subsequently told &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine about her alcoholism and her work to stay sober. They remained together officially married during his failed 1980 U.S. presidential campaign, later announcing plans to divorce in 1981; the divorce was finalized in 1983.

== Later life ==
In 1992, she published the book &quot;The Joy of Classical Music: A Guide for You and Your Family&quot;. Kennedy has worked with children&#x27;s charities, remains an accomplished pianist and has taught classical music to children.

Kennedy&#x27;s later years have been shaped by chronic alcoholism, which developed during her marriage. The alcohol problem escalated with sporadic, uneven sobriety, repeated drunk-driving arrests, court-ordered rehabilitation, and a return to drinking. This ultimately led to kidney damage, with the possibility of dialysis and protracted complications. In July 2004, her son, Ted Jr., was appointed her legal guardian; in 2005, her children were granted temporary guardianship. That year she was hospitalized with a concussion and a broken shoulder after being found lying in a Boston street near her home. In 2005, she requested that her second cousin, financial planner Webster E. Janssen of Connecticut, establish a trust to control her estate. This was in violation of her sons&#x27; guardianship. Her children later took successful legal action against Janssen, removing him as trustee and later filing a complaint against him with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery. She agreed to strict court-ordered guardianship and her estate has since been placed in a new trust overseen by two court-appointed trustees. her husband died in August 2009 of brain cancer at 77

Apart from a brief relationship shortly after her divorce, she has neither remarried nor pursued another relationship. She attended Ted&#x27;s funeral at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port. As of 2005, she resided in Boston, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod.

<doc id="1184539" wikidata="Q1312401" url="?curid=1184539" title="Fred Heineman">
<text>Frederick K. Heineman (December 28, 1929 – March 20, 2010) was an American law enforcement officer and politician who one term served as a Republican U.S. Congressman from North Carolina, serving in the 104th United States Congress from 1995 to 1997.

== Early life and career ==
Born in New York City, New York, Heineman attended Mt. St. Michael High School in The Bronx. He then studied at Concordia Junior College, Westchester Community College, the University of Bridgeport, St. Francis College, and John Jay College.

=== Military service ===
Heineman served in the United States Marine Corps from 1951 to 1954, and worked as a New York City police officer between 1955 and 1979.

=== Law enforcement ===
In 1979, Heineman came to Raleigh, North Carolina as that city&#x27;s chief of police. He served for 15 years, a time when Raleigh began an explosive period of growth that continues today. He promoted many women and minorities to senior positions for the first time, and cut a distinct figure with his thick New York accent.

== Congress ==
In 1994, he stepped down as chief of police and ran for Congress as a Republican against incumbent Democrat David Price, besting Price in the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot; of 1994. After a single term in the 104th Congress (January 3, 1995 – January 3, 1997), Heineman was defeated for re-election in 1996 by Price.

Two bills introduced by Heineman were passed by the House of Representatives: H.R. 1499, The Consumer Fraud Prevention Act of 1995 passed on September 25, 1996; and H.R. 3852, The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 passed on September 26, 1996. He also co-sponsored 174 bills during the 104th Congress. Heineman cast 1,287 votes (95.8%) and did not vote 56 times (4.2%).

He compiled an unshakably conservative voting record, with a lifetime record of 92 from the American Conservative Union. He came under fire when he claimed that despite making a combined $183,000 from his NYPD and Raleigh pensions and his congressional salary, he was part of the &quot;lower middle class.&quot; He further argued that anyone making between $300,000 and $750,000 was a member of the middle class.

Fred Heineman died on March 20, 2010, at his home in Raleigh.

<text>Thomas David Roe (born May 9, 1942) is an American rock and pop singer-songwriter.

Best-remembered for his hits &quot;Sheila&quot; (1962), &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; (1966) and &quot;Dizzy&quot; (1969), Roe was &quot;widely perceived as one of the archetypal bubblegum artists of the late 1960s, but cut some pretty decent rockers along the way, especially early in his career,&quot; wrote the AllMusic journalist Bill Dahl.

==Biography==

Roe was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where he attended Brown High School. After graduating, he landed a job at General Electric soldering wires.

Tommy Roe first recorded his original song &quot;Sheila&quot; in 1960 for Jud Phillips&#x27;s Judd label. &quot;I wrote this poem for a girl I had a crush on in high school, and her name was Freda,&quot; recalled Roe in 2015. &quot;[Jud Phillips said,] &#x27;Son, I like that song but we gotta do somethin&#x27; about that title.&#x27; So he sent me home and Aunt Sheila was visiting that weekend. The rest is history!&quot; The Judd single, misspelled &quot;Shelia&quot; and credited to &quot;Tommy Roe and the Satins,&quot; is simpler than the more famous hit, with a standard lead vocal, rhythm combo, and backing chorus. It was a regional hit but did not chart nationally.

Roe re-recorded the song for ABC-Paramount in 1962, with a new hook: an insistent drum paradiddle modeled on the 1957 hit &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;. Roe&#x27;s slight Southern accent and his interpolation of a hiccup in the vocal invited comparisons with Buddy Holly.

This was deliberate, according to Roe: &quot;Felton [producer Felton Jarvis] said, &#x27;We&#x27;re gonna do it different. You know there&#x27;s a vacuum left of Buddy Holly. There are still a lot of Buddy Holly fans out there so we need to draw attention to you, so I&#x27;m gonna put Buddy Holly drums on &quot;Sheila.&quot;&#x27; I wasn&#x27;t really crazy about that whole idea because I was a big fan of Buddy Holly&#x27;s and I felt like we were sponging off of him and his whole sound.&quot; The new arrangement of &quot;Sheila&quot; became a &quot;Billboard&quot; number 1 hit in the U.S. and Australia in 1962. A buildup of global sales of &quot;Sheila&quot; meant that the Recording Industry Association of America did not present the gold record until 1969. When &quot;Sheila&quot; became a hit in 1962, ABC-Paramount asked him to go on tour to promote the hit. He was reluctant to give up his secure job at GE until ABC-Paramount advanced him $5,000.
However, in March 1963, the UK music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that he and Chris Montez had both been upstaged by the Beatles and their fans on a 21-day UK tour. Late that year, Roe scored a Top 10 hit with &quot;Everybody&quot;, which reached US number 3 and UK number 9, and &quot;The Folk Singer&quot; (number 4 UK) written by Merle Kilgore was also popular.

Following a more successful tour of the United Kingdom by his friend Roy Orbison, Roe toured there and then moved to England where he lived for several years. In 1964, Roe recorded a song written by Buzz Cason entitled &quot;Diane From Manchester Square&quot;, about a girl who worked at EMI House when it was based in London&#x27;s Manchester Square. Sales of this single in the UK were poor, and it failed to chart. During the 1960s, he had several more Top 40 hits, including 1966&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; (number 8 U.S., #1 Canada) and &quot;Hooray for Hazel&quot; (number 6 U.S., #2 Canada).

In 1969, his song &quot;Dizzy&quot; went to number 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 1 in Canada. This chart-topper sold two million copies by mid-April 1969, giving him his third gold disc award.

Roe guest-starred in an episode of the American sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot;, titled &quot;The Four of Spades&quot;, airing on November 8, 1969.

His final Top 10 single, a track co-written with Freddy Weller, titled &quot;Jam Up and Jelly Tight&quot;, became his fourth gold record, peaking at number 8 in the U.S. and number 5 in Canada in 1970.

Although his style of music declined in popularity with the 1970s mass market, Roe maintained a following and continued to perform at a variety of concert venues, sometimes with 1960s nostalgia rock and rollers such as Freddy Cannon and Bobby Vee. He recorded numerous singles in the late 1970s and 1980s aimed at the country music market. In 1986, Roe was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

Roe&#x27;s autobiography, originally published in 2016, named &quot;From Cabbagetown to Tinseltown and places in between&quot;, was co-written with Michael Robert Krikorian.

On February 7, 2018, Roe officially announced his retirement on his Facebook page with this statement: 
On May 2, 2022, Roe released a new single titled &quot;80&quot; to commemorate his 80th birthday. Roe also appeared as a guest on several oldies-oriented podcasts throughout 2022 and 2023 to discuss his music career.

On January 5, 2023, Roe released a new album titled &quot;From Here to Here&quot; on the independent label Solar Music. In a February 2023 interview with &quot;Goldmine&quot;, Roe officially confirmed his return to music, stating &quot;Yes, I’m still at it. It is something that I love doing and it is part of my DNA. I have to do it. I guess I will carry on until I can’t do it anymore.&quot; On April 16, 2023, Roe announced concert dates for Nashville on May 9 and Holmdel on June 8, his first live performances since the 2018 retirement announcement.

<doc id="1184545" wikidata="Q21446402" url="?curid=1184545" title="Pierolapithecus">
<text>Pierolapithecus catalaunicus is an extinct species of primate which lived around 12.5-13 million years ago during the Miocene in what is now Hostalets de Pierola, Catalonia, Spain. Some researchers believe that it is a candidate for common ancestor to the great ape clade, or is at least closer than any previous fossil discovery. Others suggest it being a pongine, or a dryopith. On 16 October 2023, scientists reported the facial reconstruction of the great ape.

== History ==
The splanchnocranium was discovered in 2002 and systematic excavations took place during May and June 2003. The species was described by a team of Spanish paleoanthropologists led by Salvador Moyà-Solà on the basis of a fossil skeleton, IPS21350 (nicknamed Pau (&quot;peace&quot; in Catalan as it was announced alongside Spanish demonstrations against the Iraq War)), discovered in December 2002. The finding was first reported in the journal &quot;Science&quot; on November 19, 2004. The skeleton is of an adult male individual, composed of 83 bones that make up the splanchnocranium, both maxillae, a complete set of cheek teeth, both canines, a right central incisor, zygomatics, lacrimals, a partial frontal, carpals, metacarpals, manual phalanges from two hands, tarsals, metatarsals, pedal phalanges, right patellar distal epiphysis, a left radius, some long bone diaphyses, two pelvic pieces, three vertebrae, two intact ribs, and twelve rib fragments of large size. They named their new genus after the nearby village Els Hostalets de Pierola, and Catalonia respectively.

== Description ==
Moyà-Solà &quot;et al.&quot; initially founded the species on a set of unique characteristics, of which are the following. The frontal processes of the face remain on the same plane, the nasals are flat and sit beneath the lower rims of the orbit, the glabella is posteriorly oriented, the face is low, the brows are thin, the zygomatic root is high, and the nasoalveolar clivus is high. The rear border of the incisive foramen is in line with the P3, the palate is deep and stout, the nasal aperture is widest at the base, the interorbital distance is wide, the zygomatics expand to the side, the P3 is similar in size to the P4, there is reduced cusp heteromorphy, all molars save from the M3 are elongated, the upper molars and premolars lack cingula, the lingual cusps of the upper molars are positioned peripherally, the M2 is large and has cusp heteromorphy, and the upper canine is large and compressed in the crown. The ribs are very curved to form a thorax that is anteroposteriorly compressed, the clavicle is robust, lacking a ventral keel on the mid-lumbars, the pedicles of the neural arch are robust and stout, the spinous processes are slightly caudally inclined, the pedicle-body inserts the transverse processes, dorsally oriented and pedicle-born transverse process, the metacarpals and phalanges are short, the os centrale are unfused, the triquetrum is small and non-articulating with the ulnar styloid, and the crevice inserting meniscus attachment and pisiform facet is distally shifted.

The holotypic individual is estimated to have weighed 30 kg (66.13 lbs).

== Locomotion ==
Overall, the adduction and supination capacity of the wrist, specially built thorax, scapular shift to the back (which was inferred through the long, chimpanzee-like clavicles), and stiff lumbar vertebrae suggest that positional behavior and orthograde locomotion were emphasized. This type of movement is diagnostic for all extant apes including humans, but it is rarely documented in the fossil record. Other hominids that have this suite are &quot;Oreopithecus&quot; and, although less skeletally complete, &quot;Dryopithecus&quot;. Earlier taxa—&quot;Proconsul&quot;, &quot;Afropithecus&quot;, &quot;Equatorius&quot;, &quot;Nacholapithecus&quot;—retain basal characters and the similarly-aged &quot;Morotopithecus&quot; practiced orthograde locomotion but was probably sister to apes (based on facial structure). The shortened phalanges suggest ancestral palmigrade adaptations, but it is unlikely &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; practiced much or any suspensory behavior. However, vertical climbing and suspension are independent abilities that are integral to ape evolution. Below-branch suspension may have evolved repeatedly or in convergence later and independently in the ape lineage.

Further analysis suggests that very long and curved phalanges is decoupled with orthograde features related to vertical climbing being acquired. The condition in this genus is related to a retained pronograde plan. Although the lumbars, ribs, and carpals are orthograde, the degree of this in the phalanges is only slight. Many traits were independently acquired, leading to new advances being superimposed and basal characters retained for an extended time. &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; lacked adaptations for suspensory hanging, but it may have still been capable of doing so, only that it was not adaptively relevant. Although, the latter remains disputed.

The patella was like extant apes in dimensions, which is typically regarded as having a mobile knee. &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; differs from monkeys, hylobatids, and basal hominoids through thicker patellae. As such, a derived knee might be related to enhanced climbing, notably vertical climbing. The pelvis shares an ancestral template with &quot;Proconsul nyanzae&quot;, which was modified for orthograde behavior (assuming that hypothesis is accepted), and suggests homoplasy in ape pelves.

== Classification ==
&quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; demonstrates derived facial features and apelike skeletal adaptations that suggest that it is an early member of the ape clade. This genus, 12.5-13 mya in age, postdates the hylobatid-hominid split, which occurred anywhere from 14.9±2 or 14.6±2.6 mya. Much of the skeleton is derived, but the shortened phalanges are indicative of palmigrade adaptations that are primitive. This mosaic is important in ape evolution. The large amount of homoplasy in ape locomotion creates considerable taxonomic confusion. The late Middle Miocene is the farthest trace of a &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot;-like character group, and assuming that this identifies the earliest apes, is the farthest trace of hominids. As well, early hominids are substantially more primitive than estimated, which may explain why no early great apes were previously reported. These early traits would have been maintained, overlaid, and modified to suite new adaptations that occurred independently.

&quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; and &quot;Anoiapithecus&quot; may be synonymous with &quot;Dryopithecus&quot;, but both have enough craniofacial differences to justify separation. Placement as a basal hominid is supported by the comparison of the thick enamel from the afropithecids, which may be ancestral to apes. Other hypotheses are that the taxon represents a stem pongine. Rather than a full common ancestor, it has been suggested that the species may be ancestral to humans, chimpanzees and gorillas but not orangutans, given certain facial characteristics. This genus is distinguished from pongines and share traits with extant hominines, suggesting a sister relationship with &quot;Dryopithecus&quot; (possibly in a tribe called Dryopithecini, having thick and thin enamel much like &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;/australopiths and &quot;Pan&quot;/hominins). A reconstruction of the face of &quot;Pierolapithecus catalaunicus&quot; indicates its morphology as most consistent with a phylogenetic placement as a stem hominid.

== Paleoecology ==
&quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; bore thick enamel found in hard-object feeders, but its diet is not yet known aside from possibly having fed in trees like orangutans. It was discovered at the locality of BCV1, which formed when the northwestern Mediterranean rifted to form a stretch between two mountain ranges. The proximal to distal-marginal alluvial-fan sediments cover the Miocene. It was discovered as a fossiliferous area by Guerín in the 1920s with an ape M2 mistaken as a suid, followed by the discovery of &quot;Dryopithecus fontani&quot;, &quot;Hispanopithecus laietanus&quot;, and &quot;Sivapithecus occidentalis&quot; in the area. From the area hailing &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; specifically was explored from the 1950s–1970s from a garbage dump. 19 large and small mammals were discovered at the site, almost 300 macroinvertebrate fossils, and 83 hominid fossils (composing the holotype skeleton).

The fauna comprises the &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot;, megaherbivores like elephants, and various others like carnivores, artiodactyls, turtles, and small-medium fragments. &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; bears evidence of scavenging whereas the other fossils show signs of being scattered across an alluvial plain. The micromammals show signs of digestion by predators, probably by barn owls and others. The environment was quite humid, warm, and forested. The fauna is most like France and central Europe in composition. More insectivores, arboreal dormice, and flying squirrels support a humid environment, and the open woodlands of other sites would have made hominid occupation impossible.

That &quot;Pierolapithecus&quot; would be ancestral to modern great apes is debated largely because this great ape was found in the Iberian Peninsula, while most of the fossil evidence of the evolution of hominids and hominins has been located in East Africa and Southeast Asia. Because the Mediterranean Sea contracted several times in the past, migration of terrestrial fauna between Africa and Europe was permitted.

&quot;Pierolapithecus&quot;, like many other Miocene apes, is predicted to have been polygynous by its low second-to-fourth digit ratios, which are reflective of high prenatal androgen effects and correlated with polygyny in apes.

<doc id="1184551" wikidata="Q270189" url="?curid=1184551" title="Lerici">
<text>Lerici (, locally ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of La Spezia, in the Italian region of Liguria, part of the Italian Riviera. It is situated on the coast of the Gulf of La Spezia, southeast of La Spezia. It is known as the place where the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley drowned. The town is connected by ferry to the Cinque Terre and Porto Venere.

One of the main sights of Lerici is its castle which since its first founding in 1152 was used to help control the entrance of the Gulf of La Spezia. For a long time, the castle contained a museum of palaeontology inspired by a local lad (Walter) finding dinosaur bones in the region.

==History==
The origins of the town date back to the Etruscan period. In the Middle Ages the town came under Genoese control. After it had been sold to Lucca, it became involved in a series of conflicts between Genoa and Pisa, as it was on their common border. In 1479, the town came under Genoese sway for good.

==People==
Italian author Mario Soldati had a residence in the &quot;frazione&quot; of Tellaro.

Italian painter Oreste Carpi spent many years in San Terenzo making hundreds of paintings and drawings reproducing town landscapes.

English writers Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley lived some five kilometres north in an isolated old boathouse called Casa Magni and anchored their sailing boat in Lerici. Their closest neighbours were the villagers of the tiny hamlet of San Terenzo. Percy Bysshe Shelley drowned on 8 July 1822 in the Bay of Spezia, returning to Lerici from a journey to Livorno and Pisa. His corpse eventually washed up on the beach at Viareggio, located approximately halfway between Livorno and Lerici. Though the Italian poet and writer Sem Benelli first referred to the Golfo di Lerici, as the &quot;Golfo dei Poeti&quot; (Gulph of Poets) in 1910 to commemorate the death of Italian writer Paolo Mantegazza, (a famous Italian writer, neurologist, physiologist, and anthropologist) at his residence in San Terenzo di Lerici, the popularity of Lerici with the Shelleys and with Lord Byron helped promote the title Golfo dei Poeti, Poets&#x27; Bay, for the Golfo di Lerici.

Hungarian author Baroness Emmuska Orczy, author of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, had a villa built in the hills above Lerici, near the locality of Bellavista, and called it La Padula. Orczy and her husband Montague Barstow spent several months there in the 1930s – alternating between La Padula, Villa Bijou in Monte Carlo, and trips to Britain. Eventually, they decided to abandon fascist Italy for Villa Bijou. La Padula still stands today.

==Culture==
Lerici is one of the mariner communities which take part in the Palio del Golfo, a rowing contest held in La Spezia every first Sunday of August.

==Twin towns==
* Mougins, France, since 26 October 2008

Lerici is also twinned with Horsham, in England, although the latter no longer records this as an &quot;active&quot; twinning on its official website. Horsham is where Shelley was born, and Lerici is where he died.

<text>General elections were held in Romania on 27 September 1992, with a second round of the presidential election on 11 October. They were the first held after the adoption of a permanent constitution via a referendum held the previous winter.

Incumbent President Ion Iliescu led the field in the first round, but was forced into a run off with Emil Constantinescu, candidate of the oppositional Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR). Constantinescu ran on a quicker transition to a market economy and purging remaining communist influence from the government. He benefited from a marked downturn in Iliescu&#x27;s popularity tied to both high unemployment and concerns that Iliescu was wavering in his commitment to democracy.

Despite this, opinion polls ahead of the runoff suggested that Iliescu was favoured for a second full term. Not only was it believed that his 16-point first-round lead was too large for Constantinescu to overcome, but most of the minor candidates were expected to eventually offer their support to Iliescu in the second round. In the end, Iliescu was reelected with 61 percent of the vote. The 1992 Romanian presidential election was the second of its kind held in post-1989 Romania.

In the parliamentary election, Iliescu&#x27;s Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), which had split off from the National Salvation Front (FSN) earlier in the year, emerged as the largest party in Parliament, winning 117 of the 341 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 of the 143 seats in the Senate.

The first images from space were taken on sub-orbital flights. The US-launched V-2 flight on October 24, 1946, took one image every 1.5 seconds. With an apogee of 65 miles (105 km), these photos were from five times higher than the previous record, the 13.7 miles (22 km) by the Explorer II balloon mission in 1935. The first satellite (orbital) photographs of Earth were made on August 14, 1959, by the U.S. Explorer 6. The first satellite photographs of the Moon might have been made on October 6, 1959, by the Soviet satellite Luna 3, on a mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. The Blue Marble photograph was taken from space in 1972, and has become very popular in the media and among the public. Also in 1972 the United States started the Landsat program, the largest program for acquisition of imagery of Earth from space. In 1977, the first real time satellite imagery was acquired by the United States&#x27; KH-11 satellite system. The most recent Landsat satellite, Landsat 9, was launched on 27 September 2021.
All satellite images produced by NASA are published by NASA Earth Observatory and are freely available to the public. Several other countries have satellite imaging programs, and a collaborative European effort launched the ERS and Envisat satellites carrying various sensors. There are also private companies that provide commercial satellite imagery. In the early 21st century satellite imagery became widely available when affordable, easy to use software with access to satellite imagery databases was offered by several companies and organizations.

== Satellite image applications ==
Satellite images have numerous applications in a variety of fields.
* Weather: They guide meteorologists in forecasting patterns, tracking storms, and understanding climate change.
* Oceanography: By measuring sea temperatures and monitoring ecosystems, satellite images unlock insights into our oceans&#x27; health and global climate.
* Agriculture and fishing: Satellite data helps locate fish populations, assess crop health, and optimize resource use for a thriving agricultural and fishing industry.
* Biodiversity: Conservation efforts leverage satellite technology to map habitats, monitor ecosystem changes, and protect endangered species.
* Forestry: Satellite data empowers sustainable forestry by tracking deforestation, assessing fire risks, and managing resources effectively.
* Landscape: Analyzing land use patterns with satellite images supports urban planning and facilitates sustainable development initiatives.
Less mainstream uses include anomaly hunting, a criticized investigation technique involving the search of satellite images for unexplained phenomena.

The spectrum of satellite images is diverse, including visible light, near-infrared light, infrared light and radar, and many others. This wide range of light frequencies can provide researchers with large volumes of useful and rich information. In addition to the satellite applications mentioned above, these data can serve as powerful educational tools, advance scientific research and promote a deeper understanding of our environment. This shows that satellite imagery provides rich information and can promote global development.

== Data characteristics ==

There are five types of resolution when discussing satellite imagery in remote sensing: spatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric and geometric. Campbell (2002) defines these as follows:
* Spatial resolution is defined as the pixel size of an image representing the size of the surface area (i.e. m2) being measured on the ground, determined by the sensors&#x27; instantaneous field of view (IFOV).
* Spectral resolution is defined by the wavelength interval size (i.e. the size of discrete segments of the electromagnetic spectrum) and the number of intervals that the sensor is measuring.
* Temporal resolution is defined by the amount of time (e.g. days) that passes between imagery collection periods for a given surface location.
*Radiometric resolution is defined as the ability of an imaging system to record many levels of brightness (e.g. contrast) and to the effective bit-depth of the sensor (number of grayscale levels) and is typically expressed as 8-bit (0–255), 11-bit (0–2047), 12-bit (0–4095) or 16-bit (0–65,535).
* Geometric resolution refers to the satellite sensor&#x27;s ability to effectively image a portion of the Earth&#x27;s surface in a single pixel and is typically expressed in terms of ground sample distance (GSD). GSD is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can &quot;see&quot; an object on the ground within a single pixel. For example, the GSD of Landsat is ≈30m, which means the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel within an image is ≈30m x 30m. The latest commercial satellite (GeoEye 1) has a GSD of 0.41 m. This compares to a 0.3 m resolution obtained by some early military film based reconnaissance satellites such as Corona.

The resolution of satellite images varies depending on the instrument used and the altitude of the satellite&#x27;s orbit. For example, the Landsat archive offers repeated imagery at 30 meter resolution for the planet, but most of it has not been processed from the raw data. Landsat 7 has an average return period of 16 days. For many smaller areas, images with resolution as fine as 41 cm can be available.

Satellite imagery is sometimes supplemented with aerial photography, which has higher resolution, but is more expensive per square meter. Satellite imagery can be combined with vector or raster data in a GIS provided that the imagery has been spatially rectified so that it will properly align with other data sets.

==Imaging satellites==
=== Public domain ===
Satellite imaging of the Earth surface is of sufficient public utility that many countries maintain satellite imaging programs. The United States has led the way in making these data freely available for scientific use. Some of the more popular programs are listed below, recently followed by the European Union&#x27;s Sentinel constellation.

==== CORONA ====
The &quot;CORONA&quot; program was a series of American strategic reconnaissance satellites produced and operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Directorate of Science &amp; Technology with substantial assistance from the U.S. Air Force. The type of imagery is wet film panoramic and it used two cameras (AFT&amp;FWD) for capturing stereographic imagery.

==== Landsat ====
&quot;Landsat&quot; is the oldest continuous Earth-observing satellite imaging program. Optical Landsat imagery has been collected at 30 m resolution since the early 1980s. Beginning with Landsat 5, thermal infrared imagery was also collected (at coarser spatial resolution than the optical data). The Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Landsat 9 satellites are currently in orbit.

==== MODIS ====
&quot;MODIS&quot; has collected near-daily satellite imagery of the earth in 36 spectral bands since 2000. MODIS is on board the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites.

==== Sentinel ====
The ESA is currently developing the &quot;Sentinel&quot; constellation of satellites. Currently, 7 missions are planned, each for a different application. Sentinel-1 (SAR imaging), Sentinel-2 (decameter optical imaging for land surfaces), and Sentinel-3 (hectometer optical and thermal imaging for land and water) have already been launched.

====ASTER====
The &quot;ASTER&quot; is an imaging instrument onboard Terra, the flagship satellite of NASA&#x27;s Earth Observing System (EOS) launched in December 1999. ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems). ASTER data is used to create detailed maps of land surface temperature, reflectance, and elevation. The coordinated system of EOS satellites, including Terra, is a major component of NASA&#x27;s Science Mission Directorate and the Earth Science Division. The goal of NASA Earth Science is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth as an integrated system, its response to change, and to better predict variability and trends in climate, weather, and natural hazards.

* Land surface climatology—investigation of land surface parameters, surface temperature, etc., to understand land-surface interaction and energy and moisture fluxes
* Vegetation and ecosystem dynamics—investigations of vegetation and soil distribution and their changes to estimate biological productivity, understand land-atmosphere interactions, and detect ecosystem change
* Volcano monitoring—monitoring of eruptions and precursor events, such as gas emissions, eruption plumes, development of lava lakes, eruptive history and eruptive potential
* Hazard monitoring—observation of the extent and effects of wildfires, flooding, coastal erosion, earthquake damage, and tsunami damage
* Hydrology—understanding global energy and hydrologic processes and their relationship to global change; included is evapotranspiration from plants
* Geology and soils—the detailed composition and geomorphologic mapping of surface soils and bedrocks to study land surface processes and Earth&#x27;s history
* Land surface and land cover change—monitoring desertification, deforestation, and urbanization; providing data for conservation managers to monitor protected areas, national parks, and wilderness areas

==== Meteosat ====

The &quot;Meteosat&quot;-2 geostationary weather satellite began operationally to supply imagery data on 16 August 1981. Eumetsat has operated the Meteosats since 1987.

*The &quot;Meteosat visible and infrared imager (MVIRI)&quot;, three-channel imager: visible, infrared and water vapour; It operates on the first generation Meteosat, Meteosat-7 being still active.
*The 12-channel &quot;Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI)&quot; includes similar channels to those used by MVIRI, providing continuity in climate data over three decades; Meteosat Second Generation (MSG).
*The &quot;Flexible Combined Imager (FCI)&quot; on Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) will also include similar channels, meaning that all three generations will have provided over 60 years of climate data.

==== Himawari ====
The Himawari satellite series represents a significant leap forward in meteorological observation and environmental monitoring. With their advanced imaging technology and frequent data updates, Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 have become indispensable tools for weather forecasting, disaster management, and climate research, benefiting not only Japan but the entire Asia-Pacific region.

*Frequent Updates:These satellites can provide full-disk images of the Asia-Pacific region every 10 minutes, and even more frequently( every 2.5 minutes) for specific areas (Japan), ensuring that meteorologists have up-to-date information for accurate weather forecasting.
*Spectral Bands:
**Visible Light Bands (0.47 μm, 0.51 μm, 0.64 μm): These bands are used for daytime cloud, land, and ocean surface observations. They provide high-resolution images that are critical for tracking cloud movements and assessing weather conditions.
**Near-Infrared Bands (0.86 μm, 1.6 μm, 2.3 μm, 6.9 μm, 7.3 μm, 8.6 μm, 9.6 μm, 11.2 μm, 13.3 μm): These bands help in distinguishing between different types of clouds, vegetation, and surface features. They are particularly useful for detecting fog, ice, and snow.
**Infrared Bands (3.9 μm, 6.2 μm, 10.4 μm, 12.4 μm): The remaining bands cover the thermal infrared spectrum. These bands are crucial for measuring cloud-top temperatures, sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric water vapor content. They enable continuous monitoring of weather patterns.
*Advanced Imaging Technology: Himawari-8 and Himawari-9 are equipped with the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), which provides high-resolution images of the Earth. The AHI can capture images in 16 different spectral bands, allowing for detailed observation of weather patterns, clouds, and environmental phenomena.

=== Private domain ===
Several satellites are built and maintained by private companies, as follows.

====GeoEye====

GeoEye&#x27;s GeoEye-1 satellite was launched on September 6, 2008. The GeoEye-1 satellite has high resolution imaging system and is able to collect images with a ground resolution of 0.41 meters (16 inches) in panchromatic or black and white mode. It collects multispectral or color imagery at 1.65-meter resolution or about 64 inches.
====Maxar====

Maxar&#x27;s WorldView-2 satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 0.46 m spatial resolution (panchromatic only). The 0.46 meters resolution of WorldView-2&#x27;s panchromatic images allows the satellite to distinguish between objects on the ground that are at least 46 cm apart. Similarly Maxar&#x27;s QuickBird satellite provides 0.6 meter resolution (at nadir) panchromatic images.

Maxar&#x27;s WorldView-3 satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 0.31 m spatial resolution. WVIII also carries a short wave infrared sensor and an atmospheric sensor.

====Airbus Intelligence====
&quot;Pléiades&quot; constellation is composed of two very-high-resolution (50 centimeters pan &amp; 2.1 meter spectral) optical Earth-imaging satellites. &quot;Pléiades-HR 1A&quot; and &quot;Pléiades-HR 1B&quot; provide the coverage of Earth&#x27;s surface with a repeat cycle of 26 days. Designed as a dual civil/military system, Pléiades will meet the space imagery requirements of European defense as well as civil and commercial needs.
 is the advanced optical constellation, with four identical 30-cm resolution satellites with fast reactivity.

====Spot Image====
The 3 SPOT satellites in orbit (Spot 5, 6, 7) provide very high resolution images – 1.5 m for Panchromatic channel, 6m for Multi-spectral (R,G,B,NIR). Spot Image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites, in particular from Formosat-2 (Taiwan) and Kompsat-2 (South Korea) and from radar satellites (TerraSar-X, ERS, Envisat, Radarsat). Spot Image is also the exclusive distributor of data from the high resolution Pleiades satellites with a resolution of 0.50 meter or about 20 inches. The launches occurred in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The company also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing, as well as added value options.

====Planet Labs====
Planet Labs operates three satellite imagery constellations, RapidEye, Dove and SkySat.

In 2015, Planet acquired BlackBridge, and its constellation of five RapidEye satellites, launched in August 2008. The RapidEye constellation contains identical multispectral sensors which are equally calibrated. Therefore, an image from one satellite will be equivalent to an image from any of the other four, allowing for a large amount of imagery to be collected (4 million km2 per day), and daily revisit to an area. Each travel on the same orbital plane at 630 km, and deliver images in 5 meter pixel size. RapidEye satellite imagery is especially suited for agricultural, environmental, cartographic and disaster management applications. The company not only offers their imagery, but consults their customers to create services and solutions based on analysis of this imagery. The RapidEye constellation was retired by Planet in April 2020.

Planet&#x27;s Dove satellites are CubeSats that weigh , in length, width and height, orbit at a height of about and provide imagery with a resolution of and are used for environmental, humanitarian, and business applications.

SkySat is a constellation of sub-metre resolution Earth observation satellites that provide imagery, high-definition video and analytics services. Planet acquired the satellites with their purchase of Terra Bella (formerly Skybox Imaging), a Mountain View, California-based company founded in 2009 by Dan Berkenstock, Julian Mann, John Fenwick, and Ching-Yu Hu, from Google in 2017.

The SkySat satellites are based on using inexpensive automotive grade electronics and fast commercially available processors, but scaled up to approximately the size of a minifridge. The satellites are approximately long, compared to approximately for a 3U CubeSat, and weigh .

====ImageSat International====
Earth Resource Observation Satellites, better known as &quot;EROS&quot; satellites, are lightweight, low earth orbiting, high-resolution satellites designed for fast maneuvering between imaging targets. In the commercial high-resolution satellite market, EROS is the smallest very high resolution satellite; it is very agile and thus enables very high performances. The satellites are deployed in a circular Sun-synchronous near polar orbit at an altitude of 510 km (± 40 km).
EROS satellites imagery applications are primarily for intelligence, homeland security and national development purposes but also employed in a wide range of civilian applications, including: mapping, border control, infrastructure planning, agricultural monitoring, environmental monitoring, disaster response, training and simulations, etc.

EROS A – a high resolution satellite with 1.9–1.2m resolution panchromatic was launched on December 5, 2000.

EROS B – the second generation of Very High Resolution satellites with 70 cm resolution panchromatic, was launched on April 25, 2006.

EROS C2 – the third generation of Very High Resolution satellites with 30 cm. resolution panchromatic, was launched in 2021.

EROS C3 – the third generation of Very High Resolution satellites with 30 cm. resolution panchromatic and multispectral, was launched in 2023.

==== China Siwei ====
GaoJing-1 / SuperView-1 (01, 02, 03, 04) is a commercial constellation of Chinese remote sensing satellites controlled by China Siwei Surveying and Mapping Technology Co. Ltd. The four satellites operate from an altitude of 530 km and are phased 90° from each other on the same orbit, providing 0.5m panchromatic resolution and 2m multispectral resolution on a swath of 12 km.

==Disadvantages==

Because the total area of the land on Earth is so large and because resolution is relatively high, satellite databases are huge and image processing (creating useful images from the raw data) is time-consuming. Preprocessing, such as image destriping, is often required. Depending on the sensor used, weather conditions can affect image quality. For example, it is difficult to obtain images for areas of frequent cloud cover such as mountaintops. For such reasons, publicly available satellite image datasets are typically processed for visual or scientific commercial use by third parties.

Commercial satellite companies do not place their imagery into the public domain and do not sell their imagery; instead, one must acquire a license to use their imagery. Thus, the ability to legally make derivative works from commercial satellite imagery is diminished.

Privacy concerns have been brought up by some who wish not to have their property shown from above. Google Maps responds to such concerns in their FAQ with the following statement: &quot;We understand your privacy concerns... The images that Google Maps displays are no different from what can be seen by anyone who flies over or drives by a specific geographic location.&quot;

<doc id="1184562" wikidata="Q7872154" url="?curid=1184562" title="USS Nautilus (1799)">
<text>Nautilus was a schooner launched in 1799. The United States Navy purchased her in May 1803 and commissioned her USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;; she thus became the first ship to bear that name. She served in the First Barbary War. She was altered to a brigantine. The British captured &quot;Nautilus&quot; early in the War of 1812 and renamed her HMS &quot;Emulous&quot;. After her service with the Royal Navy, the Admiralty sold her in 1817.

==Origins==
Henry Spencer built &quot;Nautilus&quot; on 1799 as a merchant vessel on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The Navy purchased her at Baltimore, Maryland, from Thomas Tennant. She was commissioned on 24 June 1803, under Lieutenant Richard Somers.

==First Barbary War==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; sailed to Hampton Roads, whence she got underway on 30 June for the Mediterranean, carrying dispatches for the U.S. Mediterranean Squadron stationed there assigned to protect the interests of the United States and its citizens residing or trading in that area, and threatened at that time by the Barbary States.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 27 July and departed again on the 31st to deliver dispatches to Captain John Rodgers in , then returned to Gibraltar to await the arrival of Commodore Edward Preble, in , and join his squadron. &quot;Constitution&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 12 September, and after provisioning, the squadron, less , sailed 6 October with vessels of Capt. Rodgers&#x27;s squadron to Tangier. This display of naval strength induced the Emperor of Morocco to renew the treaty of 1786.

On 31 October 1803, the Tripolitans captured &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and the squadron&#x27;s interests came to focus on Tripoli and Tunis. Using Syracuse as their rendezvous point, the vessels appeared off Tunis and Tripoli at different times between November 1803 and May 1804. In February 1804, while Lieutenant Stephen Decatur daringly sailed into Tripoli harbor and burned the captured &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Nautilus&quot; cruised off Tunis. On 16 February she captured Maltese brigantine Mominato Crucifisso (or St. Crucifiso) 4-5 leagues off Tripoli. The vessel has a pass allowing her to travel to Tripoli in ballast to receive bullocks, and only bullocks, purchased for use of the British garrison at Malta. When stopped inbound she had cargo onboard in violation of the pass. Court later ordered her to be released.

Toward the end of the month &quot;Nautilus&quot; retired to Syracuse, returning to Tripoli in mid-March. On 20 March she collided with , causing damage to Nautilas that she had to return to port. Sometime after being repaired and before 16 April, 1804 she shipped water in a gale off Tripoli causing serious damage And necessitating throwing 4 guns overboard to save the ship. During May and June she repaired at Messina. June 30, 1804 she is reported to be almost wholly rebuilt at a cost upwards of $3,000. On May 28 Lt. Sommers was ordered to take command of six gunboats borrowed from the King of Naples &amp; most of her crew manned the gunboats. She was left in charge of Lt. Reid and a small crew and Marines. Departing 5 July, she joined &quot;Constitution&quot; off Tripoli on 25 July. During August and early September, she took part in the siege of Tripoli and saw action in five general attacks between 3 August and 3 September. On 16 September, 1804 Master Commander Dent took command. For the next five months, she continued to cruise off Tripoli and Tunis, retiring periodically to Syracuse and Malta, whence in February 1805, she sailed to Livorno to acquire a new mainmast.

On 27 April 1805, she arrived off Derna to participate in the attack, capture, and occupation of that town. She remained until 17 May, during which time she provided cover for the forces of Hamet Caramanli, former Bashaw of Tripoli, as they went into action against the army of Hamet&#x27;s brother Yusuf ibn Ali Karamanli, who had overthrown Hamet and assumed his title. Departing on the 17th, &quot;Nautilus&quot; retired to Malta with dispatches and casualties. At the end of the month, she returned to Tripoli and on 10 June hostilities ceased with the signing of a peace treaty.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; remained in the Mediterranean for a year after the treaty went into effect, conducting operations from Malta and Gibraltar. In the spring of 1806 she was assigned to Algiers for dispatch duty, sailing in June for the United States.

==Between wars==
Arriving at Washington, D.C., in mid-July, &quot;Nautilus&quot; entered the Washington Navy Yard there and was placed in ordinary. Reactivated in 1808, she was employed on the East Coast until entering the Navy Yard again in 1810. The Navy then altered her to a brig, giving her a battery of twelve 18-pounder (8 kg) carronades. The Navy recommissioned &quot;Nautilus&quot; in 1811 and she joined Stephen Decatur&#x27;s squadron.

==Capture==
After the War of 1812 with Britain broke out on 18 June 1812, &quot;Nautilus&quot; gained the dubious distinction of being the first vessel lost on either side. A squadron built around the Third Rate (64 guns) and the two Fifth Rate frigates, (38 guns) and (32 guns), captured her off northern New Jersey. &quot;Nautilus&quot; was 24 hours out on a cruise from New York when &quot;Shannon&quot; and &quot;Aeolus&quot; captured her on 17 July. At the time of her capture she mounted 16 guns, had crew of 106 men and was under the command of Lieutenant William M. Crane.

==HMS &quot;Emulous&quot;==
The British immediately but informally took &quot;Nautilus&quot; into service under the name &quot;Emulous&quot;, having just lost the on 2 August. On 29 August the Admiralty formally purchased &quot;Nautilus&quot;/&quot;Emulous&quot; for £3,252 17s 2d. On 2 February 1813 &quot;Emulous&quot; was commissioned under Commander William Mackenzie Godfrey, on the Halifax station.

&quot;Emulous&quot; proceeded to capture a number of American privateers or merchant vessels listed below:

* On 25 August 1812, &quot;Emulous&quot; captured the American ship &quot;Gossamer&quot;. That same day, &quot;Emulous&quot; captured the American privateer schooner &quot;Science&quot;, under the command of Captain W. Fernald. &quot;Science&quot;, of 74 tons, five guns, and 52 men was on a cruise out of Portsmouth.
* On 17 September 1812, &quot;Emulous&quot; was among the vessels sharing in &quot;Spartan&quot;″s capture of the &quot;Melantho&quot; on 17 September. &quot;Melantho&quot; of 402 tons, William Davidson, master, had been sailing from Chile to Boston with a cargo of 229 tons of copper, nine bales of furs, and $48,000. 
* On 21 September 1812, and captured the brig &quot;Ambition&quot;, sailing from Baltimore to Boston on 21 September 1812. &quot;Emulous&quot; and shared in the prize money. &quot;Ambition&quot;, Benjamin Shaw, of 139 tons (bm), master, had been carrying 804 barrels of flour.
* On 5 April 1813, she captured the American schooner privateer &quot;Cossack&quot;. &quot;Cossack&quot;, of Salem, 48 tons (bm), was pierced for 10 guns but carried only one long 18-pounder and had a crew of 40 men. &quot;Cossack&quot; arrived at Saint John, New Brunswick on 8 April. &quot;Cossac&quot;, a schooner, had been under the command of Jonathon Upton.
On 18 April &quot;Emulous&quot; captured the American ship &quot;Bird&quot;. &quot;Bird&quot;, J.Hammond, master, was a schooner of 80 tons (bm), and carrying a cargo of 3,700 &quot;hhd&quot; of staves and 20,000 shingles. She had been sailing from Frenchman&#x27;s Bay to the Spanish Main when &quot;Emulous&quot; captured her; &quot;Emulous&quot; took her into New Brunswick.
* On 5 May, &quot;Emulous&quot;, &quot;Shannon&quot;, , and captured the schooner &quot;Ann&quot;, of 142 tons, sailing from New Orleans to Bordeaux. &quot;Ann&quot;, J.B.Allison, master, was carrying a cargo of cotton, lead, and skins. That same day &quot;Nymphe&quot;, together with the same three other British ships, captured the American privateer &quot;Montgomery&quot;, of 12 guns and a crew of 75 (or 90) men. She was on her way home after a two-month cruise off the coast of Ireland. &quot;Montgomery&quot;, of Salem, was under the command of J.Strout. 
* On 4 August 1813, &quot;Emulous&quot; recaptured the schooner &quot;Four Brothers&quot;, of 330 tons (bm), R. Sinclair, master.
* On 21 or 24 September 1813, the Canadian privateer &quot;Dart&quot; drove the American privateer &quot;Orange&quot;, a chebacco boat of two guns and 11 men, on to Fox Island in Machias Bay on the coast of Maine. There the boats of &quot;Emulous&quot; and , under the command of Lieutenant Wright of &quot;Emulous&quot;, destroyed her.
* On 10 October 1813, &quot;Emulous&quot; destroyed two small American privateers in Passamaquaddy Bay, between Maine and New Brunswick. One was the schooner &quot;Orion&quot;, of one gun and 16 men; the other was the row boat &quot;Camelion&quot;, with 17 men and small arms.

==Post-war and fate==
On 22 July 1814, Godfrey removed to . Commander John Gore then took command on 23 July 1814 and remained until 3 February 1815. On 13 June 1815 Lieutenant John Undrell was promoted to the rank of Commander. He took command of &quot;Emulous&quot;, still on the Jamaica station. His replacement was the newly promoted Commander Thomas Wrenn Carter, who removed to in April 1816. Her last commander was Lieutenant Caleb Jackson (acting). He sailed &quot;Emulous&quot; to Deptford and paid her off there on 19 June 1816; she was then laid up there. The Admiralty sold her for £900 in August 1817.

&quot;Emulous&quot; may have become the mercantile &quot;Nautilus&quot;, a snow of 230 tons (bm), and built in America. &quot;Nautilus&quot;, D.Coff, master, Tofl, owner, and trade Cowes-St Thomas.

<text>USS &quot;Lamprey&quot; (SS-372), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the lamprey, any of certain eel-like aquatic vertebrates.

== USS &quot;Lamprey&quot; (SS-372) ==

&quot;Lamprey&quot; (SS-372) was laid down 22 February 1944 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company, Manitowoc, Wisconsin; launched 18 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. W. T. Nelson; and commissioned 17 November 1944.

After trials, tests, and training in Lake Michigan, the new submarine entered a floating drydock on 7 December at Lockport, Illinois; was floated down the Mississippi River; and arrived at New Orleans on 13 December. Four days later she departed New Orleans for the Pacific.

&quot;Lamprey&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor 17 February 1945 for the coast of Luzon and her first war patrol. She steamed on life guard duty off Formosa and Hong Kong until 29 March; transited the Singapore Straits 8 April; and the next day steamed through the Karimata Straits into the Java Sea. She sighted no worthwhile targets, however, because most of Japan&#x27;s merchant marine and naval fleet had been destroyed. The submarine headed for a refit at Fremantle, Australia, arriving 22 April 1945.

Under a new commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. Lucien B. McDonald, &quot;Lamprey&quot; cleared Fremantle 21 May and entered the Java Sea bound for her patrol area in the Siam Gulf. On 28 May &quot;Lamprey&quot; and closed for a coordinated gun attack which damaged and set afire a 600-ton escort ship. &quot;Lamprey&quot; set course for Subic Bay where she arrived 29 June.

The submarine returned to sea 26 July for her third war patrol and spent most of her time searching for targets along the Gulf of Siam. She entered the Singapore area 8 August to patrol west of Pengiboe Island where she sank a small craft with gunfire. She was relieved on station by British submarine the same day and headed for Borneo. On 12 August her guns destroyed a cargo-carrying lugger from Surabaya. The submarine was closing in on a two-masted schooner 15 August when she received word to cease hostilities.

&quot;Lamprey&quot; departed Subic Bay 31 August and moored in San Francisco, 22 September. She entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard, decommissioned 3 June 1946, and was laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Lamprey&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

== ARA &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; (S-12) ==

On 21 July 1960 she was transferred on loan to the Government of Argentina and was commissioned in the Argentine Navy as ARA &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; (S-12). Along with ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (former ), she was used mainly for training. The conning towers of both submarines were later locally upgraded to improve hydrodynamics. Some years ago, Argentinian officials disclosed that a group of tactical divers had carried out an incursion on the Falkland Islands on board the &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; in October 1966.

The submarine was returned to US Navy custody, 1 September 1971, to be struck from the Naval Vessel Register and sold outright to the Argentine Navy, which therefore employed them only for training purposes. Both submarines were broken up in 1974 for use as spare parts.

<doc id="1184572" wikidata="Q1702253" url="?curid=1184572" title="1990 Romanian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Romania on 20 May 1990 to elect the President and members of Parliament. They were the first elections held after the overthrow of the communist regime six months earlier and the first free elections held in the country since 1937. It was also the first time the president had been directly elected, the position having been previously elected by the legislature since it was introduced in 1974.

The National Salvation Front (FSN), which had headed the interim government that took power after the overthrow of Nicolae Ceaușescu, won a decisive victory. Opposition parties performed well below expectations; none of them had the time or resources to present themselves as alternatives to the FSN. Interim President and FSN leader Ion Iliescu was elected for a full term with 85 percent of the vote. The 1990 Romanian presidential election was the first of its kind held in post-1989 Romania. The FSN also won large majorities in both houses of Parliament, with 263 of the 395 seats in the Assembly of Deputies and 91 of the 118 seats in the Senate.

The United States State Department expressed concerns about organised violence and polling irregularities, but concluded that they had had no effect on the outcome and pronounced the elections free and fair.

To date, this is the only time since direct presidential elections were introduced that a president has been elected without the need for a runoff. Iliescu&#x27;s 85 percent vote share also remains the highest for a direct presidential election.

<doc id="1184578" wikidata="Q1779684" url="?curid=1184578" title="Yokogawa Electric">
<text>is a Japanese multinational electrical engineering and software company, with businesses based on its measurement, control, and information technologies.

It has a global workforce of over 19,000 employees, 84 subsidiary and 3 affiliated companies operating in 55 countries. The company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 stock index.

Yokogawa pioneered the development of distributed control systems and introduced its Centum series DCS in 1975.

Some of Yokogawa&#x27;s most recognizable products are production control systems, test and measurement instruments, pressure transmitters, flow meters, oxygen analyzers, fieldbus instruments, manufacturing execution systems and advanced process control.

==History==
Yokogawa traces its roots back to 1915, when Dr. Tamisuke Yokogawa, a renowned architect, established an electric meter research institute in Shibuya, Tokyo. After pioneering the development and production of electric meters in Japan, this enterprise was incorporated in 1920 as Yokogawa Electric Works Ltd.

In 1933 Yokogawa began the research and manufacture of aircraft instruments and flow, temperature, and pressure controllers. In the years following the war, Yokogawa went public, developed its first electronic recorders, signed a technical assistance agreement for industrial instruments with the U.S. firm Foxboro, and opened its first overseas sales office (New York).

In the 1960s the company made a full-scale entry into the industrial analyzer market and launched the development, manufacturing, and sales of vortex flowmeters, and in the decade following established its first manufacturing plant outside Japan (Singapore), opened a sales office in Europe, and became one of the first companies to bring a distributed process control system to market. In 1983 Yokogawa merged with Hokushin Electric Works and, towards the end of the decade, entered the high-frequency measuring instrument business. In the 1990s, Yokogawa established an office in Bahrain to oversee its business in the Middle East and entered the confocal scanner and biotechnology businesses.

In 2002 the firm continued its growth with the acquisition of Ando Electric, and in 2005 set the stage for a new level of globalization in its industrial automation business with the establishment of Yokogawa Electric International in Singapore. In 2008 the company entered the drug discovery support market with a new bio test system.

In April 2020, Yokogawa acquired Scarborough-based Fluid Imaging Technologies. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

In 2021, Yokogawa focused on cloud-based solutions and industrial IoT applications. The company launched the OpreX Control Care cloud service and acquired Industrial Control Systems, Inc. (ICSI) to strengthen its industrial cybersecurity offerings.

He then attended Penn State University for a year prior to transferring to Temple University, where he majored in English. McKay dropped out of Temple a semester-and-a-half before he was set to earn his bachelor&#x27;s degree. He described it as &quot;settling with an imaginary degree&quot;.

==Career==
McKay studied under Del Close at The Second City and then joined The Second City Touring Company. He performed in one revue as a member of the Second City e.t.c. company and filled in on the Mainstage in the 79th Review before moving fully to the Mainstage for Second City’s 80th revue, Piñata Full of Bees. The landmark show also featured Jon Glaser, Rachel Dratch, and Scott Adsit.

McKay is one of the founding members of the Upright Citizens Brigade improv comedy group and a former performer at Chicago&#x27;s ImprovOlympic, where he was a member of the improv group, The Family, whose members included Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Neil Flynn, Miles Stroth, and Ali Farahnakian, as well as Child&#x27;s Play Touring Theatre.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===

McKay originally auditioned for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to be an onscreen performer, but did not make the cut. However, the scripts he submitted earned him a job as a writer in 1995. Within a year, McKay became head writer at age 27, a position he held until 2001. He also directed a number of short films for the show, including the original &quot;SNL&quot; Digital Shorts. McKay encouraged his Second City friend Tina Fey to submit some of her scripts to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and she later succeeded him as head writer. Though McKay was never an actual &quot;SNL&quot; cast member, he did make several on-camera appearances over the years and had a recurring role as an obnoxious audience member &quot;Keith&quot; who would often shout insults at the celebrity hosts during their opening monologue.

Shortly after leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, McKay teamed up with comedian Will Ferrell to form production company Gary Sanchez Productions and write the comedy films &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010), all of which he also directed, produced and made cameo appearances in as an actor. Ferrell and McKay co-produced the HBO series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;.

McKay was one of the writers for the film &quot;The Campaign&quot; (2012), and produced the film &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; (2015), the latter of which reunited &quot;The Other Guys&quot; stars Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, and was directed by Sean Anders. McKay also rewrote the script for the Marvel Studios feature film &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, directed by Peyton Reed; McKay had initially been in talks to direct the film following Edgar Wright&#x27;s departure, but opted not to out of respect for Wright. McKay also worked with Reed, Paul Rudd, Gabriel Ferrari &amp; Andrew Barrer on &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; to flesh out the story. He has also expressed interest in helming a Silver Surfer movie for Marvel Studios.

==Films and television==
He produced the films &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; (2009), &quot;The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard&quot; (2009), &quot;The Virginity Hit&quot; (2010), &quot;Casa de Mi Padre&quot; (2012), &quot;Bachelorette&quot; (2012), &quot;Tim and Eric&#x27;s Billion Dollar Movie&quot; (2012), &quot;The Campaign&quot; (2012), &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters&quot; (2013), &quot;Tammy&quot; (2014), &quot;Welcome to Me&quot; (2014), &quot;Get Hard&quot; (2015), &quot;Sleeping with Other People&quot; (2015), &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Boss&quot; (2016).

In addition to &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, McKay has produced the television series &quot;Big Lake&quot; and &quot;Succession&quot;, whose pilot he directed, and the miniseries &quot;The Spoils of Babylon&quot;, and &quot;The Chris Gethard Show&quot;.

In April 2019, McKay and Ferrell announced that they were separating as producing partners but would continue producing all projects currently in development or in production at Gary Sanchez Productions. It was later revealed the reason for the split was because McKay cast John C. Reilly as Jerry Buss on the show &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot;, a role that Ferrell had coveted, without informing him.

===Hyperobject Industries===
In 2019, McKay launched a new production company, Hyperobject Industries, which has a first look overall television deal with HBO and had a first-look feature deal at Paramount Pictures. Hyperobject Industries&#x27; first television project was an HBO pilot based on Jeff Pearlman&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s&quot;. McKay directed the pilot. More recently, McKay&#x27;s Hyperobject Industries has a first look deal with Apple.

===Directing===

McKay has directed, and co-written with Will Ferrell, the films &quot;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy&quot; (2004), &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (2008), &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010), and &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013). He has directed an &quot;alternate film&quot; about Ron Burgundy that is considered a companion to &quot;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy&quot; (2004) entitled &quot;Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie&quot; (2004), which is made up mostly of alternative takes, deleted scenes, and scrapped sub-plots from the original film strung together with a narrative.

McKay directed and co-wrote with Ferrell the George W. Bush Broadway show &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome America&quot;. He produced the horror-action film &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters&quot;.

McKay directed the TV movie documentary &quot;Lifecasters&quot; (2013). He has directed a number of short films, including digital shorts for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and the short video &quot;Good Cop, Baby Cop&quot; for Funny or Die that stars his daughter Pearl. Among the other short films he has directed include &quot;The Procedure&quot; (2007) starring Will Ferrell, Willem Dafoe, and Andy Richter, &quot;Green Team&quot; (2008) starring Ferrell, John C. Reilly, and himself, and the K-Swiss commercial, &quot;Kenny Powers: The K-Swiss MFCEO&quot; (2011), starring Danny McBride as Kenny Powers from &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, which he co-produces with Ferrell and has also directed an episode of.

He directed and wrote the film adaptation of the Michael Lewis non-fiction book &quot;The Big Short&quot;, about the financial and subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2008, and the build-up of the financial and credit bubble. The film opened in limited release on December 11, 2015, expanded to wide release on December 23, 2015; the film starred Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carell. He received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work in the film, winning his first Academy Award in the latter category. In 2016, he and co-writer Charles Randolph received the USC Scripter Award for their screenplay.

In 2016, he became attached to the superhero film &quot;Irredeemable&quot; based on the comic of the same name by Mark Waid.

In November 2016, McKay began development of the biographical black comedy &quot;Backseat&quot;, about former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and his rise to power, though the title was eventually changed to &quot;Vice&quot;. Starring Christian Bale as Cheney, the film was released in the United States on December 25, 2018, by Annapurna Pictures. Despite polarized reviews, &quot;Vice&quot; received eight nominations at the 91st Academy Awards, including the Best Picture and McKay&#x27;s second nomination for Best Director, and won for Best Make-Up and Hairstyling.

In 2020, McKay began working on the satirical black comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot;, about two low level scientists trying to convince the world that a catastrophic comet is coming. McKay wrote the script and produced the film for Netflix. Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Rob Morgan, Tyler Perry, Meryl Streep, and Cate Blanchett star in the film. It received a limited theatrical release in December 2021, before streaming on Netflix later in the month. The film received four nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

McKay was set to work with Jennifer Lawrence for the biographical film &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, about entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes, and based on the book &quot;Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup&quot;. Originally set to be produced by Legendary Pictures and released by Universal Pictures, in December 2021, the project was picked up by Apple Studios. In November 2022, however, Lawrence left the project due to not wanting to copy Amanda Seyfried&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Dropout&quot;. The current status of the project is unknown.

In March 2023, it was revealed that McKay&#x27;s next project would be titled &quot;Average Height, Average Build&quot;, a political satire focused on a serial killer. The film was set to star Robert Pattinson, Amy Adams, Robert Downey Jr., Forest Whitaker, and Danielle Deadwyler. On April 30, 2023, it was announced the project had been acquired by Netflix. On December 4, 2023, it was announced that McKay had left the project to pursue a film on climate change, and the project was subsequently scrapped.

=== Funny or Die ===

In 2007, McKay and Ferrell launched the user-submitted comedy video site Funny or Die. A video on the site, titled &quot;The Landlord&quot;, features both him and his young daughter, Pearl, whom Ferrell and his wife bait to say curse words. Pearl also starred in a second video titled &quot;Good Cop, Baby Cop&quot;.

===Podcasting===
From November 2015 until October 2016, McKay hosted the science/comedy podcast &quot;Surprisingly Awesome&quot; with Adam Davidson, produced by Gimlet Media. McKay additionally produced &quot;Broken: Jeffrey Epstein&quot; and &quot;Broken: Seeking Justice&quot;, a podcast series that explored the Jeffrey Epstein case. His next podcast project, &quot;Death at the Wing&quot;, investigated a series of deaths among high-profile young basketball players in the 1980s and 1990s. In February 2022, he appeared as a guest on &quot;Smartless&quot;, a comedic podcast hosted by Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. In 2023, he hosted &quot;Death on the Lot&quot; about celebrity deaths in Hollywood in the 1950s.

==Personal life==
In 1999, he married Shira Piven, a film and television director. They have two daughters. His brother-in-law is actor Jeremy Piven.

=== Political views ===
McKay supports gun control and abortion rights.

He has been critical of former President Bill Clinton. &quot;I legitimately think Bill Clinton is one of the worst presidents in the modern age&quot;. McKay criticized Clinton for deregulating banks and for his personal life in light of the MeToo movement.

McKay serves on the Creative Council of RepresentUs, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization. He was a supporter of the Democratic Party and endorsed Bernie Sanders for President of the United States in 2016 and again in 2020. He identifies as a democratic socialist and joined the Democratic Socialists of America in 2019.

McKay was criticized for going soft on Democrats for their role in the Iraq War in his film &quot;Vice,&quot; which he later said was a mistake. &quot;I regret not giving more blame to the Democrats, who went along with the war in Iraq...I made mistakes, read the reviews and went, &#x27;Yes, fair,&#x27;&quot; he told &quot;Variety&quot; in March 2022.

In October 2023, McKay signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to US president Joe Biden, calling for a ceasefire of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

On November 6, 2024, after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, McKay announced that he would be leaving the Democratic Party, writing on X: &quot;It is time to abandon the Dem Party. I&#x27;m registering Green Party or Working Families. But am open to ideas.&quot;

=== Activism ===
McKay is a prominent voice for climate action. In 2022, he donated $4 million to the Climate Emergency Fund and joined its board of directors. He has also donated to Just Stop Oil.

In 2023, McKay founded Yellow Dot Studios to raise awareness and mobilize action on the climate emergency. The non-profit company produces videos and campaigns to tackle the misinformation promoted by the oil industry.

He has spoken prominently about his experience with climate anxiety and the importance of comedy and humor as tools in addressing the climate crisis, while he has also spoken in support of disruptive climate activism.

=== Health ===
At age 26, McKay first noticed shaking in his hands while performing with Second City. Around 2000, he was diagnosed with essential tremor. The condition causes his body and voice to quiver. He conducts print interviews lying down and televised ones in a special high backed chair to accommodate his disability.

In 2018, McKay had a heart attack while filming &quot;Vice&quot;, starring Christian Bale, whose character Dick Cheney has multiple heart attacks in the film. McKay credits his awareness of the issue from researching the film with his quick response that got him to the hospital before he incurred any permanent damage. During an interview on the 347th episode of &quot;The Empire Film Podcast&quot;, McKay said: &quot;Either Christian Bale or Dick Cheney just saved my life.&quot;

<text>General elections were held in Romania on 28 November 2004, with a second round of the presidential elections on 12 December between former Prime Minister Adrian Năstase of the then ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) and then incumbent Bucharest Mayor Traian Băsescu of the opposition Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), more specifically of the Democratic Party (PD). Băsescu was elected President by a narrow majority of just 51.2%. The 2004 presidential election was the fifth of its kind held in post-1989 Romania.

Following 2003 amendments to the constitution which lengthened the presidential term to five years, these were the last joint elections to the presidency and Parliament in Romania&#x27;s political history thus far.

==Campaign==
===Parliamentary elections===
The main contenders were the left-wing alliance made up of the then incumbent Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSD) and the Romanian Humanist Party (PUR), and, on the other hand, the center-right Justice and Truth Alliance (DA; ) comprising the conservative-liberal National Liberal Party (PNL) and the initially social-democratic Democratic Party (PD) which later adopted a center-right Christian democratic ideology.

Other significant contenders were the Greater Romania Party (PRM) (right-wing nationalists), the ethnic Hungarian party Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), and the Union for Romanian Reconstruction (UPRR), a group of right-wing technocrats.

==Conduct==
The opposition alleged fraudulent use by the PSD of &quot;supplementary lists&quot;, designed to help Romanians in transit to vote. Traditionally, Romanians voted with a cardboard identity card, which was stamped when they voted. Most Romanians now have laminated plastic IDs, to which a printed stamp is affixed when a person votes. However, the stamps can be easily removed. In spite of this, electoral fraud is nearly impossible to commit, as every citizen is assigned to one local voting station, the only location he/she can vote at.

The opposition claimed that there were organized &quot;electoral excursions&quot; of PSD supporters who were bussed to various towns to vote several times. This was corroborated by several teams of journalists, who followed the buses.

The government attacked the opposition by arguing that &#x27;rumours of fraud&#x27; affect Romania&#x27;s economy and its external credibility.

In January 2005, the IMAS institute of statistics released an analysis of the voting results in the 16,824 precincts. In the top 1,000 precincts with the most votes on the supplementary lists, the PSD had 43% to the DA&#x27;s 23%, while in the precincts with fewest votes on supplementary lists, the PSD had 30% to the DA&#x27;s 34%. The same trend was true in the precincts with most void votes. Wayback Machine

==Presidential candidates==
&lt;section begin=&quot;candidates&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section end=&quot;candidates&quot; /&gt;

==Results==
===President===

Corneliu Vadim Tudor positioned himself against Băsescu, without openly endorsing Năstase. Marko Bela openly endorsed Adrian Năstase. Gheorghe Ciuhandu openly endorsed Băsescu.

Both Băsescu and Năstase came from left-wing parties (PD and PSD) that were members of Socialist International (SI). However, SI supported Năstase, which led to the abandonment of the social-democratic doctrine by the PD and the withdrawal of the party from SI in 2005.

===Parliament===
====Senate====
====Chamber of Deputies====
==Aftermath==
On 13 December, the PUR president Dan Voiculescu hinted that they have more in common with the DA (both have a center-right orientation) and that they might break from the PSD, but one day later said that he would remain with PSD. It has been suggested by the press that this could be result of a blackmail about his communist past. By 25 December both UDMR and PUR signed a protocol of alliance with DA (Justice and Truth), with the designated prime minister being Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu. Thus, the PSD was left in opposition while Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), and the Humanist Party (PUR, renamed Conservative Party in 2005) formed the government.

<text>The second USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; was a schooner launched in 1838 for the United States Coast Survey for hydrographic surveying of the coast of the United States. She was commissioned into the United States Navy in 1847 for service in the Mexican–American War, then returned to Coast Survey service from 1848 to 1859.

==Service history==
===U.S. Coast Survey, 1838–1847 ===
&quot;Nautilus&quot;, the first ship designed for the United States Coast Survey, was completed in 1838. Until the spring of 1844 she carried out surveys for the Coast Survey in the Gulf of Mexico and along the United States East Coast, operating under Mr. Ferdinand R. Hassler from 1838 to 1843 and Dr. A. D. Bache from 1843 to 1844. In April 1844, although still a Coast Survey ship, she was put under the command of Lieutenant G. M. Bache, USN, to undertake surveys for the U.S. Navy.

===Mexican–American War, 1847–1848===
Three years later, in 1847, &quot;Nautilus&quot; was taken over by the U.S. Navy for temporary duty during the Mexican–American War, as light-draft vessels were needed for operations off the United States Gulf Coast. Such vessels, with their ability to ride over the sandbars frequently found at the entrances to harbors on that coast and to patrol between those harbors close to shore, facilitated combined operations and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s ability to provide U.S. forces in Mexico under Major General Zachary Taylor with a secure line of communications in the Gulf of Mexico. The Navy returned &quot;Nautilus&quot; to the Coast Survey in July 1848. 

===U.S. Coast Survey, 1848–1859 ===
After &quot;Nautilus&quot;′s return to the Coast Survey, she performed hydrographic survey duties for that agency until 1859.

<doc id="1184616" wikidata="Q7349110" url="?curid=1184616" title="Robert R. Neall">
<text>Robert R. Neall (born June 26, 1948) is an American politician and Republican in Maryland who has served as state health secretary, state senator, state delegate and county executive of Anne Arundel County.

== Elected offices ==
Originally a Democrat, Neall switched parties in 1972 to become a Republican. Neall was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1975 to 1987, serving as the Minority Whip, 1978–83 and the Minority Leader, 1983–87. He was the Republican nominee for the United States Congress in the 4th District in 1986, losing to Tom McMillen in an extremely close election by 428 votes. He was elected County Executive of Anne Arundel County, Maryland from 1990 to 1994.

After his term ended, Neall was appointed by the Anne Arundel County Republican Central Committee to fill a vacancy as state senator from the 33rd District after the death of John A. Cade. Neall was a member of the Budget and Taxation Committee. Neall was also a member of the Thornton Commission, which developed a plan for distributing money to the state&#x27;s needier school districts in Baltimore City and Prince George&#x27;s County and, after legislative compromise, Montgomery County.

In 1999, although the 33rd legislative District is one of Maryland&#x27;s most conservative with 6,700 more registered Republicans than Democrats, Neall switched parties on ideological grounds and became a Democrat. In a letter to Richard D. Bennett, the state GOP chairman and later U.S. District Court Judge, Neall said, &quot;While I have from time to time felt uncomfortable and unwelcome in the Republican Party, (my) feelings have clearly worsened in recent years&quot; because of the changing nature of the party.

In 2002, Neall was soundly defeated for re-election by Republican Janet Greenip. Afterward, Neall said of his party switch, &quot;I have never ever regretted doing what I thought was right.&quot;

== Ehrlich advisor ==
In 2003, Baltimore City schools&#x27; chief executive, Bonnie S. Copeland requested that Neall help solve a severe budget deficit. To qualify for a $42 million loan from the state, Gov. Bob Ehrlich requested that Neall draft a plan for fiscal and management accountability. Neall&#x27;s financial rescue plan was rejected by the Baltimore City School Board, sending the system into crisis as it headed towards insolvency. Neall then created controversy with his abrupt resignation on the day that he delivered his report.

== Hogan advisor ==
Neall rejoined the Republican Party in 2014. In November 2014, then Governor-elect Larry Hogan appointed Neall to his transition team as a special advisor on fiscal policy. Neall was appointed to the University System of Maryland&#x27;s Board of Regents effective July 1, 2015. He replaced Tom McMillen who defeated Neall for Congress in 1986. In May 2016, Governor Hogan appointed Neall as a senior administration advisor to head an effort to reorganize state government to run more efficiently. On December 21, 2017, Governor Hogan appointed Neall as Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health effective January 9, 2018. In November 2020, he announced his retirement, effective December 1, saying, &quot;These last three years, though trying, have been very rewarding and I simply do not have the strength and vitality to continue. You have to know when to say when.&quot;

<text>Nautilus II was a motor pleasure boat built at City Island, New York in early 1917. She was enrolled in the Naval Coast Defense Reserve and commissioned into the United States Navy in October 1917 as the motor patrol boat USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SP-559), and assigned to patrol and escort duties of the New York City area for the remainder of World War I. She was decommissioned and returned to her owner, E.E. Dickinson of Essex County, Connecticut, on 14 February 1919.

The U.S. Navy considers the name &quot;Nautilus II&quot; to be separate from the &quot;Nautilus&quot; lineage.

<doc id="1184619" wikidata="Q409196" url="?curid=1184619" title="Methyl orange">
<text>Methyl orange is a pH indicator frequently used in titration because of its clear and distinct color variance at different pH values. Methyl orange shows red color in acidic medium and yellow color in basic medium. Because it changes color at the p&quot;K&quot;a of a mid strength acid, it is usually used in titration of strong acids in weak bases that reach the equivalence point at a pH of 3.1-4.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;A/B Indicators&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a universal indicator, methyl orange does not have a full spectrum of color change, but it has a sharp end point. In a solution becoming less acidic, methyl orange changes from red to orange and, finally, to yellow—with the reverse process occurring in a solution of increasing acidity.

== Indicator colors ==

In a solution that decreases in acidity, methyl orange moves from the color red to orange and finally to yellow with the opposite occurring for a solution increasing in acidity. This color change from yellow to red occurs because the protons in the acidic solution react with the N=N bond of the molecule, protonating one of them and changing the visible light absorption of the molecule to reflect more red light than orange/yellow. 
In an acid, it is reddish and in alkali, it is yellow. Methyl orange has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 3.47 in water at .

== Other indicators ==
Modified (or screened) methyl orange, an indicator consisting of a solution of methyl orange and xylene cyanol, changes from grey-violet to green as the solution becomes more basic.

==Safety==
Methyl orange has mutagenic properties. When methyl orange is put under oxidative stress, one of the double-bonded nitrogen atoms that connects the aromatic rings gets radicalized and can further break down into reactive oxygen species or anilines, which are carcinogenic and can mutate DNA. Various bacteria and enzymes can also cause this breakdown to occur.

==Synthesis==
Methyl orange is an azobenzene derivative that can be formed from dimethylaniline and sulfanilic acid, first through a diazonium salt formation with the sulfanilic acid, followed by a nucleophilic attack from the dimethylaniline and rearomatization.

==UV-vis spectrum==
The absorption of methyl orange on the UV-vis spectrum is between 350-550 nm, with its peak at 464 nm. This is in the green-purple visible light range and explains why methyl orange is, in fact, orange.

<doc id="1184622" wikidata="Q7072130" url="?curid=1184622" title="O. James Lighthizer">
<text>O. James &quot;Jim&quot; Lighthizer (born March 20, 1946) is an American lawyer, politician, and president emeritus of the American Battlefield Trust, a nonprofit battlefield preservation organization.

== Political career ==
As a Democrat, Lighthizer was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1979 to 1982.

Lighthizer served from 1982 to 1990 as elected County Executive of Anne Arundel County, Maryland and is remembered for being instrumental in the creation of Quiet Waters Park, something he would later say was &quot;the toughest political fight in my 16 years of politics&quot;.

After his term ended, Lighthizer served as the Secretary of Transportation to Governor William Donald Schaefer from 1991 to 1995. During his tenure, he developed new programs that matched state fund with federal ISTEA (Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) funds to preserve battlefield land. Between 1991 and 2014, the programs Lighthizer initiated and championed protected 8,700 acres on 61 properties near the Antietam National Battlefield, as well as additional acreage at other Maryland battlegrounds.

== Nonprofit career ==
After leaving state service, Lighthizer resumed the private practice of law. As a board member at the Civil War Trust, he helped engineer its merger with the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites in 1999 before becoming president of the merged organization. In 2011, the Civil War Preservation Trust was renamed, again becoming simply the Civil War Trust, and in May 2018, the overall organization was renamed American Battlefield Trust, with the Civil War Trust continuing as a division of the umbrella organization along with a second division, the Revolutionary War Trust.

In November 2019, at the 20th anniversary of his presidency, Lighthizer announced that he would retire in 2020. On November 12, 1999, Lighthizer was named president of the newly formed Civil War Preservation Trust, which was created from the merger of two Civil War battlefield preservation organizations, the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites, founded in 1987, and the Civil War Trust, founded in 1991. Together, these two organizations had preserved more than 6,000 acres of battlefield land, but had amassed more than $7 million in debt. In 2000, Lighthizer&#x27;s first full year, the Trust (now named the American Battlefield Trust) retired all of the outstanding debt while also saving 2,421 new acres. In November 2014, the Trust expanded its preservation mission to include not only Civil War battlefields, but those of the American Revolution and the War of 1812. Through 2019, the organization has saved almost 52,000 acres at more than 130 battlefields in 24 states, averaging well over 2,000 acres a year during Lighthizer&#x27;s 20 years at the helm. Membership grew from about 20,000 in 2000 to more than 47,000 in 2017. From 2000 through 2019, the Trust took in a total of $451 million for battlefield preservation, including $235 million in private donations and $216 million in federal and public funding. In 2019, the Trust received its 10th consecutive four-star rating from Charity Navigator, which evaluates non-profit organizations for fiscal stability, responsibility and performance. Only two percent of non-profits have attained a four-star rating from Charity Navigator for as many as nine consecutive years.

Lighthizer received the National Humanities Medal in a White House ceremony on January 13, 2021. &quot;I was very shocked to receive it,&quot; said Lighthizer. &quot;To be recognized by the president of the United States for your own work is extremely gratifying. It&#x27;s very humbling.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Lighthizer is married and the father of five children. Lighthizer&#x27;s brother, Robert Lighthizer, formerly served as U.S. Trade Representative.

<doc id="1184626" wikidata="Q382931" url="?curid=1184626" title="Bracer">
<text>A bracer (or arm-guard) is a strap or sheath, commonly made of leather, stone or plastic, that covers the ventral (inside) surface of an archer&#x27;s bow-holding arm. It protects the archer&#x27;s forearm against injury by accidental whipping from the bowstring or the fletching of the arrow while shooting, and also prevents the loose sleeve from catching the bowstring. They normally only cover part of the forearm, but full-length bracers extending to the upper arm are also available, and other areas have been covered by some archers. In addition, chest guards are sometimes worn, usually by female archers, to protect the breast. With some combinations of non-baggy clothing and bows with a larger distance between the bow and the string, the archer may not need to wear any bracer.

==Decorated bracers==
The modern Navajo people and Hopi developed a form of bracer known as a ketoh, which can be decorated with silver, turquoise, and other adornments, possibly from earlier examples made of bone. Ketohs usually have a central motif, sometimes with a stone ornament, and four curvilinear shapes that radiate toward the corners. Ketohs may have a smooth leather surface on the inside of the arm and are then functional, but they are normally used as items of personal and ritual adornment, or as works of art in their own right.

Stone wrist-guards from Beaker culture graves of the European Bronze Age have been thought to be archery bracers. However, they are usually found on the outside of the arm where they would have been more conspicuous. Many have only two holes which would make them difficult to fasten securely to the arm, and some have projecting rivets which would catch on the bow string and make them unsuitable for use as a bracer. Many show great skill in polishing and stone working, and few are found in areas from which their stone originates. When the objects occur in barrows, they always occur in the central primary grave, a place thought to be reserved for heads of family and other important people. They may have been status symbols of prowess in hunting or war, probably mounted as decorations on functional bracers. A few wrist-guards made of gold or amber have also been found; scholars believe these were for ornamental rather than functional use. A review identifies two major sources of stone from which they are made, suggests that they may well not be connected with archery, and highlights other potential uses.

==Other uses==
Bracers have also been used in other sports, including ball games such as Follis (played in ancient Rome).

In many common role-playing games, bracers are a general piece of armour rather than protective archery equipment, possibly due to confusion with vambraces.

<text>Robert A. Pascal (July 20, 1934 – March 12, 2021) was an American Republican politician, collegiate football player, professional Canadian football player and a propane entrepreneur who served as County Executive of Anne Arundel County, Maryland from 1975 to 1982.

==Early life==
Pascal was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. He was raised in Bloomfield, New Jersey, where his father worked in the local school district, and he attended Bloomfield High School. He played football at Duke University. During this time, Pascal earned first team All-American as a halfback in 1955. He led the Duke Blue Devils in rushing for two seasons, and was named team MVP in 1955. He was also a two time first team All-ACC selection. After graduating from Duke in 1956, Pascal was drafted in the third round by the Baltimore Colts. Pascal instead decided to play in the Canadian Football League for the Montreal Alouettes. During his one season in the league, he played for the Grey Cup.

==Career==

After playing in the Canadian Football League, Pascal then moved back to the United States and entered the propane business. He eventually bought his own company, United Propane, and built it into one of the top 25 in the country. Pascal sold the company to Inergy, L.P. in 2003. Pascal also entered politics.

Pascal was a State Senator from 1971 to 1974. From 1974 to 1982 he served as the Anne Arundel County Executive and was key to the creation of Kinder Farm Park, which he had the county buy from the Kinder family.

Pascal was the Republican nominee for Governor of Maryland in 1982, losing to incumbent Harry R. Hughes. Pascal served as the Secretary of Appointments to Governor William Donald Schaefer from 1989 to 1995.

== Legacy ==
The following have been named after Bob Pascal:
* Pascal Field House, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina
* Pascal Senior Center, Glen Burnie, Maryland — Anne Arundel County&#x27;s first senior center
* Pascal Center for the Performing Arts, Anne Arundel Community College, Arnold, Maryland
* Pascal Field, St. Mary&#x27;s High School, Annapolis, Maryland
* Robert A. Pascal Youth &amp; Family Services, Inc., Odenton, Maryland

==Philanthropy==
Pascal donated $6 million to Duke University to help fund the construction of an indoor practice facility for the Duke football team. The facility was later named the Pascal Field House in his honor.

==Personal life==
Pascal had four daughters, Catherine Anne, Margaret, Clara, and Robin.

<doc id="1184646" wikidata="Q5603211" url="?curid=1184646" title="Green Society">
<text>The Green Society was a small New Zealand political party dedicated to environmentalism. It was established in the spring of 1994 by former members of the Green Party, including Hans Grueber, Chris Marshall, and Peter Whitmore. They opposed the decision by the Green Party to become part of the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition – they stated that this &quot;abandoned a long tradition of being an independent green political force&quot;, diluting the group&#x27;s pure environmental focus. At the same time, they were critical of another Green Party off-shoot, the Progressive Green Party, for being too close to the right and therefore not independent either. The Green Society described itself as the only truly &quot;green&quot; party in the New Zealand political environment.

In its manifesto, the Green Society described itself as &quot;the party caring for your earth and her people&quot;, and its policies emphasised environmental protection, personal autonomy, and self-reliance. Political commentator Bryce Edwards described them as representing a &quot;lifestyler&quot; and &quot;hippie&quot; branch of the green movement, contrasting with a left-wing activist branch (the Green Party) and a pragmatic centrist branch (the Progressive Green Party). Colin James, another political journalist, characterised the group which gave rise to the Green Society as having an &quot;almost mystic&quot;, holistic approach to environmentalism, valuing a spiritual or intuitive relationship with nature rather than scientific one.

In the 1996 election, the Green Society&#x27;s top-ranked candidate was Simon Reeves, an environmental lawyer who also contested the Auckland Central electorate. The party contested eight electorates as well as the party list, but gained only 1,140 electorate and 2,363 list votes (0.11%), failing to win any seats.

The party did not contest the 1999 election and was deregistered in February 2001.

<doc id="1184649" wikidata="Q5358231" url="?curid=1184649" title="Electronic Communications Privacy Act">
<text>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) was enacted by the United States Congress to extend restrictions on government wire taps of telephone calls to include transmissions of electronic data by computer ( &quot;et seq.&quot;), added new provisions prohibiting access to stored electronic communications, i.e., the Stored Communications Act (SCA, &quot;et seq.&quot;), and added so-called pen trap provisions that permit the tracing of telephone communications ( &quot;et seq.&quot;).
ECPA was an amendment to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (the Wiretap Statute), which was primarily designed to prevent unauthorized government access to private electronic communications. The ECPA has been amended by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994, the USA PATRIOT Act (2001), the USA PATRIOT reauthorization acts (2006), and the FISA Amendments Act (2008).

== Overview ==
&quot;Electronic communications&quot; means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptic system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but excludes the following:
* Wire or oral communication
* Communication made through a tone-only paging device
* Communication from a tracking device (as defined in section 3117)
* Electronic funds transfer information stored by a financial institution in a communications system used for the electronic storage and transfer of funds

Title I of the ECPA protects wire, oral, and electronic communications while in transit. It sets down requirements for search warrants that are more stringent than in other settings. Title II of the ECPA, the Stored Communications Act (SCA), protects communications held in electronic storage, most notably messages stored on computers. Its protections are weaker than those of Title I, however, and do not impose heightened standards for warrants. Title III prohibits the use of pen register and/or trap and trace devices to record dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information used in the process of transmitting wire or electronic communications without a court order.

== History ==

The law was first brought to attention after the Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion, where electrical engineer John R. MacDougall hacked into the HBO signal on April 27, 1986.

As a consequence, this act was passed. This act also made satellite hijacking a felony.

== Provisions ==
The ECPA extended government restrictions on wire taps from telephone calls to include transmissions of electronic data by computer ( &quot;et seq.&quot;), added new provisions prohibiting access to stored electronic communications, i.e., the Stored Communications Act ( &quot;et seq.&quot;), and added so-called pen/trap provisions that permit the tracing of telephone communications ( &quot;et seq.&quot;).

 provides for gag orders which direct the recipient of a pen register or trap and trace device order not to disclose the existence of the pen/trap or the investigation.

=== Employee privacy ===
The ECPA extended privacy protections provided by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (of employers monitoring of employees phone calls) to include also electronic and cell phone communications. &quot;See also Employee monitoring and Workplace privacy&quot;.

== Case law ==
Several court cases have raised the question of whether e-mail messages are protected under the stricter provisions of Title I while they were in transient storage en route to their final destination. In &quot;United States v. Councilman&quot;, a U.S. district court and a three-judge appeals panel ruled they were not, but in 2005, the full United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed this opinion. Privacy advocates were relieved; they had argued in amicus curiae briefs that if the ECPA did not protect e-mail in temporary storage, its added protections were meaningless as virtually all electronic mail is stored temporarily in transit at least once and that Congress would have known this in 1986 when the law was passed. (see, e.g., RFC 822). The case was eventually dismissed on grounds unrelated to ECPA issues.

The seizure of a computer, used to operate an electronic bulletin board system, and containing private electronic mail which had been sent to (stored on) the bulletin board, but not read (retrieved) by the intended recipients, does not constitute an unlawful intercept under the Federal Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. s 2510, et seq., as amended by Title I of ECPA.
Governments can actually track cell phones in real time without a search warrant under ECPA by analyzing information as to antennae being contacted by cell phones, as long as the cell phone is used in public where visual surveillance is available.

In &quot;Robbins v. Lower Merion School District&quot; (2010), also known as &quot;WebcamGate&quot;, the plaintiffs charged that two suburban Philadelphia high schools violated ECPA by remotely activating the webcams embedded in school-issued laptops and monitoring the students at home. The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and screenshots, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms.

== Criticism ==

ECPA has been criticized for failing to protect all communications and consumer records, mainly because the law is so outdated and out of touch with how people currently share, store, and use information.

Under ECPA, it is relatively easy for a government agency to demand service providers hand over personal consumer data stored on the service provider&#x27;s servers. Email that is stored on a third party&#x27;s server for more than 180 days is considered by the law to be abandoned. All that is required to obtain the content of the emails by a law enforcement agency is a written statement certifying that the information is relevant to an investigation, without judicial review. When the law was initially passed, emails were stored on a third party&#x27;s server for only a short period of time, just long enough to facilitate transfer of email to the consumer&#x27;s email client, which was generally located on their personal or work computer. Now, with online email services prevalent such as Gmail and Hotmail, users are more likely to store emails online indefinitely, rather than to only keep them for less than 180 days. If the same emails were stored on the user&#x27;s personal computer, it would require the police to obtain a warrant first for seizure of their contents, regardless of their age. When they are stored on an internet server however, no warrant is needed, starting 180 days after receipt of the message, under the law. In 2013, members of the U.S. Congress proposed to reform this procedure.

ECPA also increased the list of crimes that can justify the use of surveillance, as well as the number of judicial members who can authorize such surveillance. Data can be obtained on traffic and calling patterns of an individual or a group without a warrant, allowing an agency to gain valuable intelligence and possibly invade privacy without any scrutiny, because the actual content of the communication is left untouched. While workplace communications are, in theory, protected, all that is needed to gain access to communiqué is for an employer to simply give notice or a supervisor to report that the employee&#x27;s actions are not in the company&#x27;s interest. This means that, with minimal assumptions, an employer can monitor communications within the company. The ongoing debate is, where to limit the government&#x27;s power to see into civilian lives, while balancing the need to curb national threats.

In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published &quot;1986 Privacy Law Is Outrun by the Web&quot;, highlighting that:
...the Justice Department argued in court that cellphone users had given up the expectation of privacy about their location by voluntarily giving that information to carriers. In April, it argued in a federal court in Colorado that it ought to have access to some e-mails without a search warrant. And federal law enforcement officials, citing technology advances, plan to ask for new regulations that would smooth their ability to perform legal wiretaps of various Internet communications.
The analysis went on to discuss how Google, Facebook, Verizon, Twitter and other companies are in the middle between users and governments.

<text>The War Lover is a 1962 British war film directed by Philip Leacock and written by Howard Koch, loosely based on the 1959 novel by John Hersey, altering the names of characters and events but retaining its basic framework. It stars Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner and Shirley Anne Field.

The war itself is not the most important element of the film. Instead, it focuses on the character of Captain Buzz Rickson and his determination to serve himself and get what he wants – in the process antagonising everyone.

==Plot==
Capt. Buzz Rickson commands a B-17 bomber in Britain during World War II. On a mission over Germany, Rickson&#x27;s commanding officer, Col. Emmet, aborts the bomber group&#x27;s attack due to cloud cover. Instead of obeying his superior, Rickson dives under the clouds and completes the mission. He believes Emmet will tolerate his insubordination because he&#x27;s the group&#x27;s best pilot. And although the group&#x27;s flight surgeon is uncertain whether Rickson is hero or psychopath, Rickson&#x27;s crew, especially his co-pilot, Lt. Ed Bolland, trust his intuitive flying skills.

Between missions, Rickson and Bolland meet a young Englishwoman, Daphne Caldwell. Although she is attracted to both pilots, she chooses Bolland. They soon fall in love. Meanwhile, Bolland becomes increasingly disillusioned with Rickson. The crew&#x27;s popular navigator, Lt. Marty Lynch, is pressured to transfer to another crew after he questions Rickson&#x27;s behaviour. Lynch even tells Bolland, &quot;Give Rickson a bomber and a machine gun, and he could be on either side.&quot; Lynch is soon killed in action. Bolland takes it hard and blames Rickson. Later, while on liberty, Rickson makes a move on Daphne, visiting her in her London flat after Bolland has returned to the base. Daphne rejects his forceful advances, telling him she loves Bolland.

The next morning, on a mission over Germany, Colonel Emmet&#x27;s plane is shot down, making Rickson group commander. Rickson&#x27;s plane drops its bombs on target, but there&#x27;s a cost. The plane is badly shot up by Messerschmitts, killing one of the crew. Further, its bomb bay doors are stuck open with one armed bomb still on its rack. As the plane nears the English coastline, an air-sea rescue team is contacted and the crew bails out – all except Rickson, who is determined to bring the bomber back to base. Instead, he crashes into the white cliffs on the Kent coast. Afterwards, Bolland reports Rickson&#x27;s death to Daphne in Cambridge. She concludes, &quot;It&#x27;s what he always wanted.&quot; The lovers walk away together.
==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The War Lover&quot; was filmed in Britain at RAF Bovingdon in Hertfordshire, RAF Manston in Kent, around Cambridgeshire (including in the grounds of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge), and at Shepperton Studios in Surrey.

Shirley Ann Field says she turned down the lead in &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; to make the movie. &quot;I chose the option to go to Hollywood, who wouldn&#x27;t?... Although I have to say I don&#x27;t think director Philip Leacock was strong enough... I just think it could have been better.&quot; Field&#x27;s casting was announced in July 1961.

Three Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers formed the main aerial component in the film, and were composed of one B-17G and two postwar PB-1W Coast Guard rescue aircraft located in the United States. After extensive modifications, the three warbirds flew the arduous transatlantic crossing to Britain. Martin Caidin, who would later write the novels on which the TV series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and the film &quot;Marooned&quot; were based, was one of the pilots who flew the B-17s for the film. Caidin chronicled the adventures of the crossing in the book &quot;Everything But The Flak.&quot;

&quot;The War Lover&quot; was shot in 1961 and released in the United States on 25 October 1962. The film opened in London in June 1963. Some short but rare footage of actual air combat is included – especially the attacking Messerschmitt Bf 109G armed with 20 mm cannon firing at the B-17s. The film also makes use of the crash landing footage from the 1949 film &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;.

Mike Reilly, a stuntman doubling for Robert Wagner, was killed during the production of &quot;The War Lover&quot; when he fell to his death in a parachuting accident.

In 2003, Sony Pictures colourised the film, but the colour version has yet to be released on home video.

==Reception==
&quot;The War Lover&quot; was unfavourably compared to other wartime aviation epics like &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949). Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; focused on the lack of interesting characters in the film. &quot;But the fellows who sit in the cockpit of the one plane on which the actions center are a dull pair and are rendered even duller by poor acting and weak direction. Steve McQueen is the emotionally-mixed-up pilot who tries to steal his co-pilot&#x27;s girl. Robert Wagner is the co-pilot and Shirley Anne Fields is the girl. Altogether they make what at best is an average drama of love and jealousy into a small and tepid expose of one man&#x27;s absurd cantankerousness.&quot;

In a similar vein, the review of &quot;The War Lover&quot; in &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;...the central character emerges more of an unappealing symbol than a sympathetic flesh-and-blood portrait... The scenario seems reluctant to come to grips with the issue of this character&#x27;s unique personality – a &#x27;war lover&#x27; whose exaggerated shell of heroic masculinity covers up a psychopathic inability to love or enjoy normal relationships with women.&quot;

<text>Body for Life (BFL) is a 12-week nutrition and exercise program, and also an annual physique transformation competition. The program utilizes a low-fat high-protein diet. It was created by Bill Phillips, a former competitive bodybuilder and previous owner of EAS, a manufacturer of nutritional supplements. 
It has been popularized by a bestselling book of the same name.

Medical experts have described Body for Life as being effective, if difficult to follow. It has sometimes been described as a fad diet, but this criticism is not universal.

== Exercise ==
The human body adapts itself to changes in nutritional intake. If the calorie intake is reduced, the body responds by slowing down its metabolism, and by burning muscle in preference to fat. This reduces the metabolism long-term. When the diet comes to an end and normal calorie intake is restored, the individual starts to gain weight even faster than before. This is known as yo-yo dieting. Diets that focus exclusively on calorie reduction often fail in this way.

With these concerns in mind, Body for Life addresses energy expenditure (i.e. exercise) in addition to energy input. For best results, Body for Life holds that this exercise should include weight training to build skeletal muscle and increase the metabolism over the long term. This also helps to maximise the energy expenditure and fat loss from aerobic exercise.

Body for Life&#x27;s exercise program is more complicated than its diet program. It suggests exercising six days a week, normally Monday to Saturday, for 45 minutes and alternating between weight training and aerobic exercise. The seventh day, usually Sunday, is a rest day (referred to as the &quot;free day&quot;, during which no exercise is done and unhealthy, normally fatty foods may be eaten). Weight training sessions alternate between exercises for the upper body and exercises for the lower body. This allows the exercised muscles enough time to recover fully before the next training session. Each fortnight follows the same pattern:

Intensity index

Body for Life uses Gunnar Borg&#x27;s Rating of Perceived Exertion (known as the Borg scale) for assessing the intensity of exercise based on how hard you feel you are working. It uses the variant developed by the American College of Sports Medicine, which uses a scale of 0 to 10: 
* 0 is no exertion at all.
* 2 corresponds to very light exercise. For a healthy person, this is like walking slowly at their own pace for several minutes.
* 5 on the scale is somewhat hard exercise, but it still feels OK to continue.
* 8 is very strenuous. A healthy person can still go on, but they really have to push themselves. It feels very heavy, and the person is very tired.
* 9 on the scale is an extremely strenuous exercise level. For most people this is the most strenuous exercise they have ever experienced.
* 10 is maximal exertion: an all-out, 100% effort.

These levels accommodate differences in fitness. An unfit individual may require a level 10 effort to walk briskly uphill, whereas for a competitive athlete this may only be a level 3 effort. Over the course of the 12-week Body for Life program an individual would get noticeably fitter, so their intensity scale needs to be adjusted over time. 

Body for Life uses a &quot;wave&quot; pattern, periodically building up from level 5 to level 9 or 10 during an exercise session. This allows the muscles to warm up, and gives the body a chance to build up to a &quot;high point&quot; of maximal exertion. Brief but intense exercise provides maximum stimulus for the body to build strength and endurance, but without the risk of overtraining.

=== Weight training ===

Exercises for upper-body muscle groups include:
* &quot;Pecs&quot; (chest), e.g., bench press, pec-deck, incline fly.
* &quot;Lats&quot; (upper back), e.g., pull-down, bent-over row, dumbbell pullover.
* Deltoids (shoulders), e.g., upright row, shoulder press, lateral raise.
* Triceps (rear arms), e.g., push-down, triceps kickback, bench dip.
* Biceps (front arms), e.g., biceps curl, concentration curl, hammer curl.

Exercises for lower-body muscle groups include:
* Quadriceps (front legs), e.g., squat, leg press, leg extension.
* Hamstrings (rear legs), e.g., leg curl, lunge, glute-ham raise.
* Calves e.g., standing calf raise, seated calf raise.
* &quot;Abs&quot; (torso), e.g., crunch, reverse crunch, leg raise.

Most of these exercise can be performed using either dumbbells, a barbell, a Smith machine, a cable machine with adjustable pulleys or a specially-designed apparatus. Two exercises should be chosen for each muscle group. Five sets of the first exercise are performed, and then one set of the second. Weights for each set should be chosen so that the specified number of repetitions can be achieved at the specified level of intensity. For example:Weight training sessions proceed at a brisk pace, with one minute of rest between the first four sets for a muscle group, and no rest between the final two sets. The cadence for each repetition should be one second to lift the weight (while exhaling deeply), one second holding it at the top, two seconds to lower the weight (while inhaling deeply) and then one second pausing before the next repetition. Each session should be completed within about 45 minutes.

=== Aerobic exercise ===
Most forms of aerobic exercise are suitable. Common choices include walking or running (perhaps on a treadmill), cycling, swimming, or the use of a rowing machine or cross-trainer. However, exercise classes are generally not suitable, unless they are specifically designed to suit Body for Life.

Aerobic exercise sessions are limited to 20 minutes duration. They compensate for this by following the same &quot;wave&quot; pattern of steadily increasing intensity just like the weight training sessions. The aerobic, often referred to as cardio, sessions are a modified High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). 

During the first 2 minutes, intensity should be at 5. Minutes 3, 4, 5, and 6 should be at intensity levels 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively. Minute 7 goes back down to 6 intensity level and continues the wave pattern until the 19th minute where you push intensity level to 10. The last minute is a cool down to 5 intensity. You should be completely exhausted at this point so stretch afterwards.

Phillips maintains that aerobic exercise is more effective for fat loss when done first thing in the morning, because it raises the metabolism for the remainder of the day, and because the body draws more heavily on its fat stores after fasting overnight.

== Diet ==

BFL promotes a low-fat high-protein diet.

Another key aspect of BFL is consuming a diet that is low enough in caloric intake to cause fat loss, while providing enough calories and protein to build muscle and cardiovascular endurance. In addition, BFL attempts to make choosing portion sizes and food as easy as possible to avoid overcomplication. The major aspects of the diet program include:

*Eating 6 smaller meals per day instead of the standard 3 large meals. BFL (along with some dietary experts) maintain that eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day will boost the body&#x27;s metabolism, causing it to burn fat faster.
*Eating one &quot;portion&quot; of carbohydrates and one &quot;portion&quot; of protein at each meal. To keep determining portion sizes simple, BFL suggests that one &quot;portion&quot; of carbohydrates should equal a potato or ball of rice roughly equal to the size of the person&#x27;s clenched fist. Additionally, one &quot;portion&quot; of protein would roughly equal a piece of meat the size of the person&#x27;s palm and as thick as a deck of cards.
*Consuming vegetables with at least two meals per day.
*Taking a good multi-vitamin.
*Limiting consumption of butter, cheese, mayonnaise, alcoholic beverages, and high fat salad dressings.
*Allowance of one &quot;free day&quot; each week. A free day is one day a week in which the person is allowed to make dietary choices that do not correspond with the BFL eating program. Although this should not be a day to binge eat junk food, BFL encourages people to eat whatever foods or desserts they desire on this day. According to Bill Phillips, this allows the body to avoid the Starvation response and gives the dieter a chance to avoid cheating since they know they simply have to wait until their free day to have what they crave.

Body for Life also encourages people to eat mostly lean meats like chicken, fish, and turkey, as well as tofu. Carbohydrates that are multi-grain and unrefined are also encouraged. Bill Phillips encourages people to adopt this eating program as a lifestyle, and not as a temporary diet. Although the amount of protein eaten should be enough for some people to build good muscle mass, some observe that high-protein shakes and meal bars should be consumed to increase protein intake. Not surprisingly, the program suggests consuming protein products from EAS.

==Reception==

No scientific research has been done on Body for Life. 

The Body for Life program has been described by some as a hard to follow program that is effective at losing weight and building muscle.

While criticized by some as a fad diet, the &quot;program&#x27;s success is based on testimonials and anecdotal evidence&quot;, it differs from many fad diets because it can be sustained.

The program&#x27;s dependence on extensive exercise (45 minute workouts, six days a week), means it is not suitable for everyone.

The high-protein content of the diet has been criticized. &quot;The Gale Encyclopedia of Diets&quot;, notes that:

The thing nutritionists tend to criticize most strongly, however, is the perceived need for dietary supplements in this program. Bill Phillips, the originator of Body for Life, used to unabashedly recommend dieters use EAS supplements, a company Bill Phillips was CEO of, to achieve better results. Since he sold EAS, he no longer recommends those products. He now recommends his products sold in the Bill Phillips Fitness Store at eatingright.com. Many nutritionists feel that a good, healthy diet should not require protein shakes and other supplements beyond perhaps a multivitamin for certain dieters.

<doc id="1184657" wikidata="Q3061209" url="?curid=1184657" title="Euzkadi (newspaper)">
<text>Euzkadi was a daily newspaper published in Bilbao, Basque Country. Its first edition was on 1 February 1913. 

&quot;Euzkadi&quot; published texts both in Basque and Spanish, and it employed one editor-in-chief for each language. The first editor-in-chief for Basque was writer Evaristo &quot;Kirikiño&quot; Bustintza.

One of the Basque nationalist journalists who wrote for the paper was Manuel Aznar Zubigaray, who later would become a falangist. He was the grandfather of eventual Spanish prime minister José María Aznar.

&quot;Euzkadi&quot; supported the branch of Basque Nationalist Party that was called &quot;Comunión Nacionalista Vasca&quot; (&quot;Basque Nationalist Communion&quot;) after the party had split in 1921. 

In June 1937, after the &quot;national&quot; forces had occupied Bilbao during the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Euzkadi&quot;&#x27;s publication there was cancelled. Its premises were offered to &quot;El Correo Español&quot; which then was the newspaper of Spanish Falange.

Basque nationalist refugees continued the publication of &quot;Euzkadi&quot; in Barcelona in 1938–1939.

<text>Prudential Financial, Inc. is an American company whose subsidiaries provide insurance, retirement planning, investment management, and other products and services to both retail and institutional customers throughout the United States and in over 40 other countries. In 2019, Prudential was the largest insurance provider in the United States with $815.1 billion in total assets. The company is included in the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 and &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 rankings.

==Logo==
The use of Prudential&#x27;s symbol, the Rock of Gibraltar, began after an advertising agent passed Laurel Hill, a volcanic neck, in Secaucus, New Jersey, on a train in the 1890s. The related slogans &quot;Get a Piece of the Rock&quot; and &quot;Strength of Gibraltar&quot; are also still quite widely associated with Prudential, though current advertising uses neither of these. Through the years, the symbol went through various versions, but in 1989, a simplified pictogram symbol of the Rock of Gibraltar was adopted and has been used ever since. The logotype was updated with a proprietary font in 1996. The font, Prudential Roman, was designed by Doyald Young and John March, based on the Century font family.

==History==
Started in Newark, New Jersey, in 1875, Prudential was originally called The Widows and Orphans Friendly Society, then the Prudential Friendly Society. It was founded by John F. Dryden, who later became a U.S. Senator. In the beginning, the company sold only one product, burial insurance. Dryden was the president of Prudential until 1912. He was succeeded by his son Forrest F. Dryden, who was the president until 1922.
A history of The Prudential Insurance Company of America up to about 1975 is the topic of the book &quot;Three Cents A Week&quot;, referring to the premium paid by early policyholders.

At the turn of the 20th century, Prudential and other large insurers reaped the bulk of their profits from industrial life insurance, or insurance sold by solicitors house-to-house in poor urban areas. For their insurance, industrial workers paid double what others paid for ordinary life insurance, and due to high lapse rates, as few as 1 in 12 policies reached maturity. Prominent lawyer and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis helped pass a 1907 Massachusetts law to protect workers by allowing savings banks to sell life insurance at lower rates.


Prudential has evolved from a mutual insurance company (owned by its policyholders) to a joint stock company (as it was prior to 1915). It is now traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PRU. The Prudential Stock was issued and started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on December 13, 2001.

On August 1, 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the discovery of terrorist threats against the Prudential Headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, prompting large-scale security measures that included concrete barriers outside the premises and internal X-ray machines. In the same year, a joint venture was formed between Prudential and China Everbright Limited.

On November 28, 2007, the Prudential board of directors elected a new CEO, John R. Strangfeld, to replace retiring Arthur F. Ryan.

==Acquisitions and divestitures==
In 1981, the company acquired Bache &amp; Co., a stock brokerage service that operated as a wholly owned subsidiary until 2003, when Wachovia and Prudential combined their retail brokerage operations into Wachovia Securities, with Prudential a minority stake holder. In 1999, Prudential sold its healthcare division, Prudential HealthCare, to Aetna for $1 billion.

On May 1, 2003, Prudential formalized the acquisition of American Skandia, the largest distributor of variable annuities through independent financial professionals in the United States. The CEO of American Skandia, Wade Dokken, partnered with Goldman Sachs and sold the division to Prudential for $1.2 billion. The combination of American Skandia variable annuities and Prudential fixed annuities was part of Prudential&#x27;s strategy to acquire complementary businesses that help meet retirement goals.

In April 2004, the company acquired the retirement business of CIGNA Corporation. In late 2009, Prudential sold its minority stake in Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings LLC to Wells Fargo &amp; Co. In 2011, Prudential sold Prudential Bache Commodities, LLC to Jefferies.

In February 2011, the company acquired AIG Edison and AIG Star both in Japan from American International Group, Inc (AIG) for a total of $4.8 billion. This acquisition bolstered Prudential&#x27;s operations in Asia while giving cash to AIG to pay back the federal government from its bailout in 2008.

In January 2013, the company acquired the individual life insurance business from The Hartford for $615 million in cash. The acquisition includes 700,000 in force life insurance policies with a face amount of approximately $135 billion. This move by Prudential brought over additional life insurance revenue.

In September 2019, the company agreed to acquire online startup Assurance IQ Inc. for $2.35 billion. Assurance has underperformed financial expectations, and industry commentators believe Prudential paid too much for the acquisition.

==Controversies==

===Investor fraud===
During the 1980s and 1990s, Prudential Securities Incorporated (PSI), formerly a division of Prudential Financial, was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for suspected fraud. During the investigation, it was found that PSI had defrauded investors of close to $8 billion, the largest fraud found by the SEC in US history to that point. The SEC charged that Prudential allowed rogue executives to cheat customers on a large scale and blithely ignored a 1986 SEC order to overhaul its internal enforcement of securities laws. In all, some 400,000 individual investors lost money on the deals.

In 1993, Prudential Financial eventually settled with investors for $330 million. Prudential said it would repay customers across the U.S. who lost money on the company&#x27;s limited partnerships in the 1980s. In addition, the firm was required to pay another $41 million in fines. The settlement also resolved investigations of the firm by the National Association of Securities Dealers and 49 states, including California, where 52,000 investors lost money in Prudential limited partnerships. Further investigation was conducted by the SEC into the executives of the company to determine the extent of the fraud.

===Class action lawsuit over sales practices===

In 1997, Prudential settled a class action lawsuit by millions of its customers who had been sold unnecessary life insurance by Prudential agents over a 13-year period ending in 1995. The settlement called for Prudential to repay an estimated $2 billion to customers through direct refunds and enhancements to existing policies. The settlement had been the subject of extensive negotiations involving not only Prudential and its customers, but also insurance regulators in 30 states. Prudential had agreed in early 1997 to pay a fine of $35 million to settle state allegations of deceptive sales practices. Prudential acknowledged that for more than a decade its agents had improperly persuaded customers to cash in old policies and purchase new ones so that the agents could generate additional sales commissions.

===US military life insurance lawsuit===
In 2010, various media outlets noted allegations that the Prudential Life Insurance Company was manipulating the payout of life insurance benefits due to the families of American soldiers in order to gain extra profits. The company provided life insurance to people in the armed forces under a government contract. Rather than paying the full amount due to the families at once, the company would instead deposit the funds into a Prudential corporate account. These accounts are referred to as &#x27;retained asset accounts&#x27; and are essentially an I.O.U. from the company to the payee (in many cases a fallen service members&#x27; family). While Prudential was making profits of up to 4.2% in its general account in early 2010, they paid out 0.5% interest in these non-FDIC insured &quot;Alliance&quot; accounts. In some cases, when families requested to be sent a full payout in the form of a check, the family was sent a checkbook, rather than the amount due.

It is not clear if the practice was in violation of law or the contract. In August 2010, the company was sued by a number of the bereaved families. The company&#x27;s response included an open letter to the military community in which it addressed what it characterized as &quot;misinformation&quot; about the nature of the accounts. &quot;Military Times&quot; noted that prior lawsuits against insurance companies pertaining to the use of retained asset accounts have been dismissed in federal courts without action.

==Ratings, awards and The Prudential Foundation==
Prudential has received a 100% rating on the Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign every year since 2003, the second year of the report. In addition, the company is in the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; of &quot;Working Mothers&quot; magazine among other companies that have made their &quot;100 Best Companies for Working Mothers&quot; list for 15 or more years. It is still achieving that list, as of 2013. According to Business Week&#x27;s &quot;The Best Places to Launch a Career 2008&quot;, Prudential Insurance was ranked #59 out of 119 companies on the list. In 2007, The Prudential Foundation provided over $450,000 in Prudential CARES Volunteer Grants to 444 nonprofit organizations worldwide. The Prudential CARES Volunteer Grants Program recognizes individual and team volunteers based on a minimum of 40 hours of volunteer service per individual. Grants range from $250 to $5,000 for each award winner&#x27;s charitable organization. Prudential ranked #69 on the 2017 Forbes World’s Biggest Public Companies list, calling out their $45.6 billion market value. Prudential ranked No. 52 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. As of 2019, Prudential is the largest insurance provider in the United States with $815.1 billion in total assets.

<doc id="1184660" wikidata="Q5450248" url="?curid=1184660" title="Finger tab">
<text>In archery, a finger tab or archer tab is a small leather or synthetic patch that protects an archer&#x27;s fingers from the bowstring. It is strapped or otherwise attached to an archer&#x27;s hand. In summertime, tabs are far more comfortable than gloves and can more conveniently use thicker material. They are also less expensive and easier to fit, and are the normal finger-protection used with recurve bows.

The tab usually has a retaining loop on the back of the tab that fits over the middle finger, which is simply there to keep the tab on the fingers when the string is loosed. Tabs come in various forms. The simplest is made of a single patch that is placed below the nocking point between the fingers and the string. This style of shooting is called &#x27;three finger under&#x27;. These are most often used in barebow styles of archery.

More complex tabs have a split about one third down the leading edge so that the fingers can be placed with one finger above and two fingers below the nocking point of the arrow. This style of shooting is called split finger or Mediterranean draw. The tab may also have a platform that is attached to the back of the tab and forms a flat cover over the top, to give the archer a hard reference point underneath the chin when the string is drawn back. Platform tabs are more common for recurve or Olympic-class target archery.

A thumb ring or thumb tab is used similarly to protect the thumb by archers practising the Mongolian draw. The Japanese yugake is a reinforced glove with a special ridge which holds the string. 

In the past 25 years mechanical releases have become popular. The mechanism is usually attached to the wrist; it holds the string, and releases it when triggered. These are usually used with compound bows.

The term &quot;tab&quot; is of uncertain etymology, perhaps an alteration of tag (small hanging piece).

<doc id="1184662" wikidata="Q5975940" url="?curid=1184662" title="I Am Charlotte Simmons">
<text>I Am Charlotte Simmons is a 2004 novel by Tom Wolfe, concerning sexual and status relationships at the fictional Dupont University. Wolfe researched the novel by talking to students at North Carolina, Florida, Penn, Duke, Stanford, and Michigan. Wolfe suggested it depicts the American university today at a fictional college that is &quot;Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Duke, and a few other places all rolled into one.&quot;

==Plot==
&quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot; is the story of college student Charlotte Simmons&#x27;s first semester-and-a-half at the prestigious Dupont University. A high school graduate from a poverty-stricken rural town, her intelligence and hard work at school have been rewarded with a full scholarship to Dupont.

As Charlotte prepares to say goodbye to her family and leave for college, an event happens at Dupont that will play an important role in her future. Hoyt Thorpe, member of the exclusive and powerful fraternity Saint Ray, and fellow frat brother Vance, stumble upon an unnamed California Republican governor (who was at the college to speak at the school&#x27;s commencement ceremony) receiving oral sex from a female college student. When the governor&#x27;s bodyguard spots the two fraternity members, a fight ensues with Hoyt and Vance beating up the bodyguard and fleeing. The story of the night soon spreads across campus, increasing Hoyt&#x27;s popularity.

Charlotte arrives at Dupont in the fall. Her roommate is wealthy Beverly, the daughter of the CEO of a huge multinational insurance company. She is obsessed with sex, in particular with members of the school&#x27;s lacrosse team.

Jojo Johanssen is a white athlete on the college&#x27;s predominantly black basketball team. He is struggling to keep his position because the school recently recruited an up-and-coming black freshman player, and the coach wants to bench Jojo in his senior year. This would severely hurt Jojo&#x27;s chances of playing in &quot;the league&quot; (the NBA).

Jojo enjoys the spoils of being a college athlete, such as using a tutor program to force other students to complete his school assignments. Jojo&#x27;s &quot;tutor&quot; Adam Gellin is, like Charlotte, from a working-class background. Adam writes for the college&#x27;s independent newspaper and is a member of the &quot;Millennial Mutants,&quot; a group of like-minded intellectuals who oppose the anti-intellectualism and class snobbery they see in their fellow students.

Charlotte and Adam first meet at the university&#x27;s computer lab, where Adam is to write a paper for Jojo. Charlotte does not back down when Adam insists that he needs the computer more than she does. Adam is instantly smitten.

Charlotte finds herself dealing with the sexual temptations of college life, culminating in her hooking up with Hoyt, who tells Charlotte of catching California&#x27;s governor receiving oral sex from a college student. He also tells Charlotte he knows that Adam Gellin has begun investigating the incident and how, at the behest of the governor a large Wall Street firm has offered Hoyt a high-paying entry-level job in exchange for his silence. (The firm, Pierce &amp; Pierce, is the name of the one that Sherman McCoy works for in Wolfe&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;.)

Hoyt and Charlotte attend an important fraternity formal together, after which Hoyt takes full advantage of a drunken Charlotte, seducing her into giving up her virginity to him. The following morning, Charlotte is dumped by Hoyt. She is further humiliated when she returns to campus and discovers that Hoyt&#x27;s seduction and rejection has been made public via two girls Charlotte had previously befriended. The two cruelly mock Charlotte, both over her poverty-stricken background, and for how she drunkenly lost her virginity.

This drives Charlotte into a depression and eventually into the arms of Adam, who has wanted Charlotte for her beauty, innocence, and intellect since they first met. Charlotte finally emerges from her depression but finds that she has received terrible grades (B, B−, C−, D) for her first semester at Dupont.

As Adam prepares to publish his article, his world collides with Jojo Johanssen&#x27;s when a paper that Adam wrote for the athlete is accused of being plagiarized. Jojo, who treats Adam as beneath him socially, denies the plagiarism charge and protects the athletic department&#x27;s perversion of the athlete/tutor program from being exposed.

Jojo has begun to transform himself academically from a stereotypical &quot;dumb jock&quot; into a student who takes his academics seriously and even develops an interest in philosophy (partly as a result of Charlotte&#x27;s influence). Jerome Quat, Jojo&#x27;s professor, confronts Adam about the plagiarized paper and shows sympathy toward him in a college dominated by students obsessed with sports and sex. However, when Adam confesses to having written the paper for Jojo, the professor double-crosses him. He will sacrifice Adam in order to bring down the basketball program, which has circled the wagons to protect Jojo.

This devastates Adam, who breaks down and needs Charlotte to take care of him as he waits to be formally charged with cheating. In the meantime, Adam&#x27;s article on &quot;The Night of the Skullfuck&quot; is published. The sordid details of sex, violence, bribery, and a high-profile political figure cause it to be picked up by the national media. The governor&#x27;s Presidential ambitions are potentially ruined, and the job offer/bribe made to Hoyt is revoked, effectively shattering Hoyt&#x27;s life.

Hoyt now faces a post-graduation judgment day, with his family&#x27;s life savings exhausted in order to pay for his college education, and a college transcript with such bad grades that it will effectively keep him from getting a job as an investment banker. Jojo&#x27;s and Adam&#x27;s necks are saved, as the liberal college professor decides to drop the entire plagiarism complaint so as to avoid undercutting Adam&#x27;s credibility in destroying the conservative governor&#x27;s political career.

Adam&#x27;s self-esteem restored, he begins to bask in the glow as the student who brought down a governor. Adam and Charlotte drift apart and she begins to date Jojo, who keeps his position as a starter on the team, in fact becoming a far better player due to Charlotte&#x27;s influence and his decision to cultivate his mind. Charlotte ascends to the envied position of girlfriend of a star athlete. One scene at the end has Charlotte in Jojo&#x27;s large SUV when 2 of the sorority girls that previously mocked her pull up to say hi to Jojo and see Charlotte in the car and say hi like they are old friends. Later one of them invites Charlotte to join their sorority—when Charlotte says she doesn&#x27;t have money for that, she hints that something can be worked out.

Charlotte now reflects upon her first semester with a different view, looking down at her former friends, who gleefully gossiped about her humiliation, and at Hoyt, who casually threw her away. She no longer feels intellectualism is what is most important to her—rather it is being a person recognized as special, regardless of the reason.

==Major themes==
The book develops themes Wolfe introduces in the title essay from his book &quot;Hooking Up&quot;. The novel centers on Charlotte, a naive new student at Dupont University, a school boasting a top-ranked basketball program and an Ivy League academic reputation. Despite Dupont&#x27;s elite status, in the minds of its students, sex, alcohol, and social status rule the day. The student culture is focused upon gaining material wealth, physical pleasure, and a well-placed social status; academics are only important insofar as they help achieve these goals.

==Research==
Wolfe took the name &quot;Dupont University&quot; from Dupont Hall, one of the halls where classes are held at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. The school discussed in the book appears to be an amalgamation of several elite universities. Wolfe denies that the book is fully based on Duke, from which his daughter Alexandra graduated in 2002.

The fictional &quot;St. Ray&#x27;s&quot; fraternity is most certainly based upon University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s St. Anthony Hall, or &quot;St. A&#x27;s,&quot; where Wolfe attended several events researching for the book, &quot;St. A&#x27;s&quot; being on Penn&#x27;s Locust Walk, with fictional &quot;St. Ray&#x27;s&quot; residing on Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Ladding Walk.&quot; 

The basketball star, Jojo Johanssen, is a jock/celebrity character, derived from colleges like the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Kentucky, Duke, Stanford, Indiana University and the University of Florida, where, in Wolfe&#x27;s perception, student athletes are treated as superior. At the time of publication, JJ Redick was a prominent white basketball player at Duke University. There is also a reference in the book to a freshman dormitory &quot;Giles&quot;, which is an actual freshman dorm at Duke University.

Besides college life, athletics, and youth sex culture, another major theme that also began in &quot;Hooking Up&quot; is Tom Wolfe&#x27;s interest in neuroscience, specifically the relationship between brain chemistry and free will. Simmons is exposed to questions about inevitability and genetics by her professor Dr. Victor Ransome Starling. (At Washington &amp; Lee James Holt Starling, Ph.D. was a faculty member from 1942 to 1983, a biology professor from 1951 to 1983 and a former head of the Biology Department.) In the context of the book, questions of free will are posed by the characters&#x27; various dramas as Charlotte decides whether or not she will adopt the sexual norms of campus life and Johanssen attempts to become a better student and more disciplined person generally. Despite the main characters seemingly confirming the science of inevitability, two side characters (Adam Gellin and Hoyt) are both altered considerably by a chance encounter with a presidential candidate.

==Reception==
Reviewer Jacob Weisberg of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Wolfe is always showing us something we haven&#x27;t quite noticed. But after three thick novels and a novella (surely he will never write a short story), the issue remains: Why does a writer whose ambitions are so fundamentally journalistic insist on processing his reportage into fiction? You may never put down a Tom Wolfe novel. But you never reread one, either.&quot;

London-based &quot;Literary Review&quot; gave Wolfe its 2004 Bad Sex in Fiction Award, an &quot;honor&quot; established &quot;to draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel&quot;, for his writing in &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot;.

Wolfe&#x27;s 2018 obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; referenced mixed reviews for the book.

U.S. President George W. Bush was a fan of the novel, and enthusiastically recommended it to his close friends. However, it was omitted from his official presidential reading list, likely due to the novel&#x27;s sexual content.

==Proposed adaptation==
In 2005, the film rights to &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot; were purchased by Trilogy Entertainment, with co-founder John Watson producing and writing the screenplay. Three years later, Liz Friedlander was attached as director, while HBO began looking at developing the book for television. In 2021, Veritas Entertainment acquired the television rights for &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot;. The series was reportedly being developed at Paramount Television Studios, with Brian Yorkey as showrunner.

<doc id="1184673" wikidata="Q5435751" url="?curid=1184673" title="Farmers' Alliance">
<text>The Farmers&#x27; Alliance was an organized agrarian economic movement among American farmers that developed and flourished ca. 1875. The movement included several parallel but independent political organizations — the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Industrial Union among the white farmers of the South, the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance among the white and black farmers of the Midwest and High Plains, where the Granger movement had been strong, and the Colored Farmers&#x27; National Alliance and Cooperative Union, consisting of the African American farmers of the South.

One of the goals of the organization was to end the adverse effects of the crop-lien system on farmers in the period following the American Civil War. The Alliance also generally supported the government regulation of the transportation industry, establishment of an income tax in order to restrict speculative profits, and the adoption of an inflationary relaxation of the nation&#x27;s money supply as a means of easing the burden of repayment of loans by debtors. The Farmers&#x27; Alliance moved into politics in the early 1890s under the banner of the People&#x27;s Party, commonly known as the &quot;Populists.&quot;

==Background==

===Agricultural crisis in the US Midwest and Plains===

The quest to achieve a First transcontinental railroad across the U.S. was delayed somewhat by the American Civil War before being finally completed in May 1869. There followed a rush to complete additional railway lines to open up new frontier areas for economic development, a situation in which the United States government and the great railroad companies of the day maintained a common interest. Rather than directly undertaking railroad construction as a public works project of the federal government, Congress granted cash loans and grants of public land to subsidize construction. Some 129 million acres (52.2 million hectares) of public land was ultimately transferred from public ownership to the privately owned railways as part of this process.

A great part of this massive stockpile of land needed to be converted into cash by the railways to finance their building activities, since railroad construction was a costly undertaking. New settlement had to be attracted to the virgin lands west of the Missouri River, which had been previously regarded by the public as worthless to the needs of agriculture due to insufficiencies of the soil as well as the arid climate. Millions of advertising dollars were spent by the railway companies promoting the agricultural development of the land which they had to sell. This effort was to be rewarded, particularly after the Panic of 1873 left many unemployed and seeking a new start. Settlers began to flood into the Midwest and Northern Great Plains in response to the railway companies&#x27; blandishments.

Populations skyrocketed. The state of Kansas grew from a population of just under 365,000 to nearly a million people during the 1870s. The number of inhabitants in Nebraska nearly tripled, rising to nearly half a million. Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakota Territory showed parallel population gains. New counties, villages, and towns sprang up by the hundreds throughout the region and a speculative bubble emerged around the buying and selling of farmland and urban lots. Population continued to surge throughout the region well into the decade of the 1880s.

Unfortunately for those who chose to attempt to farm new lands in such places as Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Eastern Colorado, the unusually rainy years of the early 1880s which had buoyed land prices gave way to a protracted drought beginning in the summer of 1887, bringing an end to the giddy, speculative boom. With crops failing, artificially inflated land prices plummeted; Eastern capital began to withdraw from the region. Banks collapsed and credit dried up. A decade of hard times followed, marked by the abandonment of entire communities. A sense of deep discontent with the current state of affairs was felt by the farmers who remained.

===Agricultural crisis in the southeastern US===

The agrarian and plantation-based economy of the Southern United States was virtually destroyed by the American Civil War. Those who had their fortunes invested in Confederate bonds and currency saw them lost, as did those whose wealth was tied up in the ownership of African American slaves. Great landed estates were broken up or rendered unworkable by the lack of a free labor supply and the flood of land sold on the marked depressed prices and reduced the economic possibilities of those who counted their dollars in acres.

The region faced enormous costs to replace the buildings destroyed in the war and the factories looted. The capacity of the gutted financial market to make loans was grossly insufficient for the needs of the region, exemplified by the 123 counties in Georgia with no banks whatsoever even in 1895. Merchants, finding a sellers&#x27; market, extracted extraordinary profits through inflated prices and usurious credit terms.

A new mode of production replaced the slave-based large-scale agriculture of the pre-war years. Now it would be small-scale agrarian enterprise that would proliferate and the emergence of the so-called &quot;share system&quot; or &quot;cropping system,&quot; in which non-landowners paid rent for the use of the land they farmed in the form of a fixed percentage of the output generated. This system in theory served the needs of landowners and poor farmers alike, as the sharecroppers would have the incentive to produce more and benefit from increased output while landowners would be provided with a labor source to produce upon the land they held without the necessity of paying cash wages.

In practice, however, a system of virtual slavery emerged, in which poor whites and freed blacks became enmeshed in the usury of merchants and landowners providing essential supplies on credit. A crop-lien system emerged in which future crops would be mortgaged to merchants or landowners (often one and the same) in exchange for credit for current purchases. Written contracts made these loans legally enforceable and those so enmeshed frequently found themselves forced to pay inflated prices at high rates of interest. If the value of the credit exceeded the cash value of the crop, the arrangement was automatically rolled over for another year and a never-ending cycle amounting to a condition of perpetual servitude resulted.

Moreover, this crop-lien system contributed to the establishment of a cotton monoculture, as merchants demanded this easily storable, readily marketable commodity to be produced for the satisfaction of debt. Not accidentally, the requirement by merchants for cotton production made production of adequate food and fodder for sustenance virtually impossible, further deepening the debt of the farmer to his merchant-creditor. A sense of deep discontent with the current state of affairs was felt by the small-holding and tenant farmers of the South.

==Organizational histories==

===The Northern Alliance===

The National Farmers&#x27; Alliance, commonly known as the &quot;Northern Alliance,&quot; was established on March 21, 1877, by a group of members of the Grange movement from New York state. The group sought to organize in order to fight what they deemed the unfair practices of the railroad transportation mill, for the reform of the tax system, and for the legalization of Grange-sponsored insurance companies.

This first organization proved largely ineffectual but does seem to have provided the inspiration for the first effective Alliance group, which was established on April 15, 1880, by newspaper editor Milton George in Chicago. George&#x27;s paper, &quot;Western Rural,&quot; gave the new organization public exposure and inspired the establishment of chartered local organizations, beginning in Filley, Nebraska and soon spreading throughout the American Midwest. Dues were not collected in the earliest phase of Northern Alliance&#x27;s existence, with editor George financing the group&#x27;s launch — a fact which spurred growth. Within a month more than 200 locals had been chartered, with claims made that 1,000 local groups had been established by the end of the organization&#x27;s first year.

The Northern Alliance made its greatest inroads in areas which were stricken by drought in 1881, including the states of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. Growth was slower in states less severely affected, including as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Local organizations proved easier to launch than did statewide bodies and in its first years the Alliance was dominated by these local groups, with state-level bodies floundering. The locals did organize themselves at the state level, however, with delegates gathering in founding conventions in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan between January 1881 and the middle of 1882.
The new movement strove to protect farmers from the capitalistic and industrial powers of monopolies (such as railroads) and unsympathetic public officials. The Northern Alliance sought to enact a more equitable tax system on mortgage property, pass income tax law, abolish free travel passes to public officials, and regulate interstate commerce by Congress.

By the time of the organization&#x27;s 2nd Annual Convention, held early in October 1881, the organization claimed a membership of 24,500. A year hence, at the 3rd Convention of October 1882, some 2,000 locals and a total membership of 100,000 was claimed. This proved to be a high-water mark for the organization, however, as prosperity returned to Midwestern agriculture in 1883 and the 4th Convention was poorly attended and no convention was held at all in 1884. With work to do and money to be made, early enthusiasm in the new radical reform organization fell precipitously. Even National Secretary Milton George lost heart, publishing less and less news of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance in his newspaper&#x27;s pages. State and local organizations became moribund.

A fall of wheat and livestock prices following the harvest of 1884 reinvigorated the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and activity again exploded. In 1885 a new Alliance group was established for the Dakota Territory, where wheat reigned supreme, followed by a state organization for Colorado, as interest spread westward. New national principles were composed and mailed out to the entire readership of &quot;Western Rural&quot; and a 5th Convention was successfully held in November 1886. A system of dues was established, thereby funding and energizing the state organizations.

The program of the organization became steadily more radical in this interval, including demands for government ownership of one or more of the intercontinental railroad lines as well as for unlimited coinage of silver at its historic ratio to gold. Connections began to be forged with the Knights of Labor, the leading industrial trade union organization of the day. Ten state organizations were fully functioning by 1890 and new members flooded into the Farmers&#x27; Alliance at the rate of 1,000 per week. Kansas alone boasted 130,000 members, closely followed by Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, and the national office optimistically projected 2 million members in the near future.

The idea emerged to put this enthusiastic and growing membership to work to advance the group&#x27;s goals through a political organization.

===The Southern Alliance===
The roots of the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Industrial Union, commonly known as the &quot;Southern Alliance,&quot; dated back to approximately 1875, when a group of ranchers in Lampasas County, Texas organized as a Texas Alliance as a means of cooperating to apprehend horse thieves, round up stray animals, and cooperatively purchase large stores of supplies. This group gradually moved into more extensive action in response to the perceived abuses towards smaller operators engaged in by land speculators and massive cattle operations. The organization grew and was organized on a statewide basis in 1878 but was almost immediately killed when it attempted to enter the political field and was torn asunder by antagonistic factions favoring the Democratic and Greenback parties.

In 1879 the influence of the Northern Alliance made itself felt in Parker County, Texas when a new group was established there by a former member of the Lampasas County Alliance group. The Northern Alliance&#x27;s constitution and its precedent of non-partisan activity were closely followed and in short order a dozen local groups had been established upon that model. This Texas group was incorporated in 1880 as the &quot;Farmers&#x27; State Alliance&quot; and it subsequently expanded throughout the Central and Northern parts of the state and into the neighboring Indian Territory (today&#x27;s Oklahoma). By the end of 1885 this growing organization claimed a membership of approximately 50,000, scattered between more than 1200 local groups, known as &quot;Sub-Alliances.&quot;

During the early 1880s this Texas Farmers&#x27; State Alliance was considered to be a loose part of the Northern Alliance organization. Owing to the lack of dues of the national group in this period, such a relationship was more theoretical than practical. The adoption of a dues system in the middle part of the decade forced the Texas group to closely consider its organizational affiliation.

Charles W. Macune, the son of a Methodist preacher, emerged as the leader of this Texas organization when he was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Texas organization in 1886. Macune immediately stifled an impending split of the organization threatened by a faction inside the Texas Alliance pushing to launch the group as an independent political party. He then united the group around a vision of organizational independence from the Northern Alliance coupled with a program of active expansion. As a first step towards this end, Macune negotiated a merger with the Louisiana Farmers&#x27; Union, a group established in 1880 and transformed into a secret society in 1885. The groups were joined under a new name, the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Cooperative Union of America.

This was one of the first steps in unifying farmers along the American cotton belt. The demands of the Southern Alliance were similar to those of its northern counterpart. They pressed for abolition of national banks and monopolies, free coinage of silver, issuance of paper money (Greenback or Fiat money), loans on land, establishment of sub-treasuries, income tax acts, and revision of tariffs.

In 1889 the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Cooperative Union united with a large rival organization known as the Agricultural Wheel to form a new group called the National Farmers&#x27; and Laborers&#x27; Union of America. Negotiations were begun to further unify forces by joining this newly expanded Southern Alliance with its Northern Alliance counterpart. While merger of the two organizations would have created a larger and more powerful organization, unity was stalled over terms of the union, including the composition of the governing bodies, divergent views on non-white membership, and disagreement over program owing to divergence between Southern and Northern farmers&#x27; economic interests.

At its December 1889 convention in St. Louis, the National Farmers&#x27; and Laborers&#x27; Union of America changed its name again, this time to the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Industrial Union — the name by which it would be known for the rest of its existence.

The Southern Farmers&#x27; Alliance was unapologetic about its color bar banning black farmers from membership. The Alliance&#x27;s National Secretary-Treasurer J.H. Turner, himself the son of a former slave-owner, wrote that in fact the liberated slaves&#x27; &quot;worst enemies&quot; had been the Northern carpetbaggers of the Reconstruction era, who &quot;promised each head of family forty acres of land and a mule if only he would vote right.&quot;

Moreover, Turner noted, the liberated slaves of the South had been promised &quot;social equality with the whites, and a great many other things which, since he has found out better, he neither needs nor wants.&quot; Turner argued that relations between the races were fundamentally benevolent now that black farmers had recognized that &quot;his old master&quot; had &quot;almost invariably&quot; been on hand to provide &quot;the best advice&quot; regarding agricultural problems and had very often been the one to &quot;protect and defend him in his business affairs.&quot;

Such a view of the indebted and impoverished black sharecroppers of the South, also typical of Southern whites of the era, did nothing to reassure African-American farmers that their concerns were shared by their European-American counterparts. With their presence from the Southern Farmers&#x27; Alliance barred due to racism, African-American farmers were forced to establish an organization of their own.

In December 1886 a group of black farmers organized themselves in Houston County, Texas as the Alliance of Colored Farmers of Texas — forerunner of the Colored Farmers&#x27; National Alliance and Cooperative Union, commonly known as the &quot;Colored Farmers&#x27; Alliance.&quot; A declaration of principles was adopted which identified the new organization as a mutual aid society dedicated to education, improvement of agricultural efficiency, and the raising of funds for collective benefits for &quot;sick or disabled members, or their distressed families.&quot; The initial form of the organization was that of a secret society.

In February 1887 the group was chartered under the laws of Texas as the Alliance of Colored Farmers. This was followed by a convention in Lovelady, Texas held on March 14, 1888, at which the group was redefined as national in scope under the name Colored Farmers&#x27; National Alliance and Cooperative Union. A national newspaper was launched by the organization called &quot;The National Alliance.&quot;

The organization rapidly spread across the American South, establishing a presence in every Southern state of the union.

The Colored Farmers&#x27; Alliance sponsored cooperative stores at which members could obtain necessary goods at reduced prices, published newspapers which attempted to educate members of the organization as to new farming techniques, and in some places raised money to help support the underfunded segregated black schools of the region.

The Colored Farmers&#x27; Alliance&#x27;s organizational strength peaked in 1891, with some 1.2 million members claimed.

== Opposition ==

The Alliance was opposed by a group called the Knights of Reciprocity, founded in Garden City, Kansas in winter of 1890 by a group of Republicans including Jesse Taylor, D. M. Frost and S. R. Peters. By 1895 the Knights claimed 125,000 members and had lodges in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Ohio. Founders included Masons, Oddfellows and Pythians. Its program included trade reciprocity, protection of American industries, just pensions for Union veterans and disenfranchisement of those who accepted or offered a bribe for a vote.

The Knights were adamant in their opposition to what they called the Democratic Union Labor - Farmers Alliance combination in politics. One of their circulars from 1891 reads:

The only way for the farmers to meet the Alliance secret political society is with a secret society the object of which shall not be to nominate men for office, but to assist in educating the people and making them thoroughly acquainted with the wants of all the people and the fallacies of the Alliance &quot;calamity&quot; howlers, who are traveling from State to State, county to county, town to town, township to township, schoolhouse to schoolhouse, not for the good of the people, but for the money they make and in hopes of political promotion. The people should organize at once in opposition to this gigantic scheme.

==Agenda and achievements==

As a widespread movement consisting of three independent branches and existing for more than two decades, reduction of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance to a few universal objectives is problematic. As Southern Alliance leader C.W. Macune noted in 1891, the agenda of the organization was both amorphous and dynamic, a response to local problems and conditions:

Included among these concerns to greater or lesser extent were the question of exploitative terms of credit, insufficient money supply to sustain the economic needs of society, super-profits extracted by merchants, millers, and other middlemen, systemically unfavorable terms of trade levied upon small-scale agricultural shippers by the railroad industry, negative impacts on land prices caused by speculation.

The accomplishments of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance are numerous. For example, many Alliance chapters all set up their own cooperative stores, which bought directly from wholesalers and sold their goods to farmers at a lower rate, at times 20 to 30 percent below the regular retail price. Such stores achieved only limited success, however, since they faced the hostility of wholesale merchants who sometimes retaliated by temporarily lowering their prices in order to drive the Alliance stores out of business.

Additionally, the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance established its own mills for flour, cottonseed oil, and corn, as well as its own cotton gin. Such facilities allowed debt-laden farmers, who often had little cash to pay third-party mills, to bring their goods to markets at a lower cost.

=== The national agenda ===

The limited effects of the local policies of the Alliance did little to address the overall problem of deflation and depressed agricultural prices. By 1886, tensions had begun to form in the movement between the political activists, who promoted a national political agenda, and the political conservatives, who favored no change in national policy but a &quot;strictly business&quot; plan of local economic action. In Texas, the split reached a climax in August 1886 at the statewide convention in Cleburne. The political activists successfully lobbied for passage of a set of political demands that included support of the Knights of Labor and the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886. Other demands include changes in governmental land policy, and railroad regulation. The demands also included a demand for use of silver as legal tender, on the grounds that this would alleviate the contraction in the money supply that led to falling prices and scarcity of credit (see gold standard).

The Alliance wanted to change the way Americans worked by pushing for an eight-hour workday. It did away with national banks so private, local banks could be formed. The Alliance wanted an income tax, the freedom to coin its own money and the freedom to borrow money from the government to buy land. The Alliance also tried to do away with foreign competitors who owned land in America. It wanted to directly elect federal judges and senators. The Alliance gained powerful political strength and controlled elections in states in the South and the West.

In the South, the agenda centered on demands of government control of transportation and communication, in order to break the power of corporate monopolies. From 1890 it also included a demand for a national &quot;Sub-Treasury Plan&quot; calling for the establishment of a network of government-owned warehouses for the storage of non-perishable agricultural commodities, operated at minimal cost to participating farmers. Farmers would then be permitted to draw low interest loans of up to 80% of the value of warehoused goods, payable in U.S. Treasury notes, under the plan. The failure of the Democratic Party to endorse this initiative was instrumental in causing the Farmers&#x27; Alliance to become directly involved in partisan politics through an organization largely of its own making, the People&#x27;s Party.

The Southern Alliance also demanded reforms of currency, land ownership, and income tax policies. Meanwhile, the Northern Alliance stressed the demand for free coinage of large amounts of silver.

Political activists in the movement also made attempts to unite the two Alliance organizations, along with the Knights of Labor and the Colored Farmers&#x27; National Alliance and Cooperative Union, into a common movement. The efforts and unification proved futile, however.

=== Transition to the Populist movement ===

As an economic movement, the Alliance had a very limited and short term success. Cotton brokers who had previously negotiated with individual farmers for ten bales at a time now needed to strike deals with the Alliance men for 1,000 bale sales. This solidarity was usually short-lived, however, and could not withstand the retaliation from the commodities brokers and railroads, who responded by boycotting the Alliance and eventually broke the power of the movement. The Alliance had never fielded its own political candidates. It preferred to work through the established Republican Party in the Midwest and Democratic Party in the South — although these often proved fickle in supporting the agenda of the Alliance.

The Alliance failed as an economic movement, but it is regarded by historians as engendering a &quot;movement culture&quot; among the rural poor. This failure prompted an evolution of the Alliance into a political movement to field its own candidates in national elections. In 1889–1890, the Alliance was reborn as the People&#x27;s Party (commonly known as the &quot;Populists&quot;), and included both Alliance men and Knights of Labor members from the industrialized Northeast. The Populists, who fielded national candidates in the 1892 election, essentially repeated all the demands of the Alliance in its platform.

<text>Maleagant (alternately &quot;Malagant&quot;, &quot;Meleagan&quot;, &quot;Meleagant&quot;, &quot;Meliagant&quot;, &quot;Meliagaunt&quot;, &quot;Meliagant&quot;, &quot;Meliaganz&quot;, &quot;Meliagrance&quot;, &quot;Meliagrant&quot;, &quot;Mellegrans&quot;, &quot;Mellyagraunce&quot;) is a villain from Arthurian legend. In a number of versions of a popular episode, Maleagant abducts King Arthur’s wife, Queen Guinevere, necessitating her rescue by Arthur and his knights. The earliest surviving version of this episode names the abductor Melwas; as Maleagant, he debuts as Lancelot&#x27;s archenemy in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; French romance &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;. However, all surviving versions seem to be later adaptations of a stock narrative of significantly earlier provenance.

==Melwas==
The earliest version of the popular abduction-of-Guinevere motif appears in the early 12th-century Latin &quot;Life of Gildas&quot; by Caradoc of Llancarfan. In that text, Melwas, king of the &quot;Summer Country&quot; (&quot;regnante in aestiua regione&quot;; a direct translation of the Old Welsh name for Somerset, Gwlad yr Haf), carries Guinevere (Gwenhwyfar) off to his stronghold of Glastonbury. Arthur locates her after a year of searching and prepares to storm the castle, but Gildas negotiates her safe return. Melwas also appears in a fragmentary Welsh dialogue, indicating that this story was widely known in Wales. An early 12th-century monumental carving on the archivolt of Modena Cathedral in Italy contains a related scene, in which Arthur and his warriors besiege a castle where a character identified as Mardoc sits with Winlogee, presumably Guinevere.

Roger Sherman Loomis regarded the form Maleagant or Meleagans as directly derivative of the Brythonic Melwas. He listed a number of variants, including &quot;Mehaloas&quot;, &quot;Melians&quot; and &quot;Malvasius&quot;.

==Maleagant==
Maleagant (spelled &quot;Meliagant&quot; or &quot;Meliaganz&quot;) first appears under that name in &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot; by Chrétien de Troyes, where he is said to be the son of King Bagdemagus, ruler of the otherworldly realm of Gorre (the Land of No Return), and brings the abducted Guinevere to his impenetrable castle out of his one-sided love for Arthur&#x27;s wife. The queen is rescued by Lancelot and Gawain; this is the first major appearance of Lancelot in Arthurian legend. In this story, Maleagant has multiple sisters, one of whom betrays him to save an imprisoned Lancelot, who had earlier helped her by beheading her enemy.

Maleagant&#x27;s role seems to have diminished as Mordred became more popular. Nevertheless, he has continued to appear in most accounts of Guinevere&#x27;s kidnapping. Notably, he plays that part in the Lancelot-Grail cycle and consequently in Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. In Malory&#x27;s telling, Maleagant kidnaps Guinevere and her unarmed knights and holds them prisoner in his castle. After Maleagant&#x27;s archers kill his horse, Lancelot has to ride to the castle in a cart in order to save the queen. Knowing Lancelot was on his way, Maleagant pleads to Guinevere for mercy, which she grants and then forces Lancelot to stifle his rage against Maleagant. Later, Maleagant learns of Guinevere&#x27;s unfaithfulness to Arthur and is willing to fight in a duel at Arthur&#x27;s court in an attempt to prove it to others. After Guinevere made it known that she wants Maleagant dead, Lancelot kills him even though Maleagant begs for mercy. However, this happens only after Maleagant agreed to continue fighting with Lancelot&#x27;s helmet removed, his left side body armour removed, and his left hand tied behind his back (Lancelot felt it necessary to finish the bout, but would not slay Maleagant unless Maleagant agreed to continue fighting).

In the romance &quot;Sone de Nansai&quot;, the hero Sone visits an island said to have been Meleagan&#x27;s, whose father was Baudemagus; his grandfather was named Tadus. Meleagan&#x27;s island is perfectly square and its walls are made of crystal; there is a palace at each corner and a fountain wells up through a gilded copper horn at the center. The Sword Bridge connects the island to a causeway, a bowshot away, which leads to the mainland. In Meleagan&#x27;s day, many men were beheaded there.

==Modern fiction==
Maleagant appears in modern retellings like Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; and T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (as Sir Meliagrance).
* In the aftermath of the desperate battle at the end of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, the protagonist, time traveling American Hank Morgan, tries to help the severely wounded Sir Maleagant, but is stabbed by him. 
*In &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot; novels by English author Bernard Cornwell, based on the Arthurian legend, a secondary character named Melwas is mentioned many times, here as the king of the tribe of the Belgae, who inhabited the region roughly corresponding to modern Hampshire with its capital at Venta Belgarum (modern Winchester). At first glance, the only similarity between the legendary character and the fictional one seems to be their common name, but, upon closer inspection, we find some clues that indicate a possible intention of the author of having his fictional Melwas to be his own peculiar version of Maleagant. A couple of similarities include the fact that, in the novels, Melwas is a vassal to King Uther Pendragon (Arthur&#x27;s father) and, after his death, to his grandson, the child King Mordred, to whom Arthur serves as Regent during his minority, while Maleagant himself was a vassal to King Arthur. Both became members of the Round Table in its respective versions in the novels and in the Arthurian legend, and both betrayed their sovereigns by raising arms against them.
*In the French TV series &quot;Kaamelott&quot;, Meleagant is a dark and mysterious entity, either a god or a wizard, portrayed by Carlo Brandt. He seems omniscient, able to predict the future and appear in people&#x27;s dreams. His goal seems to push Lancelot to explore the darkest sides of his personality. Meleagant also pushes King Arthur and the Roman Emperor to commit suicide. While Caesar dies, Arthur survives his suicide attempt. However, as Arthur is on his death bed, he handles the power to Lancelot, still under Meleagant&#x27;s influence. Manipulating the knight, Meleagant pushes Lancelot to establish a dictatorship over the Kingdom of Logres, while Arthur flees, with the help of the smuggler Venec, to Rome. 
*He appears in the 1995 film &quot;First Knight&quot; as a murderous renegade knight of the Round Table, portrayed by Ben Cross.
*Melwas appears in Giles Kristian’s novel &quot;Lancelot&quot; as an antagonist of the title character from boyhood.

<text>Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer (Berber: &quot;Tassili n Ajjer&quot;, ; &quot;Plateau of rivers&quot;) is a mountain range in the Sahara desert, located in south-eastern Algeria. It holds one of the most important groupings of prehistoric cave art in the world, and covers an area of more than ,

The site has been designated a national park and a Biosphere Reserve, and was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1982.

The literal English translation of &quot;Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer&quot; is &#x27;plateau of rivers&#x27;.
==Geography==
Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer is a plateau in south-eastern Algeria at the borders of Libya and Nigeri, covering an area of 72,000 km2. It ranges from east-south-east to . Its highest point is the Adrar Afao that peaks at , located at . The nearest town is Djanet, about to the south-west.

The plateau is of great geological and aesthetic interest. Its panorama of geological formations of rock forests, composed of eroded sandstone, resembles a lunar landscape and hosts a range of rock art styles.

===Geology===
The range is composed largely of sandstone. The sandstone is stained by a thin outer layer of deposited metallic oxides that colour the rock formations variously from near-black to dull red. Erosion in the area has resulted in nearly 300 natural rock arches being formed in the south east, along with deep gorges and permanent water pools in the north.

===Ecology===
Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer lies within the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion. Due to the higher elevation of the area, coupled with the water-retentive properties of the sandstone, the vegetation here is somewhat more lush and verdant than in the lower regions of desert; in turn, this creates an attractive habitat for numerous animal species, from the smallest invertebrates, up the food chain to mammals. The park features an open woodland, primarily consisting of the endangered and endemic Saharan cypress and Saharan myrtle, in its higher-elevation eastern half. The Tassili cypress is one of the longest-living trees and organisms on Earth, after the bristlecone pines of the Western US.

An isolated population of the West African crocodile survived in Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer until the twentieth century; today, the species is primarily found in more tropical and sub-Saharan regions of Western and Central Africa, from Senegal to Chad. The aoudad, or Barbary sheep, is the only extant species of animal depicted in the area&#x27;s ancient rock artwork.

The park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of spotted, crowned and Lichtenstein&#x27;s sandgrouse, Pharaoh eagle-owls, greater hoopoe-larks, bar-tailed and desert larks, pale rock martins, fulvous babblers, white-crowned and mourning wheatears, desert sparrows and trumpeter finches.

== Archaeology ==
=== Background ===
Algerian rock art has been subject to European study since 1863, with surveys conducted by &quot;A. Pomel (1893–1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901–1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892–1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931–1957), L. Joleaud (1918–1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935–1955).&quot;

Tassili was already well known by the early 20th century, but Westerners were broadly introduced to it through a series of sketches made by French legionnaires, particularly Lieutenant Charles Brenans in the 1930s. He brought with him French archaeologist Henri Lhote, who would later return during 1956–1957, 1959, 1962, and 1970. Lhote&#x27;s expeditions have been heavily criticized, with his team accused of faking images and of damaging paintings in brightening them for tracing and photography, which resulted in reducing the original colors beyond repair.

=== Current archaeological interpretation ===
The site of Tassili was primarily occupied during the Neolithic period by transhumant pastoralist groups whose lifestyle benefited both humans and livestock. The local geography, elevation, and natural resources were optimal conditions for dry-season camping of small groups. The wadis within the mountain range functioned as corridors between the rocky highlands and the sandy lowlands. The highlands have archaeological evidence of occupation dating from 5500 to 1500 BCE, while the lowlands have stone tumuli and hearths dating between 6000 and 4000 BCE. The lowland locations appear to have been used as living sites, specifically during the rainy season. There are numerous rock shelters within the sandstone forests, strewn with Neolithic artifacts including ceramic pots and potsherds, lithic arrowheads, bowls and grinders, beads, and jewelry.

The transition to pastoralism following the African Humid period during the early Holocene is reflected in Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer&#x27;s archaeological material record, rock art, and zooarchaeology. Further, the occupation of Tassili is part of a larger movement and climate shift within the Central Sahara. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironment studies started in the Central Sahara around 14,000 BP and then proceeded by an arid period that resulted in narrow ecological niches. However, the climate was not consistent and the Sahara was split between the arid lowlands and the humid highlands. Archaeological excavations confirm that human occupation, in the form of hunter-gather groups, occurred between 10,000 and 7500 BP; following 7500 BP, humans began to organize into pastoral groups in response to the increasingly unpredictable climate. There was a dry period from 7900 and 7200 BP in Tassili that preceded the appearance of the first pastoral groups, which is consistent with other parts of the Saharan-Sahelian belt. The pre-Pastoral pottery excavated from Tassili dates around 9,000–8,500 BP, while the Pastoral pottery is from 7100–6000 BP.

The rock art at Tassili is used in conjunction with other sites, including Dhar Tichitt in Mauritania, to study the development of animal husbandry and trans-Saharan travel in North Africa. Cattle were herded across vast areas as early as 3000–2000 BCE, reflecting the origins and spread of pastoralism in the area. This was followed by horses (before 1000 BCE) and then the camel in the next millennium. The arrival of camels reflects the increased development of trans-Saharan trade, as camels were primarily used as transport in trade caravans.

===Prehistoric art===
The rock formation is an archaeological site, noted for its numerous prehistoric parietal works of rock art, first reported in 1910, that date to the early Neolithic era at the end of the last glacial period during which the Sahara was a habitable savanna rather than the current desert. Although sources vary considerably, the earliest pieces of art are presumed to be 12,000 years old. The vast majority date to the ninth and tenth millennia BP or younger, according to OSL dating of associated sediments. The art was dated by gathering small fragments of the painted panels that had dried out and flaked off before being buried. Among the 15,000 engravings so far identified, the subjects depicted are large wild animals including antelopes and crocodiles, cattle herds, and humans who engage in activities such as hunting and dancing. These paintings are some of the earliest by Central Saharan artists, and occur in the largest concentration at Tassili. Although Algeria is relatively close to the Iberian Peninsula, the rock art of Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer evolved separately from that of the European tradition. According to UNESCO, &quot;The exceptional density of paintings and engravings...have made &quot;Tassili&quot; world famous.&quot;

Similar to other Saharan sites with rock art, Tassili can be separated into five distinct traditions: Archaic (10,000 to 7500 BCE), Round Head (7550 to 5050 BCE), Bovidian or Pastoral (4500 to 4000 BCE), Horse (from 2000 BCE and 50 CE), and Camel (1000 BCE and onward).

The Archaic period consists primarily of wild animals that lived in the Sahara during the Early Holocene. These works are attributed to hunter-gather peoples, consisting of only etchings. Images are primarily of larger animals, depicted in a naturalistic manner, with the occasional geometric pattern and the human figure. Usually, the humans and animals are depicted within the context of a hunting scene.

The Round Head Period is associated with specific stylistic choices depicting humanoid forms and is well separated from the Archaic tradition even though hunter-gatherers were the artists for both. The art consists mainly of paintings, with some of the oldest and largest exposed rock paintings in Africa; one human figure stands over five meters and another at three and a half meters. The unique depiction of floating figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies appear to be floating on the rock surface, hence the &quot;Round Head&quot; label. The occurrence of these paintings and motifs are concentrated in specific locations on the plateau, implying that these sites were the center of ritual, rites, and ceremonies. Most animals shown are mouflon and antelope, usually in static positions that do not appear to be part of a hunting scene.

The Bovidian/Pastoral period correlates with the arrival of domesticated cattle into the Sahara and the gradual shift to mobile pastoralism. There is a notable and visual difference between the Pastoral period and the earlier two periods, coinciding with the aridification of the Sahara. There is increased stylistic variation, implying the movement of different cultural groups within the area. Domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs are depicted, paralleling the zooarchaeological record of the area. The scenes reference diversified communities of herders, hunters with bows, as well as women and children, and imply a growing stratification of society based on property.

The following Horse traditions correspond with the complete desertification of the Sahara and the requirement for new travel methods. The arrival of horses, horse-drawn chariots, and riders are depicted, often in mid-gallop, and is associated more with hunting than warfare. Inscriptions of Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, appear next to the images, however, the text is completely indecipherable.

The last period is defined by the appearance of camels, which replaced donkeys and cattle as the main mode of transportation across the Sahara. The arrival of camels coincides with the development of long-distance trade routes used by caravans to transport salt, goods, and enslaved people across the Sahara. Men, both mounted and unmounted, with shields, spears, and swords are present. Animals including cows and goats are included, but wild animals were crudely rendered.

Although these periods are successive the timeframes are flexible and are consistently being reconstructed by archaeologists as technology and interpretation develop. The art had been dated by archaeologists who gathered fallen fragments and debris from the rock face.

A notable piece common in academic writing is the &quot;Running Horned Woman,&quot; also known as the &quot;Horned Goddess,&quot; from the round head period. The image depicts a female figure with horns in midstride; dots adorn her torso and limbs, and she is dressed in fringed armbands, a skirt, leg bands, and anklets. According to Arisika Razak, Tassili&#x27;s Horned Goddess is an early example of the &quot;African Sacred Feminine.&quot; Her femininity, fertility, and connection to nature are emphasized while the Neolithic artist superimposes the figure onto smaller, older figures. The use of bull horns is a common theme in later round head paintings, which reflects the steady integration of domesticated cattle into Saharan daily life. Cattle imagery, specifically that of bulls, became a central theme in not only at Tassili, but at other nearby sites in Libya.

===Fungoid rock art===
In 1989, the psychedelics researcher Giorgio Samorini proposed the theory that the fungoid-like paintings in the caves of Tassili are proof of the relationship between humans and psychedelics in the ancient populations of the Sahara, when it was still a verdant land:

This theory was reused by Terence McKenna in his 1992 book &quot;Food of the Gods&quot;, hypothesizing that the Neolithic culture that inhabited the site used psilocybin mushrooms as part of its religious ritual life, citing rock paintings showing persons holding mushroom-like objects in their hands, as well as mushrooms growing from their bodies. For Henri Lhote, who discovered the Tassili caves in the late 1950s, these were obviously secret sanctuaries.

The painting that best supports the mushroom hypothesis is the &quot;Tassili mushroom figure Matalem-Amazar&quot; where the body of the represented shaman is covered with mushrooms. According to Earl Lee in his book &quot;From the Bodies of the Gods: Psychoactive Plants and the Cults of the Dead&quot; (2012), this imagery refers to an ancient episode where a &quot;mushroom shaman&quot; was buried while fully clothed and when unearthed sometime later, tiny mushrooms would be growing on the clothes. Earl Lee considered the mushroom paintings at Tassili fairly realistic.

According to Brian Akers, writer for the &quot;Mushroom&quot; journal, the fungoid rock art in Tassili does not resemble the representations of the &quot;Psilocybe hispanica&quot; in the Selva Pascuala caves (2015), and he doesn&#x27;t consider it realistic.

<doc id="1184687" wikidata="Q3518511" url="?curid=1184687" title="Referendums in Italy">
<text>A referendum, in the Italian legal system is a request directed to the whole electorate to express their view on a determined question. It is the main instrument of direct democracy in Italy.

The Constitution of Italy only provides for four types of legally binding referendums:
*A popular referendum, in which the electorate is called to vote on whether they wish to abolish (abrogate) an existing law, either totally or partially.
*A constitutional referendum, which can be requested in some cases when a new constitutional law is approved by Parliament. Similarly, a referendum can be requested to confirm the adoption of the Statute of ordinary regions.
*An advisory referendum is required to approve the modification of regions, provinces, or municipalities.
*A popular referendum on regional laws and regulations may be regulated by regional statutes.

Despite that the constitutional right to hold a popular referendum has existed since adoption of the Constitution in 1948, the necessary legislation detailing the bureaucratic procedures needed to hold them was not adopted until the early 1970s. As a consequence of this, Italy&#x27;s first popular referendum was not held until 1974, 27 years after the constitution was first approved.

==Popular referendums==

===Requirements===
A popular referendum can only be called only at the request of five Regional Councils or 500,000 Italian voters. A popular referendum can only be asked to abolish an existing law (or part of it); a referendum to adopt new legislation is not provided for by the Constitution. Some matters are not subject to popular referendum: tax laws, budget laws, amnesties and pardons, and laws that authorize the ratification of international treaties. While these are the limits expressly stated by the Constitution, the Constitutional Court has identified further limitations.

The petition, which must include the question of the referendum, must be deposited at the Court of Cassation, which is called to examine the validity of the petition. The Constitutional Court of Italy verifies the regularity of signatures (in case the referendum was requested by the voters) and of the question of the referendum. The court has the power to reject it outright. Many fully valid petitions with the necessary 500,000 signatures have never been accepted as referendums precisely for this reason.

If the Court of Cassation judges the petition to be valid, the referendum question must then be evaluated by the Constitutional Court, which is called to judge its admissibility. Unlike the Court of Cassation, which considers the conformity of the petition to ordinary law, the reference for the Constitutional Court&#x27;s judgment is the Constitution.

If the Constitutional Court deems the referendum admissible, the President of the Republic has to set a date for the vote between April 15 and June 15.

The final hurdle is that the result of the legislative referendum is only valid if at least a majority of all eligible voters go to the polling station and cast their ballot. If this quorum is not met, the referendum is invalid (which, in practice, means the law is not abolished).

==== Electronic signatures ====
The 2021 Italian budget law authorized for the collection of electronic signatures through a government run online platform, managed through the Italian online digital ID system SPID. Although the platform is not online, starting on July 1 2021 citizens have been able to add signatures to referendums through a provisional process.

The new process has been noted for the speed at which it can collect signatures for referendums, with a referendum to decriminalize marijuana collecting 330,000 signatures in three days in due in large part to digital signatures.

===Political party use===
The political party in Italy that is most closely associated with, and has made most use of, referendums in the last 40 years is the Radical Party led by Marco Pannella. They hold the record for most referendums presented. Despite only receiving around 2.5% of the popular vote in most national elections, the numerous referendums they have proposed over the years have often mobilised the entire Italian political spectrum in support or opposition. They will often use unconventional methods such as prolonged hunger strikes and/or thirst strikes by their leaders to draw attention to their cause. Their largest political battles came in the 1970s and 80&#x27;s when they successfully campaigned for the right to divorce and the right to abortion.

Other groups have also made use of referendums to raise the profile of their own small political parties or their leaders or to raise awareness of their respective political agendas. Signatures for referendums have been collected by parties across the political spectrum from the Northern League opposing a law on immigration in 1998 (this was ruled as inadmissible by the constitutional court when presented), all the way to the Italy of Values party when leader Antonio Di Pietro collected signatures in 1998 for a change in the electoral law to a full first past the post system. The Italian radical party and the right wing National Alliance were also collecting signatures for the same exact petition on electoral reform at the same time as Di Pietro&#x27;s party, showing that often parties from vastly different political beliefs will agree on the same themes that they feel should be subject to referendums.

However, often political parties who are even in the same coalition will have very diverse opinions with regard to referendums. A notorious example of this came in 1999 when the right-wing National Alliance, led by Gianfranco Fini, was collecting signatures for two referendums to abolish political party state financing and a change in electoral law to a full first past the post system, while the Italian Radicals and Di Pietro&#x27;s Italy of Values were also collecting signatures at the same time. Despite spending an enormous amount of manpower and party funds across all of Italy, his main partner in the House of Freedoms coalition, Forza Italia, led by former and soon to be Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, offered no political or financial support. When voting for the referendums took place in 2000, Berlusconi almost abstained and said the vote was &quot;mostly pointless&quot; as he would take care of all reforms when he would return to power.

When the House of Liberties coalition returned to power in 2001, Berlusconi did not abolish political party financing and even reintroduced proportional representation into the electoral law. Critics pointed out that these new measures, approved even with the parliamentary votes of Alleanza Nazionale itself, were proof that Fini and his party had made a complete volte-face and abandoned some of their core political reforms in order to stay in power. It was also seen as proof that Fini&#x27;s influence in the coalition was not as strong as many were led to believe.

A constitutional referendum can be requested by 500,000 voters, five regional councils, or one-fifth of the members of a house of parliament when Parliament adopts a constitutional law (including a law to amend the constitution) with an absolute majority in the second vote, but without meeting a two-thirds qualified majority in each house. The referendum must be requested within three months from the publication of the bill in the Official Gazette.

Unlike a popular referendum, a constitutional referendum is confirmatory. This means a &quot;Yes&quot; vote is a vote in support of the constitutional law, whereas a &quot;Yes&quot; in a popular referendum is a vote for abolishing the law. Also unlike popular referendums, constitutional referendums are not subject to a quorum, meaning they are valid regardless of the turnout.

Italy has had four constitutional referendums in the history of the republic; two of which the constitutional law was approved in 2001 and 2020, and two in which it was rejected in 2006 and 2016.

==Ad hoc referendums==
Before the adoption of the Constitution of 1948, a unique referendum (called referendum on the institutional form of the State or institutional referendum in Italian) was held on 2 June 1946, Italians were asked to vote on the future form of government of Italy: retain the monarchy or become a republic. The republic vote won 54.3% to 45.7%.

A special advisory referendum was held in 1989, on the question of transforming the European Communities into a European Union and of allowing the European Parliament to draft a European Constitution. This referendum was made possible by Constitutional Law no. 2 of 3 April 1989, which specifically provided for this referendum to be held.

==List of referendums==
Overall, Italians have been called on to decide on 72 national referendums: 67 popular referendums, 3 constitutional referendums, and the 2 ad hoc referendums described above. They approved 25 of them, rejected 18, and 28 were declared invalid because of low turnout.

<text>Orlando Hubbs (February 18, 1840 – December 5, 1930) was an American carriage builder, ship&#x27;s joiner and politician. He moved from New York to North Carolina in 1865, where he helped organize the Republican Party in the state. He served as a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1881 and 1883.

==Early life and education==
Born in Commack, New York on Long Island, Hubbs attended local schools. He moved to Northport, New York in 1856 and learned the trade of a carriage and wagon builder. He subsequently became employed as a ship’s joiner at Hunters Point, New York during the American Civil War.

==Political career==
In 1865, Hubbs moved to New Bern, North Carolina and became engaged in mercantile pursuits. He took an active part in organizing the Republican Party in North Carolina. 

From 1871 to 1881 Hubbs was elected as sheriff of Craven County. He ran for United States House of Representatives in 1880, an election cycle in which the GOP convention was divided over his party nomination. Curtis H. Brogden, a former congressman, emerged in the campaign as an outspoken opponent of Hubbs. However, the publicity of the factionalism dissolved during the general election campaign, where Hubbs defeated Democratic white supremacist William H. Kitchin by fifteen percentage points.

During the 47th congressional session (1881–83), Hubbs was dubbed as being one of four &quot;carpetbaggers,&quot; and worked quietly on patronage for political supporters, in addition to pursuing matters important to his district. In early January 1883, Hubbs was one of only seven House Republicans to vote against the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, legislation sponsored by Ohio Jim Crow Democrat George H. Pendleton to replace the spoils system (which Radical Republicans effectively used in the post-Civil War years to ensure civil rights for blacks) with a bloated bureaucracy controlled by Democrats to discriminate against blacks. Under immense political pressure following the assassination of President James A. Garfield, the vast majority of Stalwarts which had opposed civil service reform ultimately voted for the Pendleton Act.

In the 1882 United States House of Representatives elections, Hubbs ran for re-election, though once again faced GOP factionalism. The party&#x27;s district convention resulted in disorder and confusion, as both he and attorney James E. O&#x27;Hara claimed to be the actual party nominee for the general election. Hubbs subsequently dropped out of the race in mid-October that year, noting the disastrous consequences of the intraparty schism. O&#x27;Hara then won the general election that year to succeed Hubbs.

During the 1884 United States presidential election, Hubbs served as a presidential elector for the Republican nominee James G. Blaine, who lost the general election to Bourbon Democrat Grover Cleveland.

In 1890, he returned to New York state and Long Island, settling in Central Islip on the South Shore. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Suffolk Co., 2nd D.) in 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907 and 1908. He served in the New York Senate in 1909 and 1910.

He then lived in Smithtown until his death in 1930. His body was interred in Commack Cemetery, in his hometown of Commack.

<text>The University of Bremen () is a public university in Bremen, Germany, with approximately 18,400 students from 117 countries. Its 12 faculties offer more than 100 degree programs.

The University of Bremen has been among the top 50 European research universities for more than 50 years and focuses its research on 5 high-profile areas. It is one of 11 institutions which were successful in the category &quot;Institutional Strategies&quot; of the Excellence Initiative launched by the Federal Government and the Federal States in 2012. The university was also successful in the categories &quot;Graduate Schools&quot; and &quot;Clusters of Excellence&quot; of the initiative.

Some of the paths that were taken in the early days of the university, also referred to as the &quot;Bremen model&quot;, have since become characteristics of modern universities, such as interdisciplinary, explorative learning, social relevance to practice-oriented project studies which enjoy a high reputation in the academic world as well as in business and industry.

==History==

Though Bremen became a university city only recently, higher education in Bremen has a long tradition. The Bremen Latin School was upgraded to &quot;Gymnasium Academicum&quot; in 1584. In 1610 it was transformed into &quot;Gymnasium Illustre&quot;. Under Napoleonic rule, in 1811 the institution of a &quot;French-Bremen University&quot; was considered. In 1971 the University of Bremen opened its doors.

The development of the University of Bremen can be divided up into steps of 10 to 12 years – first foundation, then restructuring, consolidation and profile building. At the beginning of the 1970s, the university was set up as a &quot;science complex&quot; in a city oriented towards trade and seafaring that had no experience with academia, particularly not with leftist professors. University, business and the public in the region did not move closer together until the 1980s, through the foundation of the natural science and engineering departments, co-operation with the newly founded Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven (1980), as well as the development of the co-located technology park (from 1988). Other important factors were the initial success in setting up collaborative research centres and in the acquisition of considerable of external funds. The mathematics professor Jürgen Timm, elected university rector in 1982, was largely responsible for this turnaround.

As a consequence, the University of Bremen improved in research rankings, gained national recognition, and established a number of endowment professorships. Research excellence and its interdisciplinary profile is reflected in the establishment of numerous research centers and programs funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). These currently include eight collaborative research centers and the Research Center of Ocean Margins, one of only six national research centers of the DFG.

From 1996 until 2001 the University of Bremen (along with six other universities in Germany) participated in a pilot scheme for structural reform of university administration, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. This project improved the co-operation and communication between the university&#x27;s administration, teaching and research units. With the realization of the &quot;Laptop University&quot; project, the university became a leading university in the field of digital media education in Germany.

By 2000, after an organisational development process of three years in which the university set goals for the development of its profile, this trend was continued with the promotion of junior scientists in structured graduate programs, and staff development programs for the great number of early-stage researchers entering the university as junior professors. In teaching, there are comprehensive evaluations, more specific admission requirements, and improved completion rates for Bachelors and master&#x27;s degrees.

Bremen was rewarded with the title &quot;Stadt der Wissenschaft 2005&quot; (City of Science of 2005), which science, politics, business and culture won jointly for Bremen and Bremerhaven, by the Foundation for German Science (Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft). 

In 2012, the University of Bremen became one of 11 institutions, which were successful in the category &quot;Institutional Strategies&quot; of the Excellence Initiative launched by the Federal Government and the Federal States. With the Cluster of Excellence “The Ocean Floor – Earth’s Uncharted Interface” of MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, the University of Bremen is still part of the German Excellence Strategy and will receive funding from 2019 – 2025. In the current call for proposals, the University of Bremen is once again participating in the excellence strategy competition. 

In 2020, the university had more DFG Collaborative Research Centers than ever and is regarded the science hub of Northwest Germany. Since the foundation of the Bremen Technology Park in 1988, many research institutes and facilities have settled near the University of Bremen campus. These include the Bremen Innovation and Technology Centre (BITZ), the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM), the Bremen Institute for Production and Logistics GmbH (BIBA), the Institute of Shipping Economics and Logistics (ISL), the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM, MARUM – Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology – BIPS GmbH (BIPS), Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT), Leibniz Institute for Materials Engineering (IWT), the German Aerospace Center Bremen (DLR), the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), MAPEX Center for Materials and Processes, the Centre for Media, Communication and Information Research (ZeMKI), the Data Science Center, Digital Hub Industry (DHI), and the “MaTeNa innovate! Center” for accelerated technology transfer.

<text>Noni juice is derived from the fruit of the &quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; tree indigenous to Southeast Asia and Australasia. It has been promoted, illegally in several cases, as a cure for a number of human diseases. However, there is no evidence to support any claims of therapeutic benefit.

==Regulatory warnings==
===Tahitian Noni (Morinda, Inc.)===
On August 26, 1998, the Attorneys General of Arizona, California, New Jersey, and Texas announced a multi-state settlement with Morinda, Inc. following charges that the company had made &quot;unsubstantiated claims in consumer testimonials and other promotional material indicating that its Tahitian Noni juice could treat, cure or prevent numerous diseases such as diabetes, clinical depression, hemorrhoids and arthritis.&quot; Such claims rendered the beverage an unapproved new drug under state and federal food and drug laws and should not have been sold until it received approval. Under the terms of the agreement, Morinda agreed to: 
* No longer make drug claims, or claims that the product can cure, treat, or prevent any disease until &quot;Tahitian Noni&quot; is approved and cleared for those uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
* Not make any other claims, whether health claims or others, regarding the benefits of Tahitian Noni unless such claims are true and the company can substantiate the claim by reliable scientific evidence.
* Not use testimonials which imply that the advertised claimed results are the typical or ordinary experience of consumers in actual conditions of use, unless Morinda possesses and relies upon adequate substantiation that the results are typical or ordinary.

===Other===
In August 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a Warning Letter to Flora, Inc. for violating section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)]. Flora made twelve unfounded health claims about the purported benefits of noni juice as a medical product, in effect causing the juice to be evaluated as a drug. Under the Act, this necessitates all safety and clinical trial evidence for the juice providing such effects in humans.

The FDA letter also cited 1) absent scientific evidence for health benefits of the noni phytochemicals scopoletin and damnacanthal, neither of which has been confirmed with biological activity in humans, and 2) lack of scientific foundation for health claims made by two proponents of noni juice, Dr. Isabella Abbot and Dr. Ralph Heinicke. Two other FDA letters have been issued for the same types of violations.

==Toxicity==
Research has pointed to anthraquinones found in noni roots, leaves and fruit as potentially toxic to the liver and other organs. In 2005, two published clinical case reports described incidents of acute hepatitis caused by ingesting Tahitian Noni juice. These case reports were reviewed in 2006 by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which initially reported that data available at the time of the case reports were not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between consumption of the juice and hepatotoxicity; however, an increasing number of subsequent case reports suggested that some individuals may be particularly sensitive to hepatotoxic effects of noni fruit products. The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health advised against consumption of noni products if one has a history of liver disorders.

The potential for toxicity caused by noni juices remained under surveillance by EFSA, individual food safety authorities in France, Finland and Ireland, and medical investigators in Germany.

Noni products may contain high amounts of potassium, leading to one advisory that people on potassium-restricted diets because of kidney problems should avoid using noni.

==Medical claims==
Although noni plants and juices have been promoted by practitioners of alternative medicine as a cure for a number of human maladies including HIV, heart disease and cancer, the American Cancer Society concluded that &quot;there is no reliable clinical evidence that noni juice is effective in preventing or treating cancer or any other disease in humans&quot;.

<text>Richard Chelimo (21 April 1972 – 15 August 2001) was a Kenyan long-distance runner, and a world record holder over 10,000 metres. However, he is best known as the silver medallist in the controversial 10,000m at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. He was also a world junior record holder in the 10,000m.

==Family and tribe==

Chelimo, who was born in the Marakwet region of Kenya, was a member of the Kalenjin tribe (known by some as the &quot;running tribe&quot;). He came from a noted athletic family, even amongst the tribesmen, his cousin, Moses Kiptanui, was a three-time steeplechase World champion, whilst his brother, Ismael Kirui, was twice World champion over 5000 m. Richard Chelimo was married to Monica Chelimo and were blessed with 5 children.

==Athletics career==

Chelimo&#x27;s first international success was in the junior section of the 1990 world cross country championship in Aix-les-Bains, France, where he took silver. Though Chelimo received little attention due to the Kenyan domination of the event, their team won 10 successive junior titles.

However, it was not long before the athletic community took notice of Chelimo&#x27;s talent. Later that year he won the gold medal in the 10,000 m at the world junior championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Chelimo won the race by 12 seconds from his own brother, Kirui, who was only 15 at the time.

Chelimo was selected in the Kenyan senior squad for the 10,000 m at the 1991 world championships, which took place in Tokyo. As Kenya&#x27;s second runner he was assigned the task of being pacemaker to Moses Tanui. He was successful in dragging Tanui clear of his main rival, Morocco&#x27;s Khalid Skah, and on the final lap he allowed Tanui to sprint clear to take the gold medal.

The following year, at the Olympics, Chelimo met Skah again. With three laps remaining in the 10,000 m final the two athletes were clear and battling for the gold medal. At this point the pair came to lap another Moroccan athlete, Hammou Boutayeb, who stayed with the leaders even after being lapped. The rules state that a lapped runner cannot &quot;assist&quot; another runner but, although Boutayeb&#x27;s actions were interpreted as unsportsmanlike by the crowd, it was not certain that there was any collusion, that Skah gained any advantage or that Chelimo was disadvantaged. Regardless, these events incensed the Spanish crowd, and the Swedish track judge Carl-Gustav Tollemar attempted to interfere with Boutayeb&#x27;s run.

During the final 150 m Skah sprinted away from Chelimo to win the race, and was temporarily disqualified, making Chelimo the temporary Olympic champion. However, the Moroccans appealed against the disqualification and Skah was reinstated the next morning because the rule under which he was disqualified did not define a penalty.

In 1993 Chelimo broke the world junior and senior 10,000 m world record, in a time of 27:07.91 minutes, in Stockholm. He was to hold the senior world record for only five days before it was broken again by his compatriot Yobes Ondieki. He held the junior record for over 11 years before it was broken by Ugandan Boniface Kiprop Toroitich at a Golden League meeting on 3 September 2004, in a time of 27 min 04.00 s.

At the 1993 world championships in Stuttgart, Germany, Chelimo once again failed to win gold at a major championships. He managed only third place as he could not match the pace of Tanui and, a new star from Ethiopia, Haile Gebrselassie. This was another controversial race as Tanui lost a shoe after Gebreselassie stepped on his heel; the Ethiopian went on to win the race.

==Life after athletics==

Chelimo retired from athletics in 1996; according to his cousin, Kiptanui, he retired after growing despondent following his failure to rise to the very top of the sport. He returned to his old job in the army and put on a lot of weight and began to drink excessively — a decline quite similar to that of Henry Rono. However, his friends Tanui and William Mutwol encouraged him to return to training and get back into shape. Chelimo eventually got back down to within 5 kg of his racing weight. He died of a brain tumour at the age of 29.

<doc id="1184763" wikidata="Q1934479" url="?curid=1184763" title="The End...">
<text>The End... is the fourth studio album by German musician Nico, released in November 1974 through the label Island. It was recorded in summer 1974 at Sound Techniques studio in London and produced by John Cale.

== Background ==

Nico had performed two songs from the album a few years prior to the album release; &quot;Secret Side&quot; had been performed at a John Peel session for the BBC on 2 February 1971 and she had also performed &quot;You Forget to Answer&quot; on TV in France and the Netherlands in early 1972.

== Recording ==

&quot;The End...&quot; is her fifth collaboration with John Cale and second with him as producer. It carries the same harmonium-based sound heard on &quot;The Marble Index&quot; (1968) and &quot;Desertshore&quot; (1970), with the addition of Brian Eno&#x27;s synthesizers and electronic instruments.

The song &quot;You Forget to Answer&quot; tells of the misery felt by Nico when she failed to reach ex-lover, and Doors&#x27; singer, Jim Morrison by phone only to find out later that he had died. The album was her first since Morrison&#x27;s death in 1971. All but two of the songs on the album were written by Nico: the cover of the Doors&#x27; &quot;The End&quot; and a version of West Germany&#x27;s national anthem &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot;. Brian Eno plays synthesizer on &quot;It Has Not Taken Long&quot;, &quot;You Forget to Answer&quot; and &quot;Innocent and Vain&quot;.

The front and back covers feature stills from the Philippe Garrel film &quot;Les hautes solitudes&quot; (1974) in which Nico appears with Jean Seberg.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;The End...&quot; was released in November 1974, on record label Island, her only album on the label. Despite strong reviews from some publications, like its predecessors, it was not a commercial success and Nico&#x27;s partnership with Island ended.

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote (partly in a faux German accent): &quot;I don&#x27;t know &quot;vy&quot; she&#x27;s moaning about &quot;unved&quot; virgins and &quot;vether&quot; to betray her hate, and I don&#x27;t &quot;vant&quot; to know. The Manzanera-Eno-Cale settings, which I believe is what one calls this sort of elevated sound effect, are suitably morbid and exotic. But funereal irony aside, her parlay of the Doors&#x27; &#x27;The End&#x27; and the Fuehrer&#x27;s &#x27;Das Lied Der Deutschens&#x27; contextualizes both tunes more pejoratively than is intended. Nico is what happens when the bloodless wager their minds on the wisdom of the blood and the suicidal make something of their lives. If this be romanticism, give me Matthew Arnold—and gimme shelter.&quot;

<doc id="1184764" wikidata="Q901728" url="?curid=1184764" title="Spermatophore">
<text>A spermatophore () or sperm [[ampulla]] is a capsule or mass containing spermatozoa created by males of various animal species, especially salamanders and arthropods, and transferred in entirety to the female&#x27;s ovipore during reproduction. Spermatophores may additionally contain nourishment for the female, in which case it is called a nuptial gift, as in the instance of bush crickets. In the case of the toxic moth &quot;Utetheisa ornatrix&quot;, the spermatophore includes sperm, nutrients, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids which prevent predation because it is poisonous to most organisms. However, in some species such as the Edith&#x27;s checkerspot butterfly, the &quot;gift&quot; provides little nutrient value. The weight of the spermatophore transferred at mating has little effect on female reproductive output. 

==Arthropods==

Spermatophores are the norm in arachnids and several soil arthropods. In various insects, such as bush crickets, the spermatophore is often surrounded by a proteinaceous spermatophylax. The function of the spermatophylax is to cause the female to relinquish some of her control over the insemination process allowing full sperm transfer from the spermatophore. Some species of butterflies and moths also deposit a spermatophore into the female during copulation. Examples include the speckled wood butterfly or the ornate moth, where males invest up to 10% of their body mass in creating a single spermatophore. Malaysian stalk-eyed flies also deposit a spermatophore into the female during copulation, but the spermatophore is very small in size and occupies only part of the female&#x27;s vaginal capacity. This is likely an adaptation to the tendency towards high mating frequency in this species. These butterfly species have been known to use mud-puddling behavior, as demonstrated by &quot;Dryas iulia&quot;, to obtain the minerals needed in spermatophore production.

==Cephalopods==

Most cephalopods use a specialized arm called the &quot;hectocotylus&quot; to deliver spermatophores to the female. The spermatophores of the giant Pacific octopus are about a meter (or yard) long. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.
In some cephalopods, like the argonaut octopus, the arm is detachable and capable of autonomous movement and prolonged survival inside the female, to the point that it was mistaken for a parasitic worm by George Cuvier, who gave the hectocotylus (Latin: &quot;hundred&quot; &quot;hollow thing&quot;) its name. In some cases, spermatophores from multiple males might be present inside the same female simultaneously.

==Salamanders and newts==

Males of most salamander and newt species create spermatophores, which the females may choose to take up or not, depending on the success of the male&#x27;s mating display.

<doc id="1184768" wikidata="Q15223077" url="?curid=1184768" title="Harpur Trust">
<text>The Harpur Trust is a charity in Bedford, England. The stated aim of the charity is to help and support the people who live in and around Bedford, and to help them improve their lives by:

* providing and promoting education
* offering help and relief to anyone who is sick, in need, in hardship or distress
* providing recreational facilities with a social welfare purpose for the people of Bedford and its surroundings.

Reorganised as a company limited by guarantee in 2012, it was previously called The Bedford Charity (The Harpur Trust) as its legal name, but was most often referred to as the Harpur Trust.

The main activities of the charity are the operation of a number of independent schools and one academy in Bedford. The charity also operates a number of almshouses in the Bedford area. In addition, the charity supports the community by giving grants to local projects. In 2009/10 it donated over £1,900,000 in grants to projects based in and around Bedford. This money is intended to help local organisations and individuals to make a difference to their own lives or those of others.

==History==

The Harpur Trust was established by Sir William Harpur (c.1496–1574). Harpur was a merchant from Bedford who became Lord Mayor of London in 1561. He was knighted in the following year. Sir William and his wife, Dame Alice, gave an endowment which consisted of some property in Bedford and of water-meadows which are now Holborn. It was to support free schooling, dowries for poor maidens and “poore chylders ther to be nurryshed and enformed”. In 1566, the Bedford Charity endowed Bedford School, which had been established in 1552, and founded &quot;the Writing School&quot; (later renamed Bedford Modern School) to teach copper plate handwriting. In 1764, the Harpur Trust was formally created by an act of Parliament, the (4 Geo. 3. c. &quot;72&quot;). It was not until 1882 that girls&#x27; education was endowed by the trust.

==Present day==

===Schools===
Today the Harpur Trust runs a range of fee-charging private schools:
* Bedford School for boys
* Bedford Modern School, co-educational 
* Bedford Girls&#x27; School (The school was founded in 2010 as the result of the merger between Dame Alice Harpur School and Bedford High School)

<text>Knut Emil Lundmark (14 June 1889 in Älvsbyn, Sweden – 23 April 1958 in Lund, Sweden), was a Swedish astronomer, professor of astronomy and head of the observatory at Lund University from 1929 to 1955.

Lundmark received his astronomical education at the observatory of Uppsala University. His dissertation (1920) was titled: &quot;The relations of the globular clusters and spiral nebulae to the stellar system&quot;. During the 1920s he worked at several observatories in the USA, mainly the Lick Observatory and the Mount Wilson Observatory.

Knut Lundmark was one of the pioneers in the modern study of the galaxies and their distances. He was one of the first to suspect that the galaxies are remote stellar systems at vast distances and not nearby objects belonging to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. In 1919 he measured the distance to M31 – the Andromeda Galaxy, to 650,000 light years (about a fourth of the present day value) using magnitudes of novae found in M31 and comparing them to nearby ones with known distances. Lundmark&#x27;s work contributed to the later famous Great Debate over whether nebulae were galaxies or concentrations of glowing gas.

Lundmark also studied the light distribution in the galaxies, and discovered that the distribution could only properly be explained if the galaxies contained vast amounts of light-blocking dark clouds.

He was the leading writer of popular astronomy among the professional astronomers in Sweden from the 1930s and onwards. He also often appeared in the Swedish national radio with programs on popular astronomy and the history of science. He made generations of Swedes fascinated and interested in astronomy.

The lunar crater &quot;Lundmark&quot; and the minor planet 1334 Lundmarka were named after him. The Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy is named after Lundmark, Max Wolf and Philibert Jacques Melotte.

Lundmark is also widely known by Chinese astronomers for his great work on the catalogue of novae.

== Dark matter ==
A recently found publication from 1930 shows Knut Lundmark to be the first to realise that the universe must contain much more mass than we can observe, now known as dark matter.

<doc id="1184772" wikidata="Q1571195" url="?curid=1184772" title="John Adams Hyman">
<text>John Adams Hyman (July 23, 1840 – September 14, 1891) was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina from 1875 to 1877. A Republican, he was the first African American to represent the state in the House of Representatives. He was elected from North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, including counties in the northeast around New Bern. Earlier he served in the North Carolina Senate.

==Early life ==
Born into slavery on July 23, 1840, near Warrenton, North Carolina, Hyman was later enslaved in Alabama. Hyman did not receive any formal education as a child. By 1861, he had returned to North Carolina and was working as a janitor for a jeweler named King in Warrenton. King was from Pennsylvania and taught Hyman to read and write; when this was discovered by whites in town, they forced King and his wife to leave the community. When Hyman persisted in trying to gain an education, at the age of 21 he was sold to a new master in Alabama. In twenty-five years as a slave, Hyman was sold at least eight times.

==Post-Civil War and political career==
After the Civil War and the emancipation of enslaved people, Hyman returned to North Carolina in 1865. He worked as a farmer and pursued elementary studies. He also established a grocery store in Warrenton.

Recognized for his leadership, Hyman was chosen as a delegate to the state equal rights convention in 1865 and to the state Constitutional Convention in 1868. Hyman was elected to the North Carolina Senate, where he served from 1868 to 1874 during the Reconstruction era.

In 1874, Hyman was elected as a Republican to the 44th United States Congress from North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, running against Democrat Garland H. White. He &quot;had swept Craven and seven other counties in the newly created district that became known as the &#x27;Black Second.&#x27;&quot; Democrats in the legislature had established the district to try to reduce black influence in politics in other parts of the state, as this was a black-majority area. The freedmen and previously free blacks elected all but two Republican representatives for the next quarter century. Hyman served for one term (March 4, 1875 – March 3, 1877). After unsuccessfully running for the Republican renomination to Congress in 1876 and losing to Curtis Brogden, the immediate past governor, Hyman returned to agricultural pursuits.

By 1877, New Bern had become a black-majority town; blacks elected representatives to the board of aldermen and the Craven County Commission, until the Democratic-dominated state legislature withdrew the county&#x27;s authority to govern itself. The county continued to elect at least one black legislator each session to the state house for another decade, as did other majority-black counties in the northeast part of the state.

Hyman was appointed as special deputy collector of internal revenue for the fourth district of North Carolina from July 1, 1877 to June 30, 1878.

He moved to Washington, D.C., after being accused of misappropriating church funds. He worked for the United States Post Office Department and for the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C.

== Legacy and honors ==
*A North Carolina historical marker has been installed in Warrenton, about a block from Hyman&#x27;s former homesite.

==Personal life==
Hyman had a wife and four children. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1891. He was buried in Columbian Harmony Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>The first USS &quot;Omaha&quot; was laid down in 1867 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard as &quot;Astoria&quot;; launched 10 June 1869; she was renamed &quot;Omaha&quot; on 10 August 1869; and commissioned 12 September 1872, Captain John C. Febiger in command.

==Service history==
===Atlantic Stations, 1873–1879===
&quot;Omaha&#x27;s&quot; first assignment was with the South Atlantic Squadron, and she served alternately on South and North Atlantic Stations from 1873 to 1879. From 1880 to 1884, &quot;Omaha&quot; was laid up in ordinary at Philadelphia, for a complete refit. By 1885 she was en route to the Asiatic Station via Cape Horn.

===Statue of Liberty, 1885===
Captain Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr., of the U. S. man-of-war Omaha, delegated a lieutenant to present his compliments to Captain De Saune, the French commander of the Isère, laden with the Statue of Liberty, and suggest that Gravesend Bay would be a safer anchorage than the Sandy Hook Horseshoe.

===Asiatic Station, 1885–1891===
&quot;Omaha&quot; served on the Asiatic Station from 1885 to 1891. In 1887, the captain of the ship, Thomas O. Selfridge Jr., conducted target practice off the coast of the Japanese island of Ikeshima which resulted in the deaths of four Japanese and the wounding of seven others. This created an international incident but Selfridge was acquitted at a court martial in 1888. In 1890, on the night of 8 February, she put ashore a detachment of officers and men to assist in fighting an extensive fire in the town of Hodogaya, Japan, on request of the United States Consul-General.

===Marine Hospital Service, 1891–1914===
In 1891, &quot;Omaha&quot; returned to Mare Island Navy Yard, where she decommissioned and was placed in ordinary. She never recommissioned, but later was turned over to the Marine Hospital Service, (which later became the U.S.Public Health Service) and subsequently anchored at Angel Island, California for use as a quarantine barge. &quot;Omaha&quot; served in this capacity until 1914, after which she was scrapped.

<text>The National Bamboo Project of Costa Rica was established in 1986 with the dual aims of reducing deforestation by means of replacing timber with bamboo as a primary building material and providing low cost housing for Costa Rica&#x27;s rural poor. 

==Achievement==
By cultivating and building with an indigenous form of giant bamboo called Guadua, the National Bamboo Project was able to raise thousands of new homes for the poor, benefit the environment, and advance bamboo-based building technology.

In 1995, the National Bamboo Project was handed over to the FUNBAMBU Foundation to maintain and continue the project&#x27;s mission of creating low-cost bamboo housing.

In August 1944, Sayyid Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, leader of the Ansar, met with senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss the formation of a pro-independence political party that was not associated with Mahdism. They launched a daily newspaper, &quot;al-Umma&quot; (The Community). In February 1945 the al-Umma party was organized and the party&#x27;s first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution made no mention of Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar. The only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party&#x27;s reliance on him for funding. However, rumors held that al-Umma had been created by the government and aimed to place Abd al-Rahman in power. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy.

During his premiership, Abdalla Khalil and several senior Umma officials instigated the 1958 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état, led by General Ibrahim Abboud.

Sadiq al-Mahdi was the prominent leader of the party through much of its history. Other historic members include Abdallah Bakr Mustafa.

=== Twenty-first century ===
In 2002, 37 elected members split from the National Umma Party and formed the Umma Party (Reform and Renewal) (UPRR) led by Mubarak al Fadil al Mahdi, Sadiq al-Mahdi&#x27;s first cousin. This party joined the ranks of the National Congress Party Government and stayed in power until Mubarak al-Fadil was dismissed from office. UPRR further split into four factions and later re-joined the National Umma Party.

All members of UPRR returned to the Umma National Party except for Mubarak al-Fadil due to allegations of conspiracy with South Sudan and for spreading slander and false information about colleagues in the National Umma Party and the opposition.

In 2010, the National Umma Party nominated Sadiq al-Mahdi as its presidential candidate in protest of &#x27;electoral irregularities&#x27;. Mahdi placed fourth, and the party gained one assembly seat.

===Sudanese Revolution===
As a component of the National Consensus Forces (NCF) that signed Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) charter on 1 January 2019, the Umma Party was integrated into the FFC alliance that coordinated the Sudanese Revolution and holds a strong constitutional role in the 39-month transitionary period to democracy.

On 4 November 2019, according to &quot;Sudan News Agency&quot;, one of the Umma Party vice-chairs, Mariam al-Mahdi (daughter of party leader Sadiq al-Mahdi), was nominated to the Central Council of the FFC as a representative of Sudan Call, while the NCF of which the Umma Party is a member, had five other representatives on the council.

=== Sudanese civil war ===
On 24 February 2025, the party removed Major General Fadlallah Burma Nasir as its acting leader after he affixed his signature on the agreement establishing the Sudan Founding Alliance and a Government of Peace and Unity aligned with the Rapid Support Forces on 22 February. He was replaced by Mohamed Abdallah Al-Douma. However, Nasir rejected his dismissal and ordered the dissolution of the party&#x27;s Presidential Institution.

== Factions ==
The most prominent Umma faction was the UPRR. Another faction of the UPRR is led by Information Minister Alzahawi Ibrahim Maalik.

Another faction is Umma Party (Collective Leadership) (UPCL), led by Dr. al Sadiq al Hadi al Mahdi, who is the nephew of Mubarak al Fadil and first cousin of Sadiq al Mahdi. Dr. al Sadiq is the son of Imam al Hadi al Mahdi who led a faction of the Umma Party that al Mahdi&#x27;s faction in the 1960s. Dr al Sadiq is an adviser to the President of Sudan. UPCL became part of the government and agreed to continue cooperation with Sudan&#x27;s ruling National Congress Party in the mid-interim period after 2008.

The last faction is the Federal Umma Party, led by Ahmad Babiker Nahar, ex-Secretary General of UPRR who formed his party because he was wrongfully fired by al Fadil. He became a member of Environment and Physical Development.

<text>Intuit Inc. is an American multinational business software company that specializes in financial software. The company is headquartered in Mountain View, California, and the CEO is Sasan Goodarzi. Intuit&#x27;s products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring and personal accounting service Credit Karma, and email marketing platform Mailchimp. more than 95% of its revenues and earnings come from its activities within the United States.

Intuit offered a free online service called TurboTax Free File as well as a similarly named service called TurboTax Free Edition which is not free for most users. In 2019, investigations by ProPublica found that Intuit deliberately steered taxpayers from the free TurboTax Free File to the paid TurboTax Free Edition using tactics including search engine delisting and a deceptive discount targeted to members of the military. As of the 2021 tax filing season, TurboTax no longer participates in the Free File Alliance.

Intuit has lobbied extensively against the IRS providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms, which is the norm in developed countries.

==History==
The company was founded in 1983 by Scott Cook and Tom Proulx in Palo Alto, California.

Intuit was conceived by Scott Cook, whose prior work at Procter &amp; Gamble helped him realize that personal computers would lend themselves towards replacements for paper-and-pencil based personal accounting. On his quest to find a programmer, he ended up running into Tom Proulx at Stanford University. The two started Intuit, which initially operated out of a modest room on University Avenue in Palo Alto. The first version of Quicken was coded in Microsoft&#x27;s BASIC programming language for the IBM PC and UCSD Pascal for the Apple II by Tom Proulx and had to contend with a dozen serious competitors.

In 1991, Microsoft decided to produce a competitor to Quicken called Microsoft Money. To win retailers&#x27; loyalty, Intuit included a US$15 rebate coupon, redeemable on software customers purchased in their stores. This was the first time a software company offered a rebate.

Roughly around the same time the company engaged John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins and diversified its product lineup. In 1993 Intuit went public and used the proceeds to make a key acquisition: the tax-preparation software company Chipsoft based in San Diego. The time after the IPO was marked by rapid growth and culminated with a buyout offer from Microsoft in 1994; at this time Intuit&#x27;s market capitalization reached US$2 billion. However, the United States Department of Justice sued to block the acquisition.

The company came under intense pressure in the late 1990s when Microsoft started to compete vigorously with its core Quicken business. In response, Intuit launched new web-based products and put more emphasis on QuickBooks and on TurboTax. The company made a number of investments around this time. Among others, it purchased a large stake in Excite and acquired Lacerte Software, a Dallas-based developer of tax preparation software used by tax professionals. It also divested its online bill payment service unit in exchange for an equity stake in CheckFree.

In June 2013, Intuit announced it would sell its financial services unit to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $1.03 billion.

As of May 2018, Intuit had more than US$5 billion in annual revenue and a market capitalization of about US$50 billion. In August 2018, the company announced that Sasan Goodarzi would become Intuit&#x27;s leader and CEO at the beginning of 2019. Previous CEO Brad Smith will remain chairman of Intuit&#x27;s board of directors. In August 2020, Intuit QuickBooks Canada was expected to reveal intentions to partner with Digital Main Street, as the company aims to help digitally turn Canadian small businesses. 

In July 2024, Intuit announced it would lay off 1,800 employees, or 10% of its workforce, in order to refocus resources on generative AI initiatives.

== Legal issues ==

Intuit formerly offered a free online service called TurboTax Free File as well as a similarly named service called TurboTax Free Edition which is not free for most users. TurboTax Free File was developed as part of an agreement whereby members of the Free File Alliance would offer tax preparation for individuals below an income threshold for free in exchange for the IRS not providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms. In 2019, investigations by ProPublica found that Intuit deliberately steered taxpayers from the free TurboTax Free File to the paid TurboTax Free Edition using tactics including search engine delisting and a deceptive discount targeted to members of the military. Subsequent investigations by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the New York State Department of Financial Services reached similar conclusions, the latter concluding that Intuit engaged in &quot;unfair and abusive practices&quot;.
As of 2022, Intuit is the subject of multiple lawsuits and is under investigation by the FTC and several state attorneys general. On May 4, 2022, Intuit agreed to pay a $141 million settlement over misleading advertisements.

=== Canada ===

Intuit Canada ULC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Intuit, is a developer of financial management and tax preparation software for personal finance and small business accounting. Services are delivered on a variety of platforms including application software, software connected to services, software as a service, platform as a service and mobile applications. Intuit Canada has employees located all across Canada, with offices in Edmonton, Alberta, and Toronto, Ontario.

Intuit Canada traces its origins to the 1993 acquisition by Intuit of a Canadian tax preparation software developer. In 1992, Edmontonians and University of Alberta graduates Bruce Johnson and Chad Frederick had built a tax preparation product called WINTAX – Canada&#x27;s first Microsoft Windows-based personal tax preparation software. In 1993, they agreed to be acquired by Chipsoft, manufacturer of the U.S. personal income tax software TurboTax. Shortly after the WINTAX acquisition, Chipsoft agreed to merge with Intuit, the developer of the Quicken financial software. Intuit Canada continued to update and support the WINTAX software, which was renamed QuickTax in 1995 and then renamed TurboTax in 2010. Intuit Canada quickly became the hub for international development at Intuit, producing localized versions of Quicken and QuickBooks for Canada (in French and English) and the United Kingdom. The U.K. version of Quicken was discontinued in 2005.

*TaxWiz – Tax preparation software – the company purchased in 2002, discontinued in 2007.
*WillExpert – A software package for preparing personal wills (for use within all of Canada with the exception of Quebec, due to specific provincial legislation).

In 2008, Intuit Canada discontinued the TaxWiz software and added QuickTax Basic to their lineup. Changes made by the Canada Revenue Agency forced Intuit and other tax preparing software companies to limit the number of returns available from their software to 20. This caused Intuit Canada to stop offering QuickTax Pro50 and Pro100 products, and they now offer QuickTax 20 as an alternative. Intuit Canada has since announced that for the 2010 tax year, they will discontinue use of the name QuickTax and replace it with the name TurboTax – thus bringing the product in line with Intuit&#x27;s American tax-filing software.

These include the QuickBooks and TurboTax online communities for QuickBooks users and small business owners and tax payers respectively, Quicken Online Community for Quicken users and those who need help with the personal finances, and the Accountant Online Community and Jump Up.

Free tools and services included an interactive business planner, online training for developing a successful business plan, starting costs calculator, cash flow calculator, break-even calculator, templates for business planning and sample business plans.

TaxAlmanac was a free online tax research resource. The site included information including the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, Tax Court Cases, and a variety of articles. This site was up for closure but due to massive feedback, has reminded up.

Modeled after English Wikipedia, TaxAlmanac was launched in May 2005. The June 6, 2005 edition of Time magazine featured an article entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Wiki, Wiki World&quot; about English Wikipedia in which TaxAlmanac was highlighted as &quot;A Community of Customers&quot;. The November 21, 2005 edition of &quot;Business Week&quot; featured an article titled &quot;50 Smart Ways to Use the Web&quot; in which TaxAlmanac was selected as one of the 50. The product made the short list as one of the 7 in the collaboration category. Intuit archives TaxAlmanac effective June 1, 2014. Many of the users have migrated to a new site called TaxProTalk.com.

Zipingo was a free website where users could rate services such as contractors, restaurants, and other businesses. Ratings and comments were either entered from the website or through Quicken and QuickBooks. The site was closed by Intuit on August 23, 2007.

==Lobbying==

Intuit has lobbied extensively against the IRS providing taxpayers with free pre-filled forms, as is the norm in developed countries.

In 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Intuit spent nearly $2 million in political contributions to eliminate free online state tax filing for low-income residents in California. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, from 2009 to 2014, Intuit spent nearly $13 million lobbying, as reported by OpenSecrets, as much as Apple. Intuit spent $1 million on the race for the California state comptroller to support Tony Strickland, a Republican who opposed ReadyReturn, against John Chiang, a Democrat who supported ReadyRun (and won). Joseph Bankman, professor of tax law, Stanford Law School, and advocate of simplified filing, believes that the campaign warned politicians that if they supported free filing, Intuit would help their opponents.

On March 26, 2013, ProPublica reported that the company lobbied against return-free filing as recently as 2011. One year later, ProPublica reported that the company appeared to be linked to a number of op-eds and letters to Congress in a campaign advocating against direct tax filing backed by the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, an advocacy organization of which Intuit is a member.

In October 2019, Propublica reported again that Intuit used &quot;lobbying, the revolving door and dark pattern customer tricks&quot; to fend off the US government&#x27;s attempts to make tax filing free and easy, and created its multi-billion-dollar franchise.

==Lawsuits==
An antitrust lawsuit and a class-action suit relating to cold calling employees of other companies were settled out of court along with Apple and Google.

In March 2015, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and computer reporter Brian Krebs reported that two former employees alleged that Intuit knowingly allowed fraudulent returns to be processed on a massive scale as part of a revenue-boosting scheme. Both employees, former security team members for the company, stated that the company had ignored repeated warnings and suggestions on how to prevent fraud. One of the employees was reported to have filed a whistleblower complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

=== FTC Lawsuit Over Intuit&#x27;s &#x27;Free&#x27; Tax Filing Claims - pending ===
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken legal action against Intuit Inc., the maker of TurboTax software, for deceptive advertising practices. They allege that Intuit&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; tax filing claims are misleading, as they are not accessible to a significant number of taxpayers, including gig economy workers and those with farm income. To prevent further harm, the FTC has filed both an administrative complaint and a federal district court complaint, seeking to halt Intuit&#x27;s deceptive advertising. The outcome of this legal action will determine the company&#x27;s accountability in the matter.

<text>Imba Alaje is a mountain, or an amba, in northern Ethiopia. Located in the Debubawi Zone of the Tigray Region, Imba Alaje dominates the roadway that runs past it from the city of Mek&#x27;ele south to Maychew. Because of its strategic location, Emba Alaje has been the site of several battles. As Anthony Mockler describes it,
: It was [a] real &quot;amba&quot;, flat-topped, covered with crevices and canyons and caves, impregnable on the north and north-east where the Tug Gabat ran round its flanks through precipitous ravines, falling steeply away in the rear to the spur of Antalo, behind which lay the broad plain of Mahera.

The village of Adi Gura is located on the north side of the mountain at an elevation of 2,700 meter. The larger town of Ambalage is located five kilometer to the south of the mountain.

==Geology==
The mountain is largely composed of Alaji Basalts, the youngest succession of the Ethiopian flood basalts. The most recent flows are only 15 million years old. The geological formation was called after Imba Alaje by geologist William Thomas Blanford, who accompanied the British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868. In roadcuts, there are conspicuous outcrops of whitish interbedded lacustrine sedimentary deposits.

==Hydrology==
There are many springs on the slopes of the mountain. On the northern flank at Addi Gura&#x27;i, the Mercy water bottling plant is located.

== Alagi Pass ==
Just three kilometers to the southeast of the top of Amba Alagi is the Alagi Pass. Here, the Ethiopian Highway 2 crosses the mountain ridge at an elevation of 3,090 meter above sea level. To the south, the road starts climbing from Ambalage at 2,450 meters.

==History==
The first mention of Imba Alaje is in the Chronicle of Emperor Baeda Maryam (1468–1478 AD), who personally led an expedition against the Dobe&#x27;a, who lived around Imba Alaje and raided the caravan routes. In the early 19th century, &quot;Ras&quot; Wolde Selassie controlled the amba, and used it on 18 August 1811 to imprison Gebre Guro, the brother of Sabagadis, for 18 months because he had rebelled against the &quot;Ras&quot;. The road built from the coast south to Magdala during the British 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia passed through Imba Alaje. A generation later, the mountain was the scene of a battle in February 1889 between &quot;Ras&quot; Alula Engida and &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum Gebre in which Alula was wounded.

===First Battle of Imba Alaje===
The first Battle of Imba Alaje occurred in December 1895. On December 7, 30,000 Ethiopians destroyed an Italian column of 2,350 led by Pietro Toselli and a day later, on December 8, the Ethiopian emperor, Menelik II, drove out the Italian forces of General Oreste Baratieri. After the defeat, the Italians withdrew from Imba Alaje to their half-finished fort at Mekele which Menelik then besieged for 15 days (6–21 January 1896).

===Second Battle of Imba Alaje===
The second Battle of Imba Alaje was fought in May 1941, during World War II, part of the East African Campaign. The mountain had galleries carved into the rock to protect the defending troops and hold ample ammunition and stores. The defenders, Italian troops under command of the Viceroy, the Duke of Aosta, thought themselves to be impregnable. The initial attacks on the approaches to Amba Alagi by British troops under Major-General Mayne from the north, commenced on May 4 with a pincer from the eastern and western sides. There was hard fighting in the jagged mountainous terrain. Mayne&#x27;s troops were joined on May 12 by Brigadier Dan Pienaar&#x27;s 1st South African Brigade, which had captured the Italian garrison of Dessie (April 20) located 200 miles south of Imba Alaje, and by May 14 Imba Alaje was completely surrounded. A final assault was planned for the next day but a lucky strike by an artillery shell hit an Italian fuel dump, sending a stream of oil into their last remaining drinking water and forcing the garrison&#x27;s surrender.

The film &quot;La Pattuglia dell&#x27;Amba Alagi&quot;, shot in 1953 by Flavio Calzavara, glorifies the Italian defense against the British.

===Third Battle of Amba Alagi===
In 1943, Imba Alaje was the location of the decisive battle of the &quot;Woyane Rebellion&quot; in Enderta Province. After capturing Mek&#x27;ele, the Woyane rebels swept south to the mountain where they encountered a government force consisting of 2,000 regular soldiers and 8,000 territorials. From 18 September through 6 October 1943, rebels under the personal leadership of Blatta Haile Mariam Redda repeatedly stormed the government positions, until artillery barrages and British Blenheim bombers at last dispersed the rebels.

<doc id="1184821" wikidata="Q764291" url="?curid=1184821" title="Chicagoland Speedway">
<text>Chicagoland Speedway is an inactive tri-oval intermediate speedway in Joliet, Illinois. It has hosted various major races throughout its existence, including NASCAR and IndyCar races. The track is currently owned by NASCAR, and features a 47,000-seat capacity as of 2019.

During the 1990s stock car racing boom, NASCAR, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and Menards formed the Motorsports Alliance to find a new market to construct an intermediate oval, eventually deciding on the Chicago market. After failed proposals at the DuPage Airport and the town of Plano, the city of Joliet was chosen after the Alliance partnered with the Route 66 Raceway in 1999. Construction began within the year and was completed in 2001. After 18 years of racing, due to attendance woes, all major racing at the facility stopped. Since 2020, with the exception of a one-off SuperMotocross race in 2023, the facility has stayed largely dormant.

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===

Chicagoland Speedway in its current form is measured at , with 18° of banking in the track&#x27;s turns, 11° of banking on the frontstretch, and 5° of banking on the backstretch. Unlike most intermediate oval tracks, the backstretch is a singular continuous curve instead of a straight line. The track&#x27;s length has been disputed by varying sanctioning bodies; NASCAR utilized a length of while the IndyCar Series utilized a length of . 

=== Amenities ===
Chicagoland Speedway is located in Joliet, Illinois, and is served by Illinois Route 53 and Interstate 80. As of 2019, the facility has a seating capacity of 47,000 according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. The entire facility encompasses approximately of land according to the &quot;Journal Star&quot;.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===

==== Failed proposals ====

In December 1996, DuPage Airport officials began hearing proposals of the construction of a potential racing facility on land owned by the airport. Out of three proposals, the one chosen by the airport&#x27;s board was a intermediate oval funded by the Motorsports Alliance, a partnership between International Speedway Corporation (ISC), the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and Menards. Initial plans for the $50 million proposal included seating capacity for 40–80 thousand and an opening date in 1999. The proposed racetrack quickly faced opposition; by February 1997, numerous anti-racetrack groups were formed, including in West Chicago and Geneva. Two months later, the plan was killed after numerous factors, including increasing public opposition, concerns about the track&#x27;s environmental impact, and disagreements between DuPage Airport officials and the Motorsports Alliance in lease revenues made the location unfeasible. In August 1997, the Motorsports Alliance announced plans to pursue a location in either Plano, Illinois, or northwest Indiana. By February 1998, the proposal was narrowed to Plano; however, by January 1999, the plan was scrapped in favor for a proposal in Joliet, Illinois.

==== Joliet proposal ====
On January 6, 1999, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; reported that the Motorsports Alliance was seeking to annex in Joliet, with a hearing scheduled on the 19th for its approval. The location was later revealed to be a plot of land northeast of the Route 66 Raceway, with the owners of Route 66 Raceway partnering with the Alliance&#x27;s proposal. On the 19th, the Joliet City Council unanimously approved the $100 million, 75,000-seat project. Within the month, the Motorsports Alliance spurred efforts for the plot of land to be included into the Des Plaines River Valley Enterprise Zone for a tax break worth up to $10 million over 10 years, which was fully approved four months later. In response to local residents&#x27; concerns regarding traffic, in February, the Alliance promised to invest $3.7 million towards nearby road improvements. In May, the Alliance announced plans to start construction in the summer of 1999 and open sometime in 2001. That same month, the Alliance and Route 66 Raceway owner Dale Coyne formed a joint company named Raceway Associates to run the facility, with the Alliance owning 75% and Coyne owning 25%. Two months later, NASCAR executive Mike Helton confirmed discussions about adding a potential NASCAR Winston Cup Series to their schedule for the 2001 season. By August, earthmovers began preparing the land for groundbreaking.

==== Construction ====
Groundbreaking on the facility occurred on September 28, 1999, with NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt appearing as a dignitary. On May 8, 2000, track officials officially confirmed the addition of the facility to both the NASCAR Winston Cup Series and the Indy Racing League (IRL) for 2001; additionally, the track was also formally named as the &quot;Chicagoland Speedway&quot;, with Joie Chitwood III being named as the general manager of the track. By September 2000, construction on the facility was &quot;more than half done&quot; according to &quot;Southtown Star&quot; writer John Debberstein, with the track itself being described as a oval with 18.5° of banking in the track&#x27;s turns, 11° of banking on the frontstretch, and 5° of banking on the backstretch. The first tests done on the facility were conducted on October 26, with drivers John Andretti and Scott Sharp driving a NASCAR Cup car and Indy-car, respectively. On February 1, 2001, the only construction fatality occurred when worker Ehren Brandau fell while installing windows to a skybox. By the end of its construction, the entire facility cost approximately $130 million (adjusted for inflation, $).

=== Operating years ===
Chicagoland Speedway officially opened to the public on July 12, 2001, for practice sessions for the 2001 Tropicana 400, a Cup Series race. The track&#x27;s first race, a second-tier NASCAR Busch Series (now called the Xfinity Series) race, was ran two days later with Jimmie Johnson winning the first race at the track. A day later, the Tropicana 400 was ran, with Kevin Harvick winning the first highlight race at the facility. The track&#x27;s first Indy Racing League (now called the IndyCar Series) occurred on September 2, with Buddy Lazier winning the event. A year later, the track recorded the closest finish in IndyCar history, with Sam Hornish Jr. winner over Al Unser Jr. by 0.0024 seconds. In 2003, Matthew Alexander replaced Chitwood as the general manager of Chicagoland Speedway. The following year, SAFER barriers were installed throughout the entire outside perimeter of the track at a cost of approximately $1.5 million.

In February 2007, ISC bought out Raceway Associates for $102.4 million, taking full control over both Chicagoland Speedway and Route 66 Raceway. A month later, Alexander was promoted to president of the speedway. Within the year, Alexander announced the installation of lights to accommodate night racing; the $17 million installation was completed in time for the 2008 LifeLock.com 400. In 2009, Alexander stepped down as president of the speedway, with Craig Rust replacing Alexander. Rust&#x27;s tenure was brief; he stepped down in September 2010 and was replaced by Scott Paddock four months later. In the 2010s, the track underwent two seating capacity declines due to attendance declines: one in 2013 that decreased capacity to 55,000, and one in 2019 that decreased capacity to 47,000. Also in 2019, the facility was bought out by NASCAR when the sanctioning body bought out ISC.

=== Departure of NASCAR ===
Although a NASCAR Cup Series race was scheduled in 2020, the race was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, plans were made to convert of the facility&#x27;s parking lots into warehouse storage; however, the plan faced opposition from the Joliet City Council Economic Development Committee and was rejected by the Joliet Plan Commission in August. In September, NASCAR announced that all three national series would not return to Chicagoland Speedway for the 2021 season, leaving the track with an uncertain future. Paddock resigned as president a month later. The track was left widely dormant in the following years after NASCAR&#x27;s departure. In 2022, the track was used to store vehicles awaiting computer chips from the Ford Motor Company in the midst of the 2021 global semiconductor shortage. The following year, the SuperMotocross World Championship announced that they would host races at the facility for their 2023 season; the races ran in September, becoming the first motorsports event at the facility in over four years.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 211 (VFA-211), nicknamed the &quot;Fighting Checkmates&quot;, is an aviation unit of the United States Navy established in 1945. The squadron is based at Naval Air Station Oceana and is equipped with the Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet.

==Insignia and nickname==
The squadron insignia depicts a character known as &quot;Brutus&quot; holding a rocket, from the original logo for VB-74. Eleven stars are arranged in groups of seven and four to mark the squadron&#x27;s numerical designation, &quot;SEVEN FOUR&quot;. The shield recalls the squadron&#x27;s sixteen-year association with the F-8 Crusader. By tradition, the &quot;Brutus&quot; mascot is painted on an aircraft whenever the Fighting Checkmates spend Christmas away from home. The squadron&#x27;s radio call sign is &quot;Nickel.&quot;

==History==
Three U.S. Navy squadrons have been designated VF-211. The first was established in 1948 and disestablished in 1949. The second VF-211 was established in 1955 and later redesignated VF-24 in 1959. The third VF-211 was established as VB-74 in 1945, eventually became VFA-211, and is the subject of this article.

===1940s===

Bombing Squadron Seventy Four (VB-74) was established on 1 May 1945 at NAAF Otis Field, Massachusetts. Their first aircraft was the SBW-4E Helldiver. The squadron soon moved to East Field, NAS Norfolk and deployed on on 31 October 31 1945. In 1946 the squadron was redesignated Attack Squadron 1B (VA-1B) and began transition to the AD-1 Skyraider. Two years later the squadron transitioned to AD-2 Skyraider and was redesignated Attack Squadron Twenty Four (VA-24) on 1 September 1948. Skyraider aircraft were soon grounded due to engine problems and VA-24 transitioned to the F4U Corsair six weeks before deploying with . After the deployment the squadron moved to NAS Oceana and on December 1, 1949 the VA-24 was redesignated Fighter Squadron Twenty Four (VF-24).

===1950s===
VF-24 moved to NAS Alameda and made two back-to-back deployment in support of the Korean War aboard and , bombing enemy emplacements, rail yards, bridges, warehouses and airfields.

Following their second deployment, VF-24 relocated to NALF Santa Rosa, California, and transitioned to the F9F-2 Panther, the squadron&#x27;s first jet fighter. In February 1952, VF-24 deployed once again with USS &quot;Boxer&quot; to Korea for their third combat tour, which included a strike on Pyongyang on August 29. Upon their return home, VF-24 moved to NAS Alameda.

During the rest of the 1950s, VF-24 flew a number of aircraft, including the FJ Fury, the FJ-3M, the F3H-2M Demon, the F-11F Tiger and the F-8 Crusader at NAS Moffett Field. On 9 March 1959, VF-24 traded air wings, insignia, and designations with the VF-211 &quot;Checkmates&quot;.

VF-211 was assigned to Carrier Air Group 21 (CVG-21) aboard for a Western Pacific deployment from 25 April to 3 December 1959.

===1960s===
In 1961 the squadron moved to NAS Miramar, which would be its home for the next 35 years.

===1970s===

In 1975, VF-211 transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat, deploying with Carrier Air Wing Nine in April 1977 aboard . The squadron completed numerous WESTPAC deployments aboard USS &quot;Constellation&quot; during the 1970s and 1980s.

===1980s===
In 1980 VF-211 added the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System TARPS mission. In 1983, VF-211 changed carriers to . In 1985 they deployed with as USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was upgraded to handle F/A-18 Hornets. VF-211 would move to USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and in the following years. In 1986 VF-211 took part in trials of experimental water based camouflage schemes, painting at least four aircraft in temporary schemes that consisted of browns and greys, three different shades of each colour being used. In April 1989, VF-211 upgraded to the F-14A+ (later designated F-14B).

===1990s===

In 1991, VF-211 deployed to support the aftermath of the Gulf War, providing air superiority and aerial reconnaissance imagery to coalition forces. In 1992, the squadron had to revert to the F-14A due to the decision to move all F-14Bs to Atlantic Fleet Squadrons. VF-211 would make regular deployments to the Persian Gulf in the 1990s. In 1996 VF-211 became the last west coast F-14 squadron after VF-24 was disbanded, and moved to NAS Oceana on the east coast as NAS Miramar was handed over to the US Marines. In 1996 the unit also received LANTIRN capable F-14s and went on cruise in September 1997 in support of Operation Southern Watch, spending four months in the Persian Gulf. VF-211 flew daily sorties over Iraq, enforcing the United Nations imposed no-fly zone, providing aerial reconnaissance imagery and precision strike capability.

===2000s===
In 2000, VF-211 and the rest of CVW-9 joined for a Millennium Cruise, spending four months in the Persian Gulf enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq.

After the September 11 attacks, the squadron deployed with CVW-9, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom combat missions over Afghanistan. In early 2002, the squadron directly supported the three-week-long battle Operation Anaconda, flying 1,250 combat sorties, logging 4,200 combat hours and dropped of ordnance and was awarded the VADM &quot;Sweetpea&quot; Allen Precision Strike Award for 2002. On their return home to the US, they transitioned to Carrier Air Wing One aboard .

In 2002 the squadron received the Commander Naval Air Force Pacific Fleet, BATTLE &quot;E&quot; for battle efficiency, the Commander Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet GRAND SLAM Award for excellence in Air-to-Air employment, and the Clifton Award for the most outstanding overall performance in battle efficiency and employment. In late 2003, VF-211 deployed for their final F-14 cruise in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, flying mostly reconnaissance, &quot;show of force&quot; and ground support missions.
After their return to NAS Oceana in 2004, VF-211 began transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and was redesignated VFA-211, becoming the first operational East Coast Super Hornet squadron. In 2006, VFA-211 deployed in support of both Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. On September 8, 2006, VFA-211 F/A-18F Super Hornets expended GBU-12 and GBU-38 bombs against Taliban targets near Kandahar. The squadron returned to NAS Oceana on 18 November 2006, after flying hundreds of combat sorties and expending dozens of precision guided weapons in support of ground forces.

In early 2008, the squadron transitioned to Block II Super Hornets, equipped with AN/APG-79 AESA radar.

===2010s===
In January 2011, VFA-211 joined CVW-1 on board the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CVN-65) for a deployment supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in the 5th Fleet area of responsibility.

In December 2012 USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CVN-65) was taken out of service and VFA-211 remained assigned to CVW-1.

===2020s===

In July 2020, VFA-211 became the first strike fighter squadron to transition from the F/A-18F to the F/A-18E Super Hornet.

From December 2021 to September 2022, VFA-211 deployed onboard the USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; (CVN-75) as a part of Carrier Air Wing 1, Carrier Strike Group 8. During this deployment, VFA-211 supported NATO interests via Air Policing missions in the Adriatic, Ionian, and Aegean Seas.

One of the squadron&#x27;s F/A-18E Super Hornets was lost on 8 July 2022, when it was blown overboard into the Mediterranean Sea during unexpected heavy weather. The aircraft was later recovered and loaded on a Military Sealift Command ship for transport back to the United States.

VFA-211 is part of CVW-11, currently attached to the USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; (CVN-71).

<text>Sadiq al-Mahdi (; 25 December 1935 – 26 November 2020), also known as Sadiq as-Siddiq, was a Sudanese political and religious figure who was Prime Minister of Sudan from 1966 to 1967 and again from 1986 to 1989. He was head of the National Umma Party and Imam of the Ansar, a Sufi order that pledges allegiance to Muhammad Ahmad (1844–1885), who claimed to be the Mahdi, the messianic saviour of Islam.

==Political life==
Sadiq al-Mahdi was Prime Minister of Sudan on two occasions: first briefly between 1966 and 1967 and second from 1986 until his ousting on 30 June 1989.

===First term as prime minister (1966–1967)===
After the 1965 elections, a coalition government was formed between the National Umma Party and the National Unionist Party. Muhammad Ahmad Mahgoub of the Umma party became prime minister, and Ismail al-Azhari of the NUP became president. However, this coalition collapsed in October 1965 after the two parties failed to agree on control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In July 1966, Prime Minister Mahgoub resigned after a parliamentary vote of censure.
Mahgoub&#x27;s resignation split the Umma party into two factions: the opposition faction was led by Mahgoub and endorsed by Sadiq&#x27;s uncle, the Imam al-Hadi al-Mahdi, while Sadiq led the faction that was willing to work with the NUP. As Sadiq&#x27;s faction was larger, he became prime minister with NUP support. He supported regional development and greater autonomy for the southern provinces. These proposals were unpopular with many educated Sudanese civilians and army officers. In May 1967, Sadiq lost the support of his coalition partners, and Mahgoub returned as prime minister in a coalition with the National Unionist Party and the People&#x27;s Democratic Party. In the 1968 elections, Sadiq&#x27;s faction won more seats than Mahgoub&#x27;s faction, but Sadiq lost his own seat to a candidate from Mahgoub&#x27;s faction.

===In the opposition (1967–1986)===

Jaafar Nimeiry took power in Sudan through a coup on 25 May 1969. After the attack on Aba Island in March 1970, Sadiq was imprisoned repeatedly by Nimeiry, finally going into exile in 1974. From abroad, Sadiq formed an opposition organization known as the National Front. In 1977, Sadiq and Nimeiry negotiated an agreement that freed 1,000 political prisoners, granted amnesty to Sadiq, allowed nonpartisan opposition candidates in Parliament, and planned further democratic reforms. Sadiq then returned and started forming an opposition to Nimeiry&#x27;s Sudanese Socialist Union.

===Second term as prime minister (1986–1989)===
After the 1986 elections, Sadiq formed a coalition government comprising the Umma Party (which he led); the National Islamic Front (led by his brother-in-law, Hassan al-Turabi); the Democratic Unionist Party (led by Mohammed Uthman al-Mirghani al-Khatim); and four small Southern parties. However, this coalition proved to be unstable, preventing Sadiq from delivering on his promises to end the Second Sudanese Civil War and fix the ongoing economic crisis. On 30 June 1989, his government was overthrown in a coup led by Brigadier Omar al-Bashir. The post of Prime Minister of Sudan was then abolished.

===1989 coup and afterwards===

Sadiq continued to lead the Umma Party in opposition to Bashir after being ousted. He spent a period in exile, but eventually returned to Sudan in November 2000. As a former head of government, he joined the Club of Madrid.

He ran unsuccessfully for the 2010 presidential elections, pledging not to hand Bashir to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes on the grounds that it would destabilize the country. In 2014, the government alleged that Sadiq had collaborated with rebels, forcing him to flee to Egypt. He eventually returned to Khartoum on 26 January 2017.

In April 2019, Bashir was himself ousted by a coup after months of mass protests. Sadiq affirmed his party&#x27;s support for the protests and confirmed that they would not be part of any future civilian transitional government. He also opined that Sudan should join the International Criminal Court and hand over Bashir to face charges. In May 2019, Sadiq announced his retirement from electoral politics.

On October 24, 2020, as Sudan began to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel, Mahdi strongly condemned the move, while accusing U.S. president Donald Trump (a chief facilitator of the deal) of being racist against Muslims and black people, and calling Israel an &quot;apartheid state.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sadiq al-Mahdi was born on 25 December 1935 in Al-Abasya, Omdurman, Sudan.

He was the paternal grandson of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, founder of the Umma Party, and great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmad, the Sudanese sheikh of the Ansar and self-proclaimed Mahdi who started the Mahdist War to end Egyptian rule in Sudan. He was also the paternal uncle of Sudanese-British actor Alexander Siddig.

Sadiq al-Mahdi married twice and had ten children, including a son named Siddig after his grandfather al-Imam al-Siddiq, born in 1968, who is now a leader in National Umma Party, and a daughter, Mariam, who is the leader of the National Umma Party.

On 26 November 2020, Sadiq died of complications from COVID-19, after being admitted to a hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for nearly a month.

==Publishing career==
He was the author of a variety of scholarly and political books, including &quot;The Southern Question&quot; (1964); &quot;Speeches in Exile&quot; (1976); &quot;Questions on Mahadism&quot; (1979); &quot;Legitimate Penalties and Their Position in the Islamic Social System&quot; (1987); &quot;Democracy in Sudan: Will Return and Triumph&quot; (1990); &quot;Challenges of the Nineties&quot; (1991). In addition to his political career, he is remembered for helping theorize and explicate &quot;a new kind of religious thought which would draw out of the Qur’an and Hadith a &quot;shari‘a&quot; which was adapted to the needs of the modern world.&quot; Professor of History Albert Hourani characterizes Sadiq&#x27;s intellectual contributions as &quot;responsible but bold.&quot;

<text>Gateway Motorsports Park (now known as World Wide Technology Raceway) is a motorsport racing facility in Madison, Illinois, just east of St. Louis, close to the Gateway Arch. It features a oval that hosts the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the NTT IndyCar Series, a infield road course used by SpeedTour TransAm, SCCA, and Porsche Club of America, a quarter-mile NHRA-sanctioned drag strip that hosts the annual NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series Midwest Nationals event, and the Kartplex, a state-of-the-art karting facility.

The first major event held at the facility was the CART Series on Saturday May 24, 1997, the day before the Indy Racing League&#x27;s Indianapolis 500. Rather than scheduling a race directly opposite the Indy 500 (as they had done in 1996 with the U.S. 500), CART scheduled Gateway the day before to serve as their Memorial Day weekend open-wheel alternative without direct conflict. For 2000, the race was moved to the fall. In 2001, it was dropped from the CART series schedule, and switched alliances to the Indy Racing League. After mediocre attendance, the event was dropped altogether after 2003. It was later re-added to the schedule for 2017.

In 1998, the then named Gateway International Raceway was purchased by Dover Motorsports, a group that also owned what is now Memphis International Raceway, along with the Nashville Superspeedway and Dover International Speedway. On November 3, 2010, Dover Motorsports closed the facility. On September 8, 2011, the facility was re-opened by local St. Louis real estate developer and former Indy Lights driver Curtis Francois and renamed Gateway Motorsports Park, saving the facility days before being scrapped. Under its new leadership, World Wide Technology Raceway went from the brink of demolition to one of the very few tracks in the United States to host the NASCAR Cup Series, NTT IndyCar Series, and NHRA Drag Racing Series all during the same year. The track also hosts Formula Drift, the Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series and the Confluence Music Festival.

==Track history==
=== Former tracks ===
St. Louis International Raceway was built in 1967 as a drag racing facility by Wayne and Ruth Meinert on property originally purchased by David Bergfield. Initially conceived as a drag strip, the track was extended to a full in 1971. Having been developed on dormant swampland that was long ago buried by the Mississippi River, the track soon adapted the nickname of &quot;The Swamp&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s, the raceway primarily held regional drag racing events. However, entering the early 1980s, the interest of adding a road racing circuit to the grounds began to mount, and in 1985 a road course was constructed by then-owner Jody Trover, featuring and configurations. The asphalt circuit had a track width, 55 pit boxes within the pit lane, and could officially hold 52,000 spectators. Parts of the existing drag strip were incorporated into the road course build. Coming into Turn 4 was a slight left-hander onto the drag strip&#x27;s shutdown portion, and after snaking around the back half of the dragway, Turn 12 turned left onto the drag strip back towards the starting line to complete the lap. The course would welcome ARCA, IMSA, and the Trans-Am Series in its inaugural year.

Also in 1985, a quarter midget dirt track was established at the back right corner of the property when pulling into the facility.

In 1994, Chris Pook, promoter of the Grand Prix of Long Beach, acquired the facility for $21.5 million. The existing tracks were demolished over the course of 1995–1996 and a new oval speedway and drag strip were constructed at a cost of $25 million.

===Current tracks===

The oval is a favorite for many fans and racers alike due to the unique shape and different degrees of banking in each corner. The backstretch is confined to run parallel with Illinois Route 203, making Turns 1 &amp; 2 a tighter radius than Turns 3 &amp; 4. Turns 1 &amp; 2 have similar characteristics to New Hampshire Motor Speedway while Turns 3 &amp; 4 are similar to Phoenix Raceway. The track&#x27;s egg shape mimics the legendary Darlington Raceway and Mobility Resort Motegi race tracks.

The infield of the oval track includes a road course that features a configuration.

=== Timeline of notable events ===

* On June 24 and June 25, 1972, Evel Knievel made a stop at the then-named St. Louis International Raceway for two motorcycle jumps. Arriving via his private plane that used the drag strip as a runway, he successfully jumped his Harley-Davidson XR-750 over 10 cars on both days.
* One of the last major events held on the original road course was Round 8 of the AMA Superbike Championship in 1995. Canadian Miguel Duhamel won the class in blistering hot conditions. The near triple-digit heat wave triggered local heat advisories which majorly impacted attendance.
* In 1997, CART, the NASCAR Busch Series, and the NHRA would all be newcomers to the revitalized Gateway International Raceway.
* Before the 1999 racing season, Gateway installed the now-named Wallace Grandstand in turns 1 &amp; 2 of the oval track to increase seating capacity. The grandstand is named in honor of the Wallace family&#x27;s trio of racing brothers who were born and raised in the St. Louis region—Rusty, Mike, and Kenny.
* Metallica&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium Tour made a stop at Gateway on July 3, 2000. Other artists featured at the concert were Korn, Kid Rock, Powerman 5000 &amp; System of a Down.
* In early January 2008, it was announced that the Missouri-Illinois Dodge Dealers would move their sponsorship from the NASCAR Craftsman Truck race to the NASCAR Nationwide Series race, and was called the Missouri-Illinois Dodge Dealers 250. At the 2008 event, Carl Edwards became the fourth driver to win two NASCAR Nationwide Series events at Gateway.
* 2008 marked a big year for the NHRA Midwest Nationals event at Gateway as legendary 16-time Funny Car Champion John Force secured his 1,000th competitive round win by defeating Ron Capps in the first round. Force accomplished the feat on his 59th birthday, making the milestone doubly special.
* The 2008 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Gateway was sponsored by Camping World, becoming the Camping World 200. Coincidentally, the race was won by defending Truck Series champion Ron Hornaday Jr. driving the No. 33 Camping World-sponsored truck for Kevin Harvick Inc.
* On the last lap of the July installment of the 2010 Nationwide Series race, during the height of their rivalry, Carl Edwards turned Brad Keselowski coming out of Turn 4 onto the front-stretch to take the checkered flag. Edwards was penalized 60 points and fined $25,000.
* In 2010, Gateway received a second Nationwide Series race due to the closure of Memphis Motorsports Park. The date was the former late fall event at Memphis. This was the last NASCAR event held at Gateway until 2014, as Dover Motorsports announced it would not seek sanctioning for the three events held at the track in 2010. The facility made no announcements concerning any of the other track&#x27;s events. The former Nashville Superspeedway received Gateway&#x27;s place on the schedule in July, while the race date for October would still be vacant. The NHRA also did not schedule any races at Gateway for its 2011 season.
* On November 3, 2010, Dover Motorsports announced that Gateway was officially closing and ceasing all racing operations. On September 8, 2011, it was officially announced that Gateway would re-open in 2012 and host the 15th AAA Insurance NHRA Midwest Nationals from September 28–30, under the leadership of Curtis Francois. On December 6, 2012, USAC announced that the track would have a USAC Traxxas Silver Crown Series date in 2013 on June 1.
* In February 2013, Francois announced the hiring of Chris Blair as Executive Vice President and General Manager. Furthermore, plans were announced for the addition of a world class karting facility (which opened as the Gateway Kartplex in June 2014), an off-road venue (which opened in May 2015 with a TORC Series event) and a revitalization plan for the track&#x27;s road course.
* On May 1, 2013, Curtis Francois finalized the purchase of Gateway Motorsports Park, officially making the facility locally owned and operated.
* On October 25, 2013, it was announced that the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series would be returning to Gateway on June 14, 2014, for the first time since 2010. Bubba Wallace won the first NASCAR event under the track&#x27;s new ownership.
* In October 2016, for the first time since the 2003 season, it was announced that the NTT IndyCar Series would be returning to Gateway on August 26, 2017, for the Bommarito Automotive Group 500. After IndyCar Series teams experienced issues with the surface during a May 2, 2017 open test on the oval, track officials undertook a multimillion-dollar renovation of the racing surface. The repaving project began June 19 and was completed in late July 2017.
* On April 17, 2019, World Wide Technology announced it had acquired naming rights for the track, renaming it to World Wide Technology Raceway.
* On June 26, 2019, a configuration of the road course was completed that utilizes Turns 1 &amp; 2 of the oval track. This added stretch of track was constructed directly in front of the Wallace Grandstand and its inception was partially created as a new course for Formula Drift and the SpeedTour TransAm Series.
* In late December 2019, WWT Raceway purchased the adjacent Gateway National Golf Links, a 7,178-yard links-style golf course.
* On August 21, 2021, due to the success of the event, it was announced before the green flag of the Bommarito Automotive Group 500 that the NTT IndyCar Series would be returning to the track for a renewed five-year contract. The 2021 edition also saw former F1 competitor Romain Grosjean make his first ever career oval track start. His debut attempt would result in a 14th-place finish in the Dale Coyne Racing w/ Rick Ware Racing #51 Honda, respectively.
* On September 15, 2021, it was announced WWT Raceway would be added to the NASCAR Cup Series schedule for the very first time for the 2022 season. Five thousand ticket deposits were placed within the first 24 hours of the announcement. The inaugural event was secured into the NASCAR Cup Series schedule for June 5, 2022. On March 14, 2022, the Illinois Office of Tourism was announced as the official sponsor of the event, naming the race the Enjoy Illinois 300. On June 1, 2022, WWT Raceway officially announced a capacity crowd sellout for the event, a first in track history.
* Soon after being awarded a NASCAR Cup Series date for the 2022 season, another $40 million worth of upgrades will be dedicated to the facility. One of the first enhancements was extending the Steel And Foam Energy Reduction (SAFER) barriers down a large length of the oval track&#x27;s backstretch wall. A request by NASCAR, this improvement meant the originally constructed &quot;bump out&quot; fencing down the back straightaway would be replaced with a swing gate, making the backstretch wall continuous. Other upgrades include a complete modernization of the oval track tower&#x27;s rooftop and suites, addition of infield camping sites, rejuvenated team areas, and remodeling of concession and midway spaces. The projects will occur in phases and are scheduled for completion by early 2025.
* At the conclusion of qualifying for the 2022 edition of the Bommarito Automotive Group 500, Will Power earned his 67th IndyCar pole position, tying him for most all-time with Mario Andretti. Josef Newgarden won the main event for a third time in a row—fourth time overall.
* On April 20, 2023, the Gateway Garage Experience was announced as the latest infield enhancement before the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series event. Directly located in-between the pit road and garage area, the Gateway Garage Experience provides fans an up-close look at teams with their drivers both in preparation and during the race.
* At the conclusion of the 2023 Bommarito Automotive Group 500, Scott Dixon won the race by a 22.2256 second margin of victory, shattering the previous record held by Juan Pablo Montoya with an 11.804 second margin of victory in 2000.
* During round 1 of the 2024 Enjoy Illinois 300 qualifying session on June 1, 2024, Michael McDowell set a new NASCAR Cup Series track record with a 32.318s (139.241 mph) lap time.
* On August 29, 2024, it was announced that the track&#x27;s NASCAR date would move from June to September and now be in the Round of 16 for the NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs. The NASCAR Xfinity Series will also make its return to the track in 2025 for the first time since 2010.

<text>Organogenesis is the phase of embryonic development that starts at the end of gastrulation and continues until birth. During organogenesis, the three germ layers formed from gastrulation (the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) form the internal organs of the organism. 

The cells of each of the three germ layers undergo differentiation, a process where less-specialized cells become more-specialized through the expression of a specific set of genes. Cell differentiation is driven by cell signaling cascades. Differentiation is influenced by extracellular signals such as growth factors that are exchanged to adjacent cells which is called juxtracrine signaling or to neighboring cells over short distances which is called paracrine signaling. Intracellular signals – a cell signaling itself (autocrine signaling) – also play a role in organ formation. These signaling pathways allow for cell rearrangement and ensure that organs form at specific sites within the organism. The organogenesis process can be studied using embryos and organoids.

== Organs produced by the germ layers ==

The endoderm is the inner most germ layer of the embryo which gives rise to gastrointestinal and respiratory organs by forming epithelial linings and organs such as the liver, lungs, and pancreas. The mesoderm or middle germ layer of the embryo will form the blood, heart, kidney, muscles, and connective tissues. The ectoderm or outermost germ layer of the developing embryo forms epidermis, the brain, and the nervous system.

== Mechanism of organ formation ==
While each germ layer forms specific organs, in the 1820s, embryologist Heinz Christian Pander discovered that the germ layers cannot form their respective organs without the cellular interactions from other tissues. In humans, internal organs begin to develop within 3–8 weeks after fertilization. The germ layers form organs by three processes: folds, splits, and condensation. Folds form in the germinal sheet of cells and usually form an enclosed tube which you can see in the development of vertebrates neural tube. Splits or pockets may form in the germinal sheet of cells forming vesicles or elongations. The lungs and glands of the organism may develop this way.

A primary step in organogenesis for chordates is the development of the notochord, which induces the formation of the neural plate, and ultimately the neural tube in vertebrate development. The development of the neural tube will give rise to the brain and spinal cord. Vertebrates develop a neural crest that differentiates into many structures, including bones, muscles, and components of the central nervous system. Differentiation of the ectoderm into the neural crest, neural tube, and surface ectoderm is sometimes referred to as neurulation and the embryo in this phase is the neurula. The coelom of the body forms from a split of the mesoderm along the somite axis

== Plant organogenesis ==
In plants, organogenesis occurs continuously and only stops when the plant dies. In the shoot, the shoot apical meristems regularly produce new lateral organs (leaves or flowers) and lateral branches. In the root, new lateral roots form from weakly differentiated internal tissue (e.g. the xylem-pole pericycle in the model plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;). &quot;In vitro&quot; and in response to specific cocktails of hormones (mainly auxins and cytokinins), most plant tissues can de-differentiate and form a mass of dividing totipotent stem cells called a callus. Organogenesis can then occur from those cells. The type of organ that is formed depends on the relative concentrations of the hormones in the medium. Plant organogenesis can be induced in tissue culture and used to regenerate plants.

<text>Robert Franklin Palmer Jr. (June 19, 1945 – November 20, 1997) was an American writer, musicologist, clarinetist, saxophonist, and blues producer. He is best known for his non-fictional writing on the field of music; his work as a music journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine; his production work for blues recordings (including the soundtrack for the film &quot;Deep Blues&quot;); and his clarinet playing as a member of the 1960s jazz band the Insect Trust.

==Early career==
Robert Franklin Palmer Jr. was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, the son of a musician and school teacher, Robert Palmer Sr. 

A civil rights and peace activist with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, Palmer Jr. graduated from Little Rock University (later called the University of Arkansas at Little Rock) in 1964. Soon afterward he and fellow musicians Nancy Jeffries, Bill Barth, and Luke Faust formed a psychedelic music group, the Insect Trust, blending jazz, folk, and blues with rock and roll. The band recorded its first, self-titled album on Capitol Records in 1968. Palmer continued playing clarinet and saxophone from time to time in local bands in areas where he lived throughout the rest of his life.

==Later period==
In the early 1970s, Palmer became a contributing editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and worked as a journalist for film magazines. He became the first full-time rock writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, serving as chief pop music critic at the newspaper from 1976 to 1988. According to National Public Radio, Palmer was the New York Times&#x27;s &quot;first full-time rock writer&quot;. 

In 1985, he was recruited by friends Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood to play clarinet on the song &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; by U2&#x27;s Bono for the Artists United Against Apartheid album &quot;Sun City&quot;.

Palmer began teaching courses in ethnomusicology and American music at colleges, including at the University of Mississippi. In the early 1990s, he started producing blues albums for Fat Possum Records artists, such as R. L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough. Following a residence from 1988 through 1992 near Memphis, he spent about six months at a country estate near Little Rock before finally relocating in early 1993 to New Orleans, Louisiana, his home until his death.

He worked as screenwriter, narrator, and music director of two documentary films &quot;The World According to John Coltrane&quot; (that he also directed, with Toby Byron) and &quot;Deep Blues&quot; (based on his book by the same name). He was heavily involved in the 1995 WGBH/BBC co-production &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, broadcast in the United States in late 1995 on PBS.

==Works==
===Literary works===
Two of his better-known books are the historical study &quot;Deep Blues&quot; (Penguin, 1982) and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll: An Unruly History&quot; (Harmony, 1995), the latter of which was the companion book to the ten-part BBC and PBS television documentary series &quot;Rock &amp; Roll &quot;(aka Dancing in the Street)&quot;&quot; on which he served as chief consultant. He wrote a book about Jerry Lee Lewis, titled &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis Rocks&quot;. A collection of his writings entitled &quot;Blues &amp; Chaos: The Music Writing of Robert Palmer&quot;, edited by Anthony DeCurtis, was posthumously published by Simon &amp; Schuster on November 10, 2009.

==Death and legacy==
Palmer died from liver disease at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, New York, on November 20, 1997.

His daughter, Augusta Palmer, directed a documentary called &quot;The Hand of Fatima&quot; (2009) about Palmer&#x27;s lifelong relationship with the Master Musicians of Jajouka.

<text>Homestead–Miami Speedway (formerly known as the Homestead Motorsports Complex from 1995 to 1998) is a oval-shaped intermediate speedway in Homestead, Florida. It has hosted various major auto racing series throughout its existence, including NASCAR, IndyCar, and FIA GT Championship. The facility has a capacity of 43,000 as of 2019. Along with the main oval track, the facility features a road course layout that uses parts of the oval along with a specially designed infield road course. Homestead–Miami Speedway is currently owned by the city of Homestead, operated by NASCAR, and is led by track president Guillermo Santa Cruz. 

Seeking a permanent venue for the Grand Prix of Miami, auto racing promoter Ralph Sanchez initiated plans to build a complex in 1991. After numerous failed proposals, the city of Homestead, recovering from the effects of Hurricane Andrew, was able to woo Sanchez into building the permanent complex within the city and was completed by 1995. In the following four years, the city of Homestead and Sanchez made numerous accommodations to then-NASCAR president Bill France Jr. to gain a NASCAR Cup Series race weekend, including the reconfiguration of the track from a rectangle to an oval-shaped track in 1997. In the 2000s, numerous renovations were made to the track, including a second reconfiguration, the installation of SAFER barriers and lights, and other amenities.

==Description==

===Configuration===
The complex&#x27;s oval layout in its current form is measured at , with a progressive system of banking of 18–20° in the turns and 4° of banking on the track&#x27;s straights. The complex also features a , 11-turn &quot;roval&quot; layout that uses parts of the oval along with a specially designed infield road course. From 1997–2003, the oval layout featured a banking of 6° in the turns and 3° in the straights. 

When the complex was first built, it featured a rectangle-shaped layout similar in shape to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway alongside a , 13-turn road course layout that utilized parts of the rectangle along with specially designed parts of the track that were contained within the track&#x27;s infield. The rectangle&#x27;s layout distance was disputed by sanctioning bodies; NASCAR used a length of , and Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) used a length of . 

===Amenities===

Homestead–Miami Speedway is served by U.S. Route 1 and Florida State Road 821, and covers approximately according to the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. As of 2019, the facility has a capacity of 43,000 according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. Within the track&#x27;s infield is a deep, by lake that is occasionally used for fishing tournaments along with a , two-story media center that was constructed in 2008. The facility also features an art deco aesthetic made by Day One that combines &quot;aqua blue, tan, and purple&quot; according to &quot;Yahoo Sports&quot;&#x27; Jay Busbee. 

==Track history==

===Planning and construction===

====Failed Munisport proposal====
On March 27, 1991, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; made public that Grand Prix of Miami promoter Ralph Sanchez sought to build a permanent racing facility in Miami-Dade County, Florida, submitting a bill through the Florida Legislature that proposed that a local tourist tax would expand to let the tax be used to fund motorsports facilities. According to the &quot;Herald&quot;, he asked for up to $20 million in tax money to build the facility. The bill had passed earlier in the Florida House of Representatives on the 21st. Sanchez wanted to seek out a permanent facility for the Grand Prix of Miami, which had been run as a street course on city streets. Three days after the initial report, the &quot;Herald&quot; reported that Sanchez was considering a location at Amelia Earhart Park; the plan faced heavy opposition from nearby residents. The bill later passed the Florida Senate in May of that year. In December, Florida legislators voted over a budget proposal of $48.5 million to various sports and events in the Miami area; within the proposal was a plan to give $9 million to Sanchez to build the permanent facility. Sanchez wanted as much as $25 million, but local government leaders cut the amount down. The proposal was approved on the 19th; with the $9 million, Sanchez stated that he aimed to use the money to improve amenities on the street course.

By May 1992, Sanchez began considering a proposal to build a racetrack on the Munisport landfill in North Miami, proposing to build the track in two phases. A noise test for nearby residents was conducted the following month, with the proposal receiving mixed, highly polarizing reactions from residents who either supported or opposed the facility. The North Miami City Council approved the proposal on June 26, with Sanchez later stating hopes to host CART IndyCar World Series races. In response, a group of approximately 90 people who opposed the project was formed: the Citizens for the Public Use of Munisport. The group argued that the land was designated to be used as public land according to a referendum voted on by local citizens more than 20 years before the approval. Opposition towards the proposal grew heavily by September, with multiple cities stating their opposition to the project. On October 18, the &quot;Herald&quot; reported that the Munisport proposal was officially dead, with Sanchez stating to the &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;with the opposition mounting in North Miami, we were feeling a little unwanted.&quot;

====Homestead proposal, construction====
On October 4, in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew and in midst of the confirmation of the sale of the Villages of Homestead real estate project, Homestead City Manager Alex Muxo stated his hopes to woo Sanchez into building his motorsports complex in Homestead. 11 days later, Muxo stated in a press conference that Sanchez had agreed to build the complex east of the Homestead Sports Complex, with the Metro-Dade Finance Committee promising $11 million for the project. The committee&#x27;s investment was approved in November, with Sanchez stating that with the approval, &quot;we can start to build almost right away.&quot; Another $1.7 million investment was given by the Homestead City Council in February 1993. However, three months later, the project was put into jeopardy when a real estate deal was delayed when Homestead Properties, the owner of approximately of prospective land the city of Homestead looked to buy, was sued for alleged misuse of insurance funds. In addition, Sanchez stated in July that &quot;soil conditions and flood criteria requirements&quot; as potential causes for a possible delay.

On July 27, 1993, the Metro-Dade Commission approved the use of $20 million in hotel taxes to invest into the facility, more than half of the budget Sanchez needed for the project; with the approval, Sanchez acquired a total of $31 million for the project. By this point, plans for the facility included 9,000 permanent seats and restaurants. In August, plans for the complex were officially unveiled: the complex planned to include two oval tracks and the original road course, with Sanchez hoping to host IndyCar, IMSA, Trans-Am Series, Formula One, and NASCAR races at the facility. 

Groundbreaking occurred within the month on the 24th, with NASCAR president Bill France Jr. appearing as a dignitary. Eight days later, construction was halted after numerous environmental groups and agencies pressured Muxo and the city of Homestead to stop clearing land over concerns of a lack of environmental permits. As a result, the $20 million promised by the Metro-Dade Commission was temporarily blocked and the initial announced opening of November 1994 was delayed. On February 24, 1994, Sanchez stated in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; that he hoped construction would resume the following week; however, new complaints from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service arose the following month. In May, construction resumed on the complex after the city of Homestead was able to obtain all the permits needed to resume construction, ending an eight-month delay. Two months later, the projected cost for the project increased by approximately $6 million, leading developers to &quot;temporarily&quot; scale back the project by removing grandstands for the track&#x27;s first race. The track&#x27;s first confirmed event was announced in September, with a race weekend highlighted by a NASCAR Busch Series race scheduled to christen the track from November 3–5, 1995.

Financial troubles continued throughout the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995. In October, the city of Homestead began to consider selling bonds to finance construction, drafting a sale in December. County oversight was also sought to be greatly increased by November, with the budget for the project approaching $50 million. By April 1995, track developers still owed approximately $11 million to various contractors, with Homestead mayor Ted DeMilly stating in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; that &quot;not only don&#x27;t we have a lot of money, but we have a real time crunch.&quot; The following month, businessman Wayne Huizenga offered a $20 million loan to cover the track&#x27;s remaining deficits in exchange for a minority ownership of the complex. By July, the project&#x27;s cost increased to an expected $58 million; however, despite the increased costs, the Dade County commission received criticism for not providing bond issues to help fund the track. By the end of the track&#x27;s initial construction, plans for the track included 65,000 total seats, 70 condominiums, and an oval track layout similar to the layout of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, with a final projected cost of $59 million (adjusted for inflation, $).

===First years, oval reconfiguration===

The first tire tests on the facility were conducted by Busch Series driver Chad Little on August 9, 1995, with Little praising the track&#x27;s oval layout. Multi-car tests were run two months later; although consistent praise for the track&#x27;s oval layout was given, numerous drivers crashed during the session, including one that injured driver Mike Harmon with a fractured left leg. The first race run at the facility on November 4, with Dexter Canipe winning a NASCAR Goody&#x27;s Dash Series race. The track&#x27;s first highlight race occurred the following day, with a crowd of 65,000 watching Dale Jarrett win a Busch Series race. After the weekend, the track&#x27;s surface drew criticism from numerous Busch Series drivers for being too slippery outside of the regular racing line; in response to the criticism, Sanchez pledged to fix the issue by placing down polymer on the track&#x27;s surface. On March 3, 1996, the complex held its first open-wheel race at the facility, with Jimmy Vasser winning a Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) event.

After the facility&#x27;s first CART race weekend, track developers announced the repaving of all four corners due to concerns of a lack of passing, with the corners being widened. The repaving was completed by September of that year; the new track surface drew concerns over the track being too fast for open-wheel racing. After a Busch Series race in November, the track still received criticism by drivers and reporters for a lack of passing. At the same time, Sanchez began initiating plans to obtain a NASCAR Winston Cup Series (now known as the NASCAR Cup Series) date. According to &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, $17 million worth of renovations were made to the facility in 1996, which focused on adding bathrooms, hospitality centers, and television screens. The following year, Sanchez announced plans in March to reconfigure the rectangle track into an oval-shaped track at a cost of $8 million, with Sanchez stating that if they did not reconfigure the track, &quot;there is no chance we&#x27;ll get a Winston Cup race.&quot; That same month, the facility oversaw its first fatality when NASCAR driver John Nemechek suffered brain injuries from a crash during a NASCAR Truck Series race. Construction on the reconfiguration started on March 24 and was completed by November for the track&#x27;s annual Busch Series race. 

===International Speedway Corporation buyout, conflict with city of Homestead, 2000s renovations===
In further efforts to lure a Winston Cup race, attempts were made to make NASCAR president Bill France Jr. a partner for the Miami Motorsports group that leased the track from the city of Homestead; however, the talks broke down by March 1997. However, by the following month, the city of Homestead voted on changing the lease to allow an option to let the France family purchase Miami Motorsports; it was approved on April 7. By July, talks to convince France Jr. to become a partner of Miami Motorsports resumed, officially announcing on the 23rd that the France family-owned International Speedway Corporation (ISC) and the Roger Penske-owned Penske Motorsports each bought out a 40% share of Miami Motorsports, with Sanchez and Huizenga each retaining 10% ownership. Sanchez stepped down from day-to-day operations in November, with Brian Skuza being appointed as general manager of the track. In March 1998, Sanchez&#x27;s ownership was bought out, with ISC and Penske Motorsports each increasing their ownership to 45%. In September, Skuza officially announced the confirmation of a Winston Cup Series date for 1999. In order to accommodate a Cup Series race weekend, the facility was upgraded to hold 71,763 permanent seats; an addition of 21,000. In July 1999, the facility underwent a rebranding, with the facility being renamed as the Homestead–Miami Speedway. That same month, ISC bought out Penske Motorsports, with ISC gaining a 90% stake over Miami Motorsports. As part of the move, Skuza was replaced by executive vice president Curtis Gray as president of the track. In September 2001, ISC bought out Huizenga&#x27;s share of Homestead–Miami Speedway, LLC, taking over full control of the lease. 

By 2001, the city of Homestead was reported to have lost $34–51 million on potential profit on the track since 1999 due to the city changing its lease agreements to obtain a Cup Series date, with &quot;Miami Herald&quot; writer Carl Hiaasen stating that due to the decision to change the city&#x27;s lease agreement with ISC, &quot;with one baffling stroke of the pen, Homestead agreed that it would take no share of its own speedway&#x27;s profits, even if the NASCAR races were wildly successful.&quot; In response to criticism, Gray stated that the track was not obligated to pay taxes to the city despite a Supreme Court of Florida ruling to end the track&#x27;s property tax exemption and that the facility was a &quot;viable entity&quot; for the city of Homestead despite the city of Homestead blaming their financial crisis on the track&#x27;s lease agreement. Gray later stated that critics of the facility and the lease agreement were &quot;misinformed and looking for a scapegoat.&quot; 

In 2002, the facility experienced its second fatality when driver Jeff Clinton was decapitated when he crashed during a practice session for a Grand American Sports Car race. The following year in April, track leaders began considering a reconfiguration to increasing the banking on the track&#x27;s turns due to complaints from drivers that passing other drivers on the track was too difficult. The $10 million reconfiguration was officially announced the following month, with the track&#x27;s turns being reconfigured to a variable banking system of 18–20°. Along with the reconfiguration, the addition of soft wall SAFER barriers were announced to increase driver safety. The reconfiguration was completed in time for the 2003 Ford 400 in November and received positive reactions from drivers and NASCAR officials. In 2004, Gray announced his consideration of installing lights to accommodate nighttime racing at the facility. After approval was given by the United States Air Force, the plan was officially confirmed in April 2005 with a budget of approximately $8 million; the project was completed by November. Two months after the announcement, the construction of the $14 million Turn One Tower, a luxury seating section, was announced. In 2006, the track&#x27;s third fatality occurred when IndyCar driver Paul Dana died in a practice crash for the 2006 Toyota Indy 300. Two years later, track officials announced the construction of a new $8 million media center. 

===Capacity decline, leadership changes===
In 2009, Gray stepped down from his position as president, with Matthew Becherer being named as Gray&#x27;s replacement. Two years later, track officials began lobbying for an expansion that would add 12,000 seats and other improvements to the facility. Although the proposal was approved by July of that year, by 2014, the track was reported by ISC to have decreased to 46,000 seats according to Bob Pockrass of &quot;Sporting News&quot;. By 2019, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; Dave Caldwell, the facility decreased its seating capacity to 43,000. That same year, NASCAR bought out ISC in October, taking control of the lease for the track; a month later, Becherer left his position as president, being replaced by senior vice president of operations of Homestead–Miami Speedway, Al Garcia. Garcia retained his position until 2024, when he was replaced by Guillermo Santa Cruz.

====NASCAR====
As of 2024, the track hosts one annual NASCAR weekend: the Straight Talk Wireless 400. First run in 1999, the race became the final event of the Cup Series season in 2002. It stayed as the finale until 2019, when the season finale for all three series was moved to the NASCAR-owned Phoenix Raceway in 2020. Starting in 2025, the NASCAR race weekend at the track is scheduled to return to a March date, moving away from its current spot in the playoffs. Additionally, the second-tier Xfinity Series and third-tier Truck Series also race at the facility as support races for the Cup Series, with both originally making their debuts as highlight races in 1995.

====Open-wheel racing====

Starting in 1996, the Grand Prix of Miami was moved from a street course based in Miami to then-named Homestead Motorsports Complex, with Jimmy Vasser winning the first open-wheel event at the facility. Until 2000, the event was sanctioned by Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART); CART failed to renew to 2001, with the Indy Racing League (IRL) taking over sanctioning rights for the event. In 2009, the race moved from being the season opener to the season finale for the IRL. The series failed to renew for the 2011 season, ending a 17-year tenure at the track. 

In 2025, Formula E is scheduled to make their debut at the facility for the Miami ePrix, racing on the facility&#x27;s road course.

<text>Justin Mapp (born October 18, 1984) is an American former soccer player who played as a midfielder. Mapp has been described as being versatile and known for possessing &quot;speed and creative abilities from out wide, but also his ability to drift inside and generate offense.&quot;

==Career==

===Professional===
Mapp graduated from the Bradenton Academy in 2001 and signed with MLS as a Project-40 player. He was drafted by D.C. United with the fourth overall pick in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft, but played only 28 minutes for DC in his first year as a pro. The Chicago Fire acquired Mapp for Dema Kovalenko before the 2003 season, and he has been an important player in the squad since, helping them to the 2003 US Open Cup. In two seasons with the Fire, Mapp scored six goals and added seven assists.

After eight years with Chicago, Mapp was traded to Philadelphia Union on July 26, 2010, in exchange for allocation money. Mapp won &quot;MLS Player of the Week&quot; honors in Week 11 of the 2011 season for his 2-goal performance in the club&#x27;s 6–2 win against Toronto FC. This performance earned the recognition of the North American Soccer Reporters society. One of his goals was even nominated for the MLS Goal of the Week award. On June 8, Mapp was named a nominee for the MLS All-Star Game. On June 28, he was said to be leading in text voting for the All-Star Game.

After a season and a half with Philadelphia, Mapp was selected by expansion franchise Montreal Impact in the 2011 MLS Expansion Draft on November 23, 2011. He said he was surprised to be unprotected by the Union. On May 29, 2013, Mapp was awarded the 2013 George Gross Memorial Trophy for his play in the Canadian Championship, leading Montreal to victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the final. A year later, he claimed the award again after Montreal defeated Toronto FC in the 2014 final making him one of only two players, the other being Dwayne De Rosario, to win the award twice.

After his contract expired following the 2015 season, Mapp signed with Sporting Kansas City, becoming the first free agent signing in MLS history. He played six times for Kansas before retiring at the end of 2017.

===International===
Mapp has played for various youth United States national teams, including the 2001 Under-17 World Championship in Trinidad and Tobago. He started all five matches for the U.S. in the 2003 World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates. Mapp made his debut for the senior team on October 12, 2005, against Panama. Mapp also came on as a sub January 20, 2007, against Denmark, running 70 yards with the ball before setting up Jonathan Bornstein&#x27;s game-winning goal. He also played for USA in Copa América 2007.

<doc id="1184884" wikidata="Q5072032" url="?curid=1184884" title="Changing Rooms">
<text>Changing Rooms is a do-it-yourself home improvement show broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC between 1996 and 2004. The series was revived on Channel 4 in 2021.

The show was one of a number of home improvement and lifestyle shows popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show was later franchised, generally under the same name, for the local TV markets in the United States, New Zealand and Australia.

==Format==
The premise of the show was for couples to swap houses with friends or neighbours with each pair decorating one room in each other&#x27;s homes. This leads up to a finale with both couples seeing their rooms, and meeting up again – almost invariably on still friendly terms. With the show including some top designers, their ideas could be a little over the top, which led to a few tears and tantrums.

==History==
The show began on BBC Two, at 9 pm on 4 September 1996, before transferring to BBC One for the start of the third series in 1998. The final edition was broadcast on 22 November 2004 after a successful 8-year, 17 series run. The cancellation was announced on 27 August 2004.

&quot;Changing Rooms&quot; was originally hosted by Carol Smillie, and assisting with the remodelling was a Cockney carpenter, &quot;Handy&quot; Andy Kane. The former designer on the show, Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, took over presenting the show from Smillie in 2003 for series 14 and 15. &quot;Handy&quot; Andy went on to host his own DIY shows.

In November 2004, a special episode was taped in Boscastle, Cornwall, for Christmas broadcast. Designers Anna Ryder Richardson, Graham Wynne and Gordon Whistance took on the task of restoring the decor of homes and businesses damaged in the floods of August that year. The episode was broadcast on 28 December 2004.

In October 2020, Channel 4 announced that it would be reviving the show, with Llewelyn-Bowen returning as presenter alongside Davina McCall. On 22 March 2021, it was confirmed that McCall would not present the revived series due to scheduling conflicts and the delayed filming of the show as a result of coronavirus restrictions. On 5 May 2021, Anna Richardson was confirmed as McCall&#x27;s replacement.

==Designers==
The designers on the original version during its run included:

*Linda Barker
*Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen
*Anna Ryder Richardson
==International versions==
The show has been franchised and variations of it appear in several other countries, sometimes with a different name – such as &quot;Trading Spaces&quot; in United States. The original &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; is also broadcast overseas, for example, on BBC America and featured in various US shows, the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode &quot;Lights, Camera, Relationship&quot; being one example.

A New Zealand edition of the show was produced for several years, also called &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;. It was identically formatted to the British series, with host Kerry Smith, &quot;Handy&quot; Andy Dye, and regular designers including Donald Grant Sunderland, Neil McLachlan and Sally Ridge. A handful of international shows were produced, each featuring one couple in New Zealand and one in the United Kingdom.

Australia&#x27;s Nine Network also produced a local version of &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; from 1998 to 2005, hosted by Suzie Wilks who was assisted by Peter Everett, James Lindsay, Catherine Morton and Tim Janenko-Panaeff.

In the Netherlands, a Dutch version – In Holland staat een huis – was broadcast by RTL 4 from 1998 to 2006, hosted by Martijn Krabbé.

<doc id="1184888" wikidata="Q1723946" url="?curid=1184888" title="Kansas Speedway">
<text>Kansas Speedway (formerly known as Kansas International Speedway in initial planning and construction stages) is a tri-oval intermediate speedway in Kansas City, Kansas. The track, since its inaugural season of racing in 2001, has hosted a variety of racing series, including NASCAR, IndyCar, and the IMSA SportsCar Championship. The track has a 48,000-seat capacity as of 2019. Within oval exists an infield road course that is used with the oval to make a &quot;roval&quot;. The Speedway is adjacent to the Hollywood Casino, which opened in 2012 and is a joint venture by Penn Entertainment and the track. The venue is currently owned by NASCAR and is led by track president Patrick Warren.

As part of the construction boom of oval tracks in the 1990s, the International Speedway Corporation (ISC) sought to build a track in the Midwest. In 1997, ISC announced plans to build a track in the Kansas City metropolitan area, eventually building it in Wyandotte County, Kansas. Although the track was scheduled to open in 2000, the track faced multiple lawsuits by homeowners who lived in the area, pushing its construction back by months and delaying its opening to 2001. Since 2001, the track has remained in some form within the NASCAR calendar.

== Description ==

=== Configurations ===
The speedway in its current form is measured at , with the track having a progressive banking system in the turns. Subsequently, the track has 17 degrees of banking at the track&#x27;s bottom lane, and 20 degrees of banking at the track&#x27;s top lane in the turns. The frontstretch has 10 degrees of banking, and the backstretch has 5 degrees of banking. Different measurements of length have been used; IndyCar has utilized a length of for its races.

Within the track&#x27;s infield, there is an infield road course that is connected to the main oval track to create a &quot;roval&quot;. During the track&#x27;s construction in 2000, then-track president Grant Lynch stated that initial plans for the track included an infield road course. The road course was constructed in 2012 as part of renovations made to the track. The road course is long, with the infield portion of the course having six turns. 

=== Amenities ===
The track is served by numerous major roads. The track is next to an intersection of the concurrent Interstate 70, U.S. Route 24, and U.S. Route 40, and Interstate 435. At the time of the track&#x27;s construction, the complex covered 1,250 acres, had a capacity of around 75,000, and had 65 rows of grandstand seating. As of 2019, the track has a current capacity of 48,000, down from its previous 64,000 according to annual reports from ISC. At its peak, the track had a capacity of 82,000, which occurred in the mid-2000s.

==== Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway ====

The Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway was approved in 2009 after an initial failed attempt by the track and the Cordish Corporation the previous year. The casino is a joint venture by the track and Penn Entertainment, who bought out Cordish. The casino overlooks the track&#x27;s second turn, features a 268,000 square foot complex, and is themed after the Hollywood area in Los Angeles, California. The casino opened in February 2012.

== Track history ==

=== Initial bids, planning ===
As part of the oval track construction boom in the 1990s, in December 1996, the International Speedway Corporation (ISC) announced preliminary plans to find a location to build a $100 million, 120,000-seat capacity track. An official for ISC, John Story, mentioned that the Kansas City metropolitan area was a suitable area that the company was looking at. In addition, the project was supported by the Kansas City Area Development Council. An initial bid by the city of Gardner, Kansas, was made in February 1997; however, the plan met local opposition and the city eventually backtracked after city officials witnessed the 1997 Daytona 500, realizing that building it in Gardner would be too close to already existing residential development along with heavy traffic congestion. By April, ISC narrowed down their selected sites to 16, which included plots in Platte County, Missouri and Wyandotte County, Kansas.

The next month, ISC was considering using a plot of land near Interstate 29 near the Kansas City International Airport. By July, ISC announced that the Kansas City area was their &quot;No. 1&quot; choice to build the track, asking the area to pay for the track. Three locations were then narrowed down: one in Missouri with the previously mentioned land near Interstate 29, and two locations in Kansas; one plot near Interstate 70 and Interstate 435, and one plot near 110th Street and Parallel Parkway. Officials from both Kansas and Missouri both went to ISC&#x27;s headquarters to try and convince ISC to build the track in their respective areas, with the project drawing relatively positive public support. By mid-August, Wyandotte County officials entered negotiations with ISC, with local county agencies giving &quot;heavy support&quot; for the project. At the end of negotiations in October, the plot of land near I-70 and I-435 was chosen, with initial plans stating to sit 75,000 with room to expand to 150,000. The track&#x27;s budget stated amounted to almost $200 million. The track&#x27;s construction was scheduled to start in the spring of 1998 and was scheduled to be finished sometime in 2000.

Guarantee of a NASCAR Winston Cup race weekend was not given, with the NASCAR Winston Cup Series schedule experiencing growth in the 1990s; a &quot;radical plan&quot; was predicted to be needed in order to get a Winston Cup race weekend. When final negotiations were completed, the project cost later increased to over $252 million, with ISC being offered a tax break until 2027 barring a change in Kansas law; a proposed bill planned to extend the abatement period from 20 years to 30. The tax breaks sparked debates in the Kansas legislature over the length of tax breaks. After passing through both the Kansas House of Representatives and the Kansas Senate, the tax breaks were signed by Bill Graves, the Governor of Kansas.

==== Lawsuits, delays ====
With the purchase of the land from ISC, 146 homeowners along with some property managers were affected by the purchase. As a result, the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City made incentive offers to get homeowners to move out of the area. In April, a lawsuit was filed by 11 homeowners to stop ISC and Unified from buying any property, stating that the defendants did not have a final plan to start buying property. By July, the government was considering using the power of eminent domain, with local Kansas law declaring that condemnation could be used if the area is within a &quot;major tourism district&quot;. On July 10, the Kansas Supreme Court unanimously decided with ISC and Unified, basing their opinion with the Fifth Amendment in their ruling. Residents then decided to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States on July 20.

Nine days later, another lawsuit was filed by 13 property owners over insufficient relocation and moving packages. As a result of the lawsuit, the purchase of $95 million of revenue bonds was delayed until the lawsuit was resolved, leading to a potential delay in opening. In response, ISC and Unified made efforts to buy up property for a combined total of around $13 million, with the issue considered settled. However, in September, Donna L. Laughery, a property owner, filed another lawsuit on the basis that she wanted to &quot;learn terms of all contract agreements with property owners&quot; according to her lawyer, accusing the defendants of incentive payments being made out in a discriminatory manner. Attorney Nick Tomasic sought to get the Kansas Supreme Court to directly hear the case to prevent any further delays; however, this was declined by the Kansas Supreme Court. By mid-October, although most residents were expected to move out by the end of the month and ISC was expected to own most of the property needed, the actual construction was still uncertain. A summary judgement was later granted at the end of October, and in November, the case was dismissed. In January 1999, $95.6 million worth of bonds were sold, officially resuming the project. However, an opening date for the track was not stated by Lesa France Kennedy, the executive vice president of ISC.

=== Construction ===

Although construction had started several months earlier in September, the project was delayed to the point where chances of an opening date in 2000 were &quot;very small&quot; according to ISC&#x27;s Grant Lynch. In addition, in sentiments shared by Las Vegas Motor Speedway&#x27;s Jeff Motley and Texas Motor Speedway&#x27;s Eddie Gossage, the probability of getting a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race weekend for Kansas International Speedway became increasingly smaller with new dates given out in 1997 and 1998. However, by the end of February, NASCAR&#x27;s Mike Helton indicated hopes of hosting a race at Kansas; a month later, NASCAR president Bill France Jr. &quot;virtually guaranteed&quot; a race weekend, planning for a race weekend in 2001. Two months later, the Indy Racing League (IRL) announced future races at the track for 2001. By July, although the project experienced further delays due to weather, the track started to sell tickets, with demand being so high that the project&#x27;s leaders were considering to expand their initial capacity and amount of suites. Within the next two months, the track considered adding Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) races and selling naming rights in wake of Charlotte Motor Speedway doing the same earlier in the year. Officials later stated hope of opening the track for private testing in the fall of 2000.

Despite the delays, construction was viewed with &quot;high hopes&quot; by ISC, with the final budget for the track being touted as $287 million in November 1999. In May, officials stated hopes of an official date for its NASCAR Winston Cup Series race weekend within the month; this was later confirmed on May 8, when both IRL and NASCAR&#x27;s race weekend dates were revealed, with the race weekends being held on July 8 and September 29–30, respectively; the next month, the track considered getting a third race weekend for 2001. Later companion races were announced for IRL were announced on August 1 and September 29, respectively. In September, the track starting paving. Two months later, the track&#x27;s opening date was moved back to June 2, 2001, with a new race weekend for ARCA and the NASCAR Winston West Series being announced. By February 2001, a new $236.6 million retail outlet development was announced to be built upon 250 acres of land surrounding the track, with an opening date slated for 2002. In April, the first testing runs were made by ARCA driver Ryan Newman.

Aside from the initial criticism and lawsuits from some local residents, the project was met with optimism throughout construction. According to &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, a firm associated with the track predicted a &quot;one-time&quot; event&#x27;s revenue to rake in $12.8 million in tax revenue, with $6.1 million in the years following after. In a groundbreaking celebration on May 25, 1999, the track received positive reviews from drivers Bobby Labonte, Rusty Wallace, and Ken Schrader. In March 2000, when local Kansas lawmakers visited the track, the track drew praise from state senators Nancey Harrington and Ben Vidricksen. By August 2000, 80% of tickets were sold for its NASCAR Winston Cup Series race. In October, the track was projected by the local city sports council to generate $2.28 billion to the local economy by 2003.

=== Early years ===
The track opened to the public as scheduled on June 2, 2001, with ARCA driver Jason Jarrett winning the first race at the track. The first ever NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and Indy Racing League doubleheader followed a month later, with Ricky Hendrick and Eddie Cheever winning their respective races. In September, the track was able to hold its first Winston Cup Series race, with Jeff Gordon winning the inaugural event. The next year, Lynch stepped down from his position, giving control of the track to vice president Jeff Boerger. The track later expanded to include over 80,000 grandstand seats in November. Two years later, the track expanded to 83,000 seats; although 150,000 seats were expected, an uncertain economy led to the track&#x27;s leaders taking a conservative approach on expansion.

=== Hollywood Casino&#x27;s beginnings ===
==== Battle for state-owned casino bid ====
Starting in 2004, proposals by the Kickapoo tribe and the Sac and Fox Nation to build a state-regulated casino at a budget of $210 million west of the track were made to the Kansas Legislature. The proposal to allow state-run casinos faced heavy opposition from several businessmen and lobbying groups, stating that the casino&#x27;s revenue under the bill was too low along with chances of potential government corruption. By March 2005, Doug Mays, speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives, declared that the tribes&#x27; compact was killed in the current session unless they allowed the state to inspect slot machines.

Within the next two years, four more proposals were made. In 2007, another proposal was made in a joint venture by the track and the Cordish Corporation to compete with five other proposals that planned to build near the area, including competition from Las Vegas Sands and Pinnacle Entertainment. With this, the Unified Government opted to hear all proposals by the end of the year, with all proposals having varying budgets. The track later stated that their 500-room hotel and casino would cost around $600 million. In October, a seventh proposal was added, along with the track proposal stating that no eminent domain land would be used. By December, the government heard three proposals. The project later received criticism from government watchdog group Americans For Prosperity-Kansas for being too related and being funded by revenue bonds or prior tax financing; something the group argued was illegal under Kansas law. By March 2008, the group filed a lawsuit in the Kansas Supreme Court against the state-owned Kansas Lottery claiming that the project would &quot;create an illegal tax&quot;; however, the law itself was viewed itself as &quot;extremely murky&quot; by &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; writer Rick Alm on whether the law&#x27;s wording was retroactive. The next month, Las Vegas Sands opted to submit their proposal despite Kansas Lottery refusing to hear it.

In May, Kansas Lottery approved five proposals in Wyandotte County. On June 27, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that state-owned casinos were constitutional, resuming the bid for a casino near the track. Two months later, Lesa France Kennedy endorsed the track&#x27;s bid, adding the promise of a second NASCAR Cup Series race weekend if the Kansas government chose the track&#x27;s proposal. The next month, the track promised the addition of an infield road course if they were selected. Three days before the decision, Pinnacle withdrew their proposal as part of consequences of Unified Government officials appearing in a promotional video along with stagnation in the United States&#x27; economy. On September 19, Kansas Lottery gave the track and the Cordish Corporation their approval to build a $705 million casino branded under the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino name.

==== Casino delays ====
The first phase of opening was slated for a June 2009 date; however, this was later slated to sometime later in the year. In addition, the Cordish Corporation threatened to end their partnership due to a local Kansas City proposed law banning indoor smoking, but they later backtracked the threat; the city later gave exemptions to the casino for smoking. However, in December, as part of consequences due to the Great Recession, the partnership backed out, with the partnership hoping to reapply in the near future when the economy rose. In January, the partnership announced plans to resubmit their proposal by April 1. On March 31, the decision was confirmed, with the partnership now having to go against two other proposals: one from Penn Entertainment and one from Golden Heartland. By May, the Kansas Speedway partnership and Penn Entertainment&#x27;s proposals managed to advance further into the planning stages. Due to the Great Recession and its effects, both proposals, which initially had budgets of over $600 million, were cut to around $350 million for both proposals.

In September, the two proposals essentially merged into one when Penn Entertainment bought out the Cordish Corporation. As a result of the buyout, the Hard Rock branding was scrapped in favor of a Hollywood-themed casino, with an approval decision for the new $521 million proposal to come in December. Despite being the only proposal left, the Kansas Lottery stated that they would not become a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for the proposal despite renewed promises of a second NASCAR Cup Series race weekend. On December 1, the Kansas Lottery approved the proposal without the hotel at a budget of $386 million, with a planned opening date in early 2012. The project was given the final go-ahead in February 2010, when the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission signed off licensing background checks.

==== Construction of Hollywood Casino, schedule changes ====

Boreger stepped down from track leadership to run Kansas Entertainment and the casino, promoting the track&#x27;s vice president of marketing and sales, Patrick Warren, to run the track in March 2010. Warren announced a desire to rebound from effects from the Great Recession. On April 28, the final casino plan was announced, calling for around 2,300 slot machines, around 1,050 employees, and a 300-room hotel expansion on a 268,000 square foot plot of land. Groundbreaking on the Hollywood Casino commenced on April 30, 2010. As a result of France Kennedy&#x27;s promise of a second Cup Series race weekend if the casino was built, the future of the IndyCar Series at the track was left uncertain due to scheduling conflicts. In July, ISC petitioned for the track to get a second Cup Series race weekend, and by August 7, the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; reported that the track would get a second race weekend. On August 10, NASCAR officially confirmed the second NASCAR race weekend, along with the track announcing the addition of lights for night racing. The next month, IndyCar announced their departure from the track. The casino&#x27;s topping out ceremony was performed on March 23, 2011, with the casino opening to the public on February 3, 2012.

=== Renovations, capacity decline ===
On July 8, 2011, the track announced renovations to the track, including a repaving and reconfiguration of the oval track, and the addition of a new infield road course. Among said changes to the track were an increase of variable banking from 15 degrees to 20 degrees. The track has seen a capacity decline in recent years; according to ISC archive records, the track decreased from a capacity of 64,000 seats to 48,000 in 2019.

== Events ==

=== Racing events ===

==== NASCAR ====
As of 2024, the track holds two annual NASCAR weekends: the fall Hollywood Casino 400 and the spring AdventHealth 400. The former was first run in the track&#x27;s inaugural season in 2001. The latter race weekend was added to the NASCAR Cup Series schedule starting in 2011, taking a race weekend from the Auto Club Speedway. Along with its Cup Series races, the track also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series support events for Cup Series races, including the Kansas Lottery 300 and the Heart of America 200.

==== Open-wheel racing ====
On May 28, 1999, the Indy Racing League announced races for the 2001 IRL season, with the race being held in July. In 2007, the race was moved to late April from its usual American Independence Day weekend. The track&#x27;s annual IndyCar race ran annually until 2010, with IndyCar deciding not to renew in 2011 due to schedule conflicts with NASCAR and a second NASCAR race weekend date at the track.

==== Sports car racing ====
In 2012, the Rolex Sports Car Series announced that they would run a Grand Prix event at the newly-constructed road course at the track. The race was first run on August 17, 2013, and was run for a second time in June 2014.

=== Other events ===
The track is one of the Richard Petty Driving Experience&#x27;s tracks that the general public can drive racecars on; an official announcement was made in 2000. Since 2016, the track has been the host of the American Royal World Series of BBQ competition.

In 2011, the track held the Kanrocksas Music Festival, a rock music festival. The event was first announced on April 26, 2011, and was held in August; the inaugural festival featured acts such as Eminem, The Flaming Lips, Kid Cudi, Primus, and others. In 2013, the event was scheduled to be held in June; however, the event was cancelled in May after a lack of tickets were sold.

<text>The Ayr Mountains (; ) are a mountain range in Karkaraly District, Karaganda Region, Kazakhstan.

The Pavlodar Region border stretches at the feet of the northern slopes of the range. The Zhosaly Sanatorium is located on the northwestern side of the highest mountain of the Ayr chain. 

==Geography== 
The Ayr Mountains are part of the Kazakh Upland system (Saryarka). It is a range of moderate altitude located to the north of lakes Saumalkol and Karasor. The mountains mark the northern limit of the wide plain where Karasor and its neighboring lakes lie, stretching alongside the southern slopes of the range. The Zheltau range lies off the northeastern end of the range and the Kyzyltau further east. The Semizbughy rises to the north of the northwestern slopes.

The highest point of the Ayr chain is high Zhosaly (Жосалы), located at the southwestern end. The soil of the mountains is dark brown. River Ashchysu has its sources in the range and flows below its northern slopes and river Ashchysu of the Nura basin, flows westwards to the north of the range.

==Flora==
Steppe vegetation grows on the slopes, including wormwood, sedges, fescue and alpine oatgrass. In protected valleys there are clumps of birch, wild rose and hawthorn.

<text>Waiting for the Weekend is a book published in 1991 by Canadian architect, professor and writer Witold Rybczynski.

In &quot;Waiting for the Weekend&quot;, Rybczynski recounts the evolution of the seven-day week, which came into being with the Babylonian calendar, and the later, more modern, development of the two-day weekend. In so doing, he tells the history of leisure and time off; starting first with &quot;taboo&quot; days, market days, public festivals and holy days and how, with the coming of the Industrial Revolution the practice of &quot;keeping Saint Monday&quot;, that is, staying home from work, evolved into the modern weekend.

<text>The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations is a British research and consulting organisation, specialising in how people behave in groups and organisations. Staff use social science methods to address research questions and creative, psychoanalytic and systems approaches to work with organisations and individuals. The Institute is a non-profit (UK charity No.209706) that aims to enable learning and change that will benefit people and the planet. There are sister organisations in China and Germany.

It was formally established in September 1947. It publishes a peer-reviewed journal &quot;Human Relations&quot; with Sage Publications and it hosts the journal &quot;Evaluation&quot;. The Institute is located in Gee Street in Clerkenwell, London.

==Activities==
The Tavistock Institute offers research, consultancy, project evaluation work and professional development programmes, based on unique methodologies drawn from social sciences and applied psychology. Methods include systems psychodynamics, complexity theory, Theory of Change and Social Dreaming. The main method is experiential learning - learning through experience. 

The Institute&#x27;s website describes its work as having a focus on how humans relate to each other and non-human systems, how people grow and learn and effect creativity and change, in groups. 

=== Research, evaluation and consultancy ===
Recent project work includes leadership development programmes in the NHS, work with female innovators in European sustainable fashion via the &quot;shemakes&quot; collaboration, a 5 year programme of work with women and girls’ projects in England, an evaluation of Barnardo&#x27;s work with care-experienced young people, including a focus on the voices of the young people, and a study of continuing vocational education for the European Union. 

The Institute&#x27;s clients are individuals, teams, organisations and partnerships of organisations – undertaking work and projects in government, business / industry and the 3rd &amp; 4th sectors at local, national and international level. The list includes organisations and sectors of all shapes and sizes, from grassroots community-based organisations to government agencies. Examples include the European Union, many British government departments, Third Sector and private clients. 

In 2023, the Institute&#x27;s organisation in Europe, Tavistock Institut gGmbH, based in Germany, moved its office to Berlin. The Institute has an arm in China - Tavistock Institute China.

=== Professional development ===
The professional development and training work that the Institute offers is based on 75+ years of research and practice. Programmes are led by expert practitioners in the fields of organisation development and group relations.

The Institute is developing online training with the global education platform FutureLearn.

Learning programmes are tailored and delivered in-house or online for organisations, including the NHS.

=== Sharing knowledge ===
The academic journal &quot;Human Relations&quot; is owned by the Tavistock Institute and published by Sage.

Recent books and reports published by authors linked to the Institute include a Systems Psychodynamics trilogy, a book on the Theory of Change and how it can be used to support organisational development and a report on labour shortages in the European Union published by Eurofound.

==History ==
The early history of the Tavistock Institute overlaps with that of the Tavistock Clinic because many of the staff from the Clinic worked on new, large-scale projects during World War II, and it was as a result of this work that the institute was established. 

During the war, staff from the Tavistock Clinic played key roles in British Army psychiatry. Working with colleagues in the Royal Army Medical Corps and the British Army, they were responsible for innovations such as the War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs) and Civil Resettlement Units (CRUs). The group that formed around the WOSBs and CRUs were fascinated by this work with groups and organisations, and sought to continue research in this field after the war. Various influential figures had visited the WOSBs during the war, so there was scope for consultancy work, but the Clinic staff also planned to become a part of the National Health Service when it was established, and they had been warned that such consultancy and research would not be possible under the auspices of the NHS. Because of this, the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was created in 1947 to carry out work specifically with organisations once the Clinic was incorporated into the NHS. The Rockefeller Foundation awarded a significant grant that facilitated the creation of the institute.

In the early years, income was derived from research grants, contract work, and fees for professional development courses. During the 1950s and 1960s, the institute carried out a number of signature projects in collaboration with major manufacturing companies including Unilever, the Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Co., Shell, Bayer, and Glacier Metals. They also conducted work for the National Coal Board. Particular focuses included management, women in the workplace, and the adoption (or rejection) of new technologies. Projects on the interaction between people and technology later became known as the sociotechnical approach.

The 1950s also saw the institute conducting consumer research and exploring attitudes to things as varied as Bovril, fish fingers, coffee and hair.

In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a notable focus on public health organisations such as hospitals. Studies examined a range of aspects of healthcare, from ward management and operating theatres to the organisation of cleaning staff.

More recently, the institute has conducted work for the European Commission and British government bodies.

=== Research units ===
In the institute&#x27;s early years, there were four main units: Programme Groups A and B within a Committee on Human Resources; Organisation and Social Change and Operations Research Unit; and a Committee on Family and Community Psychiatry.

The Human Resources Centre (HRC) and the Centre for Applied Social Research (CASR) were established in the 1950s, and in 1963 the Institute of Operational Research (IOR) was established in conjunction with the British Operational Research Society. The Centre for Organisational and Operational Research (COOR) was created from a merger of the HRC and the IOR in 1979.

The Self Help Alliance project begun in the 1980s led to further work in evaluation and the creation of a dedicated unit, the Evaluation Development Review Unit (EDRU) in 1990.

=== Key figures ===
The institute was founded by a group of key figures from the Tavistock Clinic and British Army psychiatry including Elliott Jaques, Henry Dicks, Leonard Browne, Ronald Hargreaves, John Rawlings Rees, Mary Luff and Wilfred Bion, with Tommy Wilson as chairman. Other well-known people that joined the group shortly after were Isabel Menzies Lyth, J. D. Sutherland, John Bowlby, Eric Trist, Michael Balint and Fred Emery. Although he died before the TIHR was formally established, Kurt Lewin was an important influence on the work of the Tavistock: he was a notable influence on Trist, and contributed an article to the first issue of &quot;Human Relations&quot;.

Many of the members of the Tavistock Institute went on to play major roles in psychology. John Rawlings Rees became first president of the World Federation for Mental Health. Jock Sutherland became director of the new post-war Tavistock Clinic, when it was incorporated into the newly established British National Health Service in 1946. Ronald Hargreaves became deputy director of the World Health Organization. Tommy Wilson became chairman of the Tavistock Institute. One of the most influential figures to emerge from the institute was the psychoanalyst Isabel Menzies Lyth. Her seminal paper &#x27;A case study in the functioning of social systems as a defence against anxiety&#x27; (1959) inspired a whole branch of organisational theory emphasising unconscious forces that shape organizational life. A.K. Rice did considerable work on problems of management, increasing productivity at one factory by 300%. Eric Miller became director of the &quot;Group Relation Program&quot; in 1969, and in this function he later developed the design of the Nazareth-Conferences.

The Tavistock Institute became known as a major proponent in Britain for psychoanalysis and the psychodynamic theories of Sigmund Freud and his followers. Other names associated with the Tavistock include Melanie Klein, Carl Gustav Jung, J. A. Hadfield, Charles Rycroft, Enid Mumford and R. D. Laing.

==Tavistock for the workplace==
The techniques used to rehabilitate soldiers were believed by some researchers to be applicable to a more human-centered organisation of work in industry by empowering lower ranking employees. This agenda helped showcase the two sociotechnical scholarship attributes: the close association of technological and social systems and also, the importance of worker involvement.

==Focus of conspiracy theorists==
The Tavistock Institute has sometimes been associated with conspiracy theories, the most common of which associate it with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Two books focusing on this are &quot;The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations: Shaping the Moral, Spiritual, Cultural and Political&quot; (2006) by John Coleman and &quot;Tavistock Institute: Social Engineering the Masses&quot; (2015) by Daniel Estulin.

The &quot;Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories&quot; notes that the Tavistock Institute has been named by some conspiracy theorists as having a part in &quot;The most extravagant anti-Illuminati conspiracy theory&quot; of John Coleman &quot;known as [the] &#x27;Aquarian Conspiracy&#x27;. This totalitarian agenda culminates in the Illuminati &#x27;taking control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.&#x27;&quot; By &quot;&#x27;means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit&#x27;.&quot; Todd Van Luling, writing in &quot;HuffPost&quot; also mentioned this idea &quot;from popular conspiracy theorist Dr John Coleman&quot;, saying that &quot;The Tavistock Institute is a publicly known British charity founded in 1947, but conspiracy theorists believe the Institute&#x27;s real purpose is to similarly engineer the world&#x27;s culture.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; looks at Coleman&#x27;s claim that the popularity of the Beatles was an Illuminati plot to advance the &quot;Aquarian Conspiracy&quot;.

<text>First Love (, &quot;Pervaya lyubov&quot;) is a novella by Ivan Turgenev, first published in 1860. It is one of his most popular pieces of short fiction. It tells the love story between a 21-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy.

==Background==
&quot;First Love&quot; was published in March 1860 in the &quot;Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya&quot; magazine. The author claimed it was the most autobiographical of all his works. Here Turgenev is retelling an incident from his own life, his infatuation with a young neighbor in the country, Princess Catherine Shakhovskoy (the Zinaida of the novella), an infatuation that lasted until his discovery that Catherine was in fact his own father&#x27;s mistress.

Critics were divided. Some criticized its light subject matter that did not touch upon any of the pressing social and political issues of the day. Others condemned the impropriety of that subject matter, namely a father and son in love with the same woman and a young woman who was the mistress of a married man. But it had its many admirers, including the French novelist Gustave Flaubert, who gushed in a letter to Turgenev, &quot;What an exciting girl that Zinochka [Zinaida] is!&quot; The Countess Lambert, a close acquaintance of Turgenev, told the author that the Russian emperor himself had read the novella to the empress and been delighted by it.

==Central characters==

Vladimir Petrovich – The storyteller, at the time of narration a 16-year-old boy; the protagonist of the story.

Zinaida Alexandrovna Zasyekina – The object of Vladimir&#x27;s affections. Capricious, mocking and difficult, she is inconsistent in her affections towards her suitors, of which Vladimir is the one to whom she shows (outwardly) the most affection. However, it is the affection of sister to brother rather than between lovers.

Pyotr Vasilyevich – Vladimir&#x27;s father, a stoic symbol of 19th century masculinity; very &#x27;British&#x27; in outlook and apparently unreceptive to emotion but the object of quiet admiration by the son

<text>The Commonwealth of Nations Anzio War Cemetery is to be found about a kilometer from Anzio town in the Lazio region of Italy. It is located south of Rome. It should not be confused with the Commonwealth Beach Head War Cemetery some 3,5 kilometers to the north or the American Sicily–Rome American Cemetery and Memorial, which is located in the nearby town of Nettuno.

==Description and history==
Anzio War Cemetery is a special and communal cemetery for the local and surrounding peoples. It contains 1,056 graves resulting from Operation Shingle in 1944 as part of World War II. Having seen the make up of the 1st Canadian Division which was sent there in 1944 it is clear from the graves that those who rest there were from the units of the 1st Division. There were 1,037 identified casualties.

;Poem
There is a poem about the Anzio War Cemetery written by Michael Elliott-Binns. It is written from the perspective of a man that had experienced a loss in the battle and that was writing for his own personal reasons. The author later commented that &quot;They [the fallen soldiers] seem to be buried on the doorstep of their home.&quot;

;Song
There is a line in a 2014 song &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; by Sabaton which was reportedly taken from a poem by Audie Murphy:
&quot;Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
And where hell is six feet deep&quot;

<doc id="1184904" wikidata="Q4707884" url="?curid=1184904" title="Southwest Corridor (Massachusetts)">
<text>The Southwest Corridor or Southwest Expressway was a project designed to bring an eight-lane highway into the City of Boston from a direction southwesterly of downtown. It was supposed to connect with Interstate 95 (I-95) at Route 128. As originally designed, it would have followed the right of way of the former Penn Central/New Haven Railroad mainline (current Amtrak Northeast Corridor) running from Readville, north through Roslindale, Forest Hills and Jamaica Plain, where it would have met the also-cancelled I-695 (Inner Belt Expressway). The 50-foot-wide (15 m) median for the uncompleted &quot;Southwest Expressway&quot; would have carried the southwest stretch of the MBTA Orange Line within it, replacing the Washington Street Elevated railway&#x27;s 1901/1909-built elevated railbed. Another highway, the four-lane South End Bypass, was proposed to run along the railroad corridor between I-695 in Roxbury and I-90 near Back Bay.

==History==

===Early railroad history===
The Boston and Providence Railroad (B&amp;P) was chartered on June 22, 1831 to build a rail line between its two namesake cities. Construction began in late 1832, and the B&amp;P opened from Park Square, Boston to Canton in 1834. Through Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, the railroad largely followed the valley of Stony Brook. The remaining section of the B&amp;P main line from Canton to Providence opened the following year with the completion of the Canton Viaduct. The B&amp;P, like many early railroads, was primarily intended for intercity travel; the only intermediate stations north of Canton were at Dedham Plain (later called Readville) and Pierpont Village (later called Roxbury).

Two additional stations in Jamaica Plain were added in 1842: Jamaica Plain at Green Street, and Tollgate (later Forest Hills) where the line crossed the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike. Additional stations on the inner part of the line were soon added, including stops at Boylston Street in Jamaica Plain and Heath Street in Roxbury. The B&amp;P began regularly running Dedham Specials (which used the main line to Readville and the Dedham Branch to Dedham station) in June 1842, which made commuting from these intermediate stations possible. A second track from Boston to Roxbury was added in 1839 and extended to Readville in 1845.

Commuter traffic on the B&amp;P – which had numbered just 320 daily passengers from the eight stations north of Readville in 1849 – rapidly expanded thereafter. The railroad cut sharply into the profits of the private turnpike; it became a free public road (Washington Street) south of Dedham in 1843, and north of Dedham in 1857. A third track from Boston to Readville was added in 1873-74. Around 1885, Forest Hills became the outer terminus for some short-turn commuter service. In 1888, the Old Colony Railroad bought the B&amp;P.

===Raising the railroad===
Between the Boston terminal in Park Square and Forest Hills, the B&amp;P mainline was at grade except for Hogg&#x27;s Bridge, which carried Centre Street over the railroad. As traffic increased both on local streets (including horsecars and streetcars) and on the railroad, the numerous grade crossings became increasingly dangerous. (The danger was present even in the earliest years of the railroad; in 1846, a man was killed by a train at the crossing at Tollgate station.)

On June 21, 1890, the Massachusetts General Court passed &quot;An Act to Promote the Abolition of Grade Crossings&quot;, which allowed town officials or a railroad company to petition the state superior court to create an independent commission to determine whether a grade crossing could and should be eliminated. The costs of such eliminations were to be paid 65% by the railroad, not more than 10% by the town, and the remainder by the state. The small local cost provided towns incentive to petition for crossing eliminations to prevent public thoroughfares from being blocked by trains and to avoid deadly collisions. In July 1890, local politicians began planning for a grade crossing elimination project on the busy B&amp;P mainline through Roxbury and Jamaica Plain. The B&amp;P began property acquisition for the project in 1891. The General Court legislated the grade crossing elimination from Massachusetts Avenue to Blakemore Street on June 16, 1892. The cost allocation was changed from the 1890 bill: 55% by the railroad, 31.5% by the state, and 13.5% by the city.

===Highway proposal===

The project started in 1948 with Massachusetts Public Works director William F. Callahan&#x27;s Master Highway Plan for Metropolitan Boston, went through several adjustments and then was terminated in 1972 by Governor Francis Sargent, following popular pressure. Governor Sargent declared a moratorium on all expressway construction within Route 128 in 1970 following the recommendation of the Boston Transportation Planning Review - a task force of private experts, headed by Alan Altshuler, that he appointed to study controversial highway plans. Having been witness to recent housing clearances for the Interstate 93 expressway and Massachusetts Turnpike, as well as similar projects in New York City and other cities, the population of the affected area was largely unwilling to repeat similar costs for another expressway. The Interstate Highway Option, which allowed the state to transfer the $600 million earmarked for highway construction to fund the mass transit project, was not approved by Congress until 1973. Fred Salvucci described Sargent&#x27;s decision to cancel the expressway before the Interstate Highway Option transfer as &quot;It was like he jumped off the top of the Prudential Center and hoped that Alan Altshuler would have a net woven to catch him by the time he got to the bottom.&quot;

The Route 128/I-93/I-95 interchange was nearly completed, leaving unused ramps north of the interchange and two unused bridges which were later removed. In 1973, the state planned to build a 300-space parking garage – to be served by express buses to Boston, Providence, and Logan Airport – on the stub end of I-95 just inside Route 128. However, the project was unpopular with residents in Milton.

Two sections of the railroad embankment remain – one along Mindoro Street just north of Roxbury Crossing, and the other behind the former Highland Brewery at New Heath Street. Numerous granite blocks were recycled in the Southwest Corridor Park and as walls in the Emerald Necklace park system.

In 1989, the Southwest Corridor project was awarded a Federal Design Achievement Award by the National Endowment for the Arts, which stated that &quot;in its social vision, as well as its design and engineering requirements, the Southwest Corridor Project is a model for contemporary urban design.

==Current status==

Much like what had been planned for the median of the unbuilt Southwest Expressway/I-95 right-of-way, part of the corridor was later recycled into the new route for two tracks for the MBTA&#x27;s Orange Line and three tracks for Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and the MBTA&#x27;s Needham and Readville commuter lines with much of the surface area being developed as a linear park. The Amtrak trains used diesel until 1999 when Amtrak completed overhead catenary electrification of the line between New Haven and Boston.

Several houses were torn down on the corner of Cummins Highway and Rowe Street in Roslindale to make room for an interchange. That land is now used as the Southwest Boston Community Gardens.
===Southwest Corridor Park===

The Southwest Corridor Park, maintained by the state DCR, has become a vibrant space for pedestrians, bicyclists, dog-walkers, amateur sports leagues, and community gardeners. The Southwest Corridor Park Conservancy helps maintain gardens, runs summer youth projects in the park, and keeps a website with maps and photos.

<text>Andy Kane (born 25 October 1965 in South London), nicknamed &quot;Handy Andy&quot;, is an English television personality best known for his work on the BBC&#x27;s DIY programme &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;.

==Background==
Kane found fame on &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;, which ran on BBC Television from 1996–2004 and was hosted by Carol Smillie and later Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen, in which he appears as a talkative cockney builder who helps out with home improvement jobs the contestants could not handle. He later made three appearances on the U.S. version of the programme, &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;.

<text>The swimming competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics was held at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center in Atlanta, United States. There were 762 competitors from 117 countries. This was the last Olympics where swimming B-finals were held.

At the time of the games, the facility had a temporary 50m warm-up pool located behind the locker rooms and entry concourse (on the ground); as well as a temporary roof, and open walls (there were wall-like structures/curtains at the diving well and turning end of the pool). The open walls allowed for temporary seating to be in place during the games. A wall and new roof have since been placed on the facility.

A total of 4 world records and 13 Olympic records were set during the competition

The women&#x27;s 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay made its debut at these Games.

<text>Orlando Perez (born July 12, 1977 in Pomona, California) is an American soccer defender, who played eight seasons in Major League Soccer.

Perez never played college soccer, but he was drafted twice in MLS, both times by coach Octavio Zambrano. The first came in the first round of the 1999 MLS Supplemental Draft, when Zambrano was with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Perez failed to make the team and played with A-League&#x27;s Orange County Zodiac. With Zambrano moving to the MetroStars in 2000, he plucked Perez again, this time in the fourth round of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft.

Perez would spend the next two and a half seasons with the Metros, a part-time player his first, a starter at left back his second. Zambrano dealt him midway through the third, to D.C. United with Petter Villegas for Mark Lisi and Craig Ziadie. Perez then became only one of two players in MLS history (Winston Griffiths is the other) to play for three teams in one season as DC traded him the Chicago Fire for a draft pick after only eight games. Perez was in-and-out of the Fire lineup since. He scored two goals in six years in MLS. Perez was taken by Chivas in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft. He was waived at the end of the 2007 season.

<doc id="1184948" wikidata="Q952802" url="?curid=1184948" title="Illinois Route 21">
<text>Illinois Route 21 (IL 21) is an arterial north–south state highway in northeastern Illinois. It runs from Illinois Route 43 (Harlem Avenue) in Niles to U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway) north of Gurnee. Illinois 21 is 28.13 miles (45.27 km) long.

Along most of its length, Illinois 21 is called Milwaukee Avenue. North of Gurnee, it is called Riverside Drive.

==Route description==

Illinois 21 was the principal route to Milwaukee, Wisconsin before the construction of both the Skokie Highway and the Tri-State Tollway (Interstate 94 and Interstate 294). The towns of Glenview, Libertyville, and Gurnee are principally located along this road. It follows the Des Plaines River for its entire length, and overlaps U.S. Route 45 between Lincolnshire and Prospect Heights.

South of Illinois 43, Milwaukee Avenue remains a major arterial road until it reaches the downtown area of Chicago, where its historical terminus at Lake Street has been moved back to Grand Avenue. It is one of the few diagonal streets in the grid street layout of Chicago.

==History==
SBI Route 21 ran from Chicago to Antioch along Milwaukee Avenue and current Illinois Routes 43, 83 and 137. In Chicago, it also ran along Elston Avenue. In 1940, the route was moved to a new route to Grayslake, and then continued to Antioch. In 1963, Illinois 21 was dropped entirely from Grayslake to Antioch, and in 1972, it was shortened further to its current southern terminus at Illinois 43. The next year, Illinois 21 was rerouted to Gurnee. Illinois 83 and 137 replaced the old Route 21 to (and through) Grayslake.

<text>The Rudolph Wurlitzer Company, usually referred to as simply Wurlitzer, is an American company started in Cincinnati in 1853 by German immigrant (Franz) Rudolph Wurlitzer. The company initially imported stringed, woodwind and brass instruments from Germany for resale in the United States. Wurlitzer enjoyed initial success, largely due to defense contracts to provide musical instruments to the U.S. military. In 1880, the company began manufacturing pianos and eventually relocated to North Tonawanda, New York. It quickly expanded to make band organs, orchestrions, player pianos and pipe or theatre organs popular in theatres during the days of silent movies.

Wurlitzer also operated a chain of retail stores where the company&#x27;s products were sold. As technology evolved, Wurlitzer began producing electric pianos, electronic organs and jukeboxes, and it eventually became known more for jukeboxes and vending machines, which are still made by Wurlitzer, rather than for actual musical instruments.

Wurlitzer&#x27;s jukebox operations were sold and moved to Germany in 1973. The Wurlitzer piano and organ brands and U.S. manufacturing facilities were acquired by the Baldwin Piano Company in 1988, and most piano manufacturing moved overseas. The Baldwin Co., including its Wurlitzer assets, was acquired by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in about 1996. Ten years later, Gibson acquired Deutsche Wurlitzer and the Wurlitzer Jukebox and Vending Electronics trademarks, briefly reuniting Wurlitzer&#x27;s best-known products under a single corporate banner in 2006. Baldwin ceased making Wurlitzer-brand pianos in 2009. Vending machines are still manufactured in Germany using the Wurlitzer name under Gibson ownership. The company ceased manufacturing jukeboxes in 2013, but still sells replacement parts.

==History==
Franz Rudolph Wurlitzer (1831–1914), an immigrant from Schöneck, Saxony, founded the Wurlitzer Company in Cincinnati in 1853. His sons Howard, Rudolph and Farny successively directed the company after his death. The company initially imported musical instruments from the Wurlitzer family in Germany for resale in the United States. Wurlitzer was an early American defense contractor, being a major supplier of musical instruments to the U.S. military during the American Civil War and Spanish–American War. In 1880, Wurlitzer started manufacturing its own pianos, which the company sold through its retail outlets in Chicago. In 1896, Wurlitzer manufactured its first coin-operated pianos.

In the late 1800s, fairs were popular. As crowds grew and mechanical rides began to appear, there was a need for louder music. The fairground organ was developed. Eugene de Kleist of North Tonawanda, New York, was an early builder of such organs (also called &quot;barrel organs&quot;) for use in carousels. Wurlitzer bought an interest in de Kleist&#x27;s North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory in 1897. In 1909, Wurlitzer bought the entire operation, and he moved all Wurlitzer manufacturing from Ohio to New York. In 1909, the company began making innovative automatic harps that were more durable than European prototypes, and from 1924 to the 1930s, eight models were available. The &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot;  theatre organ was introduced in late 1910 and became Wurlitzer&#x27;s most famous product. Wurlitzer theatre organs are installed around the world in theatres, museums, churches and private residences.

With the onset of World War I, imports from Germany became problematic, and Wurlitzer found it necessary to increase manufacturing in the US. In the early 1930s, Wurlitzer built a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing and marketing facility in North Tonawanda, complete with employee recreation areas, showers and a cafeteria. It had two landscaped avenues which fanned out over the area in front of the factory, creating a park and parkway setting off of Niagara Falls Boulevard. Some tree and lamp post installations, laid diagonal, remain to mark these roads. The growing company held its first annual Convention of associated businesses in Buffalo, New York at the Statler Hotel in September of 1937, complete with a three day program of events and a parade. The surviving complex, particularly the central front tower building and main entrance hall, is now a National Historic Landmark. Wurlitzer abandoned production of nickelodeons but continued to manufacture the music rolls for player piano music through a wholly owned subsidiary called the Endless Roll Music Company. Wurlitzer also assumed production of Lyric brand radios from the All American Mohawk Radio Company in Chicago. Lyric radios were a high-end console radio, which retailed for as much as $425 in 1929 (approximately $5,800 in 2014 dollars).

In addition to business acquisitions, Wurlitzer entered into several joint ventures with James Armitage, George Herschell, and other businessmen from the area. He constructed a separate plant at Goundry and Oliver Streets in downtown North Tonawanda specializing in short production runs to manufacture organs and hurdy-gurdies for amusement parks, circuses, roller rinks and carnival midways. Amusement rides, particularly carousels, were assembled at the facility.

Circa 1933, the Wurlitzer name gradually became more associated with jukeboxes than with musical instruments. In 1942, organ production at the North Tonawanda factory ceased and production was shifted to the manufacture of bomb proximity fuses for World War II. After the war, normal production efforts resumed but with more focus on radios, jukeboxes and small electronic organs for private homes. The Rivera Theatre, also in North Tonawanda, possesses one of these historic organs as well as Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center in Buffalo, New York.


Among Wurlitzer&#x27;s electronic instruments, beginning with electrostatic reed organs in 1947, the most important have been the fully electronic organs, especially the two-manual-and-pedals spinet type (from 1971 with synthesizer features) for domestic use. In the mid-1950s, Wurlitzer began manufacturing portable electric pianos.

Rembert Wurlitzer (1904–1963) independently directed the firm&#x27;s violin department from 1949 until his death in 1963, building it into a leading international center for rare string instruments.

In the 1960s, Wurlitzer ventured into new instrument markets. In 1964, Wurlitzer bought the rights, registered trademarks, copyrights, patents, engineering records and factory of the Henry C. Martin Band Instrument Company, which manufactured brass wind instruments in Elkhart, Indiana (not to be confused with the C.F. Martin &amp; Company guitar maker). In 1967, Wurlitzer entered the guitar market as the sole distributor of Holman-Woodell guitars, which were originally sold under the Wurlitzer brand. Wurlitzer then switched to an Italian guitar maker, Welson, before abandoning guitar sales altogether in 1969.

While original Wurlitzer jukeboxes sold well, technology soon outpaced Wurlitzer. By the 1950s, other companies dominated the jukebox market. Wurlitzer sold its Martin rights to LeBlanc in 1971, to focus on its core markets with pianos and jukeboxes. In 1973, Wurlitzer sold its jukebox brand to a German company and closed the North Tonawanda factory. The former Wurlitzer complex today hosts a business park, contractors&#x27; supply store, storage, offices, restaurants and a Platter&#x27;s Chocolate factory. Piano and organ manufacturing continued in Mississippi and Arkansas factories for several years. 

The Baldwin Piano Company purchased Wurlitzer&#x27;s piano-making assets and brand in 1988. Subsequently, the Gibson Guitar Corporation acquired Baldwin and operated it as a wholly owned subsidiary. Meanwhile, Gibson acquired Deutsche Wurlitzer Jukebox and Electronics Vending brand in 2006, briefly bringing the primary Wurlitzer product lines back under one owner. However, Baldwin stopped using the Wurlitzer name on pianos by the end of 2009. Gibson now uses the Wurlitzer brand name exclusively for jukeboxes and vending machines. Wurlitzer continues to manufacture jukeboxes and vending machines at its factory in Hullhorst, Germany. Wurlitzer headquarters are located in Hullhorst, and it has distribution and sales offices in Gurnee, Illinois and Oxfordshire, England.

== Products ==
=== Acoustic pianos ===

Beginning in about 1880, Wurlitzer built a full line of upright and grand pianos. In 1914, Wurlitzer became the sole distributor of Melville Clark Pianos and in 1919 acquired the Melville Clark company. Wurlitzer continued to manufacture pianos at the Clark factory in DeKalb, Illinois under the Melville Clark name. Other brands which have been manufactured by Wurlitzer are Apollo, De Kalb, Julius Bauer, Farney, Kingston, Kurtzman, Merrium, Schaff Bros. and Underwood.

Wurlitzer excelled in piano design. It developed the &quot;Pentagonal Soundboard&quot;, &quot;Tone crafted hammers&quot;, and other unique innovations to help its pianos produce a richer, fuller tone. In 1935, it was one of the first manufacturers to offer the spinet piano to the mass market. This 39-inch high piano was an instant sensation. The spinet came at an opportune time, when many Americans could not afford a full upright or grand.

=== Butterfly grand pianos ===

In the mid 1930s, Wurlitzer unveiled a line of symmetrical grand pianos, or &quot;Butterfly&quot; grands. At this point in Wurlitzer history, all piano manufacturing was exclusively in DeKalb, Illinois. Models ranged from the Student Butterfly having 44 keys, to the 88 key Deluxe Art Deco Streamline Model 1411.

Model 1411 had many innovative patented features. A quartet of raised banding around the body were actually functional sound port slots that radiate all the way around the case, allowing sound to escape the cabinet with the lids closed. The most notable feature was the symmetrical lids that opened like butterfly wings. These lids open to reveal a secondary ported removable inner lid. These lids are decoratively cut out to allow the sound to ring out via a large F hole, similar to a violin, as well as multiple radial slots along the outer edge. Another design innovation was the &quot;Tone Amplifier&quot;. The device consists of a metal flat bar between the piano rim, running under the bass bridge to a fixed point on the soundboard, designed to bring out the tone on a smaller piano. A screw mechanism on top of the bridge allowed adjustment of the tonal output.

Wurlitzer made at least three different versions of the 73 key model butterfly. Each had variations in appointments, such as legs, lyres, and sheet music stands.

=== Band organs ===

After the United States Government imposed high import tariffs on street and fairground organ importation in 1892, Wurlitzer began producing mechanical organs. Most were small barrel organs, playing from a pinned barrel and powered by either steam or cranked by hand. Many of these organs have cases finished in dark (and sometimes black) wood, with gold incised designs, not unlike those of the European manufacturers of barrel organs.

As parts were not subject to import tariffs, almost all Wurlitzer band organs are copied from designs by European manufacturers. For example, the style 104 and style 105 were copied from a Gebrüder Bruder barrel organ. The style 146 was identical copied from Brüder&#x27;s model 79 fairground organ, except that the side wings (portions of the façade concealing the drums) were removed. The style 157 was copied from a Gavioli special style of organ (only 2 or 3 of this style of organ are known to exist; the former organ at Dorney Park &amp; Wildwater Kingdom was one, but it was destroyed in a fire). And, the style 165 is copied from the Gebrüder Bruder &quot;Elite Apollo Orchester.&quot;

As demand for organs grew from the fairground operators, Wurlitzer was approached by Eugene de Kleist, an-ex employee of Limonaire Frères and the founder of the North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory. After de Kleist developed the tonophone for the company, which won a gold medal at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, Wurlitzer invested in his company. Wurlitzer bought de Kleist&#x27;s interest in the business in 1909 and assumed operation of the North Tonawanda factory. The new company invested in new technology, resulting in the adoption of electric motors, and the music source was changed from pinned barrels to perforated paper rolls similar to a player piano roll.
In addition to manufacturing band organs, Wurlitzer also converted band organs made by other companies to their roll scales. This generally resulted in the converted organ having an expanded musical library due to the vast amount of available Wurlitzer music rolls. However, these conversions sometimes required modifications to the organ&#x27;s pipes and could permanently change the sound of the converted organ.

The production of Wurlitzer organs ceased in 1939, the last organ to leave the factory being a style 165 organ in a 157 case (done because Wurlitzer had an extra 157 case remaining in the factory and the owner didn&#x27;t mind the change). During the Great Depression leading up to the end of production, various cost-cutting measures were made, such as the substitution of brass horn and trumpet pipes for ones made of wood (though arguably the change from brass to wood may have been due to the shrill sound produced by the brass pipes which some people may have found unpleasant; wood pipes produced a mellower sound).

Some orchestrions made by the company can be found at Clark&#x27;s Trading Post, Lincoln, New Hampshire, the Music Hall, Nevada City, Montana, and the Jasper Sanfilippo Collection at Victorian Palace, Barrington Hills, Illinois.

===Nickelodeons and player pianos===

Wurlitzer, starting around 1900 until circa 1935 produced nickelodeon pianos, or coin pianos, which are electrically operated player pianos that take coins to operate, like a jukebox.

The company produced various models of nickelodeons, such as the early Wurlitzer Mandolin Quartette – Wurlitzer&#x27;s alternative to the Regina Sublima Piano. This machine has a reiterating piano with mandolin attachment along with an accompanying piano. They later introduced the Wurlitzer A.P.P. roll; a universal roll to be used on all subsequent Wurlitzer nickelodeons. Models such as the B(X), C(X), D(X) and I(X) use this roll.

Wurlitzer also produced an automatic roll changer system so when a roll finished rewinding another was put on in a carousel-like system. An &#x27;X&#x27; at the end of a model number indicates that model was fitted with a roll changer.

Records indicate Wurlitzer sold player piano mechanisms to other manufacturers who installed Wurlitzer components in their own pianos and sold them under other brand names. One example is the Milner player piano company. Milner pianos were built in Cincinnati at a time consistent with Wurlitzer&#x27;s presence there. Company records suggest Wurlitzer acquired the Milner company in addition to the several other companies acquired by Wurlitzer over the years, but it is possible that Milner may have simply used Wurlitzer components in their own product.

=== Theatre organs ===

Perhaps the most famous instruments Wurlitzer built were its pipe organs (from 1914 until 1943), which were installed in theatres, homes, churches, and other venues. These were marketed as &quot;The Mighty Wurlitzers&quot;.

Robert Hope-Jones is considered the inventor of the theatre organ. Between 1887 and 1911 his company employed 112 workers at its peak, producing 246 organs. But shortly after merging his organ business with Wurlitzer, he committed suicide in 1914 in Rochester, New York, frustrated by his new association with the Wurlitzer company, it is said. Moving the business to their North Tonawanda Barrel Organ Factory, from 1914 to 1942, Wurlitzer built over 2,243 pipe organs: 30 times the rate of Hope-Jones company, and more theatre organs than the rest of the theatre organ manufacturers combined.

A number were shipped overseas, with the largest export market being the United Kingdom. The first of these theatre pipe organs to be shipped to the United Kingdom was dispatched from the North Tonawanda factory on 1 December 1924. It opened at its first location – The Picture House in Walsall, at the end of January 1925. This particular instrument (Britain&#x27;s oldest Wurlitzer organ) is now located at the Congregational Church in Beer, Devon. Regular concerts and shows are hosted on the Beer Wurlitzer.

The largest Wurlitzer organ originally built (in terms of pipes), was the four-manual / 58-rank (set of pipes) instrument at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The Music Hall instrument is actually a concert instrument, capable of playing a classical as well as non-classical repertoire. It, along with the organ at the Paramount Theatre in Denver Colorado are the only Wurlitzer installations still in use that have dual consoles. While Denver&#x27;s is the typical &quot;master-slave&quot; system, Radio City is the only surviving original Wurlitzer installation to have two identical and completely independent consoles playing the same organ. Both instruments have been substantially altered in more recent years.

5-Manual theatre organ consoles are extremely rare, and only three were built by Wurlitzer:
* Opus 1351 (28 ranks), originally installed in the Michigan Theatre, in Detroit. The organ was removed in 1956 and is now installed in a private residence in Racine, Wisconsin. Six additional ranks were added, to make it a 34-rank.
* Opus 1587 (21 ranks), originally installed in the Marbro Theatre, in Chicago. It is now installed at the Providence Performing Arts Center in Rhode Island.
* Opus 1942 (21 ranks), originally installed in the Paradise Theatre, in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://barton.theatreorgans.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a group of enthusiasts met in the dining room of Richard Simonton, an early investor of Muzak and formed the &quot;American Theatre Organ Enthusiasts&quot; (ATOE) to preserve remaining theatre organs, including those by other builders, such as Morton, Möller, Kimball, Marr and Colton, Barton, and Kilgen. The ATOE is now known as the American Theatre Organ Society (ATOS). A similar society formed in the UK in 1952 known as the Cinema Organ Society.

=== Jukeboxes ===

The Wurlitzer was the iconic jukebox of the Big Band era, to the extent that Wurlitzer came in some places to be a generic name for any jukebox. (In Hungarian, &quot;wurlitzer&quot; still means &quot;jukebox&quot;, for example – despite Hungarian only using the letter W for words of foreign origin). Wurlitzer&#x27;s success was due to a first rate marketing department (headed by future Indiana Senator Homer Capehart), the reliable Simplex record changer, and the designs of engineer Paul Fuller who created many cabinet styles in the &quot;light-up&quot; design idiom. Another significant factor contributing to Wurlitzer&#x27;s success was the end of Prohibition in 1933 and the resulting increase in the market for coin-operated music machines in bars and dance halls.

Wurlitzer&#x27;s original jukeboxes played only ten 78 rpm records, one side only, later expanded to 24. With the advent of smaller 45 rpm records, Wurlitzer was beat to the punch by Seeburg mechanisms which could play both sides of 50 different records, yielding 100 song choices. Although Wurlitzer ceded the crown of industry leader to rival Seeburg in the 1950s, Fuller&#x27;s designs are so emblematic of jukeboxes in general that 1940s era Wurlitzers are often used to invoke the Rock n&#x27; Roll period in films and television. Wurlitzer struggled on for 20 years or so and made one final effort to keep its jukebox business viable with a nostalgic 1971 model called the &quot;1050&quot;. The model did not sell well and only 1,600 units were produced. The jukebox line was sold to a German company in 1973.

Already in 1960, Wurlitzer founded a wholly owned subsidiary in Hullhorst, Germany, the DEUTSCHE WURLITZER GMBH, which was building electronic organs, vending machines, mostly cigarette vendors, and jukeboxes for the European market. Deutsche Wurlitzer was at that time a major factor in Europe for vending machines and coin-operated phonographs, the internal word for jukeboxes. 
In 1974, when Wurlitzer in the US ceased to build jukeboxes, Deutsche Wurlitzer continued and served the European markets and partly also the USA by own distributors.
Deutsche Wurlitzer GmbH was sold in 1985 to the Australian &quot;Nelson Group of Companies, based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
As it is said below Gibson Guitar Corporation bought Deutsche Wurlitzer by acquiring Baldwin Piano Company, who bought the US Wurlitzer company before. The Australian owned German company continued to manufacture vending machines and jukeboxes and was acquired by Gibson Guitar around 2008. Reason was, that the major shareholder of the Gibson Group would not like the German company to have the right to use the WURLITZER name and logo. in 2013, Deutsche Wurlitzer went out of business and the remaining part was sold to German investors. An attempt to continue with products and a new name was not successful.

Jukeboxes bearing the Wurlitzer name were in production until the company ceased manufacturing in 2013. The Gibson Guitar Corporation acquired the German jukebox and vending machine manufacturer that made them in 2006. The more recent models are able to play CDs.

=== Electric pianos ===
From 1955 to 1982, the company also produced the Wurlitzer electric piano series, an electrically amplified piano variant.

=== Electric guitars ===
In 1966, music store owner Howard Holman used his contacts at the Martin Band Instrument Company, owned by Wurlitzer at that time, to convince Wurlitzer to distribute a line of electric guitars manufactured by Holman&#x27;s start-up company in Kansas. Wurlitzer became the sole distributor of guitars made by the Holman-Woodell Company of Neodesha, Kansas.

The guitar labels reflected Wurlitzer&#x27;s Elkhart, Indiana, location, but with the exception of a handful of prototypes made above Holman&#x27;s music store in Independence, Kansas, the guitars themselves were built in a small two-story building on Main Street in Neodesha. Three models were available: the Cougar, Wildcat and Gemini, all of which were functionally similar but featured different body shapes. The majority of the Kansas-made instruments were six-string guitars, with only a handful of basses being manufactured. Distinguishing features of the first Wurlitzer branded guitars are the W-shaped cut-out in the tremolo mounting plate and the Rock/Jazz selection rocker switch above each pick-up. Another feature of the earliest Wurlitzer electrics was that they were wired for stereo output. In 1967, Wurlitzer ceased its affiliation with the Holman-Woodell Company, possibly due to problems with the finish on Holman-Woodell guitars which resulted in many instruments being returned to the factory.
Beginning in 1967, Wurlitzer-branded guitars were manufactured by Welson in Italy, and the Wurlitzer line expanded to include semi-hollow body electric as well as acoustic guitars. Wurlitzer continued to distribute Welson-made guitars under the Wurlitzer name until 1969 when Wurlitzer stopped selling guitars under its own name.

<doc id="1184951" wikidata="Q1046757" url="?curid=1184951" title="Dolphin-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Dolphin&quot; class () is a diesel-electric submarine developed in Israel and constructed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in Kiel, Germany, for the Israeli Navy&#x27;s Shayetet 7 flotilla. The first boats of the class were based on the export-only German 209-class submarines, but modified and enlarged. The &quot;Dolphin&quot; 1 sub-class is slightly larger than the German Navy Type 212 in length and displacement. The three newer air-independent propulsion (AIP) equipped boats are similar to the Type 212 vessels in underwater endurance, but are longer, nearly 500 tonnes heavier in submerged displacement and have a larger crew than either the Type 212 or the Type 214.

The &quot;Dolphin 2&quot; class submarines are the largest to have been built in Germany since World War II and the most expensive single vehicles in the Israel Defense Forces. The &quot;Dolphin&quot; class replaced the aging , which had served in the Israeli navy since the late 1970s. Each &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarine is capable of carrying a combined total of up to 16 torpedoes and Popeye Turbo submarine-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs). The cruise missiles have a range of at least and are widely believed to be equipped with a 200 kiloton nuclear warhead containing up to of plutonium. The latter, if true, would provide Israel with an offshore nuclear second-strike capability.

The first batch of the class – the three &quot;Dolphin&quot;-I submarines – are set to be replaced by the newer &quot;Dakar&quot;-class submarines from 2031 onwards.

==History==
First budgeted in July 1989 and ordered in January 1990, by November the order for the submarines was cancelled. This was due to budget reallocation aimed at countering Iraqi threats made against Israel following the Iraqi invasion and annexation of neighboring Kuwait during the leadup to the 1991 Gulf War. Funding for the first two boats (&quot;Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot;) was fully subsidized by the German government to restart the construction program and the third (&quot;Tekumah&quot;) received a 50% subsidy. During the First Gulf War, it was revealed that German firms had assisted Iraq with modernizing its ballistic missile and chemical weapon programs, thanks in part to lax enforcement by German customs, in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime protocols which West Germany had acceded to in 1987. These enhanced missiles brought Israeli cities into Iraqi targeting range for the first time, and the Iraqi weapons research program included factories and necessary supplies for the creation of weaponized mustard and nerve gas. Though not a belligerent in the Gulf War, Israeli cities were nevertheless bombarded by these upgraded Iraqi missiles. To compensate Israel for war-related damage and economic losses and keep German shipyards occupied with a high profile project in the post Cold War defense spending downturn, then Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl approved an assistance package to German industry including the construction of two &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarines.

The names &quot;Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot; hail from the retired Israeli WWII-era submarines of the British T class; the third boat &quot;Tekuma&quot; (translation: Revival) commemorates , the third Israeli boat of the T class which was lost in 1968 with all Israeli crew in the Mediterranean Sea during delivery. The names of the newer boats and are taken from retired s, which were themselves named after even older Israeli S-class submarines.

===Additional procurement===

In 2006 Israel signed a contract with ThyssenKrupp to purchase two additional submarines from its HDW subsidiary. The two new boats are an upgraded version displacing 28% heavier than the older &quot;Dolphin&quot;s, featuring an air-independent propulsion system, similar to the one used on German Type 212 submarines. On 6 July 2006, the Government of Germany decided to finance an advance to start the construction, about €170 million, planned for delivery in 2012. The two submarines cost, overall, around €1.3 billion, of up to one-third was subsidized by Germany. In 2010, both Israel and Germany denied having talks regarding the potential purchase of a sixth submarine. Yet in 2011, Israel ordered a sixth &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarine, for which it was reported to pay the unsubsidized cost of US$1 billion. However, in July 2011, during a meeting between German Defense Minister Thomas de Maizière and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense minister Ehud Barak, an agreement was reached to subsidize €135 million of the US$500–700 million cost of the sixth submarine.

In 2016, it was revealed that a new sonar developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems had begun to be fitted on all &quot;Dolphin&quot; submarines in the last two years. The new capabilities provided to the &quot;Dolphin&quot; submarines by the Israeli sonar also include detection of vessels with a low noise signature. The algorithms used in the sonar systems enable it to ignore many of the noises that can disrupt the range of the systems&#x27; activity, while detecting very distant noises.

In late 2016 reports emerged of negotiations for the purchase of three additional ThyssenKrupp built submarines. The former Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who opposed the acquisition during his tenure, called for the Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to investigate the negotiations which included Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s personal attorney David Shimron for work while on retainer to the offices of Miki Ganor which represents ThyssenKrupp in Israel. On 23 November 2016 Mandelblit decided to ask the state prosecutor to move forward with an investigation into the case. In July 2021 with the newly formed government in power and the Netanyahu-led government out of power MK Gantz the new Defense Minister as well as MK Sa&#x27;ar began an official process into initiating a state investigation into the case 3000 submarine procurement case saying &quot;An official inquiry committee that will investigate all aspects of the affair is the need of the hour&quot;. However, the government&#x27;s submarine procurement investigation was delayed as the ThyssenKrupp negotiations for the purchase of new submarines with additional capabilities was ongoing and likely to cost €2.4B.

In October 2017, Israel and Germany confirmed that they finalised a memorandum of understanding covering the Israeli Navy&#x27;s purchase of three more &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarines to be delivered starting in 2027. The deal was formally signed in January 2022 with the then envisaged delivery of the first boat occurring within nine years. These boats would replace the first three of the class which by then would be about 30 years old. Germany would provide industrial subsidies to German companies building and outfitting the submarines covering a third of purchase costs.

==Armament and systems==
Each submarine is fitted with 6 × torpedo tubes, and 4 × torpedo tubes. The very large 650 mm tubes can be used for laying mines, larger submarine-launched cruise missiles, or swimmer delivery vehicles, and with liners the tubes could be used for standard torpedoes and submarine-launched missiles. The boats were first armed with Atlas Elektronik DM2A3 torpedoes using wire-guided active homing to deliver a warhead at a maximum speed of to a target over away, in passive homing mode a speed of and a range up to is possible. Israel has also procured the more advanced DM2A4 torpedo, successor to their DM2A3s, which are electrically propelled, equipped with fiber optic communications and has countermeasure resistant signals processing and mission logic. A wet and dry compartment is installed for deploying underwater special operations teams.

&quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; reported that the &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarines are believed to be nuclear armed, offering Israel a sea-based, second strike capability. In adherence to Missile Technology Control Regime rules the US Clinton administration rejected an Israeli request in 2000 to purchase Tomahawk long range SLCMs. The U.S. Navy has deployed nuclear armed and conventional Tomahawk missiles for its submarine fleet which are launched from standard heavy 533 mm torpedo tubes. The Federation of American Scientists and GlobalSecurity.org reported that the four larger torpedo tubes are capable of launching Israeli built nuclear-armed Popeye Turbo cruise missiles (a variant of the Popeye standoff missile), and the U.S. Navy recorded an Israeli submarine-launched cruise missile test in the Indian Ocean ranging .

The &quot;Dolphin&quot; class uses the ISUS 90-1 TCS weapon control system supplied by STN Atlas Elektronik, for automatic sensor management, fire control, navigation, and operations. The installed radar warning receiver is a 4CH(V)2 Timnex electronic support measures system, scanning from 5GHz to 20GHz frequency bands and able to pinpoint radar sites with accuracy between 5 and 10 degrees of angle (depending on frequency). The surface search radar is an Elta unit operating on I band. The sonar suite includes the advanced Atlas Elektronik CSU 90 hull-mounted passive and active search and attack sonar. The PRS-3 passive ranging sonar is also supplied by Atlas Elektronik, the flank array is a FAS-3 passive search sonar. A notable design feature is the prismatic hull cross-section and smoothly faired transitions from the hull to the sail, improving the boat&#x27;s stealth characteristics. The ship and internal features are constructed of nonmagnetic materials, significantly reducing the chances of it being detected by magnetometers or setting off magnetic naval mines. The submarines have two Kollmorgen periscopes. The &quot;Dolphin&quot;s can mount an external special forces hangar aft of their sail.

The &quot;Dolphin&quot;s are equipped with three V-16 396 SE 84 diesel engines built by MTU Friedrichshafen (now Tognum), developing sustained power. The submarines are equipped with three Siemens 750kW alternators, and a Siemens 2.85MW sustained-power motor driving a single shaft. The propulsion system provides a speed of submerged and a snorkeling speed of . The hull is rated for dives up to . The maximum unrefuelled range is traveling on the surface at and over at submerged; they are designed to remain unsupplied for up to 30 days on station.

==Operational service==
According to news reports the submarines are normally based in the Mediterranean, although one &quot;Dolphin&quot; class was sent to the Red Sea for exercises, briefly docking at the naval base of Eilat in June 2009, which Israeli media interpreted as a warning to Iran. In 2009 the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, quoting an Israeli defence official, reported that the very small Eilat naval station is unsuited strategically to base the &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class boats, specifically noting the tight entrance of the Gulf of Aqaba at the Straits of Tiran as one held by potential adversaries including Saudi Arabia on the east and the demilitarized Egyptian Sinai to the west. Eilat is a strip of coast between Egypt and Jordan. According to The London Sunday Times, the Israeli Navy decided in May 2010 to keep at least one submarine equipped with nuclear-tipped SLCM there permanently as a deterrent in response to rumored ballistic missiles moved from Syria to Lebanon.

If the boats are based at the larger Haifa naval base, access to the Persian Gulf area either requires openly sailing on the surface through the Egyptian controlled Suez Canal as permitted in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty or a long voyage sailing around Africa. According to the Convention of Constantinople signed by the ruling great powers of the time including the UK, France, and the Ottoman Empire on March 2, 1888; &quot;The Suez Maritime Canal shall always be free and open, in time of war as in time of peace, to every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag.&quot; Denied crossing at the Suez Canal and blockade of the Straits of Tiran occurred in both in 1956 and 1967 leading to Israel twice seizing the Sinai to break the blockade. The Egypt–Israel peace treaty allows for the free passage of Israeli vessels through the Suez Canal, and recognizes the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways. Even if a Red Sea or Indian Ocean base is unavailable other nations have used submarine tenders, ships that resupply, rearm, and refuel submarines at sea, when nearby friendly bases are unavailable.

According to two contradictory Sudanese media reports, in November or December 2011 two Israeli air raids against Gaza-bound weapon smugglers in Sudan were accompanied by Israeli submarine activity off the Sudanese coast. The Sudanese government claims no strikes took place.

In February 2012, Ynet, the online version of the Israeli newspaper &quot;Yediot Achronot&quot;, reported that for security reasons applicants for the submarine service with dual citizenship or citizenship in addition to Israeli, which is common in Israel with a relatively high percentage of olim (immigrants), must officially renounce all other citizenships to be accepted into the training program.

Israel National News and The Jerusalem Post both had articles on Sunday, July 14, 2013, which quoted that day&#x27;s London Sunday Times saying that the July 5 Israeli missile strike against the Syrian port of Latakia, previously reported by CNN as an Israel Air Force strike, was made in coordination with the United States, and long range missiles were launched from a &quot;Dolphin&quot;-class submarine. The attack targeted newly unloaded Russian-made Yakhont long range high performance anti-ship missiles and associated radars.

In December, 2020, an IDF submarine transited the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, en route to the Persian Gulf in possible preparation for any Iranian retaliation over the November assassination of a senior Iranian nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.

==Speculation regarding INS Drakon==

Although unconfirmed by either the German or Israeli government, there was speculation that the Drakon would be longer than previous boats of its class and might have new weapon capabilities, including a vertical launch system (VLS). Illustrations released by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), the prime contractor, show it with an enlarged sail and distinctly changed hullform. TKMS went on to describe the Dakar as “a completely new design, which is to be specifically engineered to fulfill the operational requirements of the Israeli Navy.” 

The boat was reported to have been taken out of the water but re-launched again in August 2023. With the re-launch, photographs confirmed a much larger sail which might accommodate its vertical launch missile silos, if these fitted to the vessel. According to analysis conducted by Matus Smutny, the sail &quot;could also contain a special release compartment for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), aerial drones, and/or other special operations and intelligence-gathering equipment. The revised sail could also be related to some kind of proof-of-concept for technology to be used in the upcoming Dakar class&quot;.

<text>John Nichols (November 14, 1834 – September 22, 1917) was a U.S. Congressman from the state of North Carolina between 1887 and 1889.

Nichols was born to Alsey and Charlotte (Broadwell) Nichols near Eagle Rock in Wake County, North Carolina. He attended the common schools and worked for six years in the printing trade. At age twenty-one, he studied at the Lovejoy Academy in Raleigh for a year, then opened a book and job printing business and published a newspaper.

Nichols was a leader in founding the North Carolina Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, and served as its principal from 1873 to 1877. He was a revenue-stamp agent in Durham from 1879 to 1881, Raleigh&#x27;s postmaster from 1881 to 1885, and then secretary and treasurer of the State Fair association.

In 1886, although he had long been a Republican, he was elected as an Independent to the 50th United States Congress, thanks to his support from the Knights of Labor. Nichols served one term of two years (March 4, 1887 – March 3, 1889), being defeated for reelection in 1888. On July 22, 1889, he was appointed chief of the Division of Mail and Files of the U.S. Treasury Department. He became private secretary to the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury on April 1, 1893, resigning just 2 months later on June 30.

Nichols returned to Raleigh, and served briefly in the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue from November. He was appointed United States commissioner for the eastern district of North Carolina on July 1, 1897, serving until his death in Raleigh in 1917. Survived by his wife Virginia and numerous children, he is buried in Raleigh&#x27;s Historic Oakwood Cemetery.

<text>The Central Vermont Railway was a railroad that operated in the U.S. states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont, as well as the Canadian province of Quebec.

It connected Montreal, Quebec, with New London, Connecticut, using a route along the shores of Lake Champlain, through the Green Mountains and along the Connecticut River valley. It also connected Montreal to Boston, in eastern Massachusetts, through a junction with the Boston and Maine Railroad at White River Junction, Vermont.

==History==

The Vermont Central Railroad was chartered October 31, 1843, to build a line across the center of Vermont, running from Burlington on Lake Champlain east to the capital Montpelier, and then southeast and south to Windsor on the Connecticut River. Initial plans had the main line running through Montpelier. However, due to the difficulty of building through the Williamstown Gulf, a narrow valley south of Barre, Vermont, and to land interests of Charles Paine in Northfield, Vermont, a course to the west was selected. The state capital was to be served by a short branch line. 

Construction began on December 15, 1845, and the first section, from White River Junction west to Bethel, opened on June 26, 1848. Subsequent sections opened to Roxbury on September 17, 1848, Northfield on October 10, 1848, Montpelier (including the branch from Montpelier Junction) on June 20, 1849, Middlesex on August 30, 1849, Waterbury on September 29, 1849, and the full distance to Burlington on December 31, 1849. The part along the Connecticut River from Hartford south to Windsor opened on February 13, 1849.

The Vermont and Canada Railroad was chartered October 31, 1845, as a continuation of the Vermont Central north and west to Rouses Point, New York, splitting at Essex Junction, Vermont (east of Burlington) and running north via St. Albans and Swanton. A branch split at Swanton and ran north to the border with Canada. On August 24, 1849, the Vermont Central leased the Vermont and Canada, and it was completed in 1851. However, the Vermont Central defaulted on rental payments, and the Vermont and Canada returned to its original owners on June 28, 1852. The lease was later reinstated.
The Montreal and Vermont Junction Railway was chartered in 1860 and opened in the 1860s, extending the Vermont and Canada&#x27;s branch from the international border north to St. Johns, Quebec, on the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s Montreal and Champlain Railroad. From opening, it was operated as an extension of the Vermont and Canada.

The Sullivan County Railroad continued south from Windsor to Bellows Falls, Vermont, where it met the Cheshire Railroad toward Boston. At first it was operated by the Central Vermont, but later the Boston and Maine Railroad gained control of it, giving trackage rights to the Central Vermont. Similarly, the Vermont Valley Railroad, running south from Bellows Falls to the New London Northern Railroad in Brattleboro, was originally owned by the Rutland Railroad and later by the B&amp;M.

In 1867 the Vermont Central leased the Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly Railroad, running east from St. Johns to Waterloo, Quebec. The Waterloo and Magog Railway was later built as an extension from Waterloo south to Magog.

The Vermont Central leased the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad on March 1, 1870, extending its line from Rouses Point west to Ogdensburg, New York. On January 1, 1871, the Vermont Central leased the Rutland Railroad system, giving it routes from Burlington to Bellows Falls, Vermont, and Chatham, New York. The New London Northern Railroad was leased on December 1, 1871. On November 2, 1872, the name was changed to the Central Vermont Railroad.

Though the Missisquoi Railroad was chartered as an independent entity in 1867, the Central Vermont RR gained control of it shortly thereafter. It was formally leased in July 1873, providing a branch from St. Albans northeast to Richford, Vermont. It was operated until November 15, 1877, when the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad took it over. The company was reorganized in December 1886 as the Missisquoi Valley Railway, and was once again leased to the Central Vermont.

The Montpelier and White River Railroad opened in 1876 and was leased to the Central Vermont, running from the end of the Montpelier Branch south to and beyond Barre.

The Consolidated Railway was formed on June 30, 1884, to consolidate the &#x27;Central Vermont&#x27; and &#x27;Vermont and Canada&#x27;, and to settle litigation between the two companies. A new Central Vermont Railroad was formed on July 1, 1884 to take over from the Consolidated Railway.
In 1889, the Burlington and Lamoille Railroad was reorganized as the Burlington and Lamoille Valley Railroad and leased by the Central Vermont. This provided a branch from Essex Junction to the Lamoille Valley Railroad at Cambridge Junction in Cambridge, Vermont, and a quickly abandoned redundant line from Essex Junction west to Burlington. This second connection crossed the Winooski River near Essex Junction and connected to the Rutland Railroad at the south end of Burlington near the present-day terminus of I-189.

The Montreal and Province Line Railway was formed in 1896 as a reorganization of the Montreal, Portland and Boston Railroad. Originally planned as a branch of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad to Montreal, and operated by the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, it was taken over by the Central Vermont upon reorganization. The main line ran from the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s Montreal and Champlain Railroad at Saint-Lambert, across the St. Lawrence River from Montreal, southeast to Farnham on the Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly Railroad, with an extension continuing southeast to Frelighsburg. A branch went east from Marieville to St. Cesaire.
In 1896, the Central Vermont entered receivership, and the Rutland Railroad was separated. The Grand Trunk Railway bought the bankrupt company on March 20. The Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad lease ended in 1898, and that company was leased by the Rutland in 1901. The Central Vermont Railroad was sold at foreclosure on March 21, 1899, and was reorganized as the Central Vermont Railway on May 1. During this process, on April 15, 1899, it purchased the Missisquoi Valley Railroad outright.

On July 12, 1920, the entire Grand Trunk system was placed under the control of a &quot;Board of Management&quot; by the federal Department of Railways and Canals in Canada after several years of financial difficulties. After several years of legal battles by Grand Trunk shareholders, intent on preventing the federal government from nationalizing the company, the company was nationalized on January 20, 1923, and fully merged into the Crown corporation Canadian National Railway.

===CN and NECR: 1923-present===
On December 12, 1927, in the aftermath of the Great Vermont Flood of 1927, the Central Vermont Railway entered receivership again, and was reorganized January 31, 1930, to form a new company of the same name.

While the Central Vermont was no longer independent, it kept much of its corporate identity and was run as a separate railroad from the rest of the CN system. As the grip of the Great Depression eased, the railroad became a relatively successful arm of the CN network until the postwar period. It moved a wide range of freight from general merchandise and furniture to milk and agricultural products.

During the 1950s, diesels from CN began to appear on the Central Vermont, with the last steam locomotive ending service in 1957. The 1960s were an especially-rough period due to declining traffic, rising costs, and falling revenues.
Under the Grand Trunk and later the Canadian National, the Central Vermont system saw many of its unprofitable branch lines abandoned. The CN continued to operate the CV as a modestly successful system; however, in the process leading up to the privatization of the CN, which took place on November 28, 1995, several non-core routes were identified for sale, one of then being the CV.

On February 3, 1995, the CN sold the CV mainline from New London, Connecticut, to East Alburg, Vermont, to shortline operating company RailTex, which renamed the operation the New England Central Railroad. RailTex was merged into RailAmerica in 2000. Genesee &amp; Wyoming acquired RailAmerica at the end of 2012. Operations have continued as before.

==Divisions and branches==
===Richford Branch===
This line was formed as the Missisquoi Railroad, then became the Missisquoi Valley Railroad, and then the Missisquoi Valley Division, before gaining its final name. Operations continued on the entire length until 1984, when a derailment on the bridge spanning the Missisquoi River near Sheldon, Vermont, forced the dismantlement of one of three spans. Operations continued on the east end, while the Lamoille Valley Railroad operated on the isolated west end of the line to Richford occasionally after 1989. In 1990 the tracks from St. Albans to the bridge were pulled up.

The following stops were made on the branch from west to east:
* Saint Albans, Vermont (interchange with the Central Vermont Railway)
* Green&#x27;s Corners, Vermont
* Sheldon Springs, Vermont
* Sheldon, Vermont (interchange with the Missisquoi Pulp and Paper Company)
* North Sheldon, Vermont
* Sheldon Junction, Vermont (interchange with the Saint Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad)
* East Frankin, Vermont
* Enosburg Falls, Vermont
* North Enosburg, Vermont
* East Berkshire, Vermont

<text>Edward Bell (born 7 September 1987, Windsor, Berkshire, England) is an English singer-songwriter, who has been active since 2003.

==Life and career==
Bell became a probationer at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle in 1995, and was surpliced in 1996. A regular soloist from 1999 onwards, his first solo was &quot;Domine Deus&quot; from Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot;, performed in front of Princess Alexandra for the Rose Trust. Highlights at Windsor included singing with José Carreras, Mark Dobell and Joanne Lunn.

On leaving St George&#x27;s School in 2001, he was offered a Major Music Scholarship to Abingdon School, but decided instead to take up an academic scholarship, and a music scholarship at St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. While in Oxford, he was offered the opportunity to sing with The Sixteen, Henry Herford, and as a part-time tenor for the Keble College Choir, Oxford under Simon Whalley. In 2005, Bell starred opposite the actor, Pippa Bennett-Warner, in a five show production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; as Jean Valjean.

On leaving Oxford in 2006, Bell joined a band, signed to Universal Records. He left the band after a year to pursue a degree in music, resulting in studying in London, taking instruction at Guildhall School of Music and Drama for some of his course.

As a songwriter, Bell has enjoyed success with his music played on BBC Radio Berkshire, Time 106.6, and most recently used his song &quot;Two Continents&quot; in the American-produced independent film, &quot;Descansos&quot;.

On 16 May 2009, he was awarded £15,000 to record his debut album through financing website Slicethepie.com, the youngest person to do so. He followed a group of musicians including; The Alps, Lights Action, and Walk.Dontwalk. He was working on the album with Richard Causon who has worked with the Kings of Leon and Ryan Adams.

The living artists he would most want to duet with are Kate Rusby and Seth Lakeman.

In 2012, he was invited to play keyboards and backing vocals for Mike Marlin on the Stranglers UK and Europe tour. Following this he was asked to play at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London for Emerging Icons, featuring the best of unsigned British talent.

Bell released a video on Vimeo for his song, &quot;Where We&#x27;ve Been&quot;.
