<text>Julien Donkey-Boy is a 1999 American experimental drama film written and directed by Harmony Korine. The story concentrates on Julien, a man with schizophrenia, played by Scottish actor Ewen Bremner, and his dysfunctional family. The film also stars Chloë Sevigny as Julien&#x27;s sister, Pearl, and Werner Herzog as his father. &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; was the sixth film to be made under the self-imposed rules of the Dogme 95 manifesto, and the first non-European film to be made under the Dogme 95 &quot;vow of chastity&quot;.

==Plot==
Julien, a young man with untreated schizophrenia, meets a young boy playing with several turtles in a New York City park. Fascinated by the turtles, Julien asks if he can have one. When he is denied, he strangles the boy, then buries his body in the mud before praying for mercy from God.
At home, Julien resides with his dysfunctional family, consisting of his domineering and emotionless German father; his childlike pregnant sister Pearl; his younger brother, Chris, an aspiring wrestler who spends his days exercising and practicing wrestling moves; and their paternal grandmother, who is largely disconnected from the rest of the family.

The family&#x27;s father spends the majority of his time recounting national historical narratives, drinking, and inflicting psychological and physical abuse on Chris. During one of Chris&#x27;s exercise sessions, his father forces him outside in the cold and hoses him down with water. He also pines for his deceased wife, going so far as begging Chris to wear his mother&#x27;s wedding dress and dance with him. Meanwhile, Julien works as a teacher&#x27;s aide at a school for the blind. Julien spends most of his spare time going to confession, muttering to himself on the streets, and imagining conversations with Adolf Hitler.

Julien is also riddled with grief over his mother&#x27;s death, and Pearl sometimes soothes him by pretending to be their mother on the telephone. Pearl spends most of her days searching for baby clothes for her soon-to-be-born child, and making lists of her favorite baby names. Searching for other hobbies, she decides to take up learning to play the harp. Chris compulsively practices wrestling moves on trash cans, and sometimes incites matches with Julien. Their father recounts historical stories, lambasts Julien and Pearl for &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; poetry and being &quot;a dilettante and a slut&quot; respectively, and pines for his dead wife.

Julien and Pearl accompany their father to a local Baptist church, where the sermon has a profound impact on Julien. Some time later, Pearl and Julien spend a day together going ice skating at an indoor skating rink. Julien tries to sell some homemade skates to a Hasidic boy and Pearl takes to the ice despite being heavily pregnant. She trips, landing on her abdomen and causing a miscarriage. At the hospital, Julien convinces a nurse to let him hold the baby, saying it is his. She allows it, but while alone with the baby, Julien escapes home on a bus. Julien goes to his room, hides under the blankets, cradles the baby and mutters prayers.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; was the first American film made in accordance with the rules of the Danish filmmaking collective Dogme 95. Shot in New York on MiniDV tape, the film was transferred to 16mm film before being blown up to 35mm film for the master print. Korine used this method to give the film a low-definition, grainy aesthetic. Much of the actors&#x27; dialogue was improvised.

The film utilizes several cinematographic styles, including stop-motion photography, parallel cuts, and still photographs in order to tell its story.

The film’s budget of $1.5 million was mostly spent on travel and work visas for Herzog and Bremner, as well as post-production in Denmark.

===Dogme 95===
Korine broke a few of the Dogme 95 rules in making the film. Dogme 95&#x27;s tenets stipulate all the camerawork must be handheld, but this film uses hidden cameras that are technically not handheld. There is also the use of non-diegetic music (Oval&#x27;s &quot;Mediation&quot; from &quot;Systemisch&quot; in the ice-skating scene, same group&#x27;s &quot;Shop In Store&quot; from &quot;94 Diskont&quot;). Finally, the film breaks the rule that the director must not be credited; however, the film only displays Harmony Korine&#x27;s name and not an official director title.

Despite these transgressions, the original Dogme 95 committee endorsed &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot;. In an interview on the &quot;Epidemic&quot; DVD, Lars Von Trier, Dogme 95 co-creator, lauded Korine&#x27;s ability to interpret the rules creatively.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 1999. It received a limited release in Los Angeles at a single cinema on October 15, 1999; the film showed for a month&#x27;s time at the Los Angeles Theatre, and grossed a total of $80.226 by that November. It was given a wide theatrical release in European countries the following year, particularly in France and the Netherlands. The film grossed $85,400 domestically and $7,042 in other countries for a worldwide total of $92,442.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot; currently holds a 29% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Director Harmony Korine takes a big stylistic swing that will miss with most audiences, producing an unfocused and mean-spirited art film with a bitter aftertaste.&quot; The film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 23 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

&quot;Empire&quot; said that &quot;Despite some creditable performances, Korine&#x27;s bizarre, shambling direction renders the result less ground-breakingly experimental than rectum-numbingly dull.&quot; Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film &quot;A self-indulgent mess.&quot;

Despite a sense of negative reaction to &quot;Julien Donkey-Boy&quot;, it was praised by some critics. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying the film attained a &quot;depth of compassion and understanding ... [it] acquires a spiritual dimension that allows it ultimately to become an act of redemption&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; awarded the film a score of B+, describing the film as &quot;an exciting artistic leap&quot;, while writing that &quot;Korine — working with cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who shot the Dogma [sic] breakthrough &quot;The Celebration&quot; — discovers visual ways to convey emotional terrain that will serve him well, I hope, even after he outgrows shock as an artistic goal.&quot;

Additional praise for the film came from &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film 3/4 stars, saying that &quot;[The film] adds up to something, unlike a lot of movies where individual shots are sensational, but they add up to nothing&quot;; Ebert did, however, note that the film had a very limited audience: &quot;The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn. You know who you are&quot;.

The Stoke Gifford area is also home to the main campus of the University of the West of England, and offices of Hewlett-Packard and MOD Abbey Wood, although since 2023 parish boundary changes these are now in the Stoke Park and Cheswick parish.

The parish includes the neighbourhoods of Little Stoke and Harry Stoke. It borders Filton, to the south-west, Patchway to the north west, Bradley Stoke to the north, Winterbourne and Hambrook to the east, and Cheswick to the south.

==History==
===Manor of Giffard===
Following the Norman Invasion of 1066, William the Conqueror gave the manor of Stoke Gifford to Osbern Giffard, one of his knights. Giffard himself was a native of Longueville-le-Giffard, Normandy, now known as Longueville-sur-Scie, from which the &#x27;Gifford&#x27; suffix derives. The &#x27;Stoke&#x27; part of the name may come from the Stoke Brook, or may also be a reference to the Saxon word &#x27;Stoche&#x27; meaning &#x27;property of or dependent farmstead&#x27;. Bradley Stoke and Stoke Lodge, both 20th-century estates, were also given the name.
Extensive histories of Stoke Gifford can be found online.
The manor remained in the Giffard family until 1337, when it was granted to Maurice de Berkeley (died 1347), 2nd son of Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (1271–1326). Thus was founded the long and distinguished cadet branch of &quot;Berkeley of Stoke Gifford&quot;. In 1553 a new late-Tudor manor house was built by Sir Richard Berkeley (died 1604), 7th in descent from Maurice de Berkeley (died 1347). It became known as Stoke Park, and was rebuilt in 1750 by Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt (died 1770), from a neo-classical design by Thomas Wright.

===Urban expansion in the 20th and 21st centuries===
Like much of the nearby area, Stoke Gifford saw rapid population expansion in the late 20th century. Before the 1980s Stoke Gifford was just a small village, straggling along the main street, North Road. In 1987 it was designated for urban expansion, alongside neighbouring Bradley Stoke, as part of the Avon County Council Structural Plan and Northavon Local Plan.

In 2023, following an increase in housing and population in the south of the parish, it was divided into two, with the southern part becoming a new parish of Stoke Park and Cheswick.

==Governance==
The area falls in the Stoke Gifford electoral ward. This ward starts in the east at Winterbourne.

In 1894 Stoke Gifford became part of Barton Regis Rural District, in 1904 it became part of Chipping Sodbury Rural District, in 1935 it became part of Sodbury Rural District, in 1974 it became part of Northavon non-metropolitan district in the non-metropolitan county of Avon, in 1996 it became part of the South Gloucestershire unitary authority area in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire.

==Local amenities==
The Church of England parish church of St Michael&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building.

There is a row of shops on Ratcliffe Drive including a Tesco Express, dentist and medical centre and few more shops on one of the roads off North Road. There is a pub, the Beaufort Arms, and a small coffee shop in the Old School Rooms across The Green from the church. There are several large supermarkets within walking distance.

Local children walk or cycle to nearby St Michael&#x27;s C of E Primary School &amp; Abbeywood Community School, while the church runs a pre-school nursery in the old vicarage. In 2008, a new pre-school and Nursery opened adjacent to Bristol Parkway because of population increases in the surrounding areas. The Old School Rooms hosts the Explorer Scouts, Scouts, Cub Scouts, Beaver Scouts and Brownies.

The area has two parks, each with children&#x27;s play equipment, and a pair of tennis courts. South of Stoke Gifford is Bristol&#x27;s Stoke Park, part of a large green area known as the &#x27;Green Lung&#x27;.

Stoke Gifford Parish Council provoked national interest and condemnation in April 2016 when they resolved to charge parkrun runners a fee to use a park, resulting in the closure of the event in June 2016.

Stoke Gifford Cricket Club has won the Bristol &amp; District 30 over cricket league a record three times in 2018, 2021 and 2022.

<doc id="1166569" wikidata="Q703097" url="?curid=1166569" title="Edict of Restitution">
<text>The Edict of Restitution was proclaimed by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna, on 6 March 1629, eleven years into the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Following Catholic military successes, Ferdinand hoped to restore control of land to that specified in the Peace of Augsburg (1555). That treaty&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical Reservation&quot; had prohibited further secularization of lands held by the Catholic church after 1555, disallowing any transfer of such lands to Protestant control. However, as the Holy Roman Empire descended into the Thirty Years&#x27; War, weak emperors had been unable to enforce this provision against Protestant encroachments.

== Background ==
The Diet of Speyer (1529) introduced the principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;: in essence, agreeing to disagree within the Holy Roman Empire. With that principle confirmed by the Peace of Augsburg, large-scale violence between Lutherans and Catholics in Germany was temporarily avoided.

Some Protestant princes interpreted this principle to mean that the Peace of Augsburg allowed secularization of lands held under Catholic church officials who converted to Protestantism. With the Emperors unable to enforce an interpretation more favorable to them, lands traditionally held by the Catholic church continued to be secularized in this way after the Peace of Augsburg.

In Europe at this time, and in particular the German states within the Holy Roman Empire, control over land and its inheritance was frequently contested, as it was the main source of both power and wealth. Noble families sought to control as much land within the extended family as possible, including by appointing younger sons prince-bishops or prince-abbots. This system created strong incentives to convert to Protestantism and secularize land, thereby seizing control of it from the Catholic Church.

== The Edict ==
The &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; attempted to retroactively enforce Ferdinand&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;Ecclesiastical Reservation&quot; of the Augsburg treaty, effectively undoing changes in control over large areas of land. This had a strong polarizing effect, causing the approximately 1,800 states of the Holy Roman Empire to form disparate, violently opposed blocs.

If fully effected, it would have changed the rulers of the already secularized Archbishopric of Bremen and Archbishopric of Magdeburg, 12 bishoprics, and over 100 religious houses throughout the German states. What was implemented resulted in a great transfer of power and property from the Protestants to the Catholics, compounding a divisive religious struggle with conflict for dynastic power among many smaller German princes, who might otherwise have stayed neutral.

This dramatic expansion in the scope and stakes of the Thirty Years&#x27; War was very destructive to Germany&#x27;s lands and people, as mercenary armies marched through neutral states or ravaged them in the course of their foraging expeditions. Tens of thousands of Protestants fled to Protestant-controlled states, generally broadening the war. Central Germany was ravaged repeatedly, probably losing between 25% and 50% of its pre-war population because the competing armies continually seized food, causing widespread famine and deaths.

In northeastern Germany, where Ferdinand&#x27;s power had been weakest, Ferdinand appointed Imperial administrators to take control of the secularized states and cities, re-establishing Imperial authority in an area that had been highly autonomous for a century. Ferdinand&#x27;s role grew and his kingdom was deemed to be more powerful. Many princes opposed this, but had no immediate means of resisting it, with the Coalition destroyed and Wallenstein keeping an army of 134,000 troops in the field to enforce Imperial authority. French alarm at the threat a united Empire could pose ultimately led to French intervention in the war.

Wallenstein personally disliked the Edict, as it interfered with the region he considered his own, but he did his duty for the emperor to the fullest, stating that &quot;he would teach the Electors manners. They must be dependent on the emperor, not the emperor on them.&quot; The princes responded by joining the effort of Maximilian of Bavaria to compel Ferdinand to dismiss Wallenstein. Their chance came in 1630, when Ferdinand called a meeting of the Electors in Regensburg because he wanted his son Ferdinand elected King of the Romans (future Holy Roman Emperor). Ferdinand needed their cooperation to approve his son as successor. Ferdinand also hoped to persuade the Electors to approve greater direct Imperial involvement in European wars.

John George I of Saxony and George William of Brandenburg (both Protestant) did not attend the meeting, in protest against the Edict. The Electors who were present concluded that they had little to gain from additional involvement in the wars, and Maximilian asked Ferdinand for the dismissal of Wallenstein. To win over the Electors, Ferdinand removed Wallenstein in August 1630, allowing him to resign to save face. The dismissal of the most powerful military figure in Europe was a major victory for the Electors, and the Regensburg conclave is considered a defeat for Ferdinand.

In July 1630, Gustavus Adolphus landed in Pomerania with 4,000 men in response to the persecution of the Protestants. Without Wallenstein, Ferdinand had to turn to Maximillian and Tilly to stop the new threat. This turned the tide of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The Edict of Restitution was effectively revoked by the terms of the Peace of Prague (1635). Led by Cardinal Dietrichstein, 22 theologians, mostly Dominicans and Capuchins led by Don Diego Quiroga, voted in favor of its repeal. A minority of Jesuits led by Lamormaini voted against repeal.

<doc id="1166571" wikidata="Q497705" url="?curid=1166571" title="Jeonji of Baekje">
<text>Jeonji (died 420) (r. 405–420) was the eighteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

As the eldest son, he was confirmed as successor to King Asin, in 394. His queen was Lady Palsu of the Hae clan.

Jeonji spent much of his youth in the Wa kingdom of Yamato Japan as hostage, going there in 397. Upon his father&#x27;s death, he returned home to find that his uncle Seollye had murdered Hunhae, Asin&#x27;s other brother, and usurped the throne. Hae Chung, an inhabitant of Hanseong, warned him not to enter the capital. Shortly thereafter, Seollye was killed and Jeonji made king. Presumably out of gratitude for this, Jeonji made several members of the Hae clan ministers, as well as marrying Lady Palso of the Hae clan. This put an end to the royal family&#x27;s close ties to the Jin clan.

The traditional dates of Jeonji&#x27;s rule are based on the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. On the basis of more contemporaneous Chinese records, Best (1979) has suggested that the years 405–414 are more plausible.

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, in 406 Baekje sent a tribute mission to the Chinese court of Eastern Jin. It is the first mention of such a mission in more than twenty years, and may indicate that the country had become more secure against Goguryeo. It would have been typical to send such an embassy to inform the Chinese court that a new king had taken power. However, this visit is not confirmed by Chinese sources. In 416 Jin sent envoys to grant the title &quot;General Stabilizing the East&quot; to Jeonji(Yeo Yeong).

==Family==
* Father: Asin of Baekje
* Mother: name unknown – from Jin clan.
** Younger sister: Shinjedo (新齊都媛, ?–?), King Jeonji sent his younger sister to Emperor Ojin to wait on him along with 7 maids during the 39th year of Ōjin&#x27;s reign. She was naturalized in Japan where they called her &quot;Shisetsuhime&quot;.
** Half-brother: Buyeo Sin (扶餘信, ?–429) – first appointed in February, 407 as Minister of the Interior (&quot;Naesin-jwa&#x27;pyeong&quot;, 内臣佐平) then elected in 408 as chief minister (&quot;Sang-jwa&#x27;pyeong&quot;, 上佐平) which he held through the reign of three kings.
*Consorts and their respective issue(s):
#Lady Palsu, of the Hae clan ()
## Guisin of Baekje (久爾辛王, ?–427) – 19th King of Baekje.
#Unknown concubine
## Biyu of Baekje – 20th King of Baekje &quot;(according to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Biyu was an illegitimate son of Jeonji, while other sources name Biyu as Guisin&#x27;s son. It is not known which sources are right.)&quot;

<doc id="1166577" wikidata="Q833634" url="?curid=1166577" title="Mount Maunganui">
<text>Mount Maunganui (, ) is a major residential, commercial and industrial suburb of Tauranga located on a peninsula to the north-east of Tauranga&#x27;s city centre. It was an independent town from Tauranga until the completion of the Tauranga Harbour Bridge in 1988, which connects Mount Maunganui to Tauranga&#x27;s central business district.

Mount Maunganui is also the name of the large lava dome which was formed by the upwelling of rhyolite lava about two to three million years ago. It is officially known by its Māori name &quot;Mauao&quot;, but is colloquially known in New Zealand simply as &quot;The Mount&quot;.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;large mountain&quot; for &quot;Maunganui&quot;.

==Geography==
Mount Maunganui is located atop a sand bar that connects Mauao to the mainland, a geographical formation known as a tombolo. Because of this formation, the residents of Mount Maunganui have both a harbour beach (Pilot Bay) and an ocean beach with great surf, within a short distance. At the base of Mauao, the distance between the harbour and ocean side is a couple of blocks.

The ocean beach has Mauao or Mount Maunganui at its western end, and a man made land bridge connecting Moturiki Island at its eastern end.

Adjacent to Mount Maunganui on its south-eastern edge (from Sandhurst Drive onwards) is Papamoa Beach, another very large suburb of Tauranga. Papamoa Beach has a slightly larger population than Mount Maunganui, but doesn&#x27;t have as many businesses as Mount Maunganui. Both suburbs are distinctly geographically separate from the rest of Tauranga by the Tauranga Harbour; two bridges (SH2 and SH29) and the winding Welcome Bay Road are the only connections by land to the central business district.

Mauao (&quot;The Mount&quot;) is a large lava dome which rises above the town. According to Maori legend, this hill was a pononga [slave] to a mountain called Otanewainuku. The conical headland which gives the town its name is in height, and dominates the mostly flat surrounding countryside. It was formerly a Māori pā, and the remains of trenches can be seen in the ridges, as well as ancient shell middens. Today, it is open to the public year-round, and is a popular place to either walk around, or climb up. From the summit, a good stretch of coastline can be seen in either direction, as well as the Kaimai Range to the west.

==Demographics==
Mount Maunganui covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Mount Maunganui had a population of 6,510 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 696 people (12.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,176 people (22.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,724 households, comprising 3,264 males and 3,249 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female, with 918 people (14.1%) aged under 15 years, 1,332 (20.5%) aged 15 to 29, 3,153 (48.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,101 (16.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.2% European/Pākehā, 13.3% Māori, 1.4% Pacific peoples, 3.2% Asian, and 3.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 20.6, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 58.8% had no religion, 32.1% were Christian, 0.7% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.6% were Buddhist and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,584 (28.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 675 (12.1%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,449 people (25.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,090 (55.3%) people were employed full-time, 837 (15.0%) were part-time, and 141 (2.5%) were unemployed.

==Politics==

Mount Maunganui was politically independent of Tauranga until the 1989 local government reforms.

In 1974, Bob Owens was mayor of both Mount Maunganui and Tauranga, a unique situation in local government in New Zealand. Owens favoured joining of the two municipalities. The election of 1974 was fought on this issue and Owens was defeated in the polls in Mount Maunganui with a landslide victory to Louis Kelvin O&#x27;Hara, at that time the youngest person elected mayor in New Zealand, who challenged him with the catch cry &quot;why share a mayor?&quot;

==History==
Mount Maunganui was known colloquially as &quot;Maunganui&quot; until 1907; during the application process to formally name the area when the first subdivision of land was carried out, Maunganui was dismissed as being too similar to several other towns&#x27; names. One of the early settlers, J.C. Adams, then suggested three alternative names, which were Te Maire, Tamure (the Māori name for Snapper), and Rakataura, with the latter name selected by the Survey Department. The official name Rakataura never came into common use, as Maunganui had long been the unofficial name of the area. The name &quot;Mount&quot; Maunganui originated as a rebranding by early developers, who succeeded in changing the official name of the town from Rakataura. The current name is an example of a tautological place name, &quot;maunga&quot; being a Māori term for mountain (&quot;nui&quot; means &quot;big&quot;).

Mount Maunganui fought fiercely and successfully during the 1950s to retain independence from Tauranga, then failed with the completion of the harbour bridge in 1988.

The former Mount Maunganui Borough Council set records in New Zealand as having never had a deficit in its history, something which Tauranga City Council has never achieved. Critics say the town was built by leveraging the commercial and industrial ratepayers, but Mount Maunganui was a forerunner in some areas and applied the user pays philosophy before it was common in New Zealand.

Anne Speir was the first female professional lifeguard at the beach. She later became a television producer.

The original house of early settler J.C. Adams, the first home built at Mount Maunganui, still stands at 4 Adams Avenue. The 1906 house is registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category II historic building.

==Marae==
The local Whareroa Marae and Rauru ki Tahi meeting house is a meeting place for the Ngāi Te Rangi hapū of Ngāti Kuku and Ngāi Tukairangi.

== Character ==


Mount Maunganui is regarded by many to be a coastal resort town, although Port of Tauranga, a major facility, is also partly located on the western (harbour) side. It is also well known for the quality of its surfing conditions, though parts of the beach are notoriously dangerous. The harbour bridge was opened in 1988, linking Mount Maunganui with Tauranga. The construction of a duplication bridge was completed in December 2009, forming a vital link in Tauranga and Mount Maunganui&#x27;s growing motorway system.

A large container terminal and overseas wharf is located at Mount Maunganui. A branch railway from the East Coast Main Trunk railway runs between the Te Maunga and northern parts of the suburb.

Mount Maunganui also features the popular Bayfair Shopping Centre. The centre is one of the largest in the North Island outside Auckland and Wellington.

Mount Maunganui is a popular New Years destination, with over 20,000 people frequenting the suburb over the New Years period. Many festivities take place on and around the main beach in the north of the suburb.

As part of the Port of Tauranga is located in Mount Maunganui, there are many cruise ship visits annually to the suburb.

== Sport ==

The suburb is home to the cricket ground Bay Oval, which held the 2018 ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup final on 3 February 2018 as well as international cricket matches.

Every year Mount Maunganui hosts the Northern Regional Surf Championships (NRC&#x27;s), and other events such as the NZ Under 14 Ocean Athlete Championships, the Pro Volleyball Tour and The Port of Tauranga Half Ironman triathlon.

== Artificial reef ==
New Zealand&#x27;s first artificial reef was installed at the Mount. Construction of the reef was hampered by lack of funds and ironically, too many waves. Initially the public was told the reef would cost about $500k, but costs escalated to $800k. Media reported that local surfers are disappointed with the waves produced by the reef. The reef has also been blamed for creating rips and has now been removed.

<doc id="1166578" wikidata="Q1677165" url="?curid=1166578" title="Jack Purvis (musician)">
<text>John Purvis (December 11, 1906 – March 30, 1962) was an American jazz musician.

Purvis was best known as a trumpet player and the composer of &quot;Dismal Dan&quot; and &quot;Down Georgia Way&quot;. He was one of the earliest trumpeters to incorporate the innovations pioneered by Louis Armstrong in the late 1920s. He also played trombone and on occasion a number of other instruments professionally (including harp).

==Early years==
John &quot;Jack&quot; Purvis was born in Kokomo, Indiana on December 11, 1906 to Sanford B. Purvis, a real estate agent and his wife Nettie (Jackson) Purvis. Jack&#x27;s behavior became uncontrollable after his mother&#x27;s death in 1912, and, as a result of many acts of petty larceny, he was sent to a reform school. While there, he discovered that he had an uncanny musical ability, and soon became proficient enough to play both the trombone and trumpet professionally. This also enabled him to leave the reformatory and continue his high school education, while he was playing paying gigs on the side. One of the earliest jobs he had as a musician was with a band led by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Not long afterward, he worked with the dance band of Hal Denman.

After high school he worked in his home state for a time then went to Lexington, Kentucky where he played with the Original Kentucky Night Hawks. Around this time he learned to fly planes. In 1926 he was with Bud Rice and toured New England. He then worked the remainder of 1926 and the beginning of 1927 with Whitey Kaufman&#x27;s Original Pennsylvanians. Purvis married in Pittsburgh, in 1927, and soon became a father. His daughter, Betty Lou, was, for a time, a disc jockey in Pittsburgh in the late 1940s, and a correspondent for &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine. This was Purvis&#x27; only verified marriage, and rumors persist that he committed bigamy on several occasions. For a short time he played trumpet with Arnold Johnson&#x27;s orchestra, and by July 1928 he traveled to France with George Carhart&#x27;s band. It is reported that he had an early brush with the law when he cheated a tourist out of his travelers checks and was forced to leave the band and flee France. Ship&#x27;s passenger list information reports &quot;Jacques F. Purvis&quot; returning to New York, from Le Havre, France, on November 19. 1928.

In 1929 he joined Hal Kemp&#x27;s band. From 1929 to 1930 Purvis recorded with Kemp, Smith Ballew, Ted Wallace (a pseudonym for agent Ed Kirkeby), Rube Bloom, the California Ramblers, and Roy Wilson&#x27;s Georgia Crackers. On December 17, 1929 Purvis led his own recording groups using Hal Kemp&#x27;s rhythm section to produce &quot;Copyin&#x27; Louis&quot;, and &quot;Mental Strain at Dawn&quot;.

==The 1930s==
In 1930, Purvis led a couple of racially mixed recording sessions including the likes of J.C. Higginbotham, and Adrian Rollini. One of these sessions was organized by Adrian Rollini and OKeh A &amp; R man, Bob Stephens.

After leaving Hal Kemp in 1930, allegedly because legal issues precluded his going with the band to Florida, Purvis found work with the California Ramblers. He also worked with the Dorsey Brothers and played fourth trumpet with Fletcher Henderson, although only in a rehearsal capacity.

Purvis&#x27; mental stability was always in question, and he attempted suicide on several occasions. Although he was a brilliant musician, capable of either a hot jazz solo or a difficult passage through the hardest of arrangements, he could not be counted on to arrive anywhere on time. This lack of accountability plagued him throughout his life, and can be traced to his earliest years. In many instances, once Jack Purvis showed up to play an extended engagement, not so coincidentally, there was a spike in petty thefts and burglaries for the vicinity of that gig.

From 1931 to 1932 he played with a few radio orchestras and worked with Fred Waring. In 1933 he toured the South with Charlie Barnet. He even talked his way into a job with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra playing &quot;The Carnival of Venice&quot;. During this time he also worked in Texas as a pilot perhaps smuggling illegal goods out of Mexico.

He moved to California and was successful with radio broadcasting work. In Los Angeles, Purvis worked for the George Stoll Orchestra as a writer and even worked for Warner Bros. Studios arranging. He composed &quot;Legends of Haiti&quot; for a one hundred and ten piece orchestra. Afterwards he found work in San Francisco as a chef.

At the end of 1935 he joined Frank Froeba&#x27;s Swing Band in New York. These 1935 recordings with Froeba were the end of Purvis&#x27; recording career. He played a couple of weeks with Joe Haymes&#x27; orchestra and then disappeared for a couple of years. There was a confirmed sighting of him working in a diner in the midwest around this time. It is also speculated that he worked as a ship&#x27;s cook on a freighter at the time.

He was arrested in Texas in June 1937, while working as a cook, for his involvement in a robbery in El Paso, Texas. He was tried and convicted and sentenced to jail time in Huntsville Prison. While in prison he directed the Rhythmic Swingsters, the prison band and also played piano with them. The band regularly broadcast on radio station WBAP in 1938.

==Later life==
In August 1940, Purvis was conditionally pardoned from prison, but he quickly broke his parole and was sent back to prison for six more years. Some sources claim he did this deliberately because he missed the prison band.

On September 30, 1946 Purvis was released from prison one last time. He had a wild reputation and is said to have set hotel rooms on fire. He seldom stuck with one band for very long and was known to hit the streets as a busker. From this time onward he worked at non-musical careers which included working as a chef, an aviator in Florida, a carpenter, a radio repairman in San Francisco. At sometime in his checkered life he was also a mercenary in South America.

According to researcher Paul Larsen, Purvis gassed himself to death in San Francisco on March 30, 1962. Yet Purvis&#x27; death certificate indicates the cause of death to be &quot;fatty degeneration of the liver&quot; rather than death by gas poisoning. 
Cornetist Jim Goodwin claimed that a man who looked like (and introduced himself as) Jack Purvis showed up at a band date a couple of times in about 1968 and that they had a long talk about his life.

<doc id="1166579" wikidata="Q5421523" url="?curid=1166579" title="Exponential formula">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the exponential formula (called the polymer expansion in physics) states that the exponential generating function for structures on finite sets is the exponential of the exponential generating function for connected structures.
The exponential formula is a power series version of a special case of Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula.

==Algebraic statement==
Here is a purely algebraic statement, as a first introduction to the combinatorial use of the formula.

For any formal power series of the form
formula_1
we have
formula_2
where
formula_3
and the index formula_4 runs through all partitions formula_5 of the set
formula_6. (When formula_7 the product is empty and by definition equals formula_8.)

===Formula in other expressions===
One can write the formula in the following form:
formula_9
and thus
formula_10
where formula_11 is the formula_12th complete Bell polynomial.

Alternatively, the exponential formula can also be written using the cycle index of the symmetric group, as follows:formula_13where formula_14 stands for the cycle index polynomial for the symmetric group formula_15, defined as:formula_16and formula_17 denotes the number of cycles of formula_18 of size formula_19. This is a consequence of the general relation between formula_14 and Bell polynomials:formula_21

==Combinatorial interpretation==

In combinatorial applications, the numbers formula_22 count the number of some sort of &quot;connected&quot; structure on an formula_12-point set, and the numbers formula_24 count the number of (possibly disconnected) structures. The numbers formula_25 count the number of isomorphism classes of structures on formula_12 points, with each structure being weighted by the reciprocal of its automorphism group, and the numbers formula_27 count isomorphism classes of connected structures in the same way.

==Examples==
* formula_28 because there is one partition of the set formula_29 that has a single block of size formula_30, there are three partitions of formula_29 that split it into a block of size formula_32 and a block of size formula_8, and there is one partition of formula_29 that splits it into three blocks of size formula_8. This also follows from formula_36, since one can write the group formula_37 as formula_38, using cyclic notation for permutations.
* If formula_39 is the number of graphs whose vertices are a given formula_12-point set, then formula_22 is the number of connected graphs whose vertices are a given formula_12-point set.
* There are numerous variations of the previous example where the graph has certain properties: for example, if formula_24 counts graphs without cycles, then formula_22 counts trees (connected graphs without cycles).
* If formula_24 counts directed graphs whose (rather than vertices) are a given formula_12 point set, then formula_22 counts connected directed graphs with this edge set.
*In quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, the partition functions formula_48, or more generally correlation functions, are given by a formal sum over Feynman diagrams. The exponential formula shows that formula_49 can be written as a sum over connected Feynman diagrams, in terms of connected correlation functions.

<text>The University of Calgary Students&#x27; Union is an organization representing students at the University of Calgary. Every Undergraduate registered at the University of Calgary is a member of the Students&#x27; Union. The Students&#x27; Union is a multifaceted organization serving as part student government, part lobby group, and part business. Students are elected to serve on the Students&#x27; Union for one year following elections held each March.

==Students&#x27; Legislative Council==
The Students&#x27; Union&#x27;s highest governing body is the Students&#x27; Legislative Council and it is where all resolutions, major policies, and positions are voted on. It consists of the five executives and 19 faculty representatives.

SLC also delegates authority to different committees to ensure it maintains transparency and efficient functioning.

==Current 2024-2025 Students&#x27; Legislative Council==

 Non-Voting Officials 

==Faculty Representation==
There are currently 21 Faculty Representatives on the Students&#x27; Legislative Council which is based on a representation by population model. Every undergraduate faculty is represented by at least one Faculty Representative with a representative gained for every 2000 students in a given faculty. All faculties with less than 2000 students registered have one Faculty Representative. Once a faculty reaches the 2000 student threshold it will have two representatives and when a faculty reaches the 4000 student threshold it will have three representatives etc.

Faculty representation is as follows:
* 4 Faculty of Arts
* 3 Faculty of Science
* 2 Faculty of Business
* 3 Faculty of Engineering
* 1 Faculty of Education
* 1 Faculty of Kinesiology
* 1 Faculty of Law
* 2 Faculty of Medicine
* 1 Faculty of Nursing
* 1 Faculty of Social Work
* 1 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine
* 1 Faculty of the School of Architecture, Planning, and Landscape

==Provincial and Federal Representation==
The University of Calgary Students&#x27; Union participates in the Canadian Alliance of Students Associations. Previously, they were a member of Council of Alberta University Students on the provincial level.

==Operations==
As a student-led and staff-run organization supported by student volunteers, the Students&#x27; Union has a diverse organizational structure to manage the scope of its businesses, services, programs, and events. Under the direction of elected student leaders, the SU has a team of approximately 50 full-time staff, more than 200 part-time staff, and more than 300 volunteers who deliver a wide range of services to the organization and undergraduate students. The SU operates MacEwan Student Centre and has services including Bound and Copied (the campus copy centre and cheap book store), Stör (a convenience store), the Den and Black Lounge (a full-service restaurant and bar), the Campus Food Bank, “Mac Hall&quot; concert facilities, and MacEwan Conference and Event Centre within the building. The proceeds of these operations are reinvested directly into SU student programs, awards, and events. Additional services include the off-campus housing registry, campus lost and found, travel and conference funding, campus &quot;Safewalk,&quot; and various wellness and awareness weeks.

==Dispute Over MacHall==
The Student Union at the University of Calgary is currently in a dispute with the university itself over the ownership over the MacHall. The Students Union claims that they own 55% of the building, back from an agreement back in 1969, while the university denies this. Though the students union attempted to solve the issue quietly, there had been on-going negotiations around MacHall, on October 21, 2015, the SU sued the University of Calgary over the dispute. In the past, the University wanted to treat the SU as tenants, as opposed to the partial owners of the building, and the University the sole owners but the SU refused because it would lower their revenue and not allow them to decide what the building is used for. In 2018, the dispute was settled, with the SU receiving expanded rights to manage the building perpetually for the life of the building.

<doc id="1166583" wikidata="Q1435478" url="?curid=1166583" title="Surface piercing">
<text>Surface piercings are piercings that are found on flat parts of the body, giving a double-pierced look that sits flat against the skin. A surface bar follows the plane of skin, while a standard piercing is pierced through the plane. Standard piercings have an entrance hole with an exit hole that is usually directly behind the entrance hole, whereas with a surface piercing the entrance and exit holes are next to each other on the skin surface.

==Types==
Some examples of surface piercings:

*Corset piercing: a series of bilaterally symmetrical piercings, normally done on the back, intended to be laced like a corset.
*Christina piercing: located at the mons pubis.
*Madison piercing: a horizontal piercing located just above the collarbone, at the base of the neck.
*Nape piercing: located on the back of the neck.
*Neck piercing: located on the side of the neck. It is also called &quot;Vampire Bites&quot;.
*Hip piercing: located on or beside the hips (on the pelvis near the hips bones).
*Wrist piercing: located on or near the wrist, generally on the upper side.
*Anti-eyebrow: located under or beside the eye.
*Bridge piercing: located horizontally at the bridge of the nose.
*Pubic piercing: located in the area/ pubic bone for both men and women.
*Belly button piercing: located around or through a part of the navel
*Eyebrow piercing: this goes through the eyebrow or through the skin around the eyebrow.

==Rejection and migration==
Surface piercings can be difficult to heal. They are the most likely to be rejected as they only break through small amounts of skin. This leaves less skin to keep the piercing secure. The body will push it to the surface of the skin causing it to &quot;grow out&quot;. Proper placement and jewelry selection by an experienced body piercer can help alleviate this problem. A healed surface piercing can last from a few months to a lifetime.

<doc id="1166588" wikidata="Q5362018" url="?curid=1166588" title="Eliwlod">
<text>In some old Welsh texts, Eliwlod is a nephew of King Arthur. His father is Madoc, son of Uther Pendragon, an obscure brother of Arthur&#x27;s mentioned a very few times in Welsh literature. 

Arthur thought highly of Eliwlod&#x27;s eloquence. Eliwlod appears in the Welsh Triads, where he is called one of the three &quot;Golden-Tongued Knights of Britain&quot;, alongside Gwalchmei ap Gwyar (Gawain) and Drudwas ap Tryffin. He pays a postmortem visit to his uncle in the form of an eagle in the poem &quot;Arthur and the Eagle&quot;. 

Eliwlod figures in the works of Welsh poet Lewys Glyn Cothi. In the Hendregadredd Manuscript, the poet Bleddyn Fardd praises his patron Rhys ap Maredudd by likening him to Arthur&#x27;s &quot;beloved&#x27; nephew Eliwlod.

<text>Mount Ida College was a private college in Newton, Massachusetts. It is currently closed.

In 2018, the University of Massachusetts Amherst acquired the campus and renamed it the Mount Ida Campus of UMass Amherst, a center for learning and professional development that facilitates connections between the UMass Amherst and industries and communities in the Greater Boston area.

==History==
The Mount Ida School for Girls, once a high school, became a finishing school and was founded in 1899 by George Franklin Jewett, and was named after the hill on which it was located in Newton Corner, Massachusetts.

After encountering severe financial difficulties, it was forced to close during the Great Depression, but was purchased by William Fitts Carlson in 1939 and relocated to its present location in the Oak Hill section of Newton.

The first junior college level courses were offered at Mount Ida in the mid-1900s, and the school was officially re-branded as a junior college in 1961. It was subsequently granted the ability to award associate degrees with the first being awarded in 1967.

The school was later renamed as Mount Ida Junior College, and became a co-educational institution in 1972 which was a logical step since many Vietnam veterans were attending college in the 1970s thanks to the G.I. Bill. Several Boston-based institutions also merged with Mount Ida on the Newton campus: Chamberlayne Junior College (1988), New England Institute of Funeral Service Education (1989), and Coyne Electrical and Technical School. 

The Senior College division awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees began In 1982. Massachusetts allowed Mount Ida to grant three bachelor&#x27;s degrees as Mount Ida filed to drop the &quot;Junior&quot; part of the college name. The Senior Degree program was fully accredited in 1984, with an emphasis on career and professional education. In 2012, Barry Brown was appointed president of the college.

UMass Amherst announced plans to acquire the Newton campus in April 2018. Classes ended after the commencement in the spring of 2018 and students of the small school were offered automatic admission to UMass Dartmouth (though that university did not have all of the same academic programs). Newbury College (which itself closed in 2019) announced that it would grant full transfer credit to Mount Ida students and would help them finish their degrees. Keene State College and Worcester State University also invited students to their campuses and committed to review applications for immediate acceptance and full credit transfer.

==Campus==
Located in Newton, Massachusetts, Mount Ida College was located on a 72-acre campus that once belonged to William Sumner Appleton (1840–1903), father of William Sumner Appleton Jr. The estate was transferred to Robert Gould Shaw II after Appleton&#x27;s death. Shaw commissioned Boston architect James Lovell Little Junior to build a carriage house and horse stable in 1910; this building was subsequently refurbished and was known as Holbrook Hall. The building known as Shaw Hall, which became the nucleus for the Mount Ida campus, was also commissioned by Shaw and designed by Little in 1912. The building known as Hallden Academic Support Center was also constructed in 1912, presumably by Little.

The Shaw fortune collapsed during the Great Depression, and Dr. Carlson purchased the vacant and decaying Shaw Estate and reopened Mount Ida Junior College in 1939. In 1956, a two-story dormitory designed by architect Albert C. Rugo was added to Shaw Hall. Rugo designed several other buildings that were added to the complex in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Academics==
Mount Ida College consisted of four schools (which included some prominent stand-alone schools prior to merger)

* The School of Applied Sciences
** The New England Institute of Mortuary Science
* The School of Design
* The School of Business
* The School of Social Sciences and Humanities

The Gallery at Mount Ida College held exhibitions of regional, national, and international fine artists and designers. The Gallery had featured works in photography, painting, sculpture, video, and a variety of other art forms. The Gallery opened in 1999, allowing artists and designers to have a showcase for traditional and alternative media works as an innovative part of the Mount Ida College Learning Community.

==Athletics==
Mount Ida&#x27;s athletes competed as the Mustangs in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference in NCAA Division III varsity sports, as well as IHSA equestrian competition. Three teams captured North Atlantic Conference (NAC) championships: the 1999, 2000 men&#x27;s soccer team, the 2002 women&#x27;s volleyball team, and the 2007 men&#x27;s lacrosse team. The Mount Ida Mustangs football team competed from 1999 to 2017, compiling an all-time record of 76–119 in 19 seasons and sharing the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference (ECFC) championship in 2012.

==Notable alumni==
* Enid A. Haupt, publisher and philanthropist
* Wishnutama Kusubandio, Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of The Republic of Indonesia from 2019 to 2020
* Thomas Menino, Mayor of Boston from 1993 to 2014, earned his associate degree in 1963 from Chamberlayne Junior College, which later became part of Mount Ida College
* Gary Vaynerchuk, serial entrepreneur and author

<text>Bill Uruski (born July 27, 1942) is a retired politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party governments of Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley.

The son of Frank Uruski and Mary Shwaliuk, Uruski was born and educated in Poplarfield. He did not attend a university; however, he was a Royal Canadian Mounted Police constable from 1962 to 1967, and also worked as a farmer before entering public life. In 1964, he married Elaine Stonoga.

Uruski was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating longtime Liberal MLA Elman Guttormson in the rural, mid-northern riding of St. George. The NDP formed government after this election, and Uruski served as a government backbencher for the next four years.

Uruski defeated Guttormson again in the 1973 provincial election, even though the Progressive Conservative Party declined to run a candidate for fear of vote-splitting with the Liberals. On August 29, 1973, he was named a Minister without Portfolio, responsible for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation and the Motor Vehicle Branch. On March 31, 1976, Premier Schreyer also assigned him responsibility for the Civil Service Act. On September 22, 1976, he was promoted to Minister of Municipal Affairs, still retaining responsibility for the CSA.

The NDP were defeated in the general election of 1977, and Uruski was re-elected by a reduced margin. There were some suggestions that he would run to succeed Schreyer as party leader in 1979, although these ultimately came to nothing.

Howard Pawley led the NDP to a majority government in the 1981 election, and Uruski was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Interlake. He returned to cabinet on November 30, 1981, as Minister of Agriculture. Until August 20, 1982, he also held responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act. Uruski attempted to develop his party&#x27;s support base in rural Manitoba while serving as Agriculture Minister, though he had little success to this end. However, he had more success in opening Manitoba hog production to the American marketplace.

On September 21, 1987, Uruski was again made Minister of Municipal Affairs with responsibility for the MPIC. Early in 1988, the NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature when backbench MLA Jim Walding voted with the opposition in an evenly divided house. Uruski was one of only twelve New Democrats re-elected in the election which followed, and formally stepped down from cabinet with the resignation of the Pawley government on May 9, 1988. The PCs, who won the most seats, formed a minority government with tacit NDP support against a Liberal opposition. He did not seek re-election in 1990.

Uruski was known as a promoter of Indigenous issues during his time in government (his riding had a large Indigenous population). In 1995, he was among the first to investigate alleged connections between the supposedly autonomous Independent Native Voice party and the Progressive Conservatives, after reports circulated that Interlake INV candidate Darryl Sutherland was running at the behest of local Tory interests with the intent of splitting the NDP vote. These allegations would become public three years later, and a public inquiry would rule that, in fact, local Tory organizers had persuaded Sutherland to run. In the 1999 provincial election, Uruski served as the NDP campaign manager in Interlake, supervising the successful campaign of party candidate Tom Nevakshonoff.

Uruski later became part of the &quot;Manitoba Rural Adaptation Council Incorporated&quot;. He also returned to farming and served on the board of the &quot;Manitoba Turkey Producers&quot; organization. In 2003, he represented the &quot;Poultry Welfare Coalition&quot; in a presentation to the Senate of Canada. He has criticized the tactics of the Monsanto Company in expanding their corporate base in the Canadian prairies. From 2006 to 2009, Uruski served as chairman of the Manitoba Cattle Enhancement Council.

<doc id="1166596" wikidata="Q16258517" url="?curid=1166596" title="Vocational Education Committee">
<text>A Vocational Education Committee (VEC) () was a statutory local education body in Ireland that administered some secondary education, most adult education and a very small amount of primary education in the state. Before 1992 VECs had authority over the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Regional Technical Colleges. They existed from 1930 to 2013, when they were replaced by Education and Training Boards.

==Establishment==
VECs were originally created by the Vocational Education Act 1930, as successors to the Technical Instruction Committees established by the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899. The original purpose of the committees was to administer continuation and technical education for 14- to 16-year-olds. Continuation education was defined as &quot;general and practical training in preparation for employment in trades&quot;, while technical education was described as &quot;pertaining to trades, manufacturers, commerce and other industrial pursuits&quot;. To this end the VECs were charged with the duty of setting up and maintaining vocational schools.

==Duties==
Over time the duties of VECs increased, in particular in the area of adult education. These included:

&quot;Post-primary (secondary) education&quot;
*Vocational Schools
*Community Colleges

&quot;Further and adult education&quot;
*Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs)
*Youthreach Services
*Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)
*Community Education
*Adult Literacy and Basic Education
*Back To Education Initiative (BTEI)
*Adult Refugee Programme (ARP)

VECs also administered maintenance grants and bursaries for third-level education until 2012.

In September 2008, County Dublin VEC opened the first Community National School, in Porterstown, Dublin 15. This marked the first time a VEC had become involved in primary school education.

==Organisation==
VECs were originally established in each administrative county and county borough in the then Irish Free State. In addition, a VEC was formed in those municipal boroughs and urban districts which had a separate Technical Instruction Committee under the 1899 legislation (namely Bray, Drogheda, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford) and in the newly created Borough of Dún Laoghaire.

The number of VECs was reduced to the final number of thirty-three when five town committees were amalgamated with the adjacent county committees, leaving Dún Laoghaire as the only VEC area not consisting of a city or county.

===Committees===
Each Vocational Education Committee was elected by the county, borough or urban district council and consisted partly of councillors and partly of persons with an &quot;interest and experience in education&quot; and who could be recommended by bodies &quot;interested in manufacture or trades&quot;.

The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 changed the composition of the committees, and parents of students under 18 and members of the staff were also entitled to elect committee members. Members could also be appointed to represent the interests of students, voluntary organisations, community organisations, Irish language interests and business.

==List of Vocational Education Committees 1997–2013==
==Amalgamations and abolition==
In October 2010 the Department of Education announced that the number of VECs was to be reduced from 33 to 16 by amalgamation In 2011 the new government confirmed that scale of reduction but revised the scheme of amalgamations It subsequently announced the establishment of SOLAS, a new steering and funding agency to cover the further education provision of the VECs, which also absorbed the training activities formerly carried out by FÁS.

Under the terms of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 the VECs were dissolved, being replaced by 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) on 1 July 2013:

# County Dublin VEC and Dún Laoghaire VEC replaced by Dublin &amp; Dún Laoghaire ETB

<doc id="1166599" wikidata="Q225959" url="?curid=1166599" title="Guard Hussar Regiment (Denmark)">
<text>The Guard Hussar Regiment () is a cavalry unit of the Royal Danish Army, whose primary task is to train the Guard Hussars for various functions in the mobilisation force. The Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two active cavalry regiments of the Danish Army, and was formed in 2001 through the amalgamation of the original Guard Hussars regiment, Zealand Life Regiment and Danish Life Regiment.

==History==
=== Origins of the regiment===

Although the Guard Hussars themselves date from 10 February 1762, the Danish Army takes the date of the founding of a regiment from its oldest part, in this case the Zealand Life Regiment, which was founded in 1614. This makes the Guard Hussars one of the oldest regiments of hussars in the world still operational, it is also the only hussars in mounted parade uniform to still wear the slung and braided pelisse which was formerly characteristic of this class of cavalry. In addition to its operational role, the Guard Hussar Regiment is one of two regiments in the Danish Army (along with the Den Kongelige Livgarde) to be classed as &#x27;Guards&#x27;; in this case, the Mounted Squadron perform the same role as the Household Cavalry do in the British Army.

From 1961 to 1972 the regiment was responsible for two armoured battalions, one recon battalion. From 1972–2000 the regiment was responsible for one armoured, one mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and one infantry battalions. From 2000–2004 the regiment was responsible for two armoured, two mechanised infantry, one reconnaissance and two infantry battalions. From 1992–2004 the regiment also had to form two light Reconnaissance Squadrons assigned to the 1st Zealand Brigade and Danish International Brigade.

=== 2001 amalgamation===

As part of the Defence Agreement 2000–04, it was decided to merge the Guard Hussar Regiment with the Zealand Life Regiment and the Danish Life Regiment. With this amalgamation of the three infantry regiments, the name and history of the new regiment had to be decided. This led to what the media called &quot;the Colonels&#x27; War&quot; (), with the three colonels fighting for their regiment’s name and history to survive.
The Chief of Defence, Christian Hvidt, ordered the old insignia removed, which was not customary. The new armoured horse head was nicknamed the &quot;biker patch&quot;. Furthermore, it was decided that a colour be used alongside the standard.

===Modern times===
Following the amalgamation, the Guard Hussar Regiment has participated in a number of international missions, resulting in the loss of 16 soldiers.

==Structure==

=== Current units ===
Today the Gardehusarregiment is classed as a cavalry regiment, it is in fact a mixed armoured and infantry unit, with three battalions:

<doc id="1166600" wikidata="Q3114621" url="?curid=1166600" title="Grand Trunk Western Railroad">
<text>The Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company was an American subsidiary of the Grand Trunk Railway, later of the Canadian National Railway operating in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Since a corporate restructuring in 1971, the railroad has been under CN&#x27;s subsidiary holding company, the Grand Trunk Corporation. Grand Trunk Western&#x27;s routes are part of CN&#x27;s Michigan Division. Its primary mainline between Chicago and Port Huron, Michigan serves as a connection between railroad interchanges in Chicago and rail lines in eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States. The railroad&#x27;s extensive trackage in Detroit and across southern Michigan has made it an essential link for the automotive industry as a hauler of parts and automobiles from manufacturing plants.

==Early history==
Grand Trunk Western grew out of a collection of 19th century Michigan rail lines which included: 
*Bay City Terminal Railway
*Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railroad
*Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway
*Chicago, Kalamazoo and Saginaw Railway
*Chicago and Kalamazoo Terminal Railroad
*Chicago and Lake Huron
*Chicago and Northeastern
*Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway
*Detroit and Huron Railway
*Grand Rapids Terminal Railroad
*Michigan Air Line Railway
*Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company
*Peninsular Railway of Michigan and Indiana
*Pontiac, Oxford and Northern Railroad
*Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway

===Mainline===
Grand Trunk Western began as a route for the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) to link its line to Chicago through lower Michigan. GTR&#x27;s objective was to have a mainline from shipping ports in Portland, Maine, to rail connections in Chicago through the southern part of the Province of Canada that would serve Toronto and Montreal.

In 1859 the Grand Trunk completed its route to Sarnia, Canada West, and began a ferry service across the St. Clair River to Port Huron. GTR leased the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railroad to reach Detroit and from there then ran over the Michigan Central Railroad&#x27;s line from Detroit into Chicago. It was on the line from Port Huron to Detroit that a 12-year-old Thomas Edison held his first job as a newsboy and candy butcher onboard passenger trains. Grand Trunk established its own route to Chicago across Michigan when the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s William Henry Vanderbilt took over control of the Michigan Central in 1878. GTR sought to put together a route by acquiring three railroads it had already been sending some of its Chicago-bound trains on since 1877. The Chicago and Lake Huron Railroad, the Chicago and Northeastern Railroad (C&amp;NE) and the Peninsular Railway of Michigan and Indiana together formed a direct route from Port Huron through Flint and Lansing, Michigan, to Valparaiso, Indiana, where it connected into Chicago on the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago Railroad. However, Vanderbilt owned the Chicago and Northeastern section of the route from Flint to Lansing and charged Grand Trunk higher rates to move its freight over the line. Vanderbilt soon sold the C&amp;NE to Grand Trunk when GTR bought the other two lines in 1879 and proposed building its own route between Flint and Lansing just north of Vanderbilt&#x27;s line. Grand Trunk completed its own route into Chicago from Valparaiso in 1880 and incorporated the entire line from Port Huron to Chicago as the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway.

===More routes===
Over the next two decades through either leases or purchases Grand Trunk acquired several other branch lines in Michigan. It took control of the Michigan Air Line Railway through a lease in 1881. The line connected with the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction at Richmond, Michigan, and ran to Jackson, Michigan, through Romeo and Pontiac. When Grand Trunk purchased the Great Western Railway in 1882 it also acquired the Detroit Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH&amp;M), which Great Western had owned since 1877. The DGH&amp;M gave Grand trunk a route from Detroit through Pontiac, Durand and Grand Rapids to Grand Haven, Michigan, where it began its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations in 1902. The DGH&amp;M connected with the Chicago and Grand Trunk at Durand and with the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction in Detroit. Durand became a major junction point for Grand Trunk when it continued to increase its mileage. It acquired the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway from Ashley, Michigan, to Muskegon, Michigan, in 1888. GTR obtained trackage rights to reach the line at Ashley from Owosso, Michigan, with the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway, the predecessor of the Ann Arbor Railroad. Grand Trunk acquired a route into Saginaw, Michigan, in 1890 with the lease of the Cincinnati, Saginaw &amp; Mackinaw Railroad from Durand to Bay City, Michigan. The line was the last to be held as a leased property until January 1943, when it was fully merged into Grand Trunk Western.

===Western Division===
By 1900 Grand Trunk united the operations of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway and all of its lines in Michigan, Illinois and Indiana under a subsidiary company called the Grand Trunk Western &quot;Railway&quot; Company. The name derived from the fact that GTR&#x27;s rail lines west of the St. Clair and Detroit rivers were referred to as its &quot;Western Division&quot;. The lines had also operated under the name Grand Trunk Railway System.
Pontiac also continued to become another important junction point when the Pontiac Oxford and Northern Railroad was acquired in 1909. It ran north from Pontiac to Caseville in Michigan&#x27;s thumb region. By 1910, GTW had a network of trackage connecting all of lower Michigan&#x27;s major manufacturing cities when it acquired a lease on a short branch of the Chicago, Kalamazoo and Saginaw Railroad giving it access to Kalamazoo, Michigan. A few years before, in 1902, GTW had gained access into Ohio with its shared ownership of the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad. The line was a small carrier that had a multi-track mainline bridging Detroit and Toledo, Ohio, and was purchased equally by GTW and the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad, a predecessor of the Nickel Plate Road. GTW eventually took complete control of the line when it bought Nickel Plate&#x27;s half interest from its successor Norfolk and Western Railway in 1981.

===Terminal railroads===
Grand Trunk Western also owned or co-owned terminal switching railroad companies in some of the cities it operated in. Beginning in 1905, it co-owned equal shares of the Detroit Terminal Railroad with New York Central (NYC). By the 1970s Detroit Terminal was suffering financial losses, and GTW negotiated to sell its share to NYC&#x27;s successors Penn Central and Conrail until it dropped its ownership in 1981. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, it acquired the Grand Rapids Terminal Railroad in 1906. In Bay City, Michigan, it owned the Bay City Terminal Railway and in Kalamazoo it took over the nearly Chicago and Kalamazoo Terminal Railroad by 1910. Prior to moving its ferry operations to Muskegon, GTW also acquired the railway belt-line Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company in 1924. The company existed as a GTW subsidiary until 1955. For its entry into Chicago GTW, along with the Erie, Wabash, Chicago and Eastern Illinois and Monon railroads, was a co-owner of the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad (C&amp;WI), beginning in 1883. It performed passenger and express car-switching duties at Chicago&#x27;s Dearborn Station. GTW was also part of a group that created and shared ownership in the Belt Railway Company of Chicago, which connects every rail line in the Chicago area.

===Canadian National===
By 1919, GTW&#x27;s parent, Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, was suffering financial problems related to its ownership of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The Canadian government nationalized Grand Trunk and other financially troubled Canadian rail companies by 1923 and amalgamated them into a new government-owned entity, the Canadian National Railway. GTW became a subsidiary of the new entity and was reincorporated as the Grand Trunk Western &quot;Railroad&quot; Company on November 1, 1928, when nearly all of its lines were formally merged under the company.

===River tunnel===

GTW&#x27;s predecessor Grand Trunk Railway also sought to expedite its rail service between Port Huron and Sarnia by constructing the world&#x27;s first international submarine rail tunnel under the St. Clair River. The St. Clair Tunnel, completed in 1891, approximately long and hand-dug, allowed Grand Trunk to discontinue its ferry service across the river. The tunnel was the last link in GTR&#x27;s complete mainline from Chicago through southern Canada. In 1992, Canadian National began construction of a new, larger tunnel next to the original tunnel to accommodate double-stacked intermodal containers and tri-level auto carriers used in freight train service. The new tunnel was completed in 1994 and dedicated on May 5, 1995. GTW also gained trackage rights in 1975 to use Penn Central&#x27;s Detroit River Tunnel between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Penn Central&#x27;s successor Conrail sold the tunnel to CN and Canadian Pacific Railway in 1985. Eventually, CN sold its share of the Detroit tunnel in 2000 after the new St. Clair tunnel was completed.

The railroad&#x27;s first major line abandonment came in 1951 when it abandoned about half of the former Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway line from Muskegon to Greenville, Michigan. That same year, Grand Trunk Western bought its headquarters building at 131 West Lafayette Avenue in downtown Detroit. At the end of 1970, GTW operated of track on of road, and that year it reported 2,732 million net revenue ton-miles of freight and 49 million passenger-miles.

==Grand Trunk Corporation==
After several years of Canadian National subsidizing the financial losses of Grand Trunk Western, a new holding company would be established by CN in 1971 to manage GTW. The Grand Trunk Corporation was created to shift full control of GTW operations to Detroit and begin a strategy to make the railroad profitable. CN&#x27;s other American properties, the Central Vermont Railway and the Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway (DW&amp;P), would also be placed under the new corporation initially for tax purposes.
With the new corporation came a new autonomy for GTW from its parent CN. Grand Trunk Western had always shared equipment, color schemes and corporate logos with Canadian National. It shared CN&#x27;s herald styles with its own name on the previous &quot;tilted herald&quot; and &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; logos. In 1960, when CN launched its new image, GTW had its own initials incorporated into the &quot;wet noodle&quot; logo and followed with CN&#x27;s black red/orange and gray locomotive color scheme. However, to show its new autonomy from CN, in 1971 GTW began receiving its new locomotives in its famous bright-blue, red/orange and white scheme. Most of GTW&#x27;s freight cars also received the blue and white color scheme. With new management, the railroad implemented a new strategy to market to shippers and improve its performance. In 1975, the railroad adopted its company slogan: &quot;The Good Track Road.&quot; This slogan promoted GTW&#x27;s track maintenance efforts at a time when many Eastern and Midwest railroads suffered from deferred maintenance. The company also encouraged better safety practices, which earned it the E.H. Harriman Award for safety five times in the 1980s.

===Detroit, Toledo and Ironton merger===
Part of the railroad&#x27;s new strategy in the 1970s and 1980s was to seek new routes to expand and compete in the long-haul railroad market. After Conrail took over the railroad operations of Penn Central in 1976, the Penn Central Corporation sought to divest itself of its subsidiary, the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad (DT&amp;I). After petitioning the Interstate Commerce Commission, GTW won approval over a joint bid by Norfolk and Western and Chessie System to acquire the DT&amp;I in June, 1980. The acquisition increased GTW&#x27;s trackage around Detroit&#x27;s industries, including Ford Motor Company&#x27;s large River Rouge Complex, DT&amp;I&#x27;s classification hump yard in Flat Rock, Michigan and routes south into Ohio with access to rail interchanges in Cincinnati, Ohio. As part of the ICC&#x27;s approval, GTW was obligated to divest its half or buy Norfolk and Western&#x27;s share in the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line. It purchased N&amp;W&#x27;s share in April 1981 for $1.9 million and completely merged the line into GTW later that same year.

===Milwaukee Road===
Grand Trunk Western sought to further expand its trackage by seeking to purchase one of the bankrupt Midwest railroads, the Milwaukee Road or the Rock Island, in the 1970s. After inspecting the Rock Island&#x27;s property and finding its trackage in need of costly repairs, GTW turned its attention in 1981 to acquiring the Milwaukee Road. GTW saw the acquisition of the Milwaukee Road (shorn of its Pacific Coast Extension and many of its midwestern branchlines) as an opportunity to expand its route further south and west to rail interchanges in Kansas City, Missouri, and Louisville, Kentucky. It would also afford GTW the opportunity to connect directly with its corporate cousin, the DW&amp;P, at Duluth, Minnesota. Instead of initially placing a bid for the Milwaukee Road and seeking immediate ICC approval, GTW embarked on a strategy to improve the line&#x27;s revenue and track maintenance. GTW and Milwaukee Road would enter into a &quot;voluntary coordination agreement&quot; where GTW would direct more of its shipments over the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s route. It would also launch a marketing effort promoting the merger. However, as the Milwaukee Road became more successful, two other potential bidders, the Soo Line Railroad and the Chicago and North Western Railway, petitioned the ICC to purchase the railroad. Despite GTW&#x27;s efforts, the ICC rejected its bid and, after a further bidding war between the Soo and the C&amp;NW, approved the Soo Line&#x27;s acquisition of the Milwaukee Road. The two roads were merged in January, 1986.

===Improving efficiency and downsizing===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Grand Trunk Western would continue to improve its efficiency and embark on efforts to improve its operating ratio. It had consolidated some of its operations, including dispatching in Pontiac, locomotive maintenance in Battle Creek and railcar maintenance in Port Huron. Its intercity passenger train operations would be handed over to Amtrak on May 1, 1971. Responsibility for GTW&#x27;s commuter rail operation in Detroit was turned over in 1974 to the regional transportation authority SEMTA. GTW moved into the intermodal freight business by creating intermodal transfer yards in Chicago in 1975, and suburban Detroit in 1978. The railroad&#x27;s president at the time, John H. Burdakin, was also a proponent of the Automatic Car Identification (ACI) system. It was a means to identify the location of shipments and equipment with bar code labels on the sides of freight cars and locomotives. The labels were read by automatic scanners at various rail yards. When Conrail was formed in 1976, GTW sought to acquire some of its routes in Michigan. It gained 151 miles (243 km) of trackage between Saginaw and Bay City as well as near Muskegon and Midland, Michigan. Several of GTW&#x27;s cuts in its expenditures came from reductions in its workforce through changes it negotiated in union work rules. In 1978, it discontinued its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations after several years of annual financial losses of over $1 million. By 1987, the company sold its headquarters building on Lafayette Avenue in Detroit and moved to the new office-park complex Brewery Park. The complex was developed on the site of the former Stroh&#x27;s Brewery near downtown Detroit. Locomotive performance was also enhanced with a rebuilding program of its EMD GP9s.
By the 1990s, several miles of routes and facilities were abandoned or sold to regional rail companies. GTW would eliminate all of the former Pontiac, Oxford and Northern line north of General Motors&#x27; Lake Orion manufacturing plant by 1985. In 1987, the former Cincinnati, Saginaw, and Mackinaw and the former Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee routes north of Durand were sold to the Central Michigan Railway. Elsdon Yard, GTW&#x27;s primary terminal and rail yard in Chicago, had been downsized and closed by 1990. It had also sold almost the entire route of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton in 1997 to the shortline rail operator Railtex. By 1998, it had abandoned the entire former Michigan Air Line route except for a portion in Oakland County, Michigan, which it sold to Coe Rail. With the end of SEMTA commuter rail service to downtown Detroit, in 1983, GTW abandoned and sold its trackage from the Milwaukee Junction area to downtown Detroit. That line was the former route to Brush Street Station and its railcar ferry dock on the Detroit River. It is known as the Dequindre Cut, which has been transformed into an urban greenway rail trail. By the year 2000, engine terminals and maintenance facilities had also been eliminated or downsized in Chicago, Detroit, Durand, Pontiac, Port Huron and Battle Creek.

===CN North America===

In December 1991, Canadian National announced a corporate image and restructuring program to consolidate all of its U.S. railroads under the CN North America brand. Grand Trunk Western, 
along with other CN owned subsidiaries, would see their images replaced with the CN logo and name. All GTW corporate identification and that of its new corporate cousins, the Illinois Central Railroad (acquired by CN in 1999) and Wisconsin Central Ltd. (acquired by CN in 2001), are referred-to with CN&#x27;s name and corporate image. However, while each railroad&#x27;s locomotives would eventually receive CN&#x27;s logo and black, red-orange and white paint scheme, they would still retain their respective reporting marks. Despite the corporate re-branding, GTW&#x27;s blue color scheme and its logo would persist on rolling stock and locomotives for several years while they were slowly either repainted or retired. CN also reintegrated managerial and some operational control of GTW, as it would gradually shift out of Detroit and into CN headquarters in Montreal. GTW would continue to maintain some office and dispatching functions from offices in suburban Troy, Michigan. All the routes that make up GTW are part of CN&#x27;s Midwest Division in its Michigan Zone. Grand Trunk Corporation, now formally headquartered at CN in Montreal, is the holding company for almost all of CN&#x27;s U.S. properties, which include Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Wisconsin Central, Duluth, Winnipeg &amp; Pacific and Great Lakes Transportation, which includes the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway. The Association of American Railroads has considered the Grand Trunk Corporation as a single, non-operating Class I Railroad since 2002. Grand Trunk Western still exists as a corporate entity, but can now be considered a company on paper. CN refers to GTW&#x27;s routes and operations in its corporate communications as &quot;the former Grand Trunk Western territory.&quot;

==Locomotives==
===Steam===
Grand Trunk Western was one of the last U.S. railroads to employ steam locomotives. It ran the last scheduled steam passenger train in the United States on March 27, 1960, on its train #21 from Detroit&#x27;s Brush Street Station north to Durand Union Station. The run drew thousands of rail enthusiasts. With 3,600 passengers holding tickets, train #21 had to be run in two sections (as two separate trains) to accommodate the excess of passengers. GTW U-3-b class Northern-type locomotive 6319 led the first section of train #21 with 15 passenger cars, and GTW Northern 6322 pulled the second section with 22 passenger cars. Steam was used on some freight trains until 1961. 
GTW&#x27;s predecessor lines primarily used American-type locomotives before the turn of the 20th century. Throughout its history, GTW has shared the same type and class designations of its locomotives with parents Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian National. Its locomotive road numbers would also be integrated into CN&#x27;s roster sequence. By the first half of the 20th century, the railroad&#x27;s largest steam power would be its Northern type locomotives, called Confederations by CN. The locomotives, built by the American Locomotive Company in the 1930s and 1940s, had driving wheels with 60,000 pounds of tractive effort and would be used in mainline freight and passenger service. Six GTW U-4-b class s built by Lima Locomotive Works would have streamlined shrouding and driving wheels, to be used only in passenger service.

Other steam locomotives in GTW&#x27;s fleet at the time included the Mikado type 2-8-2s built by Baldwin Locomotive Works and Alco, primarily used in mainline freight service. Pacific type and Mountain type locomotives, also built by Baldwin and Alco in the 1920s, and Ten-Wheelers built around 1900 began in mainline service but later were eventually both found mostly on branch lines and mixed train service. GTW also had a variety of other models of steam engines, including several 0-8-0 and 0-6-0 switching locomotives used to move rolling stock around in rail yards.

====Surviving steam locomotives====
Some of GTW&#x27;s steam engines survive today as static park displays or in operation. Three are park displays in Michigan; they include two &quot;Pacifics&quot; at Durand and Jackson and an at Sidney Montcalm Community College Heritage Village. Steamtown National Historic Site has GTW No. 6039, a U-1-c class Mountain type. The Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois, has U-3-b class No. 6323, which was the last GTW steam locomotive to operate in regular service, and P-5-g class No. 8380 as part of its collection. Locomotive No. 4070, an S-3-a class Light Mikado, has been used in excursion service by the Midwest Railway Preservation Society and was being restored back to service in Cleveland, Ohio. The Age of Steam Roundhouse in Sugarcreek, Ohio, possesses U-3-b class No. 6325, which was previously restored and operated on the Ohio Central System from 2001 until 2004. One of the two s in Michigan, K-4b 5632, is on display in Durand. J-3-b No. 5030 was purchased in February 2021 by the Colebrookdale Railroad, which has the intent of restoring it to operating condition after moving it to Boyertown, Pennsylvania. Although there was a third Pacific, K-4a 5629, that was used on excursions from the 1960s to 1970s, it was scrapped in July 1987, in Blue Island, Illinois.

===Diesel===

The first diesel locomotive to operate in regular service in Michigan arrived in 1938. It was GTW 7800, an EMC SC switching locomotive to work in Detroit. Previously, in 1925, GTW acquired from EMC an early motorized gasoline-electric railcar known as a Doodlebug. The cars were self-propelled units resembling a passenger car, with a baggage compartment and a coach section for passengers that GTW used on its Detroit to Port Huron and Richmond to Jackson routes until 1953. GTW also had another gasoline-electric locomotive referred to as a box-cab, built by Brill in 1926. Originally built for the Long Island Rail Road, GTW purchased it in 1934 and numbered it 7730. It was relegated to loading and unloading freight cars from GTW ferries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The unit was eventually converted to diesel power in 1939 and served in Milwaukee until 1960.

GTW continued to dieselize its locomotive fleet in the 1940s and 1950s, primarily with models from EMD, which was owned by one of GTW&#x27;s largest freight customers, General Motors. The exceptions were approximately 40 Alco S-2 and S-4 switching locomotives. Other diesel locomotives from EMD included several NW2s, SW900s and SW1200s, purchased for switching duties in rail yards and on branch lines. Grand Trunk Western&#x27;s first mainline road diesel locomotives were almost two dozen EMD F3As, acquired in 1948. They were followed in the 1950s by EMD GP9s and GP18s for freight and passenger service. The GP9s were rebuilt by GTW&#x27;s Battle Creek locomotive shops into GP9Rs, with improved internal components and modern low-nose cabs.

====Second-generation diesel locomotives====

The next new motive power to be acquired was the EMD SD40 in 1969. These were GTW&#x27;s first six-axle locomotives, and most lasted on GTW for at least four decades. GTW&#x27;s most-dominant diesel locomotive in its fleet was the EMD GP38. The first GP38s were delivered in 1971, and were also the first locomotives to wear GTW&#x27;s blue, red/orange and white scheme. It proved to be a versatile locomotive for GTW, used in switching and mainline service. The GP38AC was the first version to be purchased by GTW which had an alternating current alternator instead of the typical direct current generator. This was followed by the acquisition of several GP38-2s into the 1980s. GTW also purchased its new locomotives without dynamic brakes? since the company did not have any significant grades on its routes. GTW also inherited several locomotives, including its first GP40-2s, from its acquisition of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad. It also rostered its first EMD GP7s when it obtained full ownership of the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad, in 1981. GTW management found it cost-effective to lease or purchase second-hand diesel locomotives. It purchased several former Rock Island GP38-2s after that railroad closed in 1980. Union Pacific sold GTW several surplus former Missouri Pacific SD40-2s after it had acquired that railroad. It was also common for GTW and CN to share steam and diesel locomotives when either of them needed extra motive power. GTW also sent diesel locomotives for use to its fellow GTC subsidiary railways Central Vermont and Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific. , many GTW GP38s still wore their original blue, red/orange and white paint scheme and were found operating throughout CN&#x27;s other US subsidiaries. However, since 1991, CN gradually retired, sold or applied its own paint scheme to GTW locomotives. , the last GTW-painted SD40-2, 5936, was still operated by CN.

In November 2020, as part of the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of CN&#x27;s privatization, the company repainted some of its locomotive units in the schemes of the company&#x27;s predecessor and subsidiary railroads. EMD SD70-M2 No. 8952 was repainted in the blue and red livery of GTW, along with the logos of that company.

==Facilities==

Over its history, Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine terminals located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In each of these cities, GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance, including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1900, the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek, while railcar repair and maintenance was handled by GTW&#x27;s Port Huron car shops. The Battle Creek Shops were upgraded and modernized in 1907. The original Port Huron car shops were destroyed by fire in 1913 and rebuilt on a new 55-acre site at Griswold Road and 32nd Street. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard, located in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction points. There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad&#x27;s rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail, in 1976. 

On Chicago&#x27;s southwest side, GTW&#x27;s Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into the city in the 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junction Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975, GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as &quot;Railport.&quot; The facility is in Chicago&#x27;s Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976, when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called &quot;GT MoTerm&quot;. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton&#x27;s former hump classification yard in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT&amp;I. It still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and crossing gate towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.

==Passenger trains==

Grand Trunk Western&#x27;s primary passenger trains were the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, the &quot;International Limited&quot;, the &quot;Inter-City Limited&quot; and &quot;The LaSalle&quot;, which provided service between Chicago&#x27;s Dearborn Station and Toronto Union Station. In 1967, GTW introduced &quot;The Mohawk&quot; as a fast through train between Chicago and Brush Street Station in Detroit. Passenger operations were handed-over to Amtrak (National Railroad Passenger Corporation) on May 1, 1971. Amtrak&#x27;s Chicago to Port Huron trains, known as its &quot;Blue Water Service&quot;, operate over GTW&#x27;s route between Battle Creek and Port Huron.

The railroad also operated suburban commuter trains between downtown Detroit and Pontiac, Michigan, from August, 1931 until January 1974, when the now-defunct Southeast Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) took over operating the commuter trains. Amtrak&#x27;s Detroit–Chicago trains now originate or terminate over this former commuter line, making stops in the northern Detroit suburbs of Pontiac, Troy and Royal Oak, Michigan. Part of GTW&#x27;s former route in Detroit, to Brush Street Station and its railcar ferry dock known as the Dequindre Cut, has been transformed into an urban greenway rail trail.

==Car ferries==
===Lake Michigan===

Grand Trunk Western was one of three Michigan railroads, along with the Ann Arbor Railroad and Pere Marquette Railway, that operated separate railcar ferry service across Lake Michigan between Michigan and Wisconsin. Loading rail cars onto ships that had rails mounted to their decks, and ferrying the cars east and west across Lake Michigan, allowed railroads to bypass the congested rail interchanges in Chicago and move time-sensitive freight more quickly.

GTW&#x27;s ferry service was originally operated by the former Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH&amp;M), which Grand Trunk Railway acquired in 1882. DGH&amp;M initially had agreements with ferry companies operating on Lake Michigan to transfer its passengers and freight onto ships bound for Milwaukee from Grand Haven, Michigan. GTW&#x27;s rail car ferry service began in 1902 with an operating agreement with the steamship company, Crosby Transportation Company. The railway constructed ferry slip docks at Grand Haven and Milwaukee and had two steamships built, the SS &quot;Grand Haven&quot; and , capable of carrying 26 freight railcars. In 1905, Grand Trunk assumed Crosby&#x27;s interest and incorporated the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company to operate the ships. In Milwaukee, GTW interchanged rail cars with the Milwaukee Road, Chicago and North Western and the Soo Line. The ownership of the ferry company was shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from 1927 until 1954, and sailed as the &quot;Grand Trunk-Pennsylvania Route&quot;. The SS &quot;Milwaukee&quot; sank, loaded with rail cars, in a storm after departing Milwaukee in October, 1929, with everyone aboard lost. Three new ships, the &quot;Grand Rapids&quot;, &quot;Madison&quot;and the &quot;City of Milwaukee&quot;, constructed between 1926 and 1931, replaced the &quot;Grand Haven&quot; and &quot;Milwaukee&quot;. The ships required a crew of 34 and, with strengthened ice-breaking hulls, operated year-round. At PRR&#x27;s request, GTW moved its Michigan docks to Muskegon, Michigan, in 1937, where its subsidiary, the Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company, initially operated ferry loading and switching operations. GTW had also changed its route into Muskegon, with trackage rights over PRR&#x27;s line from Grand Rapids.

By 1968, GTW was shipping over of freight a year across Lake Michigan. However, the ferry service began running deficits of over $1 million annually in the 1970s and, in 1975, GTW petitioned the ICC to end the service. Permission was eventually granted, and the last ferry sailed on October 31, 1978.

===River ferries===
====St. Clair River====
The first river ferry service began in 1860, when the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s tracks reached Sarnia, Ontario, and it had to transfer its passengers and freight across the St. Clair River to Port Huron, and onto the Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railroad to Detroit or its Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway route to Chicago. GTR started its St. Clair River ferry service with a type of swing ferry-barge. The barge was anchored by of chain. When the barge was loaded, it was released into the current to dock on the opposite side of the river. When this proved unreliable, Grand Trunk replaced it with the wood-burning steamer &quot;International II&quot; in 1872. It soon was joined in service by the steamer &quot;Huron&quot;. The ferries continued until 1891, when Grand Trunk completed its rail tunnel connecting Sarnia and Port Huron under the river. However, GTW and CN reinstated the ferry service 80 years later, in 1971, with its &quot;Rail-Barge&quot; service to accommodate the larger freight railcars that were higher than the 1891 tunnel&#x27;s height clearance. The St. Clair river barges discontinued service again in 1995, after the new, larger St Clair Tunnel was completed.

====Detroit River====
Grand Trunk&#x27;s river ferry service on the Detroit River connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario was also inherited from its 1882 purchase of the Great Western Railway. Great Western&#x27;s ferry service began after its rails reached Windsor in 1853. Because Great Western&#x27;s track gauge of was different from the standard American gauge of , it had to transfer its cargo off railcars and onto the ships. By the 1860s, Great Western made its railway dual gauge by adding a third rail to its tracks to accommodate rail cars of both gauges. Its first side-wheel steam ferry, the &quot;Great Western&quot;, arrived in 1866, and when first launched was the largest steel vessel on the Great Lakes. The Wabash Railroad contracted with Grand Trunk in 1897 to use its ferry service to connect Wabash&#x27;s own route from Detroit through Southwest Ontario to Buffalo, New York. Wabash started its own service after 1910, when it acquired Michigan Central&#x27;s ferries after that railroad opened the Detroit River Tunnel. Eventually, GTW&#x27;s parent CN took over sole responsibility for ferry operations on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. The Detroit River ferry operation ceased running in 1975, when GTW was granted trackage rights to use Penn Central&#x27;s Detroit River Tunnel to connect with CN in Windsor. The start of construction of the Renaissance Center in Detroit in 1973 necessitated the removal of GTW&#x27;s Detroit ferry-slip docks.
During the more than 130 years of rail car ferry operations on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers, all the major railroads, including Michigan Central, Pere Marquette, Wabash and Canadian Pacific, had ferry operations on the Detroit River. The GTW/CN rail car ferry service was the last to operate in the Great Lakes when it ended operations on the St Clair River in 1995.

<text>The Arbroath smokie is a type of smoked haddock named after the town of Arbroath in Angus, Scotland.

== History ==
The Arbroath smokie is said to have originated in the small fishing village of Auchmithie, three miles northeast of Arbroath. Local legend has it a store caught fire one night, destroying barrels of haddock preserved in salt. The following morning, the people found some of the barrels had caught fire, cooking the haddock inside. Inspection revealed the haddock to be quite tasty. It is much more likely the villagers were of Scandinavian descent, as the &#x27;Smokie making&#x27; process is similar to smoking methods which are still employed in areas of Scandinavia.

Towards the end of the 19th century, as Arbroath&#x27;s fishing industry died, the Town Council offered the fisherfolk from Auchmithie land in an area of the town known as the &quot;fit o&#x27; the toon&quot;. It also offered them use of the modern harbour. Much of the Auchmithie population then relocated, bringing the Arbroath Smokie recipe with them. Today, 15 local businesses produce Arbroath smokies, selling them in major supermarkets in the UK and online.

In 2004, the European Commission registered the designation &quot;Arbroath smokies&quot; as a Protected Geographical Indication under the EU&#x27;s Protected Food Name Scheme, acknowledging its unique status.

==Preparation==

Arbroath smokies are prepared using traditional methods dating back to the late 1800s.

The fish are first salted overnight. They are then tied in pairs using hemp twine, and left overnight to dry. Once they have been salted, tied and dried, they are hung over a triangular length of wood to smoke. This &quot;kiln stick&quot; fits between the two tied smokies, one fish on either side. The sticks are then used to hang the dried fish in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire.

When the fish are hung over the fire, the top of the barrel is covered with a lid and sealed around the edges with wet jute sacks (the water prevents the jute sacks from catching fire). All of this serves to create a very hot, humid and smoky fire. The intense heat and thick smoke is essential if the fish are to be cooked, not burned, and to have the strong, smoky taste and smell people expect from Arbroath smokies. Typically in less than an hour of smoking, the fish are ready to eat.

<doc id="1166609" wikidata="Q6335576" url="?curid=1166609" title="Tockington">
<text>Tockington is a village in South Gloucestershire, England. Historically the village developed around farming based mainly on the rearing of cattle on the fertile flood plains. In more recent times Tockington has become an attractive location for commuters, being situated within the Green Belt and well connected with Bristol. It is south of Olveston and is located in a steep valley. The village also has the Swan Inn, a popular pub. The centre of the village, where the pub is located is a triangular junction.

== History ==
In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Tockington like this:

TOCKINGTON (Lower), a tything in Almondsbury parish, Gloucester; 3¾ miles S by E of Thornbury. It has a post-office under Bristol, and cattle fairs on 9 May and 6 Dec. Real property, £4,975. Pop., 464. Houses, 109.

== Tockington Manor ==

Tockington Manor is a boarding preparatory school, which opened in 1947. The three-storey stone building was largely constructed around 1712 but incorporating elements of an earlier house. In World War I it was used as a hospital.

Before WWII it was privately owned by the Salmon family. At the outbreak of war it was commandeered as a dispersal site for the Bristol Engine Company&#x27;s design office. The estimated cost, largely for building a number of additional huts in the grounds, of £9,000 was considered too much, so the main office staff were instead moved to the Fry&#x27;s chocolate factory at Somerdale and only leading staff and their support staff, a total of 70, went to the Manor. Apartments were made for senior staff and after Roy Fedden, Bristol&#x27;s chief designer, was coincidentally bombed out of his house in Bristol on 25 September 1940, during a raid targeted on Bristol&#x27;s Filton factory, he took up permanent residence. Close House, Upper Tockington Road, was also used as a lodging house. The pre-war garden staff were kept on, now digging for victory to supply the kitchens.

The Tockington Manor office was where new engine developments were first planned. One of these had major significance, as Bristol&#x27;s first gas turbine engine, the Theseus turboprop. This was a source of great disagreement, as Fedden thought that Bristol should concentrate on existing piston engines, but was over-ruled by Frank Owner, Head of the Project Office. This led to Fedden&#x27;s resignation in 1942, at the height of the war.

Towards the end of the war, once the threat of air raids was over, the design office returned to Filton and afterwards the house was returned to the Salmon family. They sold the estate in 1946. The Manor was bought by ex first-class cricketer Major Tovey, who opened it as a private school. His son, Richard, later served as headmaster of the school for 38 years.

== Tockington Quarry ==
There is a small limestone quarry to the rear of the Manor. Along with the Manor this formed part of the pre-war Salmon estate. During the war, it was considered to use this quarry as an isolated and enclosed place for engine testing. In the end, Failand Quarry to the south-west was used instead. The quarry is now a climbing site.

==Amenities==

The hub of the village is &#x27;The Green&#x27; and where its church, pub and bus stop are all located. Next to the Swan Inn, a Grade II Listed Building, is an old style red phone box and which is used as a book swap.
The village church: Olveston and Tockington Methodist Church was formed in 2004 when the two former village churches united. The church, in the form of a Chapel, was built in 1897. The Chapel was extensively renovated in 2007 and now incorporates a toilet with disabled access and a kitchenette. At full capacity the Chapel seats 60. Its minister from 1 September 2018 is the Rev Simon Edwards. Services are held in the Chapel on Sundays at 10:00 am.

Tockington has no shops, but there are several farm shops in the surrounding area. There are also supermarkets and a large shopping mall at nearby Cribbs Causeway as well as those in the nearby town of Thornbury.

Bus services to and from Tockington are operated by Stagecoach Group Gloucester.

<doc id="1166612" wikidata="Q766741" url="?curid=1166612" title="Jeff Cunningham">
<text>Jeff Cunningham (born August 21, 1976) is a former professional soccer player who played as a forward. He is Major League Soccer&#x27;s third-all-time leader in regular-season goals scored with 134. Born in Jamaica, Cunningham initially played for the country of his birth before switching to the United States for which he played for the rest of his international career.

==Youth and college==
Cunningham was born in Jamaica, but moved to Crystal River, Florida, at the age of fourteen. He played college soccer at the University of South Florida from 1994 to 1997. As a sophomore and a junior, Cunningham was named first-team All-Conference USA, and as a senior he was named Conference USA Player of the Year. He finished his career at USF with forty-one goals and thirty-six assists. Cunningham was inducted to the USF Athletics Hall of Fame in August 2024.

==Club career==
Upon graduating, Cunningham was selected ninth overall in the 1998 MLS College Draft by the Columbus Crew. As a rookie, he played in twenty-five games, mostly as a substitute, and tied the rookie record for goals (since broken by Damani Ralph) with eight. Cunningham became a starter in 1999 and held that role for several years. In 182 games for Columbus, he scored sixty-two goals and notched forty-three assists. He was named to the MLS Best XI in 2002, after scoring sixteen goals and adding five assists. After a disappointing 2004 season Cunningham was traded to Colorado Rapids for a first-round 2006 MLS SuperDraft pick. He left the Crew tied with Brian McBride for the all-time team lead in goals.

Cunningham finished the 2005 season with twelve league goals for Colorado. He scored twice against Fulham F.C. of the Premier League in the 2005 MLS All-Star Game. His showing in an all-star game against Real Madrid also earned good reviews, despite MLS&#x27;s 5–0 loss. However, after the year Colorado shipped him to Real Salt Lake for Clint Mathis. Cunningham was seventh on the all-time MLS goalscoring list entering the 2006 season.

During the 2006 season Cunningham led the league in scoring with sixteen goals, winning the MLS Golden Boot. He also tied for the second-most assists in the league with eleven. Both totals (16 goals and 11 assists) set single-season records for the RSL franchise.

On May 22, 2007, Cunningham was dealt to Toronto FC in exchange for Alecko Eskandarian and a first-round draft pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft. In Toronto, he wore the number 96 to represent the 96 MLS goals he had scored after the conclusion of his first season with Toronto FC.

Cunningham fell out of favor in his second season with Toronto FC, missing scoring a goal line ball that would have taken Toronto to the CONCACAF Champions League. After the match, TFC coach John Carver said &quot;I am thinking, ‘How did he score 99 goals?’ That&#x27;s what I thought.’&quot;

On August 8, 2008, Cunningham was traded to FC Dallas in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. He scored in his first match with FC Dallas on August 16, 2008, in a 2–1 loss to the Columbus Crew. It was Cunningham&#x27;s 100th goal in MLS. Jeff played in 11 games with FC Dallas during the 2008 season scoring 5 goals.

Cunningham scored 17 goals in 2009, including four goals on August 1 against the Kansas City Wizards. After Kenny Cooper left the club for 1860 Munich, Cunningham emerged as the team&#x27;s go-to goal scorer. He netted seven goals in five games in September, winning MLS Player of the Month and went on to win the 2009 MLS Golden Boot. Cunningham ended the 2010 season as the #2 career regular season MLS goalscorer with 132 goals.

After the 2010 MLS season FC Dallas declined Cunningham&#x27;s contract option and Cunningham elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 15, 2010, Cunningham was selected by Columbus Crew in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft. Prior to Columbus re-signing him on January 28, 2011, Cunningham trained with Norwegian Premier League club IK Start and was rumored to be in talks for a permanent move, however no trade came to pass. His return to Columbus Crew was on February 22, 2011, in the second half of the Crew&#x27;s CONCACAF Champions League quarter final game against Real Salt Lake. On July 7, 2011, Cunningham scored his 133rd career MLS goal to tie the league&#x27;s all-time scoring record. The goal came in the 90th minute on a header to win a game against the Vancouver Whitecaps FC by a score of 1–0. He scored his 134th goal—a penalty kick in a 6–2 loss to Seattle Sounders FC—to claim the record outright on August 27.

At season&#x27;s end, Columbus declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Cunningham was not selected in the draft and became a free agent. In January 2012, Cunningham signed on with first division side and current runner up CSD Comunicaciones of Guatemala for the 2012 Torneo Clausura.

After his release by Comunicaciones, Cunningham signed with NASL club San Antonio Scorpions FC on July 23, 2012.

As of November 29, 2013, Cunningham was on trial with Vicem Hai Phong F.C. of Vietnam&#x27;s V.League 1.

==International career==
In 1999, Cunningham played for Jamaica in a friendly international against Ghana.

Cunningham became a U.S. citizen in November 2001, and received his first cap for the United States national team less than a month later, on December 9, in a friendly against South Korea. He made his first start in a World Cup qualifier on September 7, 2005, against Guatemala. After a four-year absence from the national team, Cunningham was called up by Bob Bradley for friendlies against Slovakia and Denmark in November 2009. In a friendly against Denmark on November 18, 2009, he scored his first career international goal.

==Personal life==
Jeff and his wife, Jocelyn have two children, Mikayla, born in 2008 and Eli born in 2014.

Cunningham became a naturalized U.S. citizen on November 13, 2001.

<text>This is a chronological list of works by Max Weber. Original titles with dates of publication and translated titles are given when possible, then a list of works translated into English, with earliest-found date of translation. The list of translations is most likely incomplete.

Weber wrote all his books in German. Original titles published after his death (1920) are likely to be compilations of unfinished works (note the term &#x27;Collected Essays...&#x27; in the titles). Many translations are of parts or selections from various German originals, and the names of the translations often do not reveal which German works they are drawn from.

<text>The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) is a creationist apologetics institute in Dallas, Texas, that specializes in media promotion of pseudoscientific creation science and interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a historical event. The ICR adopts the Bible as an inerrant and literal documentary of scientific and historical fact as well as religious and moral truths, and espouses a Young Earth creationist worldview. It rejects evolutionary biology, which it views as a corrupting moral and social influence and threat to religious belief. The ICR was formed by Henry M. Morris in 1972 following an organizational split with the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC).

Its work in the field of creation science has been rejected by science, but has been significant in shaping creationist thought in the United States by introducing creation science through fundamentalist churches and religious schools, and by engaging in public debates against supporters of evolution. The ICR also offers unaccredited graduate level programs in Biblical Apologetics, including a minor in Creation Research. The ICR also operates the ICR Discovery Center for Science &amp; Earth History museum in Dallas, Texas.

==History==

The origins of the ICR can be traced to the Creation Science Research Center set up by Henry M. Morris, along with Nell and Kelly Segraves, at the Christian Heritage College (now San Diego Christian College) in 1970. However, the Segraveses and Morris disagreed on the focus of the center, with the Segraveses favoring political and promotional activities, whilst Morris favored educational and scientific efforts. This led to the breakup of the center in 1972, with the Segraveses taking control of the center and severing ties with the university, with Morris reorganising the remaining staff into the Institute for Creation Research.

The ICR defined its work in terms of three ministries: research, writing and speaking. Historian of science Ronald L. Numbers states that &quot;[d]espite its name, the institute for years conducted little research outside the confines of its modest library&quot; and cites (founding member) Duane Gish as &quot;explain[ing] apologetically in 1978, [that] the staff devoted much of its research effort to scouring the scientific literature for references favorable to creationism.&quot; Numbers does note that it engaged in a number of archaeological and geological expeditions, including two in search of the mythical Noah&#x27;s Ark, with geologist Steven A. Austin, working as an &quot;off and on&quot; visiting scientist until taking a full staff position in 1979, single-handedly conducting most of its non-literary research. Influential scientific creationist Walter E. Lammerts complained that &quot;[t]he main trouble is that Henry looks at this whole thing as a sort of &#x27;missionary&#x27; effort rather than a scientific one.&quot; It maintained tax-exempt status as a religious institution carrying out &quot;non-scientific research.&quot;

In the early 1980s, the ICR severed its ties with Christian Heritage College to downplay its religious connections and portray itself as secular scientific institution. Ken Ham, a speaker and former high school science teacher in Australia, once worked for the ICR producing a series of seminars &quot;Back to Genesis&quot;. In 1994 Ham left ICR to found what would become Answers in Genesis (AiG). Currently, at least one ICR staff member is also on staff at AiG.

In 1985, the ICR helped Turkey&#x27;s education minister Vehbi Dinçerler, introduce Islamic creationism in Turkish high schools.

In 1987, the ICR&#x27;s statement of belief was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Edwards v. Aguillard. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote that &quot;If no valid secular purpose can be identified, then the statute violates the Establishment Clause.&quot; He continued noting information on ICR and Creation Research Society including &quot;a review of their goals and activities sheds light on the nature of creation science.&quot; He then explained, &quot;the intent of the Louisiana Legislature was to promote a particular religious belief&quot; and the court ruled that teaching creationism was unconstitutional.

In 1992, the ICR opened the Museum of Creation and Earth History. When the ICR moved from Santee, California to Dallas, Texas, the ICR sold the museum to the Life and Light Foundation, a non-profit ministry run by Tom Cantor, in 2008.

With the Creation Research Society, ICR released statements in 2005 about the RATE (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) project, providing a young-Earth creationist perspective on dating techniques like radiometric dating. RATE claimed that evidence supported over 500 million years of radiometric decay at today&#x27;s rates but that it also supported a young earth. It speculated that nuclear decay rates must have accelerated by a factor of approximately one billion on the first two days of the Creation week and during the Flood. Non-affiliated experts who have scrutinised the claims have unanimously rejected them as flawed, noting that the integrity of science was compromised in favor of a message affirming the reliability of the Bible. RATE was chaired by Larry Vardiman and included Steven A. Austin, John Baumgardner, Steven W. Boyd, Eugene F. Chaffin, Donald B. DeYoung, Russell Humphreys and Andrew Snelling.
In 2007, the institute relocated from Santee, California, to Dallas, Texas. Morris, who died the previous year, said the move was intended to give the ICR a central national location, Dallas&#x27; proximity to a major airport, and a larger population for their ministry. For FYE 2007, the Institute had net assets of $7,613,461. In 2009, the ICR had a revenue of $8,042,283 with net assets of $9,857,656.

On September 2, 2019, the ICR opened the ICR Discovery Center for Science &amp; Earth History museum in Dallas, Texas.

Morris&#x27;s son, Henry M. Morris III, died on December 12, 2020. The younger Morris had been ICR&#x27;s CEO.

==Research and publications==

In a 1995 review of work published by ICR researchers, Douglas J. Futuyma writes, &quot;Neither in the creationist literature nor in the scientific literature have I found any reference to professional research by these individuals in genetics, paleontology, taxonomy, anatomy, or any of the other fields most relevant to the study of evolution.&quot; He found their work most often published instead by an overtly religious publishing house, Creation-Life Publishers.

==Master Books==
Master Books is a division within Creation-Life Publishers, another enterprise Morris helped to found. It serves as the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and specializes in theology and creation science works. Master Books&#x27; anti-evolution books are in wide distribution, promoted by most of the large creationist organizations as well as the ICR.

==School and accreditation==
In June 1981, the ICR received formal state approval in California to offer degree programs in science. In 1988, the ICR sought re-approval. A five-person committee from the California Department of Education sent to evaluate ICR&#x27;s degree program found its graduate school consisted of only five full-time faculty and some courses were videotaped rather than professor-led instruction. The committee failed to grant re-approval by 3–2 vote, a move the ICR attributed to &quot;religious intolerance&quot; rather than criticisms of the quality of education it provided. This resulted in California&#x27;s State Superintendent of Public Instruction barring the institute from granting master&#x27;s degrees in science, which encompassed their existing graduate degree programs in the teaching of biology, geology, astrogeophysics and science.

ICR filed a lawsuit against California&#x27;s State Superintendent, Bill Honig, and was awarded a settlement of $225,000 permission to continue its program until 1995, so long as it continued to teach evolution alongside creationism. The original agreement expired in 1995, and California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE) granted the ICR religious exemption from postsecondary school requirements in California.

In 1982, the ICR received accreditation from the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), a private fundamentalist creationist schools accreditation agency. TRACS was officially recognized as an accreditor by the US Department of Education in 1991. Following the ICR&#x27;s move to Dallas, in November 2007, TRACS terminated its accredited status. Texas does not recognize TRACS&#x27; accreditation.

The ICR&#x27;s relocation to Texas required Texas state approval or accreditation by a regional accrediting agency, in this case Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). In 2007, the ICR applied for a temporary state certification there which would have allowed the institute to operate while it pursues accreditation through SACS. In December 2007, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) received an advisory committee recommendation to allow the ICR to start offering online master&#x27;s degrees in science education.

The Board originally planned to decide on the issue at their January 2008 meeting. At the time it applied, ICR graduate school had approximately 30 to 50 students, most teachers from private Christian schools or home-schoolers, and four full-time faculty.

After seeking the advice from an independent panel, the Chairman of the Texas Board requested information about the research conducted by the faculty, how an on-line program would expose students to the experimental side of science, and asked why &quot;[t]heir curriculum doesn&#x27;t line up very well with the curriculum available in conventional master of science programs.&quot; Subsequently, the ICR asked the THECB to delay its decision until their next meeting to give them time to respond. Inside Higher Ed reported &quot;lobbying — by scientists against the institute, and by others in its favor — is going strong.&quot;

&quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; obtained some of the messages sent to the board and published a number of examples and summaries that illustrated how intense the debate had become. Following the response from the ICR to the Board, Steven Schafersman, of the Texas Citizens for Science, reported that the ICR sent out &quot;prayer requests&quot; and is currently arguing a creationist derived distinction of science in their application for approval.

On April 23, 2008, education board&#x27;s Academic Excellence and Research Committee unanimously voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees citing &quot;the institute&#x27;s program is infused with creationism and runs counter to conventions of science that hold that claims of supernatural intervention are not testable and therefore lie outside the realm of science.&quot; On the following day the full Board unanimously voted against allowing the ICR to issue science degrees. The decision was &quot;based the recommendation on two considerations:
# ICR failed to demonstrate that the proposed degree program meets acceptable standards of science and science education.
# The proposed degree is inconsistent with Coordinating Board rules which require the accurate labeling or designation of programs … Since the proposed degree program inadequately covers key areas of science, it cannot be properly designated either as &#x27;science&#x27; or &#x27;science education.&#x27;&quot;

The ICR said it would appeal the decision saying the Education Board was guilty of &quot;viewpoint discrimination&quot;. Instead, in April 2009, the ICR sued the THECB in federal court for imposing &quot;an unconstitutional and prejudicial burden against ICRGS&#x27;s academic freedom and religious liberties&quot; and asked for the ability to award science degrees. In June 2010, a judge ruled in favor of the Texas Higher Education saying the ICR &quot;is entirely unable to file a complaint which is not overly verbose, disjointed, incoherent, maundering and full of irrelevant information.&quot; The judge concluded, &quot;The Court simply comes to the conclusion, which is inescapable, that the [THECB] decision was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.&quot; In the September 2010 ICR newsletter, Henry Morris III, the ICR&#x27;s chief executive officer, wrote &quot;ICR&#x27;s legal battle is over&quot; after the Judge ruled in favor of the Texas Board.

In 2010, the ICR board of directors voted to close the ICR Graduate School and open a School of Biblical Apologetics, offering a Master of Christian Education degree with Creation Research being one of four minors. The ICR noted that &quot;Due to the nature of ICR&#x27;s School of Biblical Apologetics — a predominantly religious education school — it is exempt from licensing by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

==Criticism==
===Scientific criticism===
Young-earth creationism is rejected by nearly all scientists, including most scientists who hold to the Christian faith, with more than 45 science organizations having criticized creationism as not science. Professor Massimo Pigliucci, a professor of ecology and evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, has criticized ICR for professing to present the same science as that taught in secular universities while at the same time requiring students and faculty to sign a statement of faith to ICR&#x27;s fundamentalist religious mission, most notably in affirming conformity in all its work to Biblical doctrine. Pigliucci notes that any research conducted within the ICR&#x27;s policy framework is prescribed at the outset by Biblical literalism, and thus antithetical to the methods and framework used by scientists. As examples, Pigliucci cites ICR scientist Harold Slusher resorting to non-Euclidean and non-Einsteinian explanations of light travel to reconcile the vast distances light travels in space with the brief timescale given in young earth creationism, and the association adopted by the ICR between the second principle of thermodynamics and the Bible&#x27;s account of the fall of Adam. Pigliucci further claimed that &quot;some of the historical claims found in the ICR museum are also stunning and show how easily ideology gets the better of accuracy.&quot;

On January 7, 2007, the National Center for Science Education reported that &quot;Grand Canyon: A Different View&quot;, edited by Tom Vail and published by Master Books, the publishing arm of the Institute for Creation Research, and described as promoting &quot;a young-earth creationist view of the geology of the Grand Canyon,&quot; was facing new scrutiny by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) in December 2006. The Chief of the Park Service&#x27;s Geologic Resources Division recommended its removal on grounds that it &quot;does not use accurate, professional and scholarly knowledge; is not based on science but a specific religious doctrine; does not further the public&#x27;s understanding of the Grand Canyon&#x27;s existence; [and] does not further the mission of the National Park Service&quot;. A report by the National Center for Science Education, written by Chemist Karen Bartelt was critical of the ICR representatives and displays in the &quot;museum&quot;.

===Criticism from old Earth creationists===
Old Earth creationists are opposed to the ICR. Gary North opposes the ICR on the grounds that they think the second principle of thermodynamics contradicts evolution, and John W. Robbins considers the ICR&#x27;s activities a &quot;fraud&quot;. The old-Earth creationist organization Answers In Creation criticizes the ICR, including a critical review by Kevin R. Henke of the ICR&#x27;s dating claims. Henke concluded that the ICR&#x27;s &quot;research&quot; was improperly conducted and &quot;was unsuccessful in adequately separating the volcanic glass from the much older minerals&quot;. Another creationist opponent of ICR and its doctrine is Hugh Ross, who accepts the scientific consensus of a 4.54 billion year old Earth and is critical of ICR&#x27;s cosmological models as well as their attempts to solve the starlight problem.

===Criticism over awarding degrees===
The ICR attracted much opposition when it sought approval (unsuccessfully) in Texas to operate a master&#x27;s degree program in science education. An April 2008 survey by Texas Freedom Network showed the majority of science faculties in Texas are opposed to ICR&#x27;s request to issue science degrees with 185 (95% of respondents) opposed to certifying the program and 6 (3%) in favor. Officials of the institute state their goal is to integrate Biblical creationism with science. Since their program is intended to prepare students who are or will become teachers, the developing program is controversial. In public statements, ICR officials said that scientific literacy would be emphasized, but science advocates critical of the ICR said the institute&#x27;s true goal is to restore religious creationism to science classes in the public schools. Texas declined to accredit the ICR science program (see above).

<text>Stanley John Weyman (pronounced [waɪ mæn], 7 August 1855 – 10 April 1928) was an English writer of historical romance. His most popular works were written in 1890–1895 and set in late 16th and early 17th-century France. While very successful at the time, they are now largely forgotten.

==Biography==
Stanley John Weyman was born on 7 August 1855 in Ludlow, Shropshire, the second son of a solicitor. He attended Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford, leaving in 1877 with a degree in Modern History. After a year&#x27;s teaching at the King&#x27;s School, Chester, he returned to Ludlow in December 1879 to live with his widowed mother.

Weyman was called to the bar in 1881, but had little success as a barrister, as he was shy, nervous and soft-spoken. However, his shortage of briefs gave him time to write. His short story &quot;King Pippin and Sweet Clive&quot; appeared in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, although its editor, James Payn, himself a novelist, told Weyman it would be easier to make a living writing novels. Weyman viewed himself as a historian and so he was particularly encouraged by positive notices for an article he wrote on Oliver Cromwell that was published in the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;.

Weyman&#x27;s ill-health prompted him in 1885 to spend several months in the South of France with his younger brother Arthur. In December of that year the brothers were arrested on suspicion of espionage at Aramits. A 24-page critical biography of Weyman published as an annex to an edition of his novel &quot;Ovington&#x27;s Bank&quot; (1922) suggests that this ordeal galvanised the thirty-year-old Weyman, who until then had scraped a meagre income writing short stories. His first novel, &quot;The House of the Wolf&quot;, was published in 1890. Like many of his successful works, it is set in the French religious wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

Weyman became a full-time writer in 1891. Four years later he married Charlotte Panting at Great Fransham, Norfolk, and moved with her to Ruthin in Wales, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Weyman died on 10 April 1928, his wife surviving him by four years; they had no children.

==Reputation==

Weyman in his day was publicly popular and admired by writers such as Robert Louis Stevenson and Oscar Wilde. In a 1970 BBC interview, Graham Greene said, &quot;The key books in my life included Anthony Hope, Rider Haggard, Captain Gilson and I do occasionally re-read them. Stanley Weyman in particular.&quot; Works like &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas had established a market for popular historical fiction and it was a crowded field. Contemporary rivals included Baroness Orczy, A. E. W. Mason, John Buchan and Rafael Sabatini.

The biographer Reginald Pound grouped Weyman with Arnold Bennett, Anthony Hope, Aldous Huxley, Dorothy L. Sayers and Somerset Maugham as &quot;Strand&quot; writers. He is now perhaps the least familiar of all these. His greatest success came before 1895 (&quot;Under the Red Robe&quot;, &quot;A Gentleman of France&quot; and &quot;The Red Cockade&quot;) and he stopped writing entirely between 1908 and 1919. His style and focus are more typical of Victorian writers, as are his faults. With odd exceptions such as Gil de Berault in &quot;Under the Red Robe,&quot; his characters are fairly uniform, his women caricatures, and his dialogue wooden to modern ears.

Weyman&#x27;s strength lies in historical detail, often in less familiar areas. &quot;The Long Night&quot; is based on the Duke of Savoy&#x27;s attempt to storm Geneva in December 1602, an event still celebrated annually in a festival called &quot;L&#x27;Escalade&quot;. Weyman received an award from the city for his research. The financial security of early success allowed him to choose subjects of personal interest. Some had less general appeal, such as the 1832 Reform Bill (treated in &quot;Chippinge&quot;), post-1815 industrialisation (&quot;Starvecrow Farm&quot;) or the 1825 financial crisis (&quot;Ovington&#x27;s Bank&quot;, reprinted in 2012 and 2015 on the back of a similar crisis in 2008).

Weyman called his books &quot;pleasant fables&quot; and was aware of their modest literary value.

<text>Guisin (?–427, r. 420–427) was the nineteenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of King Jeonji and Lady Palsu.

The traditional dates of Guisin&#x27;s rule are based on the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, however, only the date of enthronement and his death is recorded.

Based on more contemporaneous Chinese records, the historian J. W. Best has suggested that the years 414–429 or 430 are more plausible.

==Different accounts regarding the reign of the king==
By the records of &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he reigned from 420 to 427 AD for eight years, which can be calculated from the record. However, the Book of Song does not mention Guisin as the king and goes straight from Jeonji (written as 餘映.Read as yeoyeong) to Biyu (written as 餘毗.Read as Yeobi) Nihon Shoki accounts that since Guisin was young that a figure called Mokumanchi (木満致), son of Mokurakonshi (木羅斤資), ruled for him and quotes from a record of Baekje that is now lost.

==Family==
* Father: Jeonji of Baekje
* Mother: Lady Palsu (八須夫人, 생몰년 미상) – from the Jin clan.
** Queen: unknown
*** Buyeo Bi (扶餘毗, ?–455) – 20th King of Baekje, Biyu of Baekje.

<doc id="1166642" wikidata="Q973227" url="?curid=1166642" title="Fletching">
<text>Fletching is the fin-shaped aerodynamic stabilization device attached on arrows, bolts, darts, or javelins, and are typically made from light semi-flexible materials such as feathers or bark. Each piece of such fin is a fletch, also known as a flight or feather. A fletcher is a person who attaches fletchings to the shaft of arrows. Fletchers were traditionally associated with the Worshipful Company of Fletchers, a guild in the City of London.

The word is related to the French word , meaning &#x27;arrow&#x27;, via the ultimate root of Old Frankish .

== Description ==
As a noun, &quot;fletching&quot; refers collectively to the fins or vanes, each of which individually is known as a fletch. Traditionally, the fletching consists of three matched half-feathers attached near the back of the arrow or shaft of the dart that are equally spaced 120° degree intervals around its circumference. Four fletchings have also been used. 

In English archery, the male feather, from a cock, is used on the outside of the arrow, while the other two stabilizing feathers are from a female, or hen. Traditional archery lore about feather curvature is that a right handed archer should shoot a right winged feather and right handed helical, and a left handed archer should use the opposite. Slow motion cameras show the arrow does not begin to spin until it is well past the riser (centre section of the bow), and the most important point is to have consistency in fletching. Shooting a feathered arrow with a bow with a riser shelf, instead of a plastic vane, is wiser since the feathers will compress and flatten while coming off the bow.

On compound bows, feathers may be a hindrance, and plastic vanes are a better solution. At the high speeds coming off a compound bow, plastic vanes with no curvature still allow the arrow to fly straight without tumbling. Also, noise is increased with feathers on these higher-powered bows, which can be a problem for hunters.

Today, modern plastics may be used instead. Fletches were traditionally attached with glue and silk thread, but with modern glue/thread/tape this is no longer necessary, unless the arrow is a reproduction of a historical arrow. The fletching is used to stabilize the arrow aerodynamically. Feather fletches impart a natural spin on an arrow due to the rough and smooth sides of a feather and the natural curve, determined by which wing the feather came from. Vanes need to be placed at a slight angle (called an offset fletch), or set into a twist (called a helical fletch) to create the same effect, but all are there to impart stability to the projectile to ensure that the projectile does not tumble during flight. 

More generally, &quot;fletching&quot; can refer to any structures added to a projectile to aerodynamically stabilize its flight, many of which resemble arrows in form and function. For instance, the feathers at the butt end of a dart (of the type cast using an atlatl) are very similar in purpose and construction to those used in arrows. Most of the techniques of fletching were likely adapted from earlier dart-making techniques. The fins used to stabilize rockets work in a similar manner.

<doc id="1166646" wikidata="Q1424011" url="?curid=1166646" title="Storage heater">
<text>A storage heater or heat bank (Australia) is an electrical heater which stores thermal energy during the evening, or at night when electricity is available at lower cost, and releases the heat during the day as required. Alternatively, solar storage heaters are designed to store solar energy as heat, to be released during the night or other periods where it is required, often making it more cost effective than selling surplus electricity to the grid and buying it back at night.

==Principle of operation==
Storage heaters are typically composed of clay bricks or other ceramic material (grog), of concrete walls, or of water containers. There are also special materials such as feolite. This material serves as a heat storage medium. There are electrical heating elements embedded in the material which can be switched on to heat the storage medium and thus to store energy.

The stored heat is given off continuously (through thermal radiation and convection). To speed up the heat transfer, storage heaters may come equipped with mechanical fans that can move air through the heater; see the section on fan-assisted storage heaters.

== Types of storage heater ==

=== High heat retention storage heaters ===
High heat retention storage heaters (HHRSH) are the newest and most advanced storage heaters on the market. High heat retention storage heaters are able to retain more heat than traditional storage heaters, with a minimum of 45% heat retention 24 hours after a full charge. This significantly reduces the heat wasted during the day, and is achieved through improved insulation. High heat retention storage heaters also include smart controls and monitor climatic conditions to estimate future heat demand, making them much more responsive to changes in their environment than traditional storage heaters. All high heat retention storage heaters are also Lot 20 compliant, in line with the EcoDesign regulations which came into force on 1 January 2018.

== Regulations ==
Lot 20 is an EU legislation that was designed to remove inefficient heating technologies from the market and reduce the energy used by products that heat our homes. The goal of the legislation is to achieve the UK&#x27;s overall carbon reduction targets and has been in place since 1 January 2018. It states that all installed electric heating products manufactured from 1 January 2018 must have an electronic thermostat with a 24-hour, 7-day timer with either adaptive start or an open window sensor. Storage heaters must include: an electronic heat charge control with room and/or outdoor temperature feedback or controlled by energy supplier, an electronic room temperature control plus week timer and a fan assisted output. Optional additional compliance features are distance control, adaptive start and open window detection. Non-compliant stock that was manufactured before this date may still be sold.

From an environmental health point of view, asbestos has been used in night storage heaters for many years, the fibers of which can get into the air and pose considerable negative health impact.

== Application ==
Storage heaters are usually used in conjunction with a two-tariff electricity meter which records separately the electricity used during the off-peak period so that it can be billed at a lower rate. In order to enjoy the lower rates, the house must be on a special electricity tariff. In most countries, storage heaters are only economical (compared to other forms of heating) when used with such a special tariff. In the United Kingdom the Economy 7 tariff is appropriate.

Storage heaters usually have two controls: a charge control (often called &quot;input&quot;), which controls the amount of heat stored, and the draught control (often called &quot;output&quot;), which controls the rate at which heat is released. These controls may be controlled by the user, or may operate automatically once the user selects the target room temperature on a thermostat.

Storage heaters may also incorporate an electric heater (utilizing either resistance heaters or heat pumps), which can be used to increase heat output. Such added heating, if it is resistance heating, is expensive, as it occurs during the high-tariff time of day.

==Comparison to other heating systems==

===Advantages===
*Storage heaters, while often still more expensive than equivalent gas- or oil-fired heating systems, are cheaper than running the same amount of electrical heating using electricity at regular daytime rates.
*Users of gas central heating and some other systems often turn off the heating during the night as an economy measure, with the result that the house is cold at night and early morning; but because night storage heaters are on at night, the house is still warm at those times.
*Using storage heaters allows houses to be sited in areas where natural-gas distribution systems are not available, without requiring the homeowners to pay higher daytime electrical-heating bills.
*The capital cost of night storage heating is relatively low, and installation is far easier than the initial installation of gas-fired boilers, piping and radiators, or electric heat pumps. This is an important advantage when renovating old buildings without existing central heating.
*As compared to gas central heating systems, night storage heaters have next to no maintenance costs.

===Disadvantages===
*Heat is lost from the heater while charging overnight. The room is warm in the morning, but this is because it has wastefully been heated all night.
*The heat stored during the night will be released into the living area during the next day, regardless of need (due to the inevitable heat transfer through the storage heater&#x27;s insulation). Thus if the homeowner is unexpectedly absent that day (and therefore does not need the house to be warmed) or is only at home for a small part of the day, the heat has already been purchased and is already there, and eventually comes out.
*The storage heater can only heat with the energy stored the night before. Thus if the system was switched off or if the charge control was set too low, there may not be sufficient energy to heat the rooms, and this can only be corrected for the next day. This is a problem for example when the weather turns cold unexpectedly, or when returning from a vacation late at night, or users simply not thinking to change the settings because they are at a comfortable temperature. Some heaters alleviate this problem by also allowing heating during the day, but this is typically expensive (because the electricity is charged at full rate). Even under the best of circumstances it can be difficult to accurately judge how to set the thermostats as setting them too low overnight can cause the heater to be having no perceived effect while setting them at maximum will increase the cost of running them. Similarly in systems where every heater must be set individually, incorrectly setting one room&#x27;s heater can make the whole house feel too cold.
*Many users may not fully understand the controls. A common error is leaving the output (or boost) control open at night, so that the heaters dissipate heat when they should be storing it, with a consequent increase in electricity consumption and cost. Alternatively they may set the input control to minimum at night instead of the output, which can mean there is no heat at all for the next day.
*Sizing a storage heater is a compromise between the maximum expected cold-spell intensity and duration, and the cost and space requirement of the heater. If the heater is too large, its cost will be excessive and it will impact on the building&#x27;s available area; if too small, the cost of supplemental (daytime) electrical heating will be excessive.
* Storage heaters are very heavy and somewhat bulky, due to the material used to store heat. They typically take up more floor space than the radiators used in most other heating systems.
* In most countries, electricity costs 2-3 times as much as gas or oil per unit of heat (joule or kWh), and the reduced off-peak tariffs and higher delivery efficiency do not fully overcome this difference.
*When the fan (if included) is used to speed up heat transfer, the air circulation will increase the amount of airborne dust in the heated room. This can be a problem for people with allergies. Therefore, central heating is a better source of heat for allergy sufferers. This can be avoided by not using the fan, but then it is more difficult to regulate the heat transfer, which occurs by radiation and natural convection as with normal central heating radiators.

== Using storage heaters ==
Storage heaters can be cost-effective if used properly, but control may be trickier than fuel-fired systems.

=== Power switches ===

Storage heaters generally require two power circuits, one for on-peak and one for off-peak electricity, and two power switches, which are switched off during the summer when heat is not required. During other months the off-peak switch can be left on at all times, with the on-peak switch being used when insufficient energy has been stored during off-peak times. The amount of heat that is stored can be altered using the controls on the storage heater unit.
Normally the on-peak will have a fuse as it is part of another circuit. The off-peak will just be a switch as it has a dedicated circuit.
Some installations work on off-peak electricity only and cannot be switched on during the day.

=== Basic controls ===

Basic storage heaters have an input switch, and an output switch, called &quot;heat boost&quot; on some models.

The position of the input switch may be changed to reflect how cold the next day is predicted to be. The input switch is normally thermostatic, cutting off the charge when the room reaches a certain temperature overnight. The exact setting needed will depend on the size of the storage heater, the desired room temperature during the day, the number of hours that this needs to be maintained, and the room&#x27;s rate of heat loss under a given set of circumstances. Some experimenting may be needed to find the relationship between forecast outside temperature and best input setting for a particular room. Most storage heater users follow simpler guidelines; for example, in the middle of winter, it is often appropriate to turn the input switch to its maximum setting. There is no need to touch the input switch on a daily basis if the same sort of weather prevails for weeks at a time. There is no need to touch the input switch during the day, as storage heaters only use electricity at night.

The output switch may require attention throughout the day. Before going to bed, the operator should switch the output to its minimum setting. This keeps as much heat in the bricks as possible. Enough will leak out into the room to make it warm in the morning. Only in exceptionally cold circumstances will the operator require output overnight. The operator may wish to slowly increase the output switch during the day to try to maintain the temperature in the house. Increasing the output will allow the heat to convect out of the heater. If the house is empty during the day, the output should be left at a minimum all day and then switched up when returning to the house in order to let more heat escape.

Many storage heaters also have a mechanically-controlled automatic output switch. In this case, if the manual output switch is not set to minimum overnight, the damper will automatically close (as if the output switch had been set to minimum), and then the damper will re-open after a time delay; this time delay is measured by the gradual drop in the heater&#x27;s core temperature, and is therefore longer if the core temperature started higher due to more charge. The delay can also be biased by the output switch&#x27;s setting. Some output switches that are set up this way are marked &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; as well as &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;open&quot;; the minimum &quot;closed&quot; setting corresponds with &quot;early&quot; and the maximum &quot;open&quot; setting corresponds with &quot;late&quot;. These output switches can be controlled manually by ensuring they are closed at night and opened when desired, or they can be left to automatic operation by not closing at night.

=== Thermostatic controls ===

A thermostatic storage heater will automatically regulate the temperature in a room throughout the day. However, the operator may wish to switch the thermostatic switch to the minimum setting overnight to lower the room temperature. If the room is empty during the day, it is better to keep the thermostat at the minimum setting and then increase the setting when the room is occupied in the evening. Some thermostatic heaters also make use of on-peak electricity when there is not enough stored heat to maintain the requested temperature; the user may wish to be aware of this and lower the settings.

=== Fan-assisted storage heaters ===
Fan-assisted storage heaters employ an electric fan to drive air through the heater rather than relying on convection. The fan is usually controlled by a thermostat which allows the user to set the desired room temperature. The use of the fan means these heaters can be insulated more than other models, and therefore lose less heat due to heat transfer at times when heat is not required (such as when the room is not occupied, or at night).

==Environmental aspects==
In common with other forms of direct electric heating, storage heaters are not necessarily environmentally friendly because the source of electricity may be generated using fossil fuels, with up to two-thirds of energy in the fuel lost at the power station and in transmission losses. In Sweden the use of direct electric heating has been restricted since the 1980s for this reason, and there are plans to phase it out entirely—see Oil phase-out in Sweden—while Denmark and Germany have banned the installation of electric space heating in new buildings for similar reasons (though in Germany the ban was lifted in 2013).

In the UK, a storage heater earns a &quot;Poor&quot; rating for Environmental Performance on an Energy Performance Certificate. However many progressive countries are developing their electricity generating system, principally, to incorporate &quot;greener&quot;, more sustainable and renewable energy sources; so how &quot;green&quot; a storage heater system is would in principle depend on how the electricity used is generated. Of course this argument applies to all forms of electric heating, but the ability of a storage heater system to use electricity at times when, for example, wind generated electricity could not otherwise be used, may in conjunction with a smart grid give storage heating a new role in the future.

In some countries, the current design of the electrical generating system may result in a surplus of electricity from base load power stations during off-peak periods, and storage heaters may then be able to make use of this surplus to increase the net efficiency of the system as a whole. However, future changes in supply and demand—for example as a result of energy conservation measures or a more responsive generating system—may then reverse this situation, with storage heaters preventing a reduction in the national base load. Other technologies may incorporate demand response electronics to sense when there is a change in supply and demand. Thereby, they ensure that these loads only use off-peak electricity. Further advances in supply technology could provide for a more bespoke &#x27;supply and demand&#x27; tariff system to make smart grid sensing technologies like dynamic demand a more viable financial prospect.

Compared to other forms of electric heating, storage heaters are cheaper to run and they impose lower peak loads. The highest peak loads come from instantaneous electric heating, such as immersion water heaters, which create heavy loads for short durations, although instantaneous water heaters may use less electricity overall. High-efficiency ground source heat pumps are able to use up to 66% less electricity than storage heaters in heating by recovering heat from the ground, and are regarded as preferable even though they use electricity throughout the day. Air source heat pumps give similar efficiency increases and are generally easier and cheaper to install for domestic use. These are not to be confused with air conditioning (A/C) heat pumps which provide cooling with an increased carbon footprint and are now considered to be an environmental liability in some, (in particular hotter climate), countries.

Where alternatives to electricity exist, hot-water central heating systems can use water heated in or close to the building using high-efficiency condensing boilers, biofuels, heat pumps or district heating. Ideally hot water heating should be used. This can be converted in the future to use other technologies such as solar panels, so also providing future-proofing. In the case of new buildings, low-energy buildings such as those built to the Passive House standard can eliminate almost all the need for conventional space heating systems.

<doc id="1166647" wikidata="Q287506" url="?curid=1166647" title="Magnetic reconnection">
<text>Magnetic reconnection is a physical process occurring in electrically conducting plasmas, in which the magnetic topology is rearranged and magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy, thermal energy, and particle acceleration. Magnetic reconnection involves plasma flows at a substantial fraction of the Alfvén wave speed, which is the fundamental speed for mechanical information flow in a magnetized plasma.

The concept of magnetic reconnection was developed in parallel by researchers working in solar physics and in the interaction between the solar wind and magnetized planets. This reflects the bidirectional nature of reconnection, which can either disconnect formerly connected magnetic fields or connect formerly disconnected magnetic fields, depending on the circumstances.

Ron Giovanelli is credited with the first publication invoking magnetic energy release as a potential mechanism for particle acceleration in solar flares. Giovanelli proposed in 1946 that solar flares stem from the energy obtained by charged particles influenced by induced electric fields within close proximity of sunspots. In the years 1947-1948, he published more papers further developing the reconnection model of solar flares. In these works, he proposed that the mechanism occurs at points of neutrality (weak or null magnetic field) within structured magnetic fields.

James Dungey is credited with first use of the term “magnetic reconnection” in his 1950 PhD thesis, to explain the coupling of mass, energy and momentum from the solar wind into Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. The concept was published for the first time in a seminal paper in 1961. Dungey coined the term &quot;reconnection&quot; because he envisaged field lines and plasma moving together in an inflow toward a magnetic neutral point (2D) or line (3D), breaking apart and then rejoining again but with different magnetic field lines and plasma, in an outflow away from the magnetic neutral point or line. 

In the meantime, the first theoretical framework of magnetic reconnection was established by Peter Sweet and Eugene Parker at a conference in 1956. Sweet pointed out that by pushing two plasmas with oppositely directed magnetic fields together, resistive diffusion is able to occur on a length scale much shorter than a typical equilibrium length scale. Parker was in attendance at this conference and developed scaling relations for this model during his return travel.

== Fundamental principles ==

Magnetic reconnection is a breakdown of &quot;ideal-magnetohydrodynamics&quot; and so of &quot;Alfvén&#x27;s theorem&quot; (also called the &quot;frozen-in flux theorem&quot;) which applies to large-scale regions of a highly-conducting magnetoplasma, for which the Magnetic Reynolds Number is very large: this makes the convective term in the induction equation dominate in such regions. The frozen-in flux theorem states that in such regions the field moves with the plasma velocity (the mean of the ion and electron velocities, weighted by their mass). The reconnection breakdown of this theorem occurs in regions of large magnetic shear (by Ampére&#x27;s law these are current sheets) which are regions of small width where the Magnetic Reynolds Number can become small enough to make the diffusion term in the induction equation dominate, meaning that the field diffuses through the plasma from regions of high field to regions of low field. In reconnection, the inflow and outflow regions both obey Alfvén&#x27;s theorem and the diffusion region is a very small region at the centre of the current sheet where field lines diffuse together, merge and reconfigure such that they are transferred from the topology of the inflow regions (i.e., along the current sheet) to that of the outflow regions (i.e., threading the current sheet). The rate of this magnetic flux transfer is the electric field associated with both the inflow and the outflow and is called the &quot;reconnection rate&quot;. 

The equivalence of magnetic shear and current can be seen from one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations

formula_1

In a plasma (ionized gas), for all but exceptionally high frequency phenomena, the second term on the right-hand side of this equation, the displacement current, is negligible compared to the effect of the free current formula_2 and this equation reduces to Ampére&#x27;s law for free charges. The displacement current is neglected in both the Parker-Sweet and Petschek theoretical treatments of reconnection, discussed below, and in the derivation of ideal MHD and Alfvén&#x27;s theorem which is applied in those theories everywhere outside the small diffusion region. 

The resistivity of the current layer allows magnetic flux from either side to diffuse through the current layer, cancelling outflux from the other side of the boundary. However, the small spatial scale of the current sheet makes the Magnetic Reynolds Number small and so this alone can make the diffusion term dominate in the induction equation without the resistivity being enhanced. When the diffusing field lines from the two sites of the boundary touch they form the separatrices and so have both the topology of the inflow region (i.e. along the current sheet) and the outflow region (i.e., threading the current sheet). In magnetic reconnection the field lines evolve from the inflow topology through the separatrices topology to the outflow topology. When this happens, the plasma is pulled out by Magnetic tension force acting on the reconfigured field lines and ejecting them along the current sheet. The resulting drop in pressure pulls more plasma and magnetic flux into the central region, yielding a self-sustaining process. The importance of Dungey&#x27;s concept of a localized breakdown of ideal-MHD is that the outflow along the current sheet prevents the build-up in plasma pressure that would otherwise choke off the inflow. In Parker-Sweet reconnection the outflow is only along a thin layer the centre of the current sheet and this limits the reconnection rate that can be achieved to low values. On the other hand, in Petschek reconnection the outflow region is much broader, being between shock fronts (now thought to be Alfvén waves) that stand in the inflow: this allows much faster escape of the plasma frozen-in on reconnected field lines and the reconnection rate can be much higher.

Dungey coined the term &quot;reconnection&quot; because he initially envisaged field lines of the inflow topology breaking and then joining together again in the outflow topology. However, this means that magnetic monopoles would exist, albeit for a very limited period, which would violate Maxwell&#x27;s equation that the divergence of the field is zero. However, by considering the evolution through the separatrix topology, the need to invoke magnetic monopoles is avoided. Global numerical MHD models of the magnetosphere, which use the equations of ideal MHD, still simulate magnetic reconnection even though it is a breakdown of ideal MHD. The reason is close to Dungey&#x27;s original thoughts: at each time step of the numerical model the equations of ideal MHD are solved at each grid point of the simulation to evaluate the new field and plasma conditions. The magnetic field lines then have to be re-traced. The tracing algorithm makes errors at thin current sheets and joins field lines up by threading the current sheet where they were previously aligned with the current sheet. This is often called &quot;numerical resistivity&quot; and the simulations have predictive value because the error propagates according to a diffusion equation.

A current problem in plasma physics is that observed reconnection happens much faster than predicted by MHD in high Lundquist number plasmas (i.e. fast magnetic reconnection). Solar flares, for example, proceed 13–14 orders of magnitude faster than a naive calculation would suggest, and several orders of magnitude faster than current theoretical models that include turbulence and kinetic effects. One possible mechanism to explain the discrepancy is that the electromagnetic turbulence in the boundary layer is sufficiently strong to scatter electrons, raising the plasma&#x27;s local resistivity. This would allow the magnetic flux to diffuse faster.

== Properties ==
=== Physical interpretation ===
The qualitative description of the reconnection process is such that magnetic field lines from different magnetic domains (defined by the field line connectivity) are spliced to one another, changing their patterns of connectivity with respect to the sources. It is a violation of an approximate conservation law in plasma physics, called Alfvén&#x27;s theorem (also called the &quot;frozen-in flux theorem&quot;) and can concentrate mechanical or magnetic energy in both space and time. Solar flares, the largest explosions in the Solar System, may involve the reconnection of large systems of magnetic flux on the Sun, releasing, in minutes, energy that has been stored in the magnetic field over a period of hours to days. Magnetic reconnection in Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere is one of the mechanisms responsible for the aurora, and it is important to the science of controlled nuclear fusion because it is one mechanism preventing magnetic confinement of the fusion fuel.

In an electrically conductive plasma, magnetic field lines are grouped into &#x27;domains&#x27;— bundles of field lines that connect from a particular place to another particular place, and that are topologically distinct from other field lines nearby. This topology is approximately preserved even when the magnetic field itself is strongly distorted by the presence of variable currents or motion of magnetic sources, because effects that might otherwise change the magnetic topology instead induce eddy currents in the plasma; the eddy currents have the effect of canceling out the topological change.

=== Types of reconnection ===
In two dimensions, the most common type of magnetic reconnection is separator reconnection, in which four separate magnetic domains exchange magnetic field lines. Domains in a magnetic plasma are separated by &quot;separatrix surfaces&quot;: curved surfaces in space that divide different bundles of flux. Field lines on one side of the separatrix all terminate at a particular magnetic pole, while field lines on the other side all terminate at a different pole of similar sign. Since each field line generally begins at a north magnetic pole and ends at a south magnetic pole, the most general way of dividing simple flux systems involves four domains separated by two separatrices: one separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a south pole, and the other separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a north pole. The intersection of the separatrices forms a &quot;separator&quot;, a single line that is at the boundary of the four separate domains. In separator reconnection, field lines enter the separator from two of the domains, and are spliced one to the other, exiting the separator in the other two domains (see the first figure).

In three dimensions, the geometry of the field lines become more complicated than the two-dimensional case and it is possible for reconnection to occur in regions where a separator does not exist, but with the field lines connected by steep gradients. These regions are known as quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), and have been observed in theoretical configurations and solar flares.

==Theoretical descriptions==

===Slow reconnection: Sweet–Parker model===
The first theoretical framework of magnetic reconnection was established by Peter Sweet and Eugene Parker at a conference in 1956. Sweet pointed out that by pushing two plasmas with oppositely directed magnetic fields together, resistive diffusion is able to occur on a length scale much shorter than a typical equilibrium length scale. Parker was in attendance at this conference and developed scaling relations for this model during his return travel.

The Sweet–Parker model describes time-independent magnetic reconnection in the resistive MHD framework when the reconnecting magnetic fields are antiparallel (oppositely directed) and effects related to viscosity and compressibility are unimportant. The initial velocity is simply an formula_3 velocity, so
formula_4

where formula_5 is the out-of-plane electric field, formula_6 is the characteristic inflow velocity, and formula_7 is the characteristic upstream magnetic field strength. By neglecting displacement current, the low-frequency Ampere&#x27;s law, formula_8, gives the relation
formula_9

where formula_10 is the current sheet half-thickness. This relation uses that the magnetic field reverses over a distance of formula_11. By matching the ideal electric field outside of the layer with the resistive electric field formula_12 inside the layer (using Ohm&#x27;s law), we find that
formula_13

where formula_14 is the magnetic diffusivity. When the inflow density is comparable to the outflow density, conservation of mass yields the relationship
formula_15

where formula_16 is the half-length of the current sheet and formula_17 is the outflow velocity. The left and right hand sides of the above relation represent the mass flux into the layer and out of the layer, respectively. Equating the upstream magnetic pressure with the downstream dynamic pressure gives
formula_18

where formula_19 is the mass density of the plasma. Solving for the outflow velocity then gives
formula_20

where formula_21 is the Alfvén velocity. With the above relations, the dimensionless reconnection rate formula_22 can then be written in two forms, the first in terms of formula_23 using the result earlier derived from Ohm&#x27;s law, the second in terms of formula_24 from the conservation of mass as
formula_25

Since the dimensionless Lundquist number formula_26 is given by
formula_27

the two different expressions of formula_22 are multiplied by each other and then square-rooted, giving a simple relation between the reconnection rate formula_22 and the Lundquist number formula_26
formula_31

Sweet–Parker reconnection allows for reconnection rates much faster than global diffusion, but is not able to explain the fast reconnection rates observed in solar flares, the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, and laboratory plasmas. Additionally, Sweet–Parker reconnection neglects three-dimensional effects, collisionless physics, time-dependent effects, viscosity, compressibility, and downstream pressure. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional magnetic reconnection typically show agreement with this model. Results from the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) of collisional reconnection show agreement with a generalized Sweet–Parker model which incorporates compressibility, downstream pressure and anomalous resistivity.

===Fast reconnection: Petschek model===

The fundamental reason that Petschek reconnection is faster than Parker-Sweet is that it broadens the outflow region and thereby removes some of the limitation caused by the build up in plasma pressure. The inflow velocity, and thus the reconnection rate, can only be very small if the outflow region is narrow. In 1964, Harry Petschek proposed a mechanism where the inflow and outflow regions are separated by stationary slow mode shocks that stand in the inflows. The aspect ratio of the diffusion region is then of order unity and the maximum reconnection rate becomes
formula_32

This expression allows for fast reconnection and is almost independent of the Lundquist number. Theory and numerical simulations show that most of the actions of the shocks that were proposed by Petschek can be carried out by Alfvén waves and in particular rotational discontinuities (RDs). In cases of asymmetric plasma densities on the two sides of the current sheet (as at Earth&#x27;s dayside magnetopause) the Alfvén wave that propagates into the inflow on higher-density side (in the case of the magnetopause the denser magnetosheath) has a lower propagation speed and so the field rotation increasingly becomes at that RD as the field line propagates away from the reconnection site: hence the magnetopause current sheet becomes increasingly concentrated in the outer, slower, RD. 

Simulations of resistive MHD reconnection with uniform resistivity showed the development of elongated current sheets in agreement with the Sweet–Parker model rather than the Petschek model. When a localized anomalously large resistivity is used, however, Petschek reconnection can be realized in resistive MHD simulations. Because the use of an anomalous resistivity is only appropriate when the particle mean free path is large compared to the reconnection layer, it is likely that other collisionless effects become important before Petschek reconnection can be realized.

===Anomalous resistivity and Bohm diffusion===
In the Sweet–Parker model, the common assumption is that the magnetic diffusivity is constant. This can be estimated using the equation of motion for an electron with mass formula_33 and electric charge formula_34:

formula_35

where formula_36 is the collision frequency. Since in the steady state, formula_37, then the above equation along with the definition of electric current, formula_38, where formula_39 is the electron number density, yields

formula_40

Nevertheless, if the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the thermal velocity of plasma, a steady state cannot be achieved and magnetic diffusivity should be much larger than what is given in the above. This is called anomalous resistivity, formula_41, which can enhance the reconnection rate in the Sweet–Parker model by a factor of formula_42.

Another proposed mechanism is known as the Bohm diffusion across the magnetic field. This replaces the Ohmic resistivity with formula_43, however, its effect, similar to the anomalous resistivity, is still too small compared with the observations.

===Stochastic reconnection===

In stochastic reconnection, magnetic field has a small scale random component arising because of turbulence. For the turbulent flow in the reconnection region, a model for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence should be used such as the model developed by Goldreich and Sridhar in 1995. This stochastic model is independent of small scale physics such as resistive effects and depends only on turbulent effects. Roughly speaking, in stochastic model, turbulence brings initially distant magnetic field lines to small separations where they can reconnect locally (Sweet-Parker type reconnection) and separate again due to turbulent super-linear diffusion (Richardson diffusion ). For a current sheet of the length formula_44, the upper limit for reconnection velocity is given by

formula_45

where formula_46. Here formula_47, and formula_48 are turbulence injection length scale and velocity respectively and formula_49 is the Alfvén velocity. This model has been successfully tested by numerical simulations.

===Non-MHD process: Collisionless reconnection===

On length scales shorter than the ion inertial length formula_50 (where formula_51 is the ion plasma frequency), ions decouple from electrons and the magnetic field becomes frozen into the electron fluid rather than the bulk plasma. On these scales, the Hall effect becomes important. Two-fluid simulations show the formation of an X-point geometry rather than the double Y-point geometry characteristic of resistive reconnection. The electrons are then accelerated to very high speeds by Whistler waves. Because the ions can move through a wider &quot;bottleneck&quot; near the current layer and because the electrons are moving much faster in Hall MHD than in standard MHD, reconnection may proceed more quickly. Two-fluid/collisionless reconnection is particularly important in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere.

== Observations ==

===Solar atmosphere===

Magnetic reconnection occurs during solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and many other events in the solar atmosphere. The observational evidence for solar flares includes observations of inflows/outflows, downflowing loops, and changes in the magnetic topology. In the past, observations of the solar atmosphere were done using remote imaging; consequently, the magnetic fields were inferred or extrapolated rather than observed directly. However, the first direct observations of solar magnetic reconnection were gathered in 2012 (and released in 2013) by the High Resolution Coronal Imager.

===Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere===

Magnetic reconnection events that occur in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere (in the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail) were for many years inferred because they uniquely explained many aspects of the large-scale behaviour of the magnetosphere and its dependence on the orientation of the near-Earth Interplanetary magnetic field. Subsequently, spacecraft such as Cluster II and the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission. have made observations of sufficient resolution and in multiple locations to observe the process directly and in-situ. Cluster II is a four-spacecraft mission, with the four spacecraft arranged in a tetrahedron to separate the spatial and temporal changes as the suite flies through space. It has observed numerous reconnection events in which the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field reconnects with that of the Sun (i.e. the Interplanetary Magnetic Field). These include &#x27;reverse reconnection&#x27; that causes sunward convection in the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere near the polar cusps; &#x27;dayside reconnection&#x27;, which allows the transmission of particles and energy into the Earth&#x27;s vicinity and &#x27;tail reconnection&#x27;, which causes auroral substorms by injecting particles deep into the magnetosphere and releasing the energy stored in the Earth&#x27;s magnetotail. The Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, launched on 13 March 2015, improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the Cluster II results by having a tighter constellation of spacecraft. This led to a better understanding of the behavior of the electrical currents in the electron diffusion region.

On 26 February 2008, THEMIS probes were able to determine the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms. Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification. Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, &quot;Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger.&quot;.

===Laboratory plasma experiments===

Magnetic reconnection has also been observed in numerous laboratory experiments. For example, studies on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA have observed and mapped quasi-separatrix layers near the magnetic reconnection region of a two flux rope system, while experiments on the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have confirmed many aspects of magnetic reconnection, including the Sweet–Parker model in regimes where the model is applicable. Analysis of the physics of helicity injection, used to create the initial plasma current in the NSTX spherical tokamak, led Dr. Fatima Ebrahimi to propose a plasma thruster that uses fast magnetic reconnection to accelerate plasma to produce thrust for space propulsion.

Sawtooth oscillations are periodic mixing events occurring in the tokamak plasma core. The Kadomtsev model describes sawtooth oscillations as a consequence of magnetic reconnection due to displacement of the central region with safety factor formula_52 caused by the internal kink mode.

<text>Ablain-Saint-Nazaire () is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France.

==Geography==
A farming village located 8 miles (12 km) north of Arras, on the D57 road. It was rebuilt after being destroyed during World War I. The Saint-Nazaire stream, which passes through the commune, is a small tributary of the river Deûle.

==Population==

==History==

At the start of World War I, the Battle of Lorette lasted for 12 months, from October 1914 to October 1915, resulting in high casualties on both sides: 100,000 killed and as many wounded.
A French national cemetery was built on 13 hectares nearby and comprises 20,000 graves, laid out irrespective of rank or military training. General Barbot has a private soldier buried next to him, on his right.
In eight ossuaries, around the base of the lantern tower, are the remains of 22,970 unidentified soldiers. A portion of the cemetery has been reserved for Muslim soldiers.

In 2014, to mark the centenary of the start of World War I, French President François Hollande and German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen inaugurated a memorial for Armistice Day.

<doc id="1166665" wikidata="Q3426207" url="?curid=1166665" title="Work ethic">
<text>Work ethic is a belief that work and diligence have a moral benefit and an inherent ability, virtue or value to strengthen character and individual abilities. Desire or determination to work serves as the foundation for values centered on the importance of work or industrious work. Social ingrainment of this value is considered to enhance character through hard work that is respective to an individual&#x27;s field of work. 

In ancient Greece, work was seen as a burden, and their term for it, &quot;ponos&quot;, shared its root with the Latin word &quot;poena&quot;, signifying sorrow. In Hebrew, work was associated with toil, representing the laborious act of extracting sustenance from the challenging earth. It was viewed as a consequence of the original sin in the Adam and Eve narrative. The Bible in reflects this, stating that due to their transgression, &quot;By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground.&quot;

==Factors of a good work ethic==
Proponents of a strong work ethic consider it to be important for achieving goals, that it gives strength to their orientation and the right mindset. A work ethic is a set of moral principles a person uses in their job. People who possess a strong work ethic embody certain principles that guide their work behaviour; according to proponents, a strong work ethic will result in the production of high-quality work which is consistent. The output motivates them to stay on track. A good work ethic fuels an individual&#x27;s needs and goals, it is related to the initiative by a person for the objectives. It is considered by fans as a source of self respect, satisfaction, and fulfillment.

Factors are:
#Goal-oriented actions: It is not about making plans or the next logical steps; it is about getting things done so that the work invested would not be counter-productive.
#Prioritized focus: Focusing on qualitative activities that a person is responsible for and in areas where they can make a difference or a high impact based on objectives.
#Being available and reliable: Spending time on the work and building oneself up for the task.
#Conscientiousness: A desire to do a task well, being vigilant and organized.
#Creating a rewarding routine/system: Engaging in tasks that provide strength and energy which can be transferred to your ultimate goals, creating a habit and a habitat for success.
#Embracing positivity: Shape a problem with the statement &quot;good, (action) (problem)&quot;, e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m tired and it is time for a workout&quot; leads to &quot;Good. Workout tired&quot;.

Work ethic also has been measured as a multidimensional variable composed of seven factors, including self-reliance, ethical behavior, valuing leisure time, hard work, giving importance/centrality of work, productive use of time, and delay of gratification.

A negative work ethic is a behavior of a single individual or a group that has led to a systematic lack of productivity, reliability, accountability and a growing sphere of unprofessional/unhealthy relationships (e.g., power politics, lack of social skills, etc.).

===Assumptions===
Assumptions about good work ethic, drawn out in the philosophical writings of Goldman, are:

#The path to what you want is to take action.
#The success of action plans depends upon how congruent one&#x27;s worldview () is with the society&#x27;s.
#Many problems faced are only a temporary breakdown of self management.
#Setting time limits for achieving goals helps to overcome the edge of discomforts that time can have on subjective needs.
#A positive problem-solving or goal attainment experience improves one&#x27;s ability to cope with the next difficulty.
#Hardships in life are a normality; they become a problem when they are the same over and over.
#A person is what they do, and feelings flow from behavior.
#Feelings can be viewed as beliefs about one&#x27;s wants.
#How hard you work will determine how far you go.

==Capitalist view==

The Puritans who settled in New England around the 17th and 18th centuries believed that working hard at one&#x27;s call was a sign that one would be saved. They were followed by Calvinists who believed in predestination and had faith that they were chosen or had the call from God to fulfill their duty in the world. To both of them, accumulation of wealth was an indicator of working to their fullest capacity as a response to the call and assurance for receiving salvation. These ideologies are the foundations of the Protestant work ethic.

Max Weber quotes the ethical writings of Benjamin Franklin:
Remember, that time is money. He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon &quot;that&quot; the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.

Remember, that money is the prolific, generating nature. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding sow, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.
Franklin believes that valuing time and money is linked to seeing hard work and thriftiness as crucial qualities. He thinks that money, when used wisely, can multiply and create more wealth. This idea mirrors the Protestant ethic&#x27;s focus on productive labor and reinvesting profits for progress. Franklin also states that reading the Bible showed him the importance of virtue. This also reflects the Christian search for understanding the ethic of living and the struggle to make a living.

Max Weber&#x27;s definition of work ethic was that a man should work well in his gainful occupation, not merely because he had to but because he wanted to; it was a sign of his virtue and a source of personal satisfaction.

The notion of work ethic continued to grow in the work values of the Western world. In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt expressed, &quot;Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.&quot;

Richard Thurnwald, in his work &quot;Economies in Primitive Communities,&quot; emphasized that people engage in work actively because humans have a natural inclination towards staying active and doing things.

In the 1940s, work ethic was considered very important and nonconformist ideals were dealt autocratically. It is recorded that, at the Ford Company, a worker named John Gallo was dismissed for, &quot;...laughing with the other fellows, and slowing down the assembly line...&quot;.

Steven Malanga refers to &quot;what was once understood as the work ethic—not just hard work but also a set of accompanying virtues, whose crucial role in the development and sustaining of free markets too few now recall&quot;.

Experimental studies have shown that people with fair work ethic are able to tolerate tedious jobs with equitable monetary rewards and benefits, are highly critical, and have a tendency for workaholism and a negative relation with leisure activity concepts. They valued meritocracy and egalitarianism.

Even if the death of work were to happen due to technological advancement that eliminates the need for people to work, the desire to stay actively involved in some form of activity is not bound to any particular phasing out of its existence.

==Anti-capitalist view==

Countercultural groups and communities have challenged these values in recent decades.

The French Leftist philosopher André Gorz (1923–2007) wrote:

&quot;The work ethic has become obsolete. It is no longer true that producing more means working more, or that producing more will lead to a better way of life.
The connection between more and better has been broken; our needs for many products and services are already more than adequately met, and many of our as-yet-unsatisfied needs will be met not by producing more, but by producing differently, producing other things, or even producing less. This is especially true as regards our needs for air, water, space, silence, beauty, time and human contact.

Neither is it true any longer that the more each individual works, the better off everyone will be. In a post-industrial society, not everyone &quot;has&quot; to work hard in order to survive, though may be forced to anyway due to the economic system. The present crisis has stimulated technological change of an unprecedented scale and speed: &#x27;the micro-chip revolution&#x27;. The object and indeed the effect of this revolution has been to make rapidly increasing savings in labour, in the industrial, administrative and service sectors. Increasing production is secured in these sectors by decreasing amounts of labour. As a result, the social process of production no longer needs everyone to work in it on a full-time basis. The work ethic ceases to be viable in such a situation and workbased society is thrown into crisis.&quot;
Anti-capitalists believe that the concept of &quot;hard work&quot; is meant by capitalists to delude the working class into becoming loyal servants to the elite, and that working hard, in itself, is not automatically an honorable thing, but only a means to creating more wealth for the people at the top of the economic pyramid. In the Soviet Union, the regime portrayed work ethic as an ideal to strive for.

The recession is a contributing factor that holds back work ethic, because the generation that inherits economic decline lives in an economy that is not ready to receive them. Without work there to do, the ethic that is attached to it fails to generate distinctive value. The negative work ethic and power structures that do not value or credit work done or unethically attribute work done as a service or with higher moral ideals have dissolved the ethic presented in the society and turned the focus onto self-centered perks and individualism. Further, urbanization and an emphasis on large-scale businesses has led to eliminating avenues for learning vital concepts about work. Millennials in a research identified what made them unique was consumerist trends like technology use, music/pop culture, liberal/tolerant beliefs, clothes, and individualistic ones like greater intelligence than work, they were not able to distinguish the concept in the traditional understandings of work ethic.

<text>Cryotherapy, sometimes known as cold therapy, is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy. Cryotherapy can be used in many ways, including whole body exposure for therapeutic health benefits or may be used locally to treat a variety of tissue lesions. 

Cryotherapy is often used in an effort to prevent or relieve muscle pain, sprains and swelling after soft tissue damage or surgery. When a musculoskeletal injury occurs, the body sends signals to the inflammatory cells, macrophages, which release IGF-1. IGF-1 is a hormone-insulin-like growth factor which initiates the termination of damaged tissue. In some cases, this inflammatory response can be aggravated and cause increased swelling and edema, which can actually prolong the recovery process. For decades, it has been commonly used to accelerate recovery in athletes after exercise. Cryotherapy decreases the temperature of tissue surfaces to minimize hypoxic cell death, edema accumulation, and muscle spasms. Minimising each or all of these ultimately alleviates discomfort and inflammation. It can involve a range of treatments, from the application of ice packs or immersion in ice baths (generally known as cold therapy), to the use of cold chambers.

== Cryotherapy chamber ==

Electric cryotherapy chambers are fully enclosed, walk-in rooms designed to expose the human body to ultra low temperatures for 2-3 minutes resulting in various therapeutic and health benefits. 

The purpose of cryotherapy is to trigger the body’s natural response to the extreme cold. Upon entering the cryo chamber, the extreme cold temperatures elicit a fight or flight response, causing increased levels of dopamine and Norepinephrine resulting in the feeling of extreme focus and sense of euphoria. The process of thermoregulation occurs to protect vital organs from the cold temperatures, promoting increased blood flow and delivery of nutrients throughout the body via vasoconstriction and vasodilation of the blood vessels. 

Electric cryo chambers use refrigeration as a cooling agent providing a safe, breathable environment, not exposing the client to any dangerous gases such as nitrogen. 

Cryotherapy is a specific type of low-temperature treatment used to reduce inflammation and its associated pain.

Cryotherapy was developed in the 1970s by Japanese rheumatologist Toshima Yamaguchi and introduced to Europe, US and Australia in the 1980s and 1990s. 
== Mechanism of action ==
When the body is subjected to extreme cooling, the blood vessels are narrowed which reduces blood flow to the areas of swelling. Once outside the cryogenic chamber, the vessels expand, and an increased presence of anti-inflammatory proteins (IL-10) is established in the blood. The treatment typically involves exposing the individual to freezing, dry temperatures (at −40 °C) for 2 to 4 minutes in one of these chambers. While in the cryotherapy chamber, blood flow is reduced in that injured area. This will reduce muscle spasms and soreness. This is important to activate the circulatory system to encourage healing and regenerate muscle fibers.

== Main uses ==
Proponents say that cryotherapy may reduce pain and inflammation, help with mental disorders, support exercise recovery and improve joint function. Cryotherapy chambers belong to the group of equipment associated with sports rehabilitation and wellness.

== Cryosurgery ==
Cryosurgery is the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue. The application of ultra-cold liquid causes damage to the treated tissue due to intracellular ice formation. The degree of damage depends upon the minimum temperature achieved and the rate of cooling. Cryosurgery is used to treat a number of diseases and disorders, most especially skin conditions like warts, moles, skin tags and solar keratoses. Liquid nitrogen is usually used to freeze the tissues at the cellular level. The procedure is used often as it is relatively easy and quick, can be done in the doctor&#x27;s office, and is deemed quite low risk. If a cancerous lesion is suspected then excision rather than cryosurgery may be deemed more appropriate. Contraindications to the use of cryosurgery include but are not limited to; using it over a neoplasm, someone with conditions that are worsened by exposure to cold (i.e. Raynaud&#x27;s, urticaria), and poor circulation or no sensation in the area. There are some precautions to using cryosurgery. They include someone with collagen vascular disease, dark-skinned individuals (due to high risk of hypopigmentation), and impaired sensation at the area being treated.

== Ice pack therapy ==

Ice pack therapy is a treatment of cold temperatures to an injured area of the body. Though the therapy is extensively used, and it is agreed that it alleviates symptoms, testing has produced conflicting results about its efficacy and possibility of producing undesirable results.

An ice pack is placed over an injured area and is intended to absorb heat of a closed traumatic or Edematous injury by using conduction to transfer thermal energy. The physiologic effects of cold application include immediate vasoconstriction with reflexive vasodilation, decreased local metabolism and enzymatic activity, and decreased oxygen demand. Cold decreases muscle spindle fiber activity and slows nerve conduction velocity; therefore, it is often used to decrease spasticity and muscle guarding. It is commonly used to alleviate the pain of minor injuries, as well as decrease muscle soreness. The use of ice packs in treatment decreases the blood flow most rapidly at the beginning of the cooling period, this occurs as a result of vasoconstriction, the initial reflex sympathetic activity. Although the use of cryotherapy has been shown to aid in muscle recovery, some studies have highlighted that the degree of muscle cooling in humans is not significant enough to produce a considerable effect on muscle recovery. Based on previous research comparing human and animal models, the insufficient degree of cooling is due to larger limb size, more adipose tissue, and a higher muscle diameter in humans.

Ice is not commonly used prior to rehabilitation or performance because of its known adverse effects to performance such as decreased myotatic reflex and force production, as well as a decrease in balance immediately following ice pack therapy for 20 minutes. However, if ice pack therapy is applied for less than 10 minutes, performance can occur without detrimental effects. If the ice pack is removed at this time, athletes are sent back to training or competition directly with no decrease in performance. Ice has also been shown to possibly slow and impair muscle protein synthesis and repair in recreational athletes. This is especially true for cold water immersion, but equivalent controlled studies have not been done to see if the same effects hold true for ice packs. Regardless, ice has been shown in studies to inhibit the uptake of dietary protein post-muscle conditioning exercise.

Although there are many positive effects of cryotherapy in athletes&#x27; short-term recovery, in recent years, there has been much controversy regarding whether cryotherapy is actually beneficial or may be causing the opposite effect. While inflammation that occurs post-injury or from a damaging exercise may be detrimental to secondary tissue, it is beneficial for the structural and functional repair of the damaged tissue. Therefore, some researchers are now recommending that ice not be used so as not to delay the natural healing process following an injury. The original RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) method was rescinded because the inflammatory response is necessary for the healing process, and this practice may delay healing instead of facilitating it. Animal studies also show that a disrupted inflammatory stage of healing may lead to impaired tissue repair and redundant collagen synthesis.

There is a study that concludes that cryotherapy has a positive impact on the short-term recovery of athletes. Cryotherapy helped manage muscle soreness and facilitate recovery within the first 24 hours following a sport-related activity. Athletes who use cryotherapy within the first 24 hours to alleviate pain recovered at a faster rate than athletes who did not use cryotherapy after their sport-related activity.

== Cryotherapy following total knee replacement ==
Cryotherapy may be associated with reducing inflammation and pain reduction. However, the effectiveness of cryotherapy on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still unclear. A systemic review found that six out of eight randomized controlled trails indicate that there is no significant benefit of using cryotherapy. The result may depend on several factors such as application time per session, duration and frequency of application of cryotherapy

Post-surgical management following total knee replacement surgery may include cryotherapy with the goal of helping with pain management and blood loss following surgery. Cryotherapy is applied using ice, cold water, or gel packs, sometimes in specialized devices that surround the skin and surgical site (but keeps the surgical site clean). Evidence from clinical trials regarding the effectiveness of cryotherapy is weak and because of this, the use of cryotherapy may not be justified. Weak evidence indicates that cryotherapy used postoperatively may be associated with a small decrease in blood loss and pain following the surgery. No clinically significant improvements in range of motion have been reported. There are not many side effects or adverse effects reported with this intervention. Some studies suggest that cryotherapy may offer minor reductions in swelling and pain after total knee arthroplasty, but systematic reviews indicate that its overall effectiveness remains inconclusive. The application methods vary, with durations ranging from brief ice pack sessions to continuous cooling for up to 48 hours using automated devices.Further study is needed to assess any potential harms or adverse effects associated with cryotherapy after total knee arthroplasty.

== Traditional vs continuous cryotherapy after total knee arthroplasty ==
Cryotherapy, the withdrawal of heat from an individual&#x27;s body via the application of cold modalities to reduce tissue temperature, has been known as a treatment intervention for the overall management of musculoskeletal injuries, especially when it comes to relieving pain and improving functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. Over the years, new cryotherapy devices that aim to maintain a fixed temperature for a prolonged time have become more apparent, thereby questioning both the efficacy and therapeutic outcomes of continuous cryotherapy with the ones of traditional cryotherapy.

The most concurrent systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare continuous and traditional applications of cryotherapy on patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty, specifically in pain intensity, analgesics consumption, swelling, blood loss, postoperative range of motion (PROM), and length of hospital stay. According to the study&#x27;s findings, there were no statistically significant differences in pain intensity, analgesic consumption, swelling, blood loss, PROM, and length of hospital stay between the continuous and traditional cryotherapy groups. At the same time, the study acknowledges its limitations, including lack of blinding, substantial heterogeneity, and modest sample sizes in eligible trials.

In addition to such findings, the study compared the financial implications of both continuous cryotherapy and traditional cryotherapy. They found that continuous cryotherapy may be subject to additional costs not covered by insurance. In contrast, the cost of traditional cryotherapy is nearly negligible. 

With that in mind, continuous cryotherapy was shown to have produced similar clinical effects to traditional cryotherapy; the only difference being the additional costs that insurance companies do not cover with continuous cryotherapy. Therefore, the researchers state the current evidence isn’t substantial enough to support the theoretical cost-effectiveness of continuous cryotherapy after total knee arthroplasty.

== Cold spray anesthetics ==

In addition to their use in cryosurgery, several types of cold aerosol sprays are used for short-term pain relief. Unlike other cold modalities, it does not produce similar physiological effects due to the fact it decreases skin temperature, not muscle temperature. It reflexively inhibits underling muscle by using evaporation to cool the area. Ordinary spray cans containing tetrafluoroethane, dimethyl ether, or similar substances, are used to numb the skin prior to or possibly in place of local anesthetic injections, and prior to other needles, small incisions, sutures, and so on. Other products containing chloroethane are used to ease sports injuries, similar to ice pack therapy. Cold aerosol spray could also be used to relieve trigger points and improve range of motion. After applying the cold spray, one can stretch the muscle and will then have improved mobility and a decrease in pain immediately. However, this is only a short-term effect as the pain relief and improved range of motion can wear off within a minute.

== Whole body cryotherapy ==

An increasing amount of research is done on the effects of whole-body cryotherapy on exercise, beauty, and health. Research is often inconsistent because of the usage of the different types of cryo-chambers, and different treatment periods. However, it becomes increasingly clear that whole body cryotherapy has a positive effect on muscle soreness and decreases the recovery time after exercise. Some older papers show inconsistencies in the effects.

Cryotherapy is also increasingly used as a non-drug treatment against rheumatoid arthritis, stress, anxiety, or chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Studies for these, and other diseases (Alzheimer&#x27;s, migraines), are ongoing although more evidence becomes available on the positive effects of Whole Body Cryotherapy. The FDA points out that the effects of Whole Body Cryotherapy lacks evidence and should be researched more.

Cryotherapy treatment involves exposing individuals to extremely cold dry air (below −100 °C) for two to four minutes. Yet, three to four minute exposure to whole body cryotherapy is different from a one to two minute exposure. It is more beneficial to expose for a shorter amount of time to increase therapeutic benefits. Longer durations have negative effects on thermal sensation, tissue oxygenation, and blood volume. Also, the amount of sessions is an important part of the healing process. Just one session will not exhibit significant effects. A minimum of twenty sessions is required. Thirty sessions is recommended for optimal effects though. To achieve the subzero temperatures required for whole body cryotherapy, two methods are typically used: liquid nitrogen and refrigerated cold air. During these exposures, individuals wear minimal clothing, which usually consists of shorts for males, and shorts and a crop top for females. Gloves, a woollen headband covering the ears, and a nose and mouth mask, in addition to dry shoes and socks, are commonly worn to reduce the risk of cold-related injury. The first whole body cryotherapy chamber was built in Japan in the late 1970s, introduced to Europe in the 1980s, and has been used in the US and Australia in the past decade.

=== Adverse effects ===
Reviews of whole-body cryotherapy have called for research studies to implement active surveillance of adverse events, which are suspected of being underreported. If the cold temperatures are produced by evaporating liquid nitrogen, there is the risk of inert gas asphyxiation as well as frostbite. However, these risks are irrelevant in the electronically operated chambers.

=== Contraindications ===
Contraindications include patients with cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, acute infectious diseases, seizures, cold allergy, and some psychiatric disorders.

===Partial body===
Partial body cryotherapy devices also exist. If the cold temperatures are produced by evaporating liquid nitrogen, there is the risk of inert gas asphyxiation as well as frostbite.

<text>Pilning is a village in South Gloucestershire, England, close to Redwick and Severn Beach. Pilning is close to the M4, M49 and A403 roads, and has the South Wales Main Line railway running through it, with a minor station.

The civil parish is &quot;Pilning&quot; and Severn Beach. The population at the 2011 census was 3,647. An electoral ward exists in the same name.

Because of the close proximity of the River Severn and the English Stones section of the river bed, Pilning has found itself the ideal place to make both a substantial railway tunnel and motorway bridge. The Severn Tunnel opened in 1885 and the Second Severn Crossing opened in 1996.

==Landmarks==

The village is home to St Peters Primary School and a number of other amenities including a shop, a doctor&#x27;s surgery, and several pubs such as The King&#x27;s Arms. The Plough Inn hosts a jazz evening on the first Sunday of every month. Pilning Cricket Club was established in 1883.

The parish church of St Peter was completed in 1855 (consecrated 9 August), the principal architect was Thomas Henry Wyatt with H. Crisp. It also has a late 20th-century south extension in same style. It is a grade II listed building. The village also contains the St Mary&#x27;s Indian Orthodox Church.

Pilning had an annual Carnival, and an amateur dramatic society, &quot;The Village Players&quot;. At Christmas 2015 the &quot;Players&quot; put on a pantomime production of &quot;Mother Goose&quot;.

== Transport ==
Pilning railway station is located east of the village. As of 2023, only two eastbound trains a week serve the station due to the removal of the footbridge during Great Western Main Line electrification works.

Pilning is served hourly by bus route 12, operated by Stagecoach West, between Stoke Gifford (for ) and Severn Beach.

<text>Biyu (died 455, r. 427–455) was the twentieth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; he was Guisin&#x27;s son, while other sources name Biyu as the illegitimate son of the 18th king Jeonji. It is not known which sources are right. (Since Guisin died young, it is likely that the stories about Biyu being Jeonji&#x27;s son may be possible.)

The traditional dates of Biyu&#x27;s rule are based on the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. On the basis of more contemporaneous Chinese records, Best (1979) has suggested that the years 428 or 429–455 are more plausible.

Within the Korean peninsula, Biyu sought to strengthen Baekje&#x27;s relationship with Silla, exchanging ambassadors in 433 and 434. Although Silla was a protectorate of Goguryeo at this time, Silla and Baekje allied themselves against Goguryeo (Naje Dongmaeng; ).

<text>Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston (; 13 October 1874 – 6 March 1938) was a Scottish diplomat and colonial official who served as the tutor and advisor to Puyi, the last emperor of China. He was also the last British Commissioner of Weihaiwei. Johnston&#x27;s book &quot;Twilight in the Forbidden City&quot; (1934) was used as a source for Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s film dramatization of Puyi&#x27;s life &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;.

==Early life==
Johnston was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He studied at the University of Edinburgh and later was awarded a scholarship to read modern history at Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford Johnston had begun a friendship with Cecil Clementi. Both shared an interest in sinology; Clementi and Johnston would keep in contact for the rest of their lives.

In 1898, he joined the Colonial Service and was initially posted to Hong Kong. In 1904, he was transferred to the British leased territory at Weihaiwei on the coast of the Shandong Peninsula as a District Officer, working with Sir James Stewart Lockhart. For his extreme industry, Johnston was noted from his superiors as a capable colonial magistrate. Johnston was also a keen traveller. In 1902, he explored Tonkin, Laos and Siam. In 1904, he visited Kiautschou, Jinan, and later Korea. In January 1906, he undertook a year-long journey from Peking to Mandalay, publishing an account of his experiences in 1908.

A &quot;militant anti-Christian&quot; whose criticism of missionaries in China possibly hindered his promotion, Johnston was fascinated by Chinese Buddhism. In 1908, he had a private audience with the 13th Dalai Lama, one of the few westerners to do so. He wrote three books during his time in the service: &quot;From Peking to Mandalay&quot; (1908), &quot;Lion and Dragon in Northern China&quot; (1910), and &quot;Buddhist China&quot; (1913).

==Tutor to Puyi, in the Forbidden City==
Selected by the Colonial Office for his expertise in Chinese history and culture in 1919, he was appointed tutor of thirteen-year-old Puyi who still lived inside the Forbidden City in Peking as a non-sovereign monarch.

As the Scottish-born tutor to the Dragon Emperor, Johnston and Isabel Ingram, daughter of an American missionary and the empress&#x27;s tutor, were the only foreigners in history to be allowed inside the inner court of the Qing dynasty. Johnston carried high imperial titles and lived in both the Forbidden City and the New Summer Palace. Johnston met the Ming dynasty imperial descendant, Zhu Yuxun, the Marquis of Extended Grace, and arranged for him to meet Puyi in the Forbidden City.

More than a tutor, Johnston befriended the isolated adolescent. In his account of his time at the Forbidden City, Johnston notes the rampant corruption of the imperial household, with eunuchs selling off dynastic treasures. He obtained a bicycle and telephone for Pu Yi, and against the wishes of the retainers, much-needed spectacles.

After Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City in 1924, Johnston briefly served in an advisory capacity to Puyi before returning to his colonial service duties. Serving as Secretary to the British China Indemnity Commission (1926). In 1927, he was appointed the second civilian Commissioner at Weihaiwei. He ran the territory until it was returned to the Republic of China on 1 October 1930. Johnston tried to get the British diplomatic legation in Peking to host Puyi, and although the British authorities were not very interested in welcoming the former emperor, the British representative eventually gave Johnston his consent. However, he later discovered that Puyi - in view of the situation and against Johnston&#x27;s advice, had taken refuge in the Japanese legation after being advised by Zheng Xiaoxu.

==After China==

Johnston was appointed Professor of Chinese in the University of London in 1931, a post based at the School of Oriental and African Studies, to which he bequeathed his library in 1935. This library, one of the finest collections of Chinese and East Asian books in the country, consists of over 16,000 volumes. 

He retained his ties with Puyi, hosting one of his sisters and her husband at his house in Mortlake Road, Kew, in London during the 1930s, and even visited him in Manchukuo in July 1935.

Johnston retired in 1937, having acquired the small island of Eilean Rìgh in Loch Craignish, Scotland, Pu Yi granted Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston permission to fly the Imperial flag of Manchukuo on the Island, making it the only location outside of China to do so, and grew a Chinese style garden. After a short illness, he died in Edinburgh. In his will, he requested that no religious ceremony be conducted. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated. His ashes were scattered on his island and the surrounding loch.

He never married but was at one stage engaged to the historian Eileen Power, and was close to author Stella Benson. He was named as a respondent in the divorce of Elizabeth Sparshott, and was engaged to her at the time leading up to his death. Against his explicit request, Sparshott burned many of his materials and letters, including ones from Puyi&#x27;s childhood in the Forbidden City. Sparshott justified her actions by saying &quot;when a woman makes the supreme sacrifice for a man (her reputation) she probably feels too deeply to be able to identify herself with him for some long time&quot;.

Johnston&#x27;s book &quot;Twilight in the Forbidden City&quot; (1934) describes his experiences in Peking and was used as a source for Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s film dramatization of Puyi&#x27;s life &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;. He was portrayed by Peter O&#x27;Toole in the film.

<text>A Crown colony or royal colony was a colony governed by England, and then Great Britain or the United Kingdom within the English and later British Empire. There was usually a governor to represent the Crown, appointed by the British monarch on the advice of the UK Government, with or without the assistance of a local council. In some cases, this council was split into two: an executive council and a legislative council, and the executive council was similar to the Privy Council that advises the monarch. Members of executive councils were appointed by the governors, and British citizens resident in Crown colonies either had no representation in local government, or limited representation in a lower house. In several Crown colonies, this limited representation grew over time. As the House of Commons of the British Parliament has never included seats for any of the colonies, there was no direct representation in the sovereign government for British subjects or citizens residing in Crown colonies.

The administration of Crown colonies changed over time and in the 1800s some became, with a loosening of the power of royal governors, self-governing colonies, within which the sovereign state (the UK Government) delegated legislation for most local internal matters of governance to elected assemblies, with consent of the governor, overseen by the Colonial Office and the Board of Trade and Plantations. The Colonial Office gave way to the Dominion Office for some of these territories in 1925. Elected lower houses had their beginnings in the House of Burgesses of the Colony of Virginia in 1619 and the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda in 1620. While initially limited in government even with an elected lower house, over the centuries in some Crown colonies, more independent authority was given.

All remaining British colonies, whether Crown (such as the Falkland Islands) or self-governing (such as Bermuda), were renamed &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot; from 1 January 1983 under the British Nationality Act 1981. Many British citizens in the colonies (with the exceptions of the Falkland Islanders and subsequently the Gibraltarians) found that their &quot;Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies&quot; From 2002, the dependent territories have been known officially as British Overseas Territories.

==History==
Early English colonies were often proprietary colonies, usually established and administered by companies under charters granted by the monarch. The first &quot;royal colony&quot; was the Colony of Virginia, after 1624, when the Crown of the Kingdom of England revoked the royal charter it had granted to the Virginia Company and assumed control of the administration.

Executive crown governors are sometimes complemented by a locally appointed and/or elected legislature with limited powers – that is, such territories lack responsible government. For example, while the House of Assembly of Bermuda has existed continuously since its first session in 1620, Bermuda has only had responsible government since 1968. (Bermuda became a Crown colony in 1684, when the government revoked a royal charter given to the Somers Isles Company, successor to the Virginia Company, which had previously controlled administration, including the appointment of governors. Afterwards the British government appointed the Governor of Bermuda.)

Despite its later usage, the term &quot;Crown colony&quot; was used primarily, until the mid-19th century, to refer to colonies that had been acquired through wars, such as Trinidad and Tobago. After that time it was more broadly applied to every British territory other than British India, and self-governing colonies, such as the Province of Canada, Newfoundland, British Columbia, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and New Zealand.

By the mid-19th century, the monarch was appointing colonial governors only on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

===Reclassification (1981)===

The term Crown colony continued to be used until 1981, when the British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified the remaining British colonies as &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot;. By this time, the term &quot;Crown colony&quot; referred specifically to colonies lacking substantial autonomy, which were administered by an executive governor, appointed by the British Government – such as Hong Kong, before its transfer in 1997 to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 2002, the &quot;British Overseas Territories Act 2002&quot; further changed their name to British Overseas Territories.

==Types==
There were &quot;three&quot; types of Crown colony as of 1918, with differing degrees of autonomy:

Crown colonies &quot;with representative councils&quot;, such as Bermuda, Jamaica, Ceylon and Fiji, contained two legislative chambers, consisting of Crown-appointed and locally elected members.

Crown colonies &quot;with nominated councils&quot;, such as British Honduras, Sierra Leone, British Windward Islands and Hong Kong, were staffed entirely by Crown-appointed members, with some appointed representation from the local population. Hong Kong had a representative council following the introduction of election for the Hong Kong Legislative Council in 1995.

Crown colonies &quot;ruled directly by a governor&quot;, such as Basutoland, Gibraltar, Saint Helena and Singapore, were fewest in number and had the least autonomy.

<doc id="1166708" wikidata="Q445419" url="?curid=1166708" title="Andy Priaulx">
<text>Andrew Graham Priaulx, MBE ( born 7 August 1974) is a British racing driver from Guernsey. In 2019 he raced for Ford Chip Ganassi Team UK in the FIA World Endurance Championship, and Cyan Racing Lynk &amp; Co in the FIA World Touring Car Cup, having been a former BMW factory driver.

He is a European Touring Car Championship champion, three times World Touring Car Championship champion and the only FIA Touring Car champion to win an international-level championship for four consecutive years (2004 to 2007). The previous record was Roberto Ravaglia&#x27;s three successive championships (1986–1988).

==Racing career==
Born in Guernsey, Priaulx has competed in many types of motorsport, beginning in karting at the minimum age of eight. After a brief flirtation with powerboat racing, he started hillclimbing while still a teenager, sharing a car with his father Graham. It was quickly apparent that he had great natural ability, and few people were surprised when he took the British Hillclimb Championship title in 1995.

After this, he made the switch to circuit racing, where after a relatively low-key couple of years in Formula Renault UK Championship and British Formula 3 he eventually demonstrated his skills were transferable by switching to the Renault Spider championship in 1998, completely dominating it in 1999. His career stalled somewhat when he returned to British Formula 3 in 2000–01. He had some success at this level, but despite finishing sixth in the championship in 2001 was unable to progress further up the single-seater ladder.

===Touring cars===

In 2001 Priaulx had a pair of British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) guest drives for the Egg Vauxhall team, standing in for the suspended Phil Bennett. He stunned the regulars by taking pole position on his debut at Oulton Park, demonstrating that his future appeared to lie in that direction.

The following year he was signed by the works Honda BTCC team for their 2002 campaign. He won one race and finished on the podium in two others, and the following season was signed by Bart Mampaey&#x27;s BMW UK team for their European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) effort. He was in contention for the title until late in the year, eventually finishing third. Priaulx also occasionally guested in Australian V8 Supercar racing, competing at the Bathurst 1000km in 2002 with Yvan Muller in a Kmart Racing Commodore and 2003 with Cameron McLean again in a Kmart Commodore, and also the Sandown 500 km in 2003.

2004 saw Priaulx win a major circuit racing championship, as he became ETCC champion after a season-long battle with Dirk Müller. Both men obtained the same number of points, but Priaulx had won five races as against Müller&#x27;s three, and this was sufficient to hand the Priaulx the title.

Priaulx repeated his 2004 success in 2005, 2006 and 2007, clinching the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC, essentially the same series, with two races outside Europe in 2005 and three in 2006) at the final round in Macau. In 2005, he won the crown with two second-place finishes in the final round when his nearest rivals, Dirk Müller and Fabrizio Giovanardi both failed to score. The following year, a win in the opening race of the final meeting left him needing to finish fifth in the final event to beat Jörg Müller by a single point, which he achieved.
Heading into the final meeting of the 2007 WTCC season at Macau, Priaulx was joint leader of the championship alongside former BTCC champion Yvan Muller. He came eighth in the first race and won from pole position in the second race to claim his and BMW&#x27;s third WTCC championship in a row.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.Priaulx again raced in the World Touring Car Championship for BMW Team UK in 2009, finishing fourth in the standings. As well as the WTCC, he competed in selected rounds of the American Le Mans Series for BMW and a number of races in the Australian V8 Supercars championship, driving a Walkinshaw Racing Holden with David Reynolds at the Phillip Island and Bathurst endurance races.

In 2010, Priaulx continued to race in the World Touring Car Championship for BMW and competed in several races for BMW in the Le Mans Series, 2010 Armor All Gold Coast 600 in V8 Supercars with Craig Lowndes, Race of Champions, as well as the Le Mans 24 Hours.On 5 December 2010, BMW announced that it would not be continuing its factory effort in the World Touring Car Championship from 2011 onwards. It was announced on 25 January 2011, that Priaulx contest the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup for BMW, as well as undertaking testing duties for BMW with cars from other racing categories.
Priaulx spent the 2012 and 2013 seasons racing for BMW in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, scoring his best result in the final round of the 2013 season at the Hockenheimring, where he finished in sixth after starting in third. He switched to racing in the United SportsCar Championship in the United States for 2014. In January 2015 it was announced at Autosport International that Priaulx would return to the British Touring Car Championship for 2015 with West Surrey Racing, campaigning a BMW 125i M Sport, combining his BTCC programme with racing works BMWs in the European Le Mans Series and the North American Endurance Cup.

On 10 December 2018, it was announced that Priaulx will join Lynk &amp; Co Cyan Racing for the 2019 World Touring Car Cup season, partnering former WTCC champions Yvan Muller, Thed Björk and Yvan&#x27;s nephew Yann Ehrlacher. On 17 November 2019, Priaulx secured his maiden win in the FIA World Touring Car Cup in Macau.

===Ford WEC===

On 5 December 2015, it was announced that Priaulx had parted ways with BMW after a 13-year stint with the German manufacturer to join Ford Chip Ganassi Team UK for their upcoming debut in the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship season. He was officially unveiled as a Ford driver on 5 January 2016 alongside teammates Marino Franchitti, Stefan Mücke, and Olivier Pla.

==Personal life==
Priaulx&#x27;s son Sebastian Priaulx is also a racing driver. He competed in the 2019 British GT Championship and was in contention for the GT4 title, driving with Scott Maxwell, but lost out on the title to Tom Canning and Ash Hand by 8.5 points.

==Nationality==
Priaulx is from Guernsey, a crown dependency of the United Kingdom. As a proud Guernseyman, Priaulx has always incorporated the Guernsey flag prominently in his helmet designs. He has occasionally been mistakenly identified as French due to his surname, which is common in Francophone countries; a French national flag was displayed above the podium at the first race in Curitiba in the 2007 WTCC season.

<text>Large and complex financial institutions (LCFI) are systemically important financial institutions, also referred to colloquially as bulge bracket banks, that if they failed would cause a Systemic banking crisis. The term is used in the context of systemic risk which concerns central banks, financial regulators and the Bank for International Settlements and has led to the term too big to fail.

There are regulatory measures to limit the risk of failure in a Large and Complex Financial Institution. All banks operate under the Basel Capital Accords, set up by the Bank for International Settlements, and their &#x27;Risk&#x27; departments enforce &quot;BIS 1&quot; and &quot;BIS 2&quot; risk accounting regimes. These are complex sets of rules allowing the bank – and its regulators – to know how much money is at risk in trading positions, no matter how complex, and how much &#x27;regulatory&#x27; capital&#x27; must be set aside as a buffer against each trade going sour. They also try to avoid concentration risk with one counterparty, no matter how large they may be. 

That last measure – the counterparty risk limit – is every market player&#x27;s best protection against the failure of a trading partner. And if that player was the only company hit by their trading partner&#x27;s bankruptcy, or one of a few dozen players caught in the same position, they would all be safe. However if every market player, everywhere and in every market took the same hit the results can be the failure of the financial system or &#x27;systemic risk&#x27;.

== History ==
Central bankers have had to deal with large institution going bust, an example is Barings in 1995. A concern for financial regulators has been to ensure that depositors are protected from the failure of a retail bank, but the regulators&#x27; main concern with a investment bank is to ensure that there isn&#x27;t a damaging loss of confidence in the banking system, and that all the trades, transactions and all the types of financial contracts are wound up in an orderly way. If they are not, and all the traders and investors are suddenly forced to meet their obligations or liquidate their positions on the same day, there would be a crisis in the market and many institutions, rather than just the one, would probably go bust or at least suffer substantial losses in a dangerous spiral of falling prices and forced selling.

This is the background story to Long-Term Capital Management: there are many published articles on why that particular hedge fund failed, but very few on the systemic risk of all LTCM&#x27;s counterparties attempting to unwind their positions at once. This is why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York intervened and organised a $3 billion bailout. 

Worse, at least one major European bank had &#x27;hedged&#x27; or laid off risk on a significant percentage of its trading book by derivatives trades with LTCM &quot;but was a significant investor in LTCM itself&quot;. In other words, they had sold on the risks to LTCM, while buying back into them. Even without such errors, there is the worry that positions we think are hedged (effectively &#x27;insured&#x27; against adverse market movements) might lose that protection when the counterparty who sold those derivatives goes broke. An event which would, by its very nature, occur on the very day the markets go crazy. 

Nobody knows what would happen if one of the world&#x27;s largest banks became severely distressed and was forced to suspend trading, except to say that it would be far worse than long-term capital management: firstly, because they have ongoing trades with every significant market player, everywhere; secondly, because the sums of money are so much larger. A bulge-bracket bank will, on any given day, have over a ten trillion dollars of open trades on the foreign exchange markets and in derivatives.

<doc id="1166727" wikidata="Q7457443" url="?curid=1166727" title="Seven Society">
<text>The Seven Society (founded 1905) is the most secretive of the University of Virginia&#x27;s secret societies. Members are only revealed after their death when a wreath of black magnolias in the shape of a &quot;7&quot; is placed at the gravesite, the bell tower of the University Chapel chimes at seven-second intervals on the seventh dissonant chord when it is seven past the hour, and a notice is published in the university&#x27;s Alumni News, and often in the &quot;Cavalier Daily&quot;. The most visible tradition of the society is the painting of the logo of the society, the number 7 surrounded by the signs for alpha (A), omega (Ω), and infinity (∞), and sometimes several stars, upon many buildings around the grounds of the university.

There is no clear history of the founding of the society. There is a legend that, of eight men who planned to meet for a card game, only seven showed up, and they formed the society. Other histories claim that the misbehavior of other secret societies, specifically the Hot Feet (later the IMP Society), led University President Edwin A. Alderman to call both the Hot Feet and the Z Society into his office and suggest that a more &quot;beneficial organization&quot; was needed.

The only known method to successfully contact the Seven Society is to place a letter at the Thomas Jefferson statue inside the university&#x27;s historic Rotunda (accounts differ on the exact placement of the letter, either on the base or in the crook of the statue&#x27;s arm).

==Philanthropic gifts==

The group contributes financially to the university, announcing donations with letters signed only with seven astronomical symbols in the order: Earth, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, Neptune, Uranus, and Venus. The Society gives large monetary donations and scholarships to the university each year in quantities that include the number 7, e.g. $777 or $1,777. Significant past gifts to the university include the Seven Society Carillon in the UVA Chapel, donated in memory of deceased members of the society, and given with the request that there should be a toll of seven times seven bells on the passing of a member; a memorial to past Seven Society members who gave their lives in World War I; $17,777.77 for a loan fund in honor of university president John Lloyd Newcomb; the ceremonial mace carried in academic processions; $10,777.77 in support of the re-establishment of Homecomings; a plaque on the Rotunda honoring University students who died in the Korean War; $7,077.77 to endow the Ernest Mead Fund for the Music Library; $47,777.77 for the making of a film on the honor system; and $1 million in support of the university&#x27;s South Lawn Project. Most recently, the society gave a $777,777.77 grant to fund the Mead Endowment, founded in honor of Ernest Mead, which awards grants to professors to teach their &quot;dream classes.&quot;

In addition to granting spontaneous gifts, the Seven Society sponsors an annual $7,000 graduate fellowship award for superb teaching.

==Notable members==
The Seven Society is unusual among University of Virginia secret societies in including members who were not students or alumni of the university. Notable examples include Mary Proffitt, secretary to Dean James M. Page and Dean Ivey F. Lewis; and Ivey F. Lewis himself, a non-alumnus professor and longtime dean of students at the university.

Several notable individuals whose Seven Society membership was disclosed at their death include:
* H. Lockwood Frizzell, professional football player with the Philadelphia Eagles
*William Halsey Jr., United States Navy admiral
*Frank Hereford, fifth president of the University of Virginia and namesake of Hereford College
*James Rogers McConnell, student and volunteer for the Lafayette Escadrille during World War I, memorialized in Gutzon Borglum&#x27;s statue &quot;The Aviator&quot;
*Ernest Mead, professor of music and chair of the McIntire Department of Music at UVA
*John Lloyd Newcomb, second president of the University of Virginia
*Edward Stettinius, Jr., secretary of state under Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, and first US ambassador to the United Nations
*Frank Wisner, head of the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Directorate of Plans during the 1950s
*Joseph W. Twinam, United States Ambassador to Bahrain

== Other organizations ==
There have been several secret societies with &quot;seven&quot; in their name. No connection between the societies has been shown, but there is at least some tradition in the use of the names.

One such secret society is the Seven Society, Order of the Crown and Dagger at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The founding date of the William and Mary society is reported to have been as early as 1826.

The Mystical Seven was founded in 1837 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. It expanded to include eleven chapters or temples at other colleges and universities. The society died in 1890, with its surviving chapters merging into national fraternities. It was restarted as a local honorary at Wesleyan University in the late 19th century.

The Mystical Seven was founded in 1907 at the University of Missouri. It recognizes students who have demonstrated leadership and characters.

Another unassociated secret society operates at Longwood University. The society known as Princeps, was founded on seven principles of leadership. Members are selected during their undergraduate career and are not revealed until graduation by wearing a crimson sash bearing the number seven. The group recognizes and honors citizens of the Longwood community who are exceptional leaders and its motto is &quot;to lead is to serve&quot;. Its symbol is a black seven-pointed crown and the number 7, representing the principles of leadership. Students often step on the black seven-pointed crowns painted around campus for good luck. Princeps attaches paper sevens to the doors of academic achieving students each semester; black sevens indicate dean&#x27;s list and red sevens indicated president&#x27;s list.

<text>Jim in Bold is a documentary about Jim Wheeler, a gay high school student in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, who died by suicide in 1997 because of constant harassment at school. The film was created by the Equality Forum and directed by Glenn Holsten. The original music was composed by Michael Aharon.

==Synopsis==
The film, titled after a poem by Wheeler, details the abuse he received at the hands of his classmates because of his homosexuality. It also presents interviews and a cross-nation road-trip with members of &quot;Young Gay America&quot;, an online teen organization for gays, and compares the teasing and physical abuse Jim suffered to the increasingly open attitudes towards homosexuality six years later when the film was first shown.

==Screenings and reactions==
The film premiered at the Equality Forum 2003 on May 1 at The Kimmel Center in Philadelphia. A later showing, held September 28, 2003, at the Pennsylvania State Museum in Harrisburg as a fundraiser for Common Roads, a local gay youth support group, was protested by 10 members of the Westboro Baptist Church, a religious institution well known for their extreme anti-gay views. Because they announced their intention to protest in advance, they were overwhelmed by over 800 counter-protesters who declared the day &quot;Unity Day&quot;. The counter-protest was organized by the Pride Festival of Central Pennsylvania led by community organizer Reynaldo Lacaba.

<doc id="1166736" wikidata="Q5309391" url="?curid=1166736" title="Drury Hotels">
<text>Drury Hotels Company, LLC is an American hospitality company that operates a chain of mid-scale limited service hotels under the brands Drury Inn and Suites, Drury Plaza Hotel, and Pear Tree Inn. As of 2024, the chain operates more than 150 locations in 27 states. It is wholly owned by the Drury family and is headquartered in metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri.

== History ==
The company was founded by the sons of Lambert Drury, a farmer who lost his farm during the Great Depression, and then founded a plastering company. The Drury Development Corporation was founded in 1959. The Drury family built its first hotel, a Holiday Inn, in 1962 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The family started Drury Hotels in 1973 and built its first Drury Inn in Sikeston, Missouri. The Drury Hotels company operates non-Drury hotels as well. In the 1990s, the chain introduced a third brand, Thrifty Inn.

Co-founder Charles Drury died on September 7, 2020, in St. Louis; his death was acknowledged by Governor of Missouri Mike Parson. Two other co-founders, James and Robert, died in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

In 2024, Drury Hotels earned its 18th J.D. Power award for highest guest satisfaction in upper midscale hotels.

Drury Hotels was ranked the highest in the brand category for hotels in Forbes&#x27; List of Customer Service All-Stars 2024 and highest in the brand category for hotels in Forbes&#x27; List of Best Customer Service 2024. Forbes also recognized Drury Hotels as one of America&#x27;s Best Midsize Employers in 2024.

Drury Hotels opened two hotels in 2024 in Savannah, Georgia and Arlington, Texas, with hotels in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Florence, Kentucky expected to open later this year.

== Renovation of historic buildings ==
The chain has purchased several historic buildings for renovation as hotels. Historic buildings that the chain has renovated into hotels include the Union Market in St. Louis (originally built in 1925), the former Cleveland Board of Education building in Cleveland (originally built in 1931) the former City Public Service Building (originally built in 1921) and the former Alamo National Bank building (originally built in 1929) in San Antonio; a hotel in Wichita, Kansas originally built in 1922 a former Sisters of Charity dormitory and hospital in Santa Fe, originally built in 1910 and the early 1950s; and three St. Louis properties originally built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The former Federal Reserve building in Pittsburgh was renovated into a 207-room hotel and opened in late 2016. At the Pittsburgh hotel, a former firing range was converted into an indoor pool, and former bank vaults were turned into meeting spaces. It also plans to renovate the former First Financial Centre building in Milwaukee and the former &quot;Indianapolis Business Journal&quot; building in Indianapolis, which dates to 1924.

<doc id="1166739" wikidata="Q1999060" url="?curid=1166739" title="Angústias">
<text>Angústias is one of the three &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) that comprise the urban area of the city of Horta, on the island of Faial in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. This is an economically active, densely populated area. The population in 2011 was 2,418, in an area of 3.79 km2. Due to its commercial nature, the parish is one of the island&#x27;s primary destinations for tourism, due to the concentration of historical sights and shopping. It contains the localities Caminho do Meio, Courelas, Pasteleiro, Port Pim, Termo da Igreja and Vigia.

== History ==
The first recorded reference to settlers in the area of Angústias referred to the (in 1532). Since 1468, the island and parish had been under the administration of Josse van Huerter, a Flemish leader during the early colonization of the island of Faial. The settlement and growth of the village of Orta (later Horta) was concentrated in two nuclei: an interior settlement in the valley of Flamengos and the southwestern religious parish of &quot;Nossa Senhora das Angústias&quot; ().

Several smaller agglomerations developed within the area of Angústias. Porto Pim, a sheltered bay between &quot;Monte Escuro&quot; and &quot;Monte da Guia&quot;, became a natural refuge for the first colonists, where they could easily load and unload cargo and supplies. Along the southern coast, the area of Pasteleiro, became the site of the first commercial businesses associated with the pastel or woad industry (first started by van Huerter). On the western edge of Horta Bay, the first homes were constructed, around the small chapel of Santa Cruz (where Josse van Huerter and his wife, Beatriz de Macedo, were buried). 
In 1567, the Fort of Santa Cruz was built for the defense of the island. Unfortunately, these fortifications, the convents and many of the churches, were sacked by English privateers in 1589 and 1597, and the buildings burned to the ground. By the beginning of the 17th century, several new military/defensive structures were built in order to protect the growing community, including the Military Doors of Porto Pim (), the Fort of São Sebastião (), the Fort of Greta (), and the Fort of Nossa Senhora da Guia ().

The Chapel of Santa Bárbara () was later constructed in Angústias by the Flemish nobleman Pero Pasteleiro and his wife Madelana da Rosa.

Originally completed in 1522, through the initiative of Friar Pedro da Atouguia, the Convent of São Francisco () was originally built on a site called &quot;Pedras dos Frades&quot; (along the coastal boulevard where a compass rose was constructed in the 20th Century). It was sacked and set ablaze in 1597 by English privateers, later destroyed during a storm, after being re-constructed in 1609. A third convent and church was re-constructed in 1696 on higher ground and farther away from the coast. On November 12, 1700, it was reconsecrated as the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary (). Its principal benefactor, Simão Liuz Carolo, was moved from Angra do Heroísmo to a mausoleum in the main chapel on the 4 November 1700. With the end of the religious orders in 1835, the convent was donated to the &quot;Santa Casa da Misericórdia&quot;, which installed its hospital and &quot;Asilo de Mendicidade&quot;. On 4 May 1899, a violent fire completely destroyed the convent: the Church survived.

The civil parish of Nossa Senhora das Angústias was formed on 28 November 1684. Frair Lourenço, Bishop of Angra, on 30 August 1675, finally initiated the construction of a church in the name of Santa Cruz. In 1688, after a visit of Bishop Clemente Vieria, the parish received 572$000 réis for the construction. It would eventually be constructed in 1800 and receive the name Church of Nossa Senhora das Angústias: its bell-towers were finished in 1861.
Between 1839 and 1969, due to the developments in the telegraph industries, Horta (and Angústias in particular) was the central node in the trans-Atlantic submarine cable network. The basing of English, American and German telegraph companies in Angústias resulted in urban and social growth. Many of the buildings constructed during this period have become integral to the landscape of the parish, including the Hotel Faial, the homes and businesses of the Dabney family, the &quot;Colonia Alemã&quot; and several of the original buildings constructed to house the telegraph equipment.

By October 20, 1876, the commercial port was constructed; it became an important trans-Atlantic point, as an Allied port during both World Wars, a stopover for hydroplanes crossing the Atlantic and way-point for Dutch Atlantic tugboats. In the early years, the dock came to supplement, then supplant, the harbor of Porto Pim for whaling vessels involved in the North Atlantic whale hunt. A new marina was eventually inaugurated (June 3, 1986) to handle the annual growth in yachts and pleasure craft to the region. The marina is celebrated in yachting circles for the hundreds of yacht calling cards painted on the walks and walls by visiting crews.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

This urbanized parish&#x27;s northern border begins at the Horta Marina, and crosses through commercial buildings to the &quot;Ramp do São Francisco&quot; and alongside the &quot;Santa Casa da Misericórdia&quot; (the &quot;Rua da Santa Casa&quot;) before intersecting the property-line of the former Dabney residence &quot;The Cedars&quot;, following the &quot;Rua Luís de Camões&quot;, until intersecting at &quot;Rua da Ilha do Pico&quot;. From this point the border follows &quot;Rua Ilha do Pico&quot; until &quot;Rua do Moínho&quot;, where it skirts Monte Carneiro until reaching the border with Flamengos. The western border follows &quot;Calço da Fugeuira&quot; for several metres before extending westerly into the pasturelands of Pasteleiro, where it plunges south through the industrial zone, crossing the &quot;Via-Rápida&quot; and the &quot;Rua do Lajinho&quot; until reaching the sea. The parish encompasses an area that extends from the civil parish of Feteiras along the southern coast of Faial, to the port area of the city of Horta. It includes the bay of Port Pim, Monte da Guia and Monte Escuro, and a small portion of Monte Carneiro. It is fronted on the north by the civil parish of Matriz and Flamengos, while completely surrounded on all other borders by the Atlantic Ocean.

The parish is part of the Horta-Flamengos-Feteira geomorphological zone referred to as the &quot;Horta Platform&quot; localized along the southeast portion of the island, and characterized by a low altitude, smooth relief created from several lava flow covers. The area includes many Strombolian cones (including Monte Carneiro), in addition to the Monte da Guia Tuff Surtseyan cone. These volcanic cones are linked together by smoothly planed areas which consist of lava flows with pumice or sedimentary materials.

====Ecoregions/protected areas====
Sections of the Nature Park of Faial are included within the boundaries of the civil parish, including:
* Nature Reserve of the Caldeirinhas (), totally surrounded by the Monte da Guia landscape, the special nature reserve of Caldeirinhas refers to the internal crater open to the southern ocean at the base of Monte da Guia;
* Protected Area for the Management of Resources of the Faial-Pico Channel (), is a protected zone that covers the southwestern corner of Faial and across to Pico, hugging the coast along Angustias, but also the adjacent parishes of Feteira, Matriz, Conceição, Praia de Almoxarife, Pedro Miguel and Ribeirinha;
* Protected Landscape of Monte da Guia (), this protected landscape comprises most of the southeastern portion of the parish, covering an area of about 73 hectares, that includes the cinder cones &quot;Monte Queimado&quot; and &quot;Monte da Guia&quot;, as well as the isthmus that connects the two structures (referred to as &quot;Entre-Montes&quot;) forming the beach of Porto Pim.
Also within the borders of Angústias is the cinder cone of Monte Carneiro, to the west, along its frontier with the parish of Flamengos. The hilltop is the highest elevation in the parish, with views to the urbanized area of Horta.

===Human geography===
This is a hilly area that includes several slag/spatter cones (the aforementioned Monte da Guia, Monte Escuro and Monte Carneiro are all extinct cones), as well as rugged coastal areas and public sand beaches (the beach at Porto Pim). The area includes several pasture-lands but is generally urbanized, with an industrial area located in the west along an ancillary branch of the Regional E.R.2-1a motorway, a residential neighbourhood along the southwest coast, and portion of the central city of Horta in the northeast coast. Along with the main Regional E.R.1-1a roadway, which follows the coast from the marina to Feteiras, the Regional E.R.2-2a variant (&quot;Estrada Príncipe Alberto do Mónaco&quot;-&quot;Estrada Regional de Santa Bárbara&quot;) extends from the intersection at the Church of Nossa Senhora das Angústias northwest to Flamengos, while the expressway (the &quot;Via-Rápida&quot;) to Feteiras begins at a traffic circle around the locality of Santa Bárbara.

Many of the important civic, cultural or regional buildings are located in Angústias, including the islands only secondary school (EBS Escola Secundária Manuel Arriaga), the only hospital () on the island, the headquarters of the police, the commercial marina, dock and container terminal, the principal installations of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia (the benevolent society that homes the elderly) and the supermarket (Modelo). It also includes historical portions of the &quot;village of Orta&quot;, including the main commercial and residential buildings that formed the community in the late 19th century.

==Economy==
While the western part of the parish is utilized as pasturelands, or for cultivation, the urbanized nature of the eastern part has concentrated on tertiary and municipal services. The Industrial Zone of Santa Barbara between the Via-Rápida and Rua das Courelas is the main secondary nucleus of industrial activity, in addition to the commercial container and fishing port along the eastern coast of Faial.

== Architecture ==

Being one of the nuclei of the city of Horta, Angústias is the home of many buildings important to the history of the region. Some of these have been renovated and reused for other purposes (for example the Fort of Santa Cruz), while others have become important as tourist attractions (for example Peter&#x27;s Cafe) or continued to be active in the community (such as the Church of Nossa Senhora das Angústias).

===Civic===
* Captaincy of the Port of Horta (), part of the security and economic fiscalization of imports/exports, the Art-Deco style building located across from Cais de Santa Cruz is classified a &quot;Property of Public Interest&quot;;
* German Colonial Estate ()

() - located along &quot;Rua Nova&quot;, between the bays of Porto Pim and Horta, the old offices/warehouses of Reis &amp; Martins were important in the construction and maintenance of motor launches and whaling boats, reaching its importance around 1946, when it was the most influential supply centre for the whaling industry on Faial. The original founders were Francisco Marcelino dos Reis, Joaquim Martins Amaral Júnior and Tomas Alberto Azevedo, who much later became associated with Costa &amp; Martins, Lda. (another important supplier), and worked closely in partnership with the whaling company Companhia Baleeira Faialense, Lda, then the largest whaling company on the island. It was completely purchased by the Lisboete Francisco Marcelino dos Reis in 1940, where for the next 40 years it prospered as the &quot;Centro Nevrálgico da Baleação no Faial&quot;, then declining in importance with the fall of whaling in the region, and closing completely in 1981 (even as the last whale was hunted in 1987). The site fell into decay, housing several whaling boats, historical implements, construction materials and artifacts, before being analyzed by the Sea Observatory of the Azores ().

Its utility was called into question with successive defeats and did little more than garrison troops that saw little action after the Liberal Wars.

<doc id="1166743" wikidata="Q3512163" url="?curid=1166743" title="Broadway, Sydney">
<text>Broadway is a road in inner city Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The road constitutes the border between the suburbs of Ultimo (to the north) and Chippendale (to the south). Broadway is also an urban locality.

Broadway connects the south end of George Street where it terminates at the junction with Harris and Regent streets, and runs west to the junction of Parramatta Road and City Road at Victoria Park. Broadway and Parramatta Road are part of the Great Western Highway.

==History==

Broadway is historically important because it is one of the first roads built in the colony of New South Wales, in 1794. It had been called &quot;George Street South&quot; and then &quot;George Street West&quot;. After being widened in 1906 when the Central railway station was built, George Street west of Railway Square, it became known as &quot;The Broadway&quot;. This name was subsequently shortened to just &quot;Broadway&quot;.

In the early nineteenth century, travel to Parramatta on Parramatta Road attracted a toll and this was charged from the area now known as Railway Square. The toll gate was subsequently moved to the approximate junction of the present Broadway and Parramatta Road.

St Benedict&#x27;s Church on Parramatta Road (now incorporated into the University of Notre Dame campus) is the oldest consecrated Catholic Church in Australia. It was the parish church of Norman Gilroy, the first Australian to become a cardinal.

Broadway was once a major retailing centre, and for 90 years was home to the flagship complex of department store chain Grace Bros. The complex consisted of two stores on either side of Bay Street. It was visited by Queen Elizabeth II during her 1954 visit to Australia. Retailing on Broadway declined and the store was eventually closed in 1995. Today this site contains the Broadway Shopping Centre on the western side and the UniLodge on Broadway on the eastern side.

The southern side of the road was dominated by the Carlton &amp; United brewery. The brewery closed in December 2006 and the site was sold on 29 June 2007. The site has been redeveloped into a mixed use precinct called Central Park, which includes a new public park located just off Broadway of approximately in size, and a new tower called One Central Park designed by Jean Nouvel and featuring &quot;vertical gardens&quot; by Patrick Blanc. Located opposite the University of Technology Sydney, One Central Park is an apartment complex with a shopping centre called Central located on the lower levels.

==Transport==
Broadway was a busy tram thoroughfare in the first half of the 20th century, until the line&#x27;s closure in 1958. Since then it has been the primary entry point into the central business district for bus services from the Inner West currently operated by Transit Systems..

==Education==
A number of educational institutions are located on or around Broadway. These include the International Grammar School (IGS), University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), University of Notre Dame, University of Sydney and the Sydney Institute of TAFE.

UTS has a particularly strong presence. The UTS Tower is the tallest structure on Broadway and is a Sydney landmark. Designed in the brutalist style, it has been described as one of Sydney&#x27;s ugliest buildings. An adjacent building on Broadway designed by Denton Corker Marshall was completed in 2014. There are also plans to redesign the podium of the tower.

==Other buildings==
==In popular culture==
Part of the video for singer David Bowie&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, took place on Broadway in front of the University of Notre Dame Australia.

<text>Faial is a civil parish in the Madeiran municipality of Santana located along the northern coast of the island of Madeira. The population in 2011 was 1,567, in an area of 24.03 km².

==History==
It was founded on February 20, 1550 by settlers who chose the name &quot;Faial&quot;, for the common name for the Myrica faya, shrubs that are indigenous to the area, growing within the valleys between the mountains. As later recounted, the settlers:

:&quot;Seeing a site of Faias, where the sea is more gentle, with an ideal panorama, that perfect corner, is the vista of Faial.&quot; 

For a while Porto da Cruz and São Roque do Faial were part of the parish, but were de-annexed to form their own parishes.

In 1519, a chapel was constructed in this parish to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Natividade (English: &quot;Our Lady of the Nativity&quot;), and as legend describes it was built entirely from one cedar, which was transported by water to its site. Ribeiras da Metade e do Faial. The construction of the new temple was begun during the reign of King D. João V of Portugal, during the second half of the 18th Century (1771). In addition, a chapel was dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Penha de França (English: &quot;Our Lady of the Rock of France&quot;), in Fazenda, around 1680.

In 1960, a fire completely destroyed the original church in Faial, and it was reconstructed in 1966 through the initiative of Father António Pestana Martinho.

==Geography==
The parish is located between the municipal of seat of Santana and the parish of São Roque do Faial, 21 kilometres north Funchal the regional capital, while 5 kilometres from Porto da Cruz, 15 kilometres from Machico and 39 kilometres from Porto Moniz; it is connected to these centres by a Regional Roadway network that gives its inhabitants limited access to southern communities.

Faial consists of the localities Moinhos, Longueira, Penha De Águia, Fajã, Lombo de Cima, Lombo de Baixo, Cruzinhas, Fajã Grande, Limoeiro, Fajã da Murta, Lombo Galego, Pico do Lombo Galego, Quebrada, Água De Alto, Ressoca, Corujeira de Cima, Corujeira de Baixo, Fazenda, Diferença, Lombo Lourenço, Igreja, Covas, Pico do Guindaste, Guindaste and Fajã do Mar.

<text>Gaero (?–475, 455–475) was the 21st king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the eldest son of the 20th king Biyu. He died on Achasan as Baekje&#x27;s capital in the present-day Pungnaptoseong region fell to the northern rival kingdom Goguryeo.

==Reign==
He attempted to strengthen royal control of the aristocracy, by selecting officials from his own Buyeo clan, at the expense of the powerful Hae and Jin clans.

In 469, he ordered a surprise attack in which the city of Cheongmongnyeon (청목령, 靑木嶺 ; near modern Kaesong) was retaken from Goguryeo. In 472, he sent an embassy bearing tribute to Northern Wei requesting support against Goguryeo&#x27;s attacks. However, these advances were rebuffed by the Wei court, which tried to avoid war with Goguryeo which had greater military power at the time, while fighting against Southern Dynasties.

In the early 470s, according to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, King Jangsu of Goguryeo sent a Buddhist monk named Dorim, who was actually a Goguryeo agent. Dorim used Gaero&#x27;s passion for the game of baduk to ingratiate himself, and persuade the king to neglect the country&#x27;s defense in favor of public works.

==Fall of the capital==
In 475, Jangsu launched an attack with 30,000 men and overran Baekje&#x27;s defenses in seven days, taking the Han River valley including the capital. Gaero was taken to Acha Mountain Fortress and slain by two men who had defected to Goguryeo from Baekje. Baekje&#x27;s ally Silla sent an army of 10,000, but arrived too late.

He was the last to rule Baekje from its historic heartland in the Han River valley. After his death, Hae Gu, of the suppressed Hae clan, led a bloody revolt.

==Family==
* Father: Biyu of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Queen: unknown
*** Buyeo Modo (扶餘牟都, ?–477) – 22nd King of Baekje, Munju of Baekje.
*** Buyeo Gonji (餘餘昆支, ?–477) – military commander and father of 24th King of Baekje, Dongseong of Baekje. He was sent to Japan in 461 where he had a son with a Japanese woman.

==Popular culture==
* Portrayed by Lee Ki-young in the 2013 MBC TV series &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter, Soo Baek-hyang&quot;.

<text>Book and Snake or The Society of Book and Snake is a secret society for seniors at Yale University. It was established in 1863 and is the fourth-oldest secret society at Yale. Current NASA administrator Bill Nelson is a noted alumnus.

== History ==

Sigma Delta Chi Society was established by students at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College on November 17, 1863, as a three-year society. The society secured rooms on the top floor of a building on College Street and Chapel Street where they held weekly meetings. When it outgrew that space, the society moved to the top floor of 953 Chapel Street.

In 1876, the society incorporated in Connecticut as the Stone Trust Corporation so that it could own property and hold money. This name honored Lewis Bridge Stone, an early member of the society. On campus, Sigma Delta Chi changed its name to Book and Snake because its members did not want to be confused with a national fraternity; the group already had the nickname Book and Snake because of its pin. In addition, the society moved to 36 Elm Street and created the first social dormitory at Yale. Member John Hays Hammond named the dormitory Cloister.

Because its house was called Cloister, the society received the nickname Cloister Club. The Cloister Club grew to include those who lived at the Cloister, alumni of the society, and honorary members. In 1888, Book and Snake built Cloister Hall, a combined chapter house and dormitory at 1 Hillhouse Avenue, at Grove Street.

Like other landed Yale societies, Book and Snake built a meeting hall or &quot;tomb&quot; in 1901 that is only accessible to members and alumni. The tomb cost $81,000, including $10,000 for its lot. The society enlarged its dormitory in 1917. However, when Yale started its residential college system in 1933, Book and Snake sold Cloister Hall to the university. Book and Snake also converted to a senior society in 1933.

In 1987, Book and Snake alumni created the Arthur Greer Memorial Prize for Outstanding Scholarly Publication or Research at Yale to honor Arthur Greer, Yale class of 1926. Given to one or two junior faculty members annually, the Greer Award comes with funding for future research and is one of Yale&#x27;s highest honors.

In 1999, the Stone Trust Corporation&#x27;s assets totaled $2,474,165. In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked Book and Snake as the third wealthiest secret society at Yale, with $5,619,120 in assets. According to the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, the society &quot;has a party reputation, with a large number of athletes and fraternity and sorority members.&quot;

== Symbols and traditions ==
Book and Snake uses a mix of ancient and esoteric symbols with meanings known only to its members. Its Tomb is said to be &quot;the perpetual attempt of establishing an official perfect order on earth, a sort of platonic reflection of heavenly secret societies.&quot;

In the Sigma Delta Chi era, the group&#x27;s symbol was a jawless skull that was chained to a cross. The Book and Snake&#x27;s original badge was an open book displaying the Greek letters ΣΔΧ surrounded by a coiled serpent. It was worn on the member&#x27;s tie. The modern version of this pin is an open book with an ouroboros on top, and no Greek letters. It is made of gold and is in size.

Each member of Book and Snake has a pewter or glass tankard that hangs on a hook in the Tomb&#x27;s dining room, ready for whenever they return. When a member dies, their tankard is broken or pierced through its bottom.

== Buildings ==
The Book and Snake Tomb is at the corner of Grove Street and High Street in New Haven, adjacent to the Yale Law School and the Beinecke Plaza. The Tomb was deliberately sited with its back to campus and faces across the street to the Egyptian-revival gates of the Grove Street Cemetery. The Tomb was designed in Greek Ionic style by Louis R. Metcalfe and completed in 1901. It is supposed to be the finest replica of a Greek temple in the United States. 

The windowless Tomb is built of solid white Vermont marble and has a roof of large marble tiles. It is long, wide, and feet high, including two stories and a gable. Its four Ionic pillars, carved from marble, support a triangle-shaped pediment across its front. Its bronze (originally wooden) front door is modeled after the Erechtheion Temple on the Acropolis in Athens. 

The Tomb&#x27;s alcove was built using steel–the first use of steel for a residence in the United States. Another of Metcalfe&#x27;s innovations was using pipes to take the smoke from the Tomb&#x27;s furnace to the chimney of a nearby commons building. The iron fence that surrounds the property features wrought-iron snakes or caduceus around posts shaped like flaming torches. In 2021, the society added the sculpture &quot;Aspire by&quot; Archie Held to its grounds.

Previously, Book and Snake owned a chapter house and dormitory at Sheffield Scientific School known as the Cloister or Cloister Hall. H. Edwards Ficken designed the ornate brownstone Cloister which was completed in 1888. At the time, it was considered &quot;one of the most picturesque buildings on the Yale campus.&quot; The society added a matching rear addition in 1915. Today, the building is called Warner House and is used for the Yale University graduate school and the Yale College Deans offices. A plaque honoring the society is on the first floor of the building.

<doc id="1166759" wikidata="Q1232962" url="?curid=1166759" title="Peromyscus">
<text>Peromyscus is a genus of rodents. They are commonly referred to as deer mice or deermice, not to be confused with the chevrotain or &quot;mouse deer&quot;. They are New World mice only distantly related to the common house and laboratory mouse, &quot;Mus musculus&quot;. From this relative, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; species are distinguished by relatively larger eyes, and also often two-tone coloring, with darker colors over the dorsum (back), and white abdominal and limb hair-coloring. In reference to the coloring, the word &quot;Peromyscus&quot; comes from Greek words meaning &quot;booted mouse&quot;. They are also accomplished jumpers and runners by comparison to house mice, and their common name of &quot;deer mouse&quot; (coined in 1833) is in reference to this agility.

The most common species of deer mice in the continental United States are two closely related species, &quot;P. maniculatus&quot; and &quot;P. leucopus&quot;. In the United States, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; is the most populous mammalian genus overall, and has become notorious in the western United States as a carrier of hantaviruses.

== Reservoir of human disease ==

=== Hantavirus ===
The deer mouse came to the attention of the public when it was discovered to be the primary reservoir species for Sin Nombre hantavirus.

=== Lyme disease ===
A recent study in British Columbia of 218 deer mice showed 30% (66) were seropositive for &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, the agent of Lyme disease.

=== Other diseases ===
Ehrlichiosis and babesiosis are also carried by the deer mouse.

== Use as a laboratory animal ==
While wild populations are sometimes studied, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; species are also easy to breed and keep in captivity, although they are more energetic and difficult to handle than the relatively more tame &quot;M. musculus&quot;. For certain studies, they are also favored over the laboratory mouse (&quot;M. musculus&quot;) and the laboratory rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;). Apart from their importance in studying infectious diseases, &quot;Peromyscus&quot; species are useful for studying phylogeography, speciation, chromosomes, genetics, ecology, population genetics, conservation and evolution in general. They are also useful for researching repetitive-movement disorders. Their use in aging research is because &quot;Peromyscus&quot; spp., despite being of similar size to the standard laboratory mouse, have maximum lifespans of 5–7 years, compared to the 3-year maximum lifespan of &quot;ad libitum&quot;-fed laboratory strains or wild-caught &quot;M. musculus&quot;.

The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center at the University of South Carolina was established by Professor Wallace Dawson in 1985 to raise animals of the peromyscine species for research and educational use. This institute maintains populations of several different species (including &quot;Peromyscus californicus&quot;, &quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;, &quot;Peromyscus melanophrys&quot;, &quot;Peromyscus eremicus&quot;, and &quot;Peromyscus aztecus&quot;). A variety of mutations affecting their behavior, biochemistry, and the color of their coats is exhibited in these genetic lines.

<text>The 2004 MLS Expansion Draft was held on November 19, 2004 and consisted of 10 rounds. The two new teams, Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake, drafted players from the other 10 Major League Soccer teams.

Existing MLS teams were allowed to protect 12 players on their senior roster, and players on the developmental roster were exempt from the draft. Teams were allowed to leave no more than one Senior International player unprotected. After each player was selected, his team was allowed to remove one exposed player from their list. Teams were not able to lose more than three players.

<text>Castelo Branco is the southern &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) on the island Faial, in the Azores; part of the municipality of Horta. This agricultural community is primarily known for the location of the Central Group&#x27;s first airport, Horta Airport. The population in 2011 was 1,309, in an area of 23.91 km². It contains the localities Canada da Santa Catarina, Cancela, Cerrado Grande, Farrobim do Norte, Grota do Meio, Jogo, Lombega, Pedreiras, Ribeira Grande and Ribeirinha.

==History==

The first record of the region referred to its old church, dated 30 July 1568; the church became integrated into the diocese in 1643. 

On 10 July 1514, on the orders of King Manuel I the appropriate religious equipment was installed at this primitive church, which was then composed of three naves, and built over 5 columns. Father Gaspar Frutuoso would later note that the church was one of a succession of churches to be formally built in each of the parishes on the island (following those of Horta, Feteira and Flamengos).

Until 1580, a convent existed in the parish, but, owing to the numerous pirate and privateer attacks, the nuns moved their order to Horta, to the Convent of São João Baptista. In 1767, the primitive church was replaced by the existing sanctuary to the adoration of Santa Catarina de Alexandria.

Diogo das Chagas acknowledges that 1,042 inhabitants in 245 residences lived within the borders of Castelo Branco.

The parish was also one of the many parishes depopulated by the 1957 eruption of the Capelinhos volcano, off the coast of Capelo. It contributed to immigration into Europe and North America during the middle of the 20th century, although recently there has been a subtle growth in demographics.

In December 2002, Horta Airport, which is located in the parish, was given its international designation. It was original inaugurated on August 24, 1971 by then-President of the Republic, Américo Tomás. The first direct flights began on July 5, 1985, between Lisbon and Horta on TAP Air Portugal.

==Geography==

Generally, this parish is a zone of pastureland extending from the ocean-front parcels to hillier forests around the Caldeira Volcano. The port at Castelo Branco, the old commercial fishing port, has been transformed into a swimming zone. The principal water courses in this region are: Ribeira de Santa Catarina, Ribeira Grande and Ribeira da Lombega

The name &quot;Castelo Branco&quot; was derived from the location of a white rock dike located at the edge of the parish and connected by a thin rock isthmus, like a medieval &quot;white castle&quot;. This Morro de Castelo Branco is a 10,000-year-old rock formation, and a protected area due to the number of bird species that use it as a rookery. The Gruta dos Anelares is located near this area.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the principal activity in the parish, due to its fertile soils, producing a wide variety of grains and vegetables (such as wheat, rye, barley and pumpkins). Sugar cane, flax seed, and tea have all contributed to the economy of the parish, even cultivating tobacco until recently. Over the centuries, these activities have also included herding and the dairy industry, as well as ancillary services associated with these activities, including cheese and butter production associated with the islands&#x27; base industry. Although local production was common, these industries were subsistence, while high-volume production was handled by the islands&#x27; remaining export companies, such as CALF &quot;Cooperativa Agrícola dos Lactícinios do Faial&quot; and Martins &amp; Rebello. At the beginning of 2012, two local entrepreneurs established the &quot;Queijaria O Morro&quot; that began to produce a local artesnal &quot;fresh&quot; cheese.

The fishery also adds to the parish&#x27;s economy, at one time a principal center of whaling and now primarily commercial fishing. It is also common that most involved in these primary industries are also involved in other activities.

In addition to a commercial bakery, the industrial zone of Lombega is the center of the aluminum industry.

Tourism in the region has grown in importance with the development of the International Airport.

==Culture==
Local handicrafts are an important tradition in the region. For example, a collection of miniature wooden agricultural implements created by António Duarte, are on display by the author in Canada de Santa Catarina. Each piece is a detailed miniature, with a lot of attention to detail. Similarly, other artists, such as José Rosa who work in tin, the painter Lurdes Andrade or the fine embroidery of Isaura Rodrigues are all examples of the traditional handicrafts produced in this parish.

The Sociedade Filarmónica Euterpe de Castelo Branco (a band), founded on April 12, 1912 is the pride of the community, along with its folklore group. In sports, the Futebol Clube de Castelo Branco (founded in 1917) has been active in regional football, challenging other groups in the Horta series.

In addition to the parish&#x27;s feast day in honor of its patron saint (Santa Catarina de Alexandria), falling on November 25, the community also celebrates other religious events. The festival of Saint Peter (in June), which has become an important event in the religious calendar, and Our Lady of Lourdes (on August 15).

<doc id="1166768" wikidata="Q1997707" url="?curid=1166768" title="Capelo">
<text>Capelo is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Horta on the island of Faial in the Azorean archipelago. The population in 2011 was 486, in an area of 26.64 km2. Capelo may be considered the westernmost settlement of Eurasia, if Fajã Grande, on Flores Island, is considered part of North America, for it sits on the North American Plate.

== History ==
The village was elevated to civil parish in 1600, when it was de-annexed from the neighbouring parish of Praia do Norte. Friar Diogo das Chagas, in 1643, noted that the parish had about 160 inhabitants, and approximately 44 residences. At its largest, the population reached 1,400 inhabitants.

The town was practically destroyed in 1672 and 1673 during the volcanic eruption of Cabeço de Fogo (the name of the central volcano on the island of Faial). During this eruption, volcanic ash and pyroclastic projectiles rained down on the community, destroying homes and sterilizing agricultural lands in Capelo and Praia do Norte. Ironically, between 1673 and 1845, Praia do Norte was integrated into the civil parish of Capelo.

The Church of the Santissima Trinidade (&quot;Church of the Holy Trinity&quot;) in Capelo, was ordered constructed by the Captain-major, Jorge Goulart Pimental, to replace the parochial church, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Esperança (&quot;Our Lady of Hope&quot;), which was destroyed during the 1672 volcanic eruption. A chapel to &quot;Nossa Senhora da Esperança&quot; was later constructed near the old church (which has since disappeared from the landscape).

The chapel of Varadouro was founded in 1720, by Father Manuel Pereira Cardoso, to the invocation of &quot;Nossa Senhora do Carmo&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Mount Carmel&quot;). Later, in his 1725 last testament, Father Cardoso requested that his inheritors celebrate a mass in perpetuity to the name &quot;Nossa Senhora do Carmo, the Holy Sacrament, and Santo António&quot;, on every first Sunday of October. The spa at Varadouro was constructed and inaugurated on 1 August 1954 by architect Read Teixeira.

== Geography ==

===Physical geography===
Mountainous volcanic craters cover the majority of the parish (being the location of the most recent volcanic eruption in the Azores). The parish has several facets: an area of volcanic craters that extends from the islands caldera, inland pasturelands used to support the agricultural/dairy industry, and a coastal zone of cottages and oceanfront pools. Linking these areas is the ubiquitous Regional Road E.R. 1-1ª that connects the communities on the island with Horta in the southeast corner.

The parish is located on layers of volcanic materials referred to as the Capelo Volcanic Complex. It is a line of volcanic escoria cones of fissural nature lying on a west-northwest-east-southeast orientation consisting of basaltic volcanism of low explosivity. The peninsula shows varying volcanic shapes and products resulting from surtseyan, Hawaiian and strombolian phases of volcanism. It is area of young rock (less than 10.000 years), overlying the older pyroclasts of the Caldeira Formation, and includes two historical eruptions (the 1672 Cabeço do Fogo and 1957 Capelinhos eruptions). This fractural zone is defined by the Capelo Fault, a fracture system of cones and craters displaying right lateral echelon geometry, which extends to Capelinhos volcano in the western tip of Faial. In this particular area, Capelo Fault is expressed by tens of sub-vertical fractures, concentrated in a 250 meter wide zone, cutting through the pyroclastic sequence of a surtseyan cone exposed in a paleo-sea cliff east of Capelinhos volcano. An example of these fractures can be found on the surface of the Capelinhos volcano; a warm vent on its eastern flank belies the active nature of this volcanism.

==== Ecoregions/Protected areas ====
The parish is crossed by several pedestrian hiking trails connecting the volcanic cones along the Capelo Volcanic Complex: Cabeço do Fogo, Cabeço Verde and Cabeço do Canto, as well as interesting geological sites such as Fonte dos Namorados. Capelo is also known for its micro-climate, which has allowed the cultivation of grapes and small wine production. The areas along Canada das Adegas (in Norte Pequeno) and Varadouro are characteristic of these private holdings and &quot;adegas&quot;.
In addition, two major protected areas fall within the frontiers of the parish:
* Área Protegida para a Gestão de Habitats ou Espécies dos Capelinhos, Costa Noroeste e Varadouro () - the protected area encompasses many of the extinct cones of &quot;Cabeço Verde&quot;, &quot;Cabeço da Fonte&quot;, &quot;Caldeirão&quot;, &quot;Cabeço do Canto&quot; and &quot;Caldeirinhas&quot; along the Capelo cape until &quot;Cabeço do Goularte&quot;, flanking of the central caldera. The protected area, designated for the protection of habitats and species includes pre-existing environments and the nascent ecosystems of the volcanic structures of Capelo, as well as the fragile ecoregion created by the Capelinhos eruption;
* Área Protegida de Gestão de Recursos dos Capelinhos, includes primarily the impact area of the Capelinhos eruption that extends from the Estrada Regional E.R.1-1ª to the &quot;Costa do Nau&quot; coast and Capelinhos volcano. This area, primarily identifiable by the barren moonscape and iconic lighthouse were designated for protection and management, and conserves the post-eruption landscape, interdicting reconstruction of homes lost during the event. In addition to the &quot;Costa do Nau&quot;, the protected area extends to the coast and ocean territory off the coast, surround the base of the volcano;
* Área Protegida para a Gestão de Habitats ou Espécies Varadouro–Castelo Branco () - this protected area includes the escarpment face of the southern coast, extending from Varadouro to the Morro de Castelo Branco, which are nesting grounds for migratory and marine bird species;
Further, and also included in the Capelinhos-Nordoeste-Varadouro region is the Parque Florestal do Capelo (), a region that extends from the central Capelos cape to the coast between Biscoitos and Varadouro used as leisure/recreative forest park.

The Geographer Christophe Neff working since 1999 on environmental changes and vegetation dynamics and plant distribution in the different landscapes of the Capelo area, wrote recently in his blog, - that Capelo has considerably changed in the last twenty years, - more tourism, more secondary houses, and more vineyards are now part of the landscape of Capelo. In the same text he remarked, that in 1999 Capelo was a very fare remote area, the End of the world, “Fim do Mundo”, the same name as a bar, that was situated, in Norte Pequeno in the North of Capelo.

===Climate===
Capelo has a humid subtropical climate at low altitudes and a wetter oceanic climate at higher altitudes. 
===Human geography===
In addition to the village of Capelo, at the intersection of the E.R.1-1ª and E.R.3-2ª, the parish includes the localities of Areeiro, Biscoitos, Canto, Cimo da Ribeira, Cruzeiro, Norte Pequeno, Ribeira do Cabo, Rua do Canto, Rua da Igreja and Varadouro.

==Economy==
The economy in this region is primarily agriculture-related, with dairy-oriented activities dominating. Meanwhile, owing to the numerous natural monuments in the region (the aforementioned Capelinhos volcano and protected areas), the region regularly sees eco-tourist activities throughout the year, with rural tourism, pedestrian trails and other leisure activities occurring in the areas of Capelo and Varadouro.

The parish&#x27;s southern coast is considered the &quot;spa region&quot; of the island, dominated by a large bay and the black rock cliffs of Varadouro and the Mouro volcanic plug. Discovered in 1889, the warm waters at Varadouro were considered, at the time, one of the best medicinal treatments in the country for rheumatism and skin diseases; its hypersaline waters whose temperatures average , attracted &quot;beachgoers&quot; who travelled to the ocean-carved pools for refreshment during the Gilded Age, while partaking of the thermal waters at the spa.

Since this period, the use of the thermal waters has been intermittent, during phases of proactive local governments; around the late 20th century the buildings were already in ruins. Plans to economically rejuvenate the area were concentrated on reconstructing the buildings, as a way to attract new visitors. But, in November 2007, these small plans were suspended in order to redevelop the site into a Hotel-Spa facility. These plans stagnated until 2009 when, along with INOVA, the regional government proposed a new project to revitalize the thermal-spa potentiality of the Azores (called TERMAZ), which projected the reconstruction of the existing Varadouro spa buildings: a project that was stalled by 2011. Amid opposition declarations requesting a timeline for their reconstruction, by 2011, the Regional Government indicated their intention to expropriate lands necessary to &quot;re-qualify and reactivate&quot; the Thermae of Varadouro (and suggesting that only 10% had not been acquired until this point).

Part of the Protected Landscape of the Central Zone (), the structure is included within the &quot;Trail of the 10 Volcanoes&quot; (), which was also improved during the requalification of the areas;
* Lighthouse of Ponta dos Capelinhos () and &quot;Interpretative Centre of the Capelinhos Volcano&quot; (), the 19th century lighthouse that took half a century to construct, but was destroyed in less than a year during the Capelinhos volcanic eruption (1957–58);
* Lighthouse of Vale Formoso (), a 20th-century modernist lighthouse recognizable for its simplistic lines, comparable to the lighthouse in the Formigas; 
* Thermal Spa of Varadouro ()

===Festivities===
In addition to the festivals associated with the Holy Spirit (which occur several weeks following Easter), the parish is the center of the &quot;Festas do Varadouro&quot;. This religious celebration is associated with the testamente of Father Cardoso who requested his heirs celebrate a mass in his Chapel of Varadouro in the name of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (Our Lady of Carmo). The celebration occurs on the first Sunday in October.

===Tourism===
Tourism in this parish is associated primarily with the main sites: Capelinhos and Varadouro. The re-qualification of the primary roadways within the past few years has been a process of improving and developing rural, eco- and geo-tourism. Similarly, with the emphasis on improving tourism in the Varadouro region, the natural rock pools have been improved and thermal spa in planning for remodeling.

<text>Cedros is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the northern part of the municipality of Horta on the island of Faial in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 907, in an area of . The northernmost parish on the island, it is located northwest of Horta and is linked via the &quot;Estrada Regional E.R. 1-1ª&quot; roadway to the rest of the island. The tree-covered hills and pasture-lands cover the interior, and hedged farmlands extend to the Atlantic coastline cliffs, a natural plateau above the sea, that was settled by early Flemish and Spanish colonists in the late part of the 15th century. Primarily an agricultural community, the population is comparable in size to other parishes on the island, though this has decreased by half since the 1950s (when there were approximately 2000 inhabitants). Today, it remains an agricultural centre of the island of Faial, anchored by the &quot;Cooperativa Agrícola dos Lactícinios do Faial&quot;, one of the primary rural industries on the island, responsible for sales of milk, cheese and butter.

==History==

The history of the settlement of Cedros was tied to the failure of the Flemish nobleman Josse van Huerter&#x27;s first expedition in 1466 to the island. Abandoned by Huerter, some members of his failed expedition were joined by settlers from Terceira and Spain whom explored and settled along the northern coast of Faial.

The origin of the name Cedros comes from the local cedars (the Cedros-das-Ilhas or Cedros-do-Mato) found in the pasture-lands and forests of the area (). In addition to the cedars, along the numerous river-valleys (especially Ribeira Funda, Ribeira Pinheiro and Ribeira Sousa) they encountered species of Pine, Juniper, flowering plants (such as the family &quot;Adoxaceae&quot;), laurel (), Buckthorn (), and Ginger Lily (), as well as other broad-leaf plants. Close access to potable water allowed the settlers to develop small tracts of land, build homes of ubiquitous volcanic rock and cultivate a subsistence lifestyle: a few animals (cows, lambs or goats) and a small vegetable garden. The introduction of wheat allowed the development of a small local export industry.

Between 1466 and 1467, Josse van Huerter returned to the island, through the patronage from the Duke of Burgundy. After a failed settlement on the Lomba dos Frades, he established the nucleus of what would become Horta and beginning the first Captaincy of the island. Some of the more adventurous settlers, primarily from the island of Terceira, followed the trails north to the area now known as Santa Bárbara (Praça). These new settlers were more affluent then the original settlers (some even noblemen), who constructed larger, more ornate homes: such as the Castelo da Rocha Negra (or &quot;Casa dos Lacerdas dos Cedros&quot;), a three-floor house with molded cornices, verandas, and corbels in black volcanic rock.

Father Gaspar Frutuoso, the celebrated Portuguese historian, priest and humanist, best known for his six-part tome Saudades da Terra that documented the genealogy and history of the Azores archipelago, recounted the conflicts, histories and personalities of the region. While, the development of the stain/woad industry and conflict between impresarios Van Huerter and Wilhelm van der Hagen were important events on the island, it was the Fleming Hern Jannequim that created controversies in Cedros. Also known as Arnequim, he caused his own problems by confronting and expelling the Magistrate-of-Justice and then threatening the Captain-General with death, when they prepared to capture him. The conflict was eventually resolved by the King who was bemused by his audacity. Regardless, Flemish influence and importance had slowly begun to decline on the island, and Spanish settlers began to venture to this region.

The village was formally founded in 1594: this date is conjecture, based on evidence found during the reconstruction of the parochial Church of Santa Bárbara following a fire that occurred in November 1971. The church was originally constructed during the Iberian Union, in grand dimensions and in a style different from other churches on Faial (including four bells in the tower). The northern bell was large, and many locals reflected that it could be heard from as far as the base of the island&#x27;s caldera. A current myth, perpetuated by older residents, involves the disappearance of the bells which, some say, were mysteriously removed and installed at the Sé Cathedral of Angra do Heroísmo, Terceira. An anonymous letter was also sent at one time stating that the bells were buried beside the church, although the bells were never found. Another interesting holdover of the Iberian Union was the enormous silver-plated oil lamp that hung within the church (the only other lamp of similar dimensions was hung in Spain).

By 1643, Friar Diogo das Chagas claimed the parish was inhabited by 2126 people. In 1672, a violent eruption caused an important exodus to Brasil. Also, the end of the Iberian Union, resulted in the expulsion of most of the Spanish living in the parish (which included Salão at the time). Similarly, an epidemic between 1717 and 1718 caused the deaths of many. Yet, the growth of the Carmelite, Jesuit and Franciscan religious orders at about the same time resulted in the growth of the faith community on Faial.

===Legend of the Moorish Crown of Cedros===
A legend that dates back to the Philippine dynasty, recalls the time after the fall of Terceira, when the islands of the Azores were occupied by forces of Philip II of Spain. Even before this time the Azores had always been cursed by pirates and privateers, who would attack by surprise during foggy days, under the cover of night or the light of day. They assaulted, robbed and sacked many of the communities along the coast, sometimes conscripting men to work as slaves. As legend tells, a pirate galleon, commanded by a Moorish King attacked the island of Faial, but since the ship was spotted in time, the local population was given time to prepare. The pirates encountered stiff resistance and were forced to retreat without pillaging the homes along the northern coast.

During the course of the retreat, the Moorish King lost his crown (made of silver and adorned with leaf in sparkling metal), after leaving it along a hedge-row while battling the defenders. Along the coast, the King remembered he had left his crown behind, and not wanting to lose his symbol of power, he resolved to return to the island. But, not wanting to be recognized as pirates they returned as local mariners. Not discovering the lost crown where he had left it, the group began to ask around but found no clues to its location. The local people began to get suspicious, and they were obliged to abandon their search and returned to their lands in North Africa, from which they did not return.

Meanwhile, the crown was discovered by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing the value of the object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later re-solder it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the Divine Holy Spirit. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and rich object, a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the &quot;mordomo&quot; of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still visible around the crown. It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.

==Geography==

Cedros is one of the largest parishes on the island of Faial. It is bordered on the east by Salão and west by Praia do Norte and extends from the coast to the center of the island (and the Caldeira Volcano). Apart from the rich pasture-lands and hedged-fields in Alto do Inverno, Alto do Rigo or Cabeça da Vaca, the coastal cliffs are approximately above sea level (the highest coastal altitude in this parish being near Ribeira Funda). The region is intersected by several rivers and valley creeks including &quot;Ribeira Funda&quot; (&quot;the Deep Ravine&quot;), &quot;Ribeira Pinheiro&quot; (&quot;Pine Ravine&quot;) and &quot;Ribeira Sousa&quot; (&quot;Sousa Ravine&quot;, named after one of the original settlers), which are usually dry throughout most of the year.

The population is concentrated along the Regional E.R. 1-1a Roadway that circles the island. Praça (&quot;village square&quot;) is the more urbanized centre of parish, although most places are identified by the smaller neighbourhoods, or &quot;localities&quot; (), where settlements developed, including Porto de Eira, Cabeço, Cascalho, Covões and Ribeira Funda. Uphill, a secondary road (linked to the E.R. 1-1ª by the &quot;Canada da Sousa&quot;, &quot;Rua de Igreja&quot; and &quot;Canada do Vale&quot;) connects the &quot;localities&quot; of Canto, Janalves and Miragaia (colloquially known as the &quot;Rua de Cima&quot;). Each of these places have their own distinctions, and some include their own local pubs, community markets () or religious sanctuaries (there are four &quot;imperios&quot; (temples to the Holy Spirit) in Cedros.

==Economy==

The main economy in this area is agriculture. The soil of the parish is fertile allowing the cultivation of various legumes and grains. Wheat, corn, beans, potatoes and sweet potatoes have been agricultural staples in the region over the decades.

Dairy production has also had an important role in the economy since this northern coast was populated, but it only became an organized industry in the early 1920s. About this time an enterprising couple (Professor Constantino Magno do Amaral and D. Teresa) began a small factory in the area of &quot;Rua da Igreja&quot;, eventually occupying the building currently &quot;occupied&quot; by Ethnographic Museum (Nulceu Etnográfico dos Cedros) across from the main church. Later, a second firm, Castro, Merrinho &amp; Xavier began operating in Cascalho, along &quot;Canada do Inês&quot;. José Freitas also developed a small business in &quot;Canto da Gatinha&quot;, a group of investors started the União dos Lavradores that operated along the regional road, and the União Industrial Cedrenses (locally referred to as &quot;fábrica do Marujo&quot;) was also formed in Praça (long after Professor Amaral&#x27;s operation had ceased). By 1941 many of these operations had been bought or failed and the remaining businesses, Castro, Merrinho &amp; Xavier and União Industrial, were being squeezed by low milk prices. It was then that a group of enterprising farmers, under the counsel of Professor José da Rosa Aica, banded together to form what would eventually be known as the cooperative CALF: the Cooperativa Agrícola dos Lactícinios do Faial. The idea of a cooperative spread quickly in the north of the island through the parishes, and it quickly became the largest enterprise on the island. Castro, Merrinho &amp; Xavier was later purchased by a group from Lisbon to form Lacto Açoreana, it lasted briefly, eventually coming under the control of a Horta businessman and failing. The União Industrial Cedrense was purchased by Martins &amp; Rebello, then the largest milk processor in Portugal, and moved to Cascalho (not too far from the Cooperativo) to occupy the old Castro, Merrinho &amp; Xavier buildings. By 2004, the Cooperative had survived the competition, and restructured its operations to compete in the European market, expanding physically to handle the production. It is the principal business located in Cascalho, and responsible for the production and packaging of cheese and butter under the Ilha Azul label. In Cedros, Martins &amp; Rebello did not survive the century. As part of its customer-driven re-inorientation, the factory once-again reintroduced its store-front cheese shop (abandoned during the late 20th century), and experimented with new variants for restaurants, such as their Moledo table cheese.

Tourism has become the second local industry in the region. &quot;Rural Tourism&quot;, highlighted by the Nucleo Etnográfico dos Cedros and several renovated &quot;bed and breakfast&quot;-like cottages, attract visitors to this northern coast village. The museum once included several examples of antique farm implements, equipment and tools used in daily life, as well as some pictures associated with the village and life in 19th-20th centuries. Currently, the museum is in disuse, and most of the exhibits have been placed &quot;in storage&quot;.

The area is served by several small shops, including bakery and pastry shop, hair-dressers, mechanical shops, car dealerships, restaurants (such as the &quot;Esconderijo&quot;), and a supermarket (&quot;Aldina Supermercado/Restaurante&quot;) open in 2012, that serves both the local market of Cascalho and nuclear settlements of Cedros, as well as other parishes surrounding the civil parish. The history of the restaurant O Esconderijo has been described recently by the geographer &amp; blogger Christophe Neff in his blog, in the chapter « Nick&#x27;s Hideway – O Esconderijo » in one of his last posts, retrieving 20 years of geographical research in the Island of Faial.

<doc id="1166776" wikidata="Q248637" url="?curid=1166776" title="Flying Tiger Line">
<text>Flying Tiger Line, also known as Flying Tigers, was the first scheduled cargo airline in the United States and a military charter operator during the Cold War era for both cargo and personnel (the latter with leased aircraft). The airline was bought by Federal Express in 1989.

== History ==
=== Early years===
The airline was named after the Flying Tigers fighter unit of World War II, officially the 1st American Volunteer Group. After returning to the United States in 1945, ten former AVG pilots led by Robert William Prescott established the Flying Tiger Line on 24 June 1945 under the name National Skyway Freight using a small fleet of 14 Budd Conestoga freighters purchased as war surplus from the United States Navy. The pilots and two ground crew provided half of the initial investment, with the balance coming from California oil tycoon Samuel B. Mosher. For the next four years, Flying Tiger Line carried air freight on contract throughout the U.S. and, as the airline expanded, carrying supplies to U.S. troops under Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the occupation of Japan.

In 1949, the Civil Aeronautics Board awarded Flying Tiger Line (along with Slick Airways) a scheduled cargo certificate for a transcontinental route from Los Angeles and San Francisco, California to Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly afterward, the company began chartering passenger aircraft for group travel as well; its Lockheed Super Constellation, Douglas DC-4 and DC-6 fleet comprised the largest trans-Atlantic charter operation through the 1950s.

During the Korean War, Flying Tiger aircraft were chartered to transport troops and supplies from the United States to Asia; Flying Tigers later received a cargo route award to Japan, China, and Southeast Asia. The airline also played a major role in the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line, flying equipment to remote outposts in northern Canada and Alaska.

Flying Tiger Line adopted the Canadair CL-44 swing-tail aircraft in 1961, becoming one of the first carriers in the world to offer aerial pallet shipping service.

===1960s-1970s: Jet age===

Flying Tiger Line began operating jet aircraft on September 27, 1965, when the first (as N322F) of four Boeing 707s was delivered. On 15 November that same year, a modified Flying Tigers Boeing 707-349C made the first ever aerial circumnavigation of the Earth via the poles, in 62 hours 27 minutes. The aircraft carried additional fuel in two additional tanks installed in the main cabin. The Boeing 707 remained in the fleet for only a few years and was replaced by the higher-payload Douglas DC-8, the largest civilian airliner until the Boeing 747 entered service. The first Douglas DC-8-63F, registered as N779FT, was delivered to the airline on June 26, 1968, and the other eighteen followed until 1972.

In 1974, the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 747. Flying Tigers then placed orders for brand-new Boeing 747-200F freighters designated the Boeing 747-249F, which at the time were among the heaviest commercial airplanes flying, weighing . These aircraft had the powerful &quot;Q&quot; (Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7Q) engines and heavy landing gear and could simultaneously carry both of fuel and of cargo loaded through both the nose door and the side door at the same time. Aircraft loaders had earlier refused to work at the extreme height necessary for loading freight on the upper deck, so the &quot;supernumerary area&quot; or &quot;hump&quot; was configured with 19 first class seats instead which were used to transport livestock handlers, charter agents and mechanics as well as dead-heading pilots and flight attendants.

===1980s: Later years and merger with Federal Express===

Tiger&#x27;s Ad Hoc Charter livestock flights provided airlift for exotic animals. Two examples were thoroughbred racehorses and show animals from Stansted, England to the Melbourne Cup, as well as breeding stock cattle (milk supply) to nations such as Japan and Thailand. They became known for carrying a number of unique cargoes, including Shamu the SeaWorld killer whale and the torch of the Statue of Liberty.

By the mid-1980s, Flying Tigers operated scheduled cargo service to six continents and served 58 countries. It surpassed Pan American World Airways in 1980 as the world&#x27;s largest air cargo carrier after acquiring its rival cargo airline Seaboard World Airlines on 1 October 1980. It also operated military contract services, most notably DC-8 routes between Travis Air Force Base, California and Japan in the 1970s, followed by weekly 747 passenger service between Clark Air Base, Philippines, and St. Louis, Missouri via Japan, Alaska, and Los Angeles during the 1980s. Covert flights for the military were not uncommon throughout the airline&#x27;s history, given its roots in Civil Air Transport (CAT), as with its sister airline Air America, originally owned by General Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers fighter squadron in Southeast Asia.

At its peak, the Tigers employed approximately 251 flight attendants and carried up to a record 594 passengers and crew on its MAC all-coach passenger flights. Approximately 998 pilots worked for the airline based throughout the US. Large crew bases were situated at Los Angeles, New York City and Lockbourne, Ohio (Rickenbacker International Airport). The Los Angeles headquarters operation included its own engine shop and jet maintenance business. Flying Tigers also made livestock carriers for airplanes, some comparable in external size and shape to the standard AMJ container used in the FedEx flight operations. They operated a recording company subsidiary, Happy Tiger Records, from 1969 to 1971.

Charter and scheduled passenger operations were flown by their subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, which was formed in January 1981, and ceased operations in 1983, when it was sold to Tower Air. The scheduled Boeing 747 passenger service route was New York City JFK Airport - Brussels - Tel Aviv operated several days a week.

After airline deregulation, stiff competition buffeted profits and, with some unsuccessful diversification attempts by parent Tiger International, the airline began sustaining losses in 1981. Then-CEO Stephen Wolf sold Flying Tigers to Federal Express in December 1988. On August 7, 1989, Federal Express merged Flying Tigers into its operations.

== Other ventures ==

Flying Tigers was a sponsor of the Benetton Formula One team for the 1986 season.

== Fleet ==
At the time of its sale to FedEx, Flying Tigers were operating the following aircraft:

*8 Boeing 747-100
*13 Boeing 747-200
*19 Boeing 727-100
*6 Douglas DC-8-73

==Accidents and incidents==
* On July 30, 1950, Curtiss C-46F N67960 crashed on takeoff from Denver due to unknown performance problems; both pilots and both passengers survived, but the aircraft was written off.
* On August 21, 1952, Curtiss C-46F N67983 made a wheels-up emergency landing in a field near Grand Island, Nebraska when the captain, conducting en-route flight training of the first officer, simulated a right-engine failure. The probable cause of the accident was poor judgment of the crew in trying to recover. The crew survived, the aircraft was substantially damaged.
* On January 7, 1953, Flight 841, Douglas DC-4 N86574, struck the base of Squak Mountain near Issaquah, Washington due to pilot error during an attempted instrument approach to Boeing Field, Seattle, killing all seven on board. The aircraft was being ferried from Burbank.
* On September 24, 1955, Flight 7413/23, Douglas DC-4 N90433, ditched in the Pacific between Honolulu and Wake Island after the crew mismanaged fuel transfers leading to power out on three engines, then mismanaged engine restarts. One crew member was trapped on board and died when the aircraft sank, the other four survived the crash but two died of injuries, exposure and shark attacks. Two were rescued. 
* On March 18, 1956, Curtiss C-46F N9995F crashed at Pelly Bay, Canada after the left wing struck terrain while on night-time VFR approach, both pilots and the passenger survived, but the aircraft was written off.

* On December 14, 1962, Flight 183, L-1049H Super Constellation N6913C, crashed on approach to Burbank, California from Chicago due to pilot incapacitation (suspected heart attack), killing all five on board and three on the ground.
* On December 24, 1964, Flight 282, L-1049H Super Constellation N6915C crashed shortly after departure from San Francisco on a flight to New York City after an unexplained course change, killing the three crew.
* On December 15, 1965, Flying Tiger Line Flight 914, L-1049H Super Constellation N6914C, struck California Peak at 13,000 ft after the pilot became disorientated in IFR conditions, killing the three crew.
* On March 21, 1966, Flying Tiger Line Flight 6303, a Canadair CL-44 (N453T), crashed on landing at NAS Norfolk due to pilot error; all six crew survived, but the aircraft was written off.
* On December 24, 1966, a Flying Tiger Line Canadair CL-44 (N228SW) crashed on landing near Da Nang, killing all four crew and 107 on the ground.
* On July 27, 1970, Flying Tiger Line Flight 45, a Douglas DC-8 (N785FT), crashed in the water off Naha Air Base, Okinawa, killing all four crew.
* On February 15, 1979, Flying Tiger Line Flight 74, a Boeing 747 (N804FT), was landing at O’Hare International Airport in heavy fog whilst Delta Airlines Flight 349, a Boeing 727, was crossing the active runway Flight 74 was landing on. The two aircraft narrowly avoided a ground collision when Flight 74 swerved into the grass beside the runway. No one was injured, and the aircraft was returned to service.
* On October 11, 1983, Flying Tiger Line Flight 9014, a Boeing 747 (N806FT), ran off the runway at Frankfurt International Airport after a cargo pallet broke loose; the three crew and three passengers survived; the aircraft was substantially damaged, but was repaired and returned to service.
* On October 25, 1983, Flying Tiger Line Flight 2468, a Douglas DC-8 (N797FT), ran off the runway at NAS Norfolk due to crew and ATC errors; all five on board survived; the aircraft was substantially damaged but was repaired and returned to service.
* August 6, 1986 – A Flying Tigers aircraft, bound for Columbus Rickenbacker International Airport. (LCK), mistakenly lands at Boltan Field.
* On February 19, 1989, Flying Tiger Line Flight 66 crashed near Kuala Lumpur due to crew and ATC errors, killing all four crew.

<doc id="1166782" wikidata="Q1456044" url="?curid=1166782" title="Embryonic diapause">
<text>Embryonic diapause (delayed implantation in mammals) is a reproductive strategy used by a number of animal species across different biological classes. In more than 130 types of mammals where this takes place, the process occurs at the blastocyst stage of embryonic development, and is characterized by a dramatic reduction or complete cessation of mitotic activity, arresting most often in the G0 or G1 phase of division.

In placental embryonic diapause, the blastocyst does not immediately implant in the uterus after sexual reproduction has resulted in the zygote, but rather remains in this non-dividing state of dormancy until conditions allow for attachment to the uterine wall to proceed as normal. As a result, the normal gestation period is extended for a species-specific time.

Diapause provides a survival advantage to offspring, because birth or emergence of young can be timed to coincide with the most hospitable conditions, regardless of when mating occurs or length of gestation; any such gain in survival rates of progeny confers an evolutionary advantage.

==Evolutionary significance==
Organisms which undergo embryonic diapause are able to synchronize the birth of offspring to the most favorable conditions for reproductive success, irrespective of when mating took place. Many different factors can induce embryonic diapause, such as the time of year, temperature, lactation and supply of food.

Embryonic diapause is a relatively widespread phenomenon outside of mammals, with known occurrence in the reproductive cycles of many insects, nematodes, fish, and other non-mammalian vertebrates. It has been observed in approximately 130 mammalian species, which is less than two percent of all species of mammals. These include certain pinnipeds, rodents, bears, armadillos, mustelids (e.g. weasels and badgers), and marsupials (e.g. kangaroos). Some groups only have one species that undergoes embryonic diapause, such as the roe deer in the order Artiodactyla.

Experimental induction of embryonic discontinuous development within species which do not spontaneously undergo embryonic diapause in nature has been achieved; reversible developmental arrest was successfully demonstrated. This may be evidence for the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon, with latent capacity for diapause potentially present in a much wider segment of species than known to occur naturally.

== General mechanism ==
All multicellular organisms, from their conception, begin as a small number of cells and only grow and develop as those cells divide. In organisms which are capable of embryonic diapause, in non-ideal reproductive conditions, there is a cessation of cellular division which prevents the embryo from growing and maturing, delaying the maturation of the embryo until conditions are ideal enough to promote the survival of the offspring, and in some cases, the mother.

Regulation of the cell cycle as it relates to embryonic diapause has been linked to the &quot;dacapo&quot; gene in the fruit fly, responsible for inhibiting the formation of cyclin E-cdk2 complexes necessary for DNA synthesis. There is also evidence pointing to the upregulation of B cell translocation gene 1 (Btg1) in the mouse embryo during diapause, another known regulator of the cell cycle, responsible for inhibiting transition from G0/G1. Other studies have demonstrated, inversely, the lack of involvement of more common regulators of the cell cycle such as p53 within the placental model of embryonic diapause. While much of the molecular regulation involved in activating dormant blastocysts has been characterized, little widely applicable characterization is available regarding entry into diapause, and the conditions which enable a blastocyst to remain dormant. Once the embryo exits diapause arrest and resumes regular development, no adverse effects are observed.

Specifically within placental embryonic diapause, this cessation is led by the intentional failure of the blastocyst to implant in the uterine wall, which is an essential component in developmental progression in these species. Hormones relating to the failed implantation also contribute to the embryonic arrest.

== Types ==
There are two distinct forms of embryonic diapause, characterized by different conditions of onset. Facultative diapause occurs in response to certain environmental or metabolic stressors, such as drastic changes in temperature, feeding, or lactation. Obligate diapause occurs regularly in the reproductive cycle of the affected species, and is often associated with seasonal changes and photo-period.

=== Facultative diapause ===
Facultative diapause is regulated by several factors, including the maternal environment and ovarian competency, the pituitary gland, and metabolic stress and lactation.

With regards to the many other regulators of this form of diapause, in placental mammals, facultative diapause is most often the result of fertilization shortly following the birth of a previous litter, The consequential pups suckling during lactation promotes prolactin to be released. This in turn reduces progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum in a pregnant female. The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine organ that is formed from the leftover cells from the ovarian follicle in the ovary, once it has released a mature ovum. The main function of the corpus luteum is to secrete progesterone during pregnancy in order to maintain the uterine environment needed. Prolactin acting on the corpus luteum causes the progesterone level to be below optimal concentration and therefore induces embryonic facultative diapause.

Each species that undergoes facultative diapause tends to have a specific developmental stage, that is genetically determined, in which this process is initiated. This form of diapause is most well studied in rodents and marsupials but has been identified in many other species, including non-mammals. It is not clear how well the mechanisms studied for the onset, maintenance and release from facultative diapause in the rodent model apply to these other species.

===Obligate diapause ===
Obligate (adj: by necessity) diapause (a.k.a. seasonal delayed implantation) is a mechanism ensuring the birth of offspring is timed during optimal environmental conditions, to ensure maximal survival. The proposed mechanism is to separate conception and parturition (birth) so that each can occur at the most favourable time of year.

Obligate diapause is activated and deactivated by changes to the number of daylight hours within a day (photoperiod) and hence, occurs within specific seasons. While obligate diapause occurs in a variety of species in different groups, there are significant variations in diapause length. Western spotted skunks (&quot;Spilogale gracilis&quot;) have a diapause of around 200 days while American minks (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;) only have a diapause of around fourteen days.

Similarly to facultative diapause, a series of hormonal changes arrest the blastocyst development, prior to implantation, preventing continued growth of the embryo. However, in obligate diapause, the blastocyst shall enter into the dormant state in every reproductive season. This means every blastocyst a mother produces shall enter a period of diapause.

Close regulation of obligate diapause is essential for survival of the mother and offspring. Premature diapause can result in forgone growth and breeding opportunities and late diapause can result in death due to adverse conditions.

Prior to the vernal equinox, the photoperiod is less than 12 hours. This increases the production of melatonin in the pineal gland. Due to the inhibitory relationship between melatonin and prolactin, this increase in melatonin decreases prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. The decrease in prolactin consequently decreases progesterone production in the corpus luteum, preventing development of the blastocyst. This induces embryonic diapause.

After the vernal equinox, the photoperiod is greater than 12 hours. This decreases the production of melatonin in the pineal gland and, therefore, increases the prolactin and progesterone production in the pituitary gland and corpus luteum respectively.

The increase in prolactin induces expression of the gene Odc (ornithine decarboxylase). The Odc gene produces the ODC protein, a rate-limiting enzyme in the production of the polyamine, putrescine, within the uterine environment. The presence of putrescine may indicate a role in inducing the escape of the embryo from obligate diapause.

== Embryonic stem cells ==
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to allow for further understanding of the mechanisms controlling embryonic diapause. This is because the ESCs and diapausing blastocysts having very similar transcriptome profiles. ESCs are derived from the undifferentiated inner mass cells of blastocysts of an embryo – with the capability of continual proliferation in vitro. ESCs are mostly derived from mouse models, at the point where the ESCs are at optimal efficiency and are able to enter diapause.

Both diapausing blastocysts and ESCs have transcriptome profile similarities, including downregulation of metabolism, biosynthesis and gene expression pathways. These similarities allow for the potential to use ESCs as a cellular model to identify the molecular factors which regulate embryonic diapause.

<text>Edward O&#x27;Sullivan Lee OD (23 August 1941 – 6 October 2020), better known as Bunny &quot;Striker&quot; Lee, was a Jamaican record producer. He was known as a pioneer of the United Kingdom reggae market, licensing his productions to Trojan Records in the early 1970s, and later working with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and King Tubby.

==Early life ==
Bunny Lee was born on 23 August 1941 and grew up in the Greenwich Farm area of Kingston, where his father was a shoemaker.

==Career==
Lee began his career working as a record plugger for Duke Reid&#x27;s Treasure Isle label in 1962, later performing the same duties for Leslie Kong. He then moved on to work with Ken Lack, initially in an administrative role, before taking on engineering duties. Lee then moved into producing (i.e. financing) records himself, his first hit record coming with Roy Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Music Field&quot; on WIRL in 1967. Lee then set up his own &quot;Lee&#x27;s&quot; label, the first release being Lloyd Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Listen to the Beat&quot;. He produced further hits during 1967–68 by Lester Sterling and Stranger Cole, Derrick Morgan, Slim Smith and The Uniques (&quot;My Conversation&quot;), Pat Kelly, and The Sensations, establishing him as one of Jamaica&#x27;s top producers. Between 1969 and 1972 he produced classic hits including Slim Smith&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot;, Max Romeo&#x27;s &quot;Wet Dream&quot;, Delroy Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Better Must Come&quot;, Eric Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Oh Baby&quot;, and John Holt&#x27;s &quot;Stick By Me&quot;.

Lee was a pioneer of the United Kingdom reggae market, licensing his productions to the Palmer Brothers (Pama) and Trojan Records in the early 1970s.

The mid-1970s saw Lee work with his most successful singer, Johnny Clarke, as well as Owen Gray and Cornell Campbell, and along with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, he broke the dominance of Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid. This era also saw the emergence of the &quot;flying cymbal&quot; sound on Lee&#x27;s productions, developed by drummer Carlton &#x27;Santa&#x27; Davis, with Lee&#x27;s session band, The Aggrovators (&quot;flying symbol&quot; technique was started by Winston Grennan, who shared it with Davis).

Lee was instrumental in producing early dub music, working with his friend and dub pioneer King Tubby in the early 1970s. Lee and Tubby were experimenting with new production techniques which Lee described as &quot;implements of sound.&quot; Working with equipment that today would be considered primitive and limiting, they produced tracks that consisted of mostly the rhythm parts mixed with distorted or altered versions of a song.
With all the bass and drum ting now, dem ting just start by accident, a man sing off key, an when you a reach a dat you drop out everything an leave the drum, an lick in the bass, an cause a confusion an people like it...

Lee encouraged Tubby to mix increasingly wild dubs, sometimes including sound effects such as thunder claps and gunshots. In addition to King Tubby, dub mixers Prince Jammy and Philip Smart also worked extensively on Lee&#x27;s productions, with most of Lee&#x27;s dubs from 1976 onwards mixed by Jammy.

In addition to dub sides and instrumentals, Lee would be one of the first producers to realise the potential of reusing the same rhythm tracks time and time again with different singers and deejays, partly out of necessity – unlike some of the other major producers Lee did not have his own studio and had to make the most of the studio time he paid for. The latter half of the 1970s saw Lee work with some of Jamaica&#x27;s top new talent, including Linval Thompson, Leroy Smart, and Barry Brown. 

By 1977 Joe Gibbs and Channel One Studios with the Hookim Brothers became &quot;the place to be&quot;, reducing Lee&#x27;s prominence. However, during the late 1970s Lee produced almost every deejay, notably Dennis Alcapone, U-Roy, I-Roy, Prince Jazzbo, U Brown, Dr Alimantado, Jah Stitch, Trinity, and Tapper Zukie. Most of these were quick productions, usually to classic Studio One or Treasure Isle riddims. The aim was to get deejay versions on the street quickly and were usually voiced at Tubby&#x27;s studio in the Waterhouse district of Kingston. In the early 1980s, Lee purchased Gibbs&#x27; studio in Duhaney Park, and continued producing, albeit on a less prolific basis than in the 1970s.

In 1983, Lee produced the first album by future star Beenie Man, titled &quot;The Invincible Beany Man - The 10 Year Old D.J. Wonder&quot;.

In March 2015, a fire at Lee&#x27;s Gorgon Entertainment Studio destroyed equipment with a value estimated by Lee at JA$100 million.

In March 2020, Lee produced his last dub for the project &quot;Sly &amp; Robbie vs Roots Radics: &#x27;The Dub Battle&#x27;&quot;. The song was &quot;Dub My Mind&quot; by Sly &amp; Robbie feat. the Mighty Diamonds. https://dubblog.de/en/sly-robbie-vs-roots-radics-the-dub-battle/

==Recognition ==
In 1982 an episode of the Channel 4 documentary series &quot;Deep Roots&quot; was dedicated to Lee. Filmed in the control room of King Tubby&#x27;s studio, it included a lengthy conversation with him and some of the musicians he has worked with over the years including Delroy Wilson, Johnny Clarke, Prince Jazzbo and Jackie Edwards. It then shows Lee producing a dub while Prince Jammy mixes. The program was released on DVD in January 2008.

In 2008 he was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican Government in recognition of his contribution to Jamaican music.

In 2013 a documentary film was released, &quot;I Am The Gorgon – Bunny &#x27;Striker&#x27; Lee and the Roots of Reggae&quot;, directed by Diggory Kenrick, telling the story of Lee&#x27;s life from childhood to the present, featuring U Roy, Dennis Alcapone, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Sly and Robbie, Johnny Clarke, John Holt and others.

==Personal life==
Lee had one son, Errol Lee (born 1968), with singer Marlene Webber. Errol was believed to be running a non-profit organisation, Caring Kids&#x27; Concerts, which mentors young people using music, as of October 2020.

At the time of Lee&#x27;s death, his wife was Annette Wong-Lee, mother to four of his children: two sons, Edward Jr. and Kirk, and two daughters, Toni Ann and Bonnie Lee.

==Death==
Lee died at the age of 79 from heart failure on 6 October 2020. He had been suffering from several health issues, including kidney problems relating to diabetes, for some time.

<text>Conceição is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Horta in the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 1,138, in an area of 3.08 km². It is the second smallest parish within the administration of Horta.

==History==
The settlement of the area that became known as &quot;Nossa Senhora da Conceição&quot; was first attributed to the Flemish nobleman Joss van Aard (which was later transliterated into Portuguese as &quot;José da Terra&quot;, literally &quot;Joseph of the Earth/Land&quot;), where he made his home, cultivated a small parcel, and planted fruit trees on the edge of &quot;Ribeira dos Flamengos&quot; (&quot;Ravine of the Flemings&quot;):
:&quot;...who settle along a ravine, today named Ribeira da Conceição, in virtue of the chapel to this invocation that he constructed...&quot;
Along his holdings was a large promontory that overlooked the Bay of Horta, and extended into the Canal that the Flemish colonists referred to as &quot;The Needle&quot; (&quot;&quot;), later to be known in Portuguese as &quot;Espalamaca&quot;.

In 1498, Joss de Utra (the second Captain-donatário of Faial), established his administrative center for the village in the deeper part of the Conceição, thus attracting a settlement wave. A decade after this migration, King Sebastian (30 July 1568) referred to several new communities in the eastern coast of Faial: São Salvador (Matriz), with about 100 to 200 homes; Feteira, Castelo Branco, Praia do Norte, Praia do Almoxarife and Flamengos, with less than 100. In this document, the parish of Nossa Senhora da Conceição was established. Later, friar Diogo das Chagas, a noted historian, in his book &quot;Espelho Cristalino&quot; referred to this parish having 594 inhabitants scattered in 161 buildings.

D&#x27;Utra, would establish his administration at &quot;Rua do Bom Jesus No.16&quot; in Conceição, to house his executive, administration and local jail (referred locally as the &quot;Casa da Câmara e Cadeia&quot;), literally the &quot;House of the Council and Jail&quot;. By 5 November 1632, Fernão Gomes Massam, then &quot;Corregador dos Açores&quot;, reported that the building became incapacitated and its roles were transferred to other buildings within the municipality.

Fortifications were constructed in the lower part of the parish during the 17th Century, including the Fort of Alagoa (July 1621) and later the Fort of Bom Jesus (1821), in order to help protect and defend Horta from pirates and privateers that harassed and sacked the communities of the archipelago.

&quot;Nossa Senhora da Conceição&quot; was actually the second village in the Horta basin, after &quot;Matriz do Santíssimo Salvador&quot;: the parish of Nossa Senhora das Angústias established only in 1684. The historian Gaspar Frutuoso, noted that the &quot;Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição&quot; (&quot;Church of Our Lady of the Conception&quot;) was constructed with three naves, and five columns on each side, and chapel located on its eastern quarter. In 1589, it was sacked by English privateers. In October 1597, it was once again pillaged, but then set aflame. Frair Diogo de Chagas noted that it was rebuilt, starting in 1607, becoming the &quot;“most perfect that existed before&quot;&quot;. It was once again remodelled in 1749, under the direction of Father Teodósio Ferreira de Melo.

In 1701, the Hermitage of Pilar () was built by Father Filipe Furtado de Mendonça, along the edge of the parish (along Espalamaca), where he was eventually buried. In 1729 it was destroyed during a fire. Also, across from the &quot;Casais do Farrobo&quot;, as noted by Gaspar Frutuoso, a chapel for Santo Amaro () was constructed as promised by Braz Pereira Sarmento.

In 1858 the Forte do Bom Jesus, having been almost completely abandoned except for a canon, was requalified in order to house the new jail.

In 1868, a road was finally opened to the chapel of Santo Amaro in Flamengos. It was in the late part of the 19th century that Manuel Inácio de Souza Sarmento, a rich politician in the municipal council of Horta constructed the Palacete of Pilar alongside the Hermitage of Pilar, which would be centre of society until it was divided between his ancestors a century later. The residence was ransacked by his descendants, sold off and occupied by the family of the Viscount Leite-Perry, losing much of its cultural importance.

The planting of the first submarine cable on Alagoa Beach, initiated the &quot;Era das Companhias dos Cabos&quot; (&quot;Era of the Cable Companies&quot;), on 23 August 1893.

The &quot;Palacete do Barão da Ribeirinha&quot; (&quot;Palacette of the Baron of Ribeirinha&quot;), the home of Vitoriano da Rosa Martins, then situated in the &quot;Largo da Igreja Paroquial&quot;, functioned provisionally as the &quot;Liceu da Horta&quot; (&quot;Lyceum of Horta&quot;), an educational school for members of the upper-classes.

The 1926 Horta earthquake caused the inhabitants to become displaced or homeless on 31 August. The grand local church did not escape the tremors, and was irreparably destroyed: it was reconstructed in 1933, in a modest Art Deco-style. Similarly, by the end of the 20th century, the Palacete of Pilar, now completely abandoned, caught fire and was engulfed.

For many years, Father Américo&#x27;s project, the &quot;Casa do Gaiato&quot;, operated a home for abandoned or orphaned children in Conceição. Inaugurated on 28 September 1969, it helped to transition many children into the society of Horta; for 30 years it provided aid and care to these children, under the tutelage of Father Raul de Jesus.

==Geography==
Conceição, along with the parishes of Matriz and Angústias, makes up the northern limit of the city of Horta. Topographically it is divided into two parts: an agricultural area, divided by an escarpment that extends from the Sítio of Volta to the western border with Flamengos, and a more urbanized area along the coast and Ribeira da Conceição, which is directly connected to the rest of Horta. The border extends across Espalamaca towards the &quot;Caminho Velho&quot; (&quot;Old Road&quot;) before cutting across the eastern extend of the Flamengos valley towards the Quinta do São Lourenço, cutting across a minor volcanic cone, before ending at the base of Monte Carneiro. The southern limit of the parish extends from the Estrada Regional E.R.2-2 towards the centre of the city of Horta, through the locality of Santo Amaro, before winding down the Ribeira da Conceição starting around the middle of the &quot;sítio of Volta&quot; to the Atlantic Ocean. From the &quot;Travessa do Mirante da Conceição&quot;, on the southern margin extends towards the municipal courthouse and traffic circle along the &quot;Avenida Marginal&quot;.

Gaspar Frutuoso, referred to the ravine in these terms: &quot;...in days of strong showers, the water strength and quantity of water overflow, difficulting the crossing [of] the center of the village&quot;. Even Frutuoso knew of the importance of this river, as he elaborated that the waters were used for mills along the waters edge, and requiring the bridge to cross between the two settlement agglomerations. Once called the &quot;Foz da Ribeira&quot;, later the &quot;Praia da Alagoa&quot; or &quot;Praia da Conceição&quot; (&quot;Beach of Conceição&quot;), is one of the few natural sand beaches on the island, and along with the Vitorino Nemésio Park () is part of a recreational area in the shadow of Espalamaca.

==Economy==
The main industries in this area are primarily associated with the forest industry (sawmills and carpentry) and civil construction, as well as many commercial businesses located along the coast. In the area of Santo Amaro, the economy is more closely associated with dairy and agriculture.

During the 19th Century, the barrio of Santo Amaro, was known for its bakers that produced bread and pastries for the city of Horta. During the 20th Century the activities were diversified to include many businesses: restaurants, snack-bars, cafes, mini-markets, gymnasiums, clothing shops, designers and publishers, music, stationary stores, furniture shops, jewellery, natural supplement shops, financial services, travel agencies, exporters and spas.

<text>James Healey Willan (12 October 1880 – 16 February 1968) was an English and Canadian organist and composer. He composed more than 800 works including operas, symphonies, chamber music, a concerto, and pieces for band, orchestra, organ, and piano. He is best known for his church music.

==Biography==

Willan was born in England on 12 October 1880 and began musical training at age eight, with studies at St. Saviour&#x27;s Choir School in Eastbourne. He continued at St. Saviour&#x27;s until 1895, when he began working as organist and choirmaster at several London-area churches. He earned, by examination in organ playing, harmony, counterpoint, history and orchestration, the ARCO in 1897 and fellowship in 1899. From 1903 to 1913, he was organist and choirmaster of St. John the Baptist Church on Holland Road in London. The Anglo-Catholic Tractarian movement had led to an Anglican revival of plainsong, and in 1910 Willan joined the London Gregorian Association (which strove to preserve and revive &quot;plain-chant&quot;). In 1913 Willan emigrated to Canada.

Willan became organist-choirmaster of Toronto&#x27;s largest church, St. Paul&#x27;s, Bloor Street, whose rector, Canon Cody, was later to become Ontario provincial education minister and the chancellor of the University of Toronto. In 1914, Willan was appointed a lecturer and examiner in music at the university. His royalties as a church music composer allowed him to leave &quot;low church&quot; St. Paul&#x27;s in 1921 and to become precentor of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene (Toronto). He remained there until his death. St. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s, under Willan, became a North American mecca for choral and Anglican church musicians. In 1934 he founded the Tudor Singers, which he conducted until it disbanded in 1939.

In 1920 the Toronto Conservatory (since 1947 the Royal Conservatory of Music) appointed Willan as head of its theory department. Later he became vice-principal. The conservatory was part of the University of Toronto. Students from the conservatory could become eligible to complete the music degree examinations administered by the university. From 1937 to 1950, Willan was University of Toronto Professor of Music and Organist and responsible for the music degree examinations. 2000 people attended an October 15, 1955 concert in St. Paul&#x27;s to honor his 75th birthday.

His notable pupils included pianists Howard Brown and Naomi Yanova, tenor Gordon Wry, and composers Cecil Gray, Patricia Blomfield Holt, Walter MacNutt, F. R. C. Clarke, Phyllis Gummer, Eldon Rathburn, Robert Fleming, and Kenneth Peacock. 

When the Order of Canada was established in 1967, it named Willan a Companion. In Britain, it was customary for the Archbishop of Canterbury to occasionally grant very distinguished English cathedral musicians the Lambeth Doctorate, Mus. D Cantuar; in 1956 Willan, &quot;the Dean of Canadian composers&quot; became the first non-English church musician to be so honoured; subsequently, many Canadian universities followed suit. Willan was one of the first Canadian musicians to appear on a Canadian postage stamp. It was not lost on young Canadian musicians that Willan was able to make his livelihood as a composer, and that being a composer was something to which they might realistically aspire.

Willan, who would describe his provenance &quot;English by birth; Canadian by adoption; Irish by extraction; Scotch by absorption&quot;, died on 16 February 1968 in Toronto. The park immediately to the east of St. Mary Magdalene church was named in his honour.

==Compositions==
While serving as the organist and choirmaster at St. Paul&#x27;s, Bloor Street, Willan became interested in the music of another Anglican parish, that of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene. St. Paul&#x27;s was an evangelical, low church; St. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s, while much smaller, was notably high church or Anglo-Catholic. By 1920, Willan was assisting with choir practice. In 1921, he resigned his post at St. Paul&#x27;s and turned his attention to St. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s. He set about creating a great many liturgical works for use in the church&#x27;s services and on creating one of the few choirs in North America with expertise in singing unaccompanied music to a very high standard. He remained at St. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s until shortly before his death, last directing the choir in 1967.

Willan composed some 800 musical pieces, the majority sacred works for choir such as anthems, hymns and mass settings. His non-sacred opus includes some 50 choral works, 100 song arrangements for voice with piano accompaniment, many works for piano solo, for voice with instrumental accompaniment, two symphonies, a piano concerto, chamber works, incidental music for stage works, ballad operas, and at least one important opera (&quot;Deirdre&quot;). His &quot;Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue&quot; was inspired by the Max Reger piece of the same name. A 1964 EMI recording by Francis Jackson helped bring the piece into the mainstream repertoire.
In 1953, Willan received a commission to write an anthem for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The resulting anthem, &quot;O Lord Our Governour&quot;, continues to be frequently performed. Willan&#x27;s friends clubbed together to pay for his fare to London, so that he could attend the ceremony in person.

Willan is best known for his sacred choral and organ works, which show evidence of his love for plainsong and Renaissance music. For example, many of his liturgical compositions employ western church modes from a thousand years ago and the modality and harmony of late nineteenth-century Russian Orthodox choral music. His vocal lines are significantly more melismatic, his style more contrapuntal and rhythmically much freer than was the case in the liturgical music of his contemporaries. The lively acoustics at Saint Mary Magdalene allowed the melismatic lines to soar and yet linger at the same time. His larger choral works, however, were very Romantic in nature. His rich harmonic palette and luxuriant, soaring melodies stand as testament to his admiration of both Brahms and Wagner.

:&quot;His music represents a unique and beautiful combination of styles: both an homage to the sacred music of five centuries ago and a reflection of the innovations of the Romantic/post-Romantic period in which he lived.&quot;

==Works==
A fairly comprehensive listing of his works is given at the International Music Score Library Project. The Giles Bryant Healey Willan Catalogue assigns numbers to (some of) Willan&#x27;s works, eg &quot;B314&quot;, Rise up, my love, my fair one.

<text>Flamengos is a Portuguese civil parish () on the island of Faial in the archipelago of the Azores. Its name was derived from the grouping of Flemish settlers who made their homes in this landlocked valley, in the municipality of Horta. The population in 2011 was 1,604, in an area of 14.62 km². It contains the localities Cruz do Bravo, Farrobo, Lameiro Grande, Rua Nova, São Lourenço and Tafoneiro.

==History==

The first settlers that arrived in the area that became known as the &quot;Vale dos Flamengos&quot; (, or literally, &quot;Valley of the Flemish people&quot;), were seeking a sheltered area that provided access to potable water. Their original beachhead, on the &quot;Lomba dos Frades&quot;, in the Praia do Almoxarife valley was a disaster for the first Captain-Donatário Josse van Huerter (in 1465. His return in 1466-67 began a new phase in the island&#x27;s history; discovering the fertile and sheltered geomorphology of the interior valley allowed the group of Flemish settlers to establish a foothold on the island (1468). These early colonizers cultivated small parcels of land along the river, taking advantage of the springs and fertile volcanic soils, cultivating oranges, corn, legumes, as well as servicing the town and other parishes on the island.

The community&#x27;s primitive church (dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora da Luz&quot;) was constructed shortly after the first settlers established their homes, and was a large three-nave over five pillars, sturdy and well constructed (as the historian Gaspar Frutuoso recounted in his Saudades da Terra).

In 1597, Flamengos was raided by English privateers, who remained in the valley for days, pillaging and destroying homes. In 1606 the village of Flamengos had been restored, through the assistance of Jerónimo de Utra Corte Real, and later expanded in 1736, through the initiatives of Manuel Brum da Silveira.

Raul Brandão, in his As Ilhas Desconhecidas (1926), described the parish in these terms: &quot;This use to be more animated and rich. Everything around Horta and Flamengos was houses, orchards full of oranges, plants and flowers, the Estate of São Lourenço, the Estate of the Silveiras, the Estate of the Dabneys...&quot;. Brandão was referring to a period when the wealthy, rich property owners and farmers had their summer homes and estates within the valley: by 1926, the area was less important for the upwardly mobile, who concentrated in their salons in Horta.

On 31 December 1936, a violent earthquake destroyed most of the buildings and homes in the parish. Unfortunately, a similar event occurred on 23 November 1973 and later on 9 June 1998, which permanently destroyed the church of &quot;Nossa Senhora da Luz&quot; (). The church was rebuilt and inaugurated on 3 April 2016.

==Geography==
Flamengos is located about 5 minutes (and 5 kilometers) from the centre of Horta, via several ancillary roadways along the eastern and southern margins of the Atlantic Ocean. The Flamengos valley is an &quot;amphitheater&quot;-shaped area, relatively planar and intersected by ravines that extend from the slopes of the Cabeço do Fogo.

Farmlands dominate the eastern areas and the Flamengos valley, although the flanks of the mountain are used as pastureland and forests. Much of the population is employed in agriculture business, primarily dairy production.

=== Ecoregions/protected areas===
*Parque Florestal de Falca (&quot;&quot;)

==Economy==
The agricultural characteristics of the parish are well known and in cases represent the characteristics of Beiras and Beiras e Trás-os-Montes. The chimneys represent the typical characteristics of southern Portugal.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Fountain of the Bicas (), located along the &quot;Rua do Capitão&quot; was a public fountain used until 1852; it was one of the few fountains used as a public laundry, used communally by the residents of the village, and may have pre-dated the creation of the parish;
* Bridge of Flamengos (), this bridge, another symbol of early 20th Century construction, was begun in 1903 and completed by 1908.
* Estate of São Lourenço (), the old property of Tomás de Porra Pereira, former Captain-Donatorio of Faial, and recently transferred to the islands&#x27;s &quot;Serviços Agrários do Faial&quot; (&quot;&quot;), where for many years it has been used as the location of the island&#x27;s fairs, expositions, folklore festivals and other activities.
* Botanical Garden of Faial (), an interpretative center for common endemic and endangered plants, as well as many varieties of medicinal herbs, used by local residents on the island;

===Religious===
* Hermitage of São João Baptista (), the chapel is located at a junction of the &quot;Estrada da Caldeira&quot; (Largo Jaime Melo-Estrada da Ribeira Funda) in the foothills of the central caldera, an access that islanders traditionally used for pilgrimages () to the caldera on the feast day of John the Baptist (24 June). The erection of a hermitage/chapel came from Manuel da Silveira Brum (who had a summer residence there) and the parish vicar Father João Goulart Cardoso. From the placing of the cornerstone (24 June 1921) the responsibility for the chapel&#x27;s construction fell to the proprietor and was supported by donations from the local congregation. But the project ran slowly, then stopped in 1925, before being restarted by a stipend from José Rodrigues de Amaral, before his death. In 1944 the chapel was concluded, and blessed on the annual feast day by Father António S. de Medeiros, and the first mass held by Father Goulart Cardoso. The isolated chapel is constructed from basaltic stone in the form of a central nave and tower (constructed over the main entranceway).

==Culture==
Traditionally, Flamengos has been the centre of annual &quot;São João da Caldeira&quot; celebrations (or simply &quot;Festas de São João&quot;) on the island, held on 23–24 June. These festivals, which have occurred popularly since the 15th-16th century, included pilgrimages from around the island that journeyed to the central caldera, where they would play music, danced and jumped bonfires during the quasi-religious festivities. While the religious pilgrimages were discontinued, the annual festivities continued as a social event with popular marches, food kiosks, picnicking, dances and the community &quot;Fogueira de São João&quot; (bonfire) highlighting the celebration around midnight. Meanwhile, the following day (24 June) is a municipal holiday (island-wide), that includes a mid-day eucharistic celebration at the hermitage of São João (along the intersection of the &quot;Estrada Regional E.R.1-2ª&quot; and &quot;Rua da Caldeira&quot;, midway towards the summit of the caldera). A community lunch, that includes sardines, musical groups, popular marches, exhibitions, traditional folklore dances are held within the shadow of the small chapel, and rounds out the celebrations.

The Sociedade Filarmónica Nova Artista Flamenguese (), founded on 23 January 1881, was the first band established in Flamengos. Between 1899 and 1912, its musical director was Maestro Francisco Xavier Simaria, but today Mário Francisco Leal Abreu is currently conducting the brass band. Besides this, there is the Tuna e Grupo Folclórico Juvenil dos Flamengos () was founded in 1978 by António da Luz Rodrigues, who served as its director, which recently (1 March 1999) established an ancillary group, the Grupo de Cantares Sons do Vale ().

<text>Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas is a 2004 American direct-to-video animated Christmas anthology fantasy film produced by Disneytoon Studios, Animated By Blur Studio and directed by Matthew O&#x27;Callaghan. The film includes stories directed by Peggy Holmes, O&#x27;Callaghan, Theresa Cullen, and Carole Holliday.

It is the sequel to &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot; (1999). It features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Goofy, Max, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and Scrooge McDuck, in five different segments rather than three like its predecessor. It received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
The narrator recites the first ten words of &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; before saying, &quot;Oh, wait. Different story, but we&#x27;ll still see a mouse!&quot; The narrator then announces new tales of giving and loving, and a book opens to show pop-up elves.

===&quot;Belles on Ice&quot;===
In the first story, Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck compete in an ice-skating competition. The girls are joined by their respective boyfriends, Mickey and Donald, as they prepare to take the ice. Daisy becomes envious of the crowd&#x27;s reaction to Minnie and attempts to steal the spotlight. Minnie performs several daredevil stunts to regain the spotlight while Daisy summons the &quot;Fantasia&quot; Hippos, who become her backup skaters while her counterpart summons the alligators from the 1940 film. When Minnie slips while landing from a stunt blindfolded, Daisy helps her up while feeling sorry for her selfish actions. Minnie feels the same way, so they both reconcile and perform a grand finale as a team.

===&quot;Christmas: Impossible&quot;===
The second story tells the story of Huey, Dewey, and Louie celebrating Christmas Eve with Donald and Daisy Duck at Uncle Scrooge&#x27;s mansion in Duckburg. After they cause trouble at dinnertime, the boys know that they are on the naughty list, so they travel to the North Pole to write their names on Santa&#x27;s good list. At Santa&#x27;s workshop, the trio make a mess while trying to find the key to the room containing Santa&#x27;s good list, but they and the elves clean up to save Christmas. Before they leave, they have a chance to add their names to the good list; however, they add Scrooge&#x27;s name instead. On Christmas, they find a single gift for Scrooge, but Santa leaves a note that explains that their actions caused them to be put on the good list and more presents are behind the tree.

===&quot;Christmas Maximus&quot;===

The third story&#x27;s focus is on Max Goof and his father Goofy celebrating the holidays. A young adult Max brings home his girlfriend Mona to meet his father, Goofy. However, Max is embarrassed by his dad, who labels his car a limo, decorates the house with many Christmas lights, shows baby pictures to Mona, and wipes cocoa off Max&#x27;s face. While wandering outside, he notices that his scarf is made by Goofy and realizes that Goofy is always goofy, and that is why he loves him. Max then forgets about being embarrassed and joins in the fun when the popcorn-making machine goes haywire.

===&quot;Donald&#x27;s Gift&quot;===
The fourth story focuses on Donald Duck and his Christmas wish of peace and quiet. As he returns home from grocery shopping, he is slowed down by daydreaming and a series of well-wishers who sing &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;. Donald becomes increasingly annoyed by the joyous people, and at home, he is annoyed to hear the same Christmas carols on his radio. When Daisy and his nephews arrive, Donald becomes annoyed that they want to go out so soon after he returned home, but Daisy drags him out anyway. At the mall, Donald discovers various objects playing the same Christmas carol; he thinks he is in peace inside a secret room, where he finds animatronics singing. He destroys the entire show at Mousy&#x27;s that Daisy, Huey, Dewey, Louie, and the crowd were trying to see. After he is thrown out of the mall, Donald walks home alone while feeling guilty for his lack of Christmas spirit. He apologizes to everyone for his selfishness and joins the townspeople convened around a Christmas tree happily singing.

===&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Dog-Gone Christmas&quot;===
The fifth and final story stars Mickey as he makes decorations for the Christmas party, which his dog, Pluto keeps interrupting. When Pluto attempts to help by putting the star on the Christmas tree, he accidentally destroys all the decorations and an angry Mickey sends him to his doghouse as punishment. Feeling rejected, Pluto decides to run away from home and finds himself shipped on a train to the North Pole, where Santa&#x27;s reindeer adopt him. Back home, Mickey tidies up the mess and redecorates the house with the new Christmas decorations and attempts to reconcile with Pluto, only to find him missing. Meanwhile, Pluto becomes homesick, so Santa and the reindeer help him go home. They complete the Christmas tree decorations, and everyone celebrates Pluto&#x27;s return.

Like in &quot;Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, the film concludes with a medley of carols featuring the main characters from the five segments as the book closes.

=== Critical response ===
Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;All segments are sufficiently brisk to sustain interest of restless small fry. [...] Computer-generated imagery provides pleasingly colorful, seemingly 3-D eye-candy. Even so, novelty value of classic toon characters in CGI format likely will be lost on little ones raised on &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Toy Story&quot;.&quot; Robert Pardi of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film a grade of three out of five stars, saying, &quot;A candy-cane palate and a festive soundtrack bolster this omnibus, which allows Disney favorites a chance to strut some new stuff.&quot; Rebecka Schumann of &quot;International Business Times&quot; named &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; one of their &quot;best Christmas movie picks for kids.&quot;

Bryce Olin of &quot;FanSided&quot; included &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; in their &quot;Best Christmas Movies on Netflix 2016&quot; list. Michael Thomas of &quot;Collider&quot; included &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; in their &quot;Best Holiday Movies and Shows on Disney+&quot; list, stating, &quot;The computer-animated special allows for the Disney crew to shine with each getting major focus across their individual stories. If you love Mickey and his friends, &quot;Mickey Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; is a wonderful time.&quot; Megan Stein of &quot;Country Living&quot; included &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; in their &quot;35 Best Christmas Movies on Disney+ to Get You In the Holiday Spirit&quot; list.

&quot;People Magazine&quot; included &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; in their &quot;Best Christmas Movies to Stream on Disney+ in 2022&quot; list and called it a &quot;series of heartwarming holiday stories.&quot; Korin Miller and Naydeline Mejia of &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot; included &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; in their &quot;40 Best Christmas Movies On Disney+&quot; list, asserting, &quot;This animated flick features five Christmas-themed shorts that are all kinds of adorable.&quot; Sydni Ellis of &quot;PopSugar&quot; ranked &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot; first in their &quot;17 Best Holiday Movies to Watch With Little Kids&quot; list.

<text>Martin L. Puryear (born May 23, 1941) is an American artist known for his devotion to traditional craft. Working in a variety of media, but primarily wood, his reductive technique and meditative approach challenge the physical and poetic boundaries of his materials. The artist&#x27;s &quot;Liberty/Libertà&quot; exhibition represented the United States at the 2019 Venice Biennale.

==Life==
Born in 1941 in Washington, DC, Martin Puryear began exploring traditional craft methods in his youth, making tools, boats, musical instruments, and furniture. After receiving a BA in Fine Art from the Catholic University of America in 1963, Puryear spent two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone. From 1966 to 1968, he studied printmaking at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, returning to the United States to enroll in the graduate program for sculpture at Yale University. Although he discovered Minimalism at a formative period in his development, Puryear would ultimately reject its impersonality and formalism.

After earning his MFA from Yale, Puryear began teaching at Fisk University in Nashville and University of Maryland in College Park. In 1977, following a devastating fire in his Brooklyn studio, Puryear moved to Chicago and began teaching at the University of Illinois.

In both 1979 and 1981, and again in 1989, his work was included in the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. He travelled to Japan in 1982 through a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship where he investigated architecture and garden design. In 1989, he was awarded the MacArthur Foundation Fellowship and represented the United States at the São Paulo Bienal, Brazil. The Museum of Modern Art organized an exhibition in 2007 that traveled to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, TX, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, CA. In 2012 President Obama awarded him the National Medal of Arts and 2019 he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale.

==Artwork==

The artwork of Martin Puryear is a product of visibly complex craft construction and manipulation of pure material; its forms are combinations of the organic and the geometric. His process can be described as reductive, seeking to bring work and material close to its original state and creating rationality in each work derived from the maker and act of making. This is what Puryear calls &quot;inevitability&quot;, or a &quot;fullness of being within limits&quot; that defines function.

Often associated with both Minimalism and Formalist sculpture, Puryear rejects that his work is ever non-referential or objective. The pure and direct imagistic forms born from his use of traditional craft are allusive and poetic, as well as deeply personal. Visually, they encounter the history of objects and the history of their making, suggesting public and private narratives including those of the artist, race, ritual, and identity. His work is widely exhibited and collected both in the United States and internationally.

For close to fifty years, Puryear has created works that transpose his distinctive abstract sculptural language to a monumental scale. From his earliest outdoor work at Artpark, in Lewistown, New York, in 1977 to his newly inaugurated 2023 permanent commission for Storm King Art Center, Puryear&#x27;s public and site-specific sculptures originate with the artist&#x27;s hand, whether through drawings or with models that the artist carves or fashions from pieces of wood.

=== &quot;Lookout&quot; (2023) ===
In 2023, Puryear completed &quot;Lookout&quot;, his first large-scale sculpture made of brick, at Storm King Art Center in New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley. The artwork is a compound-curved domed shell, pierced by 90 circular apertures of various sizes. Visitors can walk around and into the sculpture, enjoying the views of the surrounding area.

This project had been a structural puzzle until a meeting in 2019 between the artist and MIT professor and structural engineer John Ochsendorf unlocked a solution. Ochesendorf has extensively researched ancient and traditional architectural technologies, particularly masonry vaults and domes. Their meeting resulted in a near-instantaneous collaborative scheme that incorporated the principle of Nubian vaulting, an ancient building method with which Ochsendorf and Puryear were both familiar. Engineering services were provided by Silman Associates, Structural Engineers.

At Storm King the construction was led by Lara Davis (Limaçon Design), a vaulting specialist and practicing architect. After refining the material selection and detailing the construction method, Davis collaborated with the Puryear Studio to build the sculpture. The work was completed over a period of two summers.

Puryear considers &quot;Lookout&quot; to be the most complex sculpture he has completed to date.

<text>Robert Bruce Salter (December 15, 1924 – May 10, 2010) was a Canadian surgeon and a pioneer in the field of pediatric orthopaedic surgery.

Born in Stratford, Ontario, he graduated in medicine from the University of Toronto in 1947, worked for two years at the Grenfell Medical Mission in Newfoundland, and spent one year as the McLaughlin Fellow in Oxford, England. Salter then returned to join the medical staff at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto in 1955. He was later appointed surgeon-in-chief.

Salter developed a procedure to correct congenital dislocation of the hip, pioneered continuous passive motion for the treatment of joint injuries, and co- developed a classification of growth plate injuries in children, commonly known as the Salter–Harris fractures classification system. He also developed the supraacetabular innominate osteotomy (i.e. the Salter osteotomy) to treat operatively congenital dislocation of hip. His textbook of orthopaedic surgery, &quot;Disorders and Injuries of the Musculoskeletal System&quot;, is used throughout the world.

He was made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1977 and was promoted to companion in 1997. In 1988, he was awarded the Order of Ontario. In 1995 he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He was also a fellow of the Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada, and received the Gairdner Foundation International Award for medical science, the FNG Starr Medal of the Canadian Medical Association and the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Zimmer Award for Distinguished Achievement in Orthopaedic Research.

Salter died on May 10, 2010.

<doc id="1166833" wikidata="Q2390665" url="?curid=1166833" title="Brazilian Carnival">
<text>The Carnival of Brazil (, ) is an annual festival held the Friday afternoon before Ash Wednesday at noon, which marks the beginning of Lent, the forty-day period before Easter. During Lent, Roman Catholics and some other Christians traditionally abstain from the consumption of meat and poultry, hence the term &quot;carnival&quot;, from &quot;carnelevare&quot;, &quot;to remove (literally, &quot;raise&quot;) meat.&quot;

Carnival is the most popular holiday in Brazil and has become an event of huge proportions. Except for industrial production, retail establishments such as malls, and carnival-related businesses, the country unifies completely for almost a week and festivities are intense, day and night, mainly in coastal cities. Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s carnival alone drew 6 million people in 2018, with 1.5 million being travelers from inside and outside Brazil. Rio&#x27;s carnival is the largest in the world according to Guinness World Records.

Historically its origins can be traced to the Portuguese Age of Discoveries when their caravels passed regularly through Madeira island, a territory which already celebrated emphatically its carnival season, and where they were loaded with goods but also people and their ludic and cultural expressions.

== Characteristics ==
Rhythm, participation, and costumes vary from one region of Brazil to another. In the southeastern cities of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Vitória, huge organized parades are led by samba schools. Those official parades are meant to be watched by the public, while minor parades (&quot;blocos&quot;) allowing public participation can be found in other cities, like Belo Horizonte, also in the southeastern region. The northeastern cities of Recife, Olinda, Salvador, and Porto Seguro have organized groups parading through streets, and public interacts directly with them. It is a six-day party where crowds follow the trios elétricos through the city streets, dancing and singing. Also in northeast, Olinda carnival features unique characteristics, heavily influenced by local folklore and cultural manifestations, such as &quot;Frevo&quot; and &quot;Maracatu&quot;.

The typical genres of music of Brazilian carnival are, in the Southeast Region in general, mostly cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo: the samba-enredo, the samba de bloco, the samba de embalo and the marchinha; and in the Northeast Region including Pernambuco (mostly cities of Olinda and Recife): frevo and maracatu, and Bahia (mostly the city of Salvador): samba-reggae, pagode (also a type of Samba) and the main genre axé music. These rhythms were mainly developed by Afro-Brazilians and Pardos, incorporating and adapting many cultural influences, from the percussion beats of Africa to the military fanfares of Europe and iberian music in the use of instruments like pandeiro and cavaquinho.

Brazilian carnival in essence is a synthesis of European, Native American, and Afro-Brazilian cultural influences, each group has played an important role in the development of the structure and aesthetic of the Brazilian carnival of today. For instance, the main rhythms used in carnival celebrations were developed by Afro-Brazilians and make use of European instruments like the cavaquinho and pandeiro to create melodies and arrangements, also the fantasies and costumes in the Brazilian carnival borrow concepts from the clothing of the Native American populations, in the use of feathers and the tendency to use lighter pieces. Religious cultural references are also common in Rio&#x27;s carnival, specially those related to Catholicism and Afro Candomblé practices.

== Disruptions ==
The Carnival was first suspended in 1912, following the death of the Baron of Rio Branco, at the time Brazilian Minister of External Relations. The mayor of Rio reportedly postponed all licenses for the Carnival associations, but despite this many residents still partied in the streets anyway. The Carnival went on as scheduled despite World War I and World War II, besides during Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship, despite strict regulations.

The first disruption to the carnival in 108 years took place in late September 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, when the 2021 festival was cancelled. The next festival was initially scheduled from 26 February – 2 March 2022, depending on the evolution of the epidemiological situation in the country, but was also ultimately cancelled. The carnival celebrations finally returned on 19 February 2023 after two years of hiatus, but floods and landslides caused some festivities to be cancelled.

== By region ==
=== Rio de Janeiro ===

In the late 18th century, the &quot;cordões&quot; (literally &quot;cords&quot;, &quot;laces&quot; or &quot;strings&quot; in Portuguese) combined with the &quot;dança do coco&quot; (literally &quot;coconut dance&quot; an Afro-Brazilian dance troupe form) were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as &quot;Carnaval blocos&quot; (blocks), consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes and/or logos. &quot;Blocos&quot; are generally associated with particular neighbourhoods; they include both a percussion or music group and an entourage of revelers. They eventually became the &quot;fathers&quot; of what everyone today knows as the famous and internationally renowned samba-schools in Brazil. Samba-schools (not only in Rio de Janeiro, but in São Paulo and several other cities) are the cultural epicenter of the Brazilian carnival, in terms of the &quot;parading style&quot;. The first registered samba-school was called &quot;Deixa-falar&quot;, but disappeared later and the first official samba-school contest happened in 1929, with only three groups, and &quot;Oswaldo Cruz&quot; group won the competition, with a samba written by Heitor dos Prazeres. GRES Estação Primeira de Mangueira Samba-School, represented by Cartola, and Estácio de Sá samba School, represented by Ismael Silva, were the other 2 contestants. Eventually, &quot;Oswaldo Cruz&quot; became Portela Samba School, the greatest winner of Rio&#x27;s Carnival with 22 Titles. Although many Brazilians tend now to favor other forms of national music culture to that of Rio&#x27;s samba schools, the carnival of Rio de Janeiro remains the national festival par excellence, and the samba of Rio de Janeiro continues to be an agent of national unification.
&quot;Carnaval blocos&quot;, also known as &quot;Blocos de Rua&quot; (&quot;Street Blocks&quot;) occur in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city and metropolitan areas, but the most famous are the ones in Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Lagoa, Jardim Botânico, and in downtown Rio. Organizers often compose their own music themes that are added to the performance and singing of classic &quot;marchinhas&quot; and samba popular songs. &quot;Cordão do bola preta&quot; (&quot;Polka Dot Bloco&quot;), that goes through the heart of Rio&#x27;s historical center, and &quot;Suvaco do Cristo&quot; (&#x27;Armpit of Christ the Redeemer&#x27;, referring to the angle of the statue seen from the neighborhood), near the Botanical Garden, are some of the most famous groups. &quot;Monobloco&quot; has become so famous that it plays all year round at parties and small concerts.

The formalized samba schools are very small groups of performers, financed by respected organizations (as well as legal gambling groups), who work year-round in preparation for Carnival. Samba Schools perform in the Sambadrome, which runs four entire nights and is overseen by LIESA. They are part of an official competition, divided into seven divisions, in which a single school is declared the winner, according to ten judging categories that include costume, flow, theme, and band music quality and performance. Some samba schools also hold street parties in their neighborhoods, through which they parade along with their followers.

All performers at the Sambadrome have to wear a costume. Some honored members of the school or community may receive one for free, but normally, most will have to pay for their own. Tourists can have the same experience on the &quot;Commercial Area&quot; of some Samba Schools but need to buy their own costume from the school, or through an agent, either of which can be quite costly.

===Bahia===
There are several major differences between Carnival in the state of Bahia in Northeastern Brazil and Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. The musical styles are different at each carnival; in Bahia there are many rhythms, including samba, samba-reggae, axé, etc., while in Rio there is the multitude of samba styles: the &quot;samba-enredo&quot;, the &quot;samba de bloco&quot;, the &quot;samba de embalo&quot;, the &quot;funk-samba&quot;, as well as the famous &quot;marchinhas&quot; played by the &quot;bandas&quot; in the streets.
By the 1970s, four main types of carnival groups developed in Bahia: Afoxês, Trios Elétricos, &quot;Amerindian&quot; groups, and Blocos Afros. Afoxês use the rhythms of the African inspired religion, Candomblé. They also worship the gods of Candomblé, called orixás. An Electric Trio is characterized by a truck equipped with giant speakers and a platform where musicians play songs of local genres such as axé. People follow the trucks singing and dancing. The &quot;Amerindian&quot; groups were inspired by Western movies from the United States. The groups dress up as Native Americans and take on Native American names. Blocos Afros, or Afro groups, were influenced by the Black Pride Movement in the United States, independence movements in Africa, and reggae music that denounced racism and oppression. The groups inspired a renewed pride in African heritage.

Today, Bahia&#x27;s carnival consists mostly of Trios Elétricos, but there are still Blocos Afros and Afoxês. Every year, about half a million tourists are attracted to Salvador. It is also possible to watch everything from the Camarotes (ringside seats) spread out along the way, offering more comfort to the visitors.

===Pernambuco===

The northeast state of Pernambuco has unique Carnivals in its present capital Recife and in its colonial capital Olinda. Their main rhythms are the &quot;frevo&quot; and the &quot;maracatu.&quot; &quot;Galo da Madrugada&quot; is the biggest carnival parade in the world, considering the number of participants, according &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records.&quot; It means &quot;dawn&#x27;s rooster&quot; and parades, as the name suggests, in the morning only. &quot;Frevo&quot; is Pernambucan-style dance with acrobatic-like movements, as it is fast and electrifying, often using an open umbrella and frequent legs and arms movements.

Unlike Salvador and Rio, the festivities in Recife, Olinda and Itamaraca do not include group competitions. Instead, groups dance and play instruments side by side. &quot;Troças&quot; and &quot;maracatus&quot;, mostly of African influence, begin one week before Carnival and end a week later.

=== São Paulo===

The carnival in São Paulo takes place in the Anhembi Sambadrome on the Friday and Saturday night of the week of Carnival, as opposed to Rio&#x27;s Carnival, which is held on Sunday and Monday night.

Various &quot;samba schools&quot; compete in a huge parade. Each school presents a different theme, which they expose through their costumes, dance, music, and the allegorical cars or &quot;carros alegóricos&quot;, huge vehicles decorated according to the theme designed specifically for the parade. The schools are responsible for choosing their own themes, which usually revolve around historical happenings or some sort of cultural or political movement.

&quot;Vai-Vai&quot; is the oldest school and has been the Special Group champion most times (15 total, including the 2015 championship). It also is the most popular, for it has a larger fan base and many supporters among the people of the city.

It is considered the most LGBTQ+ friendly Carnival in Brazil. In 2017, the Sexual Diversity Museum of São Paulo formed its own Carnival group to provide the message of inclusion, peace, and respect for all LGBT people. In 2020, São Paulo Carnival has featured Camilla Prins, the first transgender woman to lead a samba school in any Carnival event in Brazil.

=== Espírito Santo===

The Carnival in Vitória are performed one week before Carnival, more precisely in Sambão do Povo. The schools are responsible for choosing their own themes, which usually revolve around historical happenings or some sort of cultural or political movement.

More than the traditional school parade, the carnival in Espirito Santos includes a large set of attractions, especially in the beach areas of the state, from north to south.

===Minas Gerais===

Carnival in Minas Gerais is often characterized by &quot;blocos carnavalescos&quot; with varying themes and costume styles, typically accompanied by a brass and drums band. The carnival has been heavily influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Carnival, and several cities hold parades with samba schools. More recently, Axé groups from Bahia come to play in the state.
The most traditional carnival parades happen in the historic cities of Ouro Preto, Mariana, São João del Rei, and Diamantina.
Since the 2010s, the carnival in the state capital Belo Horizonte has increased heavily in popularity, 
Other cities in the state, such as Juiz de Fora, Abaeté, Pompéu, and Três Pontas, also have popular parades.

Ouro Preto is popular among college students. The city has a large proportion of students, who during the year live in places called Repúblicas (a Brazilian equivalent to a frat house). During carnival, the Repúblicas turn to affordable accommodation for both residents and visitors coming from all over the country. The city hills, narrow streets, and stone pavement prevent traffic of heavy sound trucks.
Zé Pereira dos Lacaios, the oldest carnival block in Brazil with more than 150 years, parade in the city.

The first carnival party in Belo Horizonte took place in 1897, even before the inauguration of the city.
Still, for decades the carnival in the city was not as popular as in historical cities.
Beginning in the 2010s the situation has changed, and the carnival has started gaining increased popularity. 
In 2017, Belo Horizonte had the largest carnival in its history and the third-largest in Brazil. There were more than three million people on the streets, with about 500,000 tourists. The Baianas Ozadas block hit a record audience of 500,000 people.

Juiz de Fora had one of the three largest carnivals in Brazil in the 1980s. But it has been steadily losing popularity. A deadlock between the league of local samba schools (LIESJUF) and the municipality&#x27;s culture agency (Funalfa) prevented parades in the city since 2016. As a temporary solution, the parades have been held at Intendente Magalhães.

===Others===
Some Southern cities such as Uruguaiana, Florianópolis, and Porto Alegre have smaller samba school groups or blocos, but like São Paulo state towns, they seem to prefer balls to street dancing. Curitiba hosts modest carnival celebrations similar to those of other Brazilian cities and events such as Curitiba Rock Festival and a carnival Zombie Walk, all supported by Cultural Foundation of Curitiba which operates under supervision of government of Curitiba.

==Sambódromo==

The Carnival parades in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo take place in their &quot;sambódromos&quot;, located close to the city center. In the Rio Sambódromo, the parades start at 20:00 or 21:00 (depending on the date) and end around 5:00 in the morning. The Rio de Janeiro Metro operates 24 hours during the main parade days.

==Music==

===Samba===
The samba is still one of the most popular music styles in Brazil despite its extensive history. Its origins can be traced back to the 19th century in Salvador, Bahia which had strong links with western Africa and a contained a large black slave and ex-slave population. After the abolition of slavery, many immigrated to Rio de Janeiro in order to start a new life. The hillside neighbourhoods known as &quot;Little Africa&quot; were where samba flourished. Despite much initial distaste for the genre from the Brazilian government and those of high social class (who were striving for a more European culture), &quot;sambistas&quot; continued playing, singing, and dancing the samba. From intimate samba-canções (samba songs) sung in bars to explosive drum parades performed during carnival, samba always evokes a warm and vibrant mood. In the 1930s, a group of musicians led by Ismael Silva founded in the neighborhood of Estácio de Sá the first samba school, Deixa Falar. During this period &quot;blocos de carnaval&quot;(groups of black individuals from the favelas, hillside slums, who came together to dance and sing samba during carnaval time) were being targeted by police for causing too much agitation with their performances. By creating organized institutions these people were able to find solace and protection in this newly legitimized practice. These samba schools gave many living in the slums a purpose in life, furthering the genre and dance&#x27;s importance to many Brazilians. They transformed the musical genre to make it fit better the carnival parade. In this decade, the radio spread the genre&#x27;s popularity all around the country. The song Pelo Telefone by Donga and Mauro de Almeida is the first song to really skyrocket Samba&#x27;s appeal and acclaim in Brazil. The nationalist and populist dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas used samba (inspired by the ideas of Gilberto Freyre) in creating a homogenous national culture, and many samba songs broadcast on the radio were censored to ensure the regime&#x27;s nationalist messages were being diffused. 

In the following years, samba has developed in several directions, from the gentle samba-canção to the drum orchestras which make the soundtrack of carnival parade. One of these new styles was bossa nova, a musical movement initially spearheaded by young musicians and college students from Rio de Janeiro. It got increasingly popular over time, with the works of João Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim. In the sixties, Brazil was politically divided, and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to draw attention to the music made in the favelas. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Names like Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho, Velha Guarda da Portela, Zé Keti, and Clementina de Jesus recorded their first albums. In the seventies, the samba got back to radio. Composers and singers like Martinho da Vila, Clara Nunes, and Beth Carvalho dominated the hit parade.

===Frevo===

Frevo is a wide range of musical styles originating from Recife and Olinda, Pernambuco, Brazil, all of which are traditionally associated with Brazilian Carnival. The word &quot;frevo&quot; is said to come from &quot;frever&quot;, a misspeaking of the Portuguese word &quot;ferver&quot; (to boil). It is said that the sound of the &quot;frevo&quot; will make listeners and dancers to feel as they are boiling on the ground. The word frevo is normally used interchangeably either to mean the frevo music or the frevo dance.

The frevo music came first, which is carnival music played by brass or wind marching bands combined with parts of the samba school drumline. By the end of the 19th century, bands from the Brazilian Army regiments based in the city of Recife started a tradition of parading during the Carnival. Since the Carnival is originally linked to religion, they played religious procession marches and martial music, as well. A couple of regiments had famous bands that attracted many followers and it was just a matter of time to people start to compare one to another and cheer for their favorite bands. The two most famous bands were the &quot;Espanha&quot; (meaning Spain), whose conductor was of Spanish origin, and the &quot;14&quot;, from the 14th regiment. The bands started to compete with each other and also started playing faster and faster, louder and louder.

===Axé===

As singer Daniela Mercury began her rise to stardom in Rio and São Paulo, anything coming from Salvador would be labeled Axé Music. Soon, the artists became oblivious to the derogatory origins of the term and started taking advantage of it. With the media pushing it forward, the soundtrack of Carnival in Salvador quickly spread over the country (through off-season Carnival shindigs), strengthening its industrial potentials and producing year-round hits along the 90s.

Tested within the height of Carnival heat, Axé songs have been commercially successful in Brazil throughout the past decade. The year 1998 was particularly fortunate for the artists from Bahia: together, Daniela Mercury, Claudia Leitte, Ivete Sangalo, Asa de Aguia, Chiclete com Banana, Araketu, Cheiro de Amor, and É o Tchan sold over 3.4 million records.

== TV broadcasting ==
The Brazilian Carnival Parades were first broadcast in the late 1960s on television on Rede Globo, which brought the Rio celebrations live, bringing the celebrations to more people all over the nation. By the 1970s, color broadcasting and satellite transmissions made the broadcasts to be beamed to other parts of the nation in real-time, by then featuring the top schools under, since 1984 the Liga Independente das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro – also known as the &quot;Special Group&quot; (since 1990), and formerly under the Associação das Escolas de Samba da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro. The now-defunct Rede Manchete broadcast the event on several occasions and mounted a joint broadcast with Globo for the 1987 event.

Since 1991, Globo&#x27;s broadcast of the parades, now dubbed &quot;Globeleza&quot;, at the Sambodrome in Rio and São Paulo have become the center of national and international attention. Until 2017, fans of the samba schools on parade also expected to watch a short preview of the performances of the schools involved to be broadcast during the duration of the event. By 2018 lyric video style adverts appeared in their place, complete with the colours of the competing schools in attendance, featuring the lyrics of the songs to be performed by the schools.

Globo acquired also the rights to air the parade of samba schools of São Paulo in 1990, and victory parades there were later aired in other local TV channels. Parades belonging to the Access Group (5th Division) and the B Series schools in Rio were also broadcast on several TV stations and are still the case today (in 2015 Rede Record and NGT aired the parades of the lower-level schools). Since 2014, Globo also has full rights to the A Series (Rio) and Paulista parades, which were co-shared with the Viva Channel before its closure in 2015 (which aired lower-level parades and the victory parades of the two cities&#x27; winning schools for the year) and regionally, RBS airs the Carnivals of Florianopólis and Porto Alegre, and since 2015, cable channel TVCOM display the gaucho parades in the south. The Rio parade can also be heard on radio and seen via online streaming as well (thru TVG Rio and from 2015 in G1, which offers an online live streaming of the victory parade). In 2023, Rede Bandeirantes took over the broadcasting rights for the A Series.

The Carnivals of Recife and Salvador are shown by Band since the early 2000s, and Band also holds broadcast rights for the victory parade. Both fall under the &quot;Band Folia&quot; brand. This is also the case for SBT which also broadcasts the events under the &quot;SBT Folia&quot; banner and is also, since recently, seen via live streaming on YouTube. Since 2008, Globo also has its own broadcast team and crew for the broadcasts of the late night Galo da Madrugada in Recife.

<text>The Korean tea ceremony (, ) is a traditional form of tea ceremony practiced in Korea. Darye literally refers to &quot;etiquette for tea&quot; or &quot;tea rite&quot; and has been kept among Korean people for over a thousand years. The chief element of the Korean tea ceremony is the ease and naturalness of enjoying tea within an easy formal setting.

Tea ceremonies are now being revived in Korea as a way to find relaxation and harmony in the fast-paced new Korean culture, and continuing in the long tradition of intangible Korean art.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The first historical record documenting the offering of tea to an ancestral god describes a rite in the year 661 in which a tea offering was made to the spirit of King Suro, the founder of the Geumgwan Gaya Kingdom (42–562). Records from the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) show that tea offerings were made in Buddhist temples to the spirits of revered monks.

Important national rituals involving tea drinking were being presided over by the government officials of the &quot;Tabang&quot; department. There is at least one ritual recorded in the &quot;Goryeosa Yaeji&quot;, or The Official History of Goryeo, mentioned as part of receiving a Chinese messenger to the court.

=== Joseon dynasty ===
During the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), the ritualistic drinking of tea continued and was further refined. &quot;Tabang&quot; sustained and organized the main royal ceremony. The royal Yi family and the aristocracy used tea for simple rites, the &quot;Day Tea Rite&quot; was a common daytime ceremony, whereas the &quot;Special Tea Rite&quot; was reserved for specific occasions. They were codified in the 1474 &quot;National Five Rites&quot; (&quot;Gukjo Oryeui&quot;, 國朝五禮儀, 국조오례의). These terms are not found in other countries.

But plantation problems changed many ways Korean tea was governed. Unlike tea plantation areas in China or Japan, the climate of the Korean Peninsula is much colder and Tea harvesting season occurs just before the spring. So at that period, the tea tree forested areas in the mountains were still so cold and also dangerous because of wildlife. The old Korean name of tea, 설록(&quot;Seollok&quot;, 雪綠), means the first flush tea leaf was harvested on the snow field of a mountain. This situation brought much trouble during the Goryeo dynasty and Joseon dynasty.

The tea tree forested area is also the traditional Breadbasket of Korea and the tea leaf harvesting season and cereal seeding season overlap each other. Because of its value, farmers who lived around tea tree forested regions paid a steep tea tax to the king. So harvesting and treating tea leaves is pointed out as the major cause of the decrease in annual tea crop harvest. In the Goryeo dynasty, there were hundreds of appeals by many lieges and scholars such as Lee Je-hyun or Lee Gyu-bo. And finally at the end of the Goryeo dynasty, recorded in the &quot;Yuduryurok(유두류록, 遊頭流錄)&quot;, farmers burnt or chopped their tea trees to protest against the tea tax. In the case of the Joseon dynasty, governed based on Confucianism, Tabang was sustained for tea ceremony but reduced the scale of tea production in order to protect the agricultural balance. Because of this, the development of the tea industry was prevented for a very long time. And except for Yangban and the royal family, Korean original tea drinking culture and ceremony remained in a limited area around tea tree forested regions.

However, by the middle of the Joseon dynasty, there appears to have been a decline in tea drinking except for the anniversary ceremonies. It is said, that when the Ming Commander, Yang Hao, told King Seonjo (r.1567-1601) during the Japanese invasion that he had discovered high-quality tea plants in Korea, and that &quot;if you were to sell the tea in Liaodong, you could get a silver coin for every ten pounds of tea. Altogether, that would be enough silver to buy ten thousand horses.&quot; King Seonjo, however, replied &quot;We do not have a tea drinking custom in our country.&quot;

=== Post-Joseon dynasty ===
Towards the end of the Joseon dynasty, commoners joined the trend and used tea for ancestral rites. Silhak scholars, like Jeong Yak-yong, Kim Jeong-hui, had interests in tea &quot;drinking&quot; culture and its production at their exile period on tea forested region. These people corresponded with monks who still had tea drinking culture. It started from Silla and Goryeo dynasty that monks formed and administered tea forests around temples and the tradition passed down as their possession. And Buddhist tea ceremony and drinking culture stylized in the traditional temple. And these two cultural leader group&#x27;s relationship influenced both Seonbi society and contemporary monks.

=== Since 1960 ===
After the Japanese occupation and the Korean War, tea culture in Korea became rare, scarce, and was largely forgotten. In the 1960s, Choe Kilsung was commissioned by the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration to investigate tea culture, and found that several temples were cultivating their own private tea gardens. In the 1970s, the &quot;Korean Tea Culture Revival Movement&quot; began in Korea.

In 1973 Lee Gwilye began researching the classics, and in 1979 she founded the Korean Tea People&#x27;s Association.

==Equipment==
Korean tea ceremonies follow the seasons, and the ceramics and metalware used vary. Religious traditions were influential.
Stoneware was common, earthenware more frequent, mostly made in provincial kilns, with porcelain rare, imperial porcelain with dragons the rarest. Examples of equipment used in this ceremony are also discussed in the general entry Korean Ceramics as well as the more specific Korean pottery with images cited.

Historically the appearance of the bowls and cups is naturalistic, with a division according to religious influence. Celadon or jade green, &quot;punchong&quot; (), or bronze-like weathered patinas for Buddhist tea rituals; the purest of white with faint designs in porcelain for Confucian tea rituals; and coarser porcelains and ash-stone glazes for animist tea rituals, or for export to Japan where they were known as &quot;gohan chawan&quot;. An aesthetic of rough surface texture from a clay and sand mix with thin glazing was particularly prized and copied. The randomness of this creation was said to provide a &quot;now moment of reality&quot; treasured by tea masters.

Glazing has a very rich texture and variations between many tones occur that change colour according to light and season. Clay used was generally light, with celadon clays being particularly prized.

Glazing tricks could imitate most materials: from bamboo, through pebbles in rivers, through tree-bark, to human skin, with rare and unique glazes that gave tiger&#x27;s eye, peach, or snow-like attributes in deep snow-drift glazes or fine etched white porcelain. Thus enhancing memories of seasons, poems, writings, or still moments.

Potting style, glazing, and form vary according to date. Old designs are still kept up, and exports to Japan were significant, from the late 16th century onwards. Korean potters such as the Yi Sukkwang (이숙황) and Yi Kyeong (이경), brothers transferred traditional styles abroad that became known as the &quot;Hagi&quot; styles. Individual families of potters and provincial kilns provided highly individual glazes whose depth identifies the best middle &quot;Joseon jagi&quot; (Joseon wares).

Summer tea equipment consisted of &quot;katade&quot; bowls that were tall and wide. The dimensions exposed a maximum surface area to aid in cooling boiled water. Hot water would be poured into the bowls, allowed to cool a bit, then poured into a teapot. The water was cooled because pouring boiling hot water over tea leaves extracts too much of the bitter taste and results in a bitter tea. With two hands, the tea would be poured into smaller matching cups with covers, and placed on a rough wood or lacquer table. The tea was drunk by lifting the cup cover while drinking so as not to show the open mouth. Tea would be taken cool.

Autumn and winter tea equipment consisted of taller narrower bowls, such as the &quot;irabo&quot; style, that would contain and maintain heat. Typically of spiral construction, shallow, with a high rim. Once again tea made within that bowl would then be poured into heated teapots, and poured centered over a smaller matching cup with cover. Tea would be taken hot. And once again repeatedly poured in small spurts from cup to cup so as to prevent flavour concentrated in one cup.

Unlike the Chinese tradition, no Korean tea vessels used in the ceremony are tested for a fine musical note. Judgment instead is based on naturalness in form, emotion, and colouring.

==A natural approach to tea==
Central to the Korean approach to tea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation.

This leads to a wider variance of teahouse design, tea garden entries and gardens, different use and styles of teawares, and regional variations in the choice of tea, choice of cakes and biscuits and snacks, seasonal and temporal variations, and the acoustic and visual ambiance of Korean teahouses.

Tea storage containers were often large – being made of clay coils, finished on potter&#x27;s wheels, and 3/4 glazed from within the kiln itself as wood burned. Natural green ash glazes were typical. A wood scoop with a long handle often a split bamboo with a scoop end would be used to retrieve the tea.

Generally the best local water is used to make the tea, and at times some of the best Korean teahouses had their own small springs. Water is brought to boil above a wood fire, poured into a teapot and brought immediately to service.

Tea is poured initially by a tea hostess into warmed cups from a heated teapot at a distance above the first cup so as to create a controlled flow of tea with attractive bubbles. This is done to create good luck.

Tea ceremonies have always been used for important occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, and remembrance of old friends, and are increasingly a way to rediscovering the joys of Seon meditation.

As Korean tea was often green tea, even small leaves were rare.

One of the modern variations of the Korean tea ceremony involves a low tea table around which the guests and master sit. The tea master or host will sit on one side and will heat and pour and clean the tea ware as part of the whole ceremony from start to finish. The host or master will often keep all the tea ware on the tea table all year, and will cover it with a cloth while not using it. The collection is often made up of several different teapots, often with many different color &amp; shape teacups. The ceremony begins with all the guests sitting around the table and as the water heats the host will begin the conversation, usually with informal or casual questions, such as asking about the guests&#x27; family.

The host will start the official ceremony by first heating the pot, cups and decanting bowl with hot water, then after this is complete, will pour the tea leaves – usually green tea – into the pot. Then the host pours hot water onto the leaves and will then pour out the water very quickly, thereby rinsing the leaves of any dust and opening them up slightly. Then, the host will pour the hot water into the decanting bowl and allow it to cool to the correct temperature for the tea they are using. This depends on when the tea is picked; tea picked earlier in the season, such as the first buds picked in early April, will be steeped at lower temperatures () than tea leaves picked in June (). Once the water is at the right temperature, the host will pour the water into the pot and steep it for anywhere from 20 seconds to two to three minutes, depending on the tea. After steeping is complete, the host pours the tea into the decanting bowl, which serves to get the water off the leaves in the pot and also to give the tea an even mixture. Then it is poured into the cups. The guests will wait until the host or master picks up their cup first, then will pick up theirs. This is repeated until they are finished, which sometimes can be several hours later. The whole ceremony is very relaxing and is a wonderful way to get to know someone or to ease into a business transaction.

==Kinds of tea==
The earliest kinds of tea used in tea ceremonies were heavily pressed cakes of black tea, the equivalent of aged pu-erh tea still popular in China. Vintages of tea were respected, and tea of great age imported from China had a certain popularity at court. However, importation of tea plants by Buddhist monks brought a more delicate series of teas into Korea, and the tea ceremony.

While green tea, &quot;chaksol&quot; or &quot;chugno&quot;, is most often served, other teas such as &quot;Byeoksoryung&quot; Chunhachoon, Woojeon, Jakseol, Jookro, Okcheon, as well as native chrysanthemum tea, persimmon leaf tea, or mugwort tea may be served at different times of the year.

Korean teas were divided into the five different tastes: bitterness, sweetness, astringency, saltiness and &quot;sourness&quot;. Aging is rare and most teas are consumed as fresh as possible, with particular note to new harvests.

Tea regions were famous for producing teas with characteristic compositions of the five taste elements: Jeju Island, contemporarily, has teas with more salt in them due to ocean winds; other elements are brought out by different means of cooking the leaves, or hardness of water.

Teas also evoke four kinds of thought for Korean Buddhists: peacefulness, respectfulness, purity and quietness. Those teas that bring out more of these qualities are prized.

==Kinds of Tea Ceremonies==

Buddhist monks incorporated tea ceremonies into votive offerings. However, the Goryeo nobility and later the Confucian yangban scholars formalized the rituals into things of beauty.

There are at least 15 major tea ceremonies that are performed, and they include, they are listed according to age and fame:

* Day Tea Rite - Joseon dynasty daily palace tea ceremony
* Special Tea Rite - Joseon dynasty ceremony welcoming visiting foreigners, trade and tribute missions, and at royal weddings
* Queen Tea Ceremony - a special tea ceremony shown upon occasion in royal Korean soap operas: only for women friends, family and servants of the Queen, but often including the Crown Prince.

Matcha, or powdered green tea, has also enjoyed limited popularity in Korea. Tea leaves ground into very fine powder are traditionally associated with the Japanese Tea Ceremony, but in Korea this form of tea has regained a certain amount of regard, especially with Buddhists. Myeong-san cha, or meditation tea is a form of meditation in and of itself. It is said to have been popular among monks practicing meditation for many days without sleep. Matcha contains more nutritional value than even regular ip-cha, or leaf tea. All of the tea leaf is consumed and it contains higher amounts of vitamin C, tannins and polyphenols.

With the advent of Christianity in Korea, this kind of meditation tea is viewed as Buddhist and is largely ignored by many, based solely on religious beliefs. True da-in, or tea people relish the physical and cerebral benefits of matcha.

==Traditional Tea Ceremonies and Modern Restorations==

The modern times represent the period of revival and restoration of the traditional Korean tea culture and tea ceremonies in Korea. Of many involved in various traditional cultural efforts, Myung Won, Kim Mi-Hee held the first ever Korean tea culture research and academic conference in 1979, and in the subsequent year of 1980, Myung Won held the first ever public presentation of the comprehensive procedures of traditional Korean tea ceremonies at the Sejong cultural center. The tea ceremonies of the royal court, Buddhist temple tea ceremonies, Guest Greeting tea ceremonies and Everyday tea ceremony were resorted and presented. These traditional Korean tea ceremonies are being carried on today by Myung Won&#x27;s second daughter, Kim Eui-Jung, who is the proprietor of the Intangible Cultural Asset 27 of Seoul, the Royal Court Tea ceremony.

With the recognition of healthful effects of tea and increasing awareness of traditional culture, there is an increasing awareness of Korean tea culture and practice of tea ceremonies and there are many interest groups in Korea today.

==Contemporary revival of Tea Ceremonies at Panyaro Institute==

The Panyaro Institute for the Promotion of the Way of Tea was founded to perpetuate the lifelong work of the celebrated Korean Tea Master, the Venerable Hyodang, who devoted sixty years of his life to a study of the teachings of the great Korean spiritual master Wonhyo and to the elaboration of methods of using tea in meditation.

Hyodang contributed to the culture of tea in three major ways: First, he published the first Korean book consecrated to the Way of Tea, &quot;The Korean Way of Tea&quot;, a work that continues to inspire readers interested in Korean tea culture. Second, he transmitted the particular method of making the green tea known as Panyaro. 
Third, he founded the first association of Koreans interested in the study of tea, the &quot;Korean Association for the Way of Tea&quot;.

Hyodang was also the first to give ordinary readers an
awareness of the significance of the life of the Venerable Ch&#x27;o-ui, the early 19th century tea master, through a series of articles published in a popular newspaper. Just as Ch&#x27;o-ui led the revival of interest in tea in his time, so Hyodang led the modern revival.

In 1981 Chae Won-hwa launched what became the Panyaro Institute for the Promotion of the Way of Tea, and by November 1995 she had established a formal graduation ceremony for those who had completed the full course of study. Such ceremonies are now held each year.

<text>Achasanseong () is a Three Kingdoms-era earthen Korean fortress on the mountain Achasan, in Seoul, South Korea. Originally built by Baekje, it was occupied in turn by each of the Three Kingdoms. It is at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level. It has a perimeter of roughly 1 kilometer and an area of about 3375 m2.

The first mention of this fortress in historical records comes from the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;&#x27;s statement that King Chaekgye of Baekje ordered it to be fortified against an expected Goguryeo invasion. At that time, Achasanseong would have played a key role in the defense of the Baekje capital Hansŏng from the north.

In 475, Goguryeo overran this and the other defenses of Baekje, and King Gaero of Baekje was brought to Acha and executed. The fortress and the rest of the Han River valley were conquered by Silla in 553. The Goguryeo general Ondal later died here while trying to reclaim the fortress.

Achasanseong was designated as a historic landmark in 1973, and has since become a common local tourist destination.

<text>Commodore Jacob Nicholas Jones (March 1768 – August 3, 1850) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France, the First Barbary War, the Second Barbary War, and the War of 1812.

==Biography==
Jones&#x27; birthplace was on a farm about one mile northwest of the town of Smyrna, Delaware Colony. His father was a farmer of exemplary moral and religious character and his mother was of a family greatly respected. She died when he was an infant. His father soon followed her to the grave and at four years of age he was an orphan. It is not clear how he became a doctor. Educated in medicine and practicing as a doctor, he was later appointed as Clerk of the Delaware Supreme Court. He was married to Anna Matilda Sykes, daughter of James Sykes the 15th Governor of Delaware; she died before he joined the United States Navy.

===Midshipman===
Jones joined the United States Navy in 1799 at the age of 31, very old for the times, when a midshipman could be as young as 10. Some think he joined the Navy because of grief after the death of his wife. He spent 22 months as an acting midshipman.

===Lieutenant===
During the Quasi-War with France, he served under Commodore John Barry in the frigate and was commissioned a lieutenant February 27, 1801. First Barbary War:Jones was serving on USS Constellation in October, 1802 when he was arrested for aiding and abetting the murder of Marine Capt. James McKnight by Navy Lt. Richard H. L. Lawson in a duel on 14 October at Leghorn. Jones joined the crew of on May 24, 1803, as second lieutenant (2nd mate). On October 31, 1803, he was taken prisoner with the rest of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s crew by the Bey of Tripoli and held until liberated in June 1805.

===Master Commandant===

On April 20, 1810, Jones received promotion to master commandant, and on June 4, he took command of . In October 1812, Jones and &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed on an Atlantic cruise. On October 13 he captured the British 12-gun brig HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;.

Despite storm damage to his ship, he attacked a British convoy on October 18 and, following an intense battle, captured the Royal Navy sloop of war , in a fierce engagement. Both ships were seriously damaged and were captured by the 74-gun ship of the line . Still, Jones was widely admired among Americans and when he returned to the United States after an exchange of prisoners, he received a gold medal from the United States Congress.

===Captain===
Jones was promoted to the rank of captain in March 1813 and given command of the frigate . He spent time in Decatur&#x27;s squadron, which was bottled up at New London during 1814. Later, Captain Jones was sent to the Lake Ontario theater, where he commanded the frigate during the last year of the war.

During the second and final Barbary War, in 1815, Jones again commanded &quot;Macedonian&quot;. Service as captain of the frigate followed in 1816–1818.

===Commodore===
Jones was Commodore of the United States&#x27; squadrons in the Mediterranean in 1821–1823 and in the Pacific in 1826–1829. He was a Navy Commissioner in Washington, DC, between those tours at sea and held important commands ashore at Baltimore and New York during the 1830s and 1840s. He received his final assignment, as commandant of the Philadelphia Naval Asylum in 1847. Commodore Jacob Jones held that position until his death.

==Death and legacy==

Jones died on August 3, 1850, and is interred at the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware.

Three ships, USS &quot;Jacob Jones&quot;, have been named for him. Jones Island of Washington state is also named for Jones.

<text>Unreal Championship is a first-person arena shooter video game developed by Digital Extremes and Epic Games, published by Infogrames, and released for the Xbox. Part of the &quot;Unreal&quot; franchise, &quot;Unreal Championship&quot; is the console version of &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;, and was developed to take advantage of Xbox Live. The game is notable for being the first ever console game to receive a downloadable patch. In 2003 &quot;Unreal Championship&quot; was added to the Xbox &quot;Platinum Hits&quot; line.

In line with other online-enabled games on the Xbox, multiplayer on Xbox Live was available to players until 15 April 2010. &quot;Unreal Championship&quot; is now playable online again on the replacement Xbox servers called Insignia. 

A direct sequel, &quot;Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict&quot;, was released in 2005.

==Gameplay==
* Deathmatch
* Team Deathmatch
* Capture the Flag
* Double Domination: In this mode, both teams must control two points on the map for ten seconds in order to score. A point can be taken by walking into its symbol, A or B. NPCs can be ordered to go to a certain point.
* Survival: 1 vs 1 deathmatch with more players than usual. As each round ends, the losing player is made to join a queue of spectators, while the winner remains in the game until killed. The winner is the first player to reach a predetermined score.
* Bombing Run: The player&#x27;s team must score by placing the ball in the enemy force&#x27;s goal. The bombing gun regenerates health as the offensive player moves, giving him additional lifespan to reach the enemy goal. Once the enemy goal is reached, the offensive player can run into it to score seven points for their team. Shooting the bomb into the enemy goal earns three points.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Online Game&quot; and &quot;Best Shooter&quot; awards among Xbox games, both of which went to &quot;MechAssault&quot;.

<text>Jacqueline K. Barton (born May 7, 1952 New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a professor of chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the California Institute of Technology. In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and from 2009 to 2019, the Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor of Chemistry, Emerita.

Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science and the 2015 Priestley Medal.

==Early life and education==
Jacqueline Ann Kapelman was born on May 7, 1952, in New York City. Her father served in the Assembly for nearly a decade before serving as a trial judge in the New York Supreme Court next two decades. Her father was one of the trial judges in the Son of Sam serial murder case.

Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys&#x27; school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher. During her last year at Barnard she married first year medical student Donald J. Barton, receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.

She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard. While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy. She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing &quot;The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex: the interaction of antitumor platinum drugs and metallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids&quot;.

==Career and research==
After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells. Barton became a professor of chemistry at Hunter College from 1980 to 1982, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group. While at Hunter, she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later the interactions of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.

In the 1980s, she moved to Columbia University where she taught from 1983 to 1989. She became a full professor in 1986 and was the first woman to receive tenure in the chemistry department at Columbia. Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences. Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and &quot;turn off&quot; the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.

In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech, where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired. In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.

The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy. Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.

Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics. Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.

Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women. Recognized as a &quot;superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists&quot;, Barton advises others that &quot;the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science&quot;. She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997. She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.

Barton was a Member of the Board of Directors of Dow Chemical for more than twenty years. She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989–2008) and has been a member of Gilead&#x27;s Board of Directors since 2018.

In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech, who is also a National Medal of Science winner. She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth (born in 1991), and a stepson Andrew.

===Research summary===

Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.

==Awards and honors==
Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, &quot;For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer.&quot; Other awards include:

<text>Alexander Sokolov (1955–2022) was a direct-carving or &quot;taille directe&quot; marble sculptor. He spent time working and exhibiting in Ireland, France and Spain, which has led to the distribution of his more central continental style within Iberia. The book &quot;Sokolov&quot; by the renowned Basque poet and critic Marrodán is to be found at the libraries of the many Spanish universities and Royal Academies of Fine Art.

The sculptor studied and lived in the studios of Miklos Dallos at his outset in Paris in the mid-1970s. Sokolov was seen by Marrodán as emanating from the French school of sculpture and there is a chain of teaching influence through Miklos Dallos and Marcel Gimond back to Antoine Bourdelle and Aristide Maillol. Sokolov, who in French manner elicits response within the bare subject of the torso and the nude, as does Dallos, also has, like Gimond, a strength for portraiture.

That specification of sculpture as tension of force between the under-lying helicoidal axis and superposed rhythm of planes in Sokolov is tempered by the artist&#x27;s choice to work, free from preparatory modelling, in direct-carving. The modernism of the French school of sculpture developed in modelling but Sokolov&#x27;s direct-carving is informed by the revolutionary carving influences of Brâncuși and the later Henry Moore. As a portraitist, Sokolov is unusual as working by &quot;taille directe&quot;, but the helicoidal axis teaching shapes the majority of his large body of work in the human figure and nude. Such movement about the axis would be a continuation of the Italian art termed Mannerist.

Sokolov, who has worked between studios in Ireland and Olula del Rio in Spain, has exhibited seventeen one man shows in European cities.

<doc id="1166888" wikidata="Q1356968" url="?curid=1166888" title="Michael Rose (singer)">
<text>Michael Rose (born 11 July 1957) is a Jamaican reggae singer. He is most widely known for a successful tenure as the lead singer for Black Uhuru from 1977 to 1984, followed by a lengthy solo career. He has been praised as &quot;one of Jamaica&#x27;s most distinguished singers&quot; and for launching a distinctive form of reggae singing that originated in his home neighborhood of Waterhouse in Kingston.

==Career==
Rose began performing at talent contests and in the Jamaican hotel circuit as a teenager, and recorded his first single &quot;Woman a Gineal fe True&quot; at age 15 with producer Newton Simmons. Rose&#x27;s childhood friend Sly Dunbar then introduced him to producer Niney the Observer, with whom he recorded several singles in 1972. Rose also recorded a song with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry during this period.

Rose spent the next several years honing his songwriting. In 1977, Dunbar introduced him to Derrick &quot;Duckie&quot; Simpson, the leader of reggae group Black Uhuru. That group was undergoing a significant lineup change that also included the addition of singer Puma Jones. Rose became the group&#x27;s lead singer and primary songwriter, leading the group through seven studio albums, starting with &quot;Showcase&quot; in 1979 and also including the critically acclaimed &quot;Red&quot; in 1981 and the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Anthem&quot; in 1983. That album won the award for Best Reggae Album in 1985, the first year of that award&#x27;s existence.

Rose left Black Uhuru in 1985 after falling out with Simpson, and retired to the Blue Mountains in Jamaica to start a coffee farm. He released a string of singles in Jamaica, but nothing much was heard of him outside the island until 1989, when he signed with RCA and released the pop-influenced album &quot;Proud&quot; in Europe and Japan. The deal with RCA was short-lived however, and Rose returned to Jamaica to record a string of singles produced by Sly and Robbie. He also recorded for other producers but the only albums released during this period were the Japan-only &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1991) and &quot;King of General&quot; (1992). The singles from this period were eventually compiled on the album &quot;Sly and Robbie Presents: Mykall Rose – The Taxi Sessions&quot; in 1995. During that year he also signed with Heartbeat Records.

In the 1995–2004 period Heartbeat Records released a total of nine albums, and Rose regularly reached the singles charts in Jamaica and Europe. He rejoined Black Uhuru in 2004 for a multi-year tour under the name Black Uhuru featuring Michael Rose. During this period he continued to record and perform as a solo artist. In 2019 he released his first album in eleven years, the ska project &quot;Ska Ska Ska.&quot; His 2022 single &quot;Glory to Jah&quot; attracted media attention in Jamaica. 

In 2022, Rose began performing at festivals in the USA with Lee “Scratch” Perry’s former band Subatomic Sound System including appearances in 2023 at CaliVibes Fest, CaliRoots, the Marley Brothers’ KayaFest at Red Rocks, and in 2024 at KCRW’s Reggae at Night Hollywood Bowl. The album “Rockin’ Like a Champion” was released on July 26, 2024, a collaboration between Mykal Rose, Subatomic Sound System, and UK singer Hollie Cook put out jointly by the labels Dubshot &amp; Controlled Substance Sound Labs. David Rodigan premiered the album title track on BBC Radio 1Xtra.

In 2024, Rose began working with Kingmaker Music and industry veteran William Moseley on releasing new music with a focus on Afrobeat, Sound Tracks, and different fusion styles. The same year Rose received a third Grammy nomination for his work with The Wailers on their &quot;Evolution&quot; album which was nominated for Reggae Album of the Year at the 67th Grammy Awards. 

In 2025, Rose in collaboration with Moseley released &quot;We Must Pray&quot; a song dedicated to all that were effected by the Los Angeles fires. Each stream went to raise money for the Los Angeles Fire Department. 

==Name spelling==
His birth name in Michael Rose, and this name appears on most but not all of his solo albums. Starting in 1991 he changed the spelling to &quot;Mykal Rose&quot; claiming that this is the Ethiopian version of the name. He has also used various spellings including &quot;Mykal Roze&quot;, &quot;Mikal Rose&quot;, &quot;Michael Roze&quot;, and other minor variations.

<doc id="1166897" wikidata="Q1760261" url="?curid=1166897" title="Landstalker">
<text>is an action role-playing that was developed by Climax Entertainment and released for the Sega Genesis in 1992 in Japan and 1993 elsewhere. Players take on the role of the treasure hunter Nigel as he navigates a three-dimensional world through an isometric viewpoint, solving puzzles and fighting enemies.

The game was a critical and commercial success. A spinoff called &quot;Lady Stalker: Challenge from the Past&quot; was released in Japan for the Super NES in 1995. A sequel was in the planning stages but was cancelled. &quot;Dark Savior&quot; and &quot;Alundra&quot; are considered spiritual successors. Nigel is a playable character in &quot;Time Stalkers&quot;.

It has been re-released several times: on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2007, Steam in 2011, on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2023.

==Gameplay==
The player, as Nigel the treasure hunter, is tasked with searching for clues that lead to the treasure of King Nole. This is accomplished primarily by travelling through both outdoor areas and dungeons. All gameplay and plot-advancing scenes take place in an isometric view.

From the outset of the game, Nigel may walk, jump, swing his sword, climb ropes and ladders, talk to various non-player characters, and pick up and throw various objects. With very few exceptions, these basic actions do not change throughout the game, although Nigel&#x27;s weapons and armor may be replaced with better versions. There are a variety of items throughout the game, most of which either increase or restore health and attacking power or are important to advancing the plot or solving puzzles.

Much of the game&#x27;s dungeons and overworld are filled with monsters, mostly creatures from fantasy and mythology like ogres, skeletons, ghosts, golems, and more; many may be avoided or killed for gold or other collectables, while others must be killed to advance the plot and the game. Many traps and puzzles also appear requiring the player to jump from platform to platform press switches and move blocks to climb on. Locked doors inhibit the player&#x27;s progress, the player must find keys or beat enemies or puzzles to unlock them and progress further. Many dungeons and areas have a boss to defeat at the end. The monsters, puzzles and dungeons increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The player has health which is kept track of by hearts; health and the maximum health limit may be increased with items purchased in towns or found in dungeons. The player is not prevented from revisiting old towns and dungeons, and is frequently required to do so to advance the plot.

There are several optional side quests found in the game involving helping out the non-player characters. Nigel can complete these tasks for benefits, like increased attacking power and use of shortcut warps to travel across the overworld quicker. These can help the player but are not necessary to complete the game.

==Plot==

The game&#x27;s intro starts in Gamul Date 312 where Nigel, a treasure hunter who is 88 years old, far older than he appears, is shown traversing a dungeon of rolling boulders and moving platforms called Jypta Ruins to acquire the Statue of Jypta. After selling this statue to a shop owner in a port town of Kalva, Nigel is accosted by a wood nymph named Friday. She explains that she is being chased by three persistent yet bumbling thieves named Kayla, Ink, and Wally because she knows the location of the legendary treasure of King Nole. Once Nigel spends most of his money on a bird to carry him to the island, Friday admits that while she doesn&#x27;t know the exact location of the treasure she has a &quot;feeling&quot; where it is. The player controls Nigel from here on where he and Friday, who accompanies him for the entire game, first journey through a dungeon until they fall into a river and end up in the care of the red-furred bear-people of Massan. When Nigel awakes, he finds his way to the neighboring village of Gumi, where the yellow-furred bear-people are ready to sacrifice the daughter of Massan&#x27;s leader, Fara. Nigel follows the crazed tribe into their shrine and breaks them of their curse, freeing Fara and earning the respect of both tribes and a clue to help him to the treasure.

Nigel and Friday travel westward until they come to the lighthouse town of Ryuma which has been attacked by thieves. Nigel goes to the thieves&#x27; cave and rescues the mayor and some other men who have been kidnapped. He also finds a lithograph of a dragon, which Friday tells him is a clue to the treasure. Before he can leave, Kayla, Ink, and Wally show up and hold Friday hostage until Nigel hands them the lithograph.

Nigel&#x27;s heroics earn him a place in the court of Duke Mercator, who orders him to go and defeat an old wizard, Mir, who is locked in a tower nearby and who has been terrorizing the town and extorting the Duke. Nigel braves a crypt and the wizard&#x27;s tower and faces him in single combat. Defeated, Mir confesses all he knows about King Nole&#x27;s treasure and then explains that the Duke is his brother and had been using him as a scapegoat for years. Nigel returns to the Duke and is about ready to confront him when he is tossed into a dungeon. While imprisoned he finds out that the princess of Maple, his home country, who had been a guest at the castle, has been taken away by the Duke&#x27;s dragon-like henchman, Zak. He manages to escape to find the castle knights in open revolt and ships stuck in the harbour because the lighthouse in Ryuma is broken. Nigel saves Arthur, the Duke&#x27;s general, and is given the key to the Greenmaze, where the Sunstone can be found, the gem that powers Ryuma&#x27;s lighthouse.

Nigel navigates the maze despite the best efforts of troublesome gnomes and restores the lighthouse. He then takes a ship to pursue the Duke. He makes landing up the coast of the island at Verla, which has practically become a ghost town. The Duke had enslaved the population of the town and forced them to work in nearby mines searching for a legendary treasure. Nigel frees the townspeople, and they give him a legendary sword they found but had hidden from the Duke. Nigel continues through the mine to find the Duke sailing, via rafts, across a lake to an island temple. Nigel finds a way over and navigates through the labyrinth to fight the Duke but is caught off-guard by Zak. Nigel is teleported to safety by Mir before the Duke and Zak can finish him off. Mir then proceeds to give Nigel some more information about King Nole&#x27;s treasure. Mir also gives a magical axe to Nigel which allows him to cut down trees with a single swing of his sword.

Nigel retakes his sword in hand, and Friday leads him up through mountains to get to the entrance to the underground dungeon where King Nole hid his treasure. They encounter Zak again, who has decided that while he doesn&#x27;t like working for the Duke any longer he still wants to face Nigel one on one. After Nigel proves his superiority, Zak gives Nigel something he stole from the Duke that will allow Nigel to enter the underground. Zak departs defeated.

Nigel finds himself back at the same cave he started in, this time filled with monsters but no traps. He gets to the Duke just as he uses the Princess to open the gate between the above and below worlds (referencing the song In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida). Nigel charges through into the center of the island and into King Nole&#x27;s labyrinth, a massive confusing dungeon guarding King Nole&#x27;s palace. After making it through the labyrinth and the palace, Nigel makes it to the room which held the treasure. After all the challenges so far, things are not quite finished for King Nole&#x27;s restless Spirit attacks Nigel but Nigel makes quick work of him. The Duke then shows up and as he thanks Nigel for doing the dirty work for him, Gola, the Dragon God that King Nole worshipped, burns him alive.

Nigel fights Gola using all of his strength and cunning, and when the beast is finally vanquished, the treasure is his. With vast sums of gold under his control he decides that rather than retire he and Friday will continue their adventures. In the original ending in the Japanese and European version the treasure vanishes after Gola&#x27;s last stand. Nigel isn&#x27;t very upset and suggests taking Friday with him to the main country for new adventures.

==Reception==

The game was reviewed in 1995 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #217 by Jay &amp; Dee in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Jay gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. The game was praised in the Australian-based &quot;Megazone&quot; magazine, where it received a 9 out of 10. The game received extremely positive attention in &quot;GameFan&quot; magazine, getting reviewed twice, once for the import version, then again for the American release. The import review gave it a perfect 10 out of 10, stating that it was &quot;the perfect action/RPG&quot; and that if &quot;this was an American release, I would give it game of the year, it&#x27;s that good.&quot; According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Landstalker&quot; met with critical acclaim in Japan, and was a major system seller for the Mega Drive there.

In &quot;GameFan&quot;″s annual Megawards, &quot;Landstalker&quot; won the awards for Most Innovative New Game (Sega) and Best Action/RPG, and was a nominee for the Best Music (Genesis) and Game of the Year awards. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #5 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. Gamasutra included it as an example of an open world game as part of their Game Design Essentials series. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 24th on their: &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot;

<text>Red Hill is a suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The suburb is named after the northernmost hill of the ridge to the west of the suburb. The ridge is a reserve and managed as part of the Canberra Nature Park. The hill is an element of the central Canberra design axis.

==History==
The name &#x27;Red Hill&#x27; was gazetted as a suburb name in 1928. This was the name associated with the hill since the days of the early settlers and probably suggested by the red soil in the area. Streets are named after ships and explorers. Mugga Way is named after an Aboriginal word also associated with the locality since the days of the early settlers.

The hill was once part of the Narrabundah lease held by Charles Russell. He grazed sheep but as the suburb became built up, local pet dogs worried them and killed them. He changed to cattle and finally gave up the lease in 1992.

The Red Hill Precinct or &quot;Old Red Hill&quot; is bounded by Mugga Way, Moresby Street, Arthur Circle, Monaro Crescent and Flinders Way. The major streets of this area were included in an outline plan for the early development of Canberra prepared by Walter Burley Griffin in 1918. Its streetscape and landscape character reflect 1920s garden city planning. It is listed by the ACT Heritage Council.

Residential land in the suburb of Red Hill was offered for sale in the first Canberra land auction conducted on 12 December 1924. By 1929, 22 houses had been built and by 1955 there were 64 houses.

Other sites in Red Hill listed by the ACT Heritage Council are:

*Calthorpes&#x27; House.
*The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Headquarters, 2a Mugga Way, which was designed by Bryce Mortlock of the Sydney firm, Ancher, Mortlock and Woolley in 1967.
*The Canberra Grammar School, which was built between 1929 and 1939 in the Inter-war Gothic style.
*145 Mugga Way. According to the ACT Heritage Council, the house is considered to be an &quot;excellent example of the late twentieth century Sydney Regional style of architecture by Allen Jack+Cottier (Russell Jack) who are considered to be key practitioners in the style.&quot;
*Red Hill Camp. A Ngunnawal campsite from the 1940s at the intersection of Flinders Way, Durville Crescent and Hayes Crescent.

==Suburb amenities==
===Canberra Nature Park: Red Hill===

Red Hill&#x27;s most important recreational area is the hill itself. From the &quot;Canberra Times&quot; Letters to the Editor in May 2000 one resident said: 
:&quot;Most Sundays I walk on the slopes of Red Hill in bush that is not pristine, not especially beautiful, but that is there close to where I live, a bit of bush rather than town earth and rock, not bitumen. There is a variety of birds, a miscellany of trees, some of them exotics, a range of weedy but pretty flowers, no doubt snakes, and certainly kangaroos. Ironically, a month ago I saw more kangaroos (a mob of 14) on Red Hill in the centre of Canberra than I saw subsequently during the entirety of a 16-day tour of the Red Centre. This Red Hill bush it can&#x27;t be called wilderness makes Canberra a better place to live for the many people who do walk there and enjoy its qualities. &quot;

===Schools===
Red Hill has a local public primary school and a government pre school located in the same building complex. The Red Hill School is an accredited IB World School. There is also a Catholic primary school, St Bede&#x27;s Primary School, and the Canberra Grammar School, an Anglican school for boys and girls, and a French-Australian preschool.

Red Hill residents get preference for:
*Depending on the address: Red Hill Primary or Forrest Primary
*Telopea Park School (for high school)
*Narrabundah College

==Notable places==

===Calthorpes&#x27; House===

Calthorpes&#x27; House at 24 Mugga Way was built in 1927 by Harry Calthorpe, stock and station agent with the firm Woodgers &amp; Calthorpe. Designed by the architectural firm of Oakley and Parkes, the house displays many characteristics of the Spanish Mission style. The family (Harry, his wife Del and two daughters, Del and Dawn) lived together in the house throughout the Depression and Second World War, when both girls married. After Harry&#x27;s death in 1950, his wife continued to live in the house, mostly alone. While friends and neighbours redecorated their houses, she elder never did. After her death in 1979, it was recognised that an opportunity existed to preserve a house that related to Canberra&#x27;s early years in staggering completeness, and the Australian Commonwealth Government bought the house, its garden and the house&#x27;s contents from the two daughters in 1984.

The Australian Institute of Architects in its register of significant 20th-century architecture says the building is a rare, relatively unchanged example of a 1920s Australian home. Noting that it encapsulates family life of the time, it also points to the interior design and clinical appearance of the kitchen and bathroom, which &quot;heralded the new social era&quot;.

=== Boxford ===
A suburban garden named &quot;Boxford&quot; designed by Polly Park was divided into six separate sections, each reflecting the garden history and culture of a different part of the world. One of the gardens is in the Japanese style; another features a fountain inspired by chapel of Oscar Niemeyer in garden derived from the ideas of Burle Marx a Brazilian garden designer. The garden has been listed on the ACT Heritage Register, and it was featured in Burke&#x27;s Backyard.
Despite its heritage listing the garden was destroyed by new owners.

==Major roads==
The main access to the suburb from the south is from Hindmarsh Drive onto either Mugga Way or Dalrymple Street. The main roads through the suburb are La Perouse Street, Flinders Way and Monaro Crescent. The suburb&#x27;s roads are named after ships and explorers.

==Demographics==
The first families moved to the suburb of Red Hill in 1927 and by 1933 the suburb had a population of 132 people. Its population peaked in 1971 with 4,100 residents. At the , Red Hill had a population of 3,146, little changed from its population of 3,170 in 2016, 3,249 in 2011 and 3,143 in 2006 and 3,062 in 2001. The population number has changed little over the last 30 years: in 2001 there were 16 fewer people than in 1996; 32 more people than in 1991.

The median age was 42 years; an increase over the median age of 39 recorded in the 2006 census and 37 years recorded in both the 1996 and 1991 censuses.

The mean household size was 2.8 persons.

In the 2021 census, 79.1% of dwellings were separate houses, 7.3% were semi detached, row or terrace houses and townhouses and 13.4% were flats, units or apartments.

Of all occupied private dwellings in the 2021 census, 39.2% were fully owned, 35.8% were being purchased and 21.8% were being rented.

==Politics==

Red Hill is located within the federal electorate of Canberra, which is currently represented by Alicia Payne in the House of Representatives. In the ACT Legislative Assembly, Red Hill is part of the electorate of Murrumbidgee, which elects five members on the basis of proportional representation, currently two Labor, two Liberals and one independent. Polling place statistics are shown to the right for the &quot;Red Hill&quot; polling place at Red Hill School in the 2022 federal and 2024 ACT elections.

==Geography==

The Red Hill ridge forms the south-west boundary of the suburb. The ridge separates the central Canberra valley from Woden Valley. The northernmost peak is Red Hill, the Davidson Trig is on the middle point, and Mount Mugga is on the southernmost point of the ridge across Hindmarsh Drive.

The suburb occupies 4.87 km² and has a population density of 634/km².

== Geology ==

The Red Hill ridge is said by geologists to be an &quot;erosion residual&quot; resulting from metamorphisis of sedimentary rock. The &quot;Yarralumla Formation&quot; sediments were toughened by thermal metamorphism from a small granite intrusion to the south thereby providing the resistant core of the ridge. The granite is deeply weathered and does not outcrop but is evident by the smooth slopes and deep red soils on the lower slopes to the north-west by the road to the Federal Golf Course. This intrusion is known as Federal Golf Course Tonalite. It is dated at 417±8 Mya. It is completely crystalline with mineral content of plagioclase, hornblende, biotite and interstitial quartz and no potash feldspar.

The type of red soil is known as terra rossa.

===Rock location summary===
Mount Painter Volcanics dark grey to green grey dacitic tuff is found in all except the west. This includes most of the built up area. Yarralumla formation outcrops on Red Hill down to Mugga Way. The Federal Golf Course hanging off the west side of Red Hill also counts as part of the suburb. It has a Silurian tonalite intrusion under the whole course referred to as granite above.

<doc id="1166903" wikidata="Q2302060" url="?curid=1166903" title="Outlaws (1997 video game)">
<text>Outlaws is a first-person shooter developed and published by LucasArts on April 7, 1997. Set in the Wild West, it follows retired U.S. Marshal James Anderson, who seeks to bring justice to a gang of criminals who killed his wife and kidnapped his daughter. It uses an enhanced version of the Jedi game engine, first seen in &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot;. It is also largely credited as the first shooter game with a sniper zoom, as well as one of the first to feature a gun reloading mechanic. LucasArts&#x27; INSANE animation engine was used to render computer graphics animation sequences. These have special filters to look hand-drawn, and play between each mission and set up the action in the next area.

The game received generally favorable reviews from critics. While the graphics were often the topic of scrutiny and comparison to better looking titles of the time, such as &quot;Quake&quot;, reviewers were largely unanimous in praising the game&#x27;s orchestral soundtrack, composed by Clint Bajakian, and solid gameplay. The voice cast includes veteran talent such as Jeff Osterhage, Richard Moll and John de Lancie. A free expansion, entitled &quot;Handful of Missions&quot;, was released in 1998. Community-created expansion levels are also available and have received media coverage. Although not a huge financial success, the game has a cult following.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Outlaws&quot; is a first-person shooter. Players control the character as he utilizes several American Old West weapons and items, such as a rifle, shotgun, dynamite and revolver. The player can activate the lantern inventory item to lighten dark areas, and use a shovel in specific areas to dig holes. In the lower difficulty levels, termed Good and Bad, the player is able to sustain several bullet wounds with no apparent ill effects. In the hardest difficulty level, Ugly, the player&#x27;s resistance is reduced to one or two shots. This forces the player into a different style of play. Where on the easier difficulty levels a player might charge into a gunfight heedless of Anderson&#x27;s personal health, in Ugly mode, the player must use stealth and cover to win.

Aside from the main single player campaign, &quot;Outlaws&quot; includes a set of five discrete missions that chronicle Anderson&#x27;s rise to the rank of U.S. Marshal. Each of the missions requires Anderson to either capture or kill a specific outlaw. Ranks (Deputy, Sheriff, and Marshal) are awarded on the accumulation of a set number of points. Points are awarded for recovering stolen gold, capturing/killing the outlaw, and for killing enemies. Each outlaw that the player captures or kills appears in a jail cell in Anderson&#x27;s field office. More points are awarded for capturing an outlaw than for killing one, due to the difficulty in capturing one alive. Completion of the Historical Missions is not a requirement for playing the single player campaign.

&quot;Outlaws&quot; also features a multiplayer deathmatch in four variants, including a Kill the Fool with the Chicken mode. Multiplayer can be played over local area network, and it was one of the featured games on the MSN Gaming Zone before its demise. The player can assume the role of one of six characters from the main game: James Anderson, Matt &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Jackson, &quot;Bloody&quot; Mary Nash, Chief Two-Feathers, &quot;Gentleman&quot; Bob Graham, and &quot;Spittin&#x27;&quot; Jack Sanchez. Each character has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed/maneuverability, weapons selection, and resistance.

==Plot==
James Anderson, a retired U.S. Marshal, comes home after a trip to the general store to find his wife Anna dying and that his daughter Sarah has been kidnapped by two outlaws known as Matt &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Jackson and &quot;Slim&quot; Sam Fulton, under the employ of the railroad baron Bob Graham. Graham has hired several wanted outlaws to &quot;enlighten&quot; the people of the county to sell their land to him, so that he can make a profit off of a huge railroad. However, the psychotic Dr. Death misinterprets Graham&#x27;s meaning of enlightenment, attacks Anna and leaves her for dead, kidnaps Anderson&#x27;s daughter, and burns his home to the ground. After burying his wife, the retired Marshal picks up his gun once again and rides off to find his daughter. He travels around the old West, shooting his way through each member of Graham&#x27;s hired outlaws.

On his journey Anderson is haunted by dreams of his father&#x27;s murder as a child. He recalls that while the two were camping out in the wild, an unknown assailant shot his father in his sleep for no specific reason, but left young James alive, telling him &quot;to keep that fear [of death], kid&quot;. After questioning more and more outlaws, Anderson is confronted by Dr. Death in an old mine. Anderson eventually gets the drop on him; he gets tangled up in a rope above a deep mine shaft. Dr. Death tells him that his daughter is hidden in an old Indian cliff village. After finding out that Anderson is not going to let him out of the pit, he teases Anderson about the murder of his wife. Anderson is enraged and puts his cigar in the pulley from which the rope is hanging, eventually burning up the rope and sending Dr. Death plummeting to his demise at the bottom of the shaft.

At the Indian village, Anderson is ambushed by renegade Indian Two Feathers. After defeating him, Two Feathers praises Anderson&#x27;s strength in battle, and out of sympathy because he once had a child he had lost, tells him the real location of Sarah: Bob Graham&#x27;s estate, Big Rock ranch. Anderson blasts his way into Graham&#x27;s villa, and finally confronts him. After a fierce gunfight, Graham is believed dead and falls to the ground, and Anderson reunites with his daughter. Graham, clinging to life and gun trained on Anderson, reveals that he was the one who murdered Anderson&#x27;s father. Just as Graham is about to finish off Anderson, Sarah manages to shoot Graham with Anderson&#x27;s gun avenging her grandfather&#x27;s death. After a tearful reunion, father and daughter ride into the sunset.

==Development==

&quot;Outlaws&quot; is powered by an upgraded version of the Jedi engine, which was previously used on &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot;. LucasArts&#x27; INSANE animation engine is used to display the game&#x27;s cutscenes. The game was also originally planned to have 12 unique multiplayer characters, each with their own in-game attributes. The final release halved that number to six characters. The game was inspired by western films such as &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; and &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, as well as other Clint Eastwood westerns. It was released for Microsoft Windows on April 7, 1997. It is the first video game to feature a sniper zoom, and one of the earliest examples of a reloading mechanic. Despite the serious tone of the game, &quot;Outlaws&quot; maintained a few easter egg jokes, including Max of the Sam &amp; Max series, hidden inside a building, a pair of grey aliens experimenting on a cow, and several references to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series of games and movies.

In 1997, LucasArts released a patch to update the game to version 1.1 to add Glide and Aureal A3D, and another one to add Direct3D compatibility to the game in 2001, complementing the existing software rendering support. Shortly after the initial release, a small official expansion pack called &quot;Handful of Missions&quot; was released for free. It added four single player missions as well as multiplayer maps and updated the game to version 2.0. &quot;Outlaws&quot; is listed as one of noted game designer John Romero&#x27;s all-time favorite games. On March 19, 2015, Disney Interactive re-released the game for Digital distribution on GOG.com. In contrast, the community-created XL Engine allows players to use their original CD to play through the game with a modern setting.

In 1998, LucasArts released a set of four single player missions, called &quot;Handful of Missions&quot;, for download from the official website. The package includes several new multiplayer missions, and a patch to update the game to version 2.0. The single player missions take place outside of the original game&#x27;s story, and each level is unrelated to the next. Third party levels have been created by the game&#x27;s community. On April 5, 2013 GameSpot and several other media outlets organized a playthrough of several LucasArts games to honor the then recently closed developer. GameSpot staff noted that the &quot;community for [&quot;Outlaws&quot;] has created like 75 user generated maps.&quot; In reality more than 1,500 custom multiplayer maps have been created since &quot;Outlaws&quot; was released, and maps continued to be released until late 2012.

Music for the game was scored by composer Clint Bajakian. An orchestra was used with authentic instruments which was uncommon at that time. In total, Mixed Mode CD contains fifteen different audio tracks which were suitable for playback on a regular CD player. It is noteworthy that the crystal case of the game&#x27;s original release had a tracklist printed on its back side as it is the case with most normal audio CDs.

Several veteran actors lend their voices to the game. Richard Moll of &quot;Night Court&quot; plays the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Bob Graham. John de Lancie portrays Matt Jackson, the secondary antagonist. Veteran voice actor Jack Angel portrays two characters, George Bowers and Jack Sanchez. Jeff Osterhage, himself a veteran of western television films, voices the game&#x27;s protagonist, U.S. Marshal James Anderson.

==Reception==

&quot;Outlaws&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. It has been featured in multiple Best Of lists since its release. Complex.com writer Gus Turner included it in his list of The 25 Best LucasArts Games. Of its legacy Turner said it was not a &quot;major financial success, the title has only been able to attract a cult following since its release.&quot; Brittany Vincent of ShackNews placed it on her list of Five LucasArts Classics Ripe for Remakes, and noted that it &quot;deserves another chance to woo gamers.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Outlaws&quot; uses the &quot;Dark Forces&quot; engine, and it shows. The graphics are a bit outdated, a bit disorienting, and more than a bit pixelated in close. The game&#x27;s saving grace is its plot, admittedly and oft-overlooked aspect of this genre.&quot;

GameSpot reviewer Chris Hudak commended the game&#x27;s story and cinematic cutscenes, calling it a &quot;movie-worthy experience&quot; and citing the cinematic and musical influences of Sergio Leone&#x27;s spaghetti westerns and Ennio Morricone&#x27;s scores, respectively; he overall praised the game and called it &quot;the most complete and faithful Old West shooter in the industry to date&quot;. In a retrospective review of the game, Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett praised the game&#x27;s soundtrack and called the multiplayer &quot;excellent.&quot; Plunkett cited the release of the visually superior &quot;Quake&quot; a year earlier and &quot;Half-Life&quot; not long after as factors that led to the game fading into obscurity for most players. &quot;The Escapist&quot;&#x27;s Stew Shearer gave high marks for the game&#x27;s villains; he called them &quot;fun to hate.&quot; He stated that &quot;Outlaws&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t just Doom with cowboys; you can tell that the developers put some real hard work into making the player feel like they&#x27;re the hero in a Sergio Leone flick.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; noted that while the game did not look as visually appealing as its competitors, other developers should &quot;show as much thought in level and multiplayer design.&quot;

Some reviewers were more critical of the game. The reviewer for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with &quot;Outlaws&quot;. There just isn&#x27;t much right with it.&quot; The reviewer noted that the game had excellent music and art, but felt that the game had nothing new or innovative to offer players. &quot;Edge&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer stated that &quot;not for the first time, shown that it&#x27;s not infallible.&quot; Charlie Brooker of &quot;PC Zone (UK)&quot; had to take time to warm up to the game. &quot;when you start playing Outlaws, it feels downright cruddy.&quot; Brooker stated that after a lengthy amount of play his opinion changed, and ultimately he gave the game a favorable review.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the soundtrack for &quot;Outlaws&quot; its 1997 &quot;Musical Achievement&quot; award. During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 1st Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Outlaws&quot; was a finalist for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music&quot;, which ultimately went to &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;. In 2008 &quot;IGN&quot; selected the soundtrack from &quot;Outlaws&quot; to its &quot;10 Great Videogame Albums&quot; list.

<text>Nicholas Goldschmidt, (December 6, 1908 – February 8, 2004) was a Canadian conductor, administrator, teacher, performer, music festival entrepreneur and artistic director. He was the grand-nephew of famed composer Adalbert von Goldschmidt (1848-1906).

In 1937, Goldschmidt immigrated to the US, where he served as director of opera at the San Francisco Conservatory and Stanford University from 1938 to 1942. He was director of the opera department at Columbia University from 1942 to 1944. He subsequently moved to Toronto, where he served as the first music director of the Royal Conservatory Opera School (University of Toronto Opera Division) from 1946 to 1957. In 1950, Goldschmidt, Arnold Walter and Herman Geiger-Torel helped to found the Royal Conservatory Opera Company, which later became the Canadian Opera Company. From 1949 to 1957, Goldschmidt was the first music director of the CBC Opera Company.

In 1978, Goldschmidt was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and was promoted to Companion in 1989. In 1997, Goldschmidt received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

Goldschmidt married Shelagh Fraser on 26 June 1948.

<doc id="1166908" wikidata="Q2840597" url="?curid=1166908" title="Alvin Dark">
<text>Alvin Ralph Dark (January 7, 1922 – November 13, 2014), nicknamed &quot;Blackie&quot; and &quot;the Swamp Fox&quot;, was an American professional baseball shortstop and manager. He played fourteen years in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston/Milwaukee Braves (1946, 1948–49, 1960), the New York Giants (1950–1956), the St. Louis Cardinals (1956–1958), the Chicago Cubs (1958–59), and the Philadelphia Phillies (1960). Later, he managed the San Francisco Giants (1961–1964), the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics (1966–67, 1974–75), the Cleveland Indians (1968–1971), and the San Diego Padres (1977). He was a three-time All-Star and a two-time World Series champion, once as a player (1954) and once as a manager (1974).

Born in Oklahoma, Dark grew up in Lake Charles, Louisiana. He played baseball, basketball, and football at Louisiana State University before transferring to Southwestern Louisiana Institute to engage in officer training for the United States Marine Corps. After serving in the Marines in 1945 and 1946, he signed with the Braves, debuting with them later that year. He spent 1947 in the minor leagues, then was named the major leagues&#x27; 1948 Rookie of the Year after batting .322 for the Boston Braves. Following the 1949 season, he was traded to the Giants, who were looking to improve their speed and fielding. Named the captain by Giants manager Leo Durocher, he hit .300 or more three times while playing for the Giants, and became the first National League (NL) shortstop to hit 20 home runs more than once. He batted over .400 in the 1951 World Series and the 1954 World Series, the latter of which New York won by sweeping the Cleveland Indians. Traded to the Cardinals in 1956, Dark served as their starting shortstop through the beginning of the 1958 season, when his diminished range caused him to be shifted to third base. He spent most of 1958 and all of 1959 with the Cubs, then played for the Phillies and Braves in 1960 before retiring as a player. Dark had 2,089 hits in his career. Of the three shortstops in New York following World War II, Dark had a higher batting average and more home runs than Phil Rizzuto or Pee Wee Reese, despite the fact that he is the only one not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

Traded to the Giants after the 1960 season, Dark was named the team manager for 1961. Now playing in San Francisco, the Giants had a winning record each of Dark&#x27;s four years with them and reached the World Series in 1962, losing to the New York Yankees in a close seven-game contest. Dark became embroiled in controversy in 1964 after a &quot;Newsday&quot; article accused him of making racist comments, a claim denied by Dark, whose character was vouched for by Jackie Robinson. He was fired following the 1964 season, in which the Giants narrowly missed the pennant. After a year as the Cubs’ third base coach, he was hired to manage the Athletics in 1966. He only lasted two years with Kansas City before getting dismissed over a dispute with Charlie Finley about a player suspension. Hired to manage the Indians for 1968, Dark took on the dual role of general manager and field manager in 1969. The Indians finished third place in the American League (AL) in 1968 but had losing seasons the next three years, and Dark was fired in mid-1971 even though there were still two years remaining on his contract. Rehired to manage the Athletics in 1974, Dark became the third manager to win pennants in the NL and the AL. He led the team to its third straight World Series win and another playoff berth in 1975. During a church talk in 1975, he mentioned that Finley would be going to Hell if he did not accept Jesus Christ as his personal Savior, and the owner fired Dark after the season, saying he was &quot;too busy with church activities.&quot; Dark was hired one last time as a manager for San Diego in the middle of 1977. Finishing out the year with them, he hoped to be retained for 1978, but new general manager Bob Fontaine Sr. elected to go with Roger Craig, firing Dark in the middle of 1978 spring training. Following his managerial career, Dark held jobs as a minor league director for the Cubs and Chicago White Sox in the 1980s. He moved to Easley, South Carolina, in 1983, where he lived before dying of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2014.

==Early life==
Dark was born in Comanche, Oklahoma, the third-oldest of four children of Ralph and Cordia Dark. Ralph was a tool pusher for oil drillers. After living in Oklahoma and Texas, the Darks moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana, where Alvin spent much of his formative years. Malaria and diphtheria prevented Dark from being able to attend school until he turned seven, but by the time he reached high school, he was playing baseball, basketball, and football. As a tailback, Dark was an All-State and All-Southern player for Lake Charles High School, and he captained the basketball team as well. The school did not have a baseball team, but Dark played American Legion baseball in his teens. He was offered a basketball scholarship from Texas A&amp;M University, but he turned it down in favor of a baseball and basketball scholarship from Louisiana State University (LSU).

==College==
Dark was a member of Phi Delta Theta at LSU. During his sophomore year in 1942–43, he lettered in baseball, basketball, and football. Used as a halfback by the football team, he averaged 7.2 yards rushing, gaining 433 yards on 60 attempts. With World War II occurring, he transferred through the V-12 program to Southwestern Louisiana Institute (SLI, now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette), in order to train to be an officer in the United States Marine Corps. Playing tailback for the most successful football team in school history in 1943, he helped SLI to an undefeated season in 1943 and a New Year&#x27;s Day victory in the Oil Bowl. Against Arkansas A&amp;M College in the 24–7 victory, Dark ran for a touchdown, passed for another, and kicked a field goal as well as three extra points. Meanwhile, he batted .462 for the baseball team, also participating on the basketball and golf teams. Then, Dark went to Parris Island and Camp Lejeune, completing basic training for the Marines before getting sworn in as an officer at Quantico, Virginia, in 1945. He would ultimately complete his bachelor&#x27;s degree at SLI in 1947, after his professional baseball career had already begun.

==Military service==
After receiving his Marine commission, Dark was sent to Pearl Harbor to await assignment. He was briefly sent to Saipan to be part of a machine-gun outfit, but after one day, he was sent back to Pearl Harbor because the military wanted him on the Marine Corps football team. In December, after the war was over, he was sent to China, where he helped support the Nationalist forces in the Chinese Civil War by guarding a supply station 45 miles south of Peking and transporting supplies to another station. Dark spent four months doing this, but he and his squad did not realize that one of the towns they passed through was Communist-controlled. &quot;A month after I got back to the States, I received word that the Marines who took our place were ambushed in the Communist town and massacred,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography.

Upon his return to the States in 1946, Dark discovered he had been drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1945 NFL draft. He preferred baseball over football, however, and Ted McGrew, a scout for the Boston Braves, was impressed with Dark&#x27;s &quot;tenacity and competitive spirit in all sports,&quot; according to Eric Aron of the Society for American Baseball Research. Dark signed a $50,000 contract with the Braves on July 4, 1946, joining them 10 days later when his military service ended.

==Baseball career==
===Player===
====Boston Braves (1946, 1948–49)====
Dark&#x27;s Major League Baseball (MLB) debut came on July 14, 1946, when he was used as a pinch runner for Don Padgett in a 5–2 loss in the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 8, he had his first hit, doubling against Lefty Hoerst as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Braves by a score of 9–8. Used strictly as a reserve player and only about once every five games, Dark made only 15 appearances for the Braves in 1946, getting three hits (all doubles) in 13 at bats.
In 1947, Dark hoped to be the Braves&#x27; starting shortstop, but manager Billy Southworth elected to go with the veteran Sibby Sisti at the position. Dark was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers, an American Association team that was the Braves&#x27; top affiliate, for the only season he would spend in the minor leagues. As the starting shortstop for the Brewers, he was named an All-Star and Rookie of the Year, finishing third in American Association Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. Dark led the league in runs scored (121) and doubles (49), also ranking among the league leaders in hits (186, third behind John Douglas&#x27;s 195 and Bud Stewart&#x27;s 189) and stolen bases (14, tied with Charlie Ray for ninth). He batted .303 with 10 home runs and 66 runs batted in (RBI). Defensively, though he led the league in errors, he earned a reputation for steady play at the shortstop position.

Though he was not called up in 1947, Dark made the Braves&#x27; Opening Day roster in 1948 as a reserve infielder, as Sisti was still the starting shortstop – but this would soon change. &quot;First I got cut up on a takeout at second base, and that knocked me out of the lineup for a couple of weeks,&quot; Sisti said. &quot;Dark went in, and he didn&#x27;t do too well. Then I went in and I didn&#x27;t do too well, so they put Dark back in. This time he clicked, and he stayed there the rest of the year.&quot; In just his second game of the year, the second half of a doubleheader against the New York Giants, Dark had a season-high three RBI despite not entering the game until the third inning. By June, Dark and second baseman Eddie Stanky were showing their skill at turning double plays together. From June 20 through July 11, Dark had a 23-game hitting streak, three short of Guy Curtright&#x27;s record for rookies. During that streak, he hit his first major league home run, against Elmer Singleton in a 12–3 win over the Pirates. In his first full major league season, Dark ranked among the NL leaders in batting average (.322, fourth), hits (175, fifth), and doubles (39, third behind Stan Musial&#x27;s 46 and Del Ennis&#x27;s 40). He scored 85 runs, hit three home runs, and had 48 RBI. Dark was named the MLB Rookie of the Year in 1948, the second winner of the award (after Jackie Robinson) and the last winner before the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) started giving separate awards for the best rookie in the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). Dark also finished third in MLB MVP voting in 1948 after playing a vital part of the Braves&#x27; run to the pennant, their first since 1914. He struggled in the World Series, though, hitting only .167 as the Braves dropped the World Series to the Cleveland Indians, four games to two. In Game 3, he committed an error that allowed Gene Bearden to score the first run of the game in a 2–0 loss to the Indians.

Dark remained the Braves&#x27; starting shortstop in 1949. He had four hits on May 13 in a 10-inning, 6–5 win over the Brooklyn Dodgers. On May 18 and May 21, he had three-RBI games, in a 13–9 loss to the Cincinnati Reds and an 8–2 victory over the Pirates. On July 9, he had to be carried off the field after being hit in the head by a throw from Granny Hamner, but he was not seriously injured. He had two hits and three RBI on August 20, in a 4–0 victory over the Dodgers. In 130 games (529 at bats), Dark batted .276 with 74 runs scored, 146 hits, three home runs, and 53 RBI. He finished 25th in MVP voting after the season.

After winning the pennant in 1948, the Braves fell to fourth place in the league, with a 75–79 record. The New York Giants, the fifth place team, were looking to become a more multidimensional team by trading some of their power hitters for faster players that were better at defense. On December 14, the Braves traded Dark and Stanky to the Giants for Sid Gordon, Willard Marshall, Red Webb, and Buddy Kerr. Giants fans were initially disappointed at the deal, as Gordon was a fan favorite and Stanky was notorious for having excelled with the Giants&#x27; rivals, the Dodgers.

====New York Giants (1950–1956)====
Upon joining the Giants, Dark was immediately named team captain by manager Leo Durocher, a surprise to many sportswriters, who had speculated that the more veteran Stanky would get the role. An Associated Press article two years later called the move &quot;smart,&quot; speculating that Durocher had made the decision because he expected the younger Dark to be with the club longer than Stanky. Dark said, &quot;I think Leo chose me because he knew Stanky would be the way he was regardless, and he wanted me to develop more of that brashness Stanky had and Leo loved.&quot; In the first game of a doubleheader against the Reds on May 20, 1950, Dark had four hits in an 8–0 victory. He hit a three-run home run against Bud Podbielan in the second game of a doubleheader against the Dodgers on July 4, but that was all the scoring for the Giants as they lost 5–3. On July 23, against the Chicago Cubs in Game 2 of a doubleheader, he had a home run and a two-RBI single against Johnny Schmitz as the Giants won 3–0. In the second game of a doubleheader versus the Cubs on August 2, he had a bases-clearing triple against Johnny Klippstein and an RBI-sacrifice fly against Doyle Lade as the Giants won 8–6. On September 9, his home runs against Preacher Roe were the only scores in a 2–0 win over the Dodgers. In 154 games, Dark batted .279 with 79 runs scored, 164 hits, 16 home runs, and 67 RBI. His nine stolen bases tied with Stanky&#x27;s total for eighth-best in the NL.

In May 1951, Dark had four-RBI games on the first, the fifth, and the ninth, racking up four hits in each of the latter two contests; the Giants won each of the games. He had his third four-hit game of the month on May 25, adding two RBI in an 8–5 victory over the Phillies. Against the Cubs on June 9, Dark hit a three-run home run in the fourth-inning against Paul Minner, then delivered the second of back-to-back home runs off Bob Schultz in the fifth inning (with Stanky) as the Giants won 10–1. Dark made the NL All-Star team for the first time in 1951. Selected as the starting shortstop over Pee Wee Reese, he had a hit against Fred Hutchinson in the NL&#x27;s 8–3 victory. In an 8–5 win over the Phillies on August 17, Dark again had four hits, this time scoring three runs. During Game 2 of a doubleheader against the Braves on September 5, he had four hits in a 9–1 victory. On September 16, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Pirates at Forbes Field, he had four hits, including an inside-the-park home run against Bill Werle as the Giants won 6–4. In 156 games, Dark had 14 home runs and 69 RBI. He led the NL with 41 doubles and also ranked among the league leaders in batting average (.303, eighth), runs scored (114, fourth, behind Musial&#x27;s and Ralph Kiner&#x27;s 124 and Gil Hodges&#x27;s 118), hits (196, fourth, behind Richie Ashburn&#x27;s 221, Musial&#x27;s 205, and Carl Furillo&#x27;s 197), and stolen bases (12, tied with teammate Monte Irvin for eighth). Although he led NL shortstops with 45 errors, Dark also led in putouts (295), assists (465) and double plays (114). Dark finished 12th in MVP voting after the season.

Tied with the Dodgers at the end of the season, the Giants played a three-game tie-breaker series with Brooklyn to determine the NL pennant winner. In the deciding Game 3, with the Giants trailing 4–1 in the ninth inning, Dark led off with a single against Don Newcombe. As Dark recalled, &quot;I must have fouled off six or seven pitches with two strikes before getting that hit.&quot; He then scored three batters later on a Whitey Lockman double. Bobby Thomson followed with the Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World, a three-run home run against Ralph Branca that clinched the pennant for the Giants. In Game 1 of the 1951 World Series against the New York Yankees, Dark hit a three-run home run against Allie Reynolds, helping the Giants to a 5–1 victory. He had an RBI single against Vic Raschi in Game 3, which the Giants won 6–2. In Game 4, he had three doubles, though the Yankees won that game 6–2. Ultimately, Dark had a hit in every game of the series, batting .417, but the Giants fell to the Yankees in six games.
The following year, 1952, Dark picked up where he&#x27;d left off. He had three hits and two runs scored, including a home run against Howie Pollet, on June 8, 1952, in a 9–1 victory over the Pirates. On June 29, he had three runs scored, three hits, and three RBI in a 12–3 victory over the Phillies. For the second year in a row, he was selected to the All-Star Game, though he did not play this time because Hamner started for the NL, and Durocher (the manager) let all the starting players (except the pitcher) play the whole game. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cubs on July 30, his eighth inning three-run home run against Bob Rush gave the Giants three insurance runs in their 10–6 victory. He had three hits in each of three wins in a row over the Pirates on August 26, 27, and 28. On September 24, he had five hits and three runs scored, including a home run against Sheldon Jones as the Giants defeated Boston 11–8 in the first game of a doubleheader. In 151 games, Dark had 14 home runs and 73 RBI. He was seventh in the NL in runs scored (92), fourth in hits (177, behind Musial&#x27;s 194, Red Schoendienst&#x27;s 188, and Bobby Adams&#x27;s 180), eighth in doubles (29, tied with Eddie Waitkus and Thomson), and seventh in batting average (.301). Though he lost Stanky as a double play partner (the second baseman had been traded to the Cardinals before the season), Dark still led the NL with 116 double plays turned as shortstop, now working with Davey Williams at second base. He also led the NL in putouts for the second straight year, with 324.

Entering the 1953 season, the Giants considered shifting Dark to second base, with Williams and Daryl Spencer the candidates to be the new Giants shortstop. After having made $25,000 the year before, Dark held out at the beginning of spring training, seeking a higher salary for 1953, as Reese of the Dodgers had made $40,000 the year before. On March 3, he and the Giants finally agreed on a two-year-contract that reportedly paid somewhere between $30,000 annually (what the Giants had wanted) and $35,000 annually (what Dark had wanted). Once spring training was underway, there were reports that Dark was playing indifferently at second base, hoping to force the team to move him back to shortstop. Durocher held a press conference at his hotel room to address the rumors on March 20, and Dark barged in as it was going on. &quot;I have told Leo I will play second, third, or anywhere else he wants me to if he thinks it will improve the club,&quot; Dark said, and Durocher concurred that there was no ill feeling between him and Dark. John Drebinger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; doubted that Dark had played indifferently, noting that his worst day as a fielder in spring training occurred in a game in which he was playing shortstop, a game he had insisted on playing even though he was &quot;not feeling well&quot; that day.

Dark began the season at the shortstop position. Durocher shifted him to left field on June 21, then to second base on June 25, as Spencer began to get time at short. He scored four runs and had three RBI in a 20–6 victory over Brooklyn on July 5, including a two-run home run against Clem Labine. After spending much of July playing second base, Dark was shifted back to shortstop for the rest of the season on July 29, as Spencer&#x27;s batting average had been low the past month. On August 26, he had five hits and five RBI, including a two-run home run against Harvey Haddix in a 13–4 victory over the Cardinals. He had back-to-back four-hit games in victories over the Cubs on August 31 and September 1. With the Giants out of playoff contention at the end of the 1953 season, Dark convinced Durocher to let him do something he had always wanted to do in the major leagues: pitch. Originally scheduled to throw the first two innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 27, Dark completed only the first, giving up two runs before getting replaced by Ruben Gomez. Dark got a no decision, but the Giants lost 6–4. In 155 games, Dark batted .300 with 88 RBI. He led the NL in at bats (647) and ranked among the leaders in runs scored (126, third, behind Duke Snider&#x27;s 132 and Musial&#x27;s 127), hits (194, fourth, behind Ashburn&#x27;s 205, Musial&#x27;s 200, and Snider&#x27;s 198), and doubles (41, second to Musial&#x27;s 53). His 23 home runs were a record for NL shortstops at the time, though Ernie Banks would break it two years later by hitting 44.

Spencer departed to serve in the United States Army in 1954, leaving the shortstop position unquestionably Dark&#x27;s. He had five hits, two runs scored, and two RBI, including a home run against Rush, on May 14 in a 9–6 victory over the Cubs. On June 3, he had four hits and scored five runs in a 13–8 victory over the Cardinals. He had four hits against Cincinnati the next day, then had back-to-back four-hit games again against the Milwaukee Braves on June 8 and 9. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Phillies on July 5, Dark had four hits, three runs scored, and an RBI in a 10–0 victory. On July 10, he hit a grand slam against Max Surkont, but the home run came in a 10–7 loss to Pittsburgh. He was the starting shortstop in the All-Star Game, recording a single against Bob Keegan in the NL&#x27;s 11–9 loss to the AL. On August 6, he hit a solo home run against Gene Conley of the Braves. An irate Conley returned to the Braves&#x27; dugout and thundered, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna get that ––––. I&#x27;m gonna part his hair for that. That ––– is hitting me too good.&quot; Next time Dark batted, Conley threw a pitch towards his chin, leaving Dark face first on the ground as the hitter dove out of the way. His last time at bat that night, Dark hit another home run against Dave Jolly, but the Giants lost to the Braves by a score of 6–5. He had four-hit games on August 14 and September 1, but these both came in losses. In 1954, he batted .293 and was fifth in the MVP voting as the Giants won the pennant. He had 98 runs scored, 26 doubles, and 70 RBI. Dark led the NL in at bats (644) as well as games (tied for first with 154) and also finished seventh in hits (189). His 20 home runs made him the first NL shortstop to hit at least 20 home runs in multiple seasons. Defensively, though he led the league in errors (36), he provided solid play at the shortstop position.

In the 1954 World Series, the Giants faced the Cleveland Indians, who had set an AL record with 111 wins. Dark batted .412 with a hit in every game. He had three hits and scored two runs in Game 4 as the Giants pulled off the sweep to win their first championship since 1933. In the World Series parade, Dark rode in the first car with Willie Mays in front of 500,000 parade-goers in New York City.

On April 23, 1955, the Giants were playing the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. Sal Maglie had been throwing brushback pitches past the heads of several Brooklyn hitters, and irritated third baseman Jackie Robinson took revenge by hitting Williams with a shoulder block as he charged into first base in the fourth inning. Williams was knocked unconscious and had to be taken off the field on a stretcher, and Dark attempted to fight Robinson. Both benches cleared, but umpire Tom Gorman kept Dark from doing anything more than yelling. Between innings, Dark conferred with his teammates and issued a challenge: &quot;Somebody&#x27;s got to get him.&quot; It was decided that the first runner to reach third base would be charged with this task. Next inning, Dark got a hit against Carl Erskine and ran hard into Robinson at third base. The two exchanged words again, but umpire Babe Pinelli kept things from getting out of hand. On the following day, with the Giants trailing Brooklyn 5–3 in the ninth, Dark hit a two-run home run against Billy Loes to tie the game; the Giants won the next inning 11–10. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Cubs on May 15, Dark had four hits and scored two runs in a 9–4 victory. He hit a three-run home run against Murry Dickson on July 7 in an 8–5 victory over the Phillies. In the second game of a doubleheader against Cincinnati on August 7, Dark hurt his rib after colliding with first baseman Ted Kluszewski. He thought the injury was a bruise and tried to play again on August 14, but he had to leave that game early and was later diagnosed with a broken rib. The injury kept him out until September 1, but he only played two games upon his return before he tripped over a base in a game against the Phillies on September 2, separating his shoulder. That injury kept him out the rest of the season. Together, the injuries cost Dark 40 games. In 115 games, Dark batted .282 with 77 runs scored, 134 hits, 20 doubles, nine home runs, and 45 RBI. After the season, Dark was awarded the first Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, given to the player who best exemplified Gehrig&#x27;s character and integrity both on and off the field.

Recovered from his injuries by 1956, Dark was back in the lineup for Opening Day. He batted .364 in April but only hit .222 in his next 37 games, through June 15. That June, the Giants were searching for a second baseman. Meanwhile, the Cardinals wanted a shortstop and also desired to trade second baseman Red Schoendienst, as prospect Don Blasingame seemed ready to take over the position and St. Louis wanted to trade the veteran before his skills declined. On June 14, Dark, Lockman, Ray Katt, Don Liddle, and cash were traded to the Cardinals for Schoendienst, Bill Sarni, Dick Littlefield, Jackie Brandt, and two players to be named later (eventually Bob Stephenson and Gordon Jones). In 48 games with the Giants, Dark batted .252 with 19 runs scored, 52 hits, two home runs, and 17 RBI.

====Later years (1956–1960)====

Facing the Giants on July 12, 1956, Dark hit a seventh-inning sacrifice fly against Marv Grissom to snap a 3–3 tie in a 5–3 victory. The next day, Dark had four hits and three RBI, including a tie-breaking two-run double in the eighth inning against Hoyt Wilhelm as the Cardinals defeated New York by a score of 7–5. In the third game of the series, he had three RBI in a 5–2 victory. Then, in the first game of a July 15 doubleheader against Philadelphia, he had three hits, two runs scored, and four RBI in St. Louis&#x27;s 9–1 victory. On September 14, Dark had four hits and scored three runs, including a two-run home run against Mike McCormick, in a 9–4 victory over the Giants. In 100 games for St. Louis, Dark batted .286 with 54 runs scored, 118 hits, four home runs, and 37 RBI. His combined totals between the Giants and the Cardinals were a .275 batting average, 73 runs scored, 170 hits, 26 doubles, six home runs, and 54 RBI.

By 1957, Dark&#x27;s range was not as wide as it once had been; the season would be his last as a shortstop. &quot;I got by knowing the hitters, knowing where to play, what to look for,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography. He hit only four home runs in 1957, three of which came against the Giants. In Game 1 of a doubleheader against Cincinnati on May 30, he had three RBI in a 7–2 victory. On June 11, he had four hits and an RBI in a 5–2 victory over the Phillies. He had four hits, two runs scored, and an RBI on July 3 in a 5–4 victory over the Cubs. On July 31, he had four hits and two RBI in a 5–1 victory over the Giants. He had three RBI in a 10–1 victory over the Braves on September 1. In 140 games, Dark batted .290 with 80 runs scored, 169 hits, 25 doubles, and 64 RBI. Despite his diminished range, he led the NL in putouts (276) and double plays (105) for the third time.

Late in 1958 spring training, Dark had to be removed from a game after getting hit by a pitch from Dick Donovan, but he was back in the lineup by Opening Day. He started the year at shortstop but, after making two errors in his first four games, was moved to third base in favor of Ducky Schofield. After batting .297 in 18 games, Dark was traded to the Cubs on May 20 for Jim Brosnan.

After the trade to the Cubs, Dark continued to play third base, as Banks was the shortstop. He had three hits, three RBI, and a run scored on May 23 in an 11–4 victory over the Phillies. On June 20, he had four hits and three RBI in an 11–3 victory over Cincinnati. Two days later, in the second game of a doubleheader against Cincinnati, he had two hits and three RBI in an 8–6 victory. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Phillies on July 13, he had four hits and scored both Cub runs in a 2–1 victory. His two-RBI single against Don Erickson in the 10th inning on September 16 snapped an 8–8 tie in a 10–8 victory over the Phillies. In 114 games with the Cubs, Dark batted .295 with 54 runs scored, 137 hits, 16 doubles, three home runs, and 43 RBI. He played 132 games combined for both teams, batting .295 with 61 runs scored, 156 hits, 16 doubles, four homes runs, and 48 RBI.

In 1959, Dark remained at third base. He had three hits, scored three runs, and had two RBI on May 13 in a 10–0 win over Cincinnati. On June 30, in a game against the Cardinals, Dark had a role in one of baseball history&#x27;s most unusual plays. Musial was at the plate, with a count of 3–1. Pitcher Bob Anderson threw a wild pitch that evaded catcher Sammy Taylor and rolled all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, but Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the ball. As the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial decided to try to advance to second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. A ball boy had tossed it towards field announcer Pat Pieper, who was in charge of holding baseballs for the umpire, but Dark picked it up before it could get to Pieper. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson&#x27;s throw flew over Tony Taylor&#x27;s head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to Banks. Musial did not see Dark&#x27;s throw and tried to go to third base, having seen Anderson&#x27;s ball fly over the second baseman&#x27;s head. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay, Musial was ruled out. Still, the Cardinals won the game by a score of 4–1.

Dark hit only six home runs in 1959, three of which came in consecutive games from August 11–13. In the third, on August 13, the home run was a grand slam against McCormick in a 20–9 victory over the Giants. His two-run double against Jack Sanford provided the only runs for Chicago in a 2–1 victory over the Giants on September 4. On September 26, he hit a three-run home run against Podres in a 12–2 victory over the Dodgers. In 136 games, he batted .264 with 60 runs scored, 126 hits, 22 doubles, a career-high nine triples, and 45 RBI.

On January 11, 1960, Dark was traded with John Buzhardt and Jim Woods to the Phillies in exchange for Ashburn. &quot;Trades tell you exactly which side of the hill you&#x27;re on,&quot; he wrote in his 1980 autobiography, contrasting this deal with the trade that sent him and Stanky to New York, where four players were given up for those two. He began the year as Philadelphia&#x27;s starting third baseman. Facing the Braves in the second game of the year, on April 14, he notched his 2,000th hit, a single against Don McMahon in a 10-inning, 5–4 victory. He hit back-to-back home runs against the Dodgers on May 6 and 7. After hitting .242 in 55 games, Dark was traded back to the Braves (now in Milwaukee) on June 23 for &quot;Walpole&quot; Joe Morgan (not to be confused with the Hall of Famer of the same name). With Milwaukee, Dark served as a pinch hitter and utility player. In September, he got most of the starts for the Braves in left field. He appeared in his last major league game on October 2, playing left field in a 9–5 loss to Pittsburgh. Dark hit .298 in 50 games for Milwaukee. In 105 games combined between the teams, he batted .265 with 45 runs scored, 90 hits, 11 doubles, four home runs, and 32 RBI.

After the season, Braves manager Charlie Dressen told Dark that if he returned for the 1961 season, &quot;you&#x27;ll be my utility infielder-outfielder.&quot; To Dark, playing the game was becoming more of an occupation than a joy, and he feared being sent to the minor leagues. Rather than try to hang on another year as a player, he decided to retire. Over a 14-year major league career, Dark recorded a .289 career batting average, 2,089 hits, 358 doubles, 126 home runs, 1,064 runs scored, and 757 RBI over 1,828 games played. Defensively, he recorded a .959 fielding percentage.

===Manager===
Dark was traded back to the Giants (who had moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season) for Andre Rodgers on October 30, 1960, a move made so the team could hire Dark as their new manager. Giants owner Horace Stoneham tried to fill coaching vacancies with former Giants players, rewarding loyalty to the organization. Upon becoming manager of the Giants, one of the first things Dark did was rearrange the team&#x27;s locker assignments so that players were no longer grouped by race. Tex Maule of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote in May 1961, &quot;the Giants are no longer a conglomerate of stars, divided roughly along color lines, with no sense of being a team.&quot; During a fit of rage following a 1–0 loss to the Phillies on June 26, Dark threw a metal stool against the wall, then realized he&#x27;d lost part of the tip of his little finger. &quot;I made up my mind two weeks ago not to take my anger out on the players. So, I guess I took it out on myself tonight,&quot; he quipped. In his first year as manager of the Giants, Dark oversaw a team that finished third in the NL with an 85–69 record.

During the 1962 season, the Giants battled the Dodgers for the NL pennant, as both teams occupied the top two spots in the league starting May 10. One sore spot in the rivalry concerned infield dirt. The Dodgers used to pack the dirt at Dodger Stadium tightly, creating a hard infield that made it easier for Maury Wills, who would steal 104 bases in 1962, to run on. When Dark&#x27;s complaints fell on deaf ears, he decided to get revenge at Candlestick Park. Before a Dodger series with three weeks to go in the season, Dark had the groundskeepers soak the infield around first base; the muddy soil prevented anybody from getting enough of a foothold to steal bases. For the incident, Dark earned the nickname &quot;The Swamp Fox.&quot; The Dodgers had a four-game lead with seven games to go in the season, but San Francisco pulled into a tie on the final day of the season, necessitating another tie-breaker series. Prevailing in three games, the Giants faced the Yankees in the World Series. In a nailbiter, the teams forced the series all the way to its maximum seven games, with the Giants losing 1–0 in the series finale after Bobby Richardson snared a Willie McCovey line drive that likely would have won the series for the Giants had it been a hit.
Dark had a rocky relationship with Orlando Cepeda, one of the Giants&#x27; most popular players. During 1963 spring training, while Cepeda was refusing to play in hopes of getting a higher-paying contract, Dark revealed to the press that he had a point system by which he rated the players. When asked about Cepeda, Dark responded, &quot;He&#x27;s got more minuses than anybody.&quot; &quot;It may have been unfair for me to bring it up,&quot; Dark admitted later. The two squabbled over the next two seasons about Cepeda&#x27;s supposed lack of hustle, with the player blaming a sore knee. In 1963, the Giants had a winning record all season but did not fare quite as well as in 1962, winning 11 fewer games and finishing 11 games behind the Dodgers for the pennant.

In 1964, Dark named Willie Mays the captain of the Giants, making Mays the first African-American captain in Major League Baseball. &quot;You should have had it long before this,&quot; Dark told the player. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported on July 6 that Stoneham was thinking of firing Dark amidst rumors that the two were not speaking. Dark later wrote in his autobiography that his relationship with Stoneham had been rocky ever since Stoneham discovered in 1963 that the manager was having an affair. &quot;You can&#x27;t handle your ball players if you can&#x27;t handle yourself,&quot; he had told Dark. &quot;You&#x27;ve got rules you are breaking.&quot; On July 23, Dark became embroiled in controversy when Stan Isaacs of &quot;Newsday&quot; quoted him as saying the number of black and Hispanic players on the team was a source of trouble: &quot;They are just not able to perform up to the white player when it comes to mental alertness.&quot; Dark responded that he had been severely misquoted; Mays, whom he had named as team captain, met with several of the black and Hispanic players at the Carlton House in Pittsburgh (where the Giants were on a road trip) and calmed the team, reminding them that their best chance of winning came if Dark remained the manager the rest of the year. &quot;I have known Dark for many years, and my relationships with him have always been exceptional,&quot; said Jackie Robinson. &quot;I have found him to be a gentleman and, above all, unbiased.&quot; Dark considered suing the paper, but decided not to after he was told that &quot;Newsday&quot; would respond by publicizing his affair with Jackie Troy, an airline stewardess. &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be prejudiced if you are accused of it,&quot; Dark later wrote in his autobiography. &quot;The accusation convicts you every time.&quot; The Giants were contenders for the pennant most of the season, and they ended the year just three games out of first place; however, in 1964, that was fourth place in a close three-way race. Stoneham fired Dark during the sixth inning of the last game of the season, after the Giants had been eliminated from playoff contention.

After his dismissal from the Giants, Dark became a third base coach for the Cubs in 1965. He made it clear to the general manager John Holland that he was not interested in becoming the Cubs&#x27; manager, as he found the notion of coaching under a current manager while being readied to replace him &quot;offensive.&quot; With a month to go in the season, Dark was hired as an assistant to Kansas City Athletics owner Charlie Finley. After the season, he was named manager of the last-place Athletics, who had lost 103 games in 1965. The ballclub lost 14 of its first 17 games in 1966 but was one game under .500 for the rest of the year, resulting in a 15-game improvement and a seventh-place finish in the ten-team American League. As the season progressed, Dark made sure he utilized the young starting pitchers to get them experience; entering the 1967 season, the Athletics had five starters with an average age of 21.8. Their seventh-place finish in 1966 was Kansas City&#x27;s finest since Finley had purchased the team, and the grateful owner rewarded Dark with a Cadillac after the season. Their record was not quite as good in 1967, as Dark piloted them to a 52–69 record in their first 131 games. His second season with the Athletics ended in August, due to a disagreement over player discipline after Finley fined and suspended pitcher Lew Krausse Jr. for his behavior on a team flight. Dark believed, after talking to several of the other players, that Krausse had been playing little pranks on Athletics broadcaster Monte Moore, who then falsely reported to Finley that Krausse used &quot;deplorable language&quot; when talking to a pregnant woman on the flight. Because Dark refused to carry out the suspension, Finley asked to see him at his hotel room in Washington, D.C., where the Athletics had gone for a road trip against the Washington Senators. In a seven-hour meeting, Finley fired his manager, decided to rehire him, then fired him again when he was presented with a player&#x27;s statement backing Dark and criticizing Finley&#x27;s use of spies to keep tabs on the players. Additionally, Finley released first baseman Ken Harrelson, who had also stood up for Krausse. Harrelson dubbed Finley &quot;a menace to the sport.&quot; Despite the dismissal, Dark remained in correspondence with Finley, who would often make long-distance phone calls to his ex-manager.

Dark was hired to manage the Cleveland Indians in 1968 by Vernon Stouffer; the Indians had an 86–75 record in his first year, their best performance since 1959. Sam McDowell theorized that the team would have had an even better year if they had gotten more hits with runners in scoring position. After an initial third-place season, Dark requested and was given the additional duties of general manager, but having the field manager negotiate the players&#x27; contracts proved an untenable situation. Dark eventually concluded that the same person should not hold both roles, because the general manager&#x27;s job is to make the player think he is worth less money, while the manager&#x27;s job is to make him think he is more valuable to the team. Over the next two seasons, the team slumped to a 62–99 record in 1969 and a 76–86 finish in 1970. With the team in last place in the AL East in mid-1971 and attendance down by 60,000, Dark was fired on July 29. Because he had signed a five-year contract with the team in 1969, Cleveland had to continue to pay him through the 1973 season.

In the meantime, the Athletics had moved to Oakland, and after manager Dick Williams resigned following consecutive World Series triumphs in 1972–73, Finley rehired Dark. A newscaster reporting on the move quipped, &quot;The only thing worse than being hired by Charlie Finley is being hired by him a second time.&quot; Now taking his religion more seriously, Dark promised not to complain about players in public or demean them. Dark&#x27;s hiring was met with resentment by some of the Athletics coaches, such as Irv Noren, the third base coach, who had hoped to be hired as manager himself. Noren and Vern Hoscheit, the bullpen coach, were replaced in July. Dark also had trouble earning the respect of Athletics pitchers such as Vida Blue and Ken Holtzman. Frequently, when he went out to the mound to replace the starter, the pitchers would disrespectfully flip the baseball to him instead of handing it over. In July, Dark had finally had enough. &quot;I made up my mind to have a squad meeting [on July 14] at the park,&quot; he said. In the speech, he criticized the team for their attitudes, fining Blue $250. Blue paid the fine in change: &quot;I had a big old money bag that probably weighed about 75 pounds.&quot; The speech helped the players to be more responsive to Dark, and though they would get no-hit days later by Dick Bosman of the Indians, they went on to win the AL West. In the AL Championship Series (ALCS), the Athletics defeated the Orioles three games to one, holding Baltimore scoreless for 30 straight innings during the series. The series victory sent Oakland to the World Series and made Dark the third manager (after Joe McCarthy and Yogi Berra) at the time to win pennants in both leagues. (Sparky Anderson, Dick Williams, Tony La Russa, Jim Leyland, and Joe Maddon have since accomplished that feat.) In the World Series, the Athletics faced the Dodgers in the first World Series composed of only California teams. Oakland won the series in five games, becoming the first team to win three consecutive World Series since the Yankees won five straight from 1949 to 1953.

Entering the 1975 season, the Athletics had to cope with the loss of pitcher Catfish Hunter, winner of 20 or more games four straight seasons, who had used a contract breach to become a free agent and sign with the Yankees. Still, the team posted a 55–32 record in the first half of the season, and seven Athletics were part of the AL All-Star Team, managed by Dark. The team won the AL West by seven games over the runner-up Kansas City Royals; however, they were swept in the ALCS by the Boston Red Sox. Though they made the playoffs both years under Dark, he was not re-hired as the Athletics manager in 1976. During a church talk that September, Dark had said, &quot;To God, Charlie Finley is just a very little, bitty thing. If he doesn&#x27;t accept Jesus Christ as his personal savior, he&#x27;s going to hell.&quot; When Finley announced Dark would not return for 1976, he stated that the manager was &quot;too busy with church activities.&quot;

Dark spent 1976 out of baseball for the first time in 30 years. He was hired as a coach for the Cubs in 1977, working under Herman Franks, who had coached under and later replaced Dark as the manager of the Giants. While Dark had been disappointed at the replacement, the men had remained friends and were happy to work together again. His tenure with the Cubs was short-lived, as on May 28, he was hired to replace John McNamara as manager of the San Diego Padres. The Padres, who had a 21–28 record when he took over, had a 48–65 record for the rest of the season. Dark&#x27;s contract called for him to manage for two years, but general manager Buzzie Bavasi was replaced with Bob Fontaine Sr. in 1978, and Fontaine preferred someone other than Dark to manage the ballclub. In the midst of spring training, on March 21, Dark was fired, replaced by Roger Craig. It was only the second time that a major league manager had been fired during spring training. Because his contract ran through 1979, the Padres still had to pay him for two years, much like the Indians had been obligated to do from 1971 to 1973. Dark ended his managerial career with a 994–954 record, good for a .510 winning percentage.

During games he managed, Dark would stand in the front of his team&#x27;s dugout with one foot up on the steps, drawing comparisons to Washington crossing the Delaware. He went beyond traditional statistics in evaluating players, using a point system to determine who his best were. Hits in key situations or hits that advanced a runner garnered points for players, but miscues such as overrunning a base or ignoring a sign would lead to a deduction. &quot;There are winning .275 hitters and losing .310 hitters,&quot; Dark said of his system. Cepeda had a rather low score, which annoyed the player once he found out about it. Later in his managerial career, Dark stopped using the system, not wanting to cause resentment.

Though Dark never managed again after 1978 spring training, he did hold two other baseball positions. In 1981, the Cubs hired him to be their farm system evaluator. Later, in 1986, the Chicago White Sox hired him to be their minor league director. He was thrilled that the White Sox were hiring former major league players to coach minor league teams, something not often seen at the time.

==Legacy==
&quot;Dark was a great hit-and-run guy, and very tough to strike out,&quot; Phil Rizzuto, shortstop for the Yankees in the early 1950s, recalled. &quot;And he was a fiery ballplayer. He got into more fights than either Pee Wee or me.&quot; Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that, of the &quot;three superb shortstops&quot; in New York following the war, Dark had the best batting average and the most home runs, even though he is the only one not in the Hall of Fame. Joe DiMaggio said he was a &quot;Red Rolfe type of hitter,&quot; noting that Dark could &quot;bunt or drag, hit behind the runner, or push the ball to the opposite field,&quot; which made him useful in the number two position in the batting lineup. In a 1969 poll, Giants fans selected Dark as the greatest shortstop in team history. According to baseball writer Bill James, Dark may have lost a Hall of Fame career due to his debut being delayed by his military service.

In 1976, Dark was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. Five years later, he was elected to the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame. Alvin Dark Avenue, located just south of LSU&#x27;s campus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is named after him.

Dark made an uncredited appearance in &quot;The Kid from Cleveland&quot; in 1949, as one of the Boston Braves shown in the film. Fifty-two years later, his 1961 &quot;Topps&quot; baseball card was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Skipped Parts&quot;, being thrown into a fire as part of a rite of passage/growing up event between a stern grandfather (R. Lee Ermey) and his grandson (Bug Hall).

==Personal life==
Dark was married twice. His first wife, Adrienne Managan, was his childhood sweetheart; the two had grown up going to the same church. They had four children: Allison, Gene, Eve, and Margaret. In 1962, he met Jacolyn &quot;Jackie&quot; Troy while she was serving as an airline stewardess on a flight he was on. Although it went against his Christian beliefs, he began having an affair with her. They tried multiple times to break it off, and Dark even told his wife about it in December 1962. This led to the Darks moving back to Lake Charles after the 1963 season, so Adrienne could be nearer her family in case the couple got divorced, though Robert Boyle of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; thought the move meant that Dark was trying to become manager of the Houston Astros. Finally, in November 1968, Adrienne filed for legal separation from Dark, as couples in Louisiana had to be legally separated for 14 months before they could get a divorce. The divorce was finalized early in the 1970 baseball season, and Alvin married Jackie the same day he signed the last divorce papers. Though he believed divorce was sinful, &quot;we just weren&#x27;t letting God get in our way,&quot; he said of his decision to remarry. &quot;There are people in Lake Charles who have not spoken to me since, much less forgiven me,&quot; Dark wrote in 1980. After some initial struggles, Alvin and Jackie developed a happy marriage by 1974 and stayed together for 44 years until Alvin&#x27;s death in 2014. Jackie had two children from a previous marriage, Rusty and Lori, whom Dark adopted in October 1970.

Dark&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Blackie.&quot;

A Baptist, Dark had a reputation as a devout Christian. He said his parents took him to church &quot;ever since I was old enough to breathe.&quot; During the 1960s, when he had the affair and his marriage fell apart, Dark wrote that &quot;I had found it easier not to go to church. Easier not to take my Bible on road trips. Easier to jump on a player, or to cuss an umpire.&quot; After his time with the Indians, he began to take his faith more seriously when he started attending a Bible study with his wife. He would often quote scripture during press conferences. Dark also used to present his Christian testimony at churches, though he quit doing so from 1963 through the early 1970s because of his divorce. Finley once instructed Dark to &quot;lay off the Bible,&quot; but the unpredictable Finley also once asked Dark to talk about his faith at a Chicago restaurant. Dark was a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

Dark was good friends with Stanky, his roommate when the two played together on the Braves and Giants. As players, both dreamed of managing major league teams one day, and Dark spoke highly of Stanky&#x27;s baseball intelligence. &quot;Stanky knew so much more about the game than anybody else. If there were ten possible percentage plays to make, most guys would know four or five. Stanky would know ten.&quot; After their careers, the two did not correspond as much; Dark speculated this was because of the divorce, as Stanky was a devout Catholic.

Dark&#x27;s career in the major leagues as a player and manager spanned over 30 seasons. &quot;Baseball is his life,&quot; said Lee Walls, who was Dark&#x27;s roommate with the Cubs. &quot;He lives, breathes and talks baseball most of the time.&quot; During offseasons, Dark would supplement his income by working for the Magabar Mud Company, which provided oil drillers with mud. Dark enjoyed golf, and Maule called him the best baseball-playing golfer &quot;with the possible exception of...Paul Richards.&quot; He played in the Bing Crosby National Pro-Amateur in Pebble Beach, California, 12 times; and he also played in Jackie Gleason&#x27;s Inverrary Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. After his dismissal from the Indians, he briefly played for money, charging as much as $100 for someone to play against him. In 1980, Dark penned an autobiography (with John Underwood) entitled &quot;When in Doubt, Fire the Manager&quot;, published by E. P. Dutton.

In 1983, Dark and Jackie moved to Easley, South Carolina, where they would live for the rest of their lives. He started the Alvin Dark Foundation, which gives money to Christian ministries. On November 13, 2014, Dark died at his home in Easley, from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, at the age of 92. He was survived by his second wife, his children, 20 grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.

<text>Donat Roy Mittoo (3 March 1948 – 16 December 1990), better known as Jackie Mittoo, was a Jamaican-Canadian keyboardist, songwriter and musical director. He was a member of The Skatalites and musical director of the Studio One record label.

Upon hearing of Mittoo&#x27;s death, Coxsone Dodd commented &quot;He was an ambassador of our music worldwide... there can be no doubt. Read the legacy this young man has left behind. May his name be remembered and his music live on.&quot;

==Biography==
Mittoo, of partial Indo-Jamaican descent, was born in Brown&#x27;s Town, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, and began learning to play the piano when he was three under the tutelage of his grandmother.

In the 1960s, he was a member of The Skatalites, The Sheiks, The Soul Brothers, The Soul Vendors and Sound Dimension. Mittoo&#x27;s compositions in this period included &quot;Darker Shade of Black&quot;, &quot;Feel Like Jumping&quot;, and &quot;Baby Why&quot;. He played with Lloyd &quot;Matador&quot; Daley in 1968 and 1969.

In the mid-1970s, he emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There he recorded three albums, &quot;Wishbone&quot; (Summus), &quot;Reggae Magic&quot; (CTL) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Put It All Together&quot; (CTL). He also set up the Stine-Jac record label, as well as running a record store.

In 1970, his song &quot;Peanie Wallie&quot; was reworked into a song called &quot;Duppy Conqueror&quot; and recorded by The Wailers. Mittoo&#x27;s song &quot;Wishbone&quot; was a hit in 1971. He performed in local Toronto lounges throughout the 1970s. Mittoo assisted Toronto-area reggae musicians, including Earth, Roots and Water, Esso Jaxxon (R. Zee Jackson), Carl Harvey, Lord Tanamo, Boyo Hammond, Carl Otway, The Sattalites, Jackie James and Jason Wilson. Mittoo continued to record for Jamaican producers in the 1970s, mostly Bunny Lee. He co-wrote &quot;Armagideon Time&quot; (later recorded by The Clash) with Willi Williams, released in 1980.

In the 1980s, he often worked with Sugar Minott. In 1985, he travelled to Ghana with British band Musical Youth, and while there recorded tracks that would later be released on the album &quot;Jackie Mittoo in Africa&quot;. In 1989, he briefly rejoined The Skatalites, but left when his health started to deteriorate. In 1989 and 1990, he recorded &quot;Wild Jockey&quot; for Lloyd Barnes&#x27; Wackies label.

Mittoo entered a hospital on 12 December 1990 and died of cancer on 16 December at the age of 42. His funeral was held at the National Arena in Kingston, Jamaica, on 2 January 1991. Hortense Ellis, Neville &#x27;Tinga&#x27; Stewart, Desmond &quot;Desi Roots&quot; Young, Ruddy Thomas, Tommy Cowan and Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd were among the attendees. A memorial concert was held around the same time, with performances by Vin Gordon, Leroy &quot;Horsemouth&quot; Wallace, Glen &#x27;Bagga&#x27; Fagan, Pablo Black, Robbie Lyn, Michael &quot;Ibo&quot; Cooper, Ken Boothe, Delroy Wilson, Carlene Davis, Tinga Stewart and others.

His 1966 song, &quot;Free Soul&quot; with The Soul Brothers was interplayed in the 2006 Lily Allen song, &quot;Smile&quot;.

In 2013, Mittoo was referenced by Superchunk in their song &quot;Me &amp; You &amp; Jackie Mittoo&quot; from their album &quot;I Hate Music&quot;.

His pioneering role and importance to reggae music in Canada, along with recordings of his performances on CBC-TV, was featured on the 2018 documentary series &quot;From the Vaults&quot; on CBC.

In 2024, Mittoo&#x27;s album &quot;Macka Fat&quot; was named the jury winner of the Slaight Family Polaris Heritage Prize at the 2024 Polaris Music Prize.

<doc id="1166913" wikidata="Q2602737" url="?curid=1166913" title="Alfred Coppel">
<text>Alfred Coppel, Alfredo Jose de Arana-Marini Coppel (November 9, 1921 – May 30, 2004) was an American author. Born in Oakland, he served as a fighter pilot in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After his discharge, he started his career as a writer. He became one of the most prolific pulp magazine authors of the 1950s and 1960s, adopting the pseudonyms Robert Cham Gilman and A.C. Marin and writing for a variety of pulp magazines and later &quot;slick&quot; publishers. Though writing in a variety of genres, including action thrillers, he is known for his science fiction stories which comprise both short stories and novels.

==Science fiction==
Coppel&#x27;s first science fiction story was &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; (1947) in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Other short stories include &quot;The Dreamer&quot; (1952) about a man called Denby, who wants to be the first to orbit the Moon, published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; and reprinted in the anthology &quot;Best Short Shorts&quot; (1958) edited by Eric Berger. His post-holocaust novel &quot;Dark December&quot; (1960) describes the aftermath of nuclear war.

As Robert Cham Gilman, he wrote the &quot;Rhada&quot; sequence of science fiction novels aimed at the young adult market. These space operas, set within a galactic empire, comprise &quot;The Rebel of Rhada&quot; (1968), &quot;The Navigator of Rhada&quot; (1969), &quot;The Starkahn of Rhada&quot; (1970) and a prequel called &quot;The Warlock of Rhada&quot; (1985). &quot;The Rebel of Rhada&quot; is an expansion, with many changes including a significantly different ending, of &quot;The Rebel of Valkyr,&quot; published in 1950 under his own name and included in Brian Aldiss&#x27;s collection &quot;Galactic Empires&quot;.

&quot;The Burning Mountain: A Novel of the Invasion of Japan&quot; (1983) is an alternate history depicting what could have happened if the United States and its allies had been forced to invade Japan in 1946, had the Trinity test of the Fat Man nuclear design on July 16, 1945, failed. This is based on the Operation Coronet and Operation Olympic, United States battle plans for the invasion of Japan, which were rendered moot by Japan&#x27;s surrender after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

==Other books==
In 1967, he wrote &quot;The Gate of Hell&quot;, a love story about an American serving with the Israeli Paratroopers Brigade during the 1956 Suez Campaign; it was published by Pinnacle Books in 1972. In 1974, he had a bestseller with the suspense thriller &quot;Thirty-Four East&quot; about the Arab–Israeli conflict. Another political thriller was &quot;The Apocalypse Brigade&quot;, 1981, about the United States at war with global terrorism. And based on his own experiences as World War II fighter pilot, &quot;Order of Battle&quot;, a gritty account of a P-38 Lightning pilot.
