<text>Lafleche is a small town in southwest Saskatchewan, Canada in the Rural Municipality of Wood River No. 74. The community is located at the intersection of Highway 13 and Highway 58. It is 20 km south of Gravelbourg and 45 km west of Assiniboia. It is situated on the south bank of Lafleche Creek, which is a tributary of Wood River. Thomson Lake Regional Park is located 10 minutes north of town.

==History==
The village of Buffalo Head started to form one and a half miles east of the present townsite with the arrival of settlers in 1905. The name was changed to Lafleche in honour of Louis-François Richer Laflèche.

In 1910, a school district was formed and a school was built at the corner of four townships on a quarter of land owned by Mr. Belisle.

In March 1912, there was already a hamlet set on a piece of land owned by F. X. Brunelle. There was a bank, two stores and blacksmith shops.

In 1912, the railway was built to Expanse, then in the fall as far as Assiniboia. When the Canadian Pacific Railway line came through in 1913 lots were divided and businesses were quickly established. Since the rail line did not pass through the hamlet, the houses of the hamlet were moved to the new site on the southeast quarter of Section 2, Township 9, Range 5, and soon another village with spacious streets and avenues sprung up and developed rapidly.

By 1913 there was the following businesses, Square Deal Store, Harness, Palace Livery, Beaver Lumber, Coal, Lafleche Cafe, Murphy&#x27;s Pool Hall, Metropole Hotel, The Western Trading Co., Lafleche Meat Market, City Dray, City Garage, City Restaurant and Bakery, Glenholm Farm, Chopping, The Lafleche Blacksmith. Growth was so rapid that Lafleche was incorporated as a village in 1913. Telegraph service was established in Lafleche on December 1, 1913. By 1914 the village was composed of twelve blocks.

In 1915, many new businesses opened up, Cockshutt Plow Company, a jewelry store, Wyman and Ball (clothing store), a drug store, three lumber yards, the Lafleche-Meleval Farmers Elevators, Purity Oil, Kennedy Grain, a livery and feed barn, Real Estate and Loan Office. In 1916 a millinery was opened up which made fur hats to order. Two other private millinery stores were opened, one which became a regular was called Ladies Ready-to-Wear.

In 1919 water had to be hauled to town from the Rosy farm, and professional nursing services were available by Nurse Noble. In 1921 all school children were inoculated for typhoid fever.

In 1922, it was the year of the Big Bank Robbery. On May 24, thieves broke into the Bank of Hocheloga, blowing the safe but were unsuccessful in opening it. Constable Pete Whitelaw was shot in the thigh while trying to apprehend the culprits. As a result, he spent two months in a Moose Jaw hospital. In September robbers once again visited the village. Telephone wires were cut and shots were fired at Mrs. Vick (telephone operator), Chas. Chan and Alex Stewart. No money was taken and the robbers fled by car.

In 1927, trees were planted on both sides of Main Street. A fire brigade was organized, with Nap Deuast as fire chief. Cement sidewalks were built in September of that year. Rest Rooms were opened for women also at this time.

In 1927 or 1928 a Men&#x27;s Ready-to-Wear store was opened by Lawrence Lazure, next to the Globe Theatre. His office was shared by Mr. A Tissot, who was Lafleche&#x27;s first photographer. The Globe Theatre began to show &quot;sound&quot; movies. This theatre was operational till about 1942 by Mr. Passmore but he sold it to Mr. E. Flynn. The theatre building is presently the Club 50. Before 1927, the people would watch silent movies in the basement of what is now the Legion Hall.

In August 1928, the Shaunavon Electric Company furnished electric lights and current to the village of Lafleche. By November 1929, street lights outlined Main Street.

The thirties saw hard times in the community of Lafleche. People worked for twenty cents an hour and team and man for sixty cents an hour. Rent was three to five dollars a month. Despite the drought, Lafleche was to become a village of cleanliness and beauty. Boulevards were laid out on street adjacent to Main Street and trees were planted.

In 1937 after eight consecutive crop failures, the once prosperous Lafleche district was near rock bottom. In dire need of credit, farmers and small businessmen found the bank and other financial institutions had no confidence in their ability to repay. Within a year the people of Lafleche launched the first rural community credit union in the province. Lafleche Credit Union received its charter on April 19, 1938.

Lafleche survived the thirties and the early war years of the forties. In 1943, Dr. Belcourt was appointed the first Municipal doctor, and Lafleche took over the operation of a hospital in 1944, establishing a hospital district in 1945.

In 1947 Saskatchewan Power signed an agreement with Lafleche to supply electrical energy.

Many of the buildings were built of lumber and with unsafe heating furnaces, many fires were reported. Lafleche did not have very good fire preventive measures, with only two teams of horses and two water tanks. Many of the first buildings were destroyed by fires and most of the livery and feed barns were burned. In 1948 a fire destroyed a third of the buildings on the east side of Main Street which led to the purchase of a fire truck and equipment and a siren alarm.
The Village of Lafleche became a town in 1953 with C.P. Dewulf as the first mayor.

In 1954 vapour lights were installed by Saskatchewan Power Corporation and in 1956 the town received water and sewer service. The sewer main construction began in 1957 and in June, 1958 the Town Water and Sewer Plant was officially opened.

In 1960 a piece of land was bought for the purpose of a landing strip for light airplanes. In 1961 Saskatchewan Government Telephone constructed a new dial office and telephone. Water meters were installed in residences and business places. Automatic telephones came in operation on July 5, 1962.

In November, 1961 a curling rink with three sheets of ice came into operation.

As a tribute to Saskatchewan&#x27;s 60th anniversary the town of Lafleche built self-contained housing units for senior citizens. The Wood River Centennial Home was opened on July 8, 1967.

In 1969 the streets were paved in Lafleche. 1971 was the Homecoming Celebration. 1973 saw the opening of a new skating rink. On October 24, 1977 the Wheatland Lodge was opened as an eighteen suite, senior citizen low rental housing building.
Lafleche celebrated its Centennial in 2013.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lafleche had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Religion==
The First Presbyterian Church was the first church in the community with F. W. Therrien (a lay minister) conducting the first services in 1913.

Construction of the Roman Catholic church was also begun in 1913 with Father Emile Dubois arriving in 1914. He actively helped pioneers establish themselves in the vicinity and within five years the population increased from 300 to 600. In 1915 the Sisters of the Holy Cross arrived and in the winter of 1916 and 1917 a convent with a school for boys and girls was completed. Enrolment included 40 students boarders and local day students. Five years later student enrolment had climbed to 140. In 1922 a new larger brick faced church with a gothic steeple was built. St. Radegonde Roman Catholic Church is now a listed heritage property. The old church became the Legion Hall.

==Mail service==
From 1909 until the railway came, mail was delivered to Lafleche by horse and buggy or sleigh from different points on the main line. However, once the railway was built, mail came regularly. Mail was sorted on the train as it went along. Mail was taken aboard and dropped off at each stop all across Canada. Tom Murphy was the first postman in Lafleche, and held the position until July 26, 1912. Mr. Edmond Bilodeau became postmaster in 1927, a held the position for 27 years. He retired on April 25, 1955. On July 31, 1958, the train service was discontinued, and mail trucks took over the business of mail service to Lafleche and surrounding towns.

==Grain==
Following the arrival of the railway in 1913, construction of grain elevators came about. The first elevator was built in 1912. The capacity of elevators built at this time was 25,000 to 35,000 bushel capacity. Some of the first grain elevator businesses in Lafleche were: Shepard Grain Company, Saskatchewan Co-op Elevator Company which were both built in 1914. In 1915 the Shepard Company sold to Alberta Pacific Grain Company. In 1916 the Lafleche Meleval&#x27;s Farmer&#x27;s Elevator Company, McCabe Brothers Elevator Company and the Imperial Elevator Company were built. Some of these elevators did not last around too long and others changed hands many times.

The Lafleche Flour Mill was built in 1914 by Paul Bourdy. The mill was operated for a few years, then operations were suspended until 1920. In 1921, Fred Anderson rented the mill. He was soon joined by E. Olsen. Mr. Olsen became the manager and hired Herb Husband to run the mill at night and later hired Jim Clark. During the winter the mill ran day and night for five months. The flour went to retailers and bakers around Lafleche. In the late 1930s mill work became limited and by 1940, only custom grinding was done. Operations stopped in 1941, when the owners moved away. In 1952 the building was bought and converted into a seed cleaning plan. This operation kept going until 1974, when the owner died and operations ceased. It was sold in a public auction, dismantled and removed from the site.

==Financial services==
The Bank of Hochelaga was established in 1920 until 1924. Though not in operation for very long, it gave the townspeople excitement, when an attempted robbery occurred on May 24, 1922. On March 13, 1924 it was reported that the Lafleche Branch of the Bank of Hochelaga would be closed and accounts would be transferred to the Bank of Hochelaga in Gravelbourg. The closing of the Lafleche branch corresponded with changes that were occurring in Montreal at the time.

The Bank of Toronto began doing business in 1913. In 1955 the name was changed to Toronto-Dominion when the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank amalgamated.

In 1937, after eight consecutive crop failures, Lafleche&#x27;s district was hitting a financial low. Banks did not have faith in farmers and small businesses to repay loans, so a few local residents explored the idea of a credit union. On April 19, 1938, charter No. 12 was granted to the Lafleche Credit Union Limited which then became the first rural community credit union in the province. Starting with assets valued at $52.50 and twelve members, the company grew to have $10, 994 assets and about two hundred members after the first year. In 1948, there was 1087 members and assets reaches $518,000. This helped put the Lafleche district back in prosperity. The Lafleche Credit Union Limited is also known for having granted the first credit union loan for the purchase of farm land. In 1954, the Fir Mountain Savings and Credit Union amalgamated with the Lafleche Credit Union and in 1971 Glentworth Credit Union amalgamated too. A branch office is maintained in Glentworth.

Al Charbonneau, an early employee of the credit union, went on to a distinguished career, first as manager of the Saskatchewan Credit Union League in 1959, and later as CEO of the World Council of Credit Unions from 1981-1993. One credit union historian states that &quot;[p]artly because he came from a francophone background in Canada, Charbonneau had a deep understanding of the cultural dimensions of credit unionism. ... He would provide considerable leadership in expanding the linguistic capabilities of the World Council and in expanding contacts with European movements.&quot;

==Utilities==
In 1922, a power plant was operated by Zotique Raiche to operate lights in the Village of Lafleche. It was called the Lafleche Light Company and was powered by a 50 H.P. engine. It operated from dark until eleven o&#x27;clock, Monday and Tuesday mornings and also by special arrangements for dances. The first street lights were installed in 1923. In 1933, only two street lights were left in operation due to the depression. In September, 1936, a request for more street lights was requested by Lafleche. The total cost of running eight lights was $15.00 per month. In 1947, it was bought out by Saskatchewan Power Commission. In 1949 the voltage of the town was increased from 2,300 volts to 4,600 volts.

==Medical services==
Before Lafleche had a doctor, their needs were met by Dr. Gravel from Gravelbourg. Lafleche had its first medical doctor in March, 1913. Dr. DuChene did not last long because of an unfortunate accident. Gangrene set in and he died on December 9, 1913. Other doctors came and went between the years 1914 – 1916. In September, 1916, Dr. Louis-Emile Belcourt took over the position and held it for thirty-two years. He was truly a pioneer doctor, for her travelled many miles in a wide area surrounding Lafleche to meet people&#x27;s needs. He purchased a snow-plane during the thirties with speeds up to fifty miles an hour to reach more people in less time. Dr. Belcourt opened the first hospital in 1941. Dr. Belcourt assisted in over 3,000 births and assisted at and performed over 1,500 operations. In 1948, Dr. Belcourt left to practice medicine in Moose Jaw. Dr. The RM of Wood River took over the hospital in 1945 and in 1957 a new hospital was built.

In 1913, a drugstore was opened. Adrien Belcourt took over the drugstore in 1919. He sold the original building in 1942, and moved it into the Liquor Board Store, which has housed the Lafleche Pharmacy since. Adrien Belcourt ran the drugstore for forty-five years, from 1919–1964, when he retired. The store has since then been managed by his son, Edmond.

Lafleche had one of the first dentists to practice in southern Saskatchewan. Dr. W.G. Wallace, first started in 1913, working two days a week in Lafleche and two days a week in Gravelbourg. In 1916, he worked solely out of Lafleche. Dr. Kestrel replaced Dr. Wallace in May, 1929.

From 1918-1942, Mrs. Cameroon operated a private nursing home. Mrs. Margaret Douglas provided nursing services from 1916-1926. Mrs. Noble came to Lafleche from England and was a trained nurse. Mrs. Deluge also operated a nursing home. Mrs. Bola Boyd was a midwife and nurse in Lafleche for twenty-four years. Mrs. Boyd ran a licensed nursing home for close to fifteen years. She was the matron at the hospital for over nine years. Mrs. William Klein the matron at the hospital before Mrs. Boyd and was sometimes called upon to help assist in operations.

<text>Keiji Haino ( &quot;Haino Keiji&quot;; born May 3, 1952) is a Japanese musician and singer-songwriter whose work has included rock, free improvisation, noise music, percussion, psychedelic music, minimalism and drone music. He has been active since the 1970s and continues to record regularly and in new styles.

==History==
Haino&#x27;s initial artistic outlet was theatre, inspired by the radical writings of Antonin Artaud. An epiphanic moment came when he heard The Doors&#x27; &quot;When The Music&#x27;s Over&quot; and changed course towards music. After brief stints in a number of blues and experimental outfits, he formed improvisational rock band Lost Aaraaf in 1970. In the mid 1970s, having left Lost Aaraaf, he collaborated with psychedelic multi-instrumentalist Magical Power Mako.

His musical output throughout the late 1970s is scarcely documented, that is until the formation of his rock duo Fushitsusha in 1978 (although their first LP did not surface until 1989). This outfit initially consisted of Haino on guitar and vocals, and Tamio Shiraishi on synthesizer. With the departure of Shiraishi and the addition of Jun Hamano (bass) and Shuhei Takashima (drums), Fushitsusha operated as a trio. The lineup soon changed, with Yasushi Ozawa (bass) and Jun Kosugi (drums) performing throughout the 1990s, but returned to a duo with Haino supplementing percussion with tape-loops.

Haino formed Aihiyo in 1998, principally playing a diverse range of covers (including The Rolling Stones, The Ronettes, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience), transforming the original material into Haino&#x27;s unique form of garage psychedelia.

NHK, Japan&#x27;s national broadcaster, banned him from broadcast from 1973 to 2013.

Other groups Haino has formed include Vajra (with underground folk singer Kan Mikami and drummer Toshiaki Ishizuka), Knead (with the avant-prog outfit Ruins), Sanhedolin (with Yoshida Tatsuya of Ruins and Mitsuru Nasuno of Korekyojinn, Altered States and Ground Zero) and a solo project called Nijiumu. He has also collaborated with many artists, including Faust, Boris, Derek Bailey, Joey Baron, Peter Brötzmann, Lee Konitz, Loren Mazzacane Connors, Charles Gayle, Earl Kuck, Bill Laswell, Musica Transonic, Stephen O&#x27;Malley, Makigami Koichi, Ayuo, Merzbow, Oren Ambarchi, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, John Zorn, Yamantaka Eye, John Duncan, Fred Frith, Charles Hayward and John Butcher.

In 2025, a Haino concert scheduled to take place at Metz&#x27;s Saint-Étienne Cathedral was moved to the Centre Pompidou-Metz following a mobilization of traditionalist Catholic movements, including banned far-right organization Civitas.

==Style==
His main instruments of choice have been guitar and vocals, with many other instruments and approaches incorporated into his career&#x27;s work. Haino is known for intensely cathartic sound explorations, and despite the fact that much of his work contains varied instrumentation and accompaniment, he retains a distinctive style.

Haino cites a broad range of influences, including troubadour music, Marlene Dietrich, Iannis Xenakis, Blue Cheer, Syd Barrett, and Charlie Parker. At a young age, he had an epiphany through his introduction to The Doors. His recent foray into DJing at Tokyo nightclubs has reportedly reflected his eclectic taste. He has had a long love affair with early blues music, particularly the works of Blind Lemon Jefferson, and is heavily inspired by the Japanese musical concept of &quot;Ma&quot;, the silent spaces in music (see Taiko for more information). In a 2012 interview with &quot;Time Out Tokyo&quot;, he described his approach as &quot;defying the notion that you can&#x27;t create something from nothing.&quot; He also has a keen interest in Butoh dancing and collecting ethnic instruments.

Haino&#x27;s uniqueness extends to his lifestyle: he has sported the same long hair, black clothes and sunglasses throughout his career, and is a strict straight edge vegetarian who has refrained from alcohol, tobacco and recreational drugs for his entire life.

<text>The FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup is an international association football tournament, organized by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), for national teams of women under the age of 20. The tournament is held biennially. It was first held in 2002 as the FIFA U-19 Women&#x27;s World Championship with an upper age limit of 19. In 2006, the age limit was raised to the current 20. The event was renamed as a World Cup since the 2008 competition, making its name consistent with FIFA&#x27;s other worldwide competitions for national teams.

Starting with the 2010 edition, tournaments held in years immediately preceding the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup are awarded as part of the bidding process for the Women&#x27;s World Cup. In those years, the U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup serves as a test event for the host nation of the Women&#x27;s World Cup, a role similar to that of the former FIFA Confederations Cup in the men&#x27;s game.

The current champions are North Korea, who won their third title at the 2024 tournament in Colombia.

== Qualification ==
Each continental governing body has its own qualifying tournament, but Africa does not determine a champion.
==History==

===2002===
The first women&#x27;s world championship at the youth level, held as the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women&#x27;s World Championship, with an age limit of 19, was hosted by Canada. The final, held at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, drew a surprisingly large crowd of 47,000 to watch the hosts play the United States. The US defeated Canada 1–0 on a golden goal by Lindsay Tarpley. Canada&#x27;s Christine Sinclair was the adidas Golden Ball recipient, as tournament MVP, and the Golden Shoe (10 goals) winner.

===2004===
The 2004 FIFA U-19 Women&#x27;s World Championship was held in Thailand. For the second time in a row, the current holders of the senior World Cup, Germany, won the youth competition. The Golden Ball went to Brazilian star, Marta, while for the second time the Golden Boot went to a Canadian, Brittany Timko.

===2006===
FIFA raised the women&#x27;s youth championship age limit to 20 to match the men&#x27;s, beginning with the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Championship, held in Russia from 17 August through 3 September.

The competition was held in four Moscow stadiums (Dinamo, Lokomotiv, Podmoskovie Stadium and Torpedo Stadion) and one in St. Petersburg (Petrovskiy Stadion).

Korea DPR won the final 5–0 over China PR.

===2008===
The 2008 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Championship was held in Chile, from 20 November to 7 December 2008.

Six years after winning their first championship at the youth level in 2002, the United States reclaimed the trophy with a 2–1 win over defending champions Korea DPR. The Golden Ball and the Golden Shoe went to Sydney Leroux of the United States.

===2010===
The 2010 edition of the tournament was held in Germany from 13 July to 1 August 2010. The host nation defeated Nigeria in the final to claim its second championship. It was the first time that an African nation had advanced as far as the semifinals. It was also the first tournament in which four different confederations were represented in the semifinals. The Golden Ball and Golden Shoe awards both went to Alexandra Popp of Germany.

===2012===

The 2012 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup was played in Japan from 19 August to 8 September, after initially having a hosting bid from Vietnam withdrawn and a bid from Uzbekistan rejected. The Golden Ball went to Dzsenifer Marozsán of Germany, while the Golden Shoe went to Kim Un-hwa of North Korea.

===2014===
The 2014 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup was held in Canada from 5–25 August 2014, who reprised its role as host after a Zimbabwean bid withdrew leaving the Canadian bid unopposed. The Golden Ball and Golden Shoe awards both went to Asisat Oshoala of Nigeria.

===2016===

The 2016 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup was expected to be held in South Africa, but due to the country&#x27;s withdrawal, a new host was chosen on 19 March 2015, and it was Papua New Guinea.

===2018===
The 2018 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup was held in France from 5–24 August 2018; a year later France would host the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The Golden Ball and Golden Shoe awards both went to Patricia Guijarro of Spain.

===2020===
The 2020 edition was initially to be hosted jointly by Costa Rica and Panama in August 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic it has been postponed to January 2021, to be solely hosted by Costa Rica. Due to having the highest COVID-19 cases and deaths in the region, Panama withdrew from hosting this event along with the 2022 Central American and Caribbean Games. The tournament was initially postponed to 2021, subject to further monitoring. On 17 November 2020, FIFA announced that the 2020 edition of the tournament would be cancelled.

===2022===
Following the cancellation of the 2020 edition, Costa Rica were appointed as hosts of the tournament in 2022. 
===2024===
As of 2024 the tournament will be expanded from 16 to 24 teams. Colombia was selected as host on 23 June 2023.

===2026===

Poland was selected as host on 17 December 2023.

<text>The Obregón is a Mexican designed semi-automatic pistol designed in the mid-1930s by the mechanical engineer Alejandro Obregón. It uses the same .45 caliber ammunition as the Colt 1911 and it resembles the 1911 in overall appearance, frame size and weight. However it features a rotating barrel locking system. This system employs a diagonal cam on the rear of the barrel sliding against a diagonal receiver-mounted groove that rotates the barrel. This is like the Austro-Hungarian Steyr M1912 pistol, unlike the &quot;swinging link and pin&quot; of the Colt M1911 series.

One of the Obregón&#x27;s design simplifications is that the safety switch and the slide lock are a single unit. Fewer than 1,000 of these pistols were produced at the national armory in Mexico City between 1934 and 1938. It was not a sales success, nor was it commissioned by the Mexican government.

<doc id="1174141" wikidata="Q32439" url="?curid=1174141" title="Stéphane Audran">
<text>Stéphane Audran (born Colette Suzanne Jeannine Dacheville; 8 November 1932 – 27 March 2018) was a French film actress. She was known for her performances in the films of her husband Claude Chabrol, including &quot;Les Biches&quot; (1968) and &quot;Le Boucher&quot; (1970), Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; (1972), and Gabriel Axel&#x27;s &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1987). The role she was mostly associated with was that of the haughty bourgeois woman.

==Biography==
Audran was born in Versailles and raised by her mother after her father, a doctor, died when she was six years old. A graduate of the Lycée Lamartine, she studied drama at the Ecole de théâtre Charles Dullin in Paris. She first appeared on stage, though with little success, and gave her film debut in the 1957 short film &quot;Le jeu de la nuit&quot;. Her first collaboration with director Chabrol was the 1959 &quot;Les Cousins&quot;, with whom she would make a total of 25 films. Having previously been married to actor Jean-Louis Trintignant, she married Chabrol in 1964. The couple had one son, actor Thomas Chabrol.

Audran&#x27;s major films with Chabrol include &quot;Les Biches&quot;, which earned her the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival, &quot;Le Boucher&quot;, &quot;Just Before Nightfall&quot; (1971), and &quot;Violette Nozière&quot; (1978), for which she won the César Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also starred in Eric Rohmer&#x27;s 1959 debut film &quot;Le Signe du Lion&quot; (released in 1962), &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot;, for which she received the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role (together with &quot;Just Before Nightfall&quot;), Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Coup de Torchon&quot;, and her internationally best known film, &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot;. In addition, Audran had supporting roles in three films of director Samuel Fuller. On TV, she appeared in productions like &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1984).

Audran and Chabrol divorced in 1980, although she continued to act in small parts in his films. She died on 27 March 2018, aged 85, following a long illness. Her son Thomas reported that his mother had been in hospital for ten days before she returned home, where she died.

<text>USS &quot;Hartford&quot;, a sloop-of-war steamer, was the first ship of the United States Navy named for Hartford, the capital of Connecticut. &quot;Hartford&quot; served in several prominent campaigns in the American Civil War as the flagship of David G. Farragut, most notably the Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864. She survived until 1956, when she sank awaiting restoration at Norfolk, Virginia.

==Service history==

===East India Squadron, 1859–1861===
&quot;Hartford&quot; was launched 22 November 1858 at the Boston Navy Yard; sponsored by Miss Carrie Downes, Miss Lizzie Stringham, and Lieutenant G. J. H. Preble; and commissioned 27 May 1859, Captain Charles Lowndes in command. After shakedown out of Boston, the new screw sloop of war, carrying Flag Officer Cornelius K. Stribling, the newly appointed commander of the East India Squadron, sailed for the Cape of Good Hope and the Far East. Upon reaching the Orient, &quot;Hartford&quot; relieved as flagship. In November she embarked the American Minister to China, John Elliott Ward, at Hong Kong and carried him to Canton, Manila, Swatow, Shanghai, and other Far Eastern ports to settle American claims and to arrange for favorable consideration of the Nation&#x27;s interests.

===Civil War, 1861–1865===

With the outbreak of the American Civil War, &quot;Hartford&quot; was ordered home. She departed the Sunda Strait with on 30 August 1861 and arrived Philadelphia on 2 December to be fitted out for wartime service. She departed the Delaware Capes on 28 January as flagship of Flag Officer David G. Farragut, the commander of the newly created West Gulf Blockading Squadron. (See also: Confederate blockade mail.)

An even larger purpose than the important blockade of the South&#x27;s Gulf Coast lay behind Farragut&#x27;s assignment. Late in 1861, the Union high command decided to capture New Orleans, the South&#x27;s richest and most populous city, to begin a drive of sea-based power up the Mississippi River to meet the Union Army which was to drive down the Mississippi valley behind a spearhead of armored gunboats. &quot;Other operations,&quot; Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles warned Farragut, &quot;must not be allowed to interfere with the great object in view—the certain capture of the city of New Orleans.&quot;

&quot;Hartford&quot; arrived 20 February at Ship Island, Mississippi, midway between Mobile Bay and the mouths of the Mississippi. Several Union ships and a few Army units were already in the vicinity when the squadron&#x27;s flagship dropped anchor at the advanced staging area for the attack on New Orleans. In ensuing weeks a mighty fleet assembled for the campaign. In mid-March Commander David Dixon Porter&#x27;s flotilla of mortar schooners arrived towed by steam gunboats.

The next task was to get Farragut&#x27;s ships across the bar, a constantly shifting mud bank at the mouth of each pass entering the Mississippi. Farragut managed to get all of his ships but across the bar and into the river where Forts St. Philip and Jackson challenged further advance. A line of hulks connected by strong barrier chains, six ships of the Confederate Navy—including ironclad and unfinished but potentially deadly ironclad , two ships of the Louisiana Navy, a group of converted river steamers called the Confederate River Defense Fleet, and a number of fire rafts also stood between Farragut and the great Southern metropolis.

On 16 April, the Union ships moved up the river to a position below the forts, and David Dixon Porter&#x27;s gunboats first exchanged fire with the Southern guns. Two days later his mortar schooners opened a heavy barrage which continued for six days. On the 21st, the squadron&#x27;s Fleet Captain, Henry H. Bell, led a daring expedition up river and, despite a tremendous fire on him, cut the chain across the river. In the early hours of 24 April, a red lantern on &quot;Hartford&quot;″s mizzen peak signaled the fleet to get underway and steam through the breach in the obstructions. As the ships closed the forts their broadsides answered a fire from the Confederate guns. Porter&#x27;s mortar schooners and gunboats remained at their stations below the southern fortifications covering the movement with rapid fire.
&quot;Hartford&quot; dodged a run by ironclad ram &quot;Manassas&quot;; then, while attempting to avoid a fireraft, grounded in the swift current near Fort St. Philip. When the burning barge was shoved alongside the flagship, only Farragut&#x27;s leadership and the training of the crew saved &quot;Hartford&quot; from being destroyed by flames which at one point engulfed a large portion of the ship. Meanwhile, the sloop&#x27;s gunners never slackened the pace at which they fired into the forts. As her firefighters snuffed out the flames, the flagship backed free of the bank.

When Farragut&#x27;s ships had run the gantlet and passed out of range of the fort&#x27;s guns, the Confederate River Defense Fleet attempted to stop their progress. In the ensuing melee, they managed to sink converted merchantman , the only Union ship lost during the night.

====Battle of New Orleans, 1862====
The next day, after silencing Confederate batteries, a few miles below New Orleans, &quot;Hartford&quot; and her sister ships anchored off the city early in the afternoon. A handful of ships and men had won a great decisive victory that secured the north, the mouth of the Mississippi river.

Early in May, Farragut ordered several of his ships up stream to clear the river and followed himself in &quot;Hartford&quot; on the 7th to join in the conquest of the valley. Defenseless, Baton Rouge and Natchez promptly surrendered to the Union ships and no significant opposition was encountered until 18 May when the Confederate commandant at Vicksburg replied to Commander Samuel P. Lee&#x27;s demand for surrender: &quot;... Mississippians don&#x27;t know and refuse to learn, how to surrender to an enemy. If Commodore Farragut or Brigadier General Butler can teach them, let them come and try.&quot;

When Farragut arrived on the scene a few days later, he learned that heavy Southern guns mounted on the bluff at Vicksburg some above the river could shell his ships while his own guns could not be elevated enough to hit them back. Since sufficient troops were not available to take the fortress by storm, the Flag Officer headed downstream on 27 May leaving gunboats to blockade it from below.

Orders awaited Farragut at New Orleans, where he arrived on 30 May, directing him to open the river and join the Western Flotilla and stating that Abraham Lincoln himself had given the task highest priority. The Flag Officer recalled Porter&#x27;s mortar schooners from Mobile, Alabama and got underway up the Mississippi in &quot;Hartford&quot; on 8 June.

====Prelude to the Vicksburg Campaign, 1862–1863====
The Union Squadron was assembled just below Vicksburg by 26 June 1862. Two days later the Union ships, their own guns blazing at rapid fire and covered by an intense barrage from the mortars, suffered little damage while running past the batteries. Flag Officer Davis, commanding the Western Flotilla, joined Farragut above Vicksburg on the 30th; but again, naval efforts to take Vicksburg were frustrated by a lack of troops. &quot;Ships,&quot; Porter commented, &quot;... cannot crawl up hills 300 feet high, and it is that part of Vicksburg which must be taken by the Army.&quot; On 22 July, Farragut received orders to return down the river at his discretion and he got underway on 24 July, reached New Orleans in four days, and after a fortnight sailed to Pensacola, Florida, for repairs.

The flagship returned to New Orleans on 9 November to prepare for further operations in the unpredictable waters of the Mississippi. The Union Army, ably supported by the Mississippi Squadron, was pressing, on Vicksburg from above, and Farragut wanted to assist in the campaign by blockading the mouth of the Red River from which supplies were pouring eastward to the Confederate Army. Meanwhile, the South had been fortifying its defenses along the river and had erected powerful batteries at Port Hudson, Louisiana.

On the night of 14 March 1863, Farragut in &quot;Hartford&quot; and accompanied by six other ships, attempted to run by these batteries. However, they encountered such heavy and accurate fire that only the flagship and , lashed alongside, succeeded in running the gauntlet. Thereafter, &quot;Hartford&quot; and her consort patrolled between Port Hudson and Vicksburg denying the Confederacy desperately needed supplies from the West.

Porter&#x27;s Mississippi Squadron, cloaked by night, dashed downstream past the Vicksburg batteries on 16 April, while General Ulysses S. Grant marched his troops overland to a new base also below the Southern stronghold. April closed with the Navy ferrying Grant&#x27;s troops across the river to Bruinsburg whence they encircled Vicksburg and forced the beleaguered fortress to surrender on 4 July.

====Battle of Mobile Bay, 1864====


With the Mississippi River now opened, Farragut turned his attention to Mobile, a Confederate industrial center still building ships and turning out war supplies. The Battle of Mobile Bay took place on 5 August 1864. Farragut, with &quot;Hartford&quot;, captained by Percival Drayton, as his flagship, led a fleet consisting of four ironclad monitors and 14 wooden vessels. The Confederate naval force was composed of newly built ram , Admiral Franklin Buchanan&#x27;s flagship, and gunboats , , and ; and backed by the powerful guns of Forts Morgan and Gaines in the Bay. From the firing of the first gun by Fort Morgan to the raising of the white flag of surrender by &quot;Tennessee&quot; little more than three hours elapsed—but three hours of terrific fighting on both sides. The Confederates had only 32 casualties, while the Union forces suffered 335 casualties, including 113 men drowned in when the monitor struck a &quot;torpedo&quot; mine and sank.

Twelve of &quot;Hartford&quot;″s sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at the Battle of Mobile Bay. These men were:
* Landsman Wilson Brown
* Ordinary Seaman Bartholomew Diggins
* Coal Heaver Richard D. Dunphy
* Coxswain Thomas Fitzpatrick

* Pilot Martin Freeman
* Coal Heaver James R. Garrison
* Landsman John Lawson
* Captain of the Forecastle John McFarland

* Ordinary Seaman Charles Melville
* Coal Heaver Thomas O&#x27;Connell
* Landsman William Pelham
* Shell Man William A. Stanley
===Prizes and adjudication===
===Pacific, 1865–1899===
Returning to New York on 13 December, &quot;Hartford&quot; decommissioned for repairs a week later. Back in shape in July 1865, she served as flagship of a newly organized Asiatic Squadron until August 1868 when she returned to New York and decommissioned. Recommissioned 9 October 1872, she resumed Asiatic Station patrol until returning home 19 October 1875. Two of her crewmen, Ordinary Seaman John Costello and Ordinary Seaman Richard Ryan, were awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing drowning shipmates in separate 1876 incidents. In 1882, as Captain Stephen B. Luce&#x27;s flagship of the North Atlantic Station, &quot;Hartford&quot; visited the Caroline Island, Hawaii, and Valparaíso, Chile, before arriving San Francisco on 17 March 1884. She then cruised in the Pacific until decommissioning 14 January 1887 at Mare Island, California, for apprentice sea-training use.

From 1890 to 1899 &quot;Hartford&quot; was laid up at Mare Island, the last five years of which she was being rebuilt.

===Training ship in the Atlantic 1899–1926===
On 2 October 1899, &quot;Harford&quot; recommissioned, then transferred to the Atlantic coast to be used for a training and cruise ship for midshipmen. In January 1903 she was reported to visit France, including Villefranche-sur-Mer and Marseille.
She served as training ship until 24 October 1912 when she was transferred to Charleston, for use as a station ship.

===Final years, 1926–1956===
Again placed out of commission 20 August 1926, &quot;Hartford&quot; remained at Charleston until moved to Washington, D.C., on 18 October 1938. President Franklin Roosevelt wanted to build a naval museum there featuring the &quot;Hartford&quot;, , and a four-stack destroyer from World War I. When Roosevelt died, plans to establish this museum and to save the ships were abandoned. On 19 October 1945, &quot;Hartford&quot; was towed to the Norfolk Navy Yard and classified as a relic. The ship was allowed to deteriorate, and as a result, &quot;Hartford&quot; sank at her berth on 20 November 1956. She proved to be beyond salvage and was subsequently dismantled.

<text>Vic Dhillon (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Brampton West—Mississauga and Brampton West.

==Background==
Dhillon has lived in Brampton, Ontario for most of his life. He has a degree in business administration from Lakehead University, and helped found a family-owned business in Mississauga after his graduation. He has done fundraising work for the Brampton Food Bank, and led a local initiative to send supplies to eastern Ontario during the ice storm of 1998. Dhillon worked as a constituency assistant to federal Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Gurbax Singh Malhi for five months after the 1993 federal election, and then worked as an executive assistant to Liberal MP Colleen Beaumier for over nine years.

==Politics==
Dhillon ran in the 1999 provincial election as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Brampton West—Mississauga. He lost to high-profile Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Tony Clement by 8,310 votes. He ran again in the 2003 election and this time defeated Clement by 2,512 votes. Most political observers considered this to be a significant upset. Strong support from the riding&#x27;s Indo-Canadian community was a factor, as was a provincial swing to the Liberals. He was elected without difficulty in 2007 in the new riding of Brampton West. He was re-elected in 2011, and 2014.

In 2004, Dhillon was credited by local residents with saving Knights Table, a non-profit diner that provides meals for Brampton&#x27;s poor and homeless. According to a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; report, Dhillon introduced the diner&#x27;s management to Jaswant Singh Birk, who in turn provided the establishment with a generous lease after its previous contract expired.

He was appointed as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Government Services on September 20, 2006.

Dhillon supported Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s bid to lead the Liberal Party of Canada in 2006. In December 2006, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to protect transient workers from exploitation by hiring agencies. The bill was endorsed by the Toronto Star in the following week.

Dhillon took part in an Ontario government business mission to India in January 2007.

Until August 2016, Dhillon served as a Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. From August 2016 to May 2018, he served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Government and Consumer Services.

Dhillon ran for re-election in Brampton West in the 2018 Ontario election. He placed third, after the Progressive Conservative and New Democratic Party candidates.

<doc id="1174153" wikidata="Q107595999" url="?curid=1174153" title="The Vatican Rag">
<text>&quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; is a ragtime parody song by American satirist Tom Lehrer. The song purports to be a response to the Second Vatican Council, a meeting that proposed reforms to the Catholic Church. First performed in 1965, it is controversial for its irreverent depiction of Catholic traditions.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; takes musical inspiration from ragtime pieces such as &quot;Spaghetti Rag&quot; (1910) and &quot;The Varsity Drag&quot; (1927). A spoken introduction describes the song as a response to the &quot;Vatican II&quot; council—which, among other things, broadened the range of music that could be used in services—and humorously proposes this rag as a more accessible alternative to traditional liturgical music. The song begins:

The lyrics mockingly list a number of Catholic rituals such as confession, the Eucharist, and Rosaries, and suggest the irony of modernizing an age-old institution like the church. Amy Richlin notes that the song is funny &quot;not only because of the words but because it&#x27;s a rag&quot;. According to Jesse David Fox of &quot;Vulture&quot;, &quot;Lehrer doesn&#x27;t just poke fun at a sacred cow, he slaughters it.&quot; Eruptions of shock and laughter can be heard in recordings as the audience reacts to both the song&#x27;s blasphemous tone and its creative rhymes.

==Composition and performances==

In the early 1960s Lehrer wrote satiric topical songs for the US version of the television show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. Inspired by the ongoing Second Vatican Council, he composed &quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; during this period, but he decided not to submit it because he thought the show would &quot;[do the song] badly or [take] out the satiric parts&quot;. He instead debuted the song at the Hungry I in San Francisco in a series of shows that were recorded for his last album, &quot;That Was the Year That Was&quot; (1965).

Lehrer later played &quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; in videotaped performances. In April 1967, he played the song on a benefit show for WNET-TV in New York, prompting hundreds of people to complain to the station. In September 1967, Lehrer included &quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; on his &quot;Live in Copenhagen&quot; TV special recorded in Denmark.

==Reception and legacy==

Some Catholics criticized &quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; as blasphemous. After one show at the Hungry I, Lehrer&#x27;s performance of the song led to a confrontation with the actor Ricardo Montalbán, who happened to be in the audience. According to a former Hungry I bouncer, Montalbán approached Lehrer in a fit of rage, yelling, &quot;I love my religion! I will die for my religion!&quot; to which Lehrer responded: &quot;Hey, no problem, as long as you don&#x27;t fight for your religion.&quot; In May 1967, a Putnam County, New York, schoolteacher used Lehrer&#x27;s &quot;Vatican Rag&quot; and &quot;National Brotherhood Week&quot; as examples of modern satire for her seventh-grade class; the outcry was such that the school board banned the songs and censured the teacher, and she quit three months later and left the area.

Conversely, fans of Lehrer consider the song one of his best compositions. &quot;Vulture&quot; included the song on its 2016 list of &quot;The 100 Jokes That Shaped Modern Comedy&quot;. &quot;Stop the Church&quot; (1991), a short documentary about an HIV/AIDS demonstration in New York City, uses the song as the background music to church services. In 2000, &quot;The Vatican Rag&quot; was the last song played by the jazz radio station WNOP before it converted to a Catholic talk format.

<text>State Road 451 (SR 451) is a controlled-access toll road connecting SR 414 (Apopka Expressway) and SR 429 (Western Expressway) north to US 441 (SR 500/Orange Blossom Trail). The entire route is within Apopka.

==Route description==
The route begins at a large interchange with SR 414 and SR 429, continuing as a north-south route. The highway then has an at-grade intersection with U.S. Route 441 (US 441; Orange Blossom Trail). The highway then continues with no intermediate interchanges to its northern terminus an at-grade intersection with Old Dixie Highway. The highway then continues north as Vick Road.

The shortest numbered route within the CFX system, SR 451 is effectively a spur route of SR 429. While the short SR 451 itself has no toll facilities, it is not possible to drive the route (excluding the Vick Road Extension) without paying tolls either on SR 414 or SR 429.

==History==
The route now designated as SR 451 was formerly SR 429. To allow the extension of SR 429 to its new terminus on US 441 as part of the Wekiva Parkway project, the road now known as SR 451 had to be given a new designation. The road originally would have been designated SR 429A, but it was changed to FL 451 in 2005. In 2012, OOCEA (predecessor to CFX) announced the new designation, which took effect in January 2013.

<text>Grammatophyllum speciosum, also called giant orchid, tiger orchid, sugar cane orchid or queen of the orchids, is a species of orchid native to Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Borneo, Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi) and Malaysia. It has also been recorded in the Philippines, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s tallest orchid, with specimens recorded up to in height.

== Description ==
It is an epiphytic and occasionally a lithophytic plant, forming spectacular root bundles. Its cylindric pseudobulbs can grow to a length of 2.5 m. It can grow to gigantic clusters weighing from several hundred kilograms to more than one ton. One collected in 1893 by Frederick K. Sander &amp; Co. near Penang Island in Malaysia weighed a long ton (=a metric ton). Half was sent to the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago and the other half to the Singapore Botanic Garden. By 1902, the Singapore specimen had grown to be in girth by ten feet (three meters) high and bore simultaneously 2090 five-inch-wide flowers plus 1110 unopened buds. Much more recently, in A.D. 2000, biologists Tim Laman and Phil Atkinson found one in Borneo wide and bearing between 2500 and 5000 flowers. The plant completely encircled the host tree above ground. The oldest individual orchid plant is also a &quot;G. speciosum&quot;. Planted in the Singapore Botanic Garden in 1861 by Garden Director Lawrence Niven and his staff, it was 154 years old in 2015. and so would now (2025) be 164 years of age. The plant is also in width.

Each raceme can grow to a height of 3m, bearing up to eighty flowers, each 10 cm wide. The flowers are yellow colored with maroon or dark red spots. These flowers are remarkable, since the lowest flowers have no lip and these flowers function as osmophores for the entire inflorescence and continue to emit chemical scent to attract pollinators as flowers open in succession. It blooms only once every two to four years. This orchid can, however, remain in bloom for up to two months. Each individual flower can remain fresh for as long as six weeks. In addition, this plant has been found to have potential medicinal benefits; for example one research article by Harikarnpakdee and Chowjarean found it specifically aided in wound healing in humans.

== Common names ==

*Giant orchid, not to be confused with &quot;Eulophia ecristata&quot; or &quot;Barlia robertiana&quot;, both of which are also commonly called the giant orchid.
*Tiger orchid, not to be confused with &quot;Rossioglossum grande&quot; or &quot;Maxillaria&quot; species, both are also called tiger orchid.
*Queen of the orchids, not to be confused with &quot;Cattleya&quot; species
*Sugar cane orchid, for its resemblance to a sugarcane plant of the genus &quot;Saccharum&quot;

== Distribution and habitat ==
It is native to New Guinea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines, growing in crotches of large trees on exposed areas of the lowland tropical rainforest.

== Ecology ==
A giant orchid weighing two tons was one of the highlights in the 1851 exhibition at the Crystal Palace in London.

Because of its enormous size, it is rarely cultivated as this species is usually too large to be accommodated in most greenhouses. Cultivated specimens of this species are always grown as terrestrials, as the plants grow as both an epiphyte and terrestrial in habitat.

<text>Cardwell is a coastal town and rural locality in the Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Cardwell had a population of 1,320 people.

== Geography ==
The Bruce Highway National Highway 1 and the North Coast railway line are the dominant transport routes; connecting with the Queensland provincial cities of Cairns and Townsville. Cardwell railway station in Bowen Street serves the town ().

The town is a long narrow strip hugging the coast with Greenwood Hill immediately to the west of the town () rising to above sea level. 

West of Cardwell the rugged topography of the Cardwell Range intercepts the trade winds resulting in high rainfall. The coastal escarpment is covered in rainforest which transitions to the west to eucalypt woodland and tropical savanna. Cardwell Range biodiversity has been protected by the introduction of Forestry Reserves, National Parks and Queensland World Heritage Wet Tropics Areas.

Seaward lies the Hinchinbrook Channel () and Rockingham Bay () which are both are part of the Coral Sea. The Great Barrier Reef is further off-shore to the east.

Islands are visible from Cardwell including protected areas i.e. Hinchinbrook Island, Goold Island and the Brook Islands Group.

Oyster Point is one kilometre south of Cardwell (). This location experienced one of Australia&#x27;s important conservation battles. With the establishment of Port Hinchinbrook, the Marina Public Boat Ramp provides year-round access to the protected marine environments of Hinchinbrook Channel, Estuaries, Islands and Great Barrier Reef. The Cardwell Jetty is an important infrastructure asset, where visitors can socialize and view the coastal scenery; and anglers can enjoy both day and evening fishing activities.

== History ==
The Aboriginal heritage is defined by Language Groups; the boundary of the Dyirbal and Warrgamay lies between Cardwell and Tully in the north.

&quot;Warrgamay&quot; (also known as &quot;Waragamai&quot;, &quot;Wargamay&quot;, &quot;Wargamaygan&quot;, &quot;Biyay&quot;, and &quot;Warakamai&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North Queensland. The language region includes the Herbert River area, Ingham, Hawkins Creek, Long Pocket, Herbert Vale, Niagara Vale, Yamanic Creek, Herbert Gorge, Cardwell, Hinchinbrook Island and the adjacent mainland.

Girramay (also known as Giramay, Garamay, Giramai, Keramai) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around Herbert River Catchment taking in the towns of Cardwell and Ingham. The Girramay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Cassowary Coast and Hinchinbrook Regional Councils.

The first Europeans settled in the area in January 1864 in order to create a port initially called &quot;Port Hinchinbrook&quot;. Subsequently, the town was renamed Cardwell later in 1864 by explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple after Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell, the Secretary of State for the Colonies at that time.

Cardwell was the first port settlement on the Queensland coast north of Port Denison (Bowen). The first party of non-indigenous people to settle at Rockingham Bay arrived in January 1864 and was led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple. They were 20 in number including James Morrill, William Alcock Tully, botanist John Dallachy, Arthur Jervoise Scott, Lieut. Marlow of the Native Police and his troopers Norman, Archy and Warbragen. Dalrymple also brought his &quot;black boy&quot; servant, an Aboriginal man from Stradbroke Island that he called &quot;Cockey&quot;. They came from Bowen on the small schooner &quot;Policeman&quot; which was under the command of ex-Native Police officer Captain Walter Powell, with the 3 ton cutter Heather Bell in tow.

Dalrymple&#x27;s main purpose in establishing a settlement in Rockingham Bay was to create a port as close as possible to the Valley of Lagoons Station of which he was part owner. Very soon after disembarking from the &quot;Policeman&quot;, he endeavoured to create a road from the coast to the Valley of Lagoons largely by expanding already existing native paths. A few miles inland from the landing site was an Aboriginal village and bora ground surrounded by native banana plantations that reminded Dalrymple of villages in Ceylon. The Warrgamay people in the area and on nearby Hinchinbrook Island were described as numerous and having some of the largest spears, shields and wooden swords ever recorded in Australia. Having told the local people through his interpreter that he had come to take possession of their lands, Dalrymple bizarrely expressed frustration at the supposed inability of the aboriginals to understand the concept of &quot;Thou shalt not steal&quot;. James Morrill was more factual in his account of the founding of Cardwell writing that &quot;I then said to [the natives] that they must clear out ... as we wished to occupy the land and would shoot any who approached, that we were strong and that another party would soon follow&quot;, and he also described how a group of Aboriginals &quot;were set upon suddenly by Dalrymple&#x27;s men and rather cut up.&quot;

Cardwell Post Office opened on 10 July 1864.

In March 1865, Lieutenant Blakeney and seven troopers of the Native Police spent two days clearing the area around Cardwell of Aboriginal presence by &quot;burning camps and dispersing the natives.&quot;

In the late 1860s and early 1870s, Cardwell became a transport hub for prospectors heading to the Etheridge Shire goldfields inland from the town. Captain John Moresby visited Cardwell in 1871 and wrote that &quot;various tribes of aborigines roam about the vicinity, and not unnaturally regard the white men, who are rapidly dispossessing them of their homes, as mortal enemies. They ... suffer terrible retaliation at the hands of our countrymen, who employ native troopers, commanded by white men to hunt down and destroy the offenders when the opportunity offers&quot;.

In January 1872, two British dugong fishermen named Henry Smith and Charles Clements were killed at nearby Goold Island by resident Aboriginals. Wet weather prevented an immediate punitive expedition of four boats of armed local white men who were eager that &quot;the blacks&quot; be &quot;taught that what they do is punishable by death&quot;. However, within the same month the Native Police forces of Sub-Inspectors Crompton and Johnstone completed a punitive mission and returned to Cardwell with three young Aboriginal children from the island. The eldest of the children was ten and &quot;they were given away in Cardwell to domesticate them.&quot;

Cardwell Provisional School opened on 1 October 1870, becoming Cardwell State School on 22 August 1887.

Murray River Provisional School opened circa 1893 and closed in 1904. Its location was described as &quot;via Cardwell&quot;.

In 1985, it was proposed to build an integrated marina and resort called Port Hinchinbrook at Oyster Point south of the town. The proposal encountered many environmental objections and financial collapse of one of the development companies, before construction commenced in 1999. The long-running controversy led to the Australian Senate establishing an inquiry in May 1998 to try to understand the roles of the regulatory processes of the three levels of government in the approval for the development and what might be learned from the experience and how processes might be improved.

The Cardwell Library opened in 2008.

Cardwell suffered significant damage from Cyclone Yasi, a category 5 cyclone, in February 2011. The marina and the boats within it were destroyed. As at 2019, ongoing legal disputes have prevented work on rebuilding the marina.

In 2013, the Cardwell community began being the target of an online hoax, which claimed the town&#x27;s Christmas lights competition had been cancelled to appease the local Muslim community, forcing Cassowary Coast Regional Council to publicly debunk the rumours. Despite this, the hoax continues to circulate on social media. The hoax originated from an Islamophobic post on the &quot;Meanwhile in Australia&quot; Facebook page, which subsequently went viral. The post detailing the bogus information specifically named the Al Shalalah mosque as the source of the complaint, but such a mosque does not exist in Cardwell. The information contained within the post was also debunked by fact-checking websites such as snopes.com and Hoax Slayer. Although the original post was deleted, screenshots of the post continue to be shared on social media. Contrary to the sentiment shared in the fake post, the then Cassowary Coast mayor Bill Shannon said that he had received phone calls from Muslim leaders from as far away as Sydney encouraging Cardwell to continue with their Christmas light displays.

<text>Woden Valley () is a district in the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. The district is subdivided into divisions (suburbs), sections and blocks.

The name of Woden Valley is taken from the name of a nearby homestead owned by James Murray who named the homestead in October 1837 after the Old English god of wisdom, Woden. He named it this as he was to spend his life in the pursuit of wisdom. However, historian Harold Koch considers that the name may have its origins in the Aboriginal word for possum, either &quot;wadyan&quot; or &quot;wadhan&quot;, influenced in interpretation by the term known to English speakers of &#x27;Woden&#x27;.

In 1964 it was the first satellite city to be built, separate from the district of Canberra Central. It has its own shopping centre, employment opportunities and accommodation with twelve suburbs arranged around the Woden Town Centre. At the , the population of the district was .

==Establishment and governance==

Following the transfer of land from the Government of New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government in 1911, the district was established in 1966 by the Commonwealth via the gazettal of the &quot;Districts Ordinance 1966&quot; (Cth) which, after the enactment of the &quot;Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act&quot; 1988, became the &quot;Districts Act&quot; 1966. This Act was subsequently repealed by the ACT Government and the district is now administered subject to the &quot;Districts Act&quot; 2002.

==Representation==
Woden Valley is represented by:
* ACT Legislative Assembly: The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was granted self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1988 with the passage of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. The first Assembly was elected in 1989. There are currently 25 members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Members are elected every four years by the people of the ACT to represent them and make decisions on their behalf. The ACT Legislative Assembly has five multi-member electorates: Yerrabi; Ginninderra; Kurrajong; Murrumbidgee and; Brindabella, each electing five members.
* Woden Valley Community Council: Woden Valley Community Council (WVCC) engages as widely as possible with the Woden community on a range of issues that affect the Woden community. The council is recognised by and engages with the ACT Government on behalf of Woden residents. The WVCC Is not a local government.

==Location and urban structure==
The district is a set of contiguous residential suburbs that surround the Woden Town Centre, which includes a major shopping centre, called Westfield Woden, or more commonly known as &quot;Woden Plaza&quot;. Woden is also home to the tallest building in Canberra, Lovett Tower, which stands at 22 stories. Lovett Tower and a number of other buildings host staff from Australian Government agencies; there is also some light industrial development in the town centre.

Within the district are a number of community facilities including the campus of the Canberra College, a secondary school catering to years 11 and 12 (16 – 18 years old); a library, the Woden Youth Centre, and the Canberra Hospital, which is located in the north of the district.

==Early homesteads==

In the mid-1920s following World War I, much of the Woden Valley was granted to returned soldiers under the soldier settlement lease scheme. Four of the earliest homesteads established in the valley were Yamba, Yarra Glen, Melrose and Illoura.

Yamba. In 1920, Walter Eddison was granted a soldier settlement lease on the Woden Block 132, covering roughly the present-day suburbs of Phillip and Swinger Hill. In 1925, he applied for an additional block and was granted the Woden Block 28A, which extended further south covering the present-day suburbs of Pearce and Torrens. Walter initially continued to live at his property &quot;The Oaks&quot; in Queanbeyan while farming his new property, but then established his homestead Yamba on the property in 1926 and worked the land with his three sons, Tom, Keith and Jack. In 1929, were withdrawn from block 28A for the construction of the Woden Cemetery (Woden Block 30). Walter&#x27;s three sons all fought overseas during World War II, and sadly all three were killed and buried overseas. The Yamba homestead was located in the vicinity of present-day 11 Irving Street, Phillip. Eddison Park in Woden is named in honour of the Eddison family. The main north–south arterial road passing to the east of central Woden was named Yamba Drive in honour of the former property.

Yarra Glen. Frank Gifford was granted a soldier settler lease on the Woden Block 32 in 1920, and a lease on the adjacent Block 39 in 1922, and named his property Yarra Glenn. In August 1925, the two blocks were merged to become the smaller Block 27A, which extended from the vicinity of the present-day Royal Australian Mint south to include the present-day suburb of Hughes. In 1927, Gifford sold the lease to George Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell of Duntroon. George worked the property with his two sons, Robert and Curtis. The Yarra Glen homestead was located near the intersection of present-day Carruthers Street and Yarra Glen, Curtin. The large conifer on the Yarra Glen median strip near the Carruthers Street overpass was once part of the homestead garden, and the row of large trees to the left (east) of the southbound Yarra Glen offramp were originally a windbreak for the homestead&#x27;s garden. The main parkway connecting Woden Valley with central Canberra, constructed in 1966, was named Yarra Glenn after the former property.

Melrose. Jack Maguire was granted a 10-year soldier settler lease for the Woden Block 25A in 1926. His block covered much of present-day suburbs of Curtin, Lyons and Chifley. He initially called his property Oakey Hill and used it solely for grazing sheep. He built a home on the property in 1927, and renamed the property &quot;Melrose&quot;. There is a sign marking the location of the former homestead on the pathway between present-day Theodore Street and James Place, Curtin. Maguire farmed Melrose until 1963 when the land was resumed by the government to establish suburbs in Woden Valley. Melrose Drive and Melrose High School were named after the Maguire&#x27;s property.

Illoura. Thomas Cargill was offered a ten-year soldier settlement lease for the Woden Block 26A in 1926, which extended from present-day Curtin and Lyons across to present-day North Weston to the west. In 1928 he sold his lease to Guy Tanner, and the Tanner family continued to farm the area until the property was resumed in the early 1970s. Illoura homestead was located between present-day Tuggeranong Parkway and the edge of the present-day suburb of Curtin, in what is currently known as the Illoura agistment paddocks. The homestead was located just to the southeast of the Tuggeranong Parkway / Cotter Road intersection. A clump of large eucalyptus trees still visible to the left of where the southbound onramp meets the Parkway marks the former location of the homestead.

==Residential development==
In the early 1960s the National Capital Development Commission developed plans to establish 10 suburbs in the Woden Valley to house an estimated 55,000 residents. Work commenced on the first two suburbs, Hughes and Curtin, in late-1962. Some of the first homes built in Curtin were advertised for £6,870 to £8,055. Hughes was officially declared open on 9 May 1964. Chifley and Lyons were the next suburbs to be developed (1965), followed by Garran, Pearce and Torrens (1966), Mawson, Farrer and Phillip (1966), O&#x27;Malley (1973) and Isaacs (1986).

By late-1965, in the earlier stages of Woden Valley&#x27;s development, there were complaints from local residents that the new suburbs lacked shopping and recreational facilities, and the first schools in the area, such as Curtin Primary, were overcrowded as surrounding suburbs were developed.

The first section of Hindmarsh Drive, connecting Woden Valley with Fyshwick and South Canberra, opened in December 1966. Yarra Glen, connecting Woden Valley with the City, opened in November 1967.

==Demographics==

At the , there were people in the Woden Valley district, of these 48.7 per cent were male and 51.3 per cent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.4 per cent of the population, which was lower than the national and territory averages. The median age of people in the Woden Valley district was 39 years, which was slightly higher than the national median of 38 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 17.4 per cent of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 18.5 per cent of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 50.4 per cent were married and 10.1 per cent were either divorced or separated. The median weekly income for residents within the Woden Valley district was significantly higher than the national average, and similar to the territory average.

At the 2021 census, the most common ancestries reported in the Woden Valley area were English (31.7 per cent), Australian (29.4 per cent), Irish (12.9 per cent), Scottish (10.7 per cent) and Indian (4.9 per cent). 40.3 per cent of residents described themselves as having &quot;No Religion&quot;, higher than the national average at 38.4 per cent. Households in the Woden Valley district had a slightly higher than average proportion (27.5 per cent) where a language other than English was spoken at home (national average was 24.8 per cent); and a slightly lower proportion (71.0 per cent) where only English was spoken at home (national average was 72.0 per cent).

=== Sport ===
Woden Valley is a vital area when it comes to sport in the Territory. Its association football club, Woden Valley FC (Woden Rival), is very popular amongst juniors. Woden Valley also has a rugby league team Woden Rams and an Australian rules football team (Woden Blues). It also has a tenpin bowling centre and produced NSW champion and award-winning sports journalist Reagan Murphy, who lived in Garran and attended Woden Valley High School in the 1970s.

==Natural disasters==

===Bushfires===

While the majority of the destruction caused by the 2003 Canberra bushfires occurred in the Weston Creek district, in the Woden Valley suburbs of Curtin, three houses were destroyed; in Lyons, four houses; and in Torrens, two houses. Curtin, in particular, has been threatened by bushfires several times since its construction.

===Floods===

On Australia Day in 1971 a flash flood at Yarra Glen killed seven people. The drains and roads in the area have since been redesigned to avoid future flood casualties.

<text>Cul de canard (CDC) (French for &quot;duck bottom&quot;) are the feathers from the back of a duck directly around the preen gland (uropygial gland); they are very buoyant due to preen oil produced by the preen gland. They are used when tying dry flies for fly fishing. They owe their buoyancy to their proximity to the ducks preen gland which secretes an oil distributed by the duck as a cleaning and waterproofing measure. It is unnecessary for the angler to add additional oil by way of floatant. Flies incorporating CDC are easy to dress requiring no floatant and popular with anglers and trout alike.

==History==
The use of CDC&#x27;s in fly fishing originated from the Jura Mountains during the 1920s where fly fishermen used this feather in dry flies to aid buoyancy in a particular pattern called Moustique. It took until the 1980s for popular use of this feather within a whole range of patterns.

== Biography ==

Melanie Therese Shanahan, performed in Sydney from the mid-1970s. She was influenced by political singer-songwriters, in particular Sweet Honey in the Rock. She had no formal singing lessons. Shanahan moved to Hobart, to participate in the environmentalist movement, where she formed a female a cappella band, Arramaieda (a.k.a. Aramieeda), in the mid-1980s. They were named for an aboriginal woman, &quot;who lived on Bruny Island (off the Tasmanian coast). [Wace recalled] &#x27;She was a great singer and had a lot of strength and vitality&#x27;.&quot; The group began as an irregular ensemble with nine or ten members. In 1988 they recorded and produced, &quot;A capella group Aramieeda [Arramaieda] 10 songs&quot;, by the line-up of Shanahan, Rachel Hore, Deborah Wace, plus Ruth, Heather and Trish (surnames not recorded). It was recorded at The Sound Cellar, Hobart and issued via LINC Tasmania as an audiocassette.

By 1990 the line-up was a trio, comprising Shanahan together with Rachel Hore and Deborah Wace. They recorded 12 tracks at the ABC studios in December, which &quot;received national airplay&quot;: they followed with an Australian tour including an impromptu appearance at the Adelaide Fringe Festival. Mike Jackson of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; caught their gig at a local venue, Tilley Devine&#x27;s Cafe Gallery, in April 1990, and observed that their music, &quot;is full of lovely harmonies and a selection of songs that places them somewhere between The Flying Pickets and Sydney women&#x27;s a&#x27;capella group Blindman&#x27;s Holiday. More folk than the former and more up tempo than the latter.&quot;

Arramaieda released their studio album, &quot;More Ways than One&quot;, in 1992 via Natural Symphonies, which was recorded by a four-piece: Shanahan, Hore, Teresa Castley and Kirsten MacKenzie at Studios 301, Sydney in June of that year. Six of 14 tracks are written by Shanahan: Karen Fredericks of &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot; felt, &quot;each shines like a jewel. &#x27;Flying Away from You&#x27; and &quot;The Sea&quot; draw on nature as a source of inner peace in a world in which it has become difficult &#x27;to know what to feel&#x27;. The chorus of &#x27;Troubled Souls&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;m teaching my heart to sing&#x27;, is an affirmation, and &#x27;Struggle and Survive&#x27;, with the uplifting &#x27;She will not lose&#x27; motif, is a dedication to women who fight for freedom.&quot; During August–September 1992 Arramaieda toured with Kev Carmody. By 1995 Teresa Castley had been replaced by a new member, the Mauritius-born singer Pascale Rose; in this line-up the band also featured on Carmody&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Images &amp; Illusions&quot;, however in the same year Shanahan&#x27;s mental health issues led to the break-up of the band.

Shanahan relocated to Melbourne to join the acclaimed vocal group Coco&#x27;s Lunch, who she performed regularly with until parting ways a couple of years later. Her need to sing politically relevant music led to joining, Akasa, contributing tracks to their first two albums. Their debut self-titled album appeared in 1999, which was &quot;recorded, mixed and mastered&quot; by Ross Cockle (Mother Goose, Australian Crawl, Beargarden) with the line-up of Shanahan, Diana Clark, Vicki King and Andrea Watson. Their second album, &quot;World Citizen&quot; (March 2002), had Shanahan and King joined by Heidi Bradburn and Mihi Rangi; it was co-produced by the group with Siiri Metsar via Black Market Music . Dieter Bajzek of Folk Alliance Australia observed, &quot;Finally a full-length, well recorded and mastered CD... from this polished and hard-working female a cappella quartet, supported by tasteful percussion. Great original songs (except two trad. items from NZ and Africa)... covering worthy and interesting topics.&quot;

She also directed four choirs, including Living Out Loud, The Boîte Millennium Chorus, and Yirriba. Melanie Shanahan committed suicide at the age of 39. A memorial concert was held in suburban, Eltham in early December. As of February 2005, Akasa had continued with the line-up of Bradburn, Clark, King and Watson: they finished their set list with &quot;Shanahan&#x27;s &#x27;Walk with Me&#x27; [which] radiated a serene, hymn-like quality that made them especially poignant. Shanahan was one of the founding members of Akasa, and [the song] served not only as a heartfelt conclusion to the concert, but a fitting tribute to a woman who embodied so many of the qualities that still resonate in the group&#x27;s music.&quot;. Shanahan was later commemorated in separate songs by the U.K.&#x27;s Rory McLeod and Australia&#x27;s Carl Cleves.

<text>Torstar Corporation is a Canadian mass media company which primarily publishes news. In addition to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, its flagship and namesake, Torstar also publishes daily newspapers in Hamilton, Peterborough, Niagara Region, and Waterloo Region In addition to the Metroland Media Group and a minority position on Canadian Press. The corporation was initially established in 1958 to take over operations of the &quot;Star&quot; from the Atkinson Foundation after a provincial law banned charitable organizations from owning for-profit entities. From 1958 to 2020, the class A shares of Torstar were held by the families of the original Atkinson Foundation trustees. The private investment firm NordStar Capital LP, now owned by Jordan Bitove, acquired the company in 2020.

== History ==

Torstar was founded after the Ontario government passed a law barring the provisions of late-&quot;Toronto Star&quot; owner Joseph Atkinson&#x27;s will from being enacted. Atkinson had bequeathed the newspaper to a charitable organization he had founded. The Progressive Conservative provincial government of George Drew passed a law banning charitable organizations from operating profitable entities such as newspapers. Rather than sell the newspaper, the trustees of the Atkinson Foundation bought out the Star privately and founded Torstar as a private corporation.

On November 26, 2010, it was announced that the Canadian Press news agency would be taken over by a for-profit corporation, with Torstar serving as one of its investors.
On November 27, 2017, Postmedia and Torstar announced a transaction in which Postmedia would sell seven dailies, eight community papers, and the Toronto and Vancouver &quot;24 Hours&quot; to Torstar, in exchange for 22 community papers and the Ottawa and Winnipeg versions of &quot;Metro&quot;. Except for the &quot;Exeter Times-Advocate&quot;, &quot;St. Catharines Standard&quot;, &quot;Niagara Falls Review&quot;, &quot;Peterborough Examiner&quot;, and &quot;Welland Tribune&quot;, all acquired papers were to be closed. Torstar stated that it wanted to focus on building synergies within its existing markets served. The swaps effectively remove competition between the two companies in the affected markets; the Competition Bureau stated that it would review the proposed deal. and in March 2018, formally accused the companies of using no-compete clauses to reduce competition in the newspaper industry, in violation of the &quot;Competition Act&quot;.
On December 20, 2018, Torstar applied to the Ontario Superior Court for an order to keep documents seized from its offices by the Competition Bureau sealed from the public.

== Sale to NordStar ==

=== Initial NordStar proposal ===

On May 26, 2020, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; publisher John Honderich announced the sale of Torstar to Nordstar Capital LP, for $52 million. The price for the class A voting shares and class B non-voting shares was set at 63 cents in the deal. At the time of the most recent quarter, Torstar had $69 million in cash on its balance sheet – more than the $52-million acquisition price from Nordstar. However, Torstar&#x27;s share price had suffered from the company&#x27;s inability to generate enough revenue or cost savings to pay quarterly dividends, which were suspended late in 2019. The suspension pushed the publicly traded B shares to what was then the lowest level since at least the late 1990s — 53 cents. Weeks prior to the announcement of the deal, Torstar had reported a $23.5-million loss for the first quarter of 2020.

The new owners planned to make Torstar a private company with former Premier of Ontario David Peterson as chair of the board.

=== NordStar revised proposal and final sale ===

On July 11, the NordStar bid was increased to $60 million, or 74 cents per share, with the Voting Trust and Fairfax revising their soft lock-up agreements, to hard lock-ups. This effectively put an end to the bidding process because the terms of the revised bid meant that &quot;the Voting Trust and Fairfax can&#x27;t change their votes to support any other bid&quot;.

In the shareholder vote held on July 21, 99.7% of the class A shareholders favoured the NordStar offer as did 98.1% class B shareholders. However, only 81.9% of minority shareholders (not including the Voting Trust or Fairfax Financial) voted to accept the NordStar offer. On July 23, Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP, an international corporate law firm representing Torstar, brought forth a motion on behalf of Torstar before Ontario Superior Court Justice Gilmore to approve Torstar&#x27;s plan of arrangement with respect to the acquisition of Torstar. Grant Vingoe, chair of the Ontario Securities Commission, had previously said in a letter to Andrea Horvath that the court was the appropriate venue to challenge the proposal. He further said that the test to be applied by the court was whether the process leading to the arrangement was fair and reasonable.
On July 25, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; published an interview with Butch Folland, a significant member of Torstar&#x27;s voting trust and the great grandson of the founder of Torstar, Joseph E. Atkinson, Torstar&#x27;s original publisher and the author of the Atkinson Principles. Folland is also the grandson of Harry Hindmarsh, who was President of the Star following Atkinson&#x27;s death in 1948. His personal ties to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; date back to age 13 when he took a job as an office boy. In that article. Folland is quoted as saying, &quot;I was really disappointed in the outcome. I felt that the process wasn&#x27;t really fair in the way it affected me.&quot;

Late in the evening on July 27, an Ontario court approved the $60-million takeover of Torstar Corp. by private equity firm NordStar Capital LP over the objections of a rival bidding group, which immediately said it planned to appeal the judge&#x27;s decision. Ontario Superior Court Justice Cory Gilmore ruled NordStar, could close their purchase of Torstar,

== Operations ==

=== Daily News Brands ===

The Daily News Brands division primarily comprises the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and its associated properties, including Torstar Syndication Services. The division also owns The Hamilton Spectator, the Waterloo Region Record, the St. Catharines Standard, the Niagara Falls Review, the Welland Tribune, and the Peterborough Examiner.
The &quot;StarMetro&quot; chain of free daily newspapers serving Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Toronto, and Vancouver was also part of this division until publication of those titles ceased in 2019.

=== Community Brands ===

The Community Brands division, Metroland Media Group, owns more than 70 weekly community papers as of late May 2020, the free magazine &quot;Canadian Immigrant&quot;, and other community-oriented properties.

=== VerticalScope ===
On July 29, 2015, Torstar announced its acquisition of a 56% majority stake in VerticalScope, a Toronto-based owner of online communities, for $200 million. VerticalScope operates numerous websites and internet discussion message boards dedicated to various topics. Torstar CEO David Holland explained that the purchase was designed to bolster the company&#x27;s presence in digital media.

As of June 2021, VerticalScope was taken public and through an IPO and is now publicly traded under the ticker FORA on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As part of that IPO, Torstar ceased owning VerticalScope.

=== Star Touch and ePaper apps ===

Launched in 2015, Toronto Star Touch was the company&#x27;s app designed specifically for tablet computers. It was discontinued in late July 2017 after an investment totaling $20 million because of an inadequate volume of readers and advertisers and was replaced by universal apps available for both Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.

=== Management ===

The following is a list of past presidents and CEOs of Torstar:
* Beland Honderich 1966–1988 (as president), 1976–1988 (as CEO and chair)
* David R. Jolley 1988–1994
* David A. Galloway 1988–2002
* J. Robert S. Prichard 2002–2009
* David P. Holland 2009–2017
* Neil Oliver 2022–present

== Other investments ==

Torstar owns a 20 per cent stake in the Victoria, British Columbia-based newspaper publisher Black Press. The company is also part owner of The Canadian Press.

=== Past investments ===

Torstar launched a weekly celebrity-based magazine called &quot;Scoop&quot; in 2005, which folded one year later.

Between late 2005 and early 2011, Torstar also held a 20 per cent stake in CTVglobemedia, a Canadian media company which broke up when BCE Inc., the parent company of Bell Canada, purchased the company&#x27;s media assets. This caused some controversy because CTVgm owned &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, a competing newspaper to Torstar&#x27;s own &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. There were no editorial hurdles between the two newspapers however. Torstar sold its shares in 2011.

On May 2, 2014, Torstar announced the sale of Harlequin Enterprises, a publisher of romance novels, to HarperCollins for $415 million.

<doc id="1174172" wikidata="Q1422221" url="?curid=1174172" title="Current loop">
<text>In electrical signalling an analog current loop is used where a device must be monitored or controlled remotely over a pair of conductors. Only one current level can be present at any time.

A major application of current loops is the industry de facto standard 4–20 mA current loop for process control applications, where they are extensively used to carry signals from process instrumentation to proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). They are also used to transmit controller outputs to the modulating field devices such as control valves. These loops have the advantages of simplicity and noise immunity, and have a large international user and equipment supplier base. Some 4–20 mA field devices can be powered by the current loop itself, removing the need for separate power supplies, and the &quot;smart&quot; Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART) Protocol uses the loop for communications between field devices and controllers. Various automation protocols may replace analog current loops, but 4–20 mA is still a principal industrial standard.

==Process control 4–20 mA loops==
In industrial process control, analog 4–20 mA current loops are commonly used for electronic signalling, with the two values of 4 and 20 mA representing 0–100% of the range of measurement or control. These loops are used both for carrying sensor information from field instrumentation and carrying control signals to the process modulating devices, such as a valve.

The key advantages of the current loop are:
* The loop can often power the remote device, with power supplied by the controller, thus removing need for power cabling. Many instrumentation manufacturers produce 4–20 mA sensors which are &quot;loop powered&quot;.
* The &quot;live&quot; or &quot;elevated&quot; zero of 4 mA allows powering of the device even with no process signal output from the field transmitter. 
* The accuracy of the signal is not affected by voltage drop in the interconnecting wiring.
* It has high noise immunity, as it is low-impedance circuit, usually through twisted-pair conductors.
* It is self-monitoring; currents less than 3.8 mA or more than 20.5 mA are taken to indicate a fault.
* It can be carried over long cables up to the limit of the resistance for the voltage used.
* Inline displays can be inserted and powered by the loop, as long as total allowable loop resistance is not exceeded.
* Easy conversion to voltage using a resistor.
* Loop-powered &quot;I to P&quot; (current to pressure) converters can convert the 4–20 mA signal to a 3–15 psi pneumatic output for control valves, allowing easy integration of 4–20 mA signals into existing pneumatic plant.

Field instrumentation measurements include pressure, temperature, level, flow, pH or other process variables. A current loop can also be used to control a valve positioner or other output actuator. Since input terminals of instruments may have one side of the current loop input tied to the chassis ground (earth), analog isolators may be required when connecting several instruments in series.

The relationship between current value and process variable measurement is set by calibration, which assigns different ranges of engineering units to the span between 4 and 20 mA. The mapping between engineering units and current can be inverted, so that 4 mA represents the maximum and 20 mA the minimum.

===Active and passive devices===
Depending on the source of current for the loop, devices may be classified as &quot;active&quot; (supplying or &quot;sourcing&quot; power) or &quot;passive&quot; (relying on or &quot;sinking&quot; loop power). For example, a chart recorder may provide loop power to a pressure transmitter. The pressure transmitter modulates the current on the loop to send the signal to the strip chart recorder, but does not in itself supply power to the loop and so is passive. Another loop may contain two passive chart recorders, a passive pressure transmitter, and a 24 V battery (the battery is the active device). Note that a &quot;4-wire&quot; instrument has a power-supply input separate from the current loop.

Panel mount displays and chart recorders are commonly termed &quot;indicator devices&quot; or &quot;process monitors&quot;. Several passive indicator devices may be connected in series, but a loop must have only one transmitter device and only one power source (active device).

===Evolution of analogue control signals===
The 4–20 mA convention was born in the 1950s out of the earlier highly successful 3–15 psi pneumatic control signal standard, when electronics became cheap and reliable enough to emulate the older standard electrically. The 3–15 psi standard had the same features of being able to power some remote devices, and have a &quot;live&quot; zero. However, the 4–20 mA standard was better suited to the electronic controllers being developed at the time.

The transition was gradual and has extended into the 21st century, due to the huge installed base of 3–15 psi devices. As the operation of pneumatic valves over motorised valves has many cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation is still an industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4–20 mA is generated by the controller, but allows the use of pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually local to the control valve and convert 4–20 mA to 3–15 psi (or 0.2–1.0 bar). This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or, more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. The positioner is a dedicated controller which has a mechanical linkage to the actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position. It also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation.

With the development of cheap industrial micro-processors, &quot;smart&quot; valve positioners have become available since the mid-1980s and are very popular for new installations. These include an I to P converter, plus valve position and condition monitoring. These latter are fed back over the current loop to the controller, using protocols such as HART.

==Long circuits==
Analog current loops were historically occasionally carried between buildings by dry pairs in telephone cables leased from the local telephone company. 4–20 mA loops were more common in the days of analog telephony. These circuits require end-to-end direct current (DC) continuity, and unless a dedicated wire pair was hardwired, their use ceased with the introduction of semiconductor switching. DC continuity is not available over a microwave radio, optical fibre, or a multiplexed telephone circuit connection. 
Basic DC circuit theory shows that the current is the same all along the line. It was common to see 4–20 mA circuits that had loop lengths in miles or circuits working over telephone cable pairs that were longer than ten thousand feet end-to-end. There are still legacy systems in place using this technology. In Bell System circuits, voltages up to 125 VDC were employed.

==Discrete control==
Discrete control functions can be represented by discrete levels of current sent over a loop. This would allow multiple control functions to be operated over a single pair of wires. Currents required for a specific function vary from one application or manufacturer to another. There is no specific current that is tied to a single meaning. It is almost universal that 0 mA indicates the circuit has failed. In the case of a fire alarm, 6 mA could be normal, 15 mA could mean a fire has been detected, and 0 mA would produce a trouble indication, telling the monitoring site the alarm circuit had failed. Some devices, such as two-way radio remote control consoles, can reverse the polarity of currents and can multiplex audio onto a DC current.

These devices can be employed for any remote control need a designer might imagine. For example, a current loop could actuate an evacuation siren or command synchronized traffic signals.

===Two-way radio use===
Current loop circuits are one possible way used to control radio base stations at distant sites. The two-way radio industry calls this type of remote control DC remote. This name comes from the need for DC circuit continuity between the control point and the radio base station. A current loop remote control saves the cost of extra pairs of wires between the operating point and the radio transceiver. Some equipment, such as the Motorola MSF-5000 base station, uses currents below 4 mA for some functions. An alternative type, the tone remote, is more complex but requires only an audio path between control point and base station.

For example, a taxi dispatch base station might be physically located on the rooftop of an eight-story building. The taxi company office might be in the basement of a different building nearby. The office would have a remote control unit that would operate the taxi company base station over a current loop circuit. The circuit would normally be over a telephone line or similar wiring. Control function currents come from the remote control console at the dispatch office end of a circuit. In two-way radio use, an idle circuit would normally have no current present.

In two-way radio use, radio manufacturers use different currents for specific functions. Polarities are changed to get more possible functions over a single circuit. For example, imagine one possible scheme where the presence of these currents cause the base station to change state:

* no current means &quot;receive on channel 1&quot;, (the default).
* +6 mA might mean &quot;transmit on channel 1&quot; 
* −6 mA might mean &quot;stay in receive mode but switch to channel 2&quot;. So long as the −6 mA current were present, the remote base station would continue to receive on channel 2. 
* −12 mA might command the base station to &quot;transmit on channel 2&quot;.

This circuit is polarity-sensitive. If a telephone company cable splicer accidentally reversed the conductors, selecting channel 2 would lock the transmitter on.

Each current level could close a set of contacts, or operate solid-state logic, at the other end of the circuit. That contact closure caused a change of state on the controlled device. Some remote control equipment could have options set to allow compatibility between manufacturers. That is, a base station that was configured to transmit with a +18 mA current could have options changed to (instead) make it transmit when +6 mA was present.

In two-way radio use, AC signals were also present on the circuit pair. If the base station were idle, receive audio would be sent over the line from the base station to the dispatch office. In the presence of a transmit command current, the remote control console would send audio to be transmitted. The voice of the user in the dispatch office would be modulated and superimposed over the DC current that caused the transmitter to operate.

<text>State Road 536 (SR 536), named World Center Drive for its entire length, is an east-west state highway that extends from Interstate 4 (I-4) near the EPCOT theme park to SR 535 in Lake Buena Vista, with the road continuing east to SR 417 (The Central Florida GreeneWay) and International Drive.

==Route description==

SR 536 begins at an interchange with I-4/SR 400 in Lake Buena Vista, with the road continuing west into the Walt Disney World Resort as Epcot Center Drive and providing access to the EPCOT theme park section of Disney World. From this interchange it heads east as six-lane divided World Center Drive, passing by two resort hotels and a golf course before intersecting with SR 535. At this intersection, SR 536 ends, with World Center Drive continuing east to International Drive and providing access to an interchange with northbound SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay), with the westbound lanes coming from a southbound exit of the Greeneway.

==History==
SR 536 was built in the early 1980s to serve the new EPCOT theme park, opened October 1, 1982. After the road was finished, all the land for it that had formerly been part of the Walt Disney World Resort was de-annexed from the City of Lake Buena Vista and the Reedy Creek Improvement District.

<doc id="1174181" wikidata="Q2119279" url="?curid=1174181" title="The Ballad of Reading Gaol">
<text>The Ballad of Reading Gaol is a poem by Oscar Wilde, written in exile in Berneval-le-Grand and Naples, after his release from Reading Gaol () on 19 May 1897. Wilde had been incarcerated in Reading after being convicted of gross indecency with other men in 1895 and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour in prison.

During his imprisonment, on Tuesday, 7 July 1896, a hanging took place. Charles Thomas Wooldridge had been a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards. He was convicted of cutting the throat of his wife, Laura Ellen, earlier that year at Clewer, near Windsor. He was aged 30 when executed.

Wilde wrote the poem in 1897, beginning it in Berneval-le-Grand and completing it in Naples. The poem narrates the execution of Wooldridge; it moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners as a whole. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them, but rather the poem highlights the brutalisation of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line &quot;Yet each man kills the thing he loves&quot;. Wilde too was separated from his wife and sons. He adopted the proletarian ballad form, and suggested it be published in &quot;Reynold&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;because it circulates widely among the criminal classes – to which I now belong – for once I will be read by my peers – a new experience for me&quot;.

The finished poem was published by Leonard Smithers on 13 February 1898 under the name &quot;C.3.3.&quot;, which stood for cell block C, landing 3, cell 3. This ensured that Wilde&#x27;s name – by then notorious – did not appear on the poem&#x27;s front cover. It was not commonly known, until the 7th printing in June 1899, that C.3.3. was actually Wilde. The first edition, of 800 copies, sold out within a week, and Smithers announced that a second edition would be ready within another week; that was printed on 24 February, in 1,000 copies, which also sold well. A third edition, of 99 numbered copies &quot;signed by the author&quot;, was printed on 4 March, on the same day a fourth edition of 1,200 ordinary copies was printed. A fifth edition of 1,000 copies was printed on 17 March, and a sixth edition was printed in 1,000 copies on 21 May 1898. So far the book&#x27;s title page had identified the author only as C.3.3., although many reviewers, and of course those who bought the numbered and autographed third edition copies, knew that Wilde was the author, but the seventh edition, printed on 23 June 1899, actually revealed the author&#x27;s identity, putting the name Oscar Wilde, in square brackets, below the C.3.3. The poem brought him a small income for the rest of his life.

The poem consists of 109 sestets or six-line stanzas, a variation of the traditional ballad quatrain. The lines are formed of iambic tetrameters and trimeters of 8-6-8-6-8-6 syllables. The rhyme scheme is: ABCBDB. Some stanzas incorporate rhymes within some or all of the 8-syllable lines. The whole poem is grouped into 6 untitled sections of 16, 13, 37, 23, 17 and 3 stanzas. A version with only 63 of the stanzas, divided into 4 sections of 15, 7, 22 and 19 stanzas, and allegedly based on the original draft, was included in the posthumous editions of Wilde&#x27;s poetry edited by Robert Ross, &quot;for the benefit of reciters and their audiences who have found the entire poem too long for declamation&quot;.

==History of the poem==

On 25 May 1895 Wilde was convicted and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour—a punishment that was considered more severe than mere penal servitude. He was first sent, briefly, to Newgate Prison for initial processing, and the next week was moved to Pentonville prison, where &quot;hard labour&quot; consisted of many hours of pointless effort in walking a treadmill or picking oakum (separating the fibres in scraps of old navy ropes), and allowed to read only the Bible and &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, and, out of their solitary cells, were required to wear a cap with a sort of thick veil so they would not be recognised by other prisoners. A few months later he was moved to Wandsworth Prison, which had a similar regimen. While he was there, he was required to declare bankruptcy, by which he lost virtually all his possessions including his books and manuscripts. On 23 November 1895 he was again moved, to the prison at Reading, which also had similar rules, where he spent the remainder of his sentence, and was assigned the third cell on the third floor of C ward—and thereafter addressed and identified only as &quot;C.3.3.&quot;—prisoners were identified only by their cell numbers and not by name.

About five months after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol, Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his common-law wife (and promptly presenting himself and confessing to a policeman) on 29 March 1896. On 17 June, Wooldridge was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896—the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. Though Wilde observed Wooldridge in the prison yard only from a distance, he dedicated &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; to Wooldridge as &quot;C. T. W.&quot;

Wilde was released from prison on 18 May 1897, and promptly went to France, never returning to Britain. He died in Paris, at the age of 46, on 30 November 1900.

While in France, surviving on an allowance from his wife of three pounds a week—deliberately meagre to discourage the sort of high living that had led to his &#x27;downfall&#x27;—Wilde endeavoured to find additional money. In August 1897, he sent the publisher Leonard Smithers an initial draft of the Ballad, which made such an impression that Smithers was enthusiastic about publishing it and even approached Aubrey Beardsley to do an illustration for it (which was not done). Thereafter there was a very active correspondence between the two of them, as Wilde was repeatedly revising and expanding the text, and supervising from afar the choice and size of typeface and the layout of the work. However, even the printing house hired to do the book demanded a change—for fear that the prison doctor would sue over the line which originally read &quot;While the coarse-mouthed doctor gloats&quot;, it was changed to &quot;While some coarse-mouthed doctor gloats&quot;. As one biographer, Leonard Cresswell Ingleby, said, &quot;Never, perhaps, since Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot; had a poem been so revised, pruned, and polished over and over again as this cry from a prison cell&quot;. Originally the first edition—with no assurance of a second edition—was planned for only 400 copies, but when Wilde calculated the printing expenses, he realised that even selling all 400 would not cover costs, and at his instigation Smithers instructed the printing house to double the number of copies and keep the printing plates in hopes of a reprinting. As publication day approached, Wilde was occasionally seized by a sort of panic over his finances and the risks of the poem failing to sell well, and made some half-hearted efforts to sell the poem&#x27;s copyright for immediate cash; there were only a few disappointing nibbles and no such sale was made. However, the poem sold very well and very quickly, and caused such a stir that subsequent printings also sold well for more than a year, assuring Wilde of a steady income which he did not outlive, as he died less than three years after the Ballad first appeared.

It has been suggested that Wilde was, to some degree, inspired by poem IX in A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1896), which alludes to the hanging of condemned prisoners:

&lt;poem&gt;They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:
 The whistles blow forlorn,
And trains all night groan on the rail
 To men that die at dawn.&lt;/poem&gt;

Although there is no specific documentation to show Wilde&#x27;s active revising after the appearance of the first edition, there were some slight changes made in the second edition, which was printed only two weeks after the first edition went on sale. For example, in the first edition a line read &quot;And his step was light&quot;, and in the second edition it becomes &quot;And his step seemed light&quot;. These tiny alterations persisted through the seventh edition, the last edition handled by Smithers, and thereafter to most of the reprints. Since Smithers had the printers retain the plates from the first edition, it seems plausible that these were deliberate revisions done at Wilde&#x27;s request.

Wilde did acknowledge (evidently to several people, since numerous separate sources recalled this) a glaring error in the very first line of the poem, &quot;He did not wear his scarlet coat&quot;—because Wooldridge, as a member of the Royal Horse Guards, had a blue uniform—but justified this poetic licence because the second line would make no sense if it said &quot;For blood and wine are &quot;blue&quot;&quot;.

The poem has been translated into countless languages, including French (1898) by Henry Durand-Davray, Spanish (1898), German (1900), Russian (1904), and many others. The 1902 German translation by Emma Clausen is the earliest translation of the poem in any language done by a woman writer.

==Notable excerpts==
Several passages from the poem have become famous:

&lt;poem&gt;Yet each man kills the thing he loves
 By each let this be heard.
Some do it with a bitter look,
 Some with a flattering word.
The coward does it with a kiss,
 The brave man with a sword!&lt;/poem&gt;

The line is a nod to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, when Bassanio asks &quot;Do all men kill the things they do not love?&quot;

A passage from the poem was chosen as the epitaph on Wilde&#x27;s tomb;

&lt;poem&gt;And alien tears will fill for him,
 Pity&#x27;s long-broken urn,
For his mourners will be outcast men,
 And outcasts always mourn.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1174187" wikidata="Q4932260" url="?curid=1174187" title="Bob Delaney (politician)">
<text>Bob Delaney (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Mississauga West and Mississauga—Streetsville.

==Background==
Delaney was born in Montreal, Quebec, and has a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Concordia University in that city. He received a Master of Arts degree in business administration from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia in 1988, and has received accreditation from the Canadian Public Relations Society. He has lived primarily in Mississauga since 1983.

==Politics==
Delaney ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999 losing to Progressive Conservative cabinet minister John Snobelen by about 9,000 votes in the riding of Mississauga West. After Snobelen resigned from the legislature in early 2003 Delaney ran for the Liberals again in the provincial election of 2003, this time defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Nina Tangri by over 7,000 votes. He was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2014.

In 2006, Delaney was appointed the parliamentary assistant (PA) to the Minister Responsible for Seniors. He has subsequently served as PA to the Minister of Research and Innovation, the Minister of Tourism, the Minister of Revenue, the Minister of Education and the Minister of Energy. He also served as chair of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs from 2011 to 2013.

On March 25, 2014, he was named Chief Government Whip.

In May 2016, Delaney issued a statement apologizing to a mother who had informed his constituency staff that she was planning to distribute pamphlets at his office protesting changes in the autism program that would affect her son and was subsequently visited by officers of the Peel Regional Police who told her that she could not touch the office door while protesting.

In March 2018, Delaney responded to a question by &quot;The Mississauga News&quot; by boasting that his Liberal government had increased the provincial debt: &quot;We have tripled the debt and we&#x27;re proud of it, because we can afford it. It&#x27;s the responsible thing to do. It&#x27;s the correct thing to do, it&#x27;s what people have asked us to do and I would do it again and do it proudly&quot;. Delaney initially denied having made the statement in an e-mail to Global News Radio AM 640. However, he subsequently admitted to it and apologized.

<doc id="1174188" wikidata="Q115172" url="?curid=1174188" title="Daniel Lewis Williams">
<text>Daniel Lewis Williams (March 29, 1943 – January 10, 2023) was an American operatic basso profundo.

Williams was born in Ogden, Utah, but grew up in Billings, Montana, and appeared in operas and concerts as a boy soprano in the western United States. After his voice changed, he appeared frequently in musicals and won the International Kiwanis Talent Contest in New York City at 17 for his performance of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; from &quot;Show Boat&quot;. He graduated with a B.A. in theater from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. He continued his studies at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik in Munich, Germany, studying with Ernst Haefliger, Kurt Böhme, and Kurt Moll.

Williams began his professional career with the Trier, Germany opera, with regular engagements with the Landestheater in Kiel and the theater in Krefeld. In 1989, he became the regular bass at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf.

Williams had a far-flung international career, appearing in many of the major opera houses of Europe and the United States, as well as in Japan. His signature roles are Baron Ochs von Lerchenau in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (a role that he has performed in over 22 productions all over the world), Sarastro in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, and King Philip in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, but he sang many roles that are rarely attempted by other basses because of his tremendous range. He has recently added Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; to his repertoire, and in June 2005, he sang in a production of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Daphne&quot; in La Fenice theater in Venice, Italy with June Anderson.

Williams appeared on a DVD of &quot;Rosenkavalier&quot; recorded live at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo which is in general distribution. He also recorded a CD with his daughter Judith Williams, a presenter on the German shopping channel, called &quot;Träume&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Williams was married to the former Gaye Hicks, and they had three daughters, the oldest of whom is Judith Williams, a presenter on German television and owner of a cosmetics company. They lived near Trier, Germany, for many years, and then moved to Bavaria.

Williams died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on January 10, 2023, at the age of 79.

<doc id="1174200" wikidata="Q4978139" url="?curid=1174200" title="Bruce Petty">
<text>Bruce Leslie Petty (23 November 1929 – 6 April 2023) was an Australian political satirist, sculptor and cartoonist. He was a regular contributor to Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper.

Petty was born on 23 November 1929, at Doncaster, a suburb of Melbourne. 

His intricate images have been described as &quot;doodle-bombs&quot; for their free-association of links between various ideas, people and institutions. &quot;Age&quot; journalist Martin Flanagan wrote that Petty &quot;re-invented the world as a vast scribbly machine with interlocking cogs and levers that connected people in wholly logical but unlikely ways.&quot;

==Work==
Petty began working for the Owen Brothers animation studio in Melbourne in 1949, before moving to the UK in 1954. His cartoons were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Punch&quot;. On his return to Australia in 1961, he worked at first for &quot;The (Sydney) Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and &quot;The Australian&quot; before joining &quot;The Age&quot; in 1976.

In 1976, the animated film &quot;Leisure&quot;, of which he was the director, won an Academy Award for the producer Suzanne Baker (the first Australian woman to win an Oscar). &quot;When I got it, the Oscar went to the producer. We got a picture of it, a very nice gold-framed picture.&quot; (&quot;The Age&quot;, 22 June 2004)

Petty made a number of other award-winning animated films including &quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Australian History&quot;, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; and &quot;Karl Marx&quot;.

Petty also created a number of &quot;machine sculptures&quot; with the most famous being a piece known as &quot;Man Environment Machine&quot; (fondly known as the &quot;Petty Machine&quot;) that was a feature piece of the Australian Pavilion at World Expo &#x27;85 at Tsukuba, Japan.

In 2001 Patty was awarded a Silver Stanley Award by the Australian Cartoonists&#x27; Association.

In 2007, he received the AFI Best Documentary Director prize for the documentary &quot;Global Haywire&quot; which he wrote, directed and animated, as well as the Best Documentary Sound prize ; this documentary tries to unravel the global pattern that leads to an understanding of how the world came to be as it is today, and is based on interviews with intellectuals, students and journalists.

In 2009 Petty was awarded the Melbourne Press Club&#x27;s Quill Lifetime Achievement Award.

Petty&#x27;s 2008 book, &quot;Petty&#x27;s Parallel Worlds&quot;, is a retrospective collection of editorial cartoons from 1959 to the present, street sketches done on assignment around the world, and etchings.

Those of Petty&#x27;s cartoons that depict themes such as the economy, international relations or other social issues as complicated interlocking machines (that manipulate, or are manipulated by, people) have been likened to Rube Goldberg machines or Heath Robinson contraptions.

At the 2016 Walkley Awards Petty was recognised with the Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism award.

===Influences===
Petty said in the foreword to &quot;Parallel Worlds&quot; that he was a humanist and socialist, mentioning visits to Nicaragua and Cuba in the early 1960s, and feeling the influence of Colin Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Outsider&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Petty was married firstly to ABC journalist and film critic Julie Rigg. They had two sons. In 1988 he married award-winning author Kate Grenville, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He and Grenville separated, and Petty then partnered with the bookseller Lesley McKay.

Petty died on 6 April 2023, at the age of 93.

<text>The Hare&#x27;s Ear or Gold Ribbed Hare’s Ear is a traditional artificial fly imitating an aquatic insect larva (nymph) used in fly fishing.

==Description==
The Hare&#x27;s Ear nymph fly is fished below the surface thus a &quot;wet fly&quot; or &quot;nymph&quot;. It is an older pattern that imitates a variety of aquatic life, including scuds, sow bugs, mayfly nymphs, and caddis larvae.

==Tying==
Soft hair and stiff bristles from a hare are wound around the shank of the hook and fastened with gold wire that suggests segmentation. Sometimes a gold bead head is added for weight and stability in the water and a strand of pheasant feather is added for a tail. The bead head can be fastened near the eye of the hook. This pattern is commonly tied on size 10 - 16 nymph hooks. Traditional colouring is a brown body with orange or brown thread.

==Tactics==
When this fly is immersed, the stiff fibers in the dubbing stand out and imitate the legs of an insect. Fish this lure below the surface with or without a small strike indicator and split-shot to help it sink. It is an effective pattern throughout the year because it covers a broad spectrum of prey that are active in every season.

<text>Ofra Harnoy (; born January 31, 1965) is an Israeli-Canadian cellist. She is a Member of the Order of Canada. By joining the international artists roster of RCA Victor Red Seal, Harnoy became the first Canadian classical instrumental soloist since Glenn Gould to gain an exclusive worldwide contract with a major record label. She is a five-time Juno Award winner.

==Life==
Harnoy was born in Hadera, Israel. She moved with her family to Toronto in 1971. When she was six, she began cello lessons with her father, Jacob Harnoy. Her teachers included Vladimir Orloff, William Pleeth, Pierre Fournier, Jacqueline du Pré, and Mstislav Rostropovich.

Harnoy made her professional debut as a soloist with an orchestra at age 10. Her solo-orchestral and recital debuts at Carnegie Hall in 1982 brought her public and critical acclaim.

Harnoy performed and recorded the world premiere of the Offenbach cello concerto in 1985 and the North American premiere of the Bliss cello concerto in 1984. She also made the world premiere recordings of several Vivaldi concertos. In 1987, she joined the roster of RCA Victor Red Seal and recorded several best selling albums.

Harnoy has played in many genres of music. She has played with artists such as Plácido Domingo, Sting, Igor Oistrakh, Loreena McKennitt, and Jesse Cook.

In 2019, Harnoy released &quot;Back to Bach&quot;, on the Canadian classical label Analekta.

In September 2023 released her latest album,&quot;Elgar &amp; Lalo cello concertos&quot; on Sony classical.

She is married to the trumpeter, producer, and composer Mike Herriott.

<doc id="1174210" wikidata="Q3421556" url="?curid=1174210" title="Ready 2 Rumble Boxing">
<text>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is a boxing video game developed by Midway Studios San Diego, and published by Midway in September 1999 for the Dreamcast. Ports for Nintendo 64 and PlayStation were developed by Point of View and released in November 1999 alongside a separate version for Game Boy Color by Crawfish Interactive. The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.

==Gameplay==
Like Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; series, &quot;Ready 2 Rumble Boxing&quot; features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris &quot;The Bear&quot; Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; series, the game is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over one&#x27;s character in the ring. Also unlike &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, players can choose whichever boxer they want from a rather large selection of characters.

Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one or two letters at a time, until the word &quot;RUMBLE&quot; is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows; most such actions will yield one letter, though some particularly strong punches may yield more. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special combo called &quot;Rumble Flurry&quot;, activated by pressing a button combination. Each character&#x27;s &quot;flurry&quot; is unique to them, and consists of a series of punches which does a large amount of damage if landed successfully.

One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK&#x27;s 1992 game &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supplied to the game.

The Game Boy Color version was one of the few games for the system to feature built-in rumble.

The Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 versions each have an exclusive boxer: these are, respectively, Jimmy Blood, Gino Stiletto, and J.R. Flurry.

Ring announcer Michael Buffer appears in the game as himself.
==Development==
The game was showcased at E3 1999.

==Marketing==

Ready 2 Rumble Boxing commercials were produced by MTV. The commercials mimicked that of the &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; film where animated characters fraternize with humans.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews on all platforms except the Game Boy Color version, which received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Chris Charla of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the Dreamcast original in its November 1999 issue, &quot;With fast action, seriously funny character design, and excellent graphics, Midway once again proves it&#x27;s untouchable when it comes to arcade sports.&quot; Two issues later, however, Adam Pavlacka said of the Nintendo 64 version, &quot;After playing the Dreamcast version for months, it is hard for us to accept an inferior version of the game, even if it does play just as well.&quot; In Japan, where the Dreamcast version was ported and published by Sega under the name on January 13, 2000, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 28 out of 40.

Dan Elektro of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the Dreamcast original in one review, &quot;With its unique look, awesome two-player matchups, and high replay value, &quot;Ready 2 Rumble Boxing&quot; makes the hungry young Dreamcast look like a true contender.&quot; In another review, Scary Larry said that the same Dreamcast version was &quot;far and away better than [&quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; and &quot;Super Punch-Out!!&quot;], and one of the most fun boxing games you&#x27;ll ever find. The only flaw you may find is that the game is easy to beat, and once you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;re done. Want realism? Buy &quot;Knockout Kings&quot;. Want something fun and playable? &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; is the king of the ring.&quot; Boba Fatt said of the Nintendo 64 version in one review, &quot;It may not be as pretty as its Dreamcast version, but &quot;R2RB&quot; still rocks the N64 with a one-two audio/visual combination, finishing the job with an outstanding right hook for personality.&quot; However, iBot said in another review that the same N64 version was &quot;is inferior to the Dreamcast version, maybe more so than it should be. But what&#x27;s most important is that the raucous gameplay is still there . If you don&#x27;t have a Dreamcast and don&#x27;t plan on getting one (shame on you), then definitely jump into the ring with this game. Otherwise you&#x27;ll be missing out on a brawlin&#x27; good time.&quot; Major Mike&#x27;s review of the PlayStation version called it &quot;a pick-up-and-play boxing game that&#x27;s short on learning, long on fun – and it all occurs without messy reality getting in the way.&quot; The D-Pad Destroyer said of the same console version in another review, &quot;On its own merits, &quot;Ready 2 Rumble&quot; takes the PSX places it&#x27;s never been. Unfortunately, the Dreamcast has been there, done that, and burned the bridges behind it. If you&#x27;ve never played the DC version, and you don&#x27;t think you ever will, this version is really not bad at all. It&#x27;s just a PlayStation version of a very impressive Dreamcast title, and the PlayStation just isn&#x27;t quite up to snuff.&quot;

Mark Green of &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; gave the Nintendo 64 version 81%, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for something to fill the gap between wrestling titles, &quot;&quot;Ready 2 Rumble&quot; is just about adequate. But with &quot;Knockout Kings 2000&quot; out there, and &quot;Smash Bros&quot; and &quot;Wrestlemania&quot; offering more accomplished knockabout fighting, it&#x27;s hard to get excited about the game. We&#x27;ll applaud Midway for creating a fighter with a sense of humour and a real &#x27;personality&#x27; – it&#x27;s just a shame the fighting itself isn&#x27;t as much fun.&quot;

The Dreamcast version was a nominee for &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot; at the AIAS&#x27; 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; it was ultimately given to &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. The game did win the &quot;9th Annual &quot;GamePro&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Awards&quot; for &quot;Best Boxing Game&quot;.

==Sequel==
The game was followed by a sequel in 2000 called &quot;Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2&quot;, and was later followed by a third game in the series, &quot;Ready 2 Rumble: Revolution&quot;, released on March 17, 2009.

Afro Thunder is featured in &quot;TNA iMPACT!&quot; upon gaining 750,000 style points and &quot;TNA iMPACT!: Cross The Line&quot; upon unlocking the Freedom Center arena.

<text>Air Warrior is a discontinued multiplayer online combat flight simulation game launched by Kesmai in 1987. It was hosted on GEnie and used that service as a server for client software running on a variety of personal computers. It underwent continual improvement through its decade-long lifetime with Kesmai, appearing on new platforms and host services. Electronic Arts purchased Air Warrior in 1999, and became provider of the game, but it was discontinued in 2001. Sequels &quot;Air Warrior II&quot; and &quot;Air Warrior III&quot; were both released in 1997 and published by Interactive Magic.

&quot;Air Warrior&quot; was one of the first massive online games, hosting hundreds of users during busy periods. It inspired &quot;WarBirds&quot;, which in turn inspired &quot;Aces High&quot;, while other members of the &quot;Warbirds&quot; team went on to produce &quot;World War II Online&quot;. Today there are a number of similar games, like &quot;WarThunder&quot;, most of them based on a freemium model.

==History==
Introduced in 1988 by Kesmai, &quot;Air Warrior&quot; was played over modems and hosted on the GEnie online service provider. Players could choose one of a number of World War II aircraft to fly, along with ground vehicles, and play in a multiplayer &quot;arena&quot; with hundreds of other players. The game focused mostly on dogfighting, with a secondary strategic role of capturing forward airbases near the center of the map. Several updated versions were released, and additional service providers were added over time.

The original version of &quot;Air Warrior&quot; ran on Apple Macintosh, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST computers, had simple black and white wireframe graphics, and cost over $10 per hour to play. Over time, Kesmai produced improved versions of the game, starting with SVGA &quot;Air Warrior&quot; in 1993, and continuing with &quot;Air Warrior&quot; for Windows in 1996, &quot;Air Warrior II&quot; in early 1997, &quot;Air Warrior III&quot; later in 1997, and finally &quot;Air Warrior III Millennium Version&quot; in 2000. Development of &quot;Air Warrior II&quot; was directly overseen by Bill Stealey, founder of the game&#x27;s publisher, Interactive Magic.

Kesmai also did business deals to provide access to &quot;Air Warrior&quot; through additional on-line services, including Delphi, CRIS, CompuServe, America Online, Earthlink, Gamestorm and CompuLink. A version of &quot;Air Warrior&quot; for Windows was ported back to the Macintosh in 1997 in an Internet open beta, and then later moved to America Online. In 1999, Electronic Arts purchased &quot;Air Warrior&quot;, and became provider of the latest version of the game, only to discontinue it in 2001.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1990 called &quot;Air Warrior&quot; &quot;the most exciting [wargame] I&#x27;ve played&quot;, warning players to &quot;be resigned to spending some money on it, though, because &quot;time&quot; flies while &quot;you&quot; do&quot;. 1991 and 1993 surveys in the magazine of strategy and war games gave it three and a half stars out of five. The magazine in 1993 praised the flight models&#x27; accuracy, stating that it forced pilots to choose correctly when selecting aircraft to fly against other humans. The magazine suggested that if Kesmai were to add some upgrades to the offline single-player mode it would &quot;blow away any of the competition&quot;. In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title four stars out of five, noting its high cost but reporting that it was &quot;continually being revised and updated&quot;.

In 1997 &quot;Next Generation&quot; named &quot;Air Warrior&quot; as number six on their &quot;Top 10 Online Game Picks&quot;. They noted that &quot;Air Warrior&quot; provided a multiplayer flight sim online with a persistent environment.

<text>Ernst Haefliger (6 July 191917 March 2007) was a Swiss tenor.
==Biography ==
Haefliger was born in Davos, Switzerland, on 6 July 1919 and studied at the Wettinger Seminary and the Zürich Conservatory. Later he became a pupil of Fernando Carpi in Geneva and the noted tenor Julius Patzak in Vienna. He devoted himself to lieder and choral works, and soon established a reputation for impeccable style and musicianship.

Haefliger sang the Evangelist in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot; for the first time in Zürich, in 1943. After this debut he was engaged for several concerts in Switzerland and – after World War II – abroad. He soon won the attention of Ferenc Fricsay, who engaged him for the Salzburg Festival where Haefliger&#x27;s world career started in 1949 with the role of Tiresias in Carl Orff&#x27;s opera &quot;Antigonae&quot;. He also sang the role of First Armed Man in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler the same year at the Salzburg Festival.

In 1952, he responded to the call of Ferenc Fricsay and joined him at the Deutsche Oper Berlin where he sang the tenor parts in all Mozart operas, in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and &quot;Le comte Ory&quot;, in Pfitzner&#x27;s &quot;Palestrina&quot;, the role of Hans in Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, among others.

Haefliger had a lengthy and extensive international career. He made his Boston debut in 1965 for the Peabody Mason Concert series. Furthermore, he recorded many lieder, oratorios and operas for Angel, Columbia, Vanguard and Philips Records, whereas Deutsche Grammophon has issued a box set of twelve CD’s entitled &quot;The Art of Ernst Haefliger,&quot; with repertoire ranging from J.S. Bach to Janácek and including the three great Schubert lieder cycles. 

From 1971 to 1988, he taught at the Hochschule für Musik in Munich, Germany. 

Haefliger also gave master classes in Zürich, Japan and the United States, and wrote &quot;Die Singstimme&quot; (Bern 1983).

== Personal life ==
Haefliger died from acute decompensated heart failure on 17 March 2007, in Davos, aged 88. The pianist, Andreas Haefliger, is his son.

<doc id="1174230" wikidata="Q56316084" url="?curid=1174230" title="Congregation Emanu-El of New York">
<text>Congregation Emanu-El of New York is the first Reform Jewish congregation in New York City. It has served as a flagship congregation in the Reform branch of Judaism since its founding in 1845. The building it uses – (called &quot;Temple Emanu-El of New York&quot;) – was built in 1928–1930 and is one of the largest synagogue buildings in the world.

The congregation currently comprises about 2,500 families and has been led by Senior Rabbi Joshua M. Davidson since July 2013. The congregation is located at 1 East 65th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The Temple houses the Bernard Museum of Judaica, the congregation&#x27;s collection of more than 1,000 Jewish ceremonial art objects.

==History==
===1845–1926===

The congregation was founded by 33 mainly German Jews who assembled for services in April 1845 in a rented hall near Grand and Clinton Streets in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. The first services they held were highly traditional. The Temple (as it became known) moved several times as the congregation grew larger and wealthier.

In October 1847, the congregation moved to a former Methodist church at 56 Chrystie Street. The congregation commissioned architect Leopold Eidlitz to draw up plans for the renovation of the church into a synagogue. Radical departures from Orthodox religious practice were soon introduced to Temple Emanu-El, setting precedents that proclaimed the principles of &quot;classical&quot; Reform Judaism in America. In 1848, the German vernacular spoken by the congregants replaced the traditional liturgical language of Hebrew in prayer books. Instrumental music, formerly banished from synagogues, was first played during services in 1849 when an organ was installed. In 1853, the tradition of calling congregants for aliyot was abolished (but retained for bar mitzvah ceremonies), leaving the reading of the Torah exclusively to the presiding rabbi. By 1869 the Chrystie Street building became the home of Congregation Beth Israel Bikur Cholim.

Further changes were made in 1854 when Temple Emanu-El moved to 12th Street. Most controversially, mixed seating was adopted, allowing families to sit together, instead of segregating the sexes on opposite sides of a mechitza. After much heated debate, the congregation also resolved to observe Rosh Hashanah for only one day rather than the customary two.

In 1857, after the death of founding Rabbi Leo Merzbacher, German speakers still formed a majority of the congregation and appointed another German Jew, Samuel Adler, to be his successor.

In 1868, Emanu-El erected a new building for the first time, a Moorish Revival structure by Leopold Eidlitz, assisted by Henry Fernbach at 43rd Street and 5th Avenue after raising about $650,000.

The congregation hired its first English-speaking rabbi, Gustav Gottheil, in 1873, from Manchester, England.

In 1888, Joseph Silverman became the first American-born rabbi to officiate at the Temple. He was a member of the second class to graduate from Hebrew Union College.

The 1870s and 1880s witnessed further departures from traditional ritual. Men could now pray without wearing kippot to cover their heads. Bar mitzvah ceremonies were no longer held. The &quot;Union Prayer Book&quot; was adopted in 1895.

Felix Adler, the founder of the Ethical Culture movement, came to New York as a child when his father, Samuel L. Adler, took over as the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El, an appointment that placed him among the most influential figures in Reform Judaism.

In 1924, Lazare Saminsky became music director of the Temple, and made it a center of Jewish music. He also composed and commissioned music for the Temple services.

===1926–present===

In January 1926, the 1868 synagogue building was sold for $6,500,000 to the developer Benjamin Winter Sr., who sold it to Joseph Durst in December 1926 for $7,000,000. In 1927, Durst demolished the building to make room for commercial development.

Emanu-El merged with New York&#x27;s Temple Beth-El on April 11, 1927; they are considered co-equal parents of the current Emanu-El. The new synagogue was built in 1928 to 1930.

By the 1930s, Emanu-El began to absorb large numbers of Jews whose families had arrived in poverty from Eastern Europe and brought with them their Yiddish language and devoutly Orthodox religious heritage. In contrast, Emanu-El was dominated by affluent German-speaking Jews whose liberal approaches to Judaism originated in Western Europe, where civic emancipation had enticed Jews to discard many of their ethnoreligious customs and embrace the lifestyles of their neighbors. For the descendants of Eastern European immigrants, joining Temple Emanu-El often signified their upward mobility and progress in assimilating into American society. However, the intake of these new congregants also helped to slow or halt, if not force, a limited retreat from, the &#x27;rejectionist&#x27; attitude which &quot;classical&quot; Reform had espoused towards traditional ritual.

From 1934 to 1947, Dr. Samuel H. Goldenson (1878–1962) was the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El. He was president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis from 1933 to 1935.

In 1973, David M. Posner joined the rabbinical staff. Known for his active involvement in the community, he served as the congregation&#x27;s Senior Emeritus rabbi after his retirement.

<text>Dame Enid Muriel Lyons (; 9 July 1897 – 2 September 1981) was an Australian politician. She was notable as the being the first woman to be elected to the House of Representatives and to serve in the federal cabinet. Prior to her own political career, she was best known as the wife of Joseph Lyons, Prime Minister of Australia from 1932 to 1939, who served previously as Premier of Tasmania from 1923 to 1928.

Lyons was born in Smithton, Tasmania. She grew up in various small towns in northern Tasmania, and trained as a schoolteacher. At the age of 17, she married politician Joseph Lyons, who was almost 18 years her senior. They would have twelve children together, all but one of whom lived to adulthood. As her husband&#x27;s career progressed, Lyons began assisting him in campaigning and developed a reputation as a talented public speaker. In 1925, she became one of the first two women to stand for the Labor Party at a Tasmanian state election. She followed her husband into the new United Australia Party (UAP) following the Labor split of 1931.

After her husband became prime minister in 1932, Lyons began living at The Lodge in Canberra. She was one of the best-known prime minister&#x27;s wives, writing newspaper articles, making radio broadcasts, and giving open-air speeches. Her husband&#x27;s sudden death in office in 1939 came as a great shock, and she withdrew from public life for a time. At the 1943 federal election, Lyons successfully stood for the UAP in the Division of Darwin. She and Senator (Dame) Dorothy Tangney became the first two women elected to federal parliament. Lyons joined the new Liberal Party in 1945, and served as Vice-President of the Executive Council in the Menzies Government from 1949 to 1951 – the first woman in cabinet. She retired from parliament after three terms, but remained involved in public life as a board member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (1951–1962) and as a social commentator.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Lyons was born on 8 July 1897 at Leesville, a small sawmilling settlement outside Smithton, Tasmania. Her birth was registered just over one month later. She was the second of four children born to Eliza (née Taggett) and William Burnell. Her father, a sawyer and talented musician, was born in Devon, England, and grew up in Cardiff, Wales, before immigrating to Australia at the age of 17. Her mother was born in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia, to an English immigrant father who had drawn by the Victorian gold rush. Her forebears in England had been middle-class, but the family fell into relative poverty in Australia. Lyons&#x27; parents first met at Angellala on Queensland&#x27;s western railway line, where her widowed maternal grandmother Louisa Taggett (née Orchard) had won a catering contract. They married in Brisbane in 1888 and initially settled in Burringbar, New South Wales, where their first child was born. They moved to northern Tasmania in 1894 to be closer to William&#x27;s parents, who farmed in Somerset.

Lyons&#x27; biographer Anne Henderson has speculated that William Burnell may not have been her biological father, and that she may instead have been fathered by Aloysius Joyce Jr., the son of a prominent local businessman. However, she also notes that &quot;nothing [William] did in rearing her would suggest she was not his own&quot;. According to an account from the Joyce family, William confronted Aloysius Joyce Sr. and the two were overheard arguing, with Joyce eventually accepting Enid as a blood relation and agreeing to provide financial support to the Burnells if William raised her as his own daughter. Henderson suggests this as an explanation as to how the family were later able to secure a loan to buy property with limited income and no collateral.

===Childhood===

In 1901, Lyons and her family moved to Stowport, Tasmania, a rural locality south of Burnie. She began her education at a one-room public school, at a distance of from her home. Her mother supplemented the family&#x27;s income by mending and laundering clothes and delivering meals to itinerant workers, taking a particular interest in well-educated visitors and those from overseas. She intended that her daughters would enter the teaching profession, which at the time provided the only opportunity for girls to gain a state-funded secondary education. In 1904, the family moved to a property at Cooee, on the coast to Burnie&#x27;s west. They operated a small general store from their residence, with her mother serving as the local postmistress, and later added a dancehall which was rented out for community events. Lyons and her siblings attended school in Burnie.

==Marriage==

Eliza Burnell introduced her 15-year-old daughter to Joseph Lyons, a rising Tasmanian Labor politician. On 28 April 1915, the two married at Wynyard, Tasmania; she was 17 and Lyons was 35. Enid had been brought up a Methodist but became, at Lyons&#x27; request, a Roman Catholic. They would have twelve children, one of whom died in infancy.

==State politics==
Lyons&#x27; husband, an MP since 1909, was elected state leader of the ALP in the aftermath of the 1916 party split over conscription. She was an active member of the ALP in her own right, appearing as a women&#x27;s branch delegate at the 1918 state conference where she successfully amended one motion and co-sponsored a motion for compulsory military training with Edmund Dwyer-Gray. Her position as wife of the opposition leader gave her greater public prominence and beginning at the 1922 state election she began making appearances on his behalf. In October 1923, Lyons&#x27; husband was unexpected appointed premier of Tasmania following the collapse of the incumbent Nationalist government. She was expected to undertake various social engagements on his behalf, although she had to meet her own expenses and usually had to rely on public transport.

In 1924, Lyons gave birth to her seventh child, the first born to an incumbent Tasmanian premier. The family experienced a number of difficulties over the following two years. She was bedridden with mumps for two months in mid-1925, shortly after which her infant son died of meningitis. A few months later she miscarried and was forced to carry the dead foetus for three months; the curettage procedure resulted in toxemia. In July 1926, her husband was severely injured in a car accident that caused the death of his colleague Michael O&#x27;Keefe, remaining in hospital for nine weeks.

===1925 candidacy===

In 1925, Lyons and her mother became the first women to stand as ALP candidates in Tasmania. The 1925 state election was only the second since Tasmanian women received the right to stand for state parliament in 1921. Lyons stood in the Hobart-based seat of Denison, where it was hoped she would draw votes away from female voters supporting independent candidate Edith Waterworth, while her mother stood in the seat of Darwin which included her home town of Burnie.

Lyons, aged 27, emerged as a &quot;natural local candidate&quot;, making frequent public speeches both in support of her own candidacy and supporting her husband as he toured other electorates. She opened her campaign at the Hobart Town Hall, standing on a platform that included increased government funding of education and health, clearance of Hobart&#x27;s slums, and government control of milk distribution and the saw-milling industry. She appealed primarily to female voters and frequently used domestic metaphors in her speeches, while also attacking the Nationalist opposition for financial mismanagement. The ALP ultimately won its first majority government in Tasmania, with Lyons finishing around 60 votes short of election in Denison.

==Federal politics==

In 1931 Joseph Lyons left the Labor Party and joined the United Australia Party (UAP), becoming prime minister at the subsequent election. Enid Lyons was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the Coronation Honours of 1937. Joseph Lyons died in April 1939, aged 59, the first Australian prime minister to die in office, and Dame Enid returned to Tasmania. She bitterly resented Joseph Lyons&#x27; successor as leader of the UAP, Robert Menzies, who had, she believed, betrayed her husband by resigning from the cabinet shortly before Joseph&#x27;s death.

===Widowhood===
Lyons suffered from &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot; in the period immediately after her husband&#x27;s death. She fainted or collapsed on a number of occasions and spent several weeks in hospital, initially at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney, and later at Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne. She had some requests to stand for his seat at the resulting by-election, including from Jessie Street, but declined. Outside of the family home, Lyons was left only £344 () from her husband&#x27;s estate. In the absence of any parliamentary pension, the government under caretaker prime minister Earle Page immediately drafted legislation to provide annuities for her and the couple&#x27;s seven dependent children. There was some opposition from Joseph&#x27;s political opponents who regarded the amount as excessive, and she was eventually awarded an annual grant of £500 () with another £500 for the children&#x27;s education through to the age of 16. Lyons received thousands of letters of condolence, which she answered with the help of family and her husband&#x27;s former staff, but also received hate mail over the annuities issue – &quot;filthy epithets, threats, dead rats, things even more revolting&quot; – leading her to stop opening her own mail.

In December 1939, Lyons began a series of weekly Sunday evening broadcasts for 7LA Launceston, which were syndicated on the Macquarie Broadcasting Network. She turned down other offers, including from the ABC and from Keith Murdoch&#x27;s 3DB. The Macquarie broadcasts came to an end in June 1940, partially due to a lack of sponsorship. In the same year she had moved to Melbourne to be closer to her children&#x27;s schools, leasing a house in Malvern East. Her mother died in January 1941, a few months after Lyons had become a grandmother for the first time at the age of 43. She had left Melbourne after only a brief period and returned to Devonport, staying out of public life for a few years.

==Member of Parliament (1943–1951)==
Lyons was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1943 federal election, joining Senator Dorothy Tangney as one of the first two women in federal parliament. Following the retirement of incumbent MP George Bell, she decided to nominate for UAP preselection in her home electorate of Darwin. She faced two male competitors, conservative farmer John Wright and businessman John Leary, with the nomination committee eventually deciding to endorse three candidates in the seat with the hopes of appealing to different demographics. Lyons campaigned in remote areas and also made frequent use of radio broadcasts, specialising in late-night talks she described as &quot;bed-time stories&quot;. Despite a large nationwide swing against the UAP, she ultimately defeated the ALP candidate, future premier Eric Reece, with 51 percent of the two-party preferred vote. The result took several weeks to finalise and she conceded defeat at one point, but emerged a clear winner when late votes from soldiers overseas were included.

Lyons gave her maiden speech to the House of Representatives on 29 September 1943, later repeating her speech for radio broadcast as it was several years before the advent of live parliamentary broadcasts. She began the speech by making reference to the historic nature of the occasion and her status as an outsider. She concentrated on policy matters, advocating for social welfare schemes, child endowment, and the need for post-war training schemes for those involved in the war effort. Lyons&#x27; second and third speeches in March 1944 were &quot;judged as an attempt on her part to depart from her preoccupation with women&#x27;s issues&quot;. She accused striking coal miners of disloyalty and placing their own interests above those of the nation during World War II, and opposed the Curtin government&#x27;s 1944 referendum proposal to increase government powers.

In August 1944, Lyons was one of four speakers in a debate on population which became the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#x27;s &quot;largest controversy during the war years&quot;. Lyons devoted a chapter to this debate in her 1972 autobiography, calling it &quot;one of the most disturbing experiences I was to know as a member of parliament&quot;. Her fellow debaters were Norman Haire, Jessie Street and the economist Colin Clark. Later in 1944, Lyons and Phyllis Cilento presented a report to the National Health and Medical Research Council arguing for the government to support an increase in the national birth rate.

Lyons had a sometimes uneasy relationship with UAP leader Robert Menzies, disliking his domineering personality and what she perceived as past disloyalty to her husband. She voted against Menzies in the 1943 UAP leadership ballot and allied herself with his rivals Billy Hughes, Archie Cameron and Percy Spender. She was also close to Country Party MPs Earle Page, Arthur Fadden and Larry Anthony. She joined the new Liberal Party of Australia upon its formation in 1945 and was elected to the federal policy committee, where she credited herself with gaining support for free medical treatment for pensioners and child endowment as official party policies. Lyons was initially ambivalent about re-contesting her seat at the 1946 election. She was re-elected with an increased majority, although her friend and colleague Allan Guy was defeated in the neighbouring seat of Wilmot. In her second term she became more combative in parliament, clashing with minister Arthur Calwell on several occasions and coming close to suspension in October 1947, following a conflict with ALP chairman of committees Joe Clark.

===Cabinet and retirement===
Lyons had thyroid-related health issues in the lead-up to the 1949 federal election. During the campaign she underwent an urgent operation to remove two large goitres from her neck. She spent four weeks in hospital recovering, during which time her father died. She made only a last-minute appearance at a rally to condemn an opponent who had accused her of seeking a &quot;sympathy vote&quot;.

Lyons again increased her majority at the election and was widely expected to be appointed to the ministry in the new government, with newspapers speculating she would be offered the immigration or social services portfolios. She was ultimately appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, a largely honorary position that she described as &quot;toothless&quot;, observing that &quot;they only wanted me to pour the tea&quot;. Lyons was disappointed not to be offered a substantive ministerial portfolio and believed that Menzies &quot;did not want her in the ministry but seemed to have been pressured into giving her some sort of spot&quot;. She did however acknowledge that her poor health would have limited her ministerial capabilities and that there was intense competition for cabinet positions following the Coalition&#x27;s landslide victory.

Lyons was sworn in to office with the fourth Menzies Ministry on 19 December 1949, the first woman to serve in cabinet. She continued to have poor health, requiring another surgery in 1950 for an ulcer on her nose that developed into skin cancer, and also experiencing side-effects from her thyroid medication. Her contribution to cabinet discussions was limited, although she successfully lobbied for a woman to be appointed to the organising committee for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. She was &quot;disturbed&quot; by cabinet&#x27;s decision to commit Australian troops to the Korean War. Lyons resigned from cabinet for health reasons on 7 March 1951. Menzies called a double dissolution shortly thereafter and she declined to re-contest her seat at the 1951 election, bringing an end to her parliamentary career.

==Later life and legacy==
In retirement, Dame Enid&#x27;s health recovered. She was a newspaper columnist (1951–54), a commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1951–62), and remained active in public life promoting family and women&#x27;s issues. She published three volumes of memoirs, which embarrassed the Liberal Party by reviving her complaints about Menzies&#x27; 1939 behaviour towards her husband.

Lyons was made a Dame of the Order of Australia (AD) on Australia Day 1980, the second woman to receive this honour after Alexandra Hasluck. She was the first Australian woman to receive damehoods in different orders. Lyons died at Ulverstone on 2 September 1981, aged 84. She was accorded a state funeral in Devonport before being buried next to her husband at Mersey Vale Memorial Park.

==Legacy==
Jo Gullett in his autobiography discussed his fellow members of parliament and concluded that, &quot;with hindsight, perhaps the wisest and most far-sighted of them all was a woman, Dame Enid Lyons.&quot;

An informal political faction of the Liberal/National opposition parties called the Lyons Forum was formed in 1992. The group&#x27;s name alluded to Lyons&#x27; maiden speech to the House of Representatives. The faction was considered to be defunct in 2004.

In 1943 to commemorate Lyons&#x27; entering of parliament, artist Justine Kong Sing painted a miniature portrait of Lyons that is held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia.

In March 2023, a dual bronze sculpture of Lyons and Dame Dorothy Tangney was placed in the gardens of Old Parliament House, Canberra. The statues, sculpted by Lis Johnson, were inspired by an iconic photograph of the pair entering the building on their first day of parliament in September 1943. Lyons&#x27; granddaughter, former Director of the Australian Workplace Gender Equality Agency Libby Lyons, described the unveiling as a &quot;wonderful, thrilling moment&quot;.

==Children==
Lyons first fell pregnant a few months after her marriage, but miscarried just after her 18th birthday. She suffered a second miscarriage the following year, and in her memoirs recounted having to watch on as a nurse threw the remains of the foetus into a bedside fireplace. She was told by doctors that she would never be able to have children, but in fact went on to give birth to twelve – the first born when she was 19 and the last born when she was 36. Her subsequent pregnancies went relatively smoothly, with the exception of a third miscarriage in 1926; she had to carry the dead foetus for three months before it could be removed. All but one of her children survived to adulthood, and all those who did out-lived her. Her son Garnet, born in 1924, died from meningitis at the age of 10 months. Another son, Barry, was born with achondroplasia.

<doc id="1174240" wikidata="Q808725" url="?curid=1174240" title="Baroreflex">
<text>The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body&#x27;s homeostatic mechanisms that helps to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure causes the heart rate to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. Their function is to sense pressure changes by responding to change in the tension of the arterial wall. The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity.

The system relies on specialized neurons, known as baroreceptors, chiefly in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses, to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the medulla oblongata. Baroreceptors are stretch receptors and respond to the pressure induced stretching of the blood vessel in which they are found. Baroreflex-induced changes in blood pressure are mediated by both branches of the autonomic nervous system: the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Baroreceptors are active even at normal blood pressures so their activity informs the brain about both increases and decreases in blood pressure.

The body contains two other, slower-acting systems to regulate blood pressure: the heart releases atrial natriuretic peptide when blood pressure is too high, and the kidneys sense and correct low blood pressure with the renin–angiotensin system.

==Anatomy==
Baroreceptors are present in the atria of the heart and vena cavae, but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch. While the carotid sinus baroreceptor axons travel within the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the aortic arch baroreceptor axons travel within the vagus nerve (CN X). Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves directly into the central nervous system to excite glutamatergic neurons within the solitary nucleus (SN) in the brainstem. Baroreceptor information flows from these NSS neurons to both parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons within the brainstem.

The SN neurons send excitatory fibers (glutamatergic) to the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), activating the CVLM. The activated CVLM then sends inhibitory fibers (GABAergic) to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), thus inhibiting the RVLM. The RVLM is the primary regulator of the sympathetic nervous system, sending excitatory fibers (glutamatergic) to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons located in the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord. Hence, when the baroreceptors are activated (by an increased blood pressure), the NTS activates the CVLM, which in turn inhibits the RVLM, thus decreasing the activity of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, leading to a relative decrease in blood pressure. Likewise, low blood pressure activates baroreceptors less and causes an increase in sympathetic tone via &quot;disinhibition&quot; (less inhibition, hence activation) of the RVLM. Cardiovascular targets of the sympathetic nervous system includes both blood vessels and the heart.

Even at resting levels of blood pressure, arterial baroreceptor discharge activates SN neurons. Some of these SN neurons are tonically activated by this resting blood pressure and thus activate excitatory fibers to the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve to regulate the parasympathetic nervous system. These parasympathetic neurons send axons to the heart and parasympathetic activity slows cardiac pacemaking and thus heart rate. This parasympathetic activity is further increased during conditions of elevated blood pressure. The parasympathetic nervous system is primarily directed toward the heart.

==Activation==
The baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. At low pressures, baroreceptors become inactive. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aortic sinuses are distended further, resulting in increased stretch and, therefore, a greater degree of activation of the baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, many baroreceptors are actively reporting blood pressure information and the baroreflex is actively modulating autonomic activity. Active baroreceptors fire action potentials (&quot;spikes&quot;) more frequently. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. Many individual baroreceptors are inactive at normal resting pressures and only become activated when their stretch or pressure threshold is exceeded.

Baroreceptor mechanosensitivity is hypothesised to be linked to the expression of PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 on neurons in the petrosal and nodose ganglia.

Baroreceptor action potentials are relayed to the solitary nucleus, which uses frequency as a measure of blood pressure. Increased activation of the solitary nucleus inhibits the vasomotor center and stimulates the vagal nuclei. The end-result of baroreceptor activation is inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.

The sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system have opposing effects on blood pressure. Sympathetic activation leads to an elevation of total peripheral resistance and cardiac output via increased contractility of the heart, heart rate, and arterial vasoconstriction, which tends to increase blood pressure. Conversely, parasympathetic activation leads to decreased cardiac output via decrease in heart rate, resulting in a tendency to lower blood pressure.

By coupling sympathetic inhibition and parasympathetic activation, the baroreflex maximizes blood pressure reduction. Sympathetic inhibition leads to a drop in peripheral resistance, while parasympathetic activation leads to a depressed heart rate (reflex bradycardia) and contractility. The combined effects will dramatically decrease blood pressure. In a similar manner, sympathetic activation with parasympathetic inhibition allows the baroreflex to elevate blood pressure.

==Set point and tonic activation==
Baroreceptor firing has an inhibitory effect on sympathetic outflow. The sympathetic neurons fire at different rates which determines the release of norepinephrine onto cardiovascular targets. Norepinephrine constricts blood vessels to increase blood pressure. When baroreceptors are stretched (due to an increased blood pressure) their firing rate increases which in turn decreases the sympathetic outflow resulting in reduced norepinephrine and thus blood pressure. When the blood pressure is low, baroreceptor firing is reduced and this in turn results in augmented sympathetic outflow and increased norepinephrine release on the heart and blood vessels, increasing blood pressure.

==Effect on heart rate variability==
The baroreflex may be responsible for a part of the low-frequency component of heart rate variability, the so-called Mayer waves, at 0.1 Hz.

==Baroreflex activation therapy==
===High blood pressure===

The baroreflex can be used to treat resistant hypertension. This stimulation is provided by a pacemaker-like device. While the devices appears to lower blood pressure, evidence remains very limited as of 2018.

===Heart failure===

The ability of baroreflex activation therapy to reduce sympathetic nerve activity suggests a potential in the treatment of chronic heart failure, because in this condition there is often intense sympathetic activation and patients with such sympathetic activation show a markedly increased risk of fatal arrhythmias and death.

One trial has already shown that baroreflex activation therapy improves functional status, quality of life, exercise capacity and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide.

<text>Prince Hassan bin Talal (, born 20 March 1947) is a member of the Jordanian royal family who was previously Crown Prince from 1965 to 1999, being removed just three weeks before King Hussein&#x27;s death. He is now 20th in line to succeed his nephew King Abdullah II.

==Background and personal life==
Prince El Hassan is a Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He is the third son of King Talal and Queen Zein. He is thus a younger brother of late King Hussein and uncle of the present King Abdullah II.

Prince El Hassan is a descendant of Mohammed. His family is descended in patrilineage from Hassan, the elder of the two sons of Fatima Zahra and Ali, the daughter and son-in-law of Mohammed. {cite}

More recent male-line ancestors served as Sharifs of Mecca. In the early 1900s, the kingdom of Hejaz was set up in western Arabia by the Western powers in order to torment the Ottoman empire, and Hassan&#x27;s great-grandfather, already Grand Sharif of Mecca, was made king of this state. That kingdom did not last long, being soon conquered by Al Saud. However, one of the sons of the Grand Sharif, Prince El Hassan&#x27;s grandfather, King Abdullah I, became king of Transjordan in 1946. In 1949, after annexing the West Bank in Palestine, and &quot;uniting&quot; both banks of the Jordan River, it was constitutionally renamed the &quot;Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&quot;, commonly referred to nowadays as Kingdom of Jordan.

===Marriage and issue===
In 1968, Prince El Hassan married Sarvath Ikramullah, whose family belongs to the feudal aristocracy of Bhopal state in central India. Her father, Mohammed Ikramullah, was an Indian politician who chose to move to Pakistan at Partition and became a diplomat there. His brother (Princess Sarvath&#x27;s uncle), Mohammad Hidayatullah, choosing to remain in India, rose to become the 11th Chief Justice of India and then, after retirement from the judiciary, became the 6th Vice President of India. Princess Sarvath&#x27;s mother, Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah, came from the prominent Suhrawardy family of Undivided Bengal. She was the daughter of Hassan Suhrawardy and first cousin of former Prime Minister of undivided Pakistan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. 

Prince El Hassan and Begum Sarvath Ikramullah first met in London in 1958, when they were both mere children. Their families knew each other very well and they played together as children. In the mid-1960s, they married with the full consent of their families. They have four children together:

* Princess Rahma (born 13 August 1969)
* Princess Sumaya (born 14 May 1971)
* Princess Badiya (born 28 March 1974)
* Prince Rashid (born 20 May 1979)

==Education==
Prince El Hassan was educated first in Amman. He then attended Sandroyd School in Wiltshire before going on to Summer Fields School, Oxford, followed by Harrow School in England, then Christ Church, a college of the University of Oxford, where he graduated BA with Honours in Oriental Studies and later proceeded to MA. Hassan is fluent in Arabic, English, French and German. He has a working knowledge of Turkish and Spanish, and studied Hebrew at university.

==Career==
In 1965, Hassan was named as Crown Prince of Jordan after the constitution was amended. He was frequently regent during his brother&#x27;s absences from the country. During Hussein&#x27;s final illness in January 1999, he was replaced by his nephew Abdullah three weeks before the king died. Abdullah subsequently inherited the throne of Jordan.

In 2009, he joined the project &quot;Soldiers of Peace&quot;, a film against all wars and for global peace.

On 10 June 2013, he was appointed as the chairman of the advisory board on water and sanitation (UNSGAB) by the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

===Removal as Crown Prince===
As King Hussein was undergoing cancer treatment in mid-1998, the King assigned Crown Prince El Hassan a range of powers and authority to act as regent. With his newly gained powers, Hassan exercised a number of steps to consolidate his position as heir and future king, which included: (1) &quot;orchestrating the removal of the [unpopular] government&quot; of Abdelsalam Majali and appointing former Royal Court chief Fayez al-Tarawneh in his place, (2) organizing dialogue and reconciliation with opposition groups, most prominently the Muslim Brotherhood, and (3) attempting to effect changes at the top of the military. Hassan&#x27;s attempted changes to the top hierarchy of the military angered King Hussein and led him to resume full duties as king. It is also a commonly cited reason for Hassan&#x27;s removal as crown prince on 24 January 1999. Hassan&#x27;s removal took shape through a 14-page typed letter, described by American historian W. Andrew Terrill as &quot;extremely harsh&quot;, in which King Hussein expressed &quot;unmistakable disappointment in Crown Prince El Hassan&quot; and ordered his replacement with Hussein&#x27;s son Abdullah. Terrill describes King Hussein as perhaps having felt that Hassan had &quot;interest in shifting the line of succession to his own family&quot;, which led to his dismissal as Crown Prince three weeks before Hussein&#x27;s death.

Crown Prince El Hassan&#x27;s attempted consolidation of power led the sickly King Hussein to break off &quot;intensive&quot; treatments for lymphoma and fly back home to Jordan in order to address the issue. At first, the King attempted to negotiate with Hassan, placing the King&#x27;s younger son Hamzah as Hassan&#x27;s crown prince to ensure that the line of succession would not switch to Hassan&#x27;s line. However, Hassan&#x27;s Pakistani wife Sarvath vetoed the proposal, particularly because of her reported distaste for Hamzah&#x27;s American-born mother Queen Noor and her desire to have her son Prince Rashid in the line of succession. King Hussein instead replaced Hassan with his own son Abdullah, who had backing within the military and whose position as eldest son of the king would allow him to be enthroned by royal fiat, unlike Hamzah whose enthronement would require confirmation from the Jordanian Parliament.

He founded the Royal Scientific Society in 1970, the Annual Bilad Al-Sham Conference in 1978, and the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought in 1980.

===Abraham Geiger Award===
The 2008 Abraham Geiger Award, named after liberal thinker of Judaism Abraham Geiger (1810–1874), was conferred upon Prince El Hassan bin Talal. The award ceremony was held in Berlin on 4 March 2008. Past recipients include Cardinal Karl Lehmann, Alfred Grosser, Emil Fackenheim and Susannah Heschel.

&quot;Honouring the President Emeritus of the World Conference of Religions for Peace underlines Prince El Hassan&#x27;s courage in defending pluralism, promoting understanding among different cultures and enhancing dialogue between Jews, Muslims and Christians. The Prince&#x27;s efforts to promote understanding between the Islamic and Western Worlds are crucial at a time when we seem to be drifting apart, with perceived differences appearing to overwhelm the many things we have in common, both culturally and religiously.&quot;

<doc id="1174243" wikidata="Q2622113" url="?curid=1174243" title="Al Waxman">
<text>Albert Samuel Waxman, (March 2, 1935 – January 18, 2001) was a Canadian actor and director of over 1,000 productions on radio, television, film, and stage. He is best known for his starring roles in the television series &quot;King of Kensington&quot; (CBC), &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; (CBS) and &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; (CTV).

==Early life==
Waxman was born in Toronto, Ontario to Jewish immigrants from Poland. His parents operated and owned Melinda Lunch, a small restaurant. His father, Aaron Waxman, died when Al was nine.

==Career==
Waxman&#x27;s career began at the age of twelve on CBC Radio, but it was not until 1975, when he began playing the role of Larry King on CBC&#x27;s &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, that he became a Canadian icon.

In the 1980 award-winning film &quot;Atlantic City&quot; starring Burt Lancaster, Waxman appeared as a rich cocaine buyer with a seemingly endless amount of cash.

During the 1980s, Waxman starred as the gruff but endearing Lt. Bert Samuels in the highly successful CBS television drama &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;.

During the 1990s, Waxman appeared in a variety of films and television shows, but began spending more time acting and directing in the theatre. In 1991, Al hosted &quot;Missing Treasures: The Search for Our Lost Children&quot;, a TV show which profiled missing children in Canada. He was also a founding member of the Academy of Canadian Cinema &amp; Television.

In 1997, he was awarded the best actor Gemini Award for his performance in the television film &quot;Net Worth&quot;.

Waxman also appeared at the Stratford Festival, beginning with his critically acclaimed performance as Willy Loman in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; in 1997. He also directed &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; at the Stratford Festival in 2000. He was to return to Stratford for his highly anticipated portrayal of Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in 2001. In the wake of Waxman&#x27;s death, one month before rehearsals were to begin, Paul Soles accepted the part of Shylock and the play was performed in honour of Waxman.

In 1999, he published a memoir &quot;That&#x27;s What I Am&quot; which received a Canadian Jewish Book Award.

==Community activism==

Waxman was a spokesperson for organizations such as United Appeal, United Jewish Appeal, Israel Bonds, Variety Club, Children&#x27;s Miracle Network, and Big Brothers (also becoming an honorary member). From June 1979 to August 1981, he was the National Campaign Chairman for the Canadian Cancer Society, and from 1988 to 1989, he was an official spokesperson for the Heart &amp; Stroke Foundation of Ontario. Together with his wife, Sara, he created the Sara and Al Waxman Center for Maternal and Fetal Medicine at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.

Al Waxman was accorded many tributes for his volunteer and philanthropic work. In 1978, he was honoured with the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1989, he was the recipient of the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith of Canada Humanitarian Award. In 1996, Waxman was inducted into the Order of Ontario and, in 1997, into the Order of Canada. In 1998, he was given the Earle Grey Award for lifetime achievement in Canadian television.

==Death and legacy==
Waxman died in Toronto during heart surgery on January 18, 2001, at the age of 65. He was buried at Pardes Shalom Cemetery in Maple, Ontario.

In 2016, Al Waxman was posthumously inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame as a Cineplex Legends Inductee for his enormous contribution to Canadian arts and culture as an actor, director, producer, and consummate and integral supporter of the Canadian film industry and young aspiring artists emerging within it.

Following his death, a statue of him, created by Ruth Abernethy, was erected in Kensington Market, the Toronto neighbourhood where &quot;King of Kensington&quot; takes place. The inscription in front of the statue reads &quot;There&#x27;s lots to do down the road, there&#x27;s always more. Trust your gut instincts. In small matters trust your mind, but in the important decisions of life – trust your heart.&quot;

Musician Jaymz Bee started the Al Waxman Fan Club while in high school, and started a punk band with his pals Bazl Salazar, Clay Tyson and Graham Leethat performed only songs about Waxman and his life: &quot;&#x27;We ended up with an hour-long show, just about Al Waxman.&#x27;&quot; What began as a publicity stunt became a long association between Bee and Waxman. Waxman attended some of the fan club events as organized by Bee, most of which raised money for charities such as the Canadian Cancer Foundation and Big Brother. Bee attended Waxman&#x27;s funeral and, with his fan club, held a wake in Toronto on January 25, 2001.

<text>VS-931 Antisubmarine Squadron was activated at Willow Grove Naval Air Station in Pennsylvania on 1 March 1951 during the Korean War and was transferred to Los Alamitos Naval Air Station in California. The squadron was sent abroad on the USS &quot;Sicily&quot; and operated near Japan and Okinawa. Upon transferring to the USS &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot;, the Squadron went to Korea on two occasions to protect the US Naval fleet from enemy submarines. There were several transfers back and forth between the two ships and in addition the squadron was stationed on land bases at Atsugi and Itami for brief periods. The squadron returned to the States aboard the USS Sicily. Upon returning to Los Alamitos the squadron&#x27;s designation was changed from VS-931 to VS-20.

<text>CSS &quot;Chicora&quot; was a Confederate ironclad ram that fought in the American Civil War. It was built under contract at Charleston, South Carolina in 1862. James M. Eason built it to John L. Porter&#x27;s plans, using up most of a $300,000 State appropriation for construction of marine batteries; Eason received a bonus for &quot;skill and promptitude.&quot; Its iron shield was thick, backed by of oak and pine, with armor at its ends. Keeled in March, it was commissioned in November, Commander John Randolph Tucker, CSN assuming command.

In thick, predawn haze on January 31, 1863, &quot;Chicora&quot; and raided the Federal blockading force of unarmored ships lying just outside the entrance to Charleston Harbor. With ram and gun, &quot;Palmetto State&quot; forced to surrender, then disabled , who had to be towed to safety. &quot;Chicora&quot; meanwhile engaged other Union ships in a long-range gun duel, from which it emerged unscathed to withdraw victoriously to shelter inside the harbor.
It took part in the defense of the forts at Charleston on April 7 when they were attacked by a squadron of ironclad monitors under Rear Admiral Samuel Francis du Pont, USN. The Federal ships were forced to retire for repairs and did not resume the action.

&quot;Chicora&quot; was actively employed in the fighting around Charleston during 1863 and 1864. Its valuable services included the transporting of troops during the evacuation of Morris Island, and the bombardment of Forts Sumter, Gregg, and Wagner. In August 1863 she had the distinction of furnishing the first volunteer officer and crew for the Confederate Submarine Torpedo Boat &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot;.
&quot;A Lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the Confederate States Navy was conferred on me, with orders to report for duty on the ironclad Chicora at Charleston. My duties were those of a deck officer, and I had charge of the first division. On the occasion of the attack upon the blockading squadron ... It was my part, on the memorable morning, to aim and fire one effective shell into the Keystone State while running down to attack us, which (according to Captain LeRoy&#x27;s report), killing twenty-one men and severely wounding fifteen, caused him to haul down his flag in token of surrender. The enemy now kept at a respectful distance while preparing their ironclad vessels to sail up more closely. Our Navy Department continued slowly to construct more of these rams, all on the same general plan, fit for little else than harbor defense.&quot; -- William T. Glassell, Lt. CSN
It was destroyed by the Confederates when Charleston was evacuated on February 18, 1865.

<text>George Tyssen Butler (12 October 1943 – 21 October 2021) was a British-American filmmaker and photographer, and a pioneer of the theatrical documentary. Some of his most popular films include &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; (1977), which introduced a wider audience to Arnold Schwarzenegger, &quot;The Endurance&quot; films, retelling Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s saga of Antarctic survival, and &quot;Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry&quot; (2004), about his friend John Kerry&#x27;s leadership in the peace movement.

Butler&#x27;s films are known for their combination of high artistic, educational and entertainment values, as he believed well-crafted documentaries can hold their own against dramatic features. In addition to his feature-length documentary classics, Butler has also produced acclaimed IMAX features, such as the award-winning &quot;Shackleton&#x27;s Antarctic Adventure&quot; (2001) and &quot;Roving Mars&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Born in Chester, England on 12 October 1943, Butler grew up in Somalia, Kenya, and Jamaica, the son of Dorothy (West) and Tyssen Desmond Butler. His father was a British Army officer and his mother was an American Boston Brahmin socialite. Butler jokingly described himself as &quot;half American, half Irish, and half English.&quot;

Butler attended the Groton School before graduating from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1966. He received a Master of Arts degree in creative writing from Hollins College in 1968.

== Career ==
After completing his M.A. degree, Butler worked as a reporter for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Objecting to the Vietnam War, he joined VISTA (the domestic Peace Corps) as a volunteer, working in the inner city of Detroit&#x27;s North End, where he established a successful community newspaper, &quot;The Oakland Lion&quot;. The author of a number of books, Butler collaborated with David Thorne and former Secretary of State John Kerry on &quot;The New Soldier&quot; (1971), a highly praised book about the Vietnam Veterans Against War.

In 1972, a photo assignment for &quot;Life&quot; magazine to cover the Mr. Universe Championship inspired Butler to make a theatrical documentary on the subject of bodybuilding; this proved to be a challenging undertaking, as he had difficulty convincing potential investors that bodybuilders and their Austrian-accented star performer could hold the screen. The eventual movie &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; launched Arnold Schwarzenegger, put bodybuilding and the gym business on the map, and became a film classic. With &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;, George Butler established White Mountain Films, named for the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where he made his home.

White Mountain Films has gone on to create some of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed documentaries made. Butler&#x27;s films have screened at festivals such as Sundance, Telluride, Toronto, Leningrad and Full Frame, and won honors ranging from National Board of Review Best Documentary of the Year (2001, &quot;The Endurance&quot;), IDA Best Documentary finalist (1990, &quot;In the Blood&quot;), the Whitney Biennial (2006, &quot;Going Upriver&quot;), National Academy of Science Best Science Film of the Year (2008, &quot;Roving Mars&quot;) to the Warner Prize for Best Director, Environmental Film Festival (2015, &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot;).

== Photography ==
Butler&#x27;s photographs have appeared in many major publications including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His work has been showcased in a one-man show at the International Center of Photography in New York, and exhibited in the Detroit collection, among other galleries around the country. Additionally, Butler is known for his life-size portraits of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

==Unfinished projects==
A lifelong conservationist (&quot;The Lord God Bird&quot;, &quot;In the Blood&quot;), Butler was working on a two-film project—a feature documentary and an IMAX film—about the imperiled tiger. Both films follow world-renowned big cat biologist Dr. Alan Rabinowitz as he travels deep into the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, searching for its legendary royal Bengal tigers—one of the world&#x27;s largest remaining tiger populations, and last hopes for the species&#x27; survival. The IMAX film is scheduled for release in 2023.

Reportedly, White Mountain Films is also developing a medical thriller probing the mystery of how &quot;shell shock&quot; affects the brains of soldiers and veterans. The project is based on author Caroline Alexander&#x27;s &quot;National Geographic&quot; cover story.

== Personal life ==
Butler, who had been battling Parkinson&#x27;s disease, died from pneumonia at his farm in Holderness, New Hampshire, on 21 October 2021, at the age of 78.

<text>Anders Gideon Tom Ståhlberg (26 January 1908 – 26 May 1967) was a Swedish chess player. He was among the inaugural recipients of the title International Grandmaster from FIDE in 1950.

He won the Swedish Chess Championship of 1927, became Nordic champion in 1929, and held it until 1939.

Ståhlberg came to fame when he won matches against star players Rudolf Spielmann and Aron Nimzowitsch in 1933 and 1934 respectively, and came third (after Alexander Alekhine) in Dresden 1936, and second (after Reuben Fine) in Stockholm 1937. In 1938 he drew a match against Paul Keres.
Following the Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires 1939, he stayed in Argentina until 1948, where he won many tournaments, some of them in competition with Miguel Najdorf: Mar del Plata 1941 (ahead of Najdorf and Erich Eliskases), Buenos Aires 1941 (tied with Najdorf), Buenos Aires 1947 (ahead of Najdorf, Eliskases and Max Euwe).

His best results after returning to Europe were: the Interzonal of Saltsjöbaden 1948 (6th, becoming a candidate), the Candidates tournament of Budapest 1950 (7th), Amsterdam 1950 (3rd), Budapest 1952 (3rd), the Interzonal of Saltsjöbaden 1952 (5th, again becoming a candidate)

Ståhlberg umpired in the five World Championships between 1957 and 1963.

In 1967 he travelled to Leningrad to take part in an international tournament but died before playing his first game. He was buried in Gothenburg.

Ståhlberg published more than ten chess books (some of them originally in Spanish):
* &quot;Schack och schackmästare&quot;, 1937 (&quot;Chess and Chess Masters&quot;, 1955)
* &quot;El gambito de dama&quot;, 1942 (Queen&#x27;s gambit)
* &quot;Partidas clásicas de Capablanca (La perfección en ajedrez)&quot;, 1943 (with Paulino Alles Monasterio) (Classic games of Capablanca, perfection in chess)
* &quot;I kamp med världseliten&quot;, 1958 (In battle against the world elite)
* &quot;Strövtåg i schackvärlden&quot; (Excursions in the world of chess, 1965)
* &quot;Tal-Botvinnik II match&quot;, 1969
* &quot;Modern spelöppningsteori i schack&quot; (Modern opening theory in chess)

<doc id="1174254" wikidata="Q2630039" url="?curid=1174254" title="New Zealand Army">
<text>The New Zealand Army (, ) is the principal land warfare force of New Zealand, a component of the New Zealand Defence Force alongside the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

Formed in 1845, as the New Zealand Military Forces, the Army traces its history from settler militia raised in that same year. The current name was adopted by the New Zealand Army Act 1950.

During its history, the New Zealand Army has fought in a number of major wars, including the Second Boer War, the First and Second World Wars, Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Vietnam War, and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Since the 1970s, deployments have tended to be assistance to multilateral peacekeeping efforts. Considering the small size of the force, operational commitments have remained high since the start of the East Timor deployment in 1999. New Zealand personnel also served in several UN and other peacekeeping missions including the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, the Sinai, South Sudan and Sudan.

==History==

===Colonial conflicts===

War had been an integral part of the life and culture of the Māori, even prior to European contact. The Musket Wars continued this trend and dominated the first years of European trade and settlement.

The first European settlers in the Bay of Islands formed a volunteer militia from which some New Zealand Army units trace their origins. British forces and Māori fought in various New Zealand Wars starting in 1843, and culminating in the Invasion of the Waikato in the mid-1860s, during which colonial forces were used with great effect. From the 1870s, the numbers of Imperial (British) troops was reduced, leaving settler units to continue the campaign.

The first permanent military force was the Colonial Defence Force, which was active in 1862. This was replaced in 1867 by the Armed Constabulary, which performed both military and policing roles. After being renamed the New Zealand Constabulary Force, it was divided into separate military and police forces in 1886. The military force was called the Permanent Militia and later renamed the Permanent Force.

===Second Boer War===
Major Alfred William Robin led the First Contingent sent from New Zealand to South Africa to participate in the Boer War in October 1899. The New Zealand Army sent ten contingents in total (including the 4th New Zealand Contingent), of which the first six were raised and instructed by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Henry Banks, who led the 6th Contingent into battle. These were mounted riflemen, and the first contingents had to pay to go, providing their own horses, equipment and weapons.

The Defence Act 1909, which displaced the old volunteer system, remodelled the defences of the dominion on a territorial basis, embodying the principles of universal service between certain ages. It provided for a territorial force, or fighting strength, fully equipped for modern requirements, of thirty thousand men. These troops, with the territorial reserve, formed the first line; and the second line comprised rifle clubs and training sections. Under the terms of the Act, every male, unless physically unfit, was required to take his share of the defence of the dominion. The Act provided for the gradual military training of every male from the age of 14 to 25, after which he was required to serve in the reserve up to the age of thirty. From the age of 12 to 14, every boy at school performed a certain amount of military training, and, on leaving, was transferred to the senior cadets, with whom he remained, undergoing training, until 18 years of age, when he joined the territorials. After serving in the territorials until 25 (or less if earlier reliefs were recommended), and in the reserve until 30, a discharge was granted; but the man remained liable under the Militia Act to be called up, until he reached the age of 55. As a result of Lord Kitchener&#x27;s visit to New Zealand in 1910, slight alterations were made—chiefly affecting the general and administrative staffs, and which included the establishment of the New Zealand Staff Corps—and the scheme was set in motion in January, 1911. Major-General Sir Alexander Godley, of the Imperial General Staff, was engaged as commandant.

===First World War===
Following the outbreak of the First World War, New Zealand raised the initially all volunteer New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service overseas. A smaller expeditionary force, the Samoa Expeditionary Force, was tasked to occupy German Samoa, which it achieved without resistance.

The NZEF would be sent to Egypt and would participate in the Gallipoli Campaign under the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). The New Zealand Division was then formed which fought on the Western Front and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade fought in Palestine. After Major General Godley departed with the NZEF in October 1914, Major General Alfred William Robin commanded New Zealand Military Forces at home throughout the war, as commandant.

The total number of New Zealand troops and nurses to serve overseas in 1914–1918, excluding those in British and other dominion forces, was 100,000, from a population of just over a million. Forty-two percent of men of military age served in the NZEF. 16,697 New Zealanders were killed and 41,317 were wounded during the war—a 58 percent casualty rate. Approximately a further thousand men died within five years of the war&#x27;s end, as a result of injuries sustained, and 507 died whilst training in New Zealand between 1914 and 1918. New Zealand had one of the highest casualty—and death—rates per capita of any country involved in the war.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (I.E. 2nd Division) fought in Greece, Crete, the Western Desert campaign and the Italian campaign. Among its units was the famed 28th Māori Battalion. Following Japan&#x27;s entry into the war, 3rd Division, 2 NZEF IP (in Pacific) saw action in the Pacific, seizing a number of islands from the Japanese. New Zealanders contributed to various Allied special forces units, such as the original Long Range Desert Group in North Africa and Z Force in the Pacific.As part of the preparations for the possible outbreak of war in the Pacific, the defensive forces stationed in New Zealand were expanded in late 1941. On 1 November, three new brigade headquarters were raised (taking the total in the New Zealand Army to seven), and three divisional headquarters were established to coordinate the units located in the Northern, Central and Southern Military Districts. The division in the Northern Military District was designated the Northern Division, and comprised the 1st and 12th Brigade Groups. Northern Division later became 1st Division. 4th Division was established in the Central Military District (with 2nd and 7th brigades), and 5th in the south (with 3rd, 10th and 11th brigades).

The forces stationed in New Zealand were considerably reduced as the threat of invasion passed. During early 1943, each of the three home defence divisions were cut from 22,358 to 11,530 men. The non-divisional units suffered even greater reductions. The New Zealand government ordered a general stand-down of the defensive forces in the country on 28 June, which led to further reductions in the strength of units and a lower state of readiness. By the end of the year, almost all of the Territorial Force personnel had been demobilised (though they retained their uniforms and equipment), and only 44 soldiers were posted to the three divisional and seven brigade headquarters. The war situation continued to improve, and the 4th Division, along with the other two divisions and almost all the remaining Territorial Force units, was disbanded on 1 April 1944.

The 6th New Zealand Division was also briefly formed as a deception formation by renaming the NZ camp at Maadi in southern Cairo, the New Zealanders&#x27; base area in Egypt, in 1942. In addition, the 1st Army Tank Brigade (New Zealand) was also active for a time.

=== Cold War ===

==== Post-War ====
The New Zealand Army was formed from the New Zealand Military Forces following the Second World War. Attention focused on preparing a third Expeditionary Force potentially for service against the Soviets. Compulsory military training was introduced to man the force, which was initially division-sized. The New Zealand Army Act 1950 stipulated that the Army would consist from then on of Army Troops (army headquarters, Army Schools, and base units); District Troops (Northern Military District, Central and Southern Military Districts, the 12 subordinate area HQs, elementary training elements, coastal artillery and composite AA regiments); and the New Zealand Division, the mobile striking force. The division was alternatively known as &#x27;3NZEF&#x27;.

==== Korean War ====
The Army&#x27;s first combat after the Second World War was in the Korean War, which began with North Korea&#x27;s invasion of the South on 25 June 1950. After some debate, on 26 July 1950, the New Zealand government announced it would raise a volunteer military force to serve with the United Nations Command in Korea. The idea was opposed initially by Chief of the General Staff, Major-General Keith Lindsay Stewart, who did not believe the force would be large enough to be self-sufficient. His opposition was overruled and the government raised what was known as Kayforce, a total of 1,044 men selected from among volunteers. 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery and support elements arrived later during the conflict from New Zealand. The force arrived at Pusan on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and on 21 January, joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade representing the 1st Commonwealth Division, along with Australian, Canadian, and Indian forces. The New Zealanders immediately saw combat and spent the next two and a half years taking part in the operations which led the United Nations forces back to and over the 38th Parallel, later recapturing Seoul in the process.

The majority of Kayforce had returned to New Zealand by 1955, though it was not until 1957 that the last New Zealand soldiers had left Korea. In all, about 4700 men served with Kayforce.

In 1957, the 9th Coast Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, was reduced to a cadre along with the other coastal artillery regiments (10th and 11th). Personnel were gradually run down until there was only a single supervisory District Gunner. All three were disbanded in 1967.

==== Irregular warfare ====
Through the 1950s, New Zealand Army forces were deployed to the Malayan Emergency, and the Confrontation with Indonesia. A Special Air Service squadron was raised for this commitment, but most forces came from the New Zealand infantry battalion in the Malaysia–Singapore area. The battalion was committed to the Far East Strategic Reserve.

The 1957 national government defence review directed the discontinuation of coastal defence training, and the approximately 1000 personnel of the 9th, 10th, and 11th coastal regiments Royal New Zealand Artillery had their compulsory military training obligation removed. A small cadre of regulars remained, but as Henderson, Green, and Cook say, &#x27;the coastal artillery had quietly died.&#x27; All the fixed guns were dismantled and sold for scrap by the early 1960s. After 1945, the Valentine tanks in service were eventually replaced by about ten M41 Walker Bulldogs, supplemented by a small number of Centurion tanks. Eventually, both were superseded by FV101 Scorpion armoured reconnaissance vehicles.

==== Vietnam War ====

New Zealand sent troops to the Vietnam War in 1964 because of Cold War concerns and alliance considerations.

Initial contributions were a New Zealand team of non-combat army engineers in 1964 followed by a battery from the Royal New Zealand Artillery in 1965 which served initially with the Americans until the formation of the 1st Australian Task Force in 1966. Thereafter, the battery served with the task force until 1971.

Two Companies of New Zealand infantry, Whisky Company and Victor Company, served with the 1st Australian Task Force from 1967 until 1971. Some also served with the Australian and New Zealand Army Training teams until 1972.

NZ SAS arrived in 1968 and served with the Australian SAS until the Australian and New Zealand troop withdrawal in 1971.

Members from various branches of the NZ Army also served with U.S and Australian air and cavalry detachments as well as in intelligence, medical, and engineering. In all, 3850 military personnel from all military branches of service served in Vietnam. New Zealand infantry accounted for approximately 1600 and the New Zealand artillery battery accounted for approximately 750.
=== Peacekeeping operations ===

The New Zealand Division was disbanded in 1961, as succeeding governments reduced the force, first to two brigades, and then a single one. This one-brigade force became, in the 1980s, the Integrated Expansion Force, to be formed by producing three composite battalions from the six Territorial Force infantry regiments. In 1978, a national museum for the Army, the QEII Army Memorial Museum, was built at Waiouru, the Army&#x27;s main training base in the central North Island.

After the 1983 Defence Review, the Army&#x27;s command structure was adjusted to distinguish more clearly the separate roles of operations and base support training. There was an internal reorganisation within the Army General Staff, and New Zealand Land Forces Command in Takapuna was split into a Land Force Command and a Support Command. Land Force Command, which from then on comprised 1st Task Force in the North Island and the 3rd Task Force in the South Island, assumed responsibility for operational forces, Territorial Force manpower management and collective training. Support Command which from then on comprised three elements, the Army Training Group in Waiouru, the Force Maintenance Group (FMG) based in Linton, and Base Area Wellington (BAW) based in Trentham, assumed responsibility for individual training, third line logistics and base support. Headquarters Land Force Command remained at Takapuna, and Headquarters Support Command was moved to Palmerston North.

The Army was prepared to field a Ready Reaction Force which was a battalion group based on 2/1 RNZIR; the Integrated Expansion Force (17 units) brigade sized, which would be able to follow up 90 days after mobilization; and a Force Maintenance Group of 19 units to provide logistical support to both forces.

The battalion in South East Asia, designated 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment by that time, was brought home in 1989.

In the late 1980s, Exercise Golden Fleece was held in the North Island. It was the largest exercise for a long period.

During the later part of the 20th century, New Zealand personnel served in a large number of UN and other peacekeeping deployments including:
* United Nations Truce Supervision Organization for over 50 years in the Middle East
* Operation Agila in Rhodesia 
* Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in the Sinai
* Cambodia where members of the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals (RNZSigs) were attached to the Australian Force Communications Unit (FCU) of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. 
* The New Zealand Supply Contingent Somalia of the larger United Nations Operation in Somalia I and United Nations Operation in Somalia II until March 1994. 
* United Nations Accelerated Demining Programme (ADP) in Mozambique 
* United Nations Angola Verification Mission II in Angola
* United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia 
* The Endeavour Peace Accord, Bougainville

In 1994, the Army was granted a status of iwidom as &quot;Ngāti Tūmatauenga&quot; with the blessings of the Māori Queen Te Atairangikaahu and surrounding tribes of the base in Waiouru: Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngāti Tuhoe.

=== Recent history (1999–present) ===
In the 21st century, New Zealanders have served in East Timor (1999 onwards), Afghanistan, and Iraq.

NZDF forces have also been involved in international Peacekeeping actions such as Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (2003–2015), United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (2003–), United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre in Southern Lebanon (2007–2008), and United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (2011.)

In 2003, the New Zealand government decided to replace its existing fleet of M113 armoured personnel carriers, purchased in the 1960s, with the Canadian-built NZLAV, and the M113s were decommissioned by the end of 2004. An agreement made to sell the M113s via an Australian weapons dealer in February 2006 had to be cancelled when the US State Department refused permission for New Zealand to sell the M113s under a contract made when the vehicles were initially purchased. The replacement of the M113s with the General Motors LAV III (NZLAV) led to a review in 2001 on the purchase decision-making by New Zealand&#x27;s auditor-general. The review found shortcomings in the defence acquisition process, but not in the eventual vehicle selection.
In 2010, the government said it would look at the possibility of selling 35 LAVs, around a third of the fleet, as being surplus to requirements.

On 4 September 2010, in the aftermath of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, the New Zealand Defence Force deployed to the worst affected areas of Christchurch to aid in relief efforts and assist NZ police in enforcing a night time curfew at the request of Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker and Prime Minister John Key.

On the 21st of March, 2022, New Zealand announced that it would provide NZ$5 million for the purpose of non-lethal military equipment through NATO to Ukraine, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In addition, several surplus army equipment was donated, including 473 Enhanced Combat Helmets, 1,066 body armour plates and 571 flak vests and webbing. On the 11th of April this was followed by dispatching 50 troops to Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom, primarily for logistics and intelligence purposes as a partner of NATO. On the 23rd May 2022 it was announced that the Army was to send 30 soldiers to the United Kingdom to assist in training Ukrainian forces on the L119 light gun as part of Operation Interflex. This was in addition to providing 40 gun sights and ammunition for training purposes. It was announced that further analysists were sent to the United Kingdom on the 27th of June 2022. On the 15th of August, the NZDF announced it would send 120 army instructors to the United Kingdom, for the purposes of training basic infantry. The training is based on an expedited variant of the British Army&#x27;s basic soldier course, covering weapon handling, combat first aid, operational law and other soldier skills.

At no point were New Zealand forces deployed within Ukraine itself.

==Structure==
The New Zealand Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (Chief of the General Staff until 2002), who is a major general or two-star appointment. , the current Chief of Army is Major General Rose King. The Chief of Army has responsibility for raising, training and sustaining those forces necessary to meet agreed government outputs. For operations, the Army&#x27;s combat units fall under the command of the Land Component Commander, who is on the staff of the COMJFNZ at Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand at Trentham in Upper Hutt. Forces under the Land Component Commander include the 1st Brigade, Training and Doctrine Command, and the Joint Support Group (including health, military police).

No. 3 Squadron RNZAF provides tactical air transport.

===Army Reserve===
The Territorial Force (TF), the long established reserve component of the New Zealand Army, has as of 2009–2010 been renamed the Army Reserve, in line with other Commonwealth countries, though the term &quot;Territorial Force&quot; remains the official nomenclature in the Defence Act 1990. It provides individual augmentees and formed bodies for operational deployments. There are Reserve units throughout New Zealand, and they have a long history. The modern Army Reserve is divided into three regionally-based battalion groups. Each of these is made up of smaller units of different specialities. The terms &#x27;regiment&#x27; and &#x27;battalion group&#x27; seem to be interchangeably used, which can cause confusion. However, it can be argued that both are accurate in slightly different senses. In a tactical sense, given that the Reserve units are groupings of all arms, the term &#x27;battalion group&#x27; is accurate, though usually used for a much more single-arm heavy grouping, three infantry companies plus one armoured squadron, for example. NZ reserve battalion groups are composed of a large number of small units of different types.

The term &#x27;regiment&#x27; can be accurately applied in the British regimental systems sense, as all the subunits collectively have been given the heritage of the former NZ infantry regiments (1900–1964). TF regiments prepare and provide trained individuals in order to top-up and sustain operational and non-operational units to meet directed outputs. TF regiments perform the function of a training unit, preparing individuals to meet prescribed outputs. The six regiments command all Territorial Force personnel within their region except those posted to formation or command headquarters, Military Police (MP) Company, Force Intelligence Group (FIG) or 1 New Zealand Special Air Services (NZSAS) Regiment. At a minimum, each regiment consists of a headquarters, a recruit induction training (RIT) company, at least one rifle company, and a number of combat support or combat service support companies or platoons.

3/1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, previously existed on paper as a cadre. If needed, it would have been raised to full strength through the regimentation of the Territorial Force infantry units. Army plans now envisage a three manoeuvre unit structure of 1 RNZIR, QAMR, and 2/1 RNZIR (light), being brought up to strength by TF individual and subunit reinforcements.

The New Zealand Cadet Corps also exists as an army-affiliated youth training and development organisation, part of the New Zealand Cadet Forces.

A rationalisation plan to amalgamate the then existing six Reserve Regiments to three, and to abolish one third of Reserve personnel posts, had been mooted for some years. This was finally agreed by the New Zealand government in August 2011, and was implemented in 2012.

The New Zealand Scottish Regiment, a Territorial Force regiment first established in January 1939, and perpetuating the battle honors of the Divisional Cavalry of the 2nd New Zealand Division, was finally disbanded in April 2016. After a final parade on April 16, 2016, its Regimental 
Colours were laid up in the Toitu Otago Settlers Museum, Dunedin.

The Territorial Forces Employer Support Council is an organisation that provides support to Reserve personnel of all three services and their civilian employers. It is a national organisation appointed by the minister of defence to work with employers and assist in making Reserve personnel available for operational deployments.

== Personnel ==

=== Strength ===
The Army comprises around 4,659 Regular Force personnel and 2,122 Reserve Force personnel.

=== Uniforms ===

Like all Commonwealth countries uniforms of the New Zealand Army had historically followed those of the British Army. From World War II until the late 1950s British Battledress was worn, with British-issue &quot;Jungle Greens&quot; being used as field wear with Beret or Khaki Cap and British Boonie hat (usually called a &quot;J hat&quot;) during the Malayan Emergency, Borneo and the earlier stages of the Vietnam War.

After initially serving with the U.S Army, New Zealand forces in Vietnam were amalgamated into the 1st Australian Task Force in 1966 and adopted Australian Jungle Greens (&quot;JGs&quot;) from 1967. Uniforms were initially supplied from 1ATF stocks but were eventually made in New Zealand. In the early part of the war New Zealanders wore a black cravat embroidered with a small white Kiwi bird, a practice which began in Borneo in 1966. At first this was worn as part of the formal dress (although never official) but as the JGs worn by New Zealanders were almost identical to their Australian counterparts, the cravat was then sometimes worn on operations to distinguish them from Australians. Some local acquisition of U.S uniforms and equipment also occurred. The American uniforms were said to be popular with platoon leaders, mortar crew, and artillery men due to ease of carrying maps and documents. 

The Australian JGs underwent some modifications to resemble U.S fatigues in 1968 and these new uniforms, nicknamed &quot;pixie suits&quot; (for the slant of the shirt pockets) were worn by New Zealand and Australian troops until the end of the war.

The New Zealand Special Air Service were issued with standard U.S battle dress uniform fatigues in ERDL camouflage pattern during the Vietnam War period and through the 1970s thereafter.

Jungle Greens continued to be used as field wear by the New Zealand Army throughout the 1970s until the introduction of Military camouflage in 1980 and a return to British-style field uniforms. British DPM was adopted in 1980 as the camouflage pattern for clothing, the colours of which were further modified several times to better suit New Zealand conditions. This evolved pattern is now officially referred to as New Zealand disruptive pattern material (NZDPM.) Reforms in 1997 saw British-influenced modifications to the New Zealand combat uniform.

The high crowned Campaign hat, nicknamed the &quot;lemon squeezer&quot; in New Zealand, was for decades the most visible national distinction. This was adopted by the Taranaki Regiment about 1911 and became general issue for all New Zealand units during the latter stages of World War I. The different branches of service were distinguished by coloured or wide bands around the base of the crown (blue and red for artillery, green for mounted rifles, khaki and red for infantry etc.). The &quot;lemon squeezer&quot; was worn to a certain extent during World War II, although often replaced by more convenient forage caps or berets, or helmets. After being in abeyance since the 1950s, the Campaign hat was reintroduced for ceremonial wear in 1977 for Officer cadets and the New Zealand Army Band.

The M1 steel helmet was the standard combat helmet from 1960 to 2000 although the &quot;boonie hat,&quot; was common in overseas theatres, such as in the Vietnam War. New Zealand forces also used the U.S PASGT helmet until 2009 after which the Australian Enhanced Combat Helmet became the standard-issue helmet until 2019. The current combat helmet is the Viper P4 Advanced Combat Helmet by Revision Military.

In the 1990s a universal pattern mess uniform replaced various regimental and corps mess dress uniforms previously worn. The mess uniform is worn by officers and senior NCOs for formal evening occasions.

The wide-brimmed khaki slouch hat known as the Mounted Rifles Hat (MRH) with green puggaree replaced the khaki &quot;No 2&quot; British Army peaked cap as service dress headdress for all branches in 1998.

From 2002 under a &quot;one beret&quot; policy, berets of all branches of service are now universally rifle-green, with the exceptions only of the tan beret of the New Zealand Special Air Service and the blue beret of the New Zealand Defence Force Military Police.

In 2003 a desert DPM pattern, also based on the British pattern was in use with New Zealand peacekeeping forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa. NZ SAS soldiers serving in Afghanistan were issued with Australian-sourced uniforms in Crye MultiCam camouflage.

In 2008 the field uniform was updated to the modern ACU style and made in ripstop material.

In 2012 the MRH became the standard Army ceremonial headdress with the &quot;lemon squeezer&quot; being retained only for colour parties and other limited categories.

NZDPM and NZDDPM were replaced in 2013 by a single camouflage pattern and a new uniform called the New Zealand Multi Terrain Camouflage Uniform (MCU.) The shirt remains in an ACU-style however the pants are based on the Crye G3 combat pant with removable knee pads, usually otherwise associated with Special Forces and Police tactical unit assault uniforms. The MCU, with the addition of a beret or sometimes the Mounted Rifles Hat, was the working uniform for all branches and divisions of the NZ Army, and certain units within the RNZN and RNZAF. After several years in service, modifications to the uniform have since followed with a change in material to Teredo (polyester/cotton twill) for both uniform and boonie hat, a return to covered buttons, and the removal of the elbow and knee pad pockets.
In late 2020, due to shortcomings and poor performances of the MCU uniform, the MCU&#x27;s experienced issues such as the camouflage not working effectively in the New Zealand environment and poor quality of the uniform resulted in it detreating quickly from constant use. The New Zealand Army has begun replacing the MCUs with a new camouflage pattern called NZMTP, based on the British Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP), using a Multicam colour palette, produced by Crye Precision in the United States. The new uniforms will revert to the 2008 cut and be manufactured locally.

Uniform accessories such as plate carriers, webbing, belts and wet weather clothing will be purchased in MultiCam pattern to source using the current market and reduce costs.

===Rank structure and insignia===

==Equipment==
=== Infantry ===
The New Zealand Army&#x27;s primary service weapon is the Modular Assault Rifle System - Light (MARS-L) assault rifle, which is used by all service branches of the New Zealand Defence Force. The weapon can be equipped with accessories such as an ACOG sight, M203 grenade launcher or M7 bayonet. Some soldiers are equipped with the Designated Marksman Weapon (DMW), equipped with a telescopic Leupold &amp; Stevens sight allowing for increased accuracy at range. The Glock 17 is used as a sidearm.

Supporting fire is provided by FN Minimi, MAG 58 and M2 Browning machine guns, while the Barrett MRAD and Barrett M107A1 sniper rifles are used in a sniper rifle and anti-materiel rifle role. The Benelli M3 shotgun and 40mm Grenade Machine Gun (GMG) are additionally available in a supporting role.

A variety of anti-armour equipment is used, including the Javelin Medium Range Anti-Armour Weapon (MRAAW), L14A1 Medium Direct Fire Support Weapon and Short-Range Anti-Armour Weapon (M72 LAW).

=== Mortars and artillery ===
The Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery is equipped with several light mortar and artillery systems. Indirect fire is provided through the use of 60 mm and 81 mm mortar systems with the Hirtenberger M6, Hirtenberger M8 and L16A2. The British L119 light gun is operated in the artillery role.

=== Armour ===
The New Zealand Army makes use of the NZLAV wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, a variant of the Canadian LAV III. An armoured variant of the Steyr-Puch Pinzgauer is also used, although this is to be replaced by the Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle.

=== Transport and utility vehicles ===
A variety of transport and utility vehicles are used, principally including the Mercedes-Benz Unimog and its replacement, the Rheinmetall MAN RMMV HX series of military trucks. Other vehicles include the Polaris MRZR light vehicle, and the JCB High Mobility Engineer Excavator. In November 2024, the Army ordered 40 VAMTAC CK3 medium utility vehicles and 20 VAMTAC ST5 light utility vehicles to be delivered from 2027 to replace part of its Unimog and Pinzgauer fleet.

==Operational deployments==
The New Zealand Army currently has personnel deployed overseas on active service in:

* The Golan Heights (up to 8 personnel) as part of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force.
* Egypt (up to 28 personnel) as part of the Multinational Force.
* Jordan (less than 10 personnel) as part of Operation Gallant Phoenix, which is due to expire in June 2025.
* The Korean Peninsula (up to 12 personnel), in support of the United Nations Command Headquarters and Military Armistice Commission, with the mandate for this deployment due to expire in September 2026. Additional military personnel are also involved in enforcing sanctions against North Korea in the North Asia area.
* South Sudan (up to 3 personnel), as part of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, with the mandate for this deployment due to expire in September 2026.

In addition, personnel are also deployed on non-operational missions (such as providing support and training to partner nations, and gathering and analysing intelligence) in a number of locations including in Europe as part of Operation Tieke, providing support to Ukraine outside of its territory as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

=== Former ===
* Afghanistan – Mentoring at the Afghan National Army Officer Training Academy. The NZ Provincial Reconstruction Team (New Zealand) (NZ PRT), ended in April 2013.
* Iraq. Whilst New Zealand troops were not deployed as part of the original invasion of Iraq in 2003, a contingent of troops were deployed to assist with reconstruction following the invasion. Following the withdrawal of international forces from Iraq and the rise of the Islamic State in the region, New Zealand forces returned to Iraq as part of the international coalition of forces constituting Operation Inherent Resolve. The New Zealand contingent assisted in training Iraqi troops and supporting coalition efforts to strike ISIS. New Zealand withdrew once more from Iraq in 2023.
* Solomon Islands as part of the Solomon Islands International Assistance Forces supporting the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force following a period of civil unrest. This deployment ended in August 2024, with the Army&#x27;s mandate having been renewed a number of times.

== Commemorations ==
New Zealand Army Day is celebrated on 25 March, the date in 1845 when the New Zealand Legislative Council passed the first Militia Act.

ANZAC Day is the main annual commemorative activity for New Zealand soldiers. On 25 April each year the landings at Gallipoli are remembered, though the day has come to mean remembering the fallen from all wars in which New Zealand has been involved. While a New Zealand public holiday, it is a duty day for New Zealand military personnel, who, even if not involved in official commemorative activities are required to attend an ANZAC Day Dawn Parade in ceremonial uniform in their home location.

Remembrance Day, commemorating the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, is marked by official activities with a military contribution normally with parades and church services on the closest Sunday. However, ANZAC Day has a much greater profile and involves a much higher proportion of military personnel.

New Zealand Wars Day is commemorated on 28 October, this is the national day marking the 19th-century New Zealand Wars.

The various regiments of the New Zealand Army mark their own Corps Days, many of which are derived from those of the corresponding British regiments. Examples are Cambrai Day on 20 November for the Royal New Zealand Armoured Corps, St Barbara&#x27;s Day on 4 December for the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery.

<text>The 1994 [[Triple J Hottest 100]], counted down in January 1995, was a countdown of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J.

There have been 3 release versions of this compilation album. The original version&#x27;s track listing is listed below, and has been discontinued by manufacturer. The second version was a reissue by Universal released shortly after the original release. It features the same track listing as the original print. Strangely enough, the catalogue number corresponds with 2004 releases, the year when Universal began reissuing Hottest 100 CDs, despite this being released in 1995. The third version was released in 2004, this time by Warner Music. The track listing is different from the previous releases. &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;Seether&quot; have been removed, and &quot;A Certain Slant of Light&quot; was moved up to track 2 on Disc 1.

Despite being released under Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; is listed on here as just Nick Cave.

<text>Yitzhak Zuckerman (; ; 13 December 1915 – 17 June 1981), also known by his nom de guerre &quot;Antek&quot;, was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 against Nazi Germany during World War II.

==Biography==
Zuckerman was born on December 13, 1915, in Vilnius, then part of the Russian Empire. After World War I Vilnius became part of the recreated Polish state. As a young man he embraced the concepts of Socialism and Zionism. He graduated from a religious elementary school associated with the Mizrachi Zionist movement, followed by a Hebrew gymnasium in 1933. He applied to study at the University of Vilnius and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, but never began university studies.

In his youth, he became involved with the Zionist movement, as a member of HeHalutz and HeHalutz Hatzair. He lived in a Vilnius kibbutz on Subocz Street, then on a farm training pioneers in Grochów near Warsaw. In 1937, he became a member of the HeHalutz Hatzair Central Committee, and in 1938 he took over as secretary general of the Dror-Hehalutz.

After the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 he was in the area overrun by the Red Army and initially stayed in the Soviet zone of occupation, where he took an active part in the creation of various Jewish underground socialist organisations. In the spring of 1940 he moved to Warsaw, where he became one of the leaders of the Dror Hechaluc youth movement, along with his future wife Zivia Lubetkin. Zuckerman was issued a false passport by the Ładoś Group.

In 1941 he became the deputy commander of the ŻOB resistance organisation. In this capacity, he served mainly as the envoy between the commander of ŻOB and the commanders of the Polish resistance organizations of Armia Krajowa and Armia Ludowa. On 22 December 1942 he and two accomplices attacked a café in Kraków that was being used by the SS and Gestapo. Zuckerman was wounded and narrowly escaped, and his two comrades were tracked down and killed.

In 1943, he was working on the &quot;Aryan&quot; side of Warsaw to procure guns and ammunition when the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising erupted. Unable to enter the ghetto to join his comrades in battle, he nonetheless proved a crucial link between resistance forces within the ghetto and the Home Army on the &quot;Aryan&quot; side. Along with Simcha &quot;Kazik&quot; Rotem, he organized the escape of the surviving ZOB fighters through the sewers to safety. During the later Warsaw Uprising of 1944, he led a small troop of 322 survivors of the Ghetto Uprising as they fought the Germans in the ranks of the Armia Ludowa.

After the war he worked as part of the &quot;Bricha&quot; network, whose operatives smuggled Jewish refugees out of Eastern and Central Europe to Mandate Palestine. In 1947 he himself made that journey, settling in what would soon be Israel. There he and his wife Zivia, along with other veterans of the ghetto undergrounds and former partisans, were among the founding members of Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta&#x27;ot and the Ghetto Fighters&#x27; House (GFH) museum located on its grounds, commemorating those who struggled against the Nazis. GFH has a study center named for Zivia and Yitzhak Zuckerman. Zuckerman and Lubetkin settled in Lohamei HaGeta&#x27;ot and had two children, Shimon (b. 1947) and Yael (b. 1949).

In 1961 he appeared as a witness at the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Israel. He died in 1981, in the kibbutz he had founded.

A record of a lengthy interview he gave in 1976 was expanded into the book &quot;Sheva ha-Shanim ha-Hen: 1939-1946&quot; [Hebrew: Those Seven Years] published in Israel in 1991, later translated into English and published as &quot;A Surplus of Memory: Chronicle of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising&quot;.

His granddaughter Roni Zuckerman became the Israeli Air Force&#x27;s first female fighter pilot.

In 2001, the tale of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was turned into a made-for-TV film entitled &quot;Uprising&quot;, with actor David Schwimmer portraying Zuckerman.

<text>State Road 551 (SR 551), locally known as Goldenrod Road and Palmetto Avenue, forms a north–south surface street bypass of Orlando to the east.

A Central Florida Expressway Authority project known as Goldenrod Road Extension connects to SR 551 just north of SR 15 and extends it south to SR 528 (Beachline Expressway). South of this interchange, the road becomes known as Heintzelman Boulevard and ends south of Orlando International Airport. While SR 551 is maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation, the southern extension is a toll road owned and operated by the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX). A toll is required to drive only the section between State Road 528 and Hazeltine National Drive; the rest can be driven without paying.

==Route description==

The Extension begins at Cargo Road at Orlando International Airport, traveling north for 0.3 miles before an interchange with the five-ramp partial cloverleaf at State Road 528. The next 1.2 miles northward is tolled, with the barrier toll, and then the Extension intersects with Hazeltine National Drive and Lee Vista Boulevard. North of these intersections, there are median breaks for several more intersections, as the road enters a newly developed area, heading towards Hoffner Avenue (State Road 15). At Hoffner Avenue, the Extension heads towards its northern terminus at Goldenrod Road (State Road 551), continuing north as SR 551. Despite SR 551 using the older Goldenrod Road to reach Hoffner Avenue, the main route between Hoffner Avenue and Goldenrod Road is via the Extension, and so it is signed SR 551 from Hoffner Avenue.

From the south end, at Cargo Road, Heintzelman Boulevard continues south around the east side of the airport, including two tunnels under taxiways. South of the airport terminals, it curves west to meet Jeff Fuqua Boulevard, which runs from the airport south to Boggy Creek Road (CR 530) and State Road 417.

The southern extension is not assigned a state road number, but the Central Florida Expressway Authority&#x27;s website displays a shield for State Road 551 Toll. The toll currently costs $0.50 and can be paid with cash, an E-Pass or Uni transponder issued by CFX, or a SunPass transponder issued by the Florida Department of Transportation&#x27;s Florida Turnpike Enterprise. Although operated by CFX, the money collected at this toll is only used to fund the Extension and is not used for any other CFX roads; conversely, money collected elsewhere on the CFX system is not used for the Extension. Once the cost of building the road is paid off, the road will be transferred to the City of Orlando and the toll will be removed.

==History==
SR 15A was assigned on December 5, 1947 along pre-1945 State Road 287. It was defined as beginning at a point on SR 15 in Section 23, T 23 S, R 30 E and running North approximately nine miles to intersection with SR 426 in Section 2, T 22 S, R 30 E. Since then, two changes have been made: the number was changed to SR 551 in the early 1980s, and the northernmost piece was moved from Goldenrod Road to Palmetto Avenue to avoid two curves.

Construction on the southern extension began in 2001. It opened March 12, 2003, with a total cost of $38 million. The Orlando Orange County Expressway Authority, predecessor to the CFX, built the road in partnership with the City of Orlando, Orange County, the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, and several private developers in the area, in order to get it done quickly.

<text>The sclerometer, also known as the Turner-sclerometer (from meaning &quot;hard&quot;), is an instrument used by metallurgists, material scientists and mineralogists to measure the scratch hardness of materials. It was invented in 1896 by Thomas Turner (1861–1951), the first Professor of metallurgy in Britain, at the University of Birmingham.

The Turner-Sclerometer test consists of measuring the amount of load required to make a scratch.
 In test a weighted diamond point is drawn, once forward and once backward, over the smooth surface of the material to be tested. The hardness number is the weight in grams required to produce a standard scratch. The scratch selected is one which is just visible to the naked eye as a dark line on a bright reflecting surface. It is also the scratch which can just be felt with the edge of a quill when the latter is drawn over the smooth surface at right angles to a series of such scratches produced by regularly increasing weights.

<doc id="1174284" wikidata="Q2002760" url="?curid=1174284" title="NovaLogic">
<text>NovaLogic, Inc. was an American software developer and publisher established in 1985 and based in Calabasas, California. The company was founded by CEO John A. Garcia. Garcia&#x27;s background in computer software started in Southern California in the early 1980s, when he worked at Datasoft. The company was known for their Voxel Space engine, which was utilized in franchises such as the &quot;Comanche&quot; and &quot;Delta Force&quot; series. In October 2016, NovaLogic&#x27;s assets were bought out by THQ Nordic who are not currently using the label.

==History==
Originally, NovaLogic worked on new versions of previously published games. Taito America was a major client of the company and most (if not all) of NovaLogic&#x27;s earliest games were PC conversions of Taito arcade games. NovaLogic&#x27;s 1992 game &quot;Comanche: Maximum Overkill&quot; was the first release that utilized the Voxel Space engine, which allowed for larger outdoor environments and more detailed terrain. The engine was conceived by electrical engineer Kyle Freeman. Freeman&#x27;s engine stemmed from his earlier creations of medical technology. In addition, the cancelled CD-i sequel to &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, &quot;Super Mario&#x27;s Wacky Worlds&quot;, was in development by NovaLogic. Due to the failure of the Phillips CD-i platform, the project was cancelled in 1993.

&quot;Comanche: Maximum Overkill&quot; kickstarted a string of releases by NovaLogic that simulated military battles. Other games included the &quot;F-22&quot; plane simulators, &quot;Armored Fist&quot; tank simulators, and expanding the &quot;Comanche&quot; helicopter simulators. After releasing several successful military-themed games, the company started NovaLogic Systems, Inc. (NLS) on February 13, 1996. They were initially contracted by the US Army to create training simulations for the branch. In 1997, NovaLogic launched its free online matchmaking service, NovaWorld. The service allowed for large online battles and stat tracking.

In 1998, NovaLogic continued to evolve their Voxel Space engine for the inaugural game in the &quot;Delta Force&quot; series. The game was a first-person shooter set in large outdoor environments in a realistic military setting. It also featured the online NovaWorld system, which allowed for large numbers of players in a singular server. The game was well-received and it prompted the company to continue the franchise. &quot;Delta Force 2&quot; was released in 1999, followed by &quot;Delta Force: Land Warrior&quot; in 2000. The trilogy of &quot;Delta Force&quot; titles were successful in the United Kingdom as indicated by ELSPA&#x27;s chart. &quot;Delta Force&quot; peaked at #3 in February 1999, &quot;Delta Force 2&quot; peaked at #2 in February 2000, and &quot;Delta Force: Land Warrior&quot; peaked at #1 in March 2001.

NovaLogic also ventured into space combat with &quot;&quot;, featuring Bruce Campbell in the lead voice acting role. In 2001, the company released &quot;Comanche 4&quot;, the fourth and final game in the long-running series. NovaLogic, in collaboration with artist Gerald Brom, also planned to develop a PC fantasy first-person shooter entitled &quot;Necrocide: The Dead Must Die&quot; based on the &quot;Delta Force: Land Warrior&quot; engine; however, the game got cancelled in 2002.

&quot;Delta Force&quot;&#x27;s first game on consoles was released in 2002, titled &quot;Delta Force: Urban Warfare&quot; for the Sony PlayStation. It was released late in the original PlayStation&#x27;s life, in July 2002. The fourth main game in the series was released in 2003 as &quot;Delta Force: Black Hawk Down&quot;. The game was a success, and it sold over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom alone while peaking at #2 on ELSPA&#x27;s chart in April 2003. It was also the best-selling game for the month of April in the United States, peaking at #1 on NPD Techworld&#x27;s chart.

NovaLogic launched &quot;Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising&quot; in 2004, which was another first-person shooter similar to the &quot;Delta Force&quot; series, but the game had more focus on multiplayer. The company claimed to have set a world record for the &quot;largest first-person shooter game&quot;, which was quickly refuted by Sony Online Entertainment for its game &quot;PlanetSide&quot; that had routinely hosted hundreds of players on a single server. Ultimately the company settled for the title of &quot;largest modern combat first-person shooter without a subscription&quot;.

One year later, NovaLogic released &quot;Delta Force: Black Hawk Down&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox consoles, developed by Climax Group. The port allowed up to 50 players in a multiplayer game, breaking the record for the largest console multiplayer battles at the time. That same year, NovaLogic was fined $153,500 by the Business Software Alliance after an audit found they had unlicensed copies of software by Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, FileMaker, Macromedia, Microsoft, and Symantec.

NovaLogic continued their flagship franchise with the fifth main game &quot;Delta Force: Xtreme&quot; in 2005. The company had taken elements from the initial 1998 &quot;Delta Force&quot; game and recreated them in &quot;Delta Force: Xtreme&quot;, with updated graphics and gameplay. In 2008, publisher MTR Soft had displayed information about NovaLogic&#x27;s then-upcoming title &quot;Delta Force: Angel Falls&quot;. In December 2008, NovaLogic announced they had cut ties with MTR Soft, due to MTR using the license to gain additional funds. Also in 2008, NovaLogic released an alpha build of NovaWorld 2.0 that featured better performance and features. In June 2009, NovaLogic released the sixth main &quot;Delta Force&quot; game, titled &quot;Delta Force: Xtreme 2&quot;. It was released simultaneously at retail and online via digital download. The game&#x27;s engine and features were extremely similar to the previous game &quot;Delta Force: Xtreme&quot;. It became the final game in the franchise, as &quot;Delta Force: Angel Falls&quot; was never completed. &quot;Delta Force: Xtreme 2&quot; also ultimately became the final game released by NovaLogic. All titles released by the company afterwards were either compilations or re-releases.

In 2012, NovaLogic attempted to sue Activision for its usage of the &quot;Delta Force&quot; name within its game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;, alleging that the usage would confuse consumers and would also damage NovaLogic&#x27;s reputation. One year later, NovaLogic lost the case in court as the judge ruled in Activision&#x27;s favor. On October 31, 2016, it was announced that the game developer and publisher THQ Nordic had acquired all of NovaLogic&#x27;s assets, while buying out Electronic Arts&#x27; minority stake. The NovaLogic name remained dormant after the purchase; however, THQ Nordic revived the &quot;Comanche&quot; name for a new game in the franchise, with an early access release in 2020.

In August 2023, Tencent revealed a revival of the series with &quot;Delta Force: Hawk Ops&quot;. It was described as a large-scale PvP first-person shooter with cross-platform support.

<doc id="1174285" wikidata="Q3989773" url="?curid=1174285" title="The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner">
<text>The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner is the third studio album by Ben Folds Five, released on April 27, 1999. Produced by the band&#x27;s usual collaborator, Caleb Southern, it represented a departure for the band from their usual pop-rock sound to material influenced by classical and chamber music, with darker, introspective lyrics on subjects such as regret, death, and loss of innocence. The band broke up shortly after the touring period of the album, and as a result the record was considered the final release from the trio until they reunited in 2011 and released &quot;The Sound of the Life of the Mind&quot; the following year.

== Title and packaging ==
The booklet included in the CD packaging includes a section about the title, where the band states they were &quot;unaware of the existence of a living, breathing, and famous Reinhold Messner.&quot; During an interview with DJ Bruce Warren of WXPN radio shortly before the album&#x27;s release, it was revealed to the band that he was real and that he was the first person to climb Mount Everest alone, as well as one member of the first two-man team to reach the summit without the use of bottled oxygen. They further stated in the booklet that &quot;the credit goes to our cosmic collaborator on this album; coincidence.&quot;

The title of the album actually refers to a name used by the band&#x27;s drummer Darren Jessee and his friends on fake IDs as teenagers—&quot;Allegedly there were many 27 year old Reinholds who looked suspiciously adolescent, inhabiting the bars of Charlotte, North Carolina in the late eighties.&quot; This is even referenced in the lyrics of the song &quot;Regrets&quot;: &quot;Seems the police had make a computer mistake; said there must be thousands like me with the same name.&quot;

Jessee was also the source of the visual identity of the album and its singles, with photography being credited to &quot;The Jessee Archive&quot;. The album&#x27;s packaging is styled after a biography, with the cover featuring a minimalist design of a man in sunglasses and a white suit and the booklet emulating yellow, tattered pages. Combined with the title, this has led to fans and reviewers viewing the album as a fictional biography about a character named Reinhold Messner, which is supported by the very introspective lyrics featured on the album.

==Music and Lyrics==
=== Writing and recording ===
The writing style of the album has been described by the band as a reactionary process, a result of the fatigue from playing in a bombastic rock band. Bassist Robert Sledge stated in an interview with MySpace&#x27;s &quot;Front to Back&quot; that this fatigue naturally led to the band playing lighter material.

Lead singer and songwriter Ben Folds recalls being &quot;tired of writing pop songs&quot; and it led to changes in his writing style. As the new material was being written, Folds was &quot;really into&quot; chord progressions and voice leadings that he says kept finding their way into what he was writing. Naturally, the original demo for the album did not have traditional songs but rather was one long track containing all the musical ideas as a cohesive narrative. After some concerns from the label, Folds says, &quot;Everyone took me out to lunch and asked me to split it up into separate songs instead of being one, and I remember Caleb saying – kind of implying that we were sort of in trouble pretty soon because nobody was hearing anything that sounded like real songs on the record.&quot;

While split into three separate tracks on the album, the songs &quot;Hospital Song,&quot; &quot;Army,&quot; and &quot;Regrets&quot; were originally written as a multi-part suite. The ending of &quot;Hospital Song&quot; leads directly into the beginning of &quot;Army,&quot; whose final chords and lyrics are in turn used as the basis of the melody and chord progression in the verses of &quot;Regrets.&quot; In addition, the final minute of &quot;Regrets&quot; reprises the solo in &quot;Hospital Song.&quot;

The album also featured the first track where the songwriting was solely credited to the band&#x27;s drummer, Darren Jessee, in the song &quot;Magic&quot;. He contributed a demo of the song to a compilation album the year prior under the title &quot;The Magic That Holds the Sky Up from the Ground&quot; before the song was reworked into the piano trio format for the album.

The album was recorded in a three-month span. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot;, which was recorded at Folds&#x27;s house in Chapel Hill, &quot;Reinhold Messner&quot; was recorded at several recording studios. It features a notable amount of overdubs on nearly every song, such as a heavy use of string sections, french horns, and a dual horn section in the lead single &quot;Army&quot;. The album&#x27;s tracklist was nearly final, but the label requested that the album have at least one &#x27;fun song&#x27;, so the band recorded &quot;Your Redneck Past&quot; to fulfill the label&#x27;s request.

Due to the more considered approach of recording and arranging the album, the band left many songs on the cutting room floor. These songs included &quot;Break Up at Food Court&quot; and &quot;Carrying Cathy&quot;. They also recorded an unfinished, Jessee-penned song entitled &quot;Leather Jacket&quot;, which would later be contributed to a benefit album for Kosovar Refugees. Originally, &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Your Plans&quot; was preceded by a long instrumental passage; Folds credits the album&#x27;s late producer, Caleb Southern for helping edit down the song to its final product. He told an interviewer that Southern, &quot;just cut it away and then all of a sudden it was this pop song . . . I didn&#x27;t hear it like that at all, I just heard it as this little masterpiece thing.” In a Reddit AMA, he claimed Southern &quot;cut the parts he didn&#x27;t like and literally left the unwanted bits on the floor. I imagine the floor was cleaned and the recording went into the trash.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===
Both critics and the band members themselves have described &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot; as, at least in part, a loose concept album, following the Reinhold Messner character through his life, heartache, hospitalization, and childhood memories.

In an interview with WXPN, Ben described how the album originally followed a more direct concept centered around sleep. Several sleep-related songs were cut off the final tracklist, but a few remained on the final album. During the WASO Live in Perth concert, Folds describes the song &quot;Narcolepsy&quot; as &quot;about going to sleep, but it&#x27;s about the kind of going to sleep that you can&#x27;t help. I always related it to – there&#x27;s a kind of narcolepsy where you&#x27;re overstimulated in any kind of way, if you get really happy or excited or sad or whatever, you just go right to sleep; I realized that there are lots of guys out there that do this emotionally, including myself.&quot; The vocal portion of &quot;Your Most Valuable Possession&quot; consists of a message left on Folds&#x27; answering machine by his father, Dean Folds, while he was partially asleep. The album&#x27;s final song &quot;Lullabye&quot; also describes the narrator&#x27;s childhood experiences through the framing device of a lullaby, book-ending the album with songs about sleep.

On the &quot;Ben Folds iTunes Originals&quot; album, Folds explains that the song &quot;Mess&quot; is a &quot;loss of innocence song&quot; about having so much baggage that now you are unable to completely explain your history; &quot;you&#x27;ve made a mess.&quot; The song follows a breakup, possibly the one that occurs in the previous track on the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Change Your Plans&quot;, as the narrator refers to his ex&#x27;s new partner, saying &quot;he&#x27;ll never care for you more than I do&quot;. Darren Jessee described his lyrics for the song &quot;Magic&quot; as a love song written to either a good friend or a composite of several people he knew who passed away.

&quot;Your Redneck Past&quot; is an entire song that was spun off from a throwaway lyric in Army about the narrator&#x27;s redneck past. &quot;Regrets&quot; then follows up both tracks with the narrator spiraling further down into recalling memories and regrets all the way back to childhood. &quot;Hospital Song&quot;, which refers to a real hospital: Forsyth Medical Center, located on Silas Creek Parkway in Winston-Salem; features the narrator lying awake in a hospital bed, depressed at the news that the doctor just gave him, crying &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s true.&quot; In the context of the album having a loose concept, this re-contextualizes many other songs on the album as the narrator simply revisiting memories from his past before an unspecified illness takes his life.

==Reception==

The record was given generally positive reviews, with Allmusic saying that it&#x27;s the band&#x27;s willingness &quot;to forge a unique sound that makes &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot; such an interesting album to listen to. There is care to these songs and, what&#x27;s even more significant and fresh, there is also intelligence.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a B in his Consumer Guide. Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork notably gave the album a significantly more negative review than other publications, rating it a 3.3/10 and saying &quot;this trio has run out of ideas.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Speaking in 2005, six years after its release, Folds partially attributed the album to the initial break-up of Ben Folds Five, stating: &quot;We were having a really hard time before we split, the Reinhold Messner period was financially and career-wise a disaster.&quot; Folds stated in the &quot;iTunes Originals&quot; interview about the album: &quot;The &#x27;Reinhold Messner&#x27; record was – I think in a way it shows how naïve we were, and idealistic we were as a band to think that the music business would care about us extending ourselves and developing and being something different; because that record was a failure – in almost every way that you can fail. As a commercial release it didn&#x27;t sell up to anybody’s expectations, critically it got sort of lukewarm reviews; and yet, I think that was our best work. I think it&#x27;s a great record.&quot;

The band reunited to play the album in its entirety at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on September 18, 2008. This one-off concert appearance was part of the MySpace &quot;Front to Back&quot; series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band were briefly joined on stage by Ben&#x27;s father, Dean Folds, who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is used in the album song &quot;Your Most Valuable Possession&quot;. A concert film of the show was later released on the Front to Back website, which spliced in new interviews from both the band and colleagues, discussing the album and their experience with MySpace.

The lead single, &quot;Army&quot;, was featured in the Viceland comedy series &quot;Nirvanna the Band the Show&quot; as the end credits theme song.

In 2017, the album was reissued on a 180-gram vinyl. The reissue was sourced from the original mix reels and sported a new master by Kevin Gray.

<text>John Luke Porter (13 September 1813 – 4 December 1893) was a naval constructor for United States Navy and the Confederate States Navy.

== Early life ==
Porter was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1813. His mother was Frances Pritchard, daughter of Captain William Pritchard, an officer of the Revolutionary War. He had four brothers, two of whom were in shipbuilding business. Porter learned the art of shipbuilding from his father.

== United States Navy ==
In 1846 he was appointed acting constructor in United States Navy and superintended the building of the iron sloop-of-war USS &quot;Alleghany&quot; in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While in Pittsburgh he designed and submitted to the Navy Department plans and specifications for an ironclad warship, but his idea did not receive much attention in Washington. The ironclad warships were a new concept at this time and it wasn&#x27;t until 1859 until the first ironclad battleship, &quot;Gloire&quot;, was built by French Navy.

After three years at Pittburg Porter received an assignment as a regular constructor of the sloop-of-war USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, the steam sloops USS &quot;Pensacola&quot; and USS &quot;Seminole&quot;, and the steam frigates USS &quot;Powhatan&quot; and USS &quot;Colorado&quot;. Upon the secession of Florida in January 1861 Porter was stationed at Pensacola Navy Yard in Florida. He was ordered to the Washington Navy Yard and then to the Gosport Navy Yard, where he witnessed the start of the Civil War.

== Confederate States Navy ==
Although he opposed the secession of Virginia, he kept allegiance to his state and resigned from the U.S. Navy in May 1861.

Porter began working for the Confederate States Navy at the Gosport Navy Yard, at Portsmouth. He modified his previous ironclad design and submitted it to Secretary Stephen R. Mallory of the Confederate States Navy on 24 June 1861. Chief Engineer of the Navy William P. Williamson, Lt. John Mercer Brooke and Porter developed a plan of the conversion of the scuttled and burned steam frigate USS &quot;Merrimack&quot; to an ironclad, which became CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; when commissioned in February 1862. Porter had overall responsibility for the conversion, while Brooke was responsible for her iron plate and heavy ordnance and Williamson oversaw the ship&#x27;s machinery.

Sometimes after the blockade of the Confederate ports in Summer 1861, Porter was appointed Chief Constructor in the Confederate States Navy and served in that capacity until the end of the war.

After the Confederates abandoned the Norfolk area in May 1862, Porter became a Naval Constructor at Richmond, Virginia and later at Wilmington, North Carolina. He was promoted to Chief Naval Constructor in January 1864 and served in that capacity to the end of the U.S. Civil War, designing many of the South&#x27;s domestically-built warships.

== Later life ==
Following the conflict, Porter worked in civilian shipbuilding industry in Baltimore and ferry operations in Norfolk.

When Portsmouth, Virginia was first incorporated, Porter was elected president of the first City Council.

He is buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery, Portsmouth, Virginia.

<text>Resistance to Civil Government, also called On the Duty of Civil Disobedience or Civil Disobedience, is an essay by American transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, first published in 1849. In it, Thoreau argues that individuals should prioritize their conscience over compliance with unjust laws, asserting that passive submission to government authority enables injustice. Thoreau was motivated by his opposition to slavery and the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), which he viewed as morally and politically objectionable. 

The essay has had a significant impact on political thought and activism, influencing figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, who adopted its principles in the struggle for Indian independence, and Martin Luther King Jr., who cited it as a key influence during the American civil rights movement. Its themes of individual responsibility and resistance to injustice have made it a foundational text in the philosophy of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience.

==Title==
In 1848, Thoreau gave lectures at the Concord Lyceum entitled &quot;The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government&quot;. This formed the basis for his essay, which was first published under the title &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot; in an 1849 anthology by Elizabeth Peabody called &quot;Æsthetic Papers&quot;. The latter title distinguished Thoreau&#x27;s program from that of &quot;non-resistants&quot; or Christian anarchists like Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison, as Thoreau argued that their insistence on nonresistance as praxis against the state was grossly ineffectual. Nonetheless, Thoreau was initially inspired by the Christian anarchist ideals espoused by Ballou and Garrison. &quot;Resistance&quot; also served as part of Thoreau&#x27;s metaphor comparing the government to a machine: when the machine was producing injustice, it was the duty of conscientious citizens to be &quot;a counter friction&quot; (i.e., a resistance) &quot;to stop the machine&quot;.

In 1866, four years after Thoreau&#x27;s death, the essay was reprinted in a collection of Thoreau&#x27;s work (&quot;A Yankee in Canada, with Anti-Slavery and Reform Papers&quot;) under the title &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;. Today, the essay also appears under the title &quot;On the Duty of Civil Disobedience&quot;, perhaps to contrast it with William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Of the Duty of Civil Obedience&quot; to which Thoreau was in part responding. For instance, the 1960 New American Library Signet Classics edition of &quot;Walden&quot; included a version with this title. &quot;On Civil Disobedience&quot; is another common title.

The word has several definitions. The one that is intended in this case is &quot;relating to citizens and their interrelations with one another or with the state&quot;, and so &quot;civil disobedience&quot; means &quot;disobedience to the state&quot;. Sometimes people assume that &quot;civil&quot; in this case means &quot;observing accepted social forms; polite&quot; which would make &quot;civil disobedience&quot; something like &quot;polite, orderly disobedience&quot;. Although this is an acceptable dictionary definition of the word &quot;civil&quot;, it is not what is intended here. This misinterpretation is one reason the essay is sometimes considered to be an argument for pacifism or for exclusively nonviolent resistance. For instance, Mahatma Gandhi used this interpretation to suggest an equivalence between Thoreau&#x27;s civil disobedience and his own satyagraha.

==Background==
The slavery crisis inflamed New England in the 1840s and 1850s. The environment became especially tense after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. A lifelong abolitionist, Thoreau delivered an impassioned speech which would later become &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; in 1848, just months after leaving Walden Pond. The speech dealt with slavery and at the same time excoriated American imperialism, particularly the Mexican–American War.

== Summary ==
Thoreau asserts that because governments are typically more harmful than helpful, they therefore cannot be justified. Democracy is no cure for this, as majorities simply by virtue of being majorities do not also gain the virtues of wisdom and justice. The judgment of an individual&#x27;s conscience is not necessarily inferior to the decisions of a political body or majority, and so &quot;[i]t is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right... Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice.&quot; He adds, &quot;I cannot for an instant recognize as my government [that] which is the slave&#x27;s government also.&quot;

The government, according to Thoreau, is not just a little corrupt or unjust in the course of doing its otherwise-important work, but in fact the government is primarily an agent of corruption and injustice. Because of this, it is &quot;not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize&quot;.

Political philosophers have counseled caution about revolution because the upheaval of revolution typically causes a great deal of expense and suffering. Thoreau contends that such a cost/benefit analysis is inappropriate when the government is actively facilitating an injustice as extreme as slavery. Such a fundamental immorality justifies any difficulty or expense to bring it to an end. &quot;This people must cease to hold slaves, and to make war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.&quot;

Thoreau tells his audience that they cannot blame this problem solely on pro-slavery Southern politicians, but must put the blame on those in, for instance, Massachusetts, &quot;who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to Mexico, &quot;cost what it may&quot;... There are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them.&quot; (See also: Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Slavery in Massachusetts&quot; which also advances this argument.)

He exhorts people not to just wait passively for an opportunity to &quot;vote&quot; for justice, because voting for justice is as ineffective as &quot;wishing&quot; for justice; what you need to do is to actually &quot;be just&quot;. This is not to say that you have an obligation to devote your life to fighting for justice, but you &quot;do&quot; have an obligation not to commit injustice and not to give injustice your practical support.

Paying taxes is one way in which otherwise well-meaning people collaborate in injustice. People who proclaim that the war in Mexico is wrong and that it is wrong to enforce slavery contradict themselves if they fund both things by paying taxes. Thoreau points out that the same people who applaud soldiers for refusing to fight an unjust war are not themselves willing to refuse to fund the government that started the war.

In a constitutional republic like the United States, people often think that the proper response to an unjust law is to try to use the political process to change the law, but to obey and respect the law until it is changed. But if the law is itself clearly unjust, and the lawmaking process is not designed to quickly obliterate such unjust laws, then Thoreau says the law deserves no respect and it should be broken. In the case of the United States, the Constitution itself enshrines the institution of slavery, and therefore falls under this condemnation. Abolitionists, in Thoreau&#x27;s opinion, should completely withdraw their support of the government and stop paying taxes, even if this means courting imprisonment, or even violence.

Because the government will retaliate, Thoreau says he prefers living simply because he therefore has less to lose. &quot;I can afford to refuse allegiance to Massachusetts... It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the State than it would to obey. I should feel as if I were worth less in that case.&quot;
He was briefly imprisoned for refusing to pay the poll tax, but even in jail felt freer than the people outside. He considered it an interesting experience and came out of it with a new perspective on his relationship to the government and its citizens. (He was released the next day when &quot;someone interfered, and paid that tax&quot;.)

Thoreau said he was willing to pay the highway tax, which went to pay for something of benefit to his neighbors, but that he was opposed to taxes that went to support the government itself—even if he could not tell if his particular contribution would eventually be spent on an unjust project or a beneficial one. &quot;I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually.&quot;

Because government is man-made, not an element of nature or an act of God, Thoreau hoped that its makers could be reasoned with. As governments go, he felt, the U.S. government, with all its faults, was not the worst and even had some admirable qualities. But he felt we could and should insist on better. &quot;The progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a progress toward a true respect for the individual... Is a democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in government? Is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.&quot;

An aphorism often erroneously attributed to Thomas Jefferson, &quot;That government is best which governs least...&quot;, was actually found in Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Civil Disobedience.&quot; Thoreau was apparently paraphrasing the motto of &quot;The United States Magazine and Democratic Review&quot;: &quot;The best government is that which governs least&quot; which might also be inspired from the 17th verse of the Tao Te Ching by Laozi: &quot;The best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects.&quot; Thoreau expanded it significantly:

== Influence ==

===Mahatma Gandhi===
Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi was impressed by Thoreau&#x27;s arguments. In 1907, about one year into his first &quot;satyagraha&quot; campaign in South Africa, he wrote a translated synopsis of Thoreau&#x27;s argument for &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, credited Thoreau&#x27;s essay with being &quot;the chief cause of the abolition of slavery in America&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Both his example and writings are at present exactly applicable to the Indians in the Transvaal.&quot; He later concluded:
===Martin Luther King Jr.===
American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was also influenced by this essay. In his autobiography, he wrote:
===Martin Buber===
Existentialist Martin Buber wrote, of &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;

===Others===
Author Leo Tolstoy cited &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; as having a strong impact on his nonviolence methodology. Others who are said to have been influenced by &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; include: Suffragist Alice Paul, President John F. Kennedy, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, and various writers such as, Marcel Proust, Ernest Hemingway, Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, and William Butler Yeats.

<doc id="1174298" wikidata="Q664687" url="?curid=1174298" title="Bissagos Islands">
<text>The Bissagos Islands, also spelled Bijagós (), are a group of about 88 islands and islets located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Guinea-Bissau.

==Geography==
The archipelago was formed from the ancient delta of the Geba and Grande de Buba rivers and spans an area of . Twenty of its islands are populated year-round, including the most populated island, Bubaque. The administrative capital, Bolama is situated on the island of Bolama.

===Environment===
There is a high diversity of ecosystems: mangroves with intertidal zones, palm forests, dry and semi-dry forests, secondary and degraded forests, coastal savanna, sand banks and aquatic zones. The archipelago was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1996. The site has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because its intertidal mudflats and mangroves support significant populations of non-breeding and wintering waterbirds, especially large numbers of migratory Palaearctic waders, gulls and terns, as well as greater flamingos and pink-backed pelicans.

===Demographics===
The population is estimated at 30,000 (2006) and the ethnic group Bissago pp) () predominates. It has a relatively youthful population due to high birth rates and low life expectancy.0

==Economy==
The economy is largely rural, with many families living from subsistence farming and fishing. There is some tourist activity, mostly boat charters from neighboring Senegal. Lack of infrastructure and communication links prevent the development of the islands&#x27; tourism potential. Starting in the early 2000s, several of the islands began to be used as transit depots for narcotraffic, which is quickly changing the social and economic fabric of the islands.

==History==
In pre-European colonial times, the islands were central to the trade along the coast of West Africa and they built up a powerful navy. In 1532, King Joao III of Portugal ceded a nominal right to the islands to his brother Luis, Duke of Beja as well as generous trading rights. In 1535, Dom Luis sent a force to conquer the islands, but the islanders&#x27; strong navy destroyed it, leaving few survivors. For years afterwards the Bissagos refused to trade with the Portuguese and treated any shipwrecked sailors harshly, until relations were restored around 1550. The Bissago islanders then became important providers of slaves to the Portuguese, putting aside inter-island rivalries to raid the mainland.

In 1849, with the people of the Bissagos still fiercely independent, the British and French mounted a joint expedition to &#x27;pacify&#x27; the islands, but they were repulsed. The Portuguese tried several times to put down &#x27;tax revolts&#x27; in the islands in the early 20th century but largely failed. The islands were not formally annexed by Portugal until 1936.

The Bissagos were visited by Austrian anthropologist and photographer Hugo Bernatzik in 1930–1931, who documented daily life among the Bidyogo people.

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is conducting research into infectious diseases on the islands. Because they are so isolated there is less danger of contamination of the results than in other places.

==Culture==
Due to difficulties of communication with mainland Guinea-Bissau that persist to this day, the population has a considerable degree of autonomy and has shielded its ancestral culture from outside influence. The Bijago language is spoken along with Portuguese and creole.

Some authors argue that Bijago culture tends to be matriarchal, with women managing the household, the economy, law, as well as initiating courtship (women choose their husbands and terminate the matrimony). Other sources dispute this and suggest that closer examination has revealed a fundamentally patriarchal society where women, in spite of their substantial participation in material production and important roles in social, political, and religious matter, remain essentially unequal to men. A 2016 study suggested that female status in Bijagos society was diminished during the slave trade era (likely due to European influence) but has become more valued again in more recent times.

In 2012, a study by Bissau-Guinean sociologist Boaventura Santy examined the social representations of the people of the island of Formosa Bijagó about possible threats from climate change. The study concluded that for &quot;the Bijagó the natural and the social are inextricably linked, to the extent that a crisis in the social system would have negative effects&quot; on the natural system. In particular, it was the lack of harmony between the community, ancestors and the supernatural world that was seen as causing environmental dissonance.

===Art===

The Bissagos peoples produce many artifacts for daily use and ritual following a traditional iconography that is unique to their culture, and shows variations from island to island. Among the most striking Bidyogo art pieces are the portable ancestor shrines (&quot;iran&quot;) and the zoomorphic masks representing cows (&quot;vaca-bruta&quot;), sharks, stingrays and, occasionally, other local animals. Traditionally-decorated artifacts are also produced for &quot;fanado&quot; coming-of-age ceremonies (wood masks, spears, shields, headgear, bracelets), daily activities (fishing, agriculture) and personal use (stools, basketry, foodware). Its unique aesthetics make Bidyogo art easily distinctive from other African tribal arts.

<text>Sir Arthur Roden Cutler, (24 May 1916 – 21 February 2002) was an Australian diplomat, the longest-serving Governor of New South Wales and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth armed forces.

==Early life==
Arthur Roden Cutler was born on 24 May 1916. His cousin, Sir Charles Cutler, was Deputy Premier of New South Wales from 1965 to 1975. Arthur grew up in the Sydney Harbour suburb of Manly, where he attended the Manly Village Public School. At the age of 15, he enrolled at Sydney Boys High School.

After school, Cutler worked for the Texas Company Australasia, which later became Texaco. He studied economics during the night at the University of Sydney and joined the Sydney University Regiment in 1936.

On 10 November 1939, Cutler was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Sydney University Regiment. He enjoyed all sports, especially riding, rifle shooting and water polo, and was awarded a University Blue in swimming. As an 18-year-old lifesaver, he swam to the aid of a surfer who was being circled by a large shark. The shark brushed him twice as he helped the surfer to the beach.

In May 1940, Cutler volunteered for overseas service with the Second Australian Imperial Force, receiving a commission in the 2/5th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, 7th Division.

==Military service==
In 1941, Cutler served with the 2/5th in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. During the period between 19 June and 6 July, in the Merdjayoun-Damour area of Syria, and as part of the Battle of Merdjayoun, Lieutenant Cutler&#x27;s exploits included repairing a telephone line under heavy fire, repulsing enemy tank attacks, setting up an outpost to bring fire to a road used by the enemy and, with a 25-pound field gun, demolishing a post threatening the Australian advance. Later, during the Battle of Damour, he was seriously wounded and, when rescued 26 hours later, his leg had to be amputated. Cutler received the Victoria Cross for his actions in the Merdjayoun-Damour area, and was medically discharged in 1942.

===VC citation===
&quot;War Office, 28 November 1941.&quot;

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the VICTORIA CROSS to the under-mentioned:—

Lieutenant Arthur Roden Cutler (NX.12378), Australian Military Forces.

For most conspicuous and sustained gallantry during the Syrian Campaign and for outstanding bravery during the bitter fighting at Merdjayoun when this artillery officer became a byword amongst the forward troops with whom he worked.

At Merdjayoun on the 19 June 1941 our infantry attack was checked after suffering heavy casualties from an enemy counter attack with tanks. Enemy machine gun fire swept the ground but Lieutenant Cutler with another artillery officer and a small party pushed on ahead of the infantry and established an outpost in a house. The telephone line was cut and he went out and mended this line under machine gun fire and returned to the house, from which enemy posts and a battery were successfully engaged.

The enemy then attacked this outpost with infantry and tanks, killing the Bren gunner and mortally wounding the other officer. Lieutenant Cutler and another manned the anti-tank rifle and Bren gun and fought back driving the enemy infantry away. The tanks continued the attack, but under constant fire from the anti-tank rifle and Bren gun eventually withdrew. Lieutenant Cutler then personally supervised the evacuation of the wounded members of his party. Undaunted he pressed for a further advance. He had been ordered to establish an outpost from which he could register the only road by which the enemy transport could enter the town. With a small party of volunteers he pressed on until finally with one other he succeeded in establishing an outpost right in the town, which was occupied by the Foreign Legion, despite enemy machine gun fire which prevented our infantry from advancing.

At this time Lieutenant Cutler knew the enemy were massing on his left for a counter attack and that he was in danger of being cut off. Nevertheless he carried out his task of registering the battery on the road and engaging enemy posts. The enemy counter attacked with infantry and tanks and he was cut off. He was forced to go to ground, but after dark succeeded in making his way through the enemy lines. His work in registering the only road by which enemy transport could enter the town was of vital importance and a big factor in the enemy&#x27;s subsequent retreat.

On the night of 23–24 June he was in charge of a 25-pounder sent forward into our forward defended localities to silence an enemy anti-tank gun and post which had held up our attack. This he did and next morning the recapture of Merdjayoun was completed.

Later at Damour on 6 July when our forward infantry were pinned to the ground by
heavy hostile machine gun fire Lieutenant Cutler, regardless of all danger, went to bring a line to his outpost when he was seriously wounded. Twenty-six hours elapsed before it was possible to rescue this officer, whose wound by this time had become septic necessitating the amputation of his leg.

Throughout the Campaign this officer&#x27;s courage was unparalleled and his work was a big factor in the recapture of Merdjayoun. &quot;London Gazette&quot;

==Diplomatic and vice-regal career==

Following the war, Cutler began a long career in the Australian diplomatic service. At the age of 29 he was appointed High Commissioner to New Zealand (1946–52). Other postings within the Commonwealth followed; he served in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) (1952–55) and was the Australian Minister in Egypt during the Suez Crisis in 1956. As a result of his service in Egypt, Cutler was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1957 New Years Honours.

Cutler acted as Secretary-General of the South-East Asia Council of Ministers meeting in Canberra in January 1957 and became Chief of Protocol of the Department of External Affairs (1957–58). Cutler was also State President of the Returned Services League in 1958. He was Australian High Commissioner in Pakistan, (1958–61), and Australian Consul-General in New York, (1961–65), during which period he was the Australian delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in 1962, 1963 and 1964 and was the Australian Representative to independence of the Republic of Somalia in 1960.

For his diplomatic services to Australia, Cutler was honoured by The Queen as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in December 1965. He was further honoured as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1970. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK) in 1981.

His final diplomatic posting, in 1965, as Ambassador to the Netherlands, was cut short in 1966 when he returned home as Governor of New South Wales, an office he served for a record 15 years, through four Premiers, and a change of government after eleven years of conservative rule. Such was his popularity that the Labor Premier, Neville Wran, extended his last term until 1981.

As the longest-serving state governor, Cutler occasionally acted as Administrator of the Commonwealth of Australia in the absence of the Governor-General. He acted as Administrator during Sir John Kerr&#x27;s term from 20 February – 13 March 1975, 12–24 May 1975, 16–17 September 1975, 23 December 1975 – 3 February 1976, 26 April – 14 June 1977 and finally 23–28 August 1977. Cutler was also scheduled to act during November 1975, when Kerr had planned an overseas holiday. However, in view of the developing situation in Canberra, Kerr cancelled his travel bookings. In 1975, Cutler&#x27;s advice to Kerr that he should warn Prime Minister Gough Whitlam of his impending dismissal, was ignored. Cutler later said that, had he been Administrator at the time, he would certainly have accepted his prime minister&#x27;s advice and he would have allowed the parliament to resolve the issue without recourse to any such drastic action as dismissal.

==Later life==

Following the end of his term as governor, Cutler was given various chairmanships and business appointments, including as chairman of Ansett Express (1981–92) and the State Bank of New South Wales (1981–86). Throughout the republican debate and referendum he remained a staunch monarchist and proud Australian, believing the monarchy brought stability, continuity and tradition to his country. He co-operated with the popular Australian novelist Colleen McCullough on a biography, &quot;Roden Cutler, VC&quot;, which appeared in 1998. 

Cutler died on 22 February 2002 following a long illness. He was accorded the rare honour of a State Funeral on 28 February 2002 by the New South Wales Government.

==Legacy==
In 1968, the first in a new class of Sydney Harbour ferries was named the &quot;Lady Cutler&quot;.

A 19-storey commercial/office building completed in 1975 at 24 Campbell Street, Sydney, was named in his honour.

The highway interchange between three motorways at Casula in south-west Sydney is named in his honour as the Sir Roden Cutler VC Memorial Interchange.

===Sir Roden &amp; Lady Cutler Foundation===

The Sir Roden &amp; Lady Cutler Foundation helps the elderly and physically handicapped to be mobile and also with transport to and from their medical appointments. Many people have contributed to this cause, notably Cutler&#x27;s former high school, Sydney Boys High, and his primary school, Manly Village, which also dedicated memorials to Cutler on the 90th anniversary of his birth.

==Personal life==
Cutler married Helen Morris on 28 May 1946. They had four sons. She died on 8 November 1990 at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

Cutler remarried in 1993 to Joan Goodwin.

<text>Troy Michael Dayak (born January 29, 1971) is an American former soccer player who played as central defender. He spent his entire Major League Soccer career with the San Jose Clash/Earthquakes and nearly all of his professional career playing for Bay Area teams.

== Club career ==

=== San Francisco Bay Blackhawks ===

Dayak (nicknamed &quot;Cowboy&quot;) grew up in Walnut Creek, California and attended Livermore High School. In 1989, he attended the University of San Francisco for one year and then signed with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the Western Soccer League (WSL). Seventeen years old at the time, he was the youngest player to sign with the WSL or its successor leagues, the APSL and A-League. In 1990, the WSL merged with the American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). In 1991, the Blackhawks won the APSL championship and Dayak was named a first team All Star. In 1993, the Blackhawks owner moved the team to the lower division USISL and renamed the team the San Jose Hawks. Despite going to the 1993 Sizzlin&#x27; Six tournament, the team folded at the end of the season.

=== Indoor soccer ===

In 1993, Troy signed with the Cleveland Crunch of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), helping lead them to the 1993–1994 NPSL title. In 1995, he signed with the San Jose Grizzlies of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL).

=== MLS ===

In 1996, he was selected by MetroStars in second round of the Inaugural MLS Draft (19th overall). Troy, who had strong roots in the San Francisco Bay Area, refused to sign with the league and move his family to the New York area. Therefore, he was traded by the MetroStars to the San Jose Clash (later to be named the Earthquakes) in exchange for Rhett Harty and first round pick in 1996 College Draft. He was a solid starter for the Clash until, in August 1997, he suffered a violent collision snapping his head backwards. Troy&#x27;s neck was already aggravated due to two previous neck injuries, and he was very close to becoming paralyzed. Troy was told that he would never play again. Nonetheless, in October 1997, he underwent surgery that fused a piece of bone from Troy&#x27;s hip onto his 5th and 6th vertebrae. After a long march to recovery, he rejoined the Clash in 1998, going on loan to the San Francisco Bay Seals for one game, only to be waived at the end of the season. In 1999 Dayak signed with the San Francisco Bay Seals of the A-League. Early in the 1999 season, Dayak suffered a major knee injury damaging his medial collateral ligament (MCF) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). After a difficult recovery complicated by infection, Troy rejoined the Seals for the 2000 campaign as a player and coach. He was honored that season when he made the A League all stars. In 2001 Troy was signed by Frank Yallop, new head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes. When not suffering from a multitude of injuries (upper back sprain, shoulder sprain, neck sprain, abdominal strain, sports hernia, food poisoning), Troy has been a solid starter for the Quakes, helping lead the team to two MLS Cups in 2001 and 2003. Dayak earned the MLS Comeback Player of the Year Award in 2001. Dayak has scored eight goals and added seven assists in his seven years in the league.

<doc id="1174308" wikidata="Q2915959" url="?curid=1174308" title="Disney's River Country">
<text>Disney&#x27;s River Country was the first water park at Walt Disney World Resort, Florida. River Country, located along the shores of Bay Lake and near Disney&#x27;s Fort Wilderness Resort &amp; Campground, was themed as a rustic, old-fashioned swimming hole. Opening on June 20, 1976, the park closed indefinitely on November 2, 2001. On January 20, 2005, after roughly three years of closure, The Walt Disney Company announced that the park would remain closed, permanently.

==History==

Positioned on the shore of Bay Lake, near Discovery Island, the park featured a rustic-wilderness theme, complete with lush landscaping, large rocks and man-made boulders. It was described as an &quot;old-fashioned swimming hole&quot;. The original working title was &quot;Pop&#x27;s Willow Grove&quot;.

The park was featured in a musical number from the 1977 &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; episode &quot;The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World&quot;, which included a song titled &quot;River Country&quot;, featuring the then-Mouseketeer lineup from the late 70s incarnation of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; enjoying its attractions.

The park featured mostly sandy ground (instead of pavement), several lakeside, sandy beaches with lawn chairs and daybeds, and a unique water-filtering system using confluent water from the adjacent Bay Lake (which was dammed-off), creating a natural-looking, albeit artificial, freshwater lagoon. The park&#x27;s water was at a higher level than the lake&#x27;s, which was an effort to prevent lake water from going into the park.

There were several deaths that took place at River Country. The first was of an 11-year-old boy who contracted amoebic meningoencephalitis, an amoebic infection of the brain, from the water in 1980. Park officials noted that similar amoebic infections also occurred relatively frequently elsewhere, and said it was an inherent problem with freshwater lakes in warm weather and thus could not be blamed on the park&#x27;s water system. Three other children had died in similarly questionable situations, in Florida, in the same month. The other two deaths were from drowning, in 1982 and 1989.

===Closure===
In 1989, Disney opened a second themed water park, Typhoon Lagoon; it had more parking, slides, amenities, and was significantly larger. Six years later, in 1995, Disney opened a third themed water park, Blizzard Beach, which was bigger than both and featured more thrilling attractions.
The themed water park closed on November 2, 2001, with the expectation that it would reopen in the spring of 2002. On April 11, 2002, the Orlando Sentinel reported that &quot;Walt Disney World&#x27;s first water park, River Country, has closed and may not reopen&quot; and that Disney World spokesman Bill Warren stated &quot;River Country could be reopened if there&#x27;s enough guest demand&quot;.
In 2005, Disney officially announced that River Country would remain closed permanently, and removed the entrance water tower. For the next 17 years, River Country sat abandoned, rotting and gradually being reclaimed by nature.

During this time, the water park was fenced off with signs up reading &quot;Sorry, River Country is closed.&quot; The park was a popular site amongst urban explorers who climbed over the green fence or walked in through the backstage driveway. The River Country Closing Theme still played in the abandoned park, while the lights automatically turned off and on; since Disney did not cut off the power to the water park.

The closure made River Country the second (of only two) Disney park in the company&#x27;s history to close its doors permanently, with nearby Discovery Island on the lake closing previously, in 1999.

On August 25, 2016, Disney announced that it would drain and fill in Upstream Plunge, the 330,000-gallon pool, though there were no immediate plans to tear down any other part of the park.

====Demolition &amp; cancelled replacement hotel====
On March 5, 2018, Disney filed permits for a new mystery development labeled &quot;Project 89&quot; to be built along Bay Lake and over the former River Country site. A week later, it was rumored that &quot;Project 89&quot; would most likely be another themed Hotel Resort or DVC timeshare property.

The resort hotel was confirmed on May 31, 2018, and most remaining structures at the park, including the remnants of the Upstream Plunge pool, were demolished on April 20, 2019, to make way for the development of the new hotel. Disney later officially announced that the new deluxe resort would be nature-themed and called &quot;Reflections – A Disney Lakeside Lodge.&quot; The new resort was slated to have 900 hotel rooms and was set to open in 2022. The new hotel would also feature several Disney characters for each of the rooms including &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot;, and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; among others. A lakeside restaurant featuring the characters from &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; was also slated to open along with the new resort in 2022.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Walt Disney Parks division halted all major construction on the Walt Disney World Resort property, including Reflections – A Disney Lakeside Lodge. On March 15, 2022, Disney announced that the project was scrapped for a Disney Vacation Club tower at the site.
 However, on November 26, 2024, Disney Vacation Club announced that change the name of Reflections – A Disney Lakeside Lodge into Disney Lakeshore Lodge, which will be opening in 2027 at Walt Disney World Resort.

==List of attractions==
Attractions included:

*&quot;Upstream Plunge&quot;, a lung shaped clean-water pool.

<doc id="1174311" wikidata="Q2432374" url="?curid=1174311" title="Florida State Road 15A">
<text>State Road 15A (SR 15A) is part of the Florida State Road System, and a suffixed alternate of State Road 15. Along with its parent route, SR 15A is signed north–south.

==Route description==
SR 15A begins at the intersection of US 17/92 (SR 15/600; South Woodland Boulevard) as a western continuation of East Taylor Road, which from there runs east to CR 4101. It forms a western truck bypass for the aforementioned routes around DeLand, and begins to curve to the northwest just before the intersection with South Adelle Avenue while West Taylor Road resumes in a realigned road just south of the intersection with SR 15A and South Adelle, which returns to the original trajectory that SR 15A replaced. North of the intersection with West Beresford Avenue it becomes part of South Spring Garden Boulevard. Along the way, the otherwise minor intersection with Camphor Lane leads to the NRHP-listed John B. Stetson House. The sole intersection with a state route along this road, other than those at the termini is Florida State Road 44 (West New York Avenue), and South Spring Garden Boulevard becomes North Spring Garden Boulevard. Additionally, SR 15A becomes not only a truck bypass for US 17 and 92, but for SR 44 north of this point. Along the way, North Spring Garden Boulevard encounters a grade crossing with CSX DeLand Spur, and former industrial areas can be found in the vicinity of the crossing between Wisconsin and Minnesota Avenues, primarily along the east side.

North of Plymouth Avenue, the road changes from a four-lane undivided highway to a four-lane divided one. The truck bypasses for US 92 and SR 44 along SR 15A end at the intersection of Volusia County Road 92 (International Speedway Boulevard), across the street from Grantham Way, the latter of which is the entrance to the Glenwood Springs residential community. VCR 92 connects to motorists and truck drivers the northern end of the US 17/92 overlap. North of that intersection, SR 15A leaves the city limits and runs through semi-rural surroundings in unincorporated segments of Volusia County. The only signalized intersection in this vicinity is with Glenwood Road (Volusia County Road 4088), an unmarked west to east county road that leaves its community namesake immediately west of the intersection with SR 15A, and has an eastern terminus at the fork in the road with US 17 and SR 11. The last intersection before the route&#x27;s northern terminus is two streets obstructed by the divider; Tall Oaks Road leading from the southbound lanes and Williamsbridge Road leading from the northbound lanes. After this SR 15A curves to the northeast and terminates at US 17/FL 15 (North Woodland Boulevard), north of DeLand. It continues northeast from its northern end as CR 15A to SR 11.

==Major intersections==


==History==
SR 15A used to include CR 15A, which continues the bypass to SR 11. It also used to include SR 472.

===Former sections===
Several former sections of SR 15A have existed throughout the state within the vicinity of SR 15. These include &quot;SR 139 (Kings Highway)&quot; heading northwest out of downtown Jacksonville as a hidden route for U.S. Route 23, &quot;SR 551 (Goldenrod Road)&quot; east of Orlando, and &quot;SR 729 (State Market Road)&quot; in Pahokee.

One notable section was from US 17 Roosevelt Boulevard on US 17 Alt Roosevelt Expressway until ending on eastbound Interstate 10 (SR 8). With the realignment of US 17 onto the Roosevelt Expressway, that segment became part of SR 15.

Other sections of SR 15A have existed:
* SR 15A, now CR 15A, connected SR 15/SR 700 (US 98/US 441) at Upthegrove Beach to SR 710. At the same time, SR 15B (now CR 15B) connected the same two highways near the Okeechobee-Martin County boundary line about to the southeast.
* SR 15A, now CR 15A, connected SR 15 (US 17) south of Green Cove Springs to SR 16 west of Green Cove Springs.
* Several short sections of SR 15A spurred from SR 15 (US 17) in and near Orange Park. Some or all may now be CR 15A.
* SR 15A, now CR 15A, connected SR 15 (US 1-23) southeast of downtown Callahan to SR 200 (U.S. Route 301) southwest of downtown Callahan.

==Historic State Road 15C==
In addition to the former SR 15B noted above, Okeechobee County also had a State Road 15C. Now CR 15C, it was, and still is, an eastward spur from SR 15 near Fort Drum.

<text>The , also known as , is a Japanese intelligence agency under the Cabinet Secretariat responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information for the cabinet. As a principal member of the Japanese intelligence community, the CIRO reports directly to the Prime Minister. Its operations are mandated through the Cabinet Law.

The agency is said to be equivalent to the American Central Intelligence Agency. Like most intelligence agencies in Japan, its personnel are usually recruited from other agencies. Around 100 out of 170 CIRO agents are from other agencies/ministries with top positions occupied by career police officers. The CIRO frequently works with the National Security Council as a communication channel to the prime minister. 

The CIRO is headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, in a building called &quot;H20&quot;.

==History==
The CIRO was created by the Allied Forces through the formation of the in April 1952 with Jun Murai as the first director in an attempt to replicate its structure after the CIA. But due to widespread opposition and the factionalism in the bureaucracy, this plan was discarded. The RO was placed under jurisdiction of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office in 1957 and was known as the . The CRO was later renamed as the CIRO in 1986.

The Cabinet Intensive Information Center was established on April 11, 1996 to ensure that the CIRO can inform the Prime Minister in case of severe emergencies. It&#x27;s located in the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence.

In August 2007, discussions of intelligence reforms through the paper &quot;Improvement of Counter-Intelligence Functions&quot; resulted in the establishment of the Counterintelligence Center. It&#x27;s been suggested that the CIC can be used as the basis for the creation of an actual external intelligence agency similar to the CIA.

In 2013, CIRO satellite imagery analysis was used to assist NGOs in Tacloban for reconstruction work in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan.

Since 2015, CIRO agents are usually recruited to be sent to the International Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Collection Unit.

In 2016, the business magazine Facta reported that the government of Shinzo Abe had directed the CIRO to spy on a legal council connected to David Kaye, who as U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of expression stated &quot;deep and genuine concern&quot; on declining media independence in Japan.

On January 12, 2024, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center announced that the launch of the Optical-8 satellite was a success, which separated from the missile and has entered orbit.

===Spy scandal===
On January 17, 2008, an official of Naichō was charged for spying for Russians, passing them classified information. The Russians denied the claim. Since then, there had been calls for greater accountability on Naichō.

== Organization ==
According to its official web site, the organization of Naichō is as follows:

<text>Science by press conference or science by press release is the practice by which scientists put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the news media via press conferences or press releases. The term is usually used disparagingly, to suggest that the seekers of publicity are promoting claims of questionable scientific merit, using the media for attention as they are unlikely to win the approval of the scientific community.

Premature publicity violates a cultural value of most of the scientific community, which is that findings should be subjected to independent review with a &quot;thorough examination by the scientific community&quot; before they are widely publicized. The standard practice is to publish a paper in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. This idea has many merits, including that the scientific community has a responsibility to conduct itself in a deliberative, non-attention seeking way; and that its members should be oriented more towards the pursuit of insight than fame. Science by press conference in its most egregious forms can be undertaken on behalf of an individual researcher seeking fame, a corporation seeking to sway public opinion or investor perception, or a political or ideological movement.

== Etymology ==

The phrase was coined by Spyros Andreopoulos, a public affairs officer at Stanford University Medical School, in a 1980 letter which appeared in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;. Andreopoulos was commenting specifically on the publicity practices of biotechnology startups, including Biogen and Genentech. The journal in which it appeared had implemented a long-standing policy under editor Franz J. Ingelfinger which prohibited seeking publicity for research prior to its submission or publication, informally called the Ingelfinger Rule.

== Notable examples ==
* In 1989, chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann held a press conference to claim they had successfully achieved cold fusion. (Highlighting the complexity of defining the term, Pons and Fleischman technically had an accepted paper in press at a peer-reviewed journal at the time of their press conference, though that was not widely acknowledged at the time, and the quality of the paper and its review were later criticized.)
* In 1998, Andrew Wakefield held a press conference to claim that the MMR vaccine caused autism. In January 2011, an article by Brian Deer and its accompanying editorial in &quot;BMJ&quot; identified Wakefield&#x27;s work as an &quot;elaborate fraud&quot;.
* In 2002, a group called Clonaid held a press conference to announce they had successfully achieved human cloning.
* In 2005, the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences (ERF) reported their findings from testing aspartame on rats. Their studies were widely criticized and later discounted.
* In September 2012, Gilles-Éric Séralini held a press conference to claim that genetically modified food caused terrible cancers in rats, on the eve of the publication of a scientific paper, a book publication, and a movie release, and in the runup to the vote on California Proposition 37, a GM food-labeling initiative. As the Séralini affair unfolded, it was revealed that Séralini required journalists to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive pre-prints of the paper, to prevent them from discussing the paper with independent scientists. The scientific paper was retracted in 2013.

These cases became notorious examples of &quot;science by press conference&quot; precisely because they were widely reported in the press, but were later rebuffed, debunked, or found to be outright fraud.

== Motivations ==
Competition for publicity, between scientific institutions or just individual researchers, is considered a driving force behind premature press conferences. Pressure to announce research findings quickly enough to &quot;avoid losing credit&quot; for any scientific advances may be enhanced by limited or highly competitive funding.

Science by press conference does not have to involve a groundbreaking announcement. A manufacturer may desire to publicize results of research that suggest their product is safe. Science by press conference does not necessarily have to be directed at the general public. In some cases, it may be directed at a target market such as opinion leaders, a specific industry, potential investors, or a specific group of consumers. Biotechnology companies, for example, have financial incentives to utilize premature press conferences to gain favorable media coverage.

In recent years, sociologists of science have recast discussion about &quot;science by press conference&quot;. They point to the increasing presence of media conversation across all aspects of culture, and argue that science is subject to many of the same social forces as other aspects of culture. They have described the increased &quot;medialization&quot; of science, and suggest that both science and society are changed by this process.

== Responsibility ==

While the phrase tends to criticize scientists involved in creating the publicity, it has also been used to assert that the media bear responsibility in many instances. Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists&#x27; difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media&#x27;s interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent &quot;groundbreaking findings&quot; rather than on the larger context of a research field. Further, when results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, basic journalism skills require skepticism and further investigation, the frequent lack of which can be seen as a problem with the media as much as with scientists who seek to exploit their power.

Common examples of science by press conference are media reports that a certain product or activity affects health or safety. For instance, the media frequently report findings that a certain food causes or prevents a disease. These reports sometimes contradict earlier reports. In some cases, it is later learned that a group interested in influencing opinion had a hand in publicizing a specific report.

The phrase also condemns different behavior in different fields. For instance, scientists working in fields that put an emphasis on the value of fast dissemination of research, such as HIV treatment research, often first and most visibly disseminate research results via conferences or talks rather than through printed publication. In these areas of science, printed publication occurs later in the process of dissemination of results than in some other fields. In the case of HIV, this is partly the result of AIDS activism in which people with AIDS and their allies criticized the slow pace of research. In particular, they characterized researchers who kept quiet before publication as being more interested in their careers than in the well-being of people with AIDS. On the other hand, over-hyped early findings can inspire activists&#x27; ire and even their direct and critical use of the phrase &quot;science by press conference&quot;. AIDS denialist groups have claimed that press conferences announcing findings in HIV and AIDS research, particularly Robert Gallo&#x27;s April 23, 1984, announcement of the discovery of the probable AIDS virus, inhibited research into non-HIV etiologies of AIDS.

Similarly, clinical trials and other kinds of important medical research may release preliminary results to the media before a journal article is printed. In this case, the justification can be that clinicians and patients will benefit from the information even knowing that the data are preliminary and require further review. For instance, researchers did not wait to publish journal articles about the SARS outbreak before notifying the media about many of their findings, for obvious reasons.

Another example might be the termination of a clinical trial because it has yielded early benefit. Publicizing this kind of result has obvious value; a delay of a few months might have terrible consequences when the results concern life-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the latter practice is especially vulnerable to abuse for self-serving ends and thus has drawn criticism similar to that implied by the phrase &quot;science by press conference&quot;.

These examples illustrate that the derision in the term &quot;science by press conference&quot; does not necessarily reflect an absolute rule to publish before publicizing. Rather, it illustrates the value that publicity should be a byproduct of science rather than its objective.

<text>In the United Kingdom, an unseen examination is an essay test in school or college, where the student does not know what questions are going to be asked in advance. The student is required to answer questions based upon what they have learned over the course of their academic study.

In contrast, in a seen examination the questions have been made available to the student prior to examination. A study by Joseph K. Wireko (2015) at Ghana Technology University College found that students felt more confident and less stressed when preparing for seen exams compared to traditional unseen exams. This reduction in anxiety led to better performance and a more positive learning experience.

The vast majority of UK undergraduate exams in all fields, such as law and psychology, are unseen examinations. Unseen examinations are favoured for their inherent protection against plagiarism, and their potential to develop students&#x27; ability to handle pressure and time constraints. However, they have been criticised for causing anxiety and stress in students, for negatively impacting motivation and the depth of learning experiences, and for unfairly favouring students who happen to be particularly skilled at unseen written exams as opposed to other assessment methods.

<text>CHUM (1050 kHz) is a Canadian AM radio station in Toronto, Ontario. The station is owned and operated by Bell Media. CHUM&#x27;s studios are co-located with TSN at 9 Channel Nine Court in the Agincourt neighbourhood of Scarborough (with auxiliary studios located at 250 Richmond Street West in the Entertainment District of downtown Toronto), with its transmitter array located in the Clarkson neighbourhood of Mississauga (near CFRB&#x27;s own transmitter array). TSN 1050 is simulcast on Bell Satellite TV channel 989, and on Shaw Direct channel 867. The station is also carried on the 3rd HD digital subchannel
of CKFM-FM.

==Station history==
CHUM AM has been broadcasting continuously since 1945, through a variety of format changes. The station&#x27;s history can be broken into eight distinct eras, as follows:

===The &quot;full service&quot; era: 1945-1957===

CHUM was founded by four Toronto businessmen, including Al Leary, a former sportscaster, who had been the station manager at CKCL for 14 years. CHUM received its licence in late November 1944 to operate a station with 1,000 watts. CHUM launched as a dawn-to-dusk radio station on October 28, 1945, with John H.Q. &quot;Jack&quot; Part, an entrepreneur in the business of patent medicines, as its president. The station, operating from 1947 in studios at 225 Mutual St., broadcast a format typical of the late 1940s, with a combination of information, music, and sports. When CHUM was about to debut, Leary told the press that the new station would be known for community service and in-depth news, in addition to live talent and the most popular phonograph records.

CHUM was taken over in December 1954 by Allan Waters, a salesman from Part&#x27;s patent medicine business. Waters&#x27; first major move was to secure a licence for 24-hour-a-day broadcasting for CHUM, along with a power increase to 5,000 watts.

===The Top 40 era: 1957-1986===

Less than three years after Waters acquired the station, and soon after bringing the new full-time transmitter online, a major programming change was made. On May 27, 1957, at 6 AM, Waters switched the station to a &quot;Top 50&quot; format that had proven itself popular in some U.S. cities and issued the first CHUM Chart that day. Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;All Shook Up&quot; was the first song played. &quot;1050 CHUM&quot; pioneered rock and roll radio in Toronto, and was noteworthy for hosting many noteworthy rock concerts including, among others, visits to Maple Leaf Gardens by Elvis Presley (1957) and the Beatles (1964, 1965, and 1966).

The station rose in popularity in Toronto in the late 1950s and early 1960s; though it never supplanted perennial Toronto ratings champ CFRB at the top of the ratings chart, it was still a major broadcasting powerhouse with a particular appeal to the teen market. As the station became more successful, it also built yet another new transmitter in Mississauga, Ontario (a few miles west of the current Toronto city line) along the Lake Ontario shoreline, and raised its power once again to its current 50,000 watts around the clock.

In the late 1950s, CHUM was calling itself &quot;Radio One&quot;, as its ratings continued to increase. An important part of CHUM&#x27;s success was the station&#x27;s unpredictable morning man Al Boliska, who joined CHUM in October 1957, after working at station CKLC in Kingston, Ontario. By 1959, Boliska had made a name for himself as a disc jockey who got listeners talking. He also made them laugh, and became known for telling what he called the &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Jokes&quot;. Boliska also did a number of stunts, such as taking part in a professional wrestling match with Whipper Billy Watson. When he lost, that led to another stunt, where Boliska stayed away from his show for several days, saying he was now too discouraged by the loss to do his show. A hypnotist was called in, and Boliska&#x27;s self-esteem was restored. Boliska left CHUM in late 1963 to go &#x27;across the street&#x27; to CKEY. He was replaced by WKBW Buffalo radio and TV personality Jay Nelson, popularly known as &quot;Jungle Jay&quot; from his role as host of a children&#x27;s show on Buffalo&#x27;s Channel 7 which was also popular among Toronto youngsters. He would be followed by housewives&#x27; jock John Spragge; singer/DJ Mike Darow; Pete Nordheimer, replaced in 1961 by Bob McAdorey, teen DJ Dave Johnson, and all night DJ Bob Laine. Later additions to the CHUM DJ lineup included Duff Roman and Brian Skinner, both of whom came from rival Toronto rocker CKEY (then owned by Jack Kent Cooke).

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, CHUM DJs included Duke Roberts (also known as Gary Duke for a time), Johnny Mitchell (better known today as Sonny Fox), J. Michael Wilson, Tom Rivers, Scott Carpenter, Jim Van Horne, John Rode, Don Reagan, John Majhor, Mike Cooper, Daryl B, Terry Steele, Mike Holland and morning man Roger Ashby. Among their later night-time hosts was J. D. Roberts, who joined CHUM for a time in 1977, eventually becoming known across North America as White House correspondent for CBS News, then was co-anchor of CNN&#x27;s morning program &quot;American Morning&quot; and is currently a co-anchor again now with Fox News. Rick Moranis, later famous for his work on &quot;SCTV&quot; and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, was briefly a late-night CHUM DJ in the mid-seventies under the name &quot;Rick Allan&quot;.

CHUM began to have zany contests. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was contests such as &#x27;The Walking Man&#x27;, where listeners had to spot CHUM&#x27;s mystery walking man using only clues given out on the air. The 1970s&#x27; &quot;I Listen to CHUM&quot; promotion had DJs dialing phone numbers at random and awarding $1,000 to anyone who answered the phone with that phrase. In 1976, there was the CHUM Starsign promotion. Listeners wore a button featuring their astrological sign. If CHUM&#x27;s &#x27;Starsign spotter&#x27; saw a person wearing his or her Starsign, that person won prizes such as money or concert tickets to major events.

The CHUM Chart was, for many years, the most influential weekly Top 40 chart in Canada and, at the time of its retirement in 1986, was hailed as the longest-running continuously published radio station record survey in North America. (This was later surpassed by Hamilton&#x27;s CKOC, which published weekly charts from 1960-1992.) The first CHUM Chart was released on May 27, 1957, with Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;All Shook Up&quot; the first Number 1 song.

RPM Magazine paid tribute to CHUM&#x27;s 11th anniversary with their May 25, 1968, issue.

===From top 40 to gold-based AC: 1986-1989===

By the mid-1980s, CHUM had lost ground in the Toronto ratings to competing Top 40 station CFTR and FM-based music stations. On June 6, 1986, at 3 p.m., after playing Starship&#x27;s &quot;We Built This City&quot;, CHUM dropped its Top 40 format for a gold-based adult contemporary format (&quot;Favourites of Yesterday and Today&quot;). The first song after the relaunch was &quot;Beginnings&quot; by Chicago. The change also discontinued the CHUM Chart, which ended the week of June 14, 1986, with Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Live to Tell&quot; as the final Number 1 song. By January 1989, the station had evolved into a brighter adult contemporary format (&quot;Toronto&#x27;s Soft Rock&quot;), focusing on pop hits from the past decade and dropping much of the older music. While the adult contemporary format started off with modest ratings, CHUM began to slip further over the next few years; in the September 1989 ratings book, CHUM was ranked 11th and held a 2.9 share of the Toronto market.

===The first &quot;Oldies&quot; era: 1989-2001===
On September 1, 1989, at 5 p.m., CHUM adopted an oldies format, drawing heavily on its previous Top 40 reputation to cater to the fans of that era&#x27;s music.

During the 1990s, the on-air lineup included Daryl B, Bob Magee, Kori Skinner, Andy K, Russ McLeod, Roger Kelly (Roger Kettyls), Marc Chambers and Dan Michaels. In 1989, the station acquired the broadcast rights for the Toronto Argonauts. Led by play-by-play man Marc Charbonneau and colour commentator Peter Martin, the CHUM broadcast team helped to celebrate the team&#x27;s Grey Cup victory in 1991 in Winnipeg. In 1992, the Argonauts broadcast rights would return to CFRB. By 1997, much of the airstaff was replaced with voicetracking, while the morning show remained live.

In November 1997, CHUM obtained the radio broadcast rights to Toronto Blue Jays baseball from CJCL beginning in the 1998 season, resulting in a shift towards sports programming on the station.

===The Team 1050: 2001-2002===

On January 23, 2001, CHUM Limited announced the launch of a national sports radio network, titled &quot;The Team&quot;, with CHUM serving as the network&#x27;s flagship (to be called &quot;Team 1050&quot;). As part of the synergy, Toronto Blue Jays broadcasts were available nationwide on the Team Radio Network. This also meant the end of music on 1050 CHUM, which occurred on May 7, 2001. Duff Roman and Bob Laine hosted a farewell show, ending with Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;All Shook Up&quot; (the station&#x27;s first song as a Top 40 station in 1957) and an audio montage of CHUM memories. Then, at 3 p.m., &quot;The Team Radio Network&quot; was launched on CHUM and CHUM-owned stations across Canada. Noted Canadian sportscaster Jim Van Horne, who had recently left TSN, was the network&#x27;s marquee host. (In the 1970s, before he turned to sports broadcasting, Van Horne had been a rock jock on 1050 CHUM.) The Team 1050 morning show was made up of former TSN host Paul Romanuk, longtime CHUM sportscaster Brian &#x27;Henny&#x27; Henderson and Mike Richards. While the station retained the CHUM call letters, on air the station was not referred to as 1050 CHUM, but rather as &quot;The Team 1050.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;1050 CHUM&quot; wasn&#x27;t entirely put to rest, as the oldies format continued on a 24-hour webcast at the 1050chum.com website.

&quot;The Team&quot; network did not prove successful, especially in Toronto, where CHUM struggled against long-time sports station The Fan 590 (CJCL). On August 27, 2002, the network was closed down, and while a few affiliates nationwide retained the sports format, most reverted to their pre-Team formats — including CHUM, which reverted to oldies.

===The second &quot;Oldies&quot; era: 2002-2009===

At 3 p.m. on August 27, 2002, the montage that closed down &quot;1050 CHUM&quot; reintroduced the oldies format, followed by the Elvis vs. JXL Remix of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; and Presley&#x27;s &quot;All Shook Up&quot;. The station reverted to a playlist of music (along with occasional liners and identifications) that were popular in CHUM&#x27;s 50s-to-80s Top 40 heyday. The station also featured &quot;The Morning Show with Gord James and the James Gang&quot;, as well as call-in lifestyle programs during weekend mornings. Like the latter years of the first incarnation of the oldies format, the morning show was live while other air shifts were voicetracked. In addition, the station also lost rights to broadcast Blue Jays games after the 2002 season, where they moved back to The Fan 590, coinciding with that station&#x27;s purchase by Rogers Communications, which by that time owned the Blue Jays.

In 2007, CHUM and the rest of the CHUM Limited stations (with the exception of Citytv) were sold to CTVglobemedia. That same year, CHUM commemorated the 50th anniversary of the launch of its rock and roll format, the highlights of which included vignettes and specials throughout the year, as well as anniversary celebrations on May 26, 2007 that included an open house at CHUM&#x27;s studios at 1331 Yonge Street, in conjunction with Doors Open Toronto, and a concert at Nathan Phillips Square.

====Move from the CHUM Radio building====

In 2008, CTVglobemedia announced they had sold 1331 Yonge Street to a condominium developer and had acquired a new property, 250 Richmond Street West, to serve as the new home of CHUM and CHUM-FM. On August 18, 2009, CHUM left 1331 Yonge Street, ending 50 years at its historic home. 1331 Yonge was demolished in September 2016, in order for a condominium complex to be built on the site. The new building is adjacent (and connected) to Bell Media&#x27;s Headquarters at 299 Queen Street West.

A similar move was made in May 2014, when CFRB left their longtime location at Yonge and St. Clair for 250 Richmond Street West after Bell&#x27;s acquisition of Astral Media, which brought CFRB and CHUM under the same ownership.

===CP24 Radio 1050: 2009-2011===
Almost seven years after the demise of The Team, and amidst other cost-cutting measures at CTVglobemedia and other Canadian broadcasters due to the global economic crisis and the 2007 Canada broadcast TV realignment, CTV announced on March 25, 2009 that CHUM would again drop its oldies format. At 5:00 a.m. the following day, the station flipped to all-news radio as &quot;CP24 Radio 1050&quot;. Unlike other CHUM-owned news/talk stations, the station did not originate its own news content. Instead, it was merely an audio simulcast of CP24, a GTA-centric television news channel also acquired by CTVglobemedia in the CHUM sale. The move coincided with the launch of CP24&#x27;s new morning program, &quot;CP24 Breakfast&quot; (which replaced the Citytv-originated &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;).

The change came a few weeks after the CRTC revised its formatting regulations to permit oldies music on FM radio for the first time, although at the time of the change no Toronto-area FM station had performed such a flip (CHBM-FM and Hamilton&#x27;s CING-FM both adopted a classic hits format later in the year). CKOC in Hamilton retained a more traditional AM oldies format, while oldies/adult standards station CFZM marketed itself as an alternative as well.

A number of media critics, including &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; columnist and former radio personality Ted Woloshyn, criticized &quot;CP24 Radio 1050&quot; as a poor substitute for a true news radio format. In his column on the format change, Woloshyn noted a number of instances where he could tell he was listening to content that had been prepared for television, not radio, presentation:
According to quarterly BBM surveys of Toronto radio, in 2010 the station&#x27;s audience share never rose above 0.1% of radio listeners, and CP24 Radio 1050 consistently placed dead last in the ratings in the Toronto radio market.

===TSN Radio 1050: 2011-present===
Shortly after the re-acquisition of CTVglobemedia by Bell Canada was announced in the fall of 2010, and with &quot;CP24 Radio 1050&quot; not proving to be successful, media analysts began to speculate that CTV would be converting many of its existing AM radio stations including &quot;CP24 Radio 1050&quot; into a national sports radio network co-branded with its sports television channel TSN sometime in 2011, which would compete against rival Rogers-owned Toronto radio station, The Fan 590, as the two stations previously did from 2001 to 2002.

The plans were unveiled on February 17, 2011, when CTV announced that CHUM would drop its CP24 simulcast and flip to sports radio as &quot;TSN Radio 1050&quot; on April 13, 2011, the first station under the newly formed brand. TSN considered the flip to be a &quot;soft launch&quot; for the TSN Radio brand, expecting a full launch with more local programming by September. This change came just days after Bell Canada completed its acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares in CTVglobemedia it didn&#x27;t already own, on which it renamed the company Bell Media and likewise renamed the radio division CHUM Radio to Bell Media Radio.

Ratings for CHUM/TSN radio consistently place the station at or near the bottom of Toronto radio ratings. Average cumulative listening hours from spring 2021 through summer 2022 were lower than every surveyed Toronto station except CFPT-FM. Against its direct competition of FAN 590 (the city&#x27;s other all-sports radio outlet), 1050 CHUM drew about a quarter of the FAN&#x27;s cumulative listening hours (39,000 for CHUM compared to 153,800 for FAN 590).

====Live sports programming====
&quot;TSN Radio 1050&quot; shares the official broadcasting rights of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Raptors. It is the official radio broadcaster for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League as well as Toronto FC, the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship, Men&#x27;s World Hockey Championship (Ice Hockey World Championships), NFL, NBA, Summer and Winter Olympics, 2022 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2020.

====Studios====
Studios for &quot;TSN Radio 1050&quot; are located at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Ontario where TSN&#x27;s television operations are based. This allows for programs broadcast on TSN Radio 1050 to simultaneously air on TSN or TSN2.
&quot;TSN Radio 1050&quot;&#x27;s secondary studios are located at Bell Media Radio Toronto&#x27;s studios located at 250 Richmond Street West in Downtown Toronto (which also houses sister radio stations, CHUM-FM, CKFM-FM and CFRB) which is adjacent to 299 Queen Street West (where Bell Media&#x27;s specialty channels such as MuchMusic and CP24 are based, as well as CTV&#x27;s &quot;The Marilyn Denis Show&quot;, &quot;etalk&quot; and &quot;The Social&quot;).

<text>The 1993 [[Triple J Hottest 100]], counted down in January 1994, was the inaugural countdown of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J (as opposed to previous incarnations of the poll, where listeners could vote on any recorded song from any time in history); the change to make the countdown an annual poll was made after organisers realised that the poll&#x27;s results were unlikely to significantly change from year to year. About 50,000 votes were counted for this countdown. 

A double CD featuring 32 of the songs was released. This compilation was, and many of the ones to follow in future years were, some of the highest-selling CDs in Australia.

<doc id="1174344" wikidata="Q14946773" url="?curid=1174344" title="Jean Kilbourne">
<text>Jean Kilbourne (born January 4, 1943) is an American educator, former model, filmmaker, author and activist, who is known as a pioneer of feminist advertising criticism and advocacy of media literacy. In the 1970s she was one of the top three requested speakers at college campuses in Northern America. 

Her 1979 documentary, &quot;Killing Us Softly&quot;, has been used in several fields of academy ranging from psychology to communications for several decades. In 2019, Jennifer Pozner said her points were more compelling than ever.

== Early life ==
Kilbourne was born in Junction City, Kansas. Her mother died when she was 9. She grew up in Hingham, Massachusetts. She started smoking when she was 13. She told &quot;Deseret News&quot; that quitting was the hardest thing she&#x27;d ever done. She graduated from Hingham High School in 1960.

== Education and career ==
Kilbourne has a Bachelor of Arts in English from Wellesley College and holds a Master of Arts and Doctorate in Education from Boston University.

At the time of her graduation from Wellesley, it was difficult for women to find jobs. Kilbourne had to work as a waitress and as a model while she attended secretarial school to find work in her field. She described her work as a model &quot;soul-destroying,&quot; describing a culture of sexual harassment. She then obtained a job at the BBC working as a secretary. In 1969, she started teaching at Norwell High School. Upon obtaining her MA, she taught at Emerson College until 1975.

In 1968, Kilbourne saw an ad for Ovulen 21, a birth control pill, which said it worked &quot;the way a woman thinks—by weekdays&quot; instead of by their menstrual cycles with pictures of various stereotypical tasks for a housewife. She said the ad changed her life. She began to watch for patterns in advertisements she saw and clipped them to put on her refrigerator at home. She said she noticed a trend of advertisements demeaning to women and some were &quot;shockingly violent.&quot; She then shifted her career from teaching to academia and educating the public about how the media shapes society. 

Early in her scholarly career, Kilbourne explored the connection between advertising and several public health issues, including violence against women, eating disorders, and addiction, and launched a movement to promote media literacy as a way to prevent these problems. An idea that diverged significantly from the mainstream at the time, this approach has since become mainstream and an integral part of most prevention programs. She testified twice before the United States Congress and advised two Surgeon Generals of the United States on the impact of Joe Camel, a cartoon mascot for Camel brand cigarettes, on children, and other advertising around alcohol and the portrayal of women. Kilbourne said that the advertising perpetuates unrealistic, unobtainable ideals and creates a culture of violence toward women in which they are objectified and dehumanized. Kilbourne believes that addictions are a political tool.

Kilbourne was in the 2011 documentary &quot;Miss Representation.&quot;

==Public reception and impact==
In the 1970s, Kilbourne&#x27;s work pioneered the criticism of a growing trend among advertisers to objectify women, now a robust field within feminist criticism of the media. According to &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, she was among the top three most popular guest lecturers on college campuses, speaking at more than half of all universities and colleges in Northern America. Her 2000 book, &quot;Can’t Buy My Love&quot;, was recognized with a Distinguished Publication Award from the Association for Women in Psychology.

In 2015, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2019, 40 years after the release of her documentary &quot;Killing Us Softly&quot;, Jennifer Pozner, the director of the organization Women in Media &amp; News, said, &quot;Kilbourne’s main point—that advertising creates a toxic cultural environment in which sexual objectification, physical subjugation and intellectual trivialization of women has deep psychological and political resonance—is more compelling than ever.&quot; The series has been widely used in the fields of social psychology, gender studies, and communication studies since the 1980s.

=== Criticism ===
In the 2006 article &quot;Market Feminism: The Case for a Paradigm Shift&quot; by Linda M. Scott, &quot;Still Killing Us Softly&quot; from 1987 was criticized as being a near duplicate film from the 1979 original. 

A 2012 paper calling for change in teaching materials within Women&#x27;s Studies to include androgynous body types and transgender women criticized Kilbourne&#x27;s work stating &quot;by neglecting to acknowledge or critique dominant couplings of bodies and genders, Kilbourne is able to neatly flip the terms of the binary she sets up,&quot; and that &quot;the absence of this critique is connected to her failure to interrogate the ways in which the category of women is constructed in conjunction with a host of other identity categories&quot; such as race.

=== Notable Essays ===
In &quot;Two Ways a Woman Can Get Hurt&quot;, Jean Kilbourne examines how advertising and pornography contribute to the objectification and dehumanization of women, reinforcing harmful gender norms and the normalization of rape and violence against women. The essay was published as part of her 1999 book &quot;Can’t Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel.&quot; She argues that these pornographic ads influence men and young boys to sexualize and violate women, while women and young girls are conditioned to stay passive and not speak out against their assault. She also critiques the easy accessibility of pornography, particularly content that sexualizes young girls or depicts adults as children, as a factor in the normalization of sexual exploitation. 

== Personal life ==
Kilbourne dated Ringo Starr in the 1960s while she was living in London. She was in a relationship with writer Jerzy Kosiński while in graduate school, which she described as &quot;the most important of her life.&quot; She later met poet Thomas Lux while working at Emerson. They married and they had one child before divorcing. Lux died in 2017.

While at New York University, he became part of the New York café poetry scene. He also lived in Brazil as an exchange student from 1988 to 1989.

==Career==

===Poetry===

By 1995, Williams had become an open mic poet. In 1996, he won the title of Nuyorican Poets Cafe&#x27;s Grand Slam Champion. The documentary film &quot;SlamNation&quot; follows Williams and the other members of the 1996 Nuyorican Poets Slam team (Beau Sia, muMs da Schemer, and Jessica Care Moore) as they compete in the 1996 National Poetry Slam held in Portland, Oregon. The following year, Williams landed the lead role in the 1998 feature film &quot;Slam&quot;. Williams featured as both a writer and actor in the film, which would win both the Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize and the Cannes Camera D&#x27;Or (Golden Camera).

===Music===
Around 1998, Williams was also breaking into music. He had performed with such artists as Nas, The Fugees, Christian Alvarez, Blackalicious, Erykah Badu, KRS-One, Zack De La Rocha, De La Soul, Buckethead, and DJ Krust, as well as poets Allen Ginsberg and Sonia Sanchez. After releasing a string of EPs, he released the LP &quot;Amethyst Rock Star&quot; with producer Rick Rubin in 2001. In September 2004, he released his self-titled album to much acclaim. He played several shows supporting Nine Inch Nails on their European tour in summer 2005, and has also supported The Mars Volta. Williams was invited to the Lollapalooza music festival around that time, and the Chicago stage allowed Williams to attract a wider audience. He appeared on the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;Year Zero&quot;, and supported the group on their 2006 tour of North America. On the tour, Williams announced that Trent Reznor would co-produce his next album.

This collaboration resulted in 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!&quot;. The album was available only from its website until a physical CD was issued, featuring new tracks and extended album artwork. The first 100,000 customers on the website had the option to download a free lower-quality audio version of the album. The other option was for users to pay $5 to support the artist directly and be given the choice of downloading the higher-quality MP3 version or the lossless FLAC version. The material was produced by Trent Reznor and mixed by Alan Moulder. It was Reznor who said, after his own recent dealings with record labels, that they should release it independently and directly to the audience.

In early 2008, a Nike Sparq Training commercial featured Williams&#x27; song &quot;List of Demands (Reparations)&quot;. In a November 2008 interview with Wired.com, Williams talked about his forthcoming projects: &quot;There&#x27;s one album that I&#x27;m waist-deep into. I&#x27;m aiming to finish it up next month. Trent wants to work on a sequel for &quot;Niggy&quot; that I think would be cool, and I also have an album and new songs demoed at home that I&#x27;m ready to go into the studio and lay down. It’s a complete reflection of how I feel in this country; it&#x27;s a very transformative time.&quot;

Williams&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Volcanic Sunlight&quot;, was released on November 11, 2011. Williams showcased the album at London&#x27;s Hoxton Bar Kitchen on January 26, 2011. Livemusic interviewed Williams on the evening and made a subsequent film, produced by artist Alex Templeton-Ward. When Williams was asked what the point of poetry was, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m making this up, I have no idea but here we go. I think that it would be to express, to share, to relieve, to explore. For me, poetry offers some what of a cathartic experience. I am able to move through emotions and emotional experience particularly, you know, break-ups, difficulties in all the things that I may face, whether that is with an industry or a loved one or whomever, there needs to be an infiltration process, like you have a window open over there. That is the purpose of poetry: it is the window that opens, that allows some air in, some other insight, some other possibility so we can explore all that we feel, all that we think but with the space to see more than what we know, because there is so much more than we know. If I didn&#x27;t open myself to the possibilities of the unknown, then I would be lost.&quot;

Williams&#x27; fifth album, &quot;MartyrLoserKing&quot;, was released on January 29, 2016. The first single released from the album was &quot;Burundi&quot;, a collaboration with Emily Kokal of Warpaint.

In March 2018, The Kills released their cover of Williams&#x27; &quot;List of Demands (Reparations)&quot; and Williams opened for The Kills&#x27; sold-out performance at the Regent Theater in Los Angeles on August 13, 2018.

===Writing===
As a writer, Williams has been published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Bomb Magazine&quot;, and &quot;African Voices&quot;, as well as releasing four collections of poetry. As a poet and musician, Williams has toured and lectured across the world, appearing at many universities and colleges. In his interview in the book &quot;Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam&quot;, Williams explained why he creates within so many genres: &quot;It&#x27;s not that I balance those arts out, all the different arts balance me out. So, that there is a certain type of emotion that is more easily accessible through music than poetry... some things are meant to be written, some are meant to be sung, some things are meant to be hummed, some things are made to be yelled, and so that&#x27;s just how life works.&quot;

In January 2009, he released &quot;NGH WHT The Dead Emcee Scrolls with The Arditti Quartet&quot;, a reading of his 2006 poetry book of the same name. This collaboration with Thomas Kessler (who also set Williams&#x27; spoken-word track &quot;,said the shotgun to the head&quot; to music) was released with two payment options: listeners could download chapters 18 to 22 of the 27-minute composition in MP3 format for free, or could download the entire 33-chapter composition in lossless AIFF format for $6, along with the isolated vocal and quartet multitracks. The entire paid download totalled in size at 563 megabytes. Williams contributed to two tracks on the 2011 album &quot;Baba Love&quot; by Arthur H.

===Acting===
Williams starred in &quot;Slam&quot; (1998) and &quot;Today&quot; (2012). On stage, he was chosen for the lead role in &quot;Holler If Ya Hear Me&quot;, a Broadway musical featuring music by Tupac Shakur. Though it features Shakur&#x27;s music, the musical is not about his life. It is an original script written by Todd Kreidler. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the production as &quot;the first hip-hop jukebox musical in Broadway history&quot;. The show opened on June 19, 2014. Williams&#x27; role in the musical landed him an interview on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, where he spoke about his career and performed a poem entitled &quot;Amethyst Rocks&quot;.

He received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Actor at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, for his performance in the film &quot;Akilla&#x27;s Escape&quot;.

===Directing===
In 2021, Neptune Frost, which Williams wrote and co-directed with Anisia Uzeyman, premiered in Cannes at Directors&#x27; Fortnight. The film was supported by a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2018.

==Personal life==
Williams is a vegan. He is a vocal critic of the War on Terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among his better-known works are the anti-war anthems &quot;Not in My Name&quot; and &quot;Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)&quot;. In 2011, he added his name to Occupy Musicians, supporting the worldwide Occupy movement against income inequality. He identifies as queer.

Williams and Marcia Jones, a visual artist and art professor, began their relationship in 1995 as collaborative artists on the Brooklyn performance art and spoken word poetry circuit. Their daughter, Saturn, was born in 1996. A collection of poems by Williams entitled &quot;S/HE&quot; is a series of reflections on the demise of his relationship with Jones. Jones created the cover artwork for &quot;The Seventh Octave&quot;, images throughout &quot;S/HE&quot; in response to Williams, and set-designed his 2001 album &quot;Amethyst Rock Star&quot;. Saturn performed with her father on his 2008 concert tour. Williams also has a son named Xuly with renowned choreographer Fatima Robinson.

On February 29, 2008 (his 36th birthday), Williams married actress Persia White after a five-year relationship. They met when he made a guest appearance on the series &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. On January 17, 2009, White announced via her Myspace blog that she and Williams were no longer together. He is now married to actress Anisia Uzeyman. He lived in Paris for four years but now resides in Los Angeles.

<text>National Student Marketing Corporation (N.S.M.C., NSMC) was the name of a company started by Cortes Wesley Randell, a Washington, D.C. business consultant, in 1966 during the height of the &#x27;Go-Go&#x27; 60s stock market. The corporation catered to the youth market and was touted by various Wall Street professionals. Through publicity from acquisitions and the late 1960s bull market, the stock rose from its initial public offering price of $6 a share to $140. Several universities, including the Harvard endowment fund, invested in NSMC. After the crash of 1970, and after Randell had cashed out a portion of his shares, several Wall Street professionals were convicted of wrongdoing by the government. Some of these accused were later acquitted, with at least one spending some time in jail. Following an investigation into Randell&#x27;s role in the stock crash, prosecutors alleged that he had misrepresented the company&#x27;s earnings. He pleaded guilty in 1975 and was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stock-fraud conspiracy and three other counts of fraud. Investors sued Randell in civil court and were awarded $35 million.

Financial author Andrew Tobias was a marketing director at NSMC and wrote a book about his experiences entitled &quot;The Funny Money Game&quot;.

<text>America (The Book): A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Democracy Inaction is a 2004 humor book written by Jon Stewart and other writers of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; that parodies and satirizes American politics and worldview. It has won several awards, and generated some controversy.

An updated trade paperback edition was published in 2006 as a &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Edition&quot;, with updated coverage of the Supreme Court Justices (including Samuel Alito and John Roberts, who were appointed after the 2004 book&#x27;s publication), and fact checking by Stanley K. Schultz, professor emeritus of history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, with red marks and remarks appearing throughout, correcting the satirical &quot;mistakes&quot; (and a few honest errors) of the original edition.

==Description==

&quot;America (The Book)&quot; was written and edited by Jon Stewart, Ben Karlin, David Javerbaum, and other writers of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. Karlin was the show&#x27;s executive producer and Javerbaum its head writer. The book is written as a parody of a United States high school civics textbook, complete with study guides, questions, and class exercises. Also included are scholarly &quot;Were You Aware?&quot; boxes, one of which explains that &quot;the term &#x27;Did You Know&#x27; is copyrighted by a rival publisher&quot;. The book provides discussion questions to mock history study guide books, with ridiculous questions such as: &quot;Would you rather be a king or slave? Why or why not?&quot; It pokes fun at the American political system, and includes a chapter caricaturing stereotypical American views of the rest of the world.

People affiliated with &quot;The Daily Show&quot; during publication in 2004, such as Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and Ed Helms, contributed small articles. Bee&#x27;s articles related the &quot;Canadian view point&quot; on topics, such as &quot;We have media in Canada, too!&quot; Stephen Colbert gives heavily biased viewpoints on topics such as Warren G. Harding (who is often considered one of the worst American presidents). 

One page contains mock campaign stickers for various candidates. These include &quot;Lifelong Democrat Retired Palm Beach Jews for Buchanan&quot; (referencing the butterfly ballot fracas that brought about the 2000 recount in Florida), &quot;I cast my five slaves&#x27; three votes for James K. Polk&quot; and &quot;Undecided Voters for Candidate&quot;. Another has &quot;Humphrey in &#x27;68&quot; in large print, then in much smaller print &quot;Because otherwise, in four years, Nixon&#x27;s boys will be caught breaking into the Watergate office trying to sabotage their opponents, creating unprecedented scandal and ushering in an era of cynicism that will shape politics for decades to come. Call it a hunch. So, to repeat: Humphrey in &#x27;68&quot;.

Appearing shortly before the 2004 US presidential election, the book originally included several pages of an &quot;Election Guide&quot; making fun of both candidates. Printings of the book made after the election do not have this insert.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; (PW) chose it as its &quot;Book of the Year&quot;; it noted that &quot;in a year defined by political polemics, it seems fitting that PW&#x27;s Book of the Year be one in which the authors survey the entire political system and laugh.&quot; The audiobook version won the Grammy Award in 2005 for &quot;Best Comedy Album.&quot; The book, published in September 2004, remained a bestseller even after the election. In addition to &quot;America (The Audiobook)&quot;, it has also spun off into &quot;America (The Calendar)&quot;.

==Controversy==

The fifth chapter contains obviously doctored photographs with the heads of then-current U.S. Supreme Court justices superimposed on appropriately aged naked bodies &quot;(Page 98-99)&quot;. An adjacent page invites the reader to cover each justice with a cutout of his or her robe to &quot;restore their dignity&quot;. Wal-Mart canceled its order for &quot;America (The Book)&quot; because it &quot;felt a majority of our customers would not be comfortable with the image&quot;. Some Mississippi public libraries removed the book from their shelves, but the ban was lifted the next day, after the library board had received numerous complaints.

Cartoonist Bruce Tinsley objected to the book&#x27;s parody of his comic strip &quot;Mallard Fillmore&quot;, which appears among six other cartoon parodies, captioned as dating from 1998. Tinsley referenced the parody in the July 5–8, 2005 editions of &quot;Fillmore&quot;, with the title character stating that Jon Stewart &quot;tried to deceive people into thinking&quot; that the book&#x27;s phony &quot;Fillmore&quot; was real. The strip went on to imply that Stewart was a pedophile. Stewart responded in the &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Edition&quot; by having Schultz note that although it is not a real Mallard Fillmore strip, it shows about the same level of humor as Tinsley.

==Reception==
On Metacritic, the book received a 88 out of 100 based on 12 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

==Cultural impact==

Denise Dresser and Jorge Volpi co-wrote &quot;Mexico, lo que todo ciudadano quisiera (no) saber de su patria&quot; (&quot;Mexico, what every citizen would [not] like to know about his fatherland&quot;). The book is heavily based on Stewart&#x27;s book. Jon Stewart is thanked in the book &quot;for giving the authors the idea&quot;.

The book appears in the background of a bookstore scene of the film &quot;Mr. Woodcock.&quot;

<doc id="1174356" wikidata="Q1263123" url="?curid=1174356" title="Octave (poetry)">
<text>Octave has been derived from the Latin word &quot;octāva&quot;, which means “eighth part.” It is a verse form that contains eight lines, which usually appear in an iambic pentameter. In simple words, it can be any stanza in a poem that has eight lines and follows a rhymed or unrhymed meter.

An octave is a verse form consisting of eight lines of iambic pentameter (in English) or of hendecasyllables (in Italian). The most common rhyme scheme for an octave is ABBA ABBA.

An octave is the first part of a Petrarchan sonnet, which ends with a contrasting sestet. In traditional Italian sonnets the octave always ends with a conclusion of one idea, giving way to another idea in the sestet. Some English sonnets break that rule, often to striking effect. In Milton&#x27;s Sonnet 19, the sestet begins early, halfway through the last line of the octave:

<doc id="1174358" wikidata="Q1655571" url="?curid=1174358" title="Mercury Islands">
<text>The Mercury Islands are a group of seven islands off the northeast coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. They are located off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, and northeast of the town of Whitianga.

== History ==

Great Mercury Island (Ahuahu) was occupied by both early Māori and Pākehā.

A settler claimed to have bought Great Mercury Island in 1839.

Great Mercury (Ahuahu), Kawhitu or Stanley Island and Double Island (Moturehu) were purchased and taken as crown land in 1858–65. These included Whakakapua (73 acres) and Kowhaka (21 acres) being purchased in January 1865. Despite inhabiting Ahuahu, the Ngati Hei were not consulted about this purchase.

A 2017 settlement recognized the Ngāti Hei as having a legitimate claim to Great Mercury Island.

==Description==
The main chain of the Mercury Islands consists of the large Great Mercury Island (also known as ) to the west, Red Mercury Island () to the east, and five much smaller islands between the two (Korapuki, Green, Atiu/Middle, Kawhitu/Stanley and Moturehu/Double Islands). All the islands, except Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island, have statutory protection and are managed by the Department of Conservation as highly valuable Nature Reserves where public access prohibited. Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island is privately owned and public access is allowed (excluding residential sites and the planted pine forest). One lone island, Repanga/Cuvier Island, also a protected Nature Reserve, lies to the north of Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island, although this island is not normally considered part of the Mercury Island group.

Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, the islands were hilly features surrounded by a vast coastal plain. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which the islands separated from the rest of New Zealand. When sea levels were lower, the Opitonui River flowed east to the Pacific Ocean between Cuvier Island and Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island.

===Ahuahu / Great Mercury Island===
Ahuahu / Great Mercury Island, 1872 ha, is the largest of Mercury Islands and the only one with permanent residents or public access. It is the remnants of a Pliocene rhyolitic volcano. In pre-colonial times, the island was the location of at least 20 pā, including Matakawau, a pā on the western side of the island where extensive archaeological excavations were undertaken in the 1950s. During the latter 19th century, the island was a location for kauri gum digging.

The island is owned by Michael Fay and David Richwhite, two prominent New Zealand businessmen. The private island, which features two luxurious residences, can be hired for around $20,000 NZD per day. U2&#x27;s lead singer Bono and guitarist The Edge stayed on the island during U2&#x27;s Vertigo concerts in Auckland in November 2006. On 30 November 2009, Ahuahu/Great Mercury Island hosted the first successful launch of Rocket Lab&#x27;s suborbital Atea-1 sounding rocket.

In 2014, Fay and Richwhite, in partnership with the Department of Conservation, successfully undertook an eradication program to remove kiore, ship rats and cats from the island. In 2016, it was declared pest free, making the entire Mercury Island Group free from introduced mammalian pests. The island remains open to the public to showcase conservation and provide an accessible pest-free island in the Mercury Island Group.

===Whakau / Red Mercury Island===
Whakau is the easternmost of the Mercury Islands, and at across is also the second-largest. The entire island is surrounded by reddish cliffs up to high, prompting Captain James Cook to give the island its European name on his exploration of the area in 1769. The island was briefly used by Count Felix von Luckner as a hiding spot during World War One during his attempted escape from New Zealand en route to the Kermadec Islands, with a cove on the island&#x27;s northern coast bearing his name to commemorate this. As with the rest of the Mercury Islands, Whakau is volcanic, with evidence of this history evident around the island&#x27;s coast.

===Other islands===
The smaller islands in the group have been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because they provide nesting sites for up to 3000 breeding pairs of Pycroft&#x27;s petrels. Moturehu/Double Island and Whakau/Red Mercury are home to the critically endangered Mercury Islands tusked wētā.

<doc id="1174370" wikidata="Q4885651" url="?curid=1174370" title="Ben Folds Live">
<text>Ben Folds Live is a live album by Ben Folds, released on October 8, 2002. This album marked the first official release of the improvisation, &quot;Rock This Bitch&quot;. The song, which changes with every performance, is now a staple of his live performances, with recorded versions also appears on his later albums &quot;Songs for Goldfish&quot; (under the name &quot;Weather Channel Music&quot;) and on the &quot;Live in Perth&quot; DVD (in which he &quot;rocks this bitch orchestrally&quot; with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra).

This album was made available for a limited time with a bonus DVD. It had 8 tracks, including a video of the audience shooting the front cover (during which they all gave him the finger and yelled &quot;Ben Folds sucks!&quot;). This was also the first appearance of the altered, minor-key version of the Ben Folds Five song &quot;Song for the Dumped&quot; on an official release. This version also includes Darren Jessee&#x27;s &quot;missing lyrics&quot; (&quot;You fucking whore&quot; repeated a few times).

The Japanese release of the album included a live version of &quot;Eddie Walker&quot; and the studio recording of &quot;Bizarre Christmas Incident&quot;. The &#x27;L&#x27; in &quot;Live&quot; on the front cover is actually an upside-down &#x27;F&#x27;, as though it used to say &quot;Ben Folds Five&quot;, the name of Ben&#x27;s group before he began his solo career.

The cover of the album was taken June 8, 2002 by David Leyes at Avalon in Boston, MA during the &quot;Ben Folds and a Piano&quot; tour. The original image is of everyone in the crowd giving Ben the middle finger, however the fingers are edited out of the photo in the cover shown here. The &quot;explicit&quot; version of the cover shows the fingers.

<doc id="1174374" wikidata="Q6254224" url="?curid=1174374" title="John Randolph Tucker (naval officer)">
<text>John Randolph Tucker (January 31, 1812 – June 12, 1883),was an American naval officer who served in the navies of three nations. He was a commander in the United States Navy, captain in the Confederate States Navy, and rear admiral in the Peruvian Navy. As president of the Peruvian Hydrographic Commission of the Amazon, he contributed to the exploration and mapping of the upper Amazon Basin.

==Early life==
He was born in Alexandria, Virginia to merchant captain John Tucker, originally from Bermuda, and Susan Douglas, daughter of Dr. Charles Douglas, an English physician.

==United States Navy==
Tucker became a United States Navy Midshipman on June 1, 1826, at age fourteen, and had service afloat in the Mediterranean and Brazil Squadrons prior to his promotion to Lieutenant on December 20, 1837. During the Mexican–American War, he served as a lieutenant commander in the Gulf of Mexico, commanding USS &quot;Stromboli&quot; until illness forced him to return north. From 1849 until 1855, he was assigned to the Home Squadron (1849–1852) and Mediterranean Squadron (1852–1855) flagships. Tucker received his commission as commander on September 14, 1855, when he became commanding officer of USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. He later served as officer at the Norfolk Navy Yard.

==Confederate States Navy service==

Commander Tucker resigned from the U.S. Navy when Virginia seceded from the Union on April 18, 1861, becoming a commander in the Virginia Navy and, in June, the Confederate States Navy. In 1861–62, he was the commanding officer of CSS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, armed with 10 guns and manned by 150 officers and sailors, participating with her in several combat actions, including supporting the ironclad in the Battle of Hampton Roads. In April 1862 he took command of the James River Squadron, which included the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;. During the Federal Navy&#x27;s attack on the Drewry&#x27;s Bluff fortifications in May 1862, he commanded one of the defending batteries in the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff.

In July 1862, Tucker was ordered to Charleston, South Carolina, where he took command of the ironclad CSS &quot;Chicora&quot;. The following January 31, he led his ship in a successful attack on Union warships off that port engaging several Federal ships, including the USS &quot;Keystone State&quot;, in a gun battle. He became commander of the Confederate warships at Charleston in March 1863, remaining in that post until the city fell in February 1865. During that time, he was promoted to captain and aggressively pursued spar-torpedo warfare against U.S. warships. He was ordered to scuttle his vessels and retreat to Wilmington, North Carolina after General William T. Sherman with his army came to Charleston. Tucker formed a marine detachment from the crews of ships which became known as &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Marine Brigade&quot;.

During the U.S. Civil War&#x27;s last weeks he served with his men in the defenses of Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, manning Fort Darling on Drewry&#x27;s Bluff on the James River while the Confederate States Army was facing its final destiny at Appomattox, Virginia. He surrendered in the field on April 6, 1865, at the Battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek, southwest of Petersburg, and remained a prisoner of war until July 24. After his release, he returned to the South to work as an agent of the Southern Express Company of Raleigh, North Carolina.

==Peruvian Navy==
In 1866, the Peruvian Minister to the United States contacted Tucker to arrange an interview in Washington, D.C. At that time, Peru and Chile were in the Chincha Islands War with Spain, and the Peruvian President, General Mariano Ignacio Prado, invited Tucker to join their Navy as a rear admiral, bringing with him two staff officers of his choice. Prado planned for Tucker to lead the allied fleet of Peru and Chile against the Spanish, leading a campaign against the Philippines. Tucker accepted the position and went to Peru with Captain David Porter McCorkle and Commander Walter Raleigh Butt. After arriving at Valparaiso, Chile, Tucker raised his flag on board the Peruvian armored frigate &quot;Independencia&quot;.

Although some Peruvian naval officers objected to a foreigner in command of their fleet, Tucker did his best to raise the battle preparedness of the combined navies of Peru and Chile. Several Peruvian naval officers, led by Captain Lizardo Montero, felt insulted at such a decision since they felt that they had shown they were just as capable as any other officers to lead and win a naval battle and resigned to their command commissions. Among these Manuel Ferreyros, Aurelio García y García and also, including Miguel Grau Seminario, later known as &quot;the Knight of the Seas&quot; at the War of Guano and Salitre (1879-1883), they all resigned to their commissions due to Tucker&#x27;s appointment. After the Spanish fleet left South America&#x27;s Pacific coast, Tucker stepped down as fleet commander but remained a rear admiral because of the support of President Prado.

==Peruvian Hydrographic Commission of the Amazon==
Tucker resigned from the Peruvian Navy in 1871. He was then appointed president of the Hydrographic Commission of Peru on the Amazon River, which included a group of American and Peruvian naval officers and engineers, James Henry Rochelle, David Porter McCorkle, Walter Raleigh Butt, and Thomas Wing Sparrow, among others. The expedition surveyed the upper Amazon River and its tributaries and discovered two new rivers, the Trinidad and the Herrera-yacu. Tucker traveled to New York upon completion of the expedition to have maps and atlases made and the commission&#x27;s findings published.

John Randolph Tucker died in his home at Petersburg, Virginia, on June 12, 1883. His remains were interred in Norfolk, Virginia where his wife was already laid to rest after she died in 1858 at age thirty-nine. His collected papers are preserved in the library of Old Dominion University.

==Family==
On June 7, 1838, Tucker married Virginia Webb, daughter of U.S. Navy captain Thomas Tarleton Webb, and they had nine children.

<doc id="1174375" wikidata="Q1071396" url="?curid=1174375" title="Chevra kadisha">
<text>The term chevra kadisha () gained its modern sense of &quot;burial society&quot; in the nineteenth century. It is an organization of Jewish men and women who see to it that the bodies of deceased Jews are prepared for burial according to Jewish tradition and are protected from desecration, willful or not, until burial. Two of the main requirements are the showing of proper respect for a corpse, and the ritual cleansing of the body and subsequent dressing for burial. It is usually referred to as a burial society in English.

==Etymology==
In Rabbinic and Modern Hebrew, &quot;sacred society&quot; would be written (&quot;ḥavurā qəḏošā&quot;), while in Aramaic, it would be (&quot;ḥavurtā qaddištā&quot;). &quot;Chevra qadisha&quot; has an unclear etymology. The Aramaic phrase is first attested in the &quot;Yekum Purkan&quot; in a 13th-century copy of the &quot;Machzor Vitry&quot;, but it was rarely used again in print until it gained its modern sense of &quot;burial society&quot; in the nineteenth century. The Hebrew phrase predated its modern popularity for decades. The current phrase is probably a phonetic transliteration of the Ashkenazic pronunciation of the Hebrew version, which has been misinterpreted as an Aramaic phrase and, therefore, spelled with a yodh and aleph.

==History==
Throughout Jewish history, each Jewish community throughout the world has established a chevra kadisha – a holy society – whose sole function is to ensure dignified treatment of the deceased following Jewish law, custom, and tradition. Men prepare the bodies of men; women prepare those of women.

At the heart of the society&#x27;s function is the ritual of &quot;tahara&quot; &quot;purification&quot;. The body is first thoroughly cleansed of dirt, bodily fluids and solids, and anything else that may be on the skin, and then is ritually purified by immersion in, or a continuous flow of, water from the head over the entire body. &quot;Tahara&quot; may refer to the whole process or the ritual purification. Once the body is purified, the body is dressed in &quot;tachrichim&quot;, or shrouds, of white pure muslin or linen garments made up of ten pieces for a man and twelve for a woman, which are identical for each Jew and which symbolically recall the garments worn by the High Priest of Israel. Once the body is shrouded, the casket is closed. For burial in the Holy Land (including modern Israel), a casket is not used in most cemeteries.

The society may also provide &quot;shomrim&quot; to guard against body snatching, vermin, or desecration until burial. In some communities, this is done by people close to the departed or by paid &quot;shomrim&quot; hired by the funeral home. At one time, the danger of the body being stolen was very real; in modern times, the watch has become a way of honoring the deceased.

A specific task of the burial society is tending to the dead with no next of kin. These are termed a &quot;met mitzvah&quot; ( &quot;mitzvah corpse&quot;), as tending to a &quot;met mitzvah&quot; overrides virtually any other positive commandment (), an indication of the high premium the Torah places on the honor of the dead.

Many burial societies hold one or two annual fast days and organise regular study sessions to remain up-to-date with the relevant articles of Jewish law. In addition, most burial societies also support families during the &quot;shiva&quot; (traditional week of mourning) by arranging prayer services, meals and other facilities.

While burial societies were, in Europe, generally a community function, in the United States, it has become far more common for societies to be organized by neighbourhood synagogues. In the late 19th and early 20th century, burial societies were formed as landsmanshaftn (mutual aid societies) in the United States. Some landsmanshaftn were burial societies, while others were independent of the traditional burial society. There were 20,000 such landsmanshaftn in the U.S. at one time.

===Recordkeeping===
The burial societies of communities in pre-World War II Europe maintained &quot;Pinkas Klali D’Chevra Kadisha&quot; (translation: general notebook of the Chevra Kadisha); some were handwritten in Yiddish, others in Hebrew.

<text>Frederick S. Mates, aka Frederic Mates, founded in August 1967 the Mates Investment Fund, a high-flying mutual fund during the &#x27;Go-Go&#x27; 60s that later crashed in the bear market of the early 1970s. Mates ran his fund from an office he dubbed the &quot;kibbutz&quot; and with a young staff he called his &quot;flower children&quot;. Mates put most of his fund into a letter stock known as Omega Equities. Mates in determining his funds assets assigned a value to the barely traded Omega of $16 a share, while having purchased the stock at $3.25 a share. Mates got into trouble over this practice which was routine in the 1960s and not uncommon even today, of accounting for letter stocks at a price different from what was paid for it. As a result, when confidence was lost in Mates&#x27; mutual fund and investors wanted to cash out, redemptions had to be suspended for a while, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission condoned.

Mates was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954. According to a New York Times obituary, Mates died in Kansas City on December 25, 1982.

<doc id="1174395" wikidata="Q5537575" url="?curid=1174395" title="George C. Pidgeon">
<text>George Campbell Pidgeon (March 2, 1872 – June 15, 1971) was a Christian minister, first in the Presbyterian Church in Canada and then in the United Church of Canada, as well as the last Moderator of the Presbyterian Church before amalgamation and the first Moderator of the newly formed United Church of Canada. He was a strong proponent of the proposed union of churches and later in life championed ecumenism.
Pidgeon was ordained by the Presbyterian Church in 1894 and earned his Doctor of Divinity degree from Montreal&#x27;s Presbyterian College. His first posting was at Montreal West Presbyterian Church (now Montreal West United Church). He then moved to the Toronto area, serving first in the Streetsville area (now Mississauga), before moving to the West Toronto Junction area.

From 1909 to 1915, he left pastoral ministry to teach theology at Westminster Hall in Vancouver. He then returned to Toronto in 1916, where he served as minister of Bloor Street Presbyterian (now Bloor Street United Church).

He became Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in 1925, and was a strong proponent of the proposed church union between the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregationalist Churches in Canada. However, a substantial minority of Presbyterians remained opposed to church union. Their threat to the entire project was resolved by giving individual Presbyterian congregations the right to vote on whether to enter or remain outside the United Church. In the end, 302 out of 4,509 congregations of the Presbyterian Church (211 from southern Ontario) chose to reconstitute themselves as a &quot;continuing&quot; Presbyterian Church in Canada.
With the pro-union support of the majority of Presbyterian congregations now guaranteed, The United Church of Canada was inaugurated at a large worship service at Toronto&#x27;s Arena Gardens on June 10, 1925.

The ecumenical tone of the new church was set at the first General Council in 1925. The former Methodist General Superintendent Samuel Dwight Chown was considered the leading candidate to become the first Moderator because the Methodist Church made up the largest segment of the new United Church. However, in a surprise move, Chown stepped aside in favour of Pidgeon in the hopes that this would strengthen the resolve of the Presbyterians who had chosen to join the new Church. As first Moderator of the United Church of Canada, Pidgeon served for one year.

Pidgeon was a supporter of the temperance movement, home missionary service and later in life, was one of the driving forces behind the formation of ecumenical organizations such as the Canadian Council of Churches in 1945 and the World Council of Churches in 1946.

He served as minister of Bloor Street United Church for 32 years, retiring in 1948. He died in 1971 at the age of 99.

<text>Simei MRT station is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East–West line (EWL) in Tampines, Singapore. Operated by SMRT Trains, the station serves the eponymous Simei residential estate. Other nearby landmarks include Eastpoint Mall and Changkat Primary and Secondary School. Like other stations of the Tanah Merah-Pasir Ris stretch, the station has a domed roof design and a distinctive colour for its restricted areas and ceiling trunking box. It is wheelchair accessible.

First announced in May 1982 as Tampines South, it was to be constructed as part of Phase II of the MRT system. The name was later changed in 1983. Before constructing the station, of land was acquired for viaducts leading to the station. It commenced operations on 17 December 1988 along with the other stations on the Tanah Merah–Pasir Ris stations stretch. In February 1995, an approaching train opened its doors too early as the train driver violated standard procedures, resulting in several people nearly falling. Accessibility enhancements were completed in July 2011 as well as additional bicycle parking facilities in October 2012. Half-height platform screen doors and high-volume low-speed fans were installed by August 2011 and the first quarter of 2013, respectively. Noise barriers were installed by 2018. The station was temporarily closed in December 2024 for track works for East Coast Integrated Depot (ECID). 

==History==
Simei station was first included in the early plans of the MRT system as Tampines South in May 1982. It was later announced to be part of Phase II of the MRT in October 1983 as Simei station.

Before the construction of the station, of land between Jalan Angin Laut and Sunbird Road were acquired in March 1985 to build viaducts to the station. Several joint ventures between companies were prequalified for Contract 306 by May 1985, which detailed the construction of Changi Depot to Pasir Ris station, including Simei station. Contract 306 was ultimately awarded to a joint venture between Resource Development Corporation (RDC) and Sata Kogyo for in March 1986. Construction of the station began in May 1986. Before it was opened publicly, there was a preview of the station for nearby residents. The station was opened along with Tanah Merah to Pasir Ris stations on 17 December 1989. During the opening ceremony, then Minister of State for the Ministries of Communications and Trade and Industry Mah Bow Tan addressed to a crowd of more than 300 guests in Simei station, before riding a train to Pasir Ris station with them.

In June 1990, it was announced that Simei station would have three new footpaths leading to the station. This came after a letter was published on &quot;The Straits Times&quot; revealing that residents of Harvey Avenue, Jalan Angin Laut and Sunbird Road had to walk on a grass verge to get to the station, which became muddy when it rained as well as posing a risk for the elderly and young children during the night. The footpaths connected the end of Sea Breeze Road to Simei Street 3 near Block 101, Jalan Angin Laut to Simei Street 3, and Sunbird Avenue to Simei Street 4 near Block 222. Moreover, the station was criticised for its design in another letter sent to &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in 1992, claiming that commuters without umbrellas could only walk &quot;along a half-metre wide platform next to plant bins&quot; to the adjacent building compound (Block 248). SMRT responded by revealing that there were plans to build a sheltered walkway between the station and Block 248 but it was put on hold as the land used was to be developed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) the next year. 

On 23 February 1995, at about 7:50 pm, a train approaching the station opened its doors early when half of it was in the station, which resulted in people almost falling over as they thought the train had fully stopped. SMRT explained that the driver of the train violated standard procedures as the doors of the train are normally supposed to be on &#x27;automatic mode&#x27;, such that all of the doors open when the train fully enters a station. However, the driver accidentally activated &#x27;manual mode&#x27;, which allows the driver to open all of the doors as long as the train is not moving, which is meant to be used with prior permission. 

In 2008, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced an accessibility enhancement programme for ten stations, including Simei. The programme included adding ramps, covered linkways, and taxi stands with wheelchair access. It was completed by July 2011 at a cost of . Simei station was the first batch of ten stations announced in 2010 to have additional bicycle parking facilities as a response to the growing demand for bicycle parking spots. The installation was completed in October 2012. Following a rise in track intrusions as well as commuters slipping when rushing for the train, the LTA and SMRT decided to install platform screen doors. Half-height platform screen doors were eventually installed and commenced operations at Simei station by August 2011. The station was installed with high-volume low-speed fans by the first quarter of 2013. Noise barriers were installed on the viaducts from Simei Street 3 to Harvey Crescent by Precise Development Pte Ltd as part of two contracts awarded in December 2013 to reduce sounds generated by trains. It was installed by 2018. In the same year, Eunos was one of ten stations that was affected by early closures, late openings and full closures of the eastern portion of the East–West Line (EWL), from 5 January to 4 February as a part of works for rail maintenance and checks for a new signalling system. 

As a part of track works for the East Coast Integrated Depot (ECID), it was announced by the LTA in November 2024 that Simei station would not be in operation between 7-10 December 2024 as it is part of a safety buffer zone between Tampines and Tanah Merah stations where power has to be turned off in order for the third rail to be safely removed. During the suspension, there was a shuttle bus service for affected commuters that went from Tampines to Tanah Merah stations, including Simei. On 9 December, it was announced that passenger services to the affected stations would resume the following the day as the works were done ahead of schedule.

== Details ==
Simei station is on the EWL with the station code of EW3, situated between Tampines and Tanah Merah station. When it opened, it had the station code of E10 before being changed to its current station code in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System. As a part of the EWL, the station is operated by SMRT Trains. Like many stations on the initial MRT network, Simei has an island platform. The station operates between 5:19am and 12:37am daily, with train frequencies varying from 2 to 5 minutes. It is also wheelchair-accessible and has bicycle facilities.

Simei station is named after the estate it serves, which is a Pinyin romanization of the Four Beauties of ancient China. The station is bounded by Simei Streets 1 and 3 as well as Simei Streets 5 and 6. It also has one exit and serves surrounding amenities such as Eastpoint mall, Changkat Primary and Secondary School, Changi Simei Community Club, and Changi Neighbourhood police centre.

Similar to other stations on the Tanah Merah-Pasir Ris stretch, Simei has a dome-shaped roof. The design was an attempt by the MRT Corporation (MRTC) to give the stations on the EWL an &quot;attractive look&quot;. It has a distinctive colour on the doors of restricted areas and ceiling trunking box on the platform to aid in identification, using nutmeg brown.

<text>The Lawrence Arms are an American punk rock band from Chicago, formed in 1999. They have released seven full-length albums and toured extensively.

==Band history==
===Pre-history===
Prior to forming the Lawrence Arms, the three band members were active in other Chicago-area bands. Brendan Kelly had played in the ska punk band Slapstick. Chris McCaughan had played in Tricky Dick before joining Kelly in the punk band the Broadways. McCaughan and Kelly also shared an apartment together on Chicago&#x27;s north side. Neil Hennessy, meanwhile, had played in a band called Baxter. Both Slapstick and the Broadways released albums on Asian Man Records, a small record label based in Monte Sereno, California, that would later release albums by the Lawrence Arms.

===Formation and Asian Man years===
The three musicians came together to form the Lawrence Arms in 1999, taking their name from the apartment complex in which Kelly and McCaughan had lived before being evicted in the middle of the night. Although punk rock bands in their infancy generally start out by releasing EPs and 7-inch vinyl singles, the band members used their existing relationship with Asian Man Records to immediately begin recording a full-length album, &quot;A Guided Tour of Chicago&quot;, which was released later that year and before the band had even played a single show. A second album, &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, followed in 2000. Both albums focused heavily on the members&#x27; own stories of growing up and living in Chicago.

The band&#x27;s next two releases were split EPs with other bands. The first, a split with Shady View Terrace, was released in 2000 and was their first release to be recorded by Matt Allison, who would continue to record and produce all of their subsequent releases. A second EP, &quot;Present Day Memories&quot;, was released in 2001 and was a split with the Chinkees.

===Signing to Fat Wreck Chords===
The band&#x27;s split with the Chinkees had brought them to the attention of Fat Mike of NOFX, who signed them to his Fat Wreck Chords label in late 2001. Their first release on the label was a 7-inch vinyl single, part of the label&#x27;s &quot;Fat Club&quot; series of 7-inch records. This was followed by the full-length album &quot;Apathy and Exhaustion&quot;, released in 2002. The album spawned the band&#x27;s second music video, for the song &quot;Porno and Snuff Films,&quot; and they toured extensively with NOFX and other bands from the Fat label.
Their next album was 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. Their most ambitious album to date, it demonstrated the band members&#x27; continued growth as musicians and songwriters and included extensive footnotes to the lyrics detailing their many references to history, literature, and pop culture. It also showed an evolution in the band&#x27;s vocal style. Kelly had sung most of the vocals on their first album, while on subsequent releases he and McCaughan had split vocal duties almost equally from one song to the next, with Kelly&#x27;s voice tending to sound more harsh and urgent while McCaughan&#x27;s sounds more relaxed and melodic. With this release, however, the two began to move towards more of a duet style of singing which would feature prominently on their next album. Extensive touring following the album&#x27;s release saw the band on the road for much of 2003 and 2004. They also contributed a song to the Fat Wreck Chords &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2&quot; compilation, leading up to the 2004 presidential election and became involved with the Punk Voter campaign.

The Lawrence Arms also played a portion of the 2004 Warped Tour, but the band&#x27;s attitude towards the tour resulted in controversy. In a 2006 interview, Kelly claimed that the band &quot;did like seven days of it and we got kicked off it, banned for life&quot; for &quot;pointing out the obvious flaws of the Warped Tour, on stage while the people running the Warped Tour were watching us.&quot; When asked his opinion of the tour, Kelly responded:
Warped Tour, it’s destroying the economy of DIY; and it’s doing it very methodically and very successfully in that [the] summer touring season used to involve a bunch of bands, like Alkaline Trio for example, jumping on buses and taking smaller bands, like us and the Black Maria for example, on tour. There would be all these bands that would do that, so all these support bands would have great tours to go on. Kids in every town would have a bunch of different shows to go see, like over the summer. Small clubs would have big, good shows at least once a week if not twice a week, three times a week; and kids would have stuff to do. Now, all those big bands go on the Warped Tour. When they come to town, it’s for one day. It’s in a band shell, small clubs all across the US are closing down, they can’t afford to be open. Bands like us have to tour against the Warped Tour, which sucks; or tour on the Warped Tour, which sucks even more.
He further likened the experience of Warped Tour to &quot;going to a band shell and buying twelve dollar bottles of water and standing there watching your favorite band play from like a million feet away.&quot; He also criticized the tour&#x27;s effect on punk rock and independent music as a whole: &quot;Now people talk about the Warped Tour like it&#x27;s the greatest thing to ever happen to punk rock, it&#x27;s not the greatest thing to ever happen to punk rock - it&#x27;s single handedly dismantling the whole thing we&#x27;ve been fucking building for all this time and nobody gives a fuck...And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s the worst thing to ever happen to punk rock, or DIY music in general.&quot; Their next album, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;, included a hidden track entitled &quot;Warped Summer Extravaganza (Major Excellent)&quot; referencing their attitude towards the tour.

===The Falcon, Sundowner, and &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;===
In December 2004 Kelly and Hennessy joined with fellow Chicago natives Dan Andriano of the Alkaline Trio (who had played with Kelly in Slapstick) and Todd Mohney, formerly of Rise Against, to form another band called the Falcon, and released an EP on Red Scare Industries. Meanwhile, Asian Man Records released a Lawrence Arms compilation album titled &quot;Cocktails &amp; Dreams&quot; including tracks from out-of-print split releases along with other rarities, b-sides, and re-recordings.

The Lawrence Arms re-entered the studio in October and November 2005 and recorded the album &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;, which was released on Fat Wreck Chords in March 2006. The album was noted as faster and more energetic than the band&#x27;s prior releases, with Kelly and McCaughan sharing lead vocals on every track. A music video was released for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Takin&#x27; Names&quot; from the album.

In March 2007, McCaughan released the debut album &quot;Four One Five Two&quot; from his acoustic side-project Sundowner, featuring two Lawrence Arms covers, one of which, &quot;Boatless Booze Cruise&quot; was originally sung by Kelly. The Lawrence Arms toured again in the fall of 2007, with their side projects the Falcon and Sundowner as openers along with the recently reunited American Steel. McCaughan also toured as Sundowner in the mainly acoustic/folk &quot;Revival Tour&quot; featuring Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music, Ben Nichols of Lucero, and Tim Barry. Hennessy also joined fellow Chicagoans Smoking Popes on drums, touring and releasing music with them.

===Recent activity===
In June 2009, the Lawrence Arms recorded a studio EP. Titled &quot;Buttsweat and Tears&quot;, it was released on October 27 of that year through Fat Wreck Chords both as a 7-inch EP and as a digital download with an extra song. They then went on a tenth anniversary performance in October at the Metro Chicago, followed by a seven-date headlining tour of Arizona and California in November with Teenage Bottlerocket and Cobra Skulls as support.

The band’s 10th-anniversary performance at The Metro in their hometown of Chicago was recorded and slated for a release on DVD by Crankstrap Productions. However, complications that might have included logistics at Crankstrap, and/or might have included the band’s being audited by the IRS, meant that the DVD was consigned to purgatory until 2012, when Fat Wreck Chords announced that the video, titled &quot;An Evening of Extraordinary Circumstance,&quot; would finally be released on June 5 by them in collaboration with Crankstrap, a partnership previously announced in April 2011.

The Lawrence Arms signed with Epitaph Records and released their sixth studio album, &quot;Metropole,&quot; on January 28, 2014, along with the &quot;News From Yalta&quot; 7-inch.

On May 27, 2020, the band released &quot;PTA&quot;, the lead single from their first album in six years and seventh overall studio album, &quot;Skeleton Coast&quot;, which was released on July 17 via Epitaph Records.

<text>The Willys Jeep Truck is a truck made by Willys-Overland Motors from 1947 to 1965. The styling and engineering of the Jeep Truck was based on Willys&#x27; existing vehicles, the Willys Jeep Station Wagon and the Jeep CJ-2A.

==Production==
The Jeep Truck was introduced in 1947 as a 1-ton four-wheel drive truck with a wheelbase of . It was available as a pickup truck, a platform stake truck, a chassis cab, or a bare chassis. A ¾-ton two-wheel drive version became available by 1949.

The truck was restyled in 1950 with the addition of a V-shaped grille with five horizontal bars. In 1951 the &quot;Hurricane&quot; IOE four cylinder engine replaced the earlier flathead engine, increasing power from to .

Optional accessories included an engine governor, a power takeoff, and a pulley drive. A &quot;Dump-O-Matic&quot; hydraulic hoist became available for 1957.

Over 200,000 of these trucks were manufactured.

===Models===

==Drivetrain==
The Jeep Truck was available with only one transmission, the Borg-Warner T-90 three-speed manual, with synchromeshed second and third gears. A Spicer/Dana 18 transfer case was used on four-wheel drive models. The heavy duty Timken 51540 was used in the early years of production, later being replaced by the Dana 53. The front axle was a Dana 25

<doc id="1174440" wikidata="Q536852" url="?curid=1174440" title="Robert Roswell Palmer">
<text>Robert Roswell Palmer (January 11, 1909 – June 11, 2002) was an American historian at Princeton and Yale universities, who specialized in eighteenth-century France. His most influential work of scholarship, &quot;The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800&quot; (1959 and 1964), examined the Atlantic Revolutions, an age of democratic revolution that swept Europe and the Americas between 1760 and 1800. He was awarded the Bancroft Prize in History for the first volume. Palmer also achieved distinction as a history text writer.

==Life==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Palmer accelerated through the public schools. By winning a citywide contest for a play written in Latin, he earned a full scholarship to the University of Chicago where he studied with the historian Louis Gottschalk and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree (Ph.B.) in 1931. He received his Ph.D. in History from Cornell University three years later, studying with Carl L. Becker. His dissertation was &quot;The French Idea of American Independence on the Eve of the French Revolution&quot; – &quot;published/created&quot; 1934.

Palmer began teaching at Princeton University as an instructor in 1936, and worked there for nearly three decades, becoming a full professor. He was dean of arts and sciences (1963–1966) at Washington University in St. Louis, then returned to teaching and writing at Yale, where he retired as &quot;professor emeritus&quot;. Palmer had visiting professorships at numerous universities, including Berkeley, Chicago, Colorado and Michigan. After retiring in 1977, he returned to Princeton as a guest scholar at its Institute for Advanced Study.

Palmer married Esther Howard in 1942, and they had three children and four grandchildren. His son, the historian Stanley Palmer, is a professor of history at the University of Texas at Arlington. After R.R. Palmer&#x27;s death in 2002 at Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a memorial service was held at Princeton Chapel.

==Work==
In 1950 Palmer published &quot;A History of the Modern World&quot;, which is in its eleventh edition as of 2013. (Joel Colton is a co-author from 1956 the 2nd edition, and Lloyd Kramer is coauthor from 2002, the 9th ed.) The text has been translated into six languages and is used in more than 1000 colleges and many AP European History high school courses. It is notable for its clear, essay-like writing style. Palmer&#x27;s introduction covers the period from the earliest signs of human civilization to 1300 CE. The main body of the text covers events from the Black Death to the Fall of the Soviet Union in European history. The book is organized partly by ideas: for example, the relation of the French Revolution to modern and ancient thought may be mentioned before the French Revolution.

Palmer&#x27;s most important work of historical scholarship is &quot;The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800&quot;. It was published by Princeton in two volumes: &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1959), which won the Bancroft Prize in American History, and &quot;The Struggle&quot; (1964). Palmer&#x27;s masterwork traced the growth of two competing forces – ideas of democracy and equality, on the one hand, and the growing power of aristocracies in society, on the other – and the results of the collision between these forces, including both the American Revolution and the French Revolution. Thus it foreshadowed the development of &quot;comparative Atlantic history&quot; as a field. It remains a valuable resource for scholars. In 1971 Palmer published a slightly revised and condensed version of the second volume as &quot;The World of the French Revolution&quot;.

The 1941 monograph &quot;Twelve Who Ruled&quot; is also noteworthy. It has been in print since its first edition, was reissued with a new preface in 1989 for the French Revolution bicentennial, and was reissued as a Princeton Classic in 2005 as part of the University Press centennial celebration. The book is a fusion of history and collective biography, focusing on the members of the Committee of Public Safety and their efforts to guide France during the Terror following their Revolution. Columbia University history professor Isser Woloch, a specialist in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, has stated that &quot;Twelve Who Ruled&quot; &quot;may be the best book on the French Revolution written by an American.&quot;

<doc id="1174444" wikidata="Q15516106" url="?curid=1174444" title="John Bradstreet">
<text>Major General John Bradstreet, born Jean-Baptiste Bradstreet (21 December 1714 – 25 September 1774) was a British Army officer during King George&#x27;s War, the French and Indian War, and Pontiac&#x27;s War. He was born in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, to a British Army lieutenant and an Acadian mother. He also served as the Commodore-Governor for Newfoundland.

==Life==
Jean-Baptiste Bradstreet was the son of Agathe de Saint Etienne de La Tour and her first husband, Edward Bradstreet. It is unknown whether he was related to Puritan Simon Bradstreet. Bradstreet died in New York City on 25 September 1774. He had married (to the widow of a cousin who shared his name), and had two children.

==Military service==
Through his Acadian mother&#x27;s influence he was accepted into the regular British army in 1735. Bradstreet&#x27;s early military service consisted of garrison duty in Nova Scotia with the 40th Regiment of Foot, during which time he took advantage of his Acadian heritage and engaged in trade with the French at Louisbourg. As a young officer he was stationed at Canso, during King George&#x27;s War he was captured in the French raid on Canso, however he was released within a year. During his internment Bradstreet developed plans for the capture of Louisbourg, although it is not clear whether these plans were ever implemented and to his dismay he was not given command of the expedition. However Bradstreet accepted a commission as lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Massachusetts Regiment and contributed to the final victory at Louisbourg, which fell after a siege in 1745.

===French and Indian War===
In 1755, Bradstreet, then a captain, was appointed as Governor William Shirley&#x27;s adjutant general. In 1756 he led a relief column to Fort Oswego with supplies. Upon his return he was attacked a combined French-Indian force. He survived but his warnings to Governor Shirley and Lord Loudon of the weak condition of Fort Oswego were largely ignored in midst of their ongoing power struggle. The French captured and burned Oswego later the same year. In the spring of 1757 he assembled supplies and transports at Boston for Loudoun&#x27;s abortive expedition against Louisbourg, and at Halifax in August he was among those who felt that the attack should not be postponed. On 27 December 1757 he was appointed Lt. Colonel and in 1758 he participated in the attack on Fort Carillon, where he led the advance guard following the death of General George Howe. The Battle ended in disaster and Bradstreet attempted to organize some sort of retreat, which had turned into a chaotic rout. After the failed attempt to capture Ticonderoga, Bradstreet immediately proposed his idea to attack Fort Frontenac, the key French supply base on Lake Ontario. Bradstreet&#x27;s proposal met with approval from British planners and he was given a force of approximately 3,000 men to carry out the operation. Bradstreet reached Lake Ontario on 21 August and four days later was within sight of the fort, which surrendered on the 27th. After sacking and burning the fort, Bradstreet&#x27;s force retreated to British territory. With this attack the French had (at least temporarily) their supply line in the Great Lakes cut. Under the new British commander in North America, Jeffery Amherst, Bradstreet served as deputy quartermaster general in Albany, a lucrative position which he held until the end of the war. 

===Pontiac&#x27;s War===
Shortly after the French and Indian War, Bradstreet was appointed colonel in 1764 and was ordered to lead a force of 1,400 men to reinforce Fort Detroit in response to the outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War. His superiors considered Bradstreet to have mismanaged his final campaign; exceeding his orders by attempting to negotiate independent peace treaties and failing to act aggressively enough against Pontiac&#x27;s forces. This left his military reputation badly tarnished in later years, although he was still promoted to the rank of Major General in the British Army on 25 May 1772.

== Bateau and Transport Service ==
Bradstreet is often remembered today for his work organizing and leading a corps of armed boatmen and teamsters in the British service, tasked with moving supplies and troops along the inland waterways of upstate New York and the Great Lakes. A substantial logistical feat, the force was developed from 1756 and grew to the strength of several thousand men, organized into dozens of companies, using hundreds of bateaux and whaleboats to transport the thousands of tons of supplies and equipment necessary for Britain to wage war in the colonial Northwest by supplying the army&#x27;s far-flung outposts. Also a combat force, the &#x27;Battoe Men&#x27;, as they were sometimes called, took part in combat operations, most famously Bradstreet&#x27;s assault on Fort Frontenac/Carillon in 1758.

<doc id="1174453" wikidata="Q468490" url="?curid=1174453" title="Jang Dong-gun">
<text>Jang Dong-gun (born March 7, 1972) is a South Korean actor. He is best known for his leading roles in the films &quot;Friend&quot; (2001) and &quot;Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War&quot; (2004). Jang is one of the highest-paid actors and celebrity endorsers in Korea, consistently topping surveys by industry insiders of most bankable stars.

==Early life==
Jang Dong-gun spent his childhood in Yongsan District, Seoul, and later went on to study at the Korea National University of Arts School of Drama, though he dropped out before obtaining a degree.

==Career==
===1992–2003: Beginnings and breakout===

Jang first entered the entertainment world in a talent contest in 1992. He began by acting in TV dramas such as &quot;Iljimae&quot;, &quot;The Last Match&quot;, co-starring Shim Eun-ha,
and he eventually made his film debut in &quot;Repechage&quot; (1997) together with Kim Hee-sun.

By the late 1990s he had become quite popular in Korea, but he also became one of the first Korean stars to garner a fan following in other parts of Asia, after several of his TV dramas were screened there in the late nineties. In 1999, after acting in the critically acclaimed &quot;Nowhere to Hide&quot; as Park Joong-hoon&#x27;s younger partner, Jang moved on to star in a feature that was filmed on location in Shanghai. Titled &quot;Anarchists&quot;, this tale of five young terrorists from 1930s China helped to elevate his status even further.

Jang&#x27;s breakout came in early 2001 in &quot;Friend&quot;, which smashed the box office record set by &quot;Shiri&quot; to become (at the time) the biggest Korean film of all time. After playing the nice guy in almost all his previous roles, this portrayal of a tough-talking gangster from Busan led him to local stardom.
The following year he starred in the popular action blockbuster &quot;2009 Lost Memories&quot; set in a futuristic Great Japan, and appeared in the low-budget film &quot;The Coast Guard&quot; by controversial director Kim Ki-duk.

===2004–2011: Overseas popularity and Hollywood debut===
In 2004, Jang took the lead role in Kang Je-gyu&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, an epic film about two brothers set during the Korean War. The film broke &quot;Friend&quot;&#x27;s record with an astounding 11 million tickets sold. By this time, Jang&#x27;s name had become known widely throughout Asia.

Jang followed this up with &quot;The Promise&quot;, a $30 million pan-Asian production by Chinese director Chen Kaige in which he played opposite Hong Kong star Cecilia Cheung. Meanwhile, he was cast in &quot;Typhoon&quot; as a modern-day pirate who has been betrayed by both North and South Korea. Directed by &quot;Friend&quot;&#x27;s Kwak Kyung-taek, &quot;Typhoon&quot; set a new record in 2005 for the highest production budget in Korean film history at $15 million.

For the next four years, Jang kept a low profile in the Korean entertainment sphere as he worked on his Hollywood debut &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Way&quot;, also starring Kate Bosworth and Geoffrey Rush. The film encountered problems with post-production and distribution, and was only released in 2010.

He returned to the silver screen in 2009 as the nation&#x27;s youngest (and most eligible) head of state in Jang Jin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Good Morning, President&quot;.

He reunited with director Kang Je-gyu in &quot;My Way&quot;, a film set during World War II based on the true story of a Korean soldier who is drafted by the Japanese army and eventually is present at the Battle of Normandy. A large-scale, ambitious pan-Asian collaboration co-starring Japanese actor Joe Odagiri and Chinese actress Fan Bingbing, &quot;My Way&quot; was the most expensive Korean movie to date (with an estimated budget of ), But despite being simultaneously released in Korea and Japan in December 2011, the film flopped at the box office.

===2012–present: Return to television===
Jang made his highly anticipated return to television dramas in &quot;A Gentleman&#x27;s Dignity&quot;, saying he was drawn to the romantic comedy tale of 40-something-year-old men struggling to grow up and mend and forge lasting relationships. After the series ended, Jang and co-star Kim Min-jong visited refugees in the Republic of the Congo on a mission trip sponsored by UNICEF, UNHCR and World Food Programme. It was televised on SBS documentary program &quot;Hope TV&quot;.

His 2012 film &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; was a Chinese adaptation of the French literature classic set in 1930s Shanghai, directed by Hur Jin-ho and co-starring Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung.

Jang next starred in &quot;No Tears for the Dead&quot;, an action thriller directed by Lee Jeong-beom. He played a Korean-born American hitman who feels conflicted about killing his last target (played by Kim Min-hee).

In 2015, Jang was cast in the film &quot;Seven Years of Night&quot;, a revenge thriller based on the novel of the same name by Jung Yoo-jung. He plays a character who takes revenge on his daughter&#x27;s murderer, by killing his son. The film premiered in 2018.

In 2016, Jang was cast in his first Chinese drama, &quot;Once Loved You Distressed Forever&quot; alongside actress Tang Yixin. He was then cast in the espionage noir thriller &quot;VIP&quot;, which premiered in 2017.

Jang returned to the small screen after five years, starring in the Korean remake of the popular American legal drama series &quot;Suits&quot; (2018). The same year, Jung starred in Kim Sung-hoon&#x27;s period zombie action film &quot;Rampant&quot; alongside close friend Hyun Bin.

In 2019, Jang starred in the fantasy historical drama &quot;Arthdal Chronicles&quot;.

Jang is a practicing Buddhist, having first explored Buddhist reading while hospitalized in high school, after undergoing chest surgery.

He enjoys playing baseball and is a member of the celebrity amateur baseball team &quot;Playboys&quot; with Lee Jong-hyuk, Hyun Bin, Kim Seung-woo, Hwang Jung-min, Ji Jin-hee, and other actors.

=== Relationship and marriage ===
The famously private actor surprised the country in November 2009 when he went public with his two-year romance with Ko So-young. Since co-starring together in the 1999 film &quot;Love Wind Love Song&quot;, rumors about Jang and Ko had spread several times in the past, but both had consistently denied them. The announcement immediately sparked speculation of an impending marriage although it wasn&#x27;t until March 2010 that Jang officially told his fans at a fan meeting that he would be marrying Ko in May. After months of media frenzy leading up to their nuptials, the two tied the knot on May 2, 2010 in an extravagant wedding ceremony at Seoul&#x27;s Shilla Hotel which was attended by their A-list celebrity friends, reporters and fans from around the world.

Their son, Jang Min-joon, was born on October 4, 2010. Their second child, a daughter, was born on February 25, 2014.

<doc id="1174475" wikidata="Q1114675" url="?curid=1174475" title="Whirlwind (novel)">
<text>Whirlwind is a novel by James Clavell, first published in 1986. It forms part of the &quot;Asian Saga&quot; and is chronologically the last book in the series.

Set in Iran in early 1979, it follows the fortunes of a group of Struan&#x27;s helicopter pilots, Iranian officials and oil men and their families in the turmoil surrounding the fall of the Iranian monarchy and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini. Like many of Clavell&#x27;s novels, it is very long and is composed of many interweaving plot strands involving a large cast of characters, as well as a detailed portrayal of Iranian culture.

The novel is closely inspired by the true struggle of Bristow Helicopters to escape the revolutionary forces and get their employees and equipment out of the unstable, deteriorating situation in the region. Alan Bristow, chairman of Bristow Helicopter commissioned a journalist, Jackie Griffin, who was married to one of his employees to write a report on the events in Iran. Bristow then gave his friend, James Clavell the resulting script to form the basis of the novel. Much of the story mirrors these and other contemporary events. In February 1979, U.S. Ambassador Adolph &quot;Spike&quot; Dubs was murdered in Kabul after Afghan security forces burst in on his kidnappers, the actual event both mentioned and fictionalized into the plot of &quot;Whirlwind&quot;. Other companies operating in Iran faced similar dilemmas. For example, Ross Perot&#x27;s Electronic Data Systems similarly became very involved in the rescue of two executives from prison in Tehran, events dramatised in Ken Follett&#x27;s novel &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot;.

==Backstory==
When tai-pan Ian Dunross learned in &quot;Noble House&quot; that the North Sea may soon be wide open for oil exploration, he sent Andrew Gavallan to Scotland to quietly buy up real estate in Aberdeen so they would be positioned to take advantage of this trend. The North Sea oil rigs, once built, are serviced by helicopter, which leads to Gavallan being involved in the helicopter and oil services industries. These become main business ventures of Struan&#x27;s in Iran during the 1970s, as depicted in &quot;Whirlwind&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Gavallan, based in Scotland, runs S-G Helicopter company operating in Iran during the Shah&#x27;s reign. When Khomeini comes to power, Gavallan must get his pilots and their families, and his valuable helicopters, and the spare parts for the helicopters (of equal or greater value than the aircraft) out of the riot-torn country. Complicating matters is his power struggle with his company&#x27;s secret owner, the Noble House of Hong Kong. The pilots&#x27; escape efforts form the basic story and the action sweeps across many lives: lovers, spies, fanatics, revolutionaries, friends and betrayers. British, French, Finnish, American, Canadian, Australian and Iranian are all caught up in a deadly religious and political upheaval, portraying the chilling and bewildering encounters when Westernized lifestyle clashes with harsh ancient traditions.

===Equipment===
Aircraft used by S-G Helicopters throughout the story include the Bell 212, Bell 206, and Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopters and the British Aerospace BAe 125 business jet.

===Locations===
The settings for the story are the western and southwestern parts of Iran, as well as neighboring Persian Gulf states, Turkey to Lake Van, and the environs of Aberdeen, Scotland.

Actual locations within Iran include Tehran (including Qasr Prison, Evin Prison,
Galeg Morghi, and Doshan Tappeh Air Base), Tabriz, Qazvin, Mount Sabalan, the Zagros Mountains, Lengeh, Bandar Delam, Siri, the Dez Dam and Kharg island.

==Writing==
Clavell got the idea for a book in 1975 when he visited Iran for the first time. He felt it had the potential to become &quot;a country that seemed likely to become the No. 3 power in the world.&quot; Clavell: 
I toured the country in a helicopter with an old friend of mine who was in the oil business. We went everywhere. I saw how helicopters and an international team of pilots were essential to the oil industry. Immediately, I knew it lent itself to a novel. But I had other projects going so I put it aside. Then the revolution occurred. Now there were all these stories about the horrors of living through someone else&#x27;s revolution. It all came together in my mind as the story of a multinational group of copter pilots caught up in an ugly revolution. Of course, that&#x27;s all I knew. I never have a plan before I begin a novel.
Clavell was completing &quot;Noble House&quot; at the time and was preparing to start a sequel to &quot;Shogun&quot; called &quot;Nippon&quot; (which became &quot;Gai-Jin&quot;). But at his wife&#x27;s urging he put that work on the back burner and took up the Iran book. He says he never told his publisher he had switched topics.
They all continued to think I was writing a book about Japan. I never liked anyone to know what I&#x27;m doing. It&#x27;s self-defense. When I was writing &#x27;Shogun,&#x27; my publisher was asked at a sales meeting what Clavell was working on and when he said &#x27;A book about 17th Century Japan,&#x27; they all roared &#x27;Who the hell&#x27;s interested in THAT?&#x27; If I told them I was writing about Iran, they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Oh, another book on the hostage crisis.&#x27; But it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s an adventure story that will hopefully tell people a lot they didn&#x27;t know about the motivations of Moslem fundamentalists.
Clavell spent four years researching and writing the book. Clavell:
I learned to fly a helicopter. I read the Koran for the second time (the first was as a POW), I read anything the Shah had written, anything by his sister, by Khomaini. I read about the cults, about Sufism and 100 other books, about the Caucasus, the war years, the partition of Iran between Russia and Britain, I read about Ali, the first of the Imams.
&quot;Whirlwind&quot; was written in the alpine country around the Swiss resort of Gstaad, and in the south of France, where Clavell lived. He started writing in 1982 and finished it in late 1985.

Clavell auctioned off the rights to the novel after having written only 200 pages. He was paid $5 million, a record amount at the time.

==&quot;Escape: The Love Story from Whirlwind&quot;==

A much shorter version of the story, focusing on a single pair of characters (Erikki Yokkonen and his wife Azadeh), was published in 1994 as &quot;Escape: The Love Story from &quot;Whirlwind. It is 598 pages long in paperback edition. The back cover of the first edition bore a message from the author humorously dedicating the book to anyone who had ever complained that his books were too heavy. &quot;Escape&quot; also includes story details not included in &quot;Whirlwind&quot;. Hard to find for many years, it returned to circulation when Clavell&#x27;s &quot;Asian Saga&quot; was republished in 2016.

<text>A narrow-[[antimicrobial spectrum|spectrum]] antibiotic is an antibiotic that is only able to kill or inhibit limited species of bacteria. Examples of narrow-spectrum antibiotics include fidaxomicin and sarecycline.

==Advantages==
* Narrow-spectrum antibiotic allow to kill or inhibit only those bacteria species that are unwanted (i.e. causing disease). As such, it leaves most of the beneficial bacteria unaffected, hence minimizing the collateral damage on the microbiota.
* Low propensity for bacterial resistance development.

==Disadvantages==
Often, the exact species of bacteria causing the illness is unknown, in which case narrow-spectrum antibiotics can&#x27;t be used, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are used instead. To know the exact species of bacteria causing the illness, clinical specimens need to be taken for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in a clinical microbiology laboratory.

<text>Bob Fisher (born 1961) is an American screenwriter whose credits include &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, the 2011 Fox comedy series &quot;Traffic Light&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re the Millers&quot;. He is a co-writer and co-executive producer for the US adaptation of &quot;Sirens&quot;.

In 2014, he spoke at an event at Cal State Long Beach&#x27;s Hall of Science; he talked about how he became a screenwriter. He said that he considered attending law school after college but instead became a bartender. While a student he read an article about television writers and how well they were paid. This gave him the idea to begin writing his own scripts for practice. His first screenwriting job was in 1995 for &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot;.

His latest film, &quot;We&#x27;re the Millers&quot;, took 12 years to make and generated more than $270 million at the box office.

<text>The Bajaj Pulsar is a range of motorcycles manufactured by Bajaj Auto in India. It was developed by the product engineering division of Bajaj Auto in association with Tokyo R&amp;D, and later with motorcycle designer Glynn Kerr. A variant of the bike, the Pulsar 200NS was launched in 2012, but it was suspended for some time (reintroduced in early 2017 with BS IV Emission compliance and renamed the NS200). With average monthly sales of around 86,000 units in 2011, Pulsar claimed a 2011 market share of 47% in its segment. By April 2012, more than five million units of Pulsar were sold. In 2018, they celebrated selling over ten million Pulsars backed an exclusive TV commercial and a marquee ride to in 6 cities to write &quot;PULSAR&quot; on a pre-defined route. The model is also sold as Rouser under other markets, such as South America.

Before the introduction of the Pulsar, the Indian motorcycle market trend was towards fuel efficient, small capacity motorcycles (that formed the 80–125 cc class). Bigger motorcycles with higher capacity virtually did not exist (except for Royal Enfield Bullet with 350cc and 500cc variants). The launch and success of Hero Honda CBZ in 1999 showed that there was demand for performance bikes. Bajaj took the cue from there on and launched the Pulsar twins (150cc and 180cc) in India on 24 November 2001. Since the introduction and success of Bajaj Pulsar, Indian youth began expecting high power and other features from affordable motorcycles.

The project faced internal resistance, reservations by McKinsey &amp; Company and doubts on its effects on Bajaj&#x27;s relation with Kawasaki. The project took approximately 36 months for completion and cost Bajaj 1 billion.

==History==
===2001===
The Bajaj Pulsar &quot;Twins&quot; were launched on 24 November 2001. The first generation Pulsar had a 150/180cc two valve, air-cooled, single-cylinder, four-stroke engine which made 12/15 bhp of maximum power respectively. It featured a single spark plug to ignite the air-fuel mixture fed from a carburetor, simple spring shock absorbers, round headlamp dome, voluminous 18 L fuel tank and a 1,265 mm wheelbase. Disc brakes as standard equipment was a novelty in Indian motorcycles of the early 2000s.

The 180 cc version made 15 bhp and came with a twin-tone horn, which was optional equipment on the 150 cc version. Electric Start (ES) and Engine Killswitch was offered as standard feature in the 180 cc model and optional on the 150 cc model.

===2003===

The second generation Pulsars featured Bajaj Auto&#x27;s newly developed DTSi (Digital Twin Spark Ignition) technology, which increased the power rating of both versions by each and also increased fuel economy. This model also introduced a new headlamp assembly, 1,320 mm wheelbase, and standard twin-tone horn and trip meter.20

===2005===
In 2005, Bajaj launched Pulsar 150. The bike was offered with alloy wheels as standard option, and the stance was also lowered by about 12 mm. The fuel tank had a capacity of only 15 litres when compared to the original 18 litres, this was done in order to make the tank look proportionate with the new low-slung stance. The power output was further increased to @ 8500 rpm for the 150 while it increased to @ 8500 rpm for the 180. The rear shock absorbers were gas-filled Nitrox absorbers.
===2006===
In 2006, Bajaj introduced another version of Pulsar (UG III). New features included pilot lamps separated from the main headlamp, turn indicators with clear lenses and amber bulb, self-cancelling turn indicator switch, flush LCD screen with digital read-out of key vehicle data, non-contact speed sensor, non-contact backlit switches, twin-stripe LED tail-light assembly, and side panels altered for a sharp, tapering-towards-the-rear look. The engine had increased torque availability, reduced vibration, and improved gear shift feel.
===2007===
In July 2007, Bajaj began selling the Bajaj Pulsar 220 DTS-Fi and Pulsar 180 DTS-i, the former featuring fuel injection and oil cooled engines, a digital dash, and modern styling. This bike has some features which are totally new to the Indian market, like the fuel injection itself, rear disc brake and clip-on handlebars (the first two only available in the 220 model).

===2008===
The new Pulsar has many firsts to its credit. It comes equipped with an oil cooler, which helps control engine oil temperatures at sustained high speeds and rpms, thus ensuring more stable engine oil viscosity.

The new digital console is an advanced version of the latest Pulsar family. Apart from the Digital Odometer, Digital Speedo Meter, Digital Fuel Gauge, Self Cancelling Indicators and two Digital Trip Meters, the console on the 180 cc Pulsar DTS-I has indicators for the air filter condition, engine temperature, battery voltage and oil level.
Later 200cc version was discontinued and fuel injection system of 220 was replaced with carburetor which resulted in cost reduction to Rs 73000 ex showroom Delhi

===2009===
Bajaj released the UG IV (fourth upgrade) versions of the Pulsar 150 and Pulsar 180 in April 2009. The upgrades for the Pulsar 150 included an all-black theme, tank scoops similar to those on the Pulsar 200, a 3D Pulsar logo, and a changed electrical system (full DC). Power also increased from 13.5 HP to 14.09 HP (at 8,500 rpm).

Electrical enhancements like auto head light switch-off after few seconds of turning the engine off to protect the battery, self-cancelling turn signals, icon illumination (horn icon, indicator icon, engine cut off icon, etc.), side stand warning light, dual digital trip meter, low fuel warning light (which also flashes when the engine and Auto Choke System in 220 Variant.

The Pulsar 180 received upgrades like wider tyres, split seat, tank scoops, clip-on handlebars, 3D Pulsar logo, swing arm suspension borrowed from Pulsar 200, and thicker forks. The power was increased to 17 PS.

Bajaj launched a carbureted version of Pulsar 220 in June 2009, tagging it as &quot;the fastest bike in India&quot;. It also discontinued the production of Pulsar 200 in July 2009.

Bajaj also introduced a new Light Sports version of Pulsar named as Pulsar 135LS. It is the first bike in India to contain 4-valve DTS-i technology. It consists 4 smaller valves rather than 2 standard bigger valves, styling also is changed and looks become more aggressive. The bike is ARAI certified for 68.5 km/L and weights only 122 kg.

===2010===
Bajaj released the UG 4.5 versions of the Pulsar 150. The upgrades for the Pulsar 150 included clip-on handlebars like those in Pulsar 135LS. Power also increased from 14.09 HP to 15.06 HP (at 9,000 rpm).

The model badge was redesigned and did not feature &#x27;DTS-i&#x27; as in the previous models.
A naked version of Pulsar 220 is also launched, named as Pulsar 220S (Street Fighter) which retains everything from Pulsar 220 except the front fairing. Front fairing is similar to Pulsar 180/150. The former Pulsar 220 was renamed as Pulsar 220F.

===2011===
Bajaj released newer color schemes for the Pulsar 135LS, 150, 180 and 220F.
===2012===
2012 marked the entry of Bajaj&#x27;s latest design, the Pulsar 200NS (NS standing for Naked-Sport). The bike has a revised 200 cc liquid-cooled engine derived from the KTM 200 Duke, which produces at 9,500 rpm and at 8,000 rpm. It has a new triple-spark design, along with a new four-valve SOHC. The company claims a top speed of . It does not have fuel injection like its predecessor, the Pulsar 220Fi. It has a petal disc brake on the front, a disc brake on the rear wheel, and a gas-charged monoshock. It was launched in April 2012. Claimed fuel economy is when ridden under . Design of the 200NS was by Bajaj lead designer Edgar Heinrich, who left Bajaj to become head of BMW Motorrad design in mid-2012.

===2014===
At the February 2014 Auto Expo, Bajaj announced two new 375 cc Pulsar variants : the CS400, an unfaired &quot;street-naked&quot; compared stylistically to the Ducati Diavel, and the SS400, with a full fairing. Models shown were described by press as &quot;near-production prototypes.&quot;. Later in the following year the a bike looking similar to the SS400 came into production with a 200cc fuel injected engine derived from the NS200, with full fairing and twin projector headlamps and was named as Pulsar RS200. It also is the first Pulsar to get Single Channel ABS as an option.

===2015===
In April 2015, Bajaj launched the Pulsar RS200, AS150 and AS200 in which &#x27;RS&#x27; stood for &#x27;Race Sport&#x27; whereas &#x27;AS&#x27; stood for &#x27;Adventure Sport&#x27;. The RS200 is Bajaj&#x27;s first attempt at a fully faired motorcycle whereas the AS series featured semi-fairing with projector headlamps common among them all. The AS200 got the same 199.5cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine that also powers the RS200 with the exception of fuel injection. Mated to a 6-speed transmission, this engine churns out a maximum power output of 23.17 PS at 9,500rpm along with a peak torque of 18.3 Nm at 8,000rpm. While the AS200 is based on the 200NS platform, the AS150 is built on a new perimeter frame instead of the standard Pulsar 150 Dtsi. The motorcycle derives its power from a 149.5cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, produces 16.8bhp at 9,000rpm and 13Nm at 7,500rpm. The RS200 makes slightly higher power output at 24.5PS that peaks out (compared to the AS200) at 9,750rpm and 18.6 Nm torque at 8000 rpm owing to its fuel injection. On late 2015 Bajaj had come up with dual tone design, especially for Pulsar 220 Fighter bikes, which was later discontinued for certain colors.

===2016 ===
The CS400 concept from the 2014 Auto Expo, went through a series or rebranding before release (Pulsar CS400, Pulsar VS400, Bajaj Kratos 400). Finally, it was separated from the Pulsar range and spawned as the Bajaj Dominar 400.

=== 2017 ===
The 200NS, which was temporarily discontinued in favor of the AS200, was reintroduced as the NS200 with an updated color scheme. Later in the year, NS200 received a Single Channel ABS Variant.
The entire Pulsar lineup (135LS, 150, 180, 220F, NS200, RS200) receives BS4 compliant engines and AHO (Always Headlamp On) as well as a new Laser Edge color scheme. The digital display on received newer graphics and a Blue back light instead of the previously Orange back light. The Pulsar 150 received mechanical changes to conform to BS4 norms, leading to a loss of 1 Ps of power. The Pulsar 180 received a 230mm rear disc brake instead of a drum brake.

A new model named the Pulsar NS160 was released soon after. It shared most of its styling and design with the NS200, but used a smaller 160cc Oil Cooled DTS-i engine producing 15.5 Ps of power at 8500 rpm and 14.6 Nm of peak torque at 6500 rpm. It also features a skinnier rear tire and does not offer a rear disc brake.

The NS200 and RS200 were rebadged and sold in the Malaysian market as the Modenas Pulsar NS200 and RS200.
Later NS 160 was equipped with a 120/80 rear tyre and disc brakes.

=== 2019 ===
A scale-down variant of the Pulsar series, the Pulsar 125, was launched in August 2019. It features the same specifications as its older counterpart, the Pulsar 150, albeit being powered by a 124.4 cc engine and has a smaller price tag. The bike produces 11.8 PS at 8500 rpm and has a 5-speed gearbox.

=== 2021 ===
Bajaj launched two new 250cc bikes, Pulsar F250 and N250 as successors of Pulsar 220 range on the mark of 20 years anniversary of Pulsar.

2022

Bajaj launched new series of 150/160 cc bikes in N250 line-up, namely Pulsar P150 and Pulsar N160.

2023

Bajaj terminated the Pulsar P150, replacing it with new Pulsar N150 that followed the body style of N160-N250.

2024

Bajaj Updated the Pulsar NS Series (NS125, NS160, NS200). The updated NS now have a new LED headlight with DRLs and LCD digital instrument cluster. Bajaj introduced and launched the Pulsar NS400Z in India. The Pulsar NS400Z gets 373cc single cylinder engine which was used in Dominar 400. In November 2024, Bajaj launched the second 125cc naked bike after NS125, the Pulsar N125, which also uses 125cc l1 engine.

===2025===
On January 2025, Bajaj Discontinued the Pulsar F250, due to low sales. The Pulsar F250 was expected to succeed the Pulsar 220F, but Bajaj Still sells Pulsar 220F with a BS6 engine.

==Technology==

===DTSi===
DTSi stands for Digital Twin Spark Ignition, a Bajaj Auto trademark. Bajaj Auto holds an Indian patent for the DTSi technology. The Alfa Romeo Twin-Spark engines, the BMW F650 Funduro which was sold in India from 1995 to 1997 also had a twin-spark plug technology, and the Rotax motorcycle engines, more recently Honda&#x27;s iDSI Vehicle engines use a similar arrangement of two spark-plugs. However very few small capacity engines did eventually implement such a scheme in their production prototypes.

====Patent infringement====

In September 2007, Bajaj Auto filed a claim accusing that the development of TVS Flame was in violation of their patent for DTS-I.
TVS Motors decided to sue Bajaj Auto for libel.
In February 2008, the Madras High Court in Chennai restrained TVS from launching it with the twin spark plug technology.
TVS appealed against this decision, claiming that crucial evidence was not taken into account
and in March 2008, launched the Flame with a modified engine containing one spark plug. The DTSi idea is a simple one to understand – it involved usage of two spark plugs (instead of one) per engine cylinder. On 16 September 2009, the Supreme Court of India permitted TVS Motors to manufacture and sell the 125 cc TVS Flame with Twin Spark Technology until the pendency of the suit before the Madras High Court, but it shall maintain accurate records of its sales all over the country.

===ExhausTEC===
ExhausTEC stands for Exhaust Torque Expansion Chamber, a technology patented by Bajaj. The technology involves use of a small chamber connected to the exhaust pipe of the engine to modify the back-pressure and the swirl characteristics, with an aim to improve the low-end performance of the bikes. The ExhausTEC technology is claimed to be highly effective in improving the low and mid-range torque.

===Copy of Pulsar brand motorcycles===
There were several allegations of IPR infringement by Chinese manufacturers in Sri Lankan and South American markets. Pulsar clone versions are sold in Bangladesh also.
The &#x27;Tomahawk&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by Hong Kong-based Giantco Limited, &#x27;YB200&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by China-based Taizhou City Kaitong Motorcycle Manufacture Co., Limited (the company which made a clone of Piaggio MP3), &#x27;ZX200-7(G) and ZX200-7(II)&#x27; motorcycles manufactured by China-based Jiangsu Zhongxing Motor Group Co., Limited, &#x27;RT150-8&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by China-based Chongqing Rato Power Co., Limited, &#x27;SM150-GB’ motorcycle manufactured by China-based Pantera Motorcycle Co., Limited, &#x27;HJ200-23&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by China-based Guangzhou Panyu Haojian Motorcycle Industry Co., Limited, &#x27;VL150-30, VL150-28 &amp; VL150-26&#x27; motorcycles manufactured by China-based Veli Technology Industrial Co., Limited, &#x27;SUM200 Pulsar&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by China-based Chongqing Union Co., Limited, &#x27;YG200-7A&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by China-based Chongqing Yingang Sci.&amp;Tech.(Group) Co., Limited and &#x27;YX150-CS&#x27; motorcycle manufactured by China-based Chongqing YInxiang Motorcycle (Group) Co., Limited are some famous replicas of Pulsar brand motorcycles&#x27; Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 Sports Bike.

<doc id="1174521" wikidata="Q3267537" url="?curid=1174521" title="USS Hammerhead (SS-364)">
<text>USS &quot;Hammerhead&quot; (SS-364), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark, a shark found in warm seas with a flattened anterior forward of the gill slits, presenting a hammer-like silhouette when viewed from above.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hammerhead&quot; initially was ordered as a unit of the &quot;Balao&quot; class, but her builder, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company, did not receive the drawings for the &quot;Balao&quot; class from the Electric Boat Company in time to build &quot;Hammerhead&quot; or the submarines , , and to the new design, so they were built as &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines. Thus, in some references, these four submarines are listed as units of the &quot;Balao&quot;-class.

&quot;Hammerhead&quot; was launched on 24 October 1943 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, sponsored by Mrs. R. W Berry, and commissioned on 1 March 1944.

==Operational history==
After a month&#x27;s training in Lake Michigan, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; was placed in a floating drydock and towed down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she arrived on 8 April 1944. She subsequently proceeded to Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, for further training, and thence to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

=== First patrol, June – August 1944 ===

The submarine departed Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 6 June 1944 in company with and . Cruising the seas south of Formosa, her first engagement came 9 June when she sank a sampan with gunfire. She then encountered a coastal oiler 29 June and closed for the attack, but the torpedoes failed to strike home and a surprise aerial attack forced the sub down. At the Next day, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; damaged several ships of a convoy. She made port at Fremantle, Australia 17 August 1944.

=== Second patrol, September – November 1944 ===

&quot;Hammerhead&quot;&#x27;s second war patrol was conducted in the Java and South China Seas. She departed Fremantle 9 September and made her first attack the night of 1 October, when a convoy consisting of four cargo ships, one oiler, and three escorts was detected off Borneo. &quot;Hammerhead&quot; fired 10 torpedoes, scored a total of 6 hits, and sent 3 of the cargo ships to the bottom (&quot;Hiyori Maru&quot;, &quot;Higane Maru&quot;, &quot;Kokusei Maru&quot;).

The morning of 20 October the submarine found still another six ship convoy, and after evading one of the escorts delivered a six-torpedo attack. Two more cargo ships fell victim to &quot;Hammerhead&quot;&#x27;s marksmanship. The submarine returned from this highly successful patrol 2 November 1944, and was later awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her outstanding performance.

=== Third and fourth patrols, November 1944 – March 1945 ===

The submarine commenced her third war patrol 25 November, returning to the South China Sea. On this cruise she operated with and , and although several attacks were made, no sinkings resulted. She returned to Fremantle 17 January 1945.

&quot;Hammerhead&quot; departed on her fourth war patrol 19 February, in company with . Patrolling off Cape Varella, she detected a convoy and two escorts 23 February and while closing the cargo ships obtained a perfect shot on an escort. A spread of four torpedoes sank Japanese frigate &quot;Yaku&quot;. Due to the illness of her commanding officer, the submarine was forced to end her patrol, and moored at Subic Bay 3 March 1945.

===Fifth and sixth patrols, March – May 1945 ===

Beginning her fifth war patrol 10 March 1945, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; proceeded to the coast of Indochina, where on 29 March she detected a large escorted convoy. Working her way inside the screen, the submarine was able to get a clear shot at an escort vessel, and a single hit broke her in two. After sinking the escort, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; damaged other members of the group before retiring. She returned from this war patrol 6 April 1945, mooring at Subic Bay, Philippines.

For her sixth war patrol &quot;Hammerhead&quot; operated in the Gulf of Siam. She arrived 6 May and that night encountered a small tanker and two escorts. After missing with two torpedoes at extreme range the submarine found the mark in a second attack, sinking the tanker &quot;Kinrei Maru&quot;. &quot;Hammerhead&quot; attacked other ships of the convoy without success and after a depth charge attack decided to break off. Sighting a cargo carrier 14 May with only an aircraft escort, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; made a perfect approach and sank the ship with two torpedoes. She returned from this patrol 25 May.

=== Seventh patrol, June – August 1945 ===

&quot;Hammerhead&quot; departed Fremantle 21 June on her seventh and last war patrol, also carried out in the Gulf of Siam, in company with three other submarines. Her major attack of this patrol occurred 10 July, when she sank cargo ships &quot;&quot;Sakura Maru&quot;&quot; and &quot;Nanmei Maru No. 5&quot;. The patrol was brought to a close 21 August 1945 at Pearl Harbor.

=== Decommissioning, 1945 ===

&quot;Hammerhead&quot; arrived Mare Island, Calif., for decommissioning 20 August 1945 and decommissioned 9 February 1946. She was then placed in the Reserve Fleet at Mare Island.

===1952–1953 ===

&quot;Hammerhead&quot; was brought out of reserve during the Korean War, recommissioned 6 February 1952, and engaged in training duty on the United States West Coast between San Diego and San Francisco, California, until 21 August 1953, when she decommissioned for return to the Reserve Fleet.

===July–October 1954===
Earmarked for loan under the Military Assistance Program, &quot;Hammerhead&quot; was converted to a GUPPY submarine at Mare Island Naval Shipyard and recommissioned once more 16 July 1954 to prepare for transfer. She was decommissioned on 23 October 1954 and loaned to Turkey the same day.

=== TCG &quot;Cerbe&quot; (S 341) ===

The submarine was commissioned by the Turkish Navy on 23 October 1954 as TCG &quot;Cerbe&quot; (S 03), the Turkish name of the island of Djerba. She was the first submarine of that name, a reference to the 1560 Battle of Djerba. She later was redesignated S 341. The United States formally sold &quot;Cerbe&quot; to Turkey on 1 January 1972. She was decommissioned on 4 May 1972 and subsequently scrapped.

<text>Hunter Burgan (born May 14, 1976) is an American multi-instrumentalist. He is the second and current bassist of AFI.

== Biography ==

Burgan grew up in Grass Valley, California. He is a vegan.

== Career ==
Burgan was bassist in The Force when joining Ukiah, California-based rock band AFI, meant as a temporary replacement for regular bassist, Geoff Kresge, for touring and a record, &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot;, but eventually became AFI&#x27;s full-time bassist in November 1997. The Force broke up in September 1998.

Burgan loves Prince&#x27;s music and even had his own side-project called Hunter Revenge dedicated to singing early-80s-style R&amp;B. A talented multi-instrumentalist, Burgan can play drums, bass, guitar, saxophone, clarinet, and piano. He was the drummer and one of the founding members of the Frisk, who played their final show in December 2005. He was the drummer of the Nevada City, California, band, Badical Turbo Radness (BTR) in the mid 1990s. He has also played drums for the Eyeliners, Gardening, Not Architecture, F-Minus (one show), and the Halo Friendlies on tour.

Hunter was featured on Tegan and Sara&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;The Con&quot;, playing bass on the songs written by Tegan. He appeared with them on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; playing the shakers on the song &quot;Back in Your Head.&quot; He has also confirmed an upcoming side project with Tegan, and contributed lyrics to three of her songs on the 2009 album &quot;Sainthood&quot;.
He also played bass on Golden Shoulders&#x27;s &quot;Little Nixon,&quot; from their 2009 album &quot;Get Reasonable&quot;.

He is often referred to simply as &quot;Hunter,&quot; as his last name is never given in the list of band members on AFI&#x27;s albums, with the exception of Crash Love. He plays Fender American Jazz Basses and Ampeg Amps.

In May 2011, when asked why he had stopped recording with his Hunter Revenge project, Burgan stated &quot;I had a lot of fun writing songs in a very specific style. However that is not the only style of music I want to write and can write.&quot; He also noted &quot;I&#x27;m doing a lot of other music stuff now that&#x27;s in different styles that are at least a little of a better representation of what I want to do musically.&quot;

Burgan joined Alkaline Trio&#x27;s Matt Skiba and My Chemical Romance&#x27;s Jarrod Alexander to form Matt Skiba and the Sekrets, which released their debut album &quot;Babylon&quot; on May 8, 2012.
